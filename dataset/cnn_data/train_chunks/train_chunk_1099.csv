"When the world's tallest water slide finally opens in July it will be, as this first person-angle video shows, be absolutely terrifying. The Verruckt, meaning insane, will see its riders drop 17 storeys or 168-foot-tall - further down than if they were jumping off Niagara Falls. The opening date at Schlitterbahn Kansas City Waterpark was delayed for a third time by problems with the conveyor system that transports the rafts punters lay on to the top of the slide - it was originally due to open in May - but the park is confident it will be open for business in July. While the launch for local and national was cancelled, co-owner of the park Jeff Henry compared the experience of riding the attraction 'jumping off the Empire State Building'. He's also said it was 'the scariest thing [he'd] done'. Scroll down for video . Further than Niagra Falls: Kansas City's The Verruckt, meaning insane, is the world's tallest water slide .

The park has been forced to delay the ride's official opening for a third time at the weekend after media members were scheduled to take rides Thursday and Friday. A Schlitterbahn Waterpark spokeswoman Winter Prosapio said glitches last weekend with the conveyor hadn't been resolved in time for that to happen. Verruckt was certified as the world's tallest water slide in April by Guinness World Records. Prosapio said park officials would not hesitate to delay operation for however long it takes to make sure the slide is safe. 'We'll take embarrassment before putting someone in the slide when it is not ready,' she said. Scroll down for video . No risks: A spokeswoman for the waterpark said they'd rather face embarrassment than risk injuries . Sunday's opening was to coincide with a one-hour special on the Travel Channel titled 'Xtreme Waterparks' documenting the designing and building of Verruckt. The slide's drop is so steep, it is almost at a right-angle to the ground and to get up to the top of it, thrill-seekers must climb 264 steps. There they wait for their turn on a deck made from railroad tanker cars before speeding down, up a five-storey hump and then back down a second slide into the final pool. Before the Verruckt, the record holder for tallest water slide was the 134.5ft Insano slide in Fortaleza, Brazil.

"For many of us, a few simple images of our last holiday will suffice as mementos. Perhaps we take a few quick snaps on our camera-phone and upload them to Instagram, perhaps we make a short video to capture a special moment – or perhaps we reel off an enormous range of photos, then leave them to capture digital dust on a memory card. Standing at the edge of America: 'Riceman 2011' visits the USA's southernmost point at Key West . But for one particular tourist on a sight-seeing mission around the United States, such little travel fragments are not enough. Nowhere near enough. Identified as ‘Riceman 2011’, this young trail-blazer has spent considerable time and effort on visiting all 50 states of the USA – and proving his arrival by standing in front of a recognisable landmark or backdrop, and filming a short burst of footage that captures him waving the American flag with a broad grin on his face. Patriotic stuff, we can agree. The trip was completed last month, with ‘Riceman 2011’ announcing that it was ‘shown in the spirit of Independence Day’. Feeling fruity: The young traveller visits the Pineapple Garden Maze on Oahu in Hawaii . Braving the big city: The state-trotting tourist ticks off Illinois via a visit to Chicago . His journey seems to have been all-encompassing, making sure to venture to the furthest corners of American territory – including the sun-kissed confines of Oahu, in Hawaii, and the frozen contours of Alaska, in the height of winter. He is also pictured standing at the monument which marks the southernmost point of the USA – at the lowest edge of Key West in Florida. A less known corner of the country: Another day, another state - this time Kansas . Heading deep into the country: Now it's a foray into the Deep South, and South Carolina . The Alaska leg of the odyssey was clearly the most demanding, the footage showing ‘Riceman 2011’ grimacing in sub-zero temperatures as snow billows around him. Although the extent of his travels is apparent, he gives away little about himself except to reveal that he hails from Texas. ‘The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of TEXAS!’ he says of his home patch – before adding: ‘But I love all the states.’","Determined American tourist covers all 50 US states in one concise video .

"There has been a lot of woeful decisions in the Premier League in recent weeks. But the decision to rule out Jan Vertonghen’s second goal at White Hart Lane surely tops the lot when it comes to embarrassing the art of officiating.

"CLICK HERE to read the full match report . Radamel Falcao's future at Manchester United was in fresh doubt on Sunday night after Louis van Gaal axed the Colombia star from his squad against Southampton. The move backfired as United suffered their first defeat at home to Saints in the league for 27 years, and failed to have a single shot on goal at Old Trafford for the first time since May 2009. Falcao’s omission was a major surprise and will inevitably raise questions over his prospects of persuading United to spend £52million to turn his loan from Monaco into a permanent move at the end of the season. Radamel Falcao was not included in Louis van Gaal's squad to face Southampton on Sunday . Falcao trains ahead of Manchester United's clash with Southampton on Friday . Dusan Tadic (centre) strips off to celebrate his goal in Southampton's 1-0 victory over Unite . United players trudge off at Old Trafford after failing to register a single shot on target . The former FC Porto and Atletico Madrid striker, who earns £280,000-a-week at Old Trafford, had started the previous five games and scored twice. But he was left out of the 18-man squad altogether with Van Gaal choosing to name teenage striker James Wilson and no fewer than three centre-backs on the bench. United ended the game with Marouane Fellaini up front alongside Wayne Rooney. It is understood that the United boss had not explained the reasons for his decision to Falcao, and the player then watched the 1-0 defeat from a private box. ‘Falcao isn’t injured he’s just not selected in the squad,’ said Van Gaal, who admitted beforehand that one of his star forwards would have to miss out now they are all fit. ‘It’s much more difficult selecting a side but that’s the task of the manager and I have a staff who advise me as well. ‘We have now a lot of players who are coming back and he has played the last few matches in a row. Then I have to compare players with each other. Saints boss Ronald Koeman (left) would have enjoyed getting the upper hand over Louis van Gaal . Falcao was a surprise loan signing  with United given the option to buy him outright at the end of the season . The on-loan Monaco striker has spoken of his desire to remain at Old Trafford beyond this season . The Columbia international has only started eight Premier League games since his arrival . ‘Now he is out of the 18 but that is this moment. Next week is another moment. ‘When you see the composition of my bench I don’t have (room) for a second striker. ‘You have to compare players before the match, and after the match you can say you could have won if a player had participated but you shall never know. ‘It is a bad result. When you are dominating the game like we did, you have to create more chances. Southampton came for a draw, I believe, and they go away with a victory and that is disappointing. We gave the goal away.’ Falcao appeared to be settling into English football after regaining full fitness following a serious knee injury and a calf problem. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman admitted that he expected to see the striker in United’s starting line-up. ‘I was surprised but I don’t know the reason,’ said Koeman. ‘If he is injured, it is normal. Maybe it is a good question to Mr Van Gaal.’ Dusan Tadic’s 69th minute goal ended United’s 11-game unbeaten run in all competitions and saw Southampton move above Van Gaal’s side into third place in the Premier League. Falcao has reportedly taken time to adapt to United manager Louis van Gaal's precise philosophy . The 28-year-old celebrates scoring his first Premier League goal against Everton in October . Koeman believes that his team are capable of staying there for the rest of the season to qualify for the Champions League. ‘If we keep the spirit and the organisation, we can keep in front in the table,’ he said. ‘We got a point against Chelsea and the three points against Arsenal. That makes belief in the players. That is what you need if you are not a big club, not to be afraid of the name or the stadium. We learned that. I am not surprised we won today. We have organisation. We have 11 clean sheets in 21 games. ‘They (United) didn’t create much. The second half was more comfortable. They put Fellaini up front, played the long balls and it was difficult. But we defended well and the spirit was unbelievable.’ Koeman was unhappy with Tadic after he was booked for taking off his shirt in celebration when he scored just six minutes after coming off the bench. The Serbian’s introduction was delayed because his No.11 jersey was back in the dressing-room and he had also lost his shin pads. Koeman celebrates with Southampton goal scorer Tadic after the final whistle on Sunday . The former Ajax manager issues instructions to his team during the match at Old Trafford . Tadic and his Southampton team-mates celebrate after he scores in the 2-0 win against Arsenal . ‘It is a yellow card and a stupid fault,’ said Koeman. ‘Your second and it is a red. When it is the last minute of the season and you have qualified for Europe, it is not problem. But I don’t like that. Keep your shirt on.’ Tadic defended his actions, saying: ‘When you score a goal you don’t think about celebrating. You do what you feel in the moment. I don't know why I took my top off, I never do that. But there is always a first time. ‘In the first half I put the shirt and shin pads there and then in the second half I wanted to come on and they were not there. I don’t know what happened.’ United skipper Wayne Rooney insisted that they only had themselves to blame after suffering a first defeat since the Manchester derby in early November. ‘I think we deserved to win the game today,’ said Rooney. ‘Overall we had the better chances, played the better football and deserved to win but we’ve been punished for not taking our chances. ‘I’ve seen Southampton play better, to be honest. We stopped a lot of their threats but we got punished with the goal they scored. ‘We’re not fussed how big or small a day it is for Southampton, we’re focussed on us and we have to move on.’","Manchester United were beaten 1-0 by Southampton in the Premier League .

"Kell Brook got the job done at the weekend and now I think we are about to see Britain’s next great world champion. He is going to get what I believe he deserves – that title shot. We were told by the IBF last week that they have ruled on Shawn Porter, their champion. With Porter fighting Paulie Malignaggi on April 19, both men must now sign an agreement with the IBF that the winner will fight Brook within 90 days. Before July 19, I expect him to have his shot and to be a world champion. Dominant: Kell Brook thrashed Alvaro Robles at the Echo Arena in March . Date with destiny: The Sheffield boxer is set to earn a long-awaited world title shot . Like I wrote in a previous column, this is a guy who has had nothing but bad luck when it has come to world title shots. The postponements of his fight with Devon Alexander devastated him. I was with him watching Alexander’s fight with Porter when Alexander lost and with it went Brook’s scheduled title challenge. The look on his face. Now he is going to get what he deserves and I promise you it will be special. This guy has as much talent as any British fighter. When he is properly motivated he will beat anyone. The fight against Alvaro Robles was designed to blow away the cobwebs and break up his camp for the title shot. Now he will go straight back into training. Who will he face? It’s a tough one. You have to say Porter is the favourite, but if it’s Malignaggi who wins then I think a fight between him and Brook is big enough to hold here in the UK. I am keeping my fingers crossed on that one. Trio: Paulie Malignaggi (left) has fought Amir Khan (right) and Ricky Hatton and could soon face Brook . Frustration: Brook had been due to fight American Devon Alexander for a world title . Tony Bellew is one of my favourite fighters. He has had it hard, but he has as much heart as anyone in the sport. He won on Saturday and so we are looking at getting him that third shot at a world title. I am sure he is destined to win one and when he does it will make all the struggling worthwhile. I think the biggest step has already been taken and that was moving him from light heavyweight to cruiserweight. At the weigh-in on Friday he was 14st 1Ib – about a stone and a half more than what he used to weigh in at. He will be a real force at cruiserweight and I am already in discussions with Sauerland about a potential fight with WBO champions Marco Huck. He is ranked with the WBC and WBO so we are looking at title shots down both avenues and we always have an eye on Nathan Cleverly. Trilogy: Tony Bellew is set to receive another world title shot after his win at the Echo Arena on Saturday . Cruise: Bellew beat Russian Valery Brudov in a cruiserweight bout in Liverpool . Losing to Cleverly hurt Tony and he’d love another go at him. That would be another huge domestic fight and I think it would have a different result at this weight. Tony is such a lovely guy and he works so hard because he wants it so badly. At light-heavyweight he was a different person almost. He would get down to that weight and he would be a shell of himself and I also feel that he wasn’t given a full apprenticeship before he fought Cleverly. The fights he has had since, like Edison Miranda, Roberto Bolanti and Isaac Chilemba, he should have had before he was put in with Cleverly. Now we are getting him the right apprenticeship at this weight. Seeing him last week at this weight, he is so much more comfortable. He has a bit of work to do on his body, but he has enough power to blow anyone away at this weight. He is a happier fighter, a better fighter and with one more fight I think he will be ready for Huck. I will deliver him that third title shot and I am confident it will be third time lucky...........................................................................I can reveal here that Ricky Burns will return to the ring on June 27 in Glasgow. I am still looking at opponents but I can tell you I am talking to the likes of WBA champion Richar Abril, the WBA champion, and Miguel Vazquez, who holds the IBF belt, and WBC champion Omar Figueroa. I am also looking at the winner of the big domestic fight between Ant Crolla and John Murray next month. I might have wanted to pitch Ricky back in at a slightly lower level after he lost his title against Terence Crawford, but Ricky wants a title and is demanding a big fight. I will give him one. Anthony Joshua will be on the undercard – they love him up there. Back in action: Ricky Bruns will return to the ring on June 27 in Glasgow . In terms of Carl Froch and George Groves, we are getting into the nitty-gritty now. We sold 60,000 tickets in a ridiculous time and I am told that we could have sold 100,000 tickets for this fight. 100,000! My hope now is to sell a further 20,000 a couple of weeks down the line, but first I need to have some discussions with TFL about the curfew times and a few details. I am confident that will be resolved quite quickly and we will end up with 80,000 fans at ringside for what will be the biggest fight in the history of British boxing. Interest: Around 60,000 tickets were sold for Carl Froch's rematch with George Groves inside an hour . Grudge: The Cobra won the first meeting between the pair with a controversial stoppage . Froch-Groves might seem like an easy sell – it’s certainly a lot easier than selling double glazing. When I was about 16, I used to leave college and go straight to a double glazing firm in Romford from 6pm to 8pm every night. I used to have go through the phone book and randomly call everyone I could, trying to get permission for our guys to go round and give them a quote. When you get rejected 99 times out of 100, it makes you realise how tough it can be to sell things. Thankfully, with Froch and Groves we have a product that is a bit easier to shift. I’ll never get complacent because I don’t want to sell windows again!","Kell Brook set to receive an IBF world title shot .

"Dusan Tadic scored the only goal of the game as Southampton beat Manchester United 1-0 at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon. The result means Ronald Koeman's side leapfrog Louis van Gaal's in the Premier League as the Saints move up to third in the table. Robin van Persie was involved in a tetchy exchange with Phil Dowd over a drop-ball restart midway through the first half and responded by shoving the ball rather angrily into the referee’s midriff. Fortunately for the Dutchman, Dowd has a little extra padding in that department and no harm was done. However, the official had little hesitation in booking Van Persie for a challenge on Jose Fonte just before the hour mark.

Southampton gave a debut to Eljero Elia and the 27-year-old Holland winger on loan from Werder Bremen was given a brutal introduction to English football by Chris Smalling who left him in a heap with one lunging challenge in the first half after overrunning the ball close to his own penalty box. This was Southampton’s first victory in the league at Old Trafford in 27 years – a 2-0 win here in January 1988. United had won 16 times since then, drawing three more games, but this was their first defeat.

Tadic’s shirt didn’t stay on for long, however, as he tore it off in celebration after scoring six minutes later and was duly booked by Phil Dowd. Manchester United failed to name a single player youth-team product in their line-up for only the third time since 1937.

There are lots of things for sale, but others are simply great decorations. Books play a central role in the decor; window-shoppers will see animatronic versions of ""The Monster Book of Monsters,"" a tome with teeth, along with self-knitting needles and Harry Potter's snowy owl, Hedwig. With seven shops in Diagon Alley, there's plenty to buy (there are five shops in Hogsmeade, Universal's original Harry Potter attraction, which opened in 2010) from Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasion and, Quality Quidditch Supplies to Scribbulus and Magical Menagerie.

"Click here to read Q&A as it happened . Thursday was 10 years to the day since Arsenal’s Invincibles won the last match in our unbeaten run of 49 games (a 3-1 win at home to Aston Villa). That run included the entire 2003-04 Premier League season when we won the title and received a golden trophy. In my weekly Q&A I described how we did it... I won the Premier League title in 2003/04... and received a golden trophy afterwards! Was this your greatest achievement in football? Nothing beats being first choice. I wasn’t at that stage but recognised the quality of the group and adapted — I was desperate to be involved. It provided a natural end to my career and I had a testimonial at the end. It couldn’t really get any better! When did you realise you were on to something special? It was special the minute Arsene Wenger arrived at the club. He surrounded us with great players and you knew then that we could go and achieve big things. I knew we were on to something special as soon as Arsene Wenger arrived... he truly delivered . Who was the most important player during that run? It was all about the strength of the group. Of course there were obvious stars — Thierry Henry rescued us on more than one occasion. We tried to get those men into positions to win games, but it was all about the group. What was the best victory? The game against Liverpool when we came from behind to win 4-2. We had gone out of the FA Cup (to Manchester United) and the Champions League (to Chelsea) so the side was quite low, but Henry rescued us with an incredible hat-trick. Thierry Henry was superb against Liverpool as we won 4-2 after FA Cup and Champions League exits . But there were several great players who I was lucky to play with . What were Wenger’s tricks? He was a very scientific manager and used to give us sugar lumps at half-time for a quick boost. Some people thought it was just to keep us quiet during his team talks! He also used to not let us have tea or coffee and he banned ketchup, but that caused a bit of a mutiny and we got it back. He even stopped me from having tea and toast the night before a game, which was one of my habits. But I did occasionally sneak a bar of chocolate in. During that period, how much did you dislike Manchester United? I vowed never to hate any opponent — that can be dangerous. You don’t play sport to stop others, you play to win for yourself. There are moments in games when you look for revenge but before the game it wasn’t about that. I vowed never to hate any opponent (even Manchester United), it was too dangerous . Do you think the run will ever be bettered? I think it can be. I feel Chelsea could go unbeaten this season and maybe extend that run. Was it the greatest side of the Premier League era? A team unbeaten for a season has to be the best, although there was always a feeling that we should have won the FA Cup and the Champions League.

Had already won on his international debut for Portugal on the same ground earlier this season  and history repeated itself on Sunday. Brilliant performance from the experienced centre half. Toby Alderweireld - 6 .

The Dutch winger put in a solid display on his  Saints debut before being replaced by Tadic. Eljero Elia put in a solid display on his Southampton debut against Manchester United . James Ward-Prowse - 8 . Done a sterling job limiting the impact of Carrick in the first half in particular. Another good display from the youngster. Graziano Pelle - 7 .

"Chelsea's Under 15 side got a chance to learn from the very best on Monday as Blues captain John Terry took further steps towards a coaching career in the future. Terry, who made his 648th Chelsea appearance in the 2-0 Premier League win against Newcastle last Saturday, took the youngsters for an indoor training session at the club's Cobham training base. The 34-year-old took to Instagram to share several images of the session as Terry revealed he was 'putting in the hours' for his coaching badges. John Terry celebrates after Chelsea's 2-0 Premier League win against Newcastle on Saturday . The Chelsea skipper has been in sparkling form for Jose Mourinho's side so far this season as he looks to earn another one-year contract extension to his current deal before the season is out. Terry also claimed that fans won't be catching him patrolling the touchline in a club tracksuit in the future, revealing he will strictly be a 'shirt and tie manager'. He wrote: 'Putting in the hours for my coaching badges this morning with the U15s. The Chelsea captain was making his 648th appearance in a blue shirt . Kurt Zouma claims he has 'learned a lot' from playing alongside Chelsea stalwart Terry . 'Still a long way to go but enjoying the process. I'm defo a shirt and tie manager'. Chelsea defender Kurt Zouma was full of praise for Terry's leadership skills following his side's win against Newcastle which saw the 20-year-old Frenchman play alongside the former England captain. Zouma told Chelsea's official website: 'Terry helps me a lot when the striker goes behind me or when the striker drops back and I have to follow. Cahill is the same. Tactically, technically and physically I have learned a lot.'

"Jose Mourinho was so exasperated with the officiating of Phil Dowd that he allegedly screamed: ‘You’re too fat to referee.’ The Chelsea manager is said to have launched the astonishing attack against the 51-year-old following defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on New Year’s Day, reports the Mirror. Spurs went on to beat Mourinho’s side 5-3 at White Hart Lane, with the Portuguese flabbergasted at the number of decisions to go against them. Jose Mourinho is said to have berated referee Phil Dowd over his performance in the 5-3 defeat at Tottenham . The Chelsea boss allegedly described Dowd as being 'too fat to referee' and told him he should retire . Andros Townsend scored a penalty after Harry Kane was brought down by Gary Cahill in the area . Spurs went on to beat Mourinho’s side 5-3 at White Hart Lane with Mourinho unhappy at the decisions . ‘You’re too fat to referee, you should retire,’ Mourinho is said to have shouted. ‘You’ve cost us.’ Dowd opted not to award Chelsea a penalty for handball when they were leading early on, an event which Mourinho felt changed the game. The pair are said to have made up after the event, which saw Mourinho allow his emotions to run away with him in the tunnel. But he went on afterwards, claiming Dowd was ‘too slow’ in the post-match press conference. Mourinho has already been slapped with a misconduct charge by the Football Association for claiming there is a ‘campaign’ against the Premier League leaders. Dowd talks to Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas during the Blues' defeat at Tottenham . Dowd attempts to restore order as Chelsea and Tottenham players squabble during the clash . Mourinho has reportedly now made up with Dowd, saying his emotions got the better of him at the time . He has until 6pm on Tuesday to appeal the charge and is set to contest it. The remarks came after the 1-1 draw away at Southampton on December 28 – Mourinho losing control when Anthony Taylor booked Cesc Fabregas for simulation when the midfielder looked as if he’d been tripped. ‘There is a campaign against Chelsea. I don’t know why there is this campaign and I do not care. Everybody knows it was a penalty,’ he said. An FA statement last week read: ‘It is alleged his remarks constitute improper conduct in that they allege and/or imply bias on the part of a referee or referees and/or bring the game into disrepute.’ Mourinho chose not to speak to the media after the weekend win against Newcastle.","Tottenham beat Chelsea 5-3 at White Hart Lane on New Year's Day .

"Hull defender James Chester is facing an indefinite spell on the sidelines after dislocating his shoulder against West Ham on Sunday afternoon. The 25-year-old was forced off for the Tigers in first-half stoppage time, after falling awkwardly on his right shoulder when Hammers defender James Collins beat him to a challenge in the air. Chester, who now requires surgery, looked in some discomfort as he left the field of play, with his shirt fashioned into a sling. James Collins (left) beat James Chester (right) to the ball resulting in the latter dislocating his shoulder . Chester is escorted off the pitch after injuring his shoulder in first-half stoppage time . After the game Hull boss Steve Bruce confirmed the news saying: 'Unfortunately Chester has dislocated his shoulder, we are awaiting x rays. 'It adds to the list of injuries which is unfortunate for us at the minute.' The former Manchester United defender is now the 10th Hull player currently sidelined. The problems continue to mount for Hull boss Steve Bruce after Hull's latest injury setback . Arsenal full-back Mathieu Debuchy suffered a similar injury to Chester when he crashed into the advertising hoardings against Stoke last weekend, consequently being ruled out for three months as a result. Results on the field for Bruce's side aren't any better after goals from Andy Carroll, Morgan Amalfitano and Stewart Downing condemned the Tigers to defeat at Upton Park, meaning they remain in the relegation zone - a point from safety.","James Chester dislocated his shoulder against West Ham on Sunday .

"Jose Mourinho is to contest his FA misconduct charge when he makes a formal submission to the governing body before Tuesday’s 6pm deadline. The Chelsea manager was charged after claiming there is a ‘campaign’ against the Barclays Premier League leaders when they were denied a penalty in the 1-1 draw at Southampton on December 28. Mourinho, who has generally toned down his comments since his return to English football, has the full support of the club in his case. Jose Mourinho was charged by the FA for saying that there was a campaign against Chelsea . Mourinho (right) talks to his support staff after Cesc Fabregas was booked for diving against Southampton . The Chelsea manager can make representations to the FA disciplinary commission by way of mitigation, but it appears he is most likely to highlight his concerns by requesting a personal hearing. It is understood Mourinho will put together video evidence to support his claim that match officials are failing to award his team key decisions in matches. Mourinho lost control at St Mary’s when referee Anthony Taylor booked Cesc Fabregas for simulation when the Spaniard appeared to be fouled by Southampton defender Matt Targett. At the time he said: ‘There is a campaign against Chelsea. I don't know why there is this campaign and I do not care. Everybody knows it was a penalty.’ Cesc Fabregas is shocked after being denied a penalty and is instead booked for simulation . Fabregas appears to be brought down by Southampton's Matt Targett during the match at St Mary's . Since the charge he has taken a vow of silence and refused to speak with the media ahead of Saturday’s 2-0 victory over Newcastle United at Stamford Bridge.

"Chelsea may not be able to claim that Kurt Zouma is a product of their youth set-up, but the French youngster is quickly becoming the next big thing at Stamford Bridge. Zouma, who has only just turned 20, put in another impeccable performance during Chelsea's 2-0 victory against Newcastle on Saturday. For much of the season, the defensive partnership of Gary Cahill and Terry has provided a firm base for a Chelsea side looking to win their first Premier League title since 2010, but that was until the shock 5-3 defeat against rivals Tottenham on New Year's Day. Kurt Zouma has put in a number of impressive performances for Chelsea this season . The French youngster tackles Ayoze Perez during Chelsea's 2-0 win against Newcastle . Zouma marshalled the right side of Chelsea's defence at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . Cahill, in particular, had a game to forget at White Hart Lane and was lucky not to have been shown a red card for a kick on Harry Kane in the second half. The England vice-captain often has to bear the brunt of the criticism from Chelsea fans should the Blues succumb to a defeat and many would have been pleased to see Zouma alongside stalwart Terry at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Strong, quick and confident in possession, Zouma has all the tools to become a star in west London. He's not bad in the opposition's box either, scoring more goals (two) in his first season for Chelsea than much-maligned striker Fernando Torres did during his first term in a blue shirt. Zouma played alongside Chelsea captain John Terry (left) at the heart of the Blues' defence . Zouma scores Chelsea's third goal during the FA Cup third round win against Watford . One thing that cannot be questioned is his bravery on the field. Zouma showed his commitment to the cause during Chelsea's 3-1 Capital One Cup quarter-final win against Derby after being clattered by Petr Cech as the pair attempted to clear a corner. The defender was knocked to the floor from a Derby corner and received treatment for seven minutes as the first half drew to a close. Zouma has now played in Chelsea's last two games and the Blues having conceded a goal, while scoring five at the other end. He made 87 per cent of his passes on Saturday, won three duels and three recoveries. Zouma is clattered by goalkeeper Petr Cech as the Blues No 1 punches the ball clear against Derby . Gary Cahill (left) had a game to forget as Chelsea were beaten 5-3 by Tottenham on New Year's Day . Those at Stamford Bridge on Saturday will also have noticed Terry giving regular instructions to the 20-year-old as the Blues captain looks to mould Zouma into a force to be reckoned with. He's already becoming somewhat of a cult hero in SW6, with fans around the ground chanting his surnames repeatedly. In fact, it was Zouma who looked the more assured defender during a poor first 45 minutes from Terry which saw the former England captain easily beaten by Remy Cabella and Moussa Sissoko as Chelsea struggled to click into gear before an Oscar striker settled the nerves. As Chelsea grew in confidence, so did Zouma, bursting out of defence with the ball on more than one occasion as he looked to drive his team forward. Zouma's chances have been limited this season, the the Frenchman has impressed when selected . Jose Mourinho signed Zouma from St Etienne for a fee of £12.5million last year . Terry may be playing some of the best football of his career this season, but at 34, Mourinho must at least start to think about his eventual replacement. The Portuguese manager may have to look no further than his £12.5million signing should Zouma continue to put in such impressive performances when called upon. On the flipside, Zouma could actually help prolong Terry's career at the heart of the Chelsea defence. Despite Terry's age, the pair still have time to form a perfect partnership in which Zouma's pace and exuberance can dovetial with his skipper's experiences and reading of the game. Chelsea fans have also understandably been quick to mention Marcel Desailly's name when watching Zouma grace the Stamford Bridge turf. Chelsea fans have been comparing the young defender to former club captain Marcel Desailly (right) John Terry (right) learned his trade alongside Desailly and will hope to guide Zouma . The former Blues captain was a commanding presence both on and off the field, and has rightly gone down as one of the Stamford Bridge greats. It would perhaps be unfair to make such early comparisons, but Zouma looks to possess the same leggy gate and similar characteristics to Desailly and is quick to try and make a tackle unlike Cahill who is often guilty of gifting opposing forwards too much space. Assistant coach Steve Holland labelled Zouma's performance as 'immaculate' while Blues boss Mourinho heaped praise on the former St Etienne man following his impressive display against Watford. The 20-year-old celebrates scoring on his Chelsea debut against Bolton in September, 2014 . Mourinho said recently: 'He [Zouma] had another good game . 'He made mistakes in pre-season. But apart from that, his outstanding physical condition and the way he sees the game and makes decision are very good.' Terry admits that learning from the likes of Michael Duberry, Frank Leboeuf and Desailly greatly improved his game and there's no doubt the 34-year-old will be hoping to provide the same inspiration for Chelsea's French starlet.","Kurt Zouma helped Chelsea to 2-0 win against Newcastle on Saturday .

"After more than a decade together, Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings are going out on top, ending their partnership with yet another gold medal. The pair, two of the most recognisable faces in the sport, won their third gold medal yesterday at London’s Horse Guards Parade. Between Athens, Beijing and London, they are undefeated, having won all but one set on the world's top stage. Gold and glory: Misty May-Treanor, left, and Kerri Walsh Jennings, right, pose with their gold medals, their third-straight, following the final in London . Jumping for joy: Walsh Jennings gets some air time as she and May-Treanor celebrate their third gold medal in beach volleyball . Following the match, May-Treanor,35, said she will retire from the sport to spend more time with her husband, Los Angeles Dodgers catcher Matt Treanor, and start a family. She said: 'This is my last match. Beach volleyball's not going to be my career anymore... It's time for me to be a wife. ‘I want to be a mom and share time with my family. All of us as athletes sacrifice more on the family end than people realize. And it's getting back to that. My mind says it's time. My body says it's time. And it's the right time.' Matt Treanor was not in the crowd in London, but that doesn’t mean he  wasn’t watching. Couple: May-Treanor is pictured left with her husband Matt Treanor in 2005 when he was with the Florida Marlins. Treanor now plays for the Los Angeles Dodgers . Before the Dodgers game against the Colorado Rockies in LA yesterday, he anxiously sat in front of a computer in the team's clubhouse to view the action on a weak internet connection that made him miss the final few points. 'I'm just real proud of her,' he said in the Dodger Stadium dugout. 'I am sure she is much more comfortable on the court than I am watching her.' He said that he couldn’t be happier, and admitted that he shed tears of joy as his wife and her longtime teammate won the match against compatriots Jen Kessy and April Ross.

Pre-game celebration: Matt Treanor flashes a thumbs up and is congratulated by teammates after his wife and her partner Kerri Walsh Jennings won gold . ‘Tears didn’t flow right away because there were a bunch of people in the room… To me it’s a swarming effect. There’s all these thoughts and emotions that come into your head and a lot of it is just about Misty. It’s about what she wanted to do and sacrificed and for her to accomplish that.' When asked if she was the best athlete in the family, Treanor said: ‘Yeah, I’ve been saying that for the last eight years.' Walsh Jennings, 33, who lifted herself into the stands to celebrate with her family yesterday, has said she will keep competing, but it is unclear whom she will play with. Rise and fall: May-Treanor appeared on Dancing With the Stars after the Beijing games, but was forced out of the competition after tearing her Achilles . Family in focus: Walsh Jennings had two children after winning their second gold medal in the Beijing games . After winning gold in Beijing in 2008, May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings took some time off. Walsh Jennings, had two children with fellow beach volleyballer Casey Jennings – Joseph and Sundance. May-Treanor competed on Dancing With the Stars, but was forced to drop out of the celebrity dance reality show after tearing her Achilles tendon. She thought she was done with volleyball for good, until a 2010 tournament revealed a hunger for more Olympic gold. Dive: Misty May-Treanor digs out a ball during the gold medal beach volleyball match against Jen Kessy and April Ross . Unbeatable: The team of Walsh Jennings and May-Treanor was the first to win two gold medals in a row, let alone three . She told NBC’s Bob Costas: 'There was this tournament that came about. I played with Kerri - I don’t know if I should’ve been quite out there yet. It was USA vs Brazil [and I was] still playing at a good level after the injury - I was like, ""OK I’ll come back.""' May-Treanor competed with another partner while Walsh Jennings had her second child, but she wished to end the journey with the person she wanted to finish it with, 'and that was Kerri.' But on the road to their third Olympics, the duo realised their relationship had become strained, and they sought professional help. The St Louis Post-Dispatch reported earlier this month that May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings sought couples therapy to bolster their relationship before heading to London.

What followed were several sessions with famed sports psychologist Michael Gervais, who helped them learn how to work better as a team. What transpired was an unstoppable partnership that stunned the world, and even had Ross and Kessy in awe of the Olympic icons. Perfection: Walsh Jennings leaps into the stands as she celebrates . 'I know how hard it is to win one tournament. And the amount of tournaments they've won is crazy,' said Kessy, who took the silver with Ross in their Olympic debuts.

"Former Everton ace Tim Cahill and Crystal Palace captain Mile Jedinak led Australia in their final training session ahead of the 2015 Asian Cup opener against Kuwait in Melbourne. Rejuvenating an ageing squad has been Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou's primary focus since taking charge  but his greatest asset remains his oldest player, Cahill. The New York Red Bulls attacking midfielder stands out in a crowd of relative unknowns on the international stage and his influence on the squad and their results is undoubted. Australia captain Mile Jedinak (left) and Tim Cahill stretch out as the Asian Cup hosts prepare for their opener . Cahill, at 35, remains Australia's most dangerous player having scored seven of their 11 goals in 2014 . (From left) Former Serie A star Mark Bresciano, Cahill and Jedinak are the old heads for the Socceroos . Cahill scored seven of the 11 goals Australia managed in 2014, including two at the World Cup in Brazil where they won many admirers despite losing group matches to Spain, Holland and Chile. The 76-cap veteran also delivered a goal of the year contender with his incredible left-footed volley in the 3-2 defeat by the Dutch which took his tally in World Cups to five - the same total as Lionel Messi, Zinedine Zidane and Luis Suarez. A buoyant figure within the camp, Cahill was often laughing during their session on Thursday and says he's enjoying his football as much as ever ahead of what is likely to be his international swansong. It's also the second favourites' best chance of claiming their first major tournament triumph having been beaten by Japan in extra-time in the final four years ago. 'I feel great. This is a big tournament and I really want to do well in it. I still love the game. I love it the same way I did when I first started playing at Millwall as a 16-year-old,' Cahill told the ABC's Francis Leach. Crystal Palace will miss Jedinak (No 15) as the Socceroos captain leads his country on home turf . Bayer Leverkusen's Robbie Kruse (front) will be another danger man for the Aussies, along with Cahill . Crystal Palace and Aussie captain Jedinak is the only Socceroo plying his trade as a regular starter in one of Europe's top leagues, with Leicester's newly signed 42-year-old keeper Mark Schwarzer retired from internationals. Mark Bresciano, the former Serie A journeyman now playing in Qatar Stars League, is just one year Cahill's junior and a frontrunner to be deployed as one of two No 10's behind a lone striker alongside Tommy Oar (FC Utrecht), Massimo Luongo (Swindon Town) or James Troisi (Zulte Waregem). Postecoglou's line-up will be an attacking one prepared to be frustrated by a defensive-minded Kuwait side that will sit back and look to catch their more fancied opponents on the break. Other weapons at the  former Brisbane Roar manager's disposal include Robbie Kruse, who is on the books at Bayer Leverkusen but is goalless this season in six appearances, mostly off the bench, and powerful Matthew Leckie from Bundesliga 2's FC Ingolstadt 04. Australia players prepare to kick off the 2015 Asian Cup in Melbourne on Friday against Kuwait . Coach Ange Postecoglou (3rd from right) leads the final run on Melbourne Rectangular Stadium on Thursday . Cahill's laughing now but stresses the importance of the tournament for football in Australia is massive . Club Brugge's Matt Ryan is Postecoglou's preferred keeper, edging out Mitchell Langerak who's played seven times this campaign for Borussia Dortmund, behind a possible back four of Ivan Franjic (Torpedo Moscow), Alex Wilkinson (Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors, South Korea), Matthew Spiranovic (Western Sydney Wanderers) and Aziz Behich, who's signed to Turkey's Bursaspor but back at Melbourne City on loan. In a tough pool that also includes third favourites for the tournament South Korea and Oman, Cahill's ability to manufacture a goal from very little will be a key for the hosts. And the front man will be doing all he can to leave a lasting mark on the game in his home country where football battles rugby league, AFL and rugby union for attention.

"She has faced her fair share of scrutiny in her five years as a designer. And Victoria Beckham, who is finally being embraced by the fashion world, reveals she will showcase a flawless range of tailored separates at New York Fashion Week today. The fashion designer, 39, famed for her fitted pencil dresses, says she will be unveiling a 'paparazzi-proof' collection that is designed to flatter from every angle. Victoria, pictured last month, wears coat, trousers, blouse, and bag from Victoria Beckham Pre-AW14 range . Her 'long and lean' FW14 offering will feature sweeping long coats with pleated inserts and tuxedo-style gilets cut low at the back - to ensure you look as good leaving as you do arriving. Victoria says she spent a lot of time making sure the leg-lengthening trousers were 'cut correctly, to really get as long and lean a leg as physically possible.' 'No one is going to say no to a nice long leg,' she said at an exclusive preview for The Sunday Times. A striking pair of tomato red skinny trousers, which gather lightly at the ankle and fall halfway down the foot when wearing a high-heel, create a clever leg-lengthening illusion. Victoria says she has layered cashmere vests under evening dresses this season to 'make the red-carpet looks feel really cool'. When she first appeared on the fashion scene, Victoria focussed very much on form-fitting dresses, but as of SS14's amazing display of very wearable separates, she's now tapping into a whole new market - and wardrobe. Amazing at designing well-tailored pieces, she wears them well too, so this new collection promises to showcase some standout structure. The fashionista knows how to do a good coat, too: From her long-line blazers, to her half-ponyskin delights from AW13. The fashion world is waiting with baited breath to see what she has to offer for this winter. Her runway show, part of the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week New York, is scheduled for 10am (3pm GMT), off-site at Café Rouge, 145 West 32nd Street. Husband David Beckham is expected to attend. In late 2013, Victoria unveiled her ICON (L) polo shift dress, £1,650 (R) cap sleeve v neck fitted dress, £1,050 . Mother-of-four Victoria, who once said she 'couldn't concentrate in flats' and 'beyond hated' ballet shoes, will spend this week, one of the busiest in the . fashion calendar, in flat shoes. She revealed she has gave up her high-heel addiction in the run up to New York fashion week in favour of a pair of Stubbs & Wootton velvet slippers after sharing a picture with her Twitter and Instagram followers. Meanwhile, husband David announced on Wednesday that he is setting up a new Major League Soccer club in Miami. The Beckhams, who moved back to London after David left LA Galaxy in 2012, are now looking forward to spending time in the Florida city. The former footballer - who retired as a player in May 2013 - said his wife and four children, Brooklyn, 14, Romeo, 11, Cruz, eight, and Harper, two, are excited about exploring the city. A Beckham family spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Victoria and the children are thrilled by this next adventure in their life story, as a family they love America and are all very excited to explore a new city and spend time in beautiful Miami.' Victoria's first London boutique opens in the autumn. Victoria Beckham showed her SS14 collection - a heady combination of white, fuchsia and burgundy at New York Fashion Week in September - in stark contrast to the cool, minimalist offering promised for this PM .","FW14 catwalk show at NYFW scheduled for 10am (3pm GMT)

"Arsenal’s interest in Virgil van Dijk will have heightened further after the Celtic defender indicated he must talk to Premier League clubs if they bid for him this month. The Holland Under 21 international looks as if will head south from Glasgow at the end of the season but is open to offers in January. While he insists that Celtic’s refusal to let him leave unless major money comes their way is no problem for now, Van Dijk pointed at his age as reason to move on. Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk (centre) has opened the door to a move to the Premier League . The Dutch defender believes that Celtic are holding out in hope of receiving a large transfer fee for him . ‘I have recently been thinking a bit about it [his career],’ Van Dijk told De Telegraaf. ‘I am now 23 and have played at Willem II, FC Groningen and Celtic and am now linked to clubs like Arsenal. Isn’t that great? ‘There are a lot of clubs interested, but Celtic is holding on to a big transfer fee. The club is clear: they don’t want to let me go in the winter, because we’re playing for four trophies. ‘I understand the point of view from the club and I see it as a compliment that they don’t want to let me go. But we have to be realistic. Van Dijk (right) challenges Neymar (left) in a Champions League clash with Barcelona in 2013 . ‘If there’s a nice club from England, we have to talk.

"Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre has left the door open for Steven Gerrard to return on loan once he moves to Los Angeles Galaxy. The Reds captain will end his 25-year-long association with his boyhood club this summer when he departs for a new challenge in Major League Soccer. Principal owner John Henry and manager Brendan Rodgers have both said there will always be a role for the midfielder at the club whenever he decides to return from America, but Ayre has not ruled out the possibility of the 34-year-old pulling on the red shirt again. Steven Gerrard (centre) could return to Liverpool on loan, according to chief executive Ian Ayre . Ayre believes that even though Gerrard will leave Liverpool, he will always be allowed to return to the club . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has said Gerrard will always be welcome at the club . 'I've said openly to Steven and his representatives, as have Brendan and the owners, that we see Steven as part of the family,' he told Liverpool radio station CityTalk. 'The fact that he's leaving at the end of the season doesn't mean it's the last we'll see of him at Liverpool. 'What that means, the details aren't known yet, but we will keep a regular dialogue with him and I hope we will see him here again in the long term.' Asked if that could mean a return on loan next January, Ayre said: 'It's conceivable. It happens a lot in MLS, and it's something we talked to Steven and his representatives about. 'You can't have someone who has so much of the club's DNA in them and just expect that it will go away.' Last week Rodgers drew a line under the debate over Gerrard's contract after the player said he would have signed a new deal had it been offered last summer. Liverpool's approach did not arrive until November, by which time Gerrard was already considering other options having been told by Rodgers his playing time would be managed as the oldest member of the squad. Ayre insists the timing of a 'substantial' contract offer would not have made a difference. Ayre said even if Liverpool had offered Gerrard a new deal earlier, he still would have questioned his future . Gerrard decided to bring his Liverpool career to an end after being told his games would be managed . 'Let's assume that we'd made that offer (in the summer) and that he'd signed it. I think we'd still be in the same position today,' he added. 'Just like any player, at any club, if he all of a sudden isn't playing every week, they maybe start to think 'Maybe this isn't the place for me now'. 'Steven may have signed that contract but we may have been sat round now in the same position. 'We've had that before with very senior players. I had one come to me and say 'I don't really fancy this any more'. 'Who knows how it would have played out? But I think Steven made the point last week that it (not playing every week) doesn't appeal to him. Gerrard has said that he wants to leave Liverpool by winning a trophy and finishing in the top four . 'So the fact that he would have signed a contract last season actually doesn't make any difference. 'His point was that after playing every week, playing a bit-part role is not how he wanted to finish his career. 'He wants to finish on a high and I am sure he will.'","Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre insists Steven Gerrard will be back .

"Tottenham are keen to sign West Ham defender Winston Reid – but will not bid for him in this transfer window. Spurs are understood to be willing to meet Reid’s wage demands of £60,000-a-week wages. Reid is set to leave West Ham in the summer on a free transfer and has been linked with a number of top Premier League clubs. Tottenham have entered the race to sign West Ham's  Winston Reid, who is out of contract this summer . Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has been linked with a move for Reid in this transfer window. And Chelsea have also been sounded out, as have Everton but Reid is believed to have his heart set on a move to a top six club.

"With every new bit of transfer speculation about a Southampton player I’ve been trying to stay positive. ‘At least no club demands such consistently high transfer fees for their players,’ I’ve been telling myself. ‘Lots of good players remain.’ But with first Mauricio Pochettino’s departure to manage Spurs, and then Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, and Luke Shaw gone, now Calum Chambers and Dejan Lovren almost out the door, and possibly Morgan Schneiderlin, Jose Fonte and Jay Rodriguez to follow (like most Saints fans I’m ignoring the impact of Dani Osvaldo leaving) - my patience and confidence is sapping. VIDEO Scroll down to watch departures Rickie Lambert and Luke Shaw at their new clubs . Big-money move: Calum Chambers is set to leave Southampton for Arsenal this summer .

Switch: Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert left Southampton for Liverpool following an impressive season . Red Devil: Talented left-back Luke Shaw joined Manchester United from Southampton in a £30million deal . If anything Saints performed too well last year - not just finishing unexpectedly high up the table, but playing attractive football to boot. Six players went to the World Cup. It was a season that left Saints fans full of optimism. Now we’ve gone back ten paces. In the Premier League where small margins separate mid-table teams from relegated ones - that could be critical. Everyone’s looking for someone to blame. Is it the all those involved in the departure of Nicola Cortese  - the chief executive who left halfway through last season? Certainly many things seem to have stemmed from that moment. Or Pochettino’s for bailing as soon as he got an offer from a more fashionable club? I can’t blame the players for being ambitious - least of all Lambert for wanting to finish his career at his hometown club. And no matter how resilient the board, they can’t keep hold of players who no longer want to be there. But you can hold the board responsible for failing to inspire the squad with confidence. If there had been a clear plan and signs of ambition - as in the past five years - then surely many would have stayed. Man at the helm: Mauricio Pochettino left St Mary's this summer to take charge of league rivals Tottenham . Floored: New Southampton striker Graziano Pelle looks on during the Saints' friendly win over Swindon . This is a board that promised transparency and open-ness, so where is the message to fans that behind the scenes the club is signing players? We could have a £100 million plus war chest, what is being done with that? New manager Ronald Koeman has so far signed two players, but how good will they be? Ask most Saints fans I know, what they do when we sign a player and the answer is: “Look on Youtube to find out who they are”. The club has a good recent history of signing players - that is, at least, another reason for hope - but it takes time to build a squad. The flying start of last season is a distant memory already. At this rate, the first league game against Liverpool in three week’s time is going to come far too quickly.","Moneymail Editor and St Mary's regular James Coney asesses the situation at Southampton .

"In January 2003 Swansea City were five points adrift at the bottom of the Football League, fast forward 12 years and they've sold their star striker Wilfried Bony to the Premier League champions for £25million - rising to £28m depending on his success on leaving the Liberty Stadium. The Welsh club's meteoric rise has seen them move from the brink of the amateur game to mixing with some of Europe's finest sides in the Europa League. From their days in League Two to their League Cup success, Sportsmail takes a look back at the Swans' remarkable journey. Vetch Field was Swansea's ground from 1912 until they moved to the Liberty Stadium in 2005 . A view of the North Bank entrance to the old stadium before they moved almost 10 years ago . 2002-03 . Managers: Nick Cusack, Brian Flynn . Finished: 21st in Third Division . By mid-January 2003, Swansea were five points behind Carlisle United at the bottom of the Third Division (now League Two) after a run of six successive defeats. Non-League football beckoned. Their quest for safety went down to the final day of the season when a 4-2 victory at home to Hull lifted them one point ahead of the relegation zone and began a remarkable rise to the top of English football. 2003-04 . Managers: Brian Flynn, Alan Curtis, Kenny Jackett . Finished: 10th in Third Division . The following campaign started brightly for the Swans, but with the play-offs and possible promotion on the horizon the club fell victim to a woeful run of results. They suffered six defeats in their last eight matches, eventually leaving them 10th in the table. Roberto Martinez played for Swansea between 2003-06 and later went on to manage the club from 2007-09 . Leon Britton and Adebayo Akinfenwa playing for Swansea back in January 2006 . 2004-05 . Manager: Kenny Jackett . Finished: Third in League Two . The club's final season at Vetch Field, the stadium they had occupied since 1912, brought their first trophy in four years. Swansea won the FAW Premier Cup and, but for two defeats in their last five matches, could have finished the season as champions. They eventually finished third, three points behind first-placed Yeovil Town. 2005-06 . Manager: Kenny Jackett . Finished: Sixth in League One . The Liberty Stadium opened in the summer of 2005 and with it came another impressive season. Another FAW Premier Cup success was followed by a stellar first season in League One. After a considerable amount of time spent at the top of the table, the Swans were once again let down by some disappointing late-season form. After winning just five of 20 league matches in the second half of the campaign, Swansea  finished sixth. Defeat to Barnsley in the play-offs ensured another season in England's third tier. There was some consolation for the club's supporters, though, after they triumphed in the Football League Trophy. Swansea narrowly missed out on promotion to the Championship in 2006 but did taste success elsewhere . Akinfenwa (right) and Lee Trundle lift the Football League Trophy after success in 2006 . 2006-07 . Manager: Kenny Jackett . Finished: Seventh in League One . The following season saw, at last, a level of consistency from Swansea, and they were unlucky to miss out on a play-off place in May. They finished seventh in the table after a 6-3 defeat at home by Blackpool on the final day of the season. 2007-08 . Managers: Kenny Jackett, Kevin Nugent, Roberto Martinez . Finished: League One winners . It was a case of third time lucky for Swansea as they finally earned promotion to the Championship in 2008. Jason Scotland scored 24 goals as they ran away with the title, finishing 10 points clear of second-placed Nottingham Forest. Garry Monk played for Swansea between 2004-12 and became their manager in 2014 . Swansea players celebrate after beating Portsmouth in the FA Cup back in January 2009 . 2008-09 . Manager: Roberto Martinez . Finished: Eighth in the Championship . Scotland impressed again for the Swans in what would be his final season with the Welshmen. His 21 goals helped them finish eighth in the Championship and earned him a £2m move to Wigan - breaking the record for Swansea's largest ever transfer fee received. 2009-10 . Manager: Paulo Sousa . Finished: Seventh in the Championship . Despite selling their star striker, Sousa guided Swansea to a seventh-placed finish in the Championship, missing out on the play-offs by just one point. In the absence Scotland's efforts up front, it was their defence that really excelled. They ended the season having conceded just 12 goals at home - fewer than any other team in the league. Britton (left) and Mark Gower (right) celebrate after winning promotion from the Championship in 2011 . Then-Swansea manager Brendan Rodgers with the play-off trophy back in 2011 . 2010-11 . Manager: Brendan Rodgers . Finished: Third in the Championship . After Cardiff's numerous near-misses, Swansea became the first Welsh club to win promotion to the Premier League. City finished third in the Championship and then won promotion through the play-offs. They beat Nottingham Forest in the semi-finals before Scott Sinclair scored a hat-trick against Reading in the final to complete their journey from the bottom to the top of professional football. 2011-12 . Manager: Brendan Rodgers . Finished: 11th in the Premier League . After a difficult start that saw Swansea fail to win any of their four opening fixtures in the Premier League, they established themselves as a formidable force. They paid a club-record £3.5m for Danny Graham, who slotted seamlessly into the side, scoring 14 goals in all competitions. Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool all fell victim to Rodgers' impressive, tactically astute side, who finished 11th in the table. Gylfi Sigurdsson enjoyed two successful spells at the Welsh club, first on loan, then as a permanent player . Swansea have had numerous successes against the Premier League's big teams, including Arsenal . 2012-13 . Manager: Michael Laudrup . Finished: Ninth in the Premier League . Rodgers' departure to Liverpool left many suggesting Swansea were destined for relegation, but the club again proved their doubters wrong and achieved arguably the greatest success in their history. The club also sold star players Sinclair and Joe Allen to Manchester city and Liverpool respectively for a combined £23m. But Michu took the Premier League by storm, scoring 18 goals as Michael Laudrup guided the club to a top-half finish. They also won the League Cup, beating Bradford City 5-0 in the final and booking their place in the Europa League. 2013-14 . Managers: Michael Laudrup, Garry Monk . Finished: 12th in the Premier League . The club reinvested the money received the previous season as they splashed out a club-record£12m for Ivorian Wilfried Bony. But Swansea's European commitments took a toll on the club and indifferent form saw them just two points off the relegation places in February. Laudrup was removed as manager and Garry Monk took over. Monk brought stability to the side and they finished 12th in the table. 2014-15 . Manager: Garry Monk . Monk started the season strongly, beating Manchester United 2-1 in their opening game. The club received a record fee of £25m (rising to £28m) for star-striker Bony in January as the Ivorian moved to champions Manchester City.

"A grandfather who suffered a massive heart attack on a bus has told how he was saved by a Good Samaritan - who performed CPR on him while singing Bee Gees classic ‘Stayin’ Alive’. Retired taxi boss Terry Holly, 67, slumped to the floor of the double-decker bus in front of horrified passengers as he headed home from seeing his ex-wife. Sharon Thorneywork realised the father-of-three’s heart had failed and remembered a TV advert telling viewers to administer CPR by pumping the chest in time to the Bee Gees’ song. Terry Holly's life was saved by Sharon Thorneywork when he had a heart attack on a bus in Birmingham. Ms Thorneywork performed CPR for 18 minutes until paramedics arrived . In the British Heart Foundation commercial, football hard-man Vinnie Jones demonstrates proper heart massage technique - keeping the correct rhythm by singing the 70s classic. Administration officer Ms Thorneywork, who works at Birmingham Children’s Hospital, pumped Mr Holly’s heart for a staggering 18 minutes until paramedics arrived - singing the words to the song as she did so. She was only on the 67 bus, bound from the Erdington area of Birmingham to the city centre, by chance, because one of her children was ill so she was running late. The mother-of-three, 42, was sitting in front of Mr Holly on the bus when she noticed him fall over. She said: ‘We came up to a bus stop and in the corner of my eye I saw Terry fall. ‘I thought he had just lost his balance but I turned around and he was lying with his back to me in the foot well of the seats behind. Ms Thorneywork sprang into action when she noticed Mr Holly slump into the foot well behind her seat and start to turn blue . ‘I asked him “are you alright” and “can you hear me” but he was going quite blue and he wasn’t breathing properly. ‘I turned him over and began feeling for his pulse, but I couldn’t find one and he was getting more and more blue. ‘At that point I started pumping his chest, I knew how to do CPR from being in St John’s Ambulance when I was younger but it was the Bee Gees that helped me keep the rhythm. ‘I was singing “Stayin’ Alive” in my head the whole time to keep the rhythm going. ‘In a situation like that I think you go into auto-pilot, I wasn’t aware of what was going on around me, I just knew how to do chest compressions and was singing the Bee Gees to myself. She knew how to perform hands-only CPR in time to the Bee Gees' classic, 'Stayin' Alive', because she had seen the British Heart Foundation's advertisement featuring Vinnie Jones (pictured) ‘The whole thing lasted 18 minutes, including the time the paramedics were I know because I checked the clock. ‘One paramedic who was first on the scene asked me to carry on chest compressions when he arrived while he performed checks. ‘I even helped them carry Terry out of the bus.’ Mr Holly, from Bristol, had been to visit his ex-wife who he is still friends with, in Birmingham on February 25 when he collapsed on the way home. She sang the song out loud as she performed CPR and says that she just went into 'auto-pilot' and was not aware of what was going on around her . Yesterday he was reunited with Ms Thorneywork, along with two paramedics who helped save his life. He said: ‘I don’t remember too much of the actual incident, everything up to getting on the bus is a bit of a blur. ‘But when people told me that a woman had saved my life by following the instructions in a TV advert I was stunned. Mr Holly has thanked Ms Thorneywork, and the paramedics, for saving his life . ‘Apparently she was singing along to “Stayin’ Alive” as she pumped my chest. ‘It must have been an odd sight but it saved my life and I will always be very grateful to her. ‘I understand Sharon was pumping my heart for 18 minutes - so it must have been the extended remix going around her head. ‘The remarkable thing is Sharon doesn’t usually get that bus, she was only on it that day because her child was ill and she was running late. ‘I’m like the cat with nine lives, I feel so lucky. ‘I can’t thank her enough, I think she should sing it from the rooftops.’ Doireann Maddock, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘We know hands-only CPR has saved lives in supermarkets, pubs and on golf courses, but this is the first time we know of that it’s made a life-saving difference on public transport. ‘Sharon did exactly the right thing and kept pushing hard and fast to the beat of “Stayin’ Alive” by the Bee Gees until professional help arrived. ‘It’s vitally important you keep up chest compressions until paramedics get to the scene - no matter how long that might be. ‘Sharon is one of more than 35 people who has given hands-only CPR a go and helped save a life. No matter where you are, it can be the difference between life and death for anyone in cardiac arrest.’","Terry Holly, 67, had a massive heart attack while on a bus in Birmingham .

"Bullied and bruised: Brian Hudkins, 60,  was reporting a suspected burglary when Officer T. Michael Wilson threw him to the ground and arrested him instead, unprovoked . An 'Officer of the Year' for the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department is now under investigation after security footage was released showing him attacking a 60-year-old man who was just reporting a burglary. Last September, victim Brian Hudkins was in town for a business conference. He was staying at the JW Marriott in Indianapolis with one of his employees, Andrew Davis. After dinner, the two went back to the hotel, but Davis was locked out of his room. He heard people behind the door and called Hudkins, believing it was a burglary. The two went downstairs to report the incident to hotel management and asked that they call the police. Officer . T. Michael Wilson responded to the call, and his exchange with the two men was recorded on hotel security camera footage obtained by WISH. After only 16 seconds . speaking to the two men, Officer Wilson tackled Mr Hudkins to the ground. Wilson . wrote in his report that Mr Hudkins was told to 'quiet' down and refused. The officer said he 'attempted to push Mr Hudkins backwards and away from the situation' but the man 'forcibly' pushed backwards. The surveillance footage shows quite a different story. Mr Hudkins couldn't possibly push back as his hands were behind his back the entire time. Officer Wilson not only pushes him to the ground once, but once arrested he pushes him to the ground again on the way out to the squad car. As for Mr Davis, he began to take footage on his camera and Officer Wilson told him to get on the ground as well or else he would taze him. Casual conversation: Officer T. Michael Wilson, left, speaks with Brian Hudkins (beige shirt) and Andrew Davis (blue shirt) about a suspected burglary in one of their rooms . Unprovoked: In his report, Officer Wilson said Mr Hudkins pushed him back - but the video shows the 60-year-old with his hands behind his back the entire time . On the ground: Officer Wilson pushes the man to the ground, to arrest him though even when he doesn't show resistance . Down again: Mr Hudkins is pushed to the ground again on the way to the squad car. He says it took him weeks to recover from the lacerations to his face . The two men spent the night in jail. Mr Hudkins missed most of the conference and it took him weeks to heal from he multiple lacerations on his face incurred in the attack. Officer Wilson was named 'Community Policing Support Officer of the Year' five months later in May. WISH showed the video to Police Chief Rick Hite, who said he had never seen the video before. The station later found out it was sent to the department five months ago. Hite promised to immediately start an internal investigation into the incident and the officer's behavior. 'I'm nor denying what we saw or what we've seen but we have a policy and a process in which we adjudicate each and every investigation,' he said. Since the incident, Hudkins has filed a lawsuit asking for $700,000 in damages. He says that he was forced to give a guilty plea the night he was arrested to get the charges off his record. They also made him promise to stay away from the hotel and donate $500 to a police charity.","Officer T.

"A dart game that used President Obama's face for target practice at a county fair in New York state is being dismantled today. Fairgoer Abigail Czapsky submitted photos of the booth at Otsego County Fair to HuffPost yesterday, which show President Obama's face lined up alongside yellow stars in a dart game. According to Czapsky's Facebook page, following yesterday's HuffPost story the booth has now taken down the offensive targets. Outrage: This is the target of President Obama used at a New York State fair over the weekend . Target: Fairgoers were offended by the use of an image of the President's face as a target in a fairground game . Czapsky says the Otsego County Fair Board called her to apologize about the booth and explain that it was being taken down. 'Not one . individual on the fair board, apparently, took issue with the game in . any review that was done before the actual opening of the midway,' writes Czapsky. 'The . quote was they ""just missed it"" at the time but would now be taking it . down.' It is unclear what the prize was for fairgoers who managed a bulls-eye on Obama. It's not the first time the President's face has been used for fairground amusements. In 2010, a Pennsylvania amusement company was forced to dismantle a game in which players shot foam darts at a likeness of President Obama's face. Apologetic: Organizers of the Otsego County Fair have apologized for the disrespectful game and are removing the offending images today . At the time company head Irvin Good, Jr, told Associated Press, 'It was just a big, big mistake in judgment, and I feel sorry about it. I can't take it back, but I can try to make it better.' Kathryn Chapman, the fairgoer who complained about the game, dubbed Alien Attack and featuring a painted image of a black man wearing a belt buckle with the Presidential seal and holding a scroll labeled 'Health Bill', was offended by its inferences. Players stood to win prizes such as stuffed animals by hitting targets on the image's head and heart. 'What is the message you are sending kids, that if your views don't agree with somebody else's, shoot them? I just found it incredibly disrespectful and violent,' Chapman told HuffPost. 'And this was the president, the highest office in the country. It was absolutely appalling.'","A fairgoer at Otsego County Fair photographed an offensive game that used the President's face as a target .

"Beachfront homeowners in the exclusive L.A. neighborhood of Malibu are up in arms about a new smartphone app which provides anyone using it with evaluable information about how to get to the area’s hard to reach public beaches. Environmental writer Jenny Price passionately believes that everyone deserves access to the area's public beaches but with 20 of Malibu's 27 miles of coastline lined with private developments trying to access the beaches has long been a complicated business. Homeowners in Malibu - include some of the wealthiest and most famous people in the country – have long used a variety of means to keep the beaches to themselves including padlocks, gates, menacing signs, security guards and lawsuits. Environmental writer Jenny Price passionately believes that everyone deserves access to Malibu's public beaches . Gaining access to Malibu's public beaches has long been a complicated business as much of the coastline is lined with private developments . Price decided to get together with tech developers EscapeApps to create an app for smartphones which provides users with all the necessary tips and information on how to reach the hard to find beauty spots. The ‘Our Malibu Beaches’ app claims to give users ‘pinpointed directions and expert tips so you can enjoy the 20 miles of gorgeous beaches in Malibu that are lined with private development’. It includes info on how to find the elusive access-ways, where you're free to walk and put your towel and which fake 'No Trespassing' and 'No Parking' signs you can legally ignore. The release of the app has set off waves of anxiety among local homeowners, fearful that this summer they will be descended upon by hordes of people. Using the funding website Kickerstarter, Price raised over $30,000 needed to build the app . An iPhone version is currently available for free, while an Android version is expected in the fall . Locals complain that the remote and often small beaches simply don’t have enough amenities - such as bathrooms and parking - to accommodate large influxes of sun-seekers. ‘People come through, they urinate, defecate, they leave their garbage - there are no garbage pails. They can’t park; there is no parking, so they block driveways,' one local told the New York Times. But local homeowners have also been known to use underhand means to keep people out. Parking is a serious problem and homeowners are known to drop orange cones on the street or build fake garage doors to block off legal parking spots. The app includes info on how to find the elusive access-ways, where you're free to walk and put your towel and which fake 'No Trespassing' and 'No Parking' signs you can legally ignore . Some owners plant hedges to obscure beach access gates, while other gates are often weighted down with numerous signs, some legitimate, some that can be bought at Home Depot for $10, said Price. Using the funding website Kickerstarter, Price raised over $30,000 needed to build the app. An iPhone version is currently available for free, while an Android version is expected in the fall costing $1.99. Malibu is home to stars including Pierce Brosnan and major Hollywood producers including David Geffen, Michael D. Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg, but Price claims she isn’t interested in class warfare. 'It’s not about who lives down here. It’s not a take-down-the-billionaires project. This is not a political statement,' she told The New York Times. Instead she believes public spaces should be open to all.

"The canine sidekick of a police officer shot to death in the line of duty gave a heart wrenching goodbye to his fallen partner Thursday, standing vigil at the funeral just before the casket was lowered into the ground. It was a deeply emotional funeral for Bardstown, Kentucky police officer Jason Ellis, 33, who was murdered on a highway exit ramp May 25 in what police believe was a planned setup to lure the officer from the safety of his car. His canine partner, Figo, stood beside his casket at Highview Cemetery in Chaplin, Kentucky and a touching photo shows the dog placing a loving paw on Ellis casket, as if giving his last goodbye. Heartbreaking: K9 officer Figo placed a paw on the casket of his fallen partner Jason Ellis Thursday. Ellis, a Bardstown, Kentucky police officer was killed in the line of duty after, police say, he was ambushed on a highway ramp . Targeted: Husband and father of two, Ellis, 33, was a minor league baseball player turned drug enforcement officer. He was killed with multiple gunshot blasts May 25 after what police say was a planned ambush . Figo has been retired and given to Ellis’ widow, Amy, and his two sons, ages 6 and 7. Last week, Amy spoke of the agony of sharing the news of his death with her two sons, who idolized their father. 'He wanted to make sure everybody was having a good time around him. He was a dedicated family man. He loved our boys. He loved me,' she said. 'I've laid on the bathroom floor.  I did not want to live another second without him.  I don't have the strength to pray right now, but I know that many others are praying for me and our family. 'Now I know I have to be strong for our kids.' At . Thursday's funeral, Police Chief Rick McCubbin said Ellis ‘paid the . ultimate sacrifice doing what he loved, being a police officer.’ He . called Ellis and Figo ‘true partners.’ The . former minor league baseball player turned lawman was hit with multiple . shotgun blasts early Saturday after he got out his cruiser to pick up . debris at a ramp off the Bluegrass Parkway in Nelson County, according . to Kentucky State Police. The investigation is continuing. Hundreds . of police officers from Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana, emergency workers . and others attended services for Ellis, a K-9 officer who was on the . drug task force. ‘Heaven . is a real place. Jason is there,’ said the Rev. Brent Snook of First . Baptist Church of Glen Este, in Batavia, Ohio, who had been Ellis’ childhood pastor. Ellis’ flag-draped coffin was pulled on a caisson by one white horse. It was accompanied by five officers on horseback and one officer leading a riderless horse. A bagpipe and drummer played. Saluted: Fellow officers gathered from multiple states to attend the June 2013 funeral for Bardstown, Kentucky officer Jason Ellis, whose murder remains unsolved . Emotional tribute: Bardstown Chief of Police Rick McCubbin, right, spoke at Ellis's May 30 funeral where he called Ellis and Figo 'true partners.' At right, a Kentucky State Trooper pays his respects at the well-attended ceremony . At the end of the burial service, two helicopters flew overhead and the bagpipe player played ‘Amazing Grace.’ At the morning service at Parkway Baptist Church in Bardstown, McCubbin told mourners Ellis was a fun-loving jokester who dressed as an elf at a town Christmas party, and he was proud of his work taking drugs off the streets with Figo. Ellis was ‘gunned down in a senseless act of cowardice and you just want to cry out, ‘Why?’ Snook said at the funeral service. Later, as the funeral procession inched slowly toward the cemetery 18 miles away, young and old stood on the roadside in this town of 12,000 and watched. Factories, office buildings and offices emptied as people lined the streets, many clutching American flags or holding their hands on their hearts. Senseless: Hundreds of officers attended the funeral, including this Kentucky State Trooper, for Ellis who was slayed in a 'senseless act of cowardice' Others held signs thanking Ellis for his service. A giant American flag hung between two fire-truck ladders in front of the police department. Outside the courthouse stood three judges in black robes. Outside the police station in Bardstown, about 40 miles southeast of Louisville, a makeshift memorial featuring flags, candles, flowers and baseballs sat in front of a police cruiser signed with messages. One message read: ‘I love you. Mom.’ Officials on Thursday announced that a reward fund in the case has surpassed $100,000. Ellis had been a standout baseball player at the University of the Cumberlands, and he went on to play minor league ball in the Cincinnati Reds system from 2002 to 2005. Shocking: Officers, friends, and family gather for the funeral service of Officer Jason Ellis, the first ever killed in the line of duty in Bardstown, Kentucky, a town of 12,000 .

"President Barack Obama is enjoying strong support for his NSA's surveillance program from Democratic partisans. Polls conducted in 2006 and 2013 show a 27 per cent opinion swing among voters in Obama's party . A poll conducted after news of the NSA's snooping scandal broke on Thursday shows that more than one quarter of self-identified Democrats disapproved of the agency's surveillance programs under the George W. Bush administration, but now approve of it under the stewardship of Barack Obama. The national survey from the Pew Research Center and The Washington Post found that 64 per cent of Democrats approve of the NSA 'getting secret court orders to track calls of millions of Americans to investigate terrorism.' Only 34 per cent voiced disapproval. When Pew asked a similar question in 2006, just 37 per cent found the practice of 'secretly listening in on phone calls and reading emails without court approval' acceptable. That partisan swing of 27 per cent . may be related to the differences in the questions' wording, but it . suggests an overall willingness on the part of President Obama's . partisan supporters to approve of the NSA's secret surveillance now that . his administration is in charge. Republicans, . too, saw a shift in support for the NSA's programs - only in the . opposite direction. Support from 75 per cent of GOP supporters in 2006 . dwindled to 52 per cent this month. The political left and right are closer in their opinions of whether NSA is justified in 'monitor[ing] emails if it might prevent future terror attacks.' Among Democrats, 53 per cent found that practice acceptable. Republicans showed 45 per cent support. The Post reported Tuesday morning that 'sixty-nine percent of Democrats say terrorism investigations, not privacy, should be the government’s main concern, an 18-percentage-point jump from early January 2006.' Republican House Speaker John Boehner called Edward Snowden a 'traitor' and expressed support for Obama's intelligence program. A majority of GOP voters disagree . The U.S. intelligence controversy has produced strange bedfellows among pundits and political public figures who seldom agree about anything. Liberal firebrand Michael Moore and Conservative online broadcaster Glenn Beck have both called NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden a 'hero' for leaking information about the NSA to The Guardian and the Post. Fox News host Bill O'Reilly also slammed the NSA, saying its 'unconstitutional' surveillance program 'should be shut down immediately.' Left-wing television host Bill Maher came down in support of the NSA. 'I’m okay with it now that Obama’s in office,' he said on his HBO talk show. Joining him in support are South Carolina GOP Senator Lindsey Graham, conservative Fox News Channel pundit Charles Krauthammer and former General Electric CEO Jack Welch - none of whom is generally an Obama cheerleader. Right-wing broadcaster Glenn Beck is firmly against the NSA program, a position he shares with liberal filmmaker Michael Moore . 'I view Mr. Snowdens' [sic] actions not as one of patriotism but potentially a felony,' Graham tweeted on Monday. 'I hope we follow Mr. Snowden to the ends of the earth to bring him to justice.' The Wall Street Journal, which has . picked apart Obama's economic programs on a regular basis, published a . Sunday op-ed by former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey that . expressed support from the program. In contrast, Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan, the GOP's vice presidential nominee in 2012, told WRN Radio on Monday that the NSA spying program 'comes across as creepy.' 'To do a blanket dragnet nationwide,' he said, 'that seems to go way beyond the scope of the law that I’m familiar with called the Patriot Act.' Edward Snowden, who worked as a contract employee at the National Security Agency, outed himself this weekend as the source for The Guardian's reports on U.S. intelligence programs. He fled to Hong Kong and is now reportedly been offered asylum in Iceland . House Speaker John Boehner disagreed, calling Snowden a 'traitor' during an interview with ABC News. 'The president outlined last week that these were important national security programs to help keep Americans safe,' he said, \and give us tools to fight the terrorist threat that we face.' But among ordinary voters, the Pew/Post poll indicates a partisan divide that plays out among more traditional party lines. Pollsters reached 1,004 adults in the U.S., including a robust sample on cell phones.","56 per cent of Americans overall say government tracking of phone records is an 'acceptable way' to fight terrorism .
That number is heavily weighted toward Democrats, 64 per cent of whom support the NSA .
Under George W. Bush in 2006, just 37 per cent of Democrats agreed with NSA snooping .
Republican support for NSA surveillance also drops now that Obama is in charge, swinging more modestly from 75 per cent to 52 per cent ."
"A crazed man - who has hurt himself in public before - went on a raged-filed rant about the IRS and then attempted suicide in full view of Matt Lauer and the Today show team in Rockefeller Plaza this morning. Pak Chong Mar, 72, from the New York City borough of Queens began to cut his wrists as he stood in the audience for the popular breakfast show, screaming 'the IRS is watching me', before he was pepper sprayed and subdued by NYPD and Today show security. And it was revealed this afternoon that this is not the first time that Pak has hurt himself in public. In August 1995, he chopped off three of his fingers with a meat cleaver and threw his severed digits at the crowd during the Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival in Flushing. Police said to the New York Post that officers immediately noticed he was missing three fingers as they battled to removed the two blades he was brandishing. Scroll Down for Video . Suicide Attempt: With his arms outstretched the man can be seen holding a blade in his right hand . Ranting: The man comes to the attention of the NYPD who begin to call for assistance as it becomes clear he is a danger to himself and others . Conducting an exclusive interview with the New York Daily News from his bedside, Mar told that newspapers reporter how he was flat broke, unable to pay his rent and that this was a last, 'desperate' act. 'I had to do something desperate to fight the corruption, fight the IRS,' Pak Chong Mar told a Daily News reporter from Bellevue Hospital. Speaking in a rambling fashion as his wife and daughter sat by his bedside, blood covered Mar revealed he arrived in the U.S. from China in 1948 and claimed that his life savings which he valued at over one million dollars had been taken from him. 'I should be living well,' he said. ;I had over a million dollars before. They’re making my life miserable.' At around 7.50 a.m. Mar, armed with his two blades began . to cut his own wrists as he stood in the crowd which gathers year-round . to watch the iconic breakfast show air. Wearing . a grey T-shirt and a white baseball cap, Mar staggered through the . Today show audience and began screaming in broken English about the . Internal Revenue Service and how it ruined his life. According . to witnesses at the scene, Mar was yelling not only about the IRS and 'peppermint tea' but was trying to get bystanders to read documents he had brought along - . which he dramatically threw into the air. He . then used a pocket knife with a four-inch blade and exclaimed, 'I'm . going to cut myself!' before slicing his own wrist and arm. Dramatic . pictures and video from the scene reveal how Today show security staff . and the NYPD drew their guns and rushed to intervene as Mar - who . never attempted to harm anyone else - collapsed in a pool of his own . blood on the floor. He was peppered sprayed as he was subdued. Court records seen by the MailOnline for a Pak Chong Mar from 2007 indicate a New York state tax warrant for over $2,000. Stand-off: The man threatens to harm himself with his knife (left) before doing so and being subdued by Today show security and NYPD . Bloody: With blood clearly visible on the floor - the man who apparently tried to kill himself is subdued by security and the NYPD this morning while the Today show aired . While on the floor Mar produced a second knife and tried to cut his other wrist before he was disarmed. 'It happened really fast — and then he was down,' said 21-year-old Jossie Edwards, a tourist from Easley, South Carolina to the New York Daily News. In fact, one witness said that security and the NYPD was so concerned about the amount of blood coming from Mar - that they eventually used their own feet to keep him at bay. 'They didn’t want to touch him,' said Edwards' mother, Kim McLeroy. He was then promptly taken away by paramedics and no member of the Today show crew or host's were in danger of being harmed. 'I saw him take slice after slice. I saw the blood gushing,' said witness Kellie Ostransky, in town to celebrate her birthday with her twin sister. Ostransky, who is visiting from Phoenix said that she feared a terror attack similar to the recent murder in broad daylight of a London solider might be occurring. 'The first thing I thought about was that soldier in London, and I thought, 'Oh my God, this is happening.’ As he cut himself Mar screamed out loud 'the IRS is watching me' and prior to that had been handing out flyers said Ostransky's twin sister Kimberlee to the New York Post. 'He threw the papers up because nobody was taking them. He started cutting his wrists. People were running and screaming,' said Kimberlee. 'I thought this guy might be doing a protest and kill people, and the rest of us would be trampled,' she said. Clean Up: The scene after security had mopped up the blood and cleared the shocked audience members away . Jessica Lacy who works in Bouchon bakery in front of where the Today show is filmed said she arrived to work to find the area swamped by cops. She said there was 'tons of blood, tons of cops.' Another employee had been watching she show being broadcast when he said he witnessed a man hacking at this wrists. Kokou Amenouvar, 45, a tour guide from the Bronx said he arrived at work to find an ambulance and people rushing into the NBC building. 'People looked upset and police were escorting them out.' He said he wondered, 'why is he doing this?' Another man, who would give his name only as Robert said 'a gentleman came down the street. He was carrying papers in a folder in his hand.' 'As the camera came around he cut his wrists in front of the women and children that were there. 'The women and children were screaming. Next thing, a man tackled him to the ground. Police came out of everywhere. 'He had blood on his face but they had him strapped down for a while on a stretcher before taking him away.' 'The place was in lock-down.' The shocking incident was not shown to millions of morning viewers. 'He was in the crowd but off camera,' a police source told the New York Daily News. Explanation: Matt Lauer and his Today co-host's inform their viewers why the outside broadcast had to be moved indoors to the studio after a man apparently tried to commit suicide during the live show . Following the shocking incident, the . entire Today team had to abandon their . outside broadcast and move into the studio after the man stabbed himself . in full view of Lauer and co-host Savannah Guthrie - in his apparent . attempt to commit suicide. The audience was also evacuated from Rockefeller Plaza as the NYPD cordoned off and cleaned up the area. Informing . their viewers why they had moved indoors, a solemn Lauer said that a short time . ago a man was tackled by the Today show's security team after he began . to cut himself with a knife. Lauer, 55, was clearly shaken by the harrowing incident as he spoke for his colleagues, Guthrie, Natalie Morales and Al Roker. Speaking . live on air just after 8 a.m. Matt Lauer thanked the NYPD for their . swift response time to the incident and mentioned that even as the man . was harming himself he said out-loud that he didn't want to hurt others. 'Opening the 8 o’clock half hour inside the studio today because there . was an incident out on the plaza,' host Matt Lauer explained after the . commercial break. 'A short time ago, a man out there attempted to harm . himself with a knife. He did manage to cut himself.' 'He was controlled by our security team out there. However, he did harm . himself in some way. And so he’s now being attended to by medical . personnel.' Lauer added that the man 'did say something about not wanting to harm others.' Posting a message onto his Twitter feed just before 9 a.m. Lauer gave the all clear after the 'scary incident' and again thanked the Today show security team and the NYPD. NBC News issued the following statement: . 'We have strict security protocols in place to protect visitors to . the TODAY show and those procedures were followed and effective. We are . very grateful for the actions of our security team and the NYPD that no . others visiting the show were harmed in the incident.' Breaking News: Today show host Matt Lauer updated his Twitter followers with the news a man had attempted to kill himself with a knife while the popular breakfast show aired . Iconic Outside Broadcast: NBC Hosts Al Roker and Matt Lauer attend  NBC's 'Today' in Rockefeller Center on May 31, 2013 in New York, New York . Alex Weprin, a senior editor at MediaBistro said that 'police responded very quickly' and that regardless, there is no shortage of a police presence there. He was rushed to St. Luke's Hospital and the early indications from the medical staff are that he will survive. The NYPD confirmed that this morning an individual started to cut his wrists and possibly his arms, but was not in sight of any cameras recording the show.

"British heavy metal band Iron Maiden —  responsible for uncompromising songs such as  The Number Of The Beast and Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter — are getting ready for yet another world tour. The grizzled old veterans will criss-cross Europe in the spring and summer, before playing North and South America in the autumn. And in between these commitments, the band have announced they are releasing a beer called Trooper Ale. In collaboration with Cheshire brewery Robinsons, they plan to release Trooper, named after another of their songs, on May 9. The response has been colossal — more than 100 countries have asked to stock Trooper, and 300,000 pints are on pre-order. The brewery reports that it is at full tilt six days a week in an attempt to keep up with demand, and brewing three batches a day for the first time in its 175-year history. It’s a triumph for lead singer Bruce . Dickinson, who is a fan of traditional English cask beer, as he was the . one who helped formulate the recipe for a beer with ‘citrus notes’ and . 4.7 per cent alcohol. Heavy metal: Bruce Dickinson is Iron Maiden's lead singer. The band has sold 85million albums . But . then Dickinson is accustomed to success: Iron Maiden, routinely ignored . by music critics, have an enormous global fan base, and have played more . than 2,000 gigs since their early Eighties heyday. They’ve also sold . 85 million albums. And they . have in Dickinson, their front man since 1981, one of the most . extraordinary figures in the rock world. For he is a polymath who has . turned out to be brilliant at almost anything he turns his hand to, and . that now includes making beer. On stage he wears tight trousers, ghoulish head-dresses and sleeveless Gothic T-shirts. In normal life, he is Renaissance Man in leather who has been a foil fencer at the highest level, once ranked seventh in Britain, and was invited to join the UK Olympic team. He is an accomplished commercial pilot, and has run an airline. He has also written a couple of novels — just for fun. Today, he runs an aircraft . maintenance company in Wales. And he is an investor in a project to . create an unmanned Zeppelin spy airship for the U.S. government, at a . cost of up to £500 million. And . all the time, of course, he has been the lynch-pin of Iron Maiden, one . of the most influential bands in rock history. As he says: ‘Where else . can a 54-year-old still run around in a jockstrap and tights and not get . arrested?’ The son of an . Army mechanic, Dickinson was born in 1958 in Worksop, and brought up in . Sheffield. At first he was raised by his grandparents — his mother . having fallen pregnant at 16. But at four, his father felt he was . making enough money to support a child, and he moved in with his parents . again. His father ran a boarding house, and later sold cars. As . a teenager, he was sent to board at Oundle public school, near . Peterborough, which he hated. He says that he was picked on because of . his northern accent and working-class roots. However the school helped . to feed his interests — in planes, submarines and rockets. He also . became seriously interested in fencing. Iron brew: The band's new beer is called Trooper Ale.

He recalls that his metalwork teacher . happened to be an amateur fencing coach, and he started teaching him — . sparking a lifelong passion for the sport. However, . he was expelled from Oundle after boiling up some of his own urine and . pouring it on to his headmaster’s plate of mange-touts as a prank. He . explained in an interview: ‘I knew it wouldn’t harm him. I’d done a bit . of chemistry.’ He . considered a career in the Army, but instead started a degree in modern . history at Queen Mary College in London. He was a fan of Black Sabbath . and Deep Purple and began to sing in a band, Samson. In 1981 he was . approached by Iron Maiden to come on board. They were in need of a lead . singer. Paul Di’Anno, the incumbent, had developed a crippling fondness . for cocaine. Di’Anno . commented: ‘It wasn’t just that I was snorting a bit of coke; I was just . going for it non-stop 24 hours a day every day. The band had . commitments piling up and I just couldn’t see my way to the end of it.’ Multi-talented: Dickinson is also a highly ranked foil fencer and was once asked to join the British Olympic Team . Dickinson didn’t really go in for such excesses. He said that he drank a lot of vodka, and slept with lots of girls, and smoked a bit of dope, but that was it. And while some heavy metal bands make excessive demands for lavish amounts of food and alcohol to be available backstage, on a recent tour, the ‘rider’ for Iron Maiden featured only red wine, a loaf of bread and some tuna, so they could make sandwiches — modest indeed. Not for them the drug-induced madness of Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath. That’s not to say there haven’t been Spinal Tap moments. On one tour they enacted an onstage mock-sacrifice of a cage full of supposed vestal virgins. But Dickinson claims: ‘We’ve always had an acute awareness of our own absurdity.’ By his own account, his lowest point came during a tour of Japan when he found himself crawling along a hotel corridor in Tokyo, blind drunk and ravenous, desperately searching for leftover food on discarded room-service trays. ‘Afterwards, I just thought: “There’s got to be more than this.” That’s when I took up fencing again and decided to learn how to fly.’ The pinnacle of his fencing career . came when his local club won the National Team Championship in 1989. He . was ranked seventh in the UK that year. As . he said: ‘I think the best way to find out about something is to try to . do it to the max. A lot of people take up a hobby or sport and then . find an excuse not to carry on with it. Once I start something, I won’t . stop until I’m as good at it as I’ll ever be.’ Dickinson . wanted to fly a plane from the age of five and qualified as a . commercial pilot in 1998 during a break from Iron Maiden (he left in . 1993 and went back in 1999). He has flown around 500 hours a year ever . since for a number of commercial airlines. He also flies Iron Maiden on . their tours. Last year . he launched Cardiff Aviation, a maintenance, repair and overhaul company . in a hangar in an old RAF base. He is well regarded in the business, . and was the keynote speaker at Lufthansa’s 50th anniversary symposium. He also has a stake in Hybrid Air . Vehicles, a Bedfordshire-based company, which last year won a . £500million contract with the US defence department to build a ‘long . endurance, multi-intelligence vehicle’ — an unmanned spy airship. Planes . run out of gas after about 18 hours, but this thing can sit at 20,000ft . and look down on the bad guys for three weeks,’ he explains. ‘What . we’ve got here is the rebirth of the British airship.’Today, . he lives in Chiswick, West London, with his wife Paddy, a photographer, . and their three children Austin, 15, Griffin, 13, and Kia, 11. He likes . to joke that they were all home births and he served ‘as the wicket . keeper’. Dickinson with Iron Maiden musicians Steve Harris, Dave Murray, Janick Gers, Adrian Smith and Nicko McBrain . The one recent controversy he has suffered seems to have been at the hands of another unstoppable monster of rock, Sharon Osbourne. When Iron Maiden played the Ozzfest heavy metal festival in California in 2005 they were pelted with bottle tops, lighters and eggs by Black Sabbath fans, and there were suspicions that someone also interfered with their sound. Not long before the concert, Dickinson had made comments about reality television being ‘a complete disgrace — freak-show television, the lowest of the low.’ Sharon Osbourne, who had allowed cameras into her home to film her family for fly-on-the-wall documentary The Osbournes, later admitted that she had personally cut Iron Maiden’s sound several times, and that the egg pelting had been sanctioned by her. ‘I did cut the band’s sound,’ she said. ‘Ozzfest is our tour. Dickinson doesn’t have the manners to realise that when you are invited into someone’s home, are seated at their dinner table, are eating their food and drinking their wine, you shouldn’t talk disrespectfully about them. ‘Dickinson got what he deserved. We had to listen to his b******t for five straight weeks. He only had to suffer a couple of eggs on the head.’ He later said: ‘One big lesson I’ve learned is that you cross Sharon Osbourne at your peril.’ There are some obstacles, it seems, which even this remarkable polymath cannot overcome.","More than 300,000 pints of band's beer Trooper Ale already pre-ordered .

"A mystery footprint has been spotted at a millionaire’s mansion in the bedroom where his girlfriend was just minutes before she allegedly hanged herself. Rebecca Zahau, 32, died at the mansion of Jonah Shacknai, 54, in Coronado, California, in July, two days after his son Max, 6, was fatally hurt from a fall off the stairs while she was looking after him. The Zahau family - who continue to believe she did not commit suicide - hired a forensic expert, who believes the shoe impression on the carpet probably came from someone other than police. Evidence: A mystery footprint (top right) has been spotted at a millionaire Jonah Shacknai's mansion in the bedroom where his girlfriend Rebecca Zahau was just minutes before she allegedly hanged herself . Death: Rebecca Zahau, 32, left, died at the mansion of Jonah Shacknai, 54, right in Coronado, California, in July, just two days after his son Max, 6, who she was looking after, was gravely hurt from a fall off the stairs . Dr Maurice Godwin told RadarOnline.com that the toe print - pictured in the photo that formed part of police evidence - is ‘underneath the foot of the bed’, which suggests it is probably not from a cop. Police believe Miss Zahau hanged herself after a call from Mr Shacknai told her that his son was about to die. Max died soon after Miss Zahau was found hanging at Mr Shacknai’s mansion. Police said Rebecca was alone – but the family are not convinced and believe she could have been murdered. This footprint suggests there could have been another person in the bedroom with her. RadarOnline.com also reported that a witness who claims to have heard a ‘scream for help’ hours before she was found dead was twice ignored by police when they tried to report the information. Now you see it, now you don't: The family of Rebecca Zahau want authorities to reopen the case after a video shows the same mansion balcony without the rope the sheriff's office said she used to kill herself . Murder or suicide? The 'pink rope,' shown in this crime scene photo, is what police say Rebecca Zahau hanged herself with at her boyfriend's California mansion . The person contacted the family of the . dead woman last Wednesday with the information, which . casts doubt on the conclusion that she committed suicide. 'This . witness is credible and their information has been verified, so one is . left to wonder why police did not listen to this individual,' a member . of the Zahau family told RadarOnline. According . to the witness, they heard a scream from the mansion at 11pm local . time. Police concluded that Miss Zahau committed suicide at 3am. New . evidence has also cast doubt on the conclusions about his death too. The boy's physician, Dr Brad Peterson, was quoted in a search warrant . saying suffocation may have occurred prior to his fall. Suicide: Rebecca Zahau, right, was found hanging naked at Jonah Shacknai's mansion in Coronado, California . From above: An aerial view of the historic mansion in California where the tragedy happened in July . Manchester United fan: Max was revealed to have broken his spinal cord in his fall, and was not breathing and had no pulse when he was found . Max was found unconscious at the base . of the stairs at his father's vacation home in California, where Miss . Zahau was discovered dead two days later. Max’s death was determined an . accident. His neck was . broken and he was found not breathing and with no pulse by Ms Zahau at . the bottom of the stairs after she heard a noise and came to look. She . was the only adult at home at the time. Miss . Zahau and her teenage sister Xena were the only people at home at the . time of Max's accident. Cops contend Miss Zahau was in the bathroom when . it happened and Xena was in the shower. When . Miss Zahau's naked body was found hanging from the mansion's balcony . with her ankles and wrists bound, investigators were quick to say they . were not ruling out suicide. They . eventually determined no evidence of foul play, sexual assault or a . struggle. She was alive when she went over the balcony and died by . hanging. There was no alcohol or drugs in her system.

"Navy training and testing could inadvertently kill hundreds of whales and dolphins and injure thousands over the next five years, mostly as a result of detonating explosives underwater. The Navy said that the studies focused on waters off the East Coast, the Gulf of Mexico, Southern California and Hawaii from 2014 through 2019, the main areas that the service branch tests equipment and trains sailors. The studies were done ahead of the Navy applying to the National Marine Fisheries Service for permits for its activities. The Navy said that it if hadn't done so and was later found to have harmed marine mammals, it would be found in violation of federal environmental law and have to stop its training and testing. Sorry: The Navy studied how underwater explosives and other sailor training will affect sea mammals and found that hundreds will die and thousands will be seriously hurt and there's nothing they can do about it . Most of the deaths would come from explosives, though some might come from testing sonar or animals being hit by ships. Rear Adm. Kevin Slates, the Navy's energy and environmental readiness division director, told reporters this week the Navy uses simulators where possible but sailors must test and train in real-life conditions. ‘Without this realistic testing and training, our sailors can't develop or maintain the critical skills they need or ensure the new technologies can be operated effectively,’ Slates said in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday. According to the reports, computer models show it may kill 186 whales and dolphins off the East Coast and 155 off Hawaii and Southern California. Practice shots: The study determined that most dolphin and whale deaths will result from explosions from practice torpedoes and missiles over the next five years . The Navy said it developed the estimates by totaling the hours it will test and practice with sonar, torpedoes, missiles, explosives and other equipment over five years. Experts then combine the data with what's known about the marine mammals and then use computer modeling. Off the East Coast, there could be 11,267 serious injuries and 1.89 million minor injuries like temporary hearing loss. The reports said the testing and training might also cause marine mammals to change their behavior – such as swimming in a different direction – in 20 million instances. Off Hawaii and Southern California, the reports said that the naval activities may cause 2,039 serious injuries, 1.86 million temporary injuries and 7.7 million instances of behavioral change. But Michael Jasny, senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the Navy was underestimating the effect its activities on marine mammals. Injuries: The Navy study also found that their activities will likely seriously injure around 11,000 animals and cause nearly 2 million less severe injuries . For example, he pointed to a study by government and private sector scientists published just last month in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society showing mid-frequency active sonar can disrupt blue whale feeding. The study says feeding disruptions and the movement of whales away from their prey could significantly affect the health of individual whales and the overall health of baleen whale populations. Jasny said the Navy's ocean activities are ‘simply not sustainable.’ ‘These smaller disruptions short of death are themselves accumulating into something like death for species and death for populations,’ Jasny said. One of the statements covers Hawaii and Southern California, while the other covers the East Coast and Gulf of Mexico.","The East Coast, Hawaii, Southern California, and Gulf Coasts will all see hundreds of whale and dolphin deaths .
The Navy also expects about 11,000 serious injuries to the creatures, as determined by a study submitted to the National Marine Fisheries Service ."
"A leading academic has called for the terms 'gay pride' and 'black pride' to be scrapped because they are 'meaningless'. Broadcaster and educational consultant Dr Tony Sewell has argued that instead of defining people as minorities, society should be instead striving to define people as 'what they know rather than what they look like'. He . claimed the situation was now so bad that working class white boys . had been given a 'fictitious' minority label of their own, despite vast regional differences across the country. Meaningless: Education consultant Tony Sewell has called for the term 'minority' to be scrapped because it labels people . In an interview with the Readers Digest, Dr Sewell said: '""Minority"" should be the badge that people are trying to rip off. 'Instead, in the case of certain . musicians, authors and others, it can bring you money and fame. This is a . corruption and a deceit. 'We need to ditch gay pride and black pride. Both are meaningless. 'The gay rights movement is surely a human struggle for homosexuals to be treated equally. Who said anything about a community?' Dr Sewell runs summer schools for deprived children through his charity Generating Genius. He said most of his cohort were 'predominantly bright black boys'. And he argued that teachers should stop reinforcing cultural identities by allowing youngsters 'rap versions of Macbeth' rather than reading standard Shakespeare and Chaucer. He said: 'Too often what poses as cultural identity is, in reality, ignorance or bad education. 'Black and other children need to be schooled in the lexicon of the mainstream, where ""street talk"" is not seen as another version of Chaucer. 'The standard Shakespearean canon should predominate against the curse of a rap version of Macbeth. Barrier: Mr Sewell believes 'gay pride' had originally been about fighting for equal rights, not establishing a separate 'community' 'I love rap music, by the way, but it shouldn't be a defining feature of young black men.' He claimed that the 'biggest barrier' to his own success had been goals was allowing his minority status give him a sense of 'victimhood'. Pointing out none of the children working with his charity wanted to feel like they belonged to a minority, he said: 'In fact, as part of the course, we deprogramme them from thinking they're locked into an ethnic community. 'We want them to be defined by what they know, not what they look like.' Dr Sewell added: 'Of course, racism is also a constraint on certain groups and we need laws to protect us from the excesses and evils of mankind. 'But no young person can really take flight in the open skies of the world when placed under the heavy hand of minority status, policed by their friends, family and foes.' Speaking today, Dr Sewell moved to qualify the details when he said: 'These terms were used in the 70s to help us in the struggle against inequality, but it's been turned around. 'When people were locked out of opportunities these terms were useful, but they're not useful now, particularly in a complex society like the UK. 'I've no idea what you can define as 'black' now because people are so mixed. I do think it's got lost on its way from a framework of political liberation to where certain people almost get benefits from it. 'Young people in particular, if they're going to access opportunities, what's the biggest barrier? And that barrier's the status that's around them, put upon them and sometimes the one they attach themselves to. 'Successful people have moved from that. It's about transcending these barriers.' Dr Sewell's comments have been criticised by lesbian, gay and bisexual charity Stonewall. Spokesman Richard Lane said: 'I've never met anyone talking about a separate gay community away from the rest of society. 'Fifty-five per cent of lesbian, gay and bisexual people have experienced verbal and physical bullying. Bullying: Charity Stonewall claims 55 per cent of gay, lesbian or bisexual youngsters experience victimisation . 'That leads to instances of suicide, self-harm and mental health problems and that's the real reason that holds people back. 'What we've seen on the news in the past few weeks is the situation in Russia, and dozens of countries that persecute, criminalise and terrorize gay people. 'What we've got to do in Britain is show that we've not forgotten there is still a huge amount of work to do.' Dr Sewell has aired his views on this issue before. In a 2010 article in Prospect magazine, Dr Sewell argued that while it was once true that black pupils were held back by racism, ‘times have changed’. He wrote: ‘What we now see in schools is children undermined by poor parenting, peer-group pressure and an inability to be responsible for their own behaviour. ‘They are not subjects of institutional racism. ‘They have failed their GCSEs because they did not do the home work, did not pay attention and were disrespectful to their teachers. ‘Instead of challenging our children, we have given them the discourse of the victim – a sense that the world is against them and they cannot succeed.’","'Minority' is the badge people should 'rip off', according to charity founder .

"A pair of fraudsters orchestrated one of Britain's biggest-ever fake ID scams by selling thousands of counterfeit documents on the black market for as little as £50. The duo, both from London, ran such an elaborate scheme that they became the 'go-to' forgers for criminal and illegal immigrants seeking new identities in the north of the capital. Arsene Meci, 26, originally from Albania, manufactured the made-to-order documents - including passports, driving licences and national identity cards - from his home in East Finchley. Scroll down for video . Arsene Meci, 25, from East Finchley (left) and Medi Krasniqi, 47, from Finsbury Park, orchestrated one of Britain's biggest-ever fake ID scams by selling thousands of counterfeit documents on the black market . He then passed them on to 47-year-old Medi Krasniqi, from Finsbury Park, who sold them to criminals for between £50 and £500, depending on what was required. Once the cards were made, the pair would carry out handovers in shops and cafés in the Turnpike Lane area of north London. Krasniqi was also in charge of locating the clients, gathering photos and obtaining personal details which he would then pass on to Meci. But the pair - who specialised in making the false documents for use in the construction industry - were arrested in October as part of a three-year investigation by the National Crime Agency. The probe, which looked into a series of Albanian-led cells dealing in false documentation, has so far led to 15 convictions and a collective jail sentence of 56 years. Carl Eade, senior investigating officer from the NCA, said: 'Krasniqi and Meci really were the ""go-to"" men for anyone who wanted any form of false ID anywhere in north London.

A search of a property linked to Krasniqi led to the seizure of around £12,000, found stuffed behind an oven (pictured) 'Their clients included criminals and people in the UK illegally. 'The thousands of passports, identity cards and other documents they were creating and selling were then used to help people obtain work or services they weren't entitled to.' He added: 'Worryingly there is a safety element here too - one of the forms of ID they specialised in was certification to work in the construction industry. 'We have no way of knowing whether their clients were actually qualified to do the jobs they were then able to apply for.' When Krasniqi was arrested, police found 70 counterfeit cards in his possession. A search of a property linked to Krasniqi led to around £12,000 being found stuffed behind an oven.

"Amazing photographs, captured in vivid colour, show life in Russia in the early 1900’s as the country stood on the brink of the First World War - and revolution. Photographer Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky was one of the nation’s leading photographers at the beginning of the Twentieth Century. He was commissioned to capture a photographic record of Russia after the monarch saw his colour portrait of Leo Tolstoy. The portrait of Tolstoy, taken in 1908, just two years before the author's death, was Prokudin-Gorsky's most famous work and became widely popular and was reproduced on postcards, large prints and in various publications. The last Emir of Bukhara: Photographer Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky captured Russia on the brink of modernisation. Pictured here in lavish robes is Emir Seyyid Mir Mohammed Alim Khan, the final Emir of Bukhara (present-day Uzbekistan), ca. 1910. The photographer was commissioned by Tsar Nicholas II to travel around Russia capturing images of the nation in the early years of the 1900s, in full colour . An Armenian woman in national costume poses for Prokudin-Gorsky on a hillside near Artvin (in present day Turkey) In order to capture the scenes in colour, Prokudin-Gorsky had to take three photos, each time with a different colour filter over the lens, which meant that sometimes, when subjects moved, the colours would blur and distort - as seen in this image . It also caught the eye of the royal family and Prokudin-Gorsky was invited to present his work to Tsar Nicholas II and his family in 1909. The Tsar was so impressed with the photographs he commissioned him to travel across Russia, documenting the nation in colour images. The project was supposed to run for 10 years and see Prokudin-Gorsky collect 10,000 photos. During 1909-1912, and again in 1915, Prokudin-Gorsky completed surveys of 11 regions, travelling in a railroad car provided by the government which was equipped with a darkroom. Prokudin-Gorsky, who was born into an aristocratic family in St Petersburg in 1863 and studied chemistry and art, was granted access to areas of Russia that were forbidden to everyday citizens. This allowed him to document Russia’s people and landscapes at the beginning of what would be a dramatic century for the nation. The photographer was able to capture the scenes in colour, allowing the audience a vivid sense of what life looked like, through using a three-colour technique. This involved taking three separate photographs, one with a red filter, one with a green filter, one with a blue filter. These monochromatic images would then be projected through filters of those same colours on to a screen and superimposed. When seen through a final filter, they would appear amazingly realistic.

After leaving Russia in 1918, Prokudin-Gorsky moved to Germany, where he remarried and had a daughter, Elka. He then moved to Paris and was reunited with his first wife and three adult children, with whom he started a photography studio . The tsar granted Prokudin-Gorsky access across the nation and provided with a railway car equipped with a dark room . Prokudin-Gorsky was one of the most famous photographers in Russia at the beginning of the 20th century . Prokudin-Gorsky learnt the method in 1902 when he travelled to Berlin to study under the photochemist Adolf Miethe. Using this method, Prokudin-Gorsky became a well-regarded photographer and was appointed as editor of Russia’s most important photography journal, the Fotograf-Liubitel. He was not able to finish his ten-year, 10,000-print project. After the October revolution in 1917, Prokudin-Gorsky was offered a professorship under the communist regime, but a year later he left Russia for good. By this point he had created an estimated 3,500 negatives, but many of these were confiscated when he left the country and only 1,902 have been recovered. These were purchased by the U.S. Library of Congress in 1948 and published in 1980. Prokudin-Gorsky fled to Germany and then Paris, where he married his lab assistant and had a daughter, Elka. In Paris, he was reunited with his three adult children and first wife, Anna Aleksandrovna Lavrova, with whom he remained on good terms until his death in 1944. He continued his photographic work, including setting up a studio in Paris and publishing papers in English photography journals. The studio, which he set up with and bequeathed to his three adult children, was named Elka, after his youngest daughter.

"Emile Griffith, the world champion boxer best remembered for fatally beating his opponent in a 1962 title bout, died Tuesday at age 75. He died at an extended care facility in Hempstead, New York, the International Boxing Hall of Fame said. The U.S. Virgin Islands native struggled with pugilistic dementia and required full-time care late in life, likely due to the blows he received throughout his career. Scroll down for video: . Champ: Pictured later in his life, Famed world champion boxer Emile Griffith has died at 75. He was best known for a title bout he won and which ultimately proved deadly for his opponent Bennie Paret . Griffith was the first boxer from the U.S. Virgin Islands to become world champion and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1990. ‘Emile was a gifted athlete and truly a great boxer,’ Hall of Fame director Ed Brophy said. ‘Outside the ring he was as great a gentleman as he was a fighter. He always had time for boxing fans when visiting the hall on an annual basis and was one of the most popular boxers to return year after year.’ Griffith often attended fights in New York, especially at Madison Square Garden, where he headlined 23 times. He was also a frequent visitor to the many boxing clubs around New York City. He would slowly rise from his seat, often with assistance, and smile while waving when he was acknowledged. Fatal blows: Cuban-born Benny 'Kid' Paret, 25 years-old, is carried from the ring at Madison Square Garden after the title fight he lost to Griffith in March 1962, a fight that ultimately killed him . Ill-fated: The doomed 'Kid' Peret grins as he reads Griffith's weigh prior to the fight that put him in a coma, before he died 10 days later . The outpouring of love that he received late in life stood in stark contrast to the way he was received after March 24, 1962, when he fought Bennie ‘The Kid’ Paret before a national TV audience at the Garden. Griffith knocked out his bitter rival in the 12th round to regain the welterweight title. Paret went into a coma and died from his injuries 10 days later. Sports Illustrated reported in 2005 that Griffith may have been fueled by an anti-gay slur directed at him by Paret during the weigh-in. Over the years, Griffith described himself at various times as straight, gay and bisexual. ‘People spit at me in the street. We stayed in a hotel. Every time there was a knock on the door, I would run into the next room. I was so scared,’ Griffith told The Associated Press in 1993, recalling the days after Paret's death.

The shocking outcome left a cloud over the sport for many years. NBC stopped airing boxing broadcasts, and then-New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller created a commission to investigate the bout and the sport. The referee that night, Ruby Goldstein, never worked another fight. The fight became the basis for the 2005 documentary Ring of Fire: The Emile Griffith Story. One of the final scenes shows Griffith embracing Paret's son. ‘I was never the same fighter after that. After that fight, I did enough to win. I would use my jab all the time. I never wanted to hurt the other guy,’ Griffith said. ‘I would have quit, but I didn't know how to do anything else but fight.’ And fight he could. Skillful: Pictured here in a 1969 title fight against champion Jose Napoles at the Forum in Los Angeles, Griffith was known more for his slick style and speed than for his punching power . Number 1: Griffth smiles after regaining his welterweight world championship title by defeating Luis Rodriguez, at New York's Madison Square Garden in 1963. Griffth died July 23 at age 75 . Known for his overwhelming speed and slick style — certainly not his punching power — Griffith was a prodigy from the moment he stepped in Hall of Fame trainer Gil Clancy's gym in Queens. Griffith had been working in a hat factory when, as the story goes, he took off his shirt on a hot day and the factory owner realized how strong he was. Under the eye of Clancy, Griffith blossomed into a New York Golden Gloves champion and eventually turned professional. He easily defeated the likes of Florentino Fernandez and Luis Rodriguez during an era when it was common to fight every couple of weeks, quickly earning a welterweight title shot against Paret in 1961. Softer side: In this 1965 photo, Griffith relaxes by painting in his New York hotel room. The International Boxing Hall of Fame says the former world champion boxer has died at 75 . Serious company: Flanked by boxing legends Buster Mathis and Joe Frazier in 1968, Griffith was among fellow champions . Griffith won the championship with a 13th-round knockout at the Garden before losing the belt to Paret in a rematch five months later. After winning back the title during his controversial third fight with Paret — many believe Paret never should have been allowed in the ring after a brutal loss to Gene Fullmer three months earlier — Griffith would eventually move up to middleweight. He knocked down Dick Tiger for the first time in his career and claimed the title with a narrow but unanimous decision. Griffith would go on to lose twice during a thrilling trilogy with Nino Benvenuti, his lone victory coming at Shea Stadium in 1967, and lost two bouts against the great middleweight Carlos Monzon. Griffith would finally retire in 1977 after losing his last three fights, his record standing at 85-24-2 with 23 knockouts. Film worthy: The legendary fighter poses at the premier of Ring Of Fire: The Emile Griffith Story, which aired on the USA Network . Griffith would go on to train several champions, including Wilfred Benitez and Juan Laporte, among the most popular boxers in Puerto Rican history. His humor and generosity buoyed those close to him as his health deteriorated in later years. He would still make the pilgrimage to Canastota, N.Y., for the Hall of Fame induction ceremonies, regaling fans young and old with tales, even though the details often became hazy, the result of the many blows he sustained during his career. There was no immediate word on survivors or funeral arrangements. Griffith smiles at a 2007 event retiring Madison Square Garden's historic boxing ring. Griffith suffered from dementia late in life due to the blows he took as a boxer. He died July 23 at an extended care facility in New York .","Griffith was a welterweight then middleweight champ revered for his slick, lightning quick style .

"The Foreign Office has warned against travel to various parts of Turkey except in cases of emergency following another day of rioting. Tens of thousands took to the streets in the country’s four biggest cities yesterday – the third day of anti-government protests – with demonstrators clashing with riot police, who repelled them with tear gas. The unrest initially erupted on Friday when trees were torn down at a park in Istanbul’s main Taksim Square under government plans to redevelop the area. But they have widened into a broad show of defiance against the Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP). Scroll down for video . Blaze: An anti-government protester holds Turkey's national flag with a portrait of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk on it . Gas: Police use water cannon as protesters run to avoid tear gas during the third day . Choke: Turkey's prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan rejected claims that he is a 'dictator,' dismissing protesters as an extremist fringe . Riot: A protester falls down as he tries to throw back at police a tear gas canister . Prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan blamed the main secular opposition party for inciting the crowds, and said the protests were aimed at depriving his ruling AK Party of votes as elections begin next year. Erdogan said the plans to remake the square, long an iconic rallying point for mass demonstrations, would go ahead, including the construction of a new mosque and the rebuilding of a replica Ottoman-era barracks. And he said the protests – which were started by a small group of environmental campaigners but mushroomed when police used force to eject them from the park on Taksim Square – had nothing to do with the plans. Crowd: Young Turks clash with security forces in Ankara as the protest rages on . Shout: Riot police detain a protester during demonstrations against Turkey's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan . ‘It’s entirely ideological,’ he told . Turkish television. The demonstrations have since drawn in a wide range . of people of all ages from across the political and social spectrum. Protests yesterday were not as . violent as the previous two days but police used tear gas to try to . disperse hundreds of people in Ankara’s main Kizilay Square. There were . similar clashes in Izmir and Adana, Turkey’s third and fourth-biggest . cities. In Taksim Square, the atmosphere was . more festive with some chanting for Erdogan to resign and others singing . and dancing. There were later clashes between police and protesters . near Erdogan’s office in a former Ottoman palace in the city. The main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) denied orchestrating the unrest. ‘Today the people on the street . across Turkey are not exclusively from the CHP, but from all ideologies . and from all parties,’ senior party member Mehmet Akif Hamzacebi said. Some 2.5 million Britons visit Turkey each year and it is an increasingly popular destination for holidaymakers from the UK. The Foreign Office has also warned Britons to avoid travelling to areas close to the Syrian border. Day three: Protesters gather for the third day of nationwide anti-government protest at the Taskim square in Istanbul . Riots: A protester holds a riot policeman's helmet as thousands of people gathering for another rally against the conservative government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Istanbul on Sunday . Turkish Interior Minister Muammer Guler yesterday said more than 1,700 people had been arrested in anti-government protests that have spread to 67 cities nationwide, though most have since been released. 'A large majority of the detainees were released after being questioned and identified,' he said in remarks carried by the state-run Anatolia news agency. He added that the country had seen 235 demonstrations since Tuesday.Meanwhile Britons are being urged to avoid trips to Turkey until the ongoing riots have dissipated. The . Foreign Office said on its website: ‘Demonstrations are taking place in . Istanbul and in other cities across Turkey, including Ankara. ‘Police are using tear gas and water cannon in response. We advise British nationals to avoid all demonstrations.’ Police used tear gas on protesters in . Ankara but the clashes so far today were relatively minor compared with major . violence in Turkey's biggest cities on the previous two days. Meanwhile . Turkey's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan accused the main secular . opposition party of provoking the wave of anti-government protests.

Wreckage: A street vendor sells umbrellas in front of destroyed police cars in Taskim square in Istanbul . Calling the protesters 'a few looters', Erdogan said he would press ahead with redeveloping Istanbul's Taksim Square, a project which provoked the demonstrations that have widened into a broader show of defiance against his Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP). Erdogan singled out the Republican People's Party (CHP) - set up in 1924 by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk who founded Turkey's modern secular state - for attack over a dispute he described as ideological. 'We think that the main opposition party which is making resistance calls on every street is provoking these protests,' Erdogan said on Turkish television. Turkey's fiercest anti-government unrest for years erupted when trees were torn down at a park in Taksim Square under government plans to construct a new mosque and rebuild a replica Ottoman-era barracks.

This is based on ideology,' said Erdogan, whose . conservative vision for the nation has angered more liberal Turks. Referring to the planned mosque, he added: 'Obviously I will not ask for . permission for this from the head of CHP or a few looters.' Tens of thousands gathered on Sunday . after a calmer night in Taksim Square, which saw two days of clashes . between protesters and riot police backed by armoured vehicles and . helicopters. The atmosphere was more festive with . some chanting for Erdogan to resign and others singing and dancing. There was little obvious police presence.

'We will stay until the end,' said . Akin, who works in motor trade and has been in Taksim for the past four . days. 'We are not leaving. The only answer now is for this government to . fall. We are tired of this oppressive government constantly putting . pressure on us.' There were more than 90 separate . demonstrations around the country on Friday and Saturday, officials . said. More than 1,000 people have been injured in Istanbul and several . hundred more in Ankara, according to medical staff. The ferocity of the police response in . Istanbul shocked Turks, as well as tourists caught up in the unrest in . one of the world's most visited destinations.

"A war of words broke out between the International Monetary Fund and the EU yesterday over its  bungled bailout of Greece. The IMF admitted to ‘notable failures’ in the handling of the Greek crisis and accused European officials of being more concerned with saving the euro than  rescuing the debt-ridden country. The Fund, headed by Christine Lagarde, said it was forced to break its own rules for providing financial assistance to bankrupt countries because EU leaders refused to take action to solve the crisis. Blunder: The IMF has admitted mishandling the Greek debt crisis, leading to violent anti-austerity protests like this demonstration in Athens last November . The IMF report, drawn up by staff at . the watchdog’s headquarters in Washington, triggered a furious response . in Brussels where the European Commission said it was ‘plainly wrong and . unfounded’. A spokesman for Olli Rehn, European commissioner for economic affairs, said: ‘We  fundamentally disagree.’ Britain was forced to find more than . £1billion to prop up Greece, and in turn the euro, through the UK’s . membership of the IMF. Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, . said: ‘Taxpayers were roped into bailing out Greece via the back door. Now it turns out they botched even that. The eurozone built itself on a . debt bubble and it’s scandalous that hard-pressed families are . shouldering even a penny of that bill.’ The IMF and the EU granted Greece a £93billion bailout in May 2010. The Fund now admits there were serious mistakes in the way it and EU officials handled the bailout. Street battles: Protesters and police have repeatedly clashed as the country's economy has shrunk . The report said the catalogue of errors – including harsh austerity measures on Greece – plunged the country deeper into crisis. Greece is in its sixth consecutive . year of recession with unemployment at 27 per cent and youth . unemployment at 62.5 per cent – meaning more than six in ten young . Greeks who want a job cannot find one. The IMF said the ‘dramatic . contraction’ in the Greek economy was driven by the refusal of European . officials to consider writing off the country’s debts as early as 2010. The debt burden was eventually . restructured last year – meaning investors were paid less than what they . were owed as the burden on Greece was partially lifted. ‘Not tackling the public debt problem . decisively at the outset or early in the programme created uncertainty . about the euro area’s capacity to resolve the crisis and likely . aggravated the contraction in output,’ said the IMF report. Fury: Many Greeks blame outsiders such as German chancellor Angela Merkel for the deep recession . ‘An upfront debt restructuring would have been better for Greece although this was not acceptable to the euro partners.’ The IMF said the rescue packages were . nothing more than a ‘holding operation’ to give the eurozone ‘time to . build a firewall to protect other vulnerable members’ – in other words, . an attempt to save the euro whatever it meant for Greece. ‘Market confidence was not restored, . the banking system lost 30 per cent of its deposits, and the economy . encountered a much deeper than expected recession with exceptionally . high unemployment,’ said the IMF. The EU insisted that writing off . Greek debt as suggested by the IMF would have led to ‘devastating . consequences’ as investors fretted about losses in other eurozone . countries. A spokesman said: ‘With hindsight we . can go back and say in an ideal world what should have been done . differently. The circumstances were what they were. I think the . Commission did its best in an unprecedented situation.’","IMF report admits fund forced austerity measures on Greece too quickly .

"An elderly man found living in south-central Vietnam has claimed to be a U.S. war veteran who was presumed dead after his helicopter was shot down during a special ops mission over Laos in 1968. But despite the potentially astonishing discovery, the man's two daughters - whom he has never contacted since disappearing - have refused to take a DNA test to prove his identity. The wife and daughters of Sgt. John Hartley Robertson, a one-time Green Beret, initially agreed to participate in DNA testing, before changing their minds last year, according to a filmmaker behind a new documentary asking whether the man is indeed who he says he is. 'Somebody . suggested to me maybe that's (because) the daughters don't want to know . if it's him,' said Jorgensen. 'It's kind of like, ""That was an ugly war. It . was a long time ago. We just want it to go away"". 'I . don’t know. What would compel you not to want to know if this person is . your biological father?' Scroll Down for Video . Discovery: Special Forces Green Beret Master Sgt. John Hartley Robertson is the subject of a documentary which claims to have found him alive - now revealed as incorrect - 44 years after he supposedly died in Vietnam . Mystery no More: Dang Tan Ngoc (pictured) has been revealed to be an imposter who had repeatedly tried to impersonate a MIA Vietnam veteran . Sgt. Robertson's name is etched along . with 60,000 others onto Washington D.C.'s poignant Vietnam memorial, . but now the documentary questions whether he is actually alive and well. The filmmakers claim to have tracked . him down to south-central Vietnam - where the 76-year-old is unable to . remember his birthday, his American children’s names, or how to speak . English. The makers of 'Unclaimed' say that . the wiry, forgetful man could very well be a missing POW from the . distressing conflict, and that fellow servicemen could 'lose their minds' when they hear the story of how he never returned . home. 'Sgt. Robertson' told Emmy-award winning filmmaker Michael Jorgensen that when his flaming helicopter crashed to the ground during a firefight on a Laos mountaintop, he was captured immediately by North Vietnamese soldiers. Fake? Robertson, a former U.S. Army Green Beret and member of an elite MACV-SOG unit, was listed as Missing In Action in 1968. But a fellow Vietnam vet who claims he has met a man claiming to be him set off a media storm on Tuesday . Out of sight: Dang Tan Ngoc (pictured) claims to be Robertson, but has forgotten how to speak English . 'They locked me up, high in the forest, . in a cage,' he said. 'I was in and out of consciousness from torture and . starvation. The North Vietnamese soldier hit me on the head with a . stick, shouting, ""American!"" 'Then he would hit me even harder; I thought . I would die. I never said anything, though they beat and tortured me.' Mr . Robertson said he escaped after four years, hid in the woods and was . found in a field by a woman who nursed him back to health and then . became his wife. He said he borrowed her late husband’s surname and birth date and was registered as a French-Vietnamese resident named Dan Tan Ngoc. The couple then had children but no recorded attempt was made to contact his wife or children back home in America. Search: Vietnam veteran and humanitarian Tom Faunce, pictured, has become obsessed . with proving that the 76-year-old man he has found in Vietnam is indeed . Sgt. John Hartley Robertson . John Hartley Robertson was born in Birmingham, Alabama on October 25, 1936, and went by the name of Johnny. He was the third of five children born to John Cheslea and Mildred Robertson. He grew up during World War II, and it was this influence that led him to drop out of high school at 17 so he could get his GED and join the Army, according to the film makers. He went on to join the U.S. Army Special Forces, known as the Green Berets, and was later chosen to join an elite Special Operations Group known as Military Assistance Command, Vietnam – Studies and Observations Group (MACV-SOG). On May 20, 1968, he was on a mission when his helicopter came under enemy fire and crashed. A full search mission was not possible and he was declared Missing in Action. On April 28, 1976, he was officially declared dead by the military, leaving behind a wife, Wanda Robertson, and two daughters. The documentary follows the quest of . Vietnam veteran Tom Faunce as he seeks to prove that the man he first . heard about in 2008 while on a humanitarian mission was indeed a fellow . serviceman. Fonce . contacted Jorgensen to see if the filmmaker would follow his story to . establish that Robertson was still alive - but at first the director was . cautious. 'The MIA story was pretty unbelievable, pretty grandiose,' he said to the Globe and Mail. 'I was very skeptical.' However, what struck Jorgensen more than the idea a Vietnam veteran could have stayed undetected for 44 years was Faunce's own journey as a soldier, alcoholic and victim of child abuse. Jorgensen said he was inspired by how Faunce would 'go all the way in helping someone he didn't even know.' He added that 'no matter how the story turned out with John, I knew there was just a great ""once upon a time"" with Tom.' In Vietnam, Faunce tracked down the man who was locally rumored to be a former American Green Beret who had never returned home. 'Tom went to meet him and was very skeptical, grilled this guy up and down trying to get him to break, to say, ""Oh, no, I’m just making it up."" And he was adamant he was that guy,' Jorgensen told The Toronto Star. Growing up: Robertson is pictured with his older sister Jean, other siblings and their parents . Former life: Robertson's parents, JC and Mildred, are pictured left, while Robertson himself is pictured in uniform in 1955, when he would have been 19 years old, two years after dropping out of school . Soldier: Robertson is pictured left in 1968 - the year he was declared missing after his helicopter crashed . As the director delved further into the bizarre story, he discovered unusual evidence for Robertson's claims. He found that reports existed as early . as 1982 of Robertson's alleged survival, leading him to question why his . family were not contacted to help provide proof. 'Why did the Americans leave him there for all those years?' Jorgensen asked The Globe and Mail. 'Are there other John Hartley Robertson's in Vietnam?' Jorgensen answered his own question, adding 'a highly-placed source has told him there are and it's not because the Vietnamese won't let them go, it's more the U.S. Military doesn't want them to come home'. Indeed, Jorgensen said that the U.S. government . first became aware of the man as early as 1991, and tried to verify his . identity in 2006. The team discovered that in 2010 Robertson was fingerprinted at the U.S. Embassy. His siblings were never informed. Faunce was reportedly told that there was not enough proof to confirm this was John Hartley Robertson - to which they replied that there was not enough evidence to suggest he wasn't. As the film proceeds, stronger personal reunions add to the case that the elderly man who seems to suffer from dementia is indeed the American special forces solider. Jean Robertson Holley, said she will not have a DNA test as she knows it's him . Younger years: Jean and her younger brother are pictured center while growing up in Alabama . There is a tearful reunion with a soldier who Robertson trained in 1960 - who claims he knew it was him on sight. And . there is a moving moment when the man is brought back together with his sister, . 80-year-old Jean Robertson Holly, at her home in Canada - who would have . been Sgt. Robertson's only surviving sister. 'Jean . says... ""There’s no question. I was certain it was him in the video, but . when I held his head in my hands and looked in his eyes, there was no . question that was my brother"",' Jorgensen told the Toronto Star. This could be confirmed if Robertson-Holly agreed to DNA . testing, but she said she does not need to take the test to know the man is her brother. Jorgensen recruited a Vietnamese speaking police officer from Edmonton to act as a translator. At work: Cinematographer Allan Leader and filmmaker Michael Jorgensen pictured in Vietnam in 2012 . Film: Jorgensen's film, Unclaimed, will be showed at Toronto's Hot Doc's festival on Tuesday evening . Questions: Faunce walks along the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington D.C. The translator, Hugh . Tran, said that the elderly man spoke just like a Vietnamese native with no trace of . an American accent - leading him to become very suspicious. 'I still didn’t believe...  until I saw the family reunion,' said Tran about the emotional meeting with his sister. Other moments made Jorgensen believe they had the right man. At the family reunion, Robertson also met his sister's husband, Henry, and told him that he remembered him working in a drugstore. Henry did indeed work for as a pharmacist for 15 years. And when shown pictures of his two American daughters, he reportedly cried. Jorgensen said he believes that no matter what viewers take away from the film, which opens on Tuesday at the Toronto Hot Docs festival, the man who claims to Robertson fulfilled his wish: to see some of his American family before he dies. Heroes: American flags stand at the base of a statue of American Soldiers of the Vietnam War in D.C. Hot Docs director Chris McDonald, . said he had never seen an audience react with so much emotion after . seeing the film of Mr Robertson's life. He . said: 'Everyone was wobbly and teary - and curious. If this individual . is a legitimate MIA left behind, as the family and filmmakers believe, . it's hard to overestimate what the impact might be.'","Sgt.

"Brothers Zefi, 12, Marsel, 7, and Marsela, 9, do not understand the simple pleasures of an ordinary childhood. They don't go to school or visit friends, even kicking a football around the garden is out of the question. Instead the youngsters have spent their entire lives locked inside their home in the Albanian village of Bardhaj, 76 miles north of the capital Tirana, prisoners of a family blood feud which makes it too dangerous for them to venture outside.

Killings under the Kanun are known as Gjakmarrja or blood-taking, and are similar to the Italian tradition of vendetta. The practise is said to date back to medieval times although some historians say they can trace its origins to the Bronze age.

"Detectives are investigating a homicide in Washington state home owned by a man linked to the D.B. Cooper skyjacking mystery. A woman called police Friday to report that she had gone to the home in Woodinville, northeast of Seattle, to check on her father and found him dead, said King County Sheriff's Sgt Cindi West. Reports said that the home is owned by Earl Cossey, 74. Death investigation: The murder was reported at the home of Earl Cossey, 74, in Woodinville, Washington . Map: Locations in Washington where Cooper was . originally thought to have landed and where some of the ransom money was . found in 1980 . Citing King County property records, KIRO-TV reported that Cossey, a former skydiving instructor, lived in the home. He is the man who packed the parachutes used by infamous airplane hijacker D.B. Cooper more than four decades ago. The woman had not heard from him in several days. The victim's identity is not expected to be released until Monday, after it is confirmed by the King County Medical Examiner's Office. Skyjacker: D.B. Cooper hijacked a Northwest Orient plane from Portland, Oregon, to Seattle in one of the Northwest most notorious mysteries . But West said Saturday that detectives have ruled the case a homicide. On November 24, 1971, a man in a suit and sunglasses calling himself Dan Cooper - later mistakenly identified as D.B. Cooper - hijacked a Northwest Orient plane from Portland, Oregon, to Seattle. After getting on the plane, he ordered . whiskey and lit a cigarette before passing a flight attendant a note . that read: 'I HAVE A BOMB IN MY BRIEFCASE. I WILL USE IT IF NECESSARY. I . WANT YOU TO SIT NEXT TO ME. YOU ARE BING (sic) HIJACKED.' At Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, he released the passengers in exchange for $200,000 and four parachutes, and he asked to be flown to Mexico. Somewhere near the Oregon line, Cooper leapt out of the plane. Despite intensive searches, no sign of Cooper ever emerged. Investigators doubt he survived and have never been able to determine his true identity. But a boy digging on a Columbia River beach in 1980 found three bundles of weathered $20 bills - Cooper's cash, according to the serial numbers. The parachutes provided to the skyjacker came from an Issaquah skydive center which had recently purchased them from Cossey. The one Cooper apparently used was a military-issue NB6, nylon, 28-foot with a conical canopy. Over the decades, as parachutes were sometimes discovered in the area of Cooper's jump, the FBI turned to Cossey to ask if they were the real thing. Plot: A hijacked Northwest Airlines jetliner 727 . sits on a runway for refuelling at Tacoma International Airport on . November 25 1971 . Clues: Three packets of ransom money, totalling $5,800, were found on the Columbia river in February 1980 . Cool culprit: Impressions of Cooper as a smartly-dressed man have added to the fascination nature of the mystery .

Southwest Washington. 'Every time they find squat, they bring . it out and open their trunk and say, 'Is that it?' and I say, 'Nope, go . away.' Then a few years later they come back.' That didn't keep Cossey from having fun at the expense of reporters who covered that discovery. Vital clue: Cooper's cheap clip-on tie was one of the items recovered after the skyjack . He told some who happened to call him on April Fools' Day that year that the chute was, in fact, Cooper's. One reporter called him back and angrily said he could get fired for writing a false story, Cossey said. Another said the newsroom was amused by the prank. 'I'm getting mixed reviews,' Cossey said. 'But I'm having fun with it. What the heck.' The mysterious hijacking has intrigued everyone from federal agents to amateur sleuths. There were more than 1,000 possible suspects considered over the past four decades. Several people even claimed to be Cooper at times, but were dismissed on the basis of physical descriptions, parachuting experience and, later, by DNA evidence recovered in 2001 from the cheap, clip-on tie the skyjacker left on the plane. Many believe that Cooper was Richard McCoy, a Vietnam War veteran, experienced parachutist and BYU political science student who staged a similar hijacking several months later. But the FBI has said that McCoy - who was killed in a shoot-out with law enforcement officers after a prison break in 1974 - simply didn't fit the description of Cooper provided by two flight attendants.","Home where murder occurred is owned by 74-year-old Earl Cossey, who packed the parachutes for D.B.

"A female mobile phone boss in Russia has been accused of 'humiliating' sales managers by forcing them to pose almost naked as 'punishment' for poor sales figures. Her employees were ordered to strip to their underwear or swimming costumes and their pictures were posted on a closed company website, it is claimed. The site was only accessible to staff of Russian mobile giant MTS - until the pictures were leaked onto the open web with the faces hidden. Punishment: A female mobile phone boss in Russia has been accused of 'humiliating' sales managers by forcing them to pose almost naked as 'punishment' for poor sales figures . Yulia Biktimirova, the accused mobile phone boss, has denied the claim, saying her employees in the region of Tatarstan were instead willingly posing for pictures to enliven a corporate party. Despite her denial, the head office of MTS - one of the big three mobile networks in Russia - has launched a formal investigation into the claims. An ex-manager, identified only as Sergei R, told the Russian media that Biktimirova 'forced employees to pose half naked if they failed to sell certain goods within a set period of time. If they refused, they lost their money. Undress: One source said staff were forced 'to pose in their underwear or bikinis in their offices' 'One day I just could not cope with such humiliation any longer and abused this top manager.

Biktimirova insisted: 'Our employees did really pose in swimming costumes in our offices but it was purely their own idea. 'They were getting ready for a corporate party and decided to take shocking pictures thinking it would be funny and unusual. 'We do not have punishments.

"Organs are to be taken from the dead and used for transplant without consent for the first time in Britain. A Bill passed last night means that in Wales it will be presumed a person has agreed to donate their organs unless they specifically opted out before they died. Doctors would be able to make use of the body parts even if it was against the family’s wishes. From 2015 doctors in Wales will presume a person has agreed to donate their organs unless they have opted out (file picture) The Bill passed last night means doctors will be able to make use of body parts even if it was against the family's wishes . The Welsh Assembly backed the move, a significant shift in the tradition of altruistic donation in the UK, despite opposition from churches and from within the Muslim and Jewish communities. The new law will come into force by 2015. It will apply to over-18s who die in Wales if they have lived there for more than 12 months. However, such a change is unlikely to be introduced in England after a taskforce recommended against an opt-out system five years ago. Under the current ‘opt-in’ system, people are asked to join the NHS organ donor register and if they fail to do so, relatives may be asked if they were aware of their loved one’s wishes. In the UK, there are 10,000 people on the list for an organ. They wait an average of three years for a suitable donor and every day three people on the waiting list die. Currently 19.5million – just under a third of the population – are signed up to the Organ Donor Register. The NHS is aiming to increase this to 25million. Under the current 'opt-in' system, people are asked to join the NHS organ donor register and relatives may be asked if they were aware of their loved one's wishes if they fail to do so (file picture) Of the 1,000 donors assisting people after their deaths each year, one-third are on the register. Ways of boosting the supply of organs have been hotly debated, with organisations including the British Medical Association calling for an opt-out system. The aim of the presumed consent law in Wales is to increase the number of organs available  by 25 per cent. There are 10,000 people on the list for an organ in the UK and they wait an average of three years for a suitable donor while every day three people on the waiting list die (file picture) Just over 30 per cent of organs donated in Wales are transplanted into people living there. Ministers would have a duty to publicise the new system. Welsh Assembly Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: ‘The legislation makes it absolutely clear that if you are uncomfortable with being an organ donor you have an absolute right in the simplest way possible to opt out of the system. ‘You put your name on the organ donor register saying you don’t want to be a donor and that is the end of the matter. There is nothing to be scared of.’ The Kidney Wales Foundation has campaigned for the law change but a statement from faith leaders and health professionals called for a ‘soft opt-out scheme’ that would give families a say on donation if the deceased had neither opted in nor out. Dan Boucher, Wales public affairs officer for Christian charity CARE, said: ‘If the Bill does not respect either the consent of the deceased or of their family, there is a real risk of this legislation backfiring as people feel pressurised by the state and withdraw from donation. ‘This would be a tragedy and needlessly put lives at risk.’ A 2011 report from the Nuffield Council on Bioethics said donations had increased by 25 per cent in recent years, partly due to more efficient hospital systems. It recommended that organ donors should get their funeral expenses paid by the NHS. Spain and Belgium have opt-out laws but similar schemes in Australia and elsewhere are claimed to have deterred donors. In Northern Ireland a public consultation is underway over an opt-out system. In Scotland, ministers have said the option was ‘not completely off the agenda’.","In Wales it will be presumed a person has agreed to donate their organs .

"Veteran: Lt General Sir Hew Pike, who led 3 Para in the 1982 conflict, is 'saddened' that the pontiff believes the Falklands belong to Argentina . Falklands veterans told of their dismay last night after the Argentine president hinted she hoped the new Pope – her countryman – would mediate in the dispute surrounding the territory. Pope Francis believes the South Atlantic islands are ‘Argentine soil’. In 2010 the then Buenos Aires Cardinal declared: ‘The Malvinas are ours’, and last year he accused Britain of ‘usurping’ the islands. Firebrand Argentine president Cristina Kirchner, who has for months been seeking easy home popularity by calling for Britain to enter talks on withdrawing from the Falklands, has leapt on the promotion of her fellow Argentine to the papacy to boost her case. In a televised address yesterday she pointedly said she hoped the new Pope would ‘take a message to the major world powers that they need to participate in dialogue’. The controversy was stoked up only days after the islanders voted almost unanimously to retain their ties to London. Last night retired Lieutenant General Sir Hew Pike, who commanded 3 Para in the 1982 conflict, said the newly elected leader of the Catholic Church seemed not to recognise the Falkland islanders’ right to self-determination. Sir Hew, 69, said the Pope’s statements about the Falklands gave no recognition of the islanders’ wish to remain British. Sir Hew said: ‘It saddens me that a man of the Pope’s stature does not seem to respect the rights of a group of people to self-determination. ‘We went to war on the basis of that principle of self-determination, for that small community of people in the Falklands, and that’s the point. One would have thought a priest should respect that. Newly-elected Pope Francis, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina, claims 'Las Malvinas' belong to Argentina and called Britain 'usurpers' Pope Francis celebrates his inaugural Mass with cardinals inside the Sistine Chapel, at the Vatican yesterday. Last year he said: 'We must not forget those who shed their blood on Argentinian soil' Argentina's President Kirchner hopes the appointment of Francis will boost her plans to take the islands . ‘Communities large or small are equally important in this world, but it seems that people like him don’t recognise that. I profoundly disagree with the Pope’s stance. ‘I think when Popes get involved in politics that’s probably not very helpful.’ Major General Malcolm Hunt, who commanded 40 Commando Royal Marines, suggested the Argentine pontiff should take a more diplomatic stance after his elevation. Referring to his stated belief that the islands belong to Argentina, General Hunt said: ‘It is not ideal, it doesn’t help, and it certainly suits Madame Kirchner to have these things said by such a person. ‘He’ll no doubt say something more diplomatic now he’s Pope. ‘But certainly I would have thought that a man of faith would have been in favour of everybody, wherever they are, having some say about their own life and future.’ Pope Francis has been urged by British veterans of the Falklands war to take a more diplomatic stance . President Kirchner’s relationship with the former Archbishop of Buenos Aires has until now been thorny, the two having engaged in open battle over gay marriage. When the conservative Cardinal Bergoglio called for ‘God’s War’ on her government’s gay marriage proposals, Kirchner accused him of putting forward ideas ‘from the Dark Ages and the Inquisition’. He replied that women were ‘too inept’ to hold political positions. But given her one-time enemy’s new influence, not to mention supposed infallibility, all that seems to be water under the bridge. pope girlfriend graphic.jpg . The Argentine leader has already cleared her diary to fly to Rome for the Pope’s inaugural Mass on Tuesday. Falklands tensions started to rise again when oil and gas prospectors raised hopes of massive reserves around the islands in 2010. Since then President Kirchner’s government has imposed an increasing economic blockade on the islands, limiting charter flights from the mainland to one a week, and trying to prevent cruise liners from visiting. She has dismissed this week’s 99.8 per cent vote in favour of retaining British sovereignty, comparing the islanders to squatters. The new Pope’s first act was a visit to the tomb of a predecessor who was a model of morality. Pope Francis travelled three miles to the Basilica Santa Maria Maggiore, where 16th century Pope Pius V  is buried. His visit appeared to symbolise his hopes for his Papacy. St Pius is remembered by Catholics for his hatred of corruption and his attempts to bring discipline and morality to the church. He is also known for his enthusiasm as the church’s chief inquisitor, credited with driving Protestantism out of Italy. Pius V was also the Pope who excommunicated Queen Elizabeth I on the grounds that she was a usurper – the word the modern Cardinal Bergoglio has used to describe the British role in the Falkland Islands. Today Pope Francis will prepare for his unprecedented conference with the world’s media tomorrow. Pope Francis laying a wreath yesterday. The natives of the Falkland Isleands voted overwhelmingly to remain British earlier this week . Killed: Elena de la Cuadra was pregnant when kidnapped by Argentine police in 1977 . Pope Francis was accused yesterday of being ‘complicit in a genocidal government’ by victims of Argentina’s dictatorship. As Jorge Bergoglio, he was head of the Jesuits in Argentina in the 1970s when the Church backed the country’s brutal military junta. Tens of thousands were kidnapped or killed during the ‘dirty war’ on supposed dissidents. They were known as ‘the disappeared’. The new Pope has been linked to the ‘stolen babies’ scandal in which around 500 infants were seized by the state. Estela de la Cuadra, whose niece Ana was among those taken, told Brazilian newspaper O Globo: ‘The Catholic Church has chosen a person who for us, families of the victims of repression exercised by the military, was complicit in a genocidal government.’ Four members of the de la Cuadra family disappeared during the dictatorship. One, Elena, gave birth to Ana in prison before she was killed and the baby was seized. Her family claim they contacted Bergoglio asking for his help getting Ana back. He is alleged to have assigned Monsignor Mario Picchi to investigate the case. But Picchi was told by a colonel it was ‘impossible’ to return the child as she had been given to ‘too important a family’. Pope Francis has claimed he had no knowledge of stolen babies until after the end of the dictatorship in 1983. He has also been accused of failing to prevent the five-month ordeal of two of his own priests in 1976. Orlando Yorio and Francisco Jalics were kidnapped after being branded dissidents for their work with the poor in Buenos Aires. They were tortured at a military prison in Buenos Aires before being drugged, blindfolded and dumped in a field. Picture taken in 1973 of the then priest Jorge Mario Bergoglio, who was elected Pope yesterday . Angela Lerena, an Argentine journalist and relative of Father Orlando, described the election of Pope Francis as ‘a black day’ for her family. Investigative journalist Horacio Verbitsky has published a book called ‘The Silence’ accusing Bergoglio of being complicit in the kidnappings. It claims he withdrew support for the two priests’ work, effectively handing them over to the death squads. The new Pope claims he instructed the two priests to give up their work in the slums for their own safety, and that he worked behind the scenes for their release. He recently told a newspaper: ‘I did what I could with the age and little influence I had.’","Pope Francis calls Falkland Islands 'Argentine soil'

He added that the islet may not last long due to erosion, but if enough volcanic lava surfaces and solidifies it could create a new marker on the map.

"'The Grizz': Tire tycoon Maurice Taylor said French workers were 'lazy' and 'overpaid' An American industrialist has provoked fury in France after attacking the workforce of a factory he was asked to take over. Tyre and wheel magnate Maurice Taylor said he would be ‘stupid’ to take on staff at the ailing Goodyear plant in Amiens because they stood around chatting and worked only three hours a day. Mr Taylor, who stood as a Republican presidential candidate in 1996, has a track record of turning around failing businesses around the world. He was approached by the French government to take over the Amiens factory after Goodyear announced it was closing it, putting 1,173 jobs at risk. But after a trip round the base, the famously abrasive boss of Titan International told French industry minister Arnaud Montebourg he can ‘keep his so-called workers’. Yesterday he told the Daily Mail there was no comparison between the hard-working staff at his UK plant in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, and the union-cosseted tyre makers he found in northern France. ‘At Titan Steel Wheels in Kidderminster, we can have our disagreements but they work,’ he said.‘They have an hour off for lunch but the rest of the time they work. When I went round the Goodyear factory, the workers have a seven-hour day. One hour they’re paid to do nothing but eat, scratch themselves or whatever. Scroll down for video . 'Lazy': Workers leaving the doomed Goodyear tire plant in Amiens, northern France, which Mr Taylor has refused to rescue as Goodyear announces a 39 per cent cut to their French workforce . Blunt: The Titan International boss was scathing in his assessment of the work ethic of staff at the Goodyear factory in Amiens . ‘But the problem was that they spent three more hours just moseying around, talking. ‘But when I told their union leaders this, they told me that’s the French way!’ Mr Taylor said he was stunned by the . attitude of the factory’s myriad union leaders – led by the local head . of the communist-backed CGT union – when he met them at a hotel to . discuss how he might rescue the plant. The French have some of the best working conditions in the world - but its economy is flatlining. It has been beset by the combined effects of a rigid job market, complex labour laws, and fraught labour relations. Under socialist rules introduced in 2000 workers put in 35 hours a week, down from 39 hours a week. Yet its jobless rate is at a 13-year high. More than one in ten of the workforce is unemployed. France's economy stalled in 2012 and growth contracted by 0.3 percent in the final quarter of 2012. If it contracts again in the first quarter of 2013, it will be back in recession — officially defined as two straight quarters of negative growth. Public spending already accounts for almost 57% of national output, the public debt stands at over 90% of GDP and in January 2012 it lost its AAA grade from Standard & Poor’s, a rating agency. French President Francois Hollande is desperately trying to make the country, the world's fifth largest economy, more competitive by slashing government spending and relaxing Labour regulations. But he faces opposition from the traditionally strong union movement which resists changes to employment law. In January the country's powerful unions finally agreed to labour law reforms following talks that had dragged on for three months. The measures will allow for greater latitude in slashing salaries and firing staff, but will also offer more protection for employees, including better health cover. In France, the legal length of the working week is 35 hours in all types of companies. The working day may not exceed 10 hours, and employees may not work for more than 4.5 hours without a break.The maximum working day may be extended to 12 hours under a collective agreement. In principle, no more than 48 hours a week may be worked, 44 hours per week on average over a period of 12 consecutive weeks (up to a maximum of 46 hours, under conditions). Workers are entitled to a break of at least 20 minutes every six hours, and all staff must be allowed a daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours - although that figure can be reduced to nine in some cases. The minimum weekly rest period is 35 consecutive hours (11 hours plus a 24 consecutive hour rest period per week). Sundays are largely considered to be rest days in France. The average salary in France is €20,783, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, significantly higher than the OECD average of €16,749. ‘The first thing out of the CGT guy’s mouth was, “You’ve got to guarantee our jobs for life”,’ said Mr Taylor. ‘They were telling us, “We’re not going to agree to anything until you do what we say”. ‘That’s when I said, “Hey you’ve got . it all backwards. I’ve got enough people thinking I’m nuts even . attempting to come over and run this facility and spend millions of . dollars on it”.’ ‘The French worker can be as productive as anyone else when he works, but he’s not working,’ Mr Taylor said. The US businessman, who is based in . Illinois, has told the French government in no uncertain terms he will . not be taking up its offer of taking on the factory. ‘Do you think we’re stupid?’, Mr . Taylor asked Mr Montebourg in a letter published in French business . newspaper Les Echos. ‘I’ve visited this factory several times. The . French workers are paid high wages but only work three hours,’ he said. ‘They get one hour for breaks and lunch, talk for three hours and work for three.’ He warned that Chinese and Indian . tyre makers were taking over the market in Europe, adding: ‘In five . years, Michelin won’t be producing tyres in France. You can keep your . so-called workers.’ Mr Taylor’s remarks have provoked . anger in France where the high tax, big government policies of socialist . president Francois Hollande are raising fears about declining . competitiveness. Mr Montebourg has declined to comment on the American’s letter, saying only: ‘I don’t want to harm the interests of France.’ The CGT union – the main target of Mr . Taylor’s anger – said the ‘insulting’ letter showed that its author was . more of a ‘lunatic’ than someone fit to ‘hold the reins of a . multinational’. Four years ago, . former French finance minister Christine Lagarde, now head of the . International Monetary Fund, also branded French workers as 'lethargic'. She . told French newspapers: ‘Instead of thinking about their work, people . think about their weekends, organising, planning and engineering time . off. ‘If you say to a French person, “would you like to be an entrepreneur?” all they do is run scared.’ A recent global study of working hours also revealed the French worked the fewest hours of any country on earth. The report by Swiss bank UBS found . the French work for just 1,480 hours a year, with 27 days annual holiday . meaning they have more free time than any other nation on the planet. Britons . work 1,782 hours a year - 301 more than the French - and have 20 days . holiday a year, making us the world's 36th most lazy nation, it was . found. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co's .

Centre Denis Hurley's late try, plus an Ian Keatley conversion and penalty, could not mask Munster deficiencies, as Saracens overpowered them up front and won an overwhelming majority of midfield collisions. And while Munster's European fate looks sealed, Saracens appear well equipped to make another assault on silverware, even if they did not collect a bonus point their dominance deserved. Billy Vunipola of Saracens builds up some momentum as he breaks through the Munster defence . Saracens were boosted by the return of England centre Brad Barritt for his first appearance since suffering a calf muscle injury on Test duty in late November, while skipper Alistair Hargreaves recovered from a knock to pack down alongside second-row partner Jim Hamilton. But Saracens suffered a late blow when prolific try-scoring wing David Strettle was ruled out with back trouble, so Wyles deputised and Ben Ransom featured on the bench. And Munster's Ireland international scrum-half Conor Murray missed out due to a neck problem just three weeks before this season's Six Nations kick-off, which meant a start for Duncan Williams. Saracens made the early running, setting up camp inside Munster's 22 with Ashton prominent, and they deservedly took a ninth-minute lead through an angled Farrell penalty. Ian Keatley of Munster (bottom) is tackled by Owen Farrell of Saracens (centre) in Saturday's encounter . Munster struggled to handle a powerful Saracens scrum, and it was no surprise when that imposing set-piece platform provided the foundation for an opening try midway through the first half. Once again, Saracens found themselves within striking distance of Munster's line, and they made it count as scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth fired possession wide to Farrell, and three passes later via Ashton and full-back Alex Goode, Wyles crossed unopposed. It was simple rugby executed in majestic fashion by Saracens, and Farrell's conversion gave the home side a 10-0 lead that their territorial control warranted. And Munster's early troubles showed no sign of abating as their often-influential number eight CJ Stander limped off 12 minutes before half-time, before a second Farrell penalty put Saracens 13 points clear, with Munster offering little to suggest they would recover from such a deficit. A Keatley penalty opened Munster's account as the interval approached, and it sparked a temporary spell of dominance before Saracens were handed back the initiative when the visitors spilled possession in midfield. Kelly Brown  of Saracens looks focussed as his side cruised to a 33-10 victory against the Red Army . Munster then conceded a penalty on halfway, and Saracens prospered after opting to run the ball back, with Wyles sending a brilliant kick behind the Irish side's defence before Ashton reacted quickest to touch down. Farrell's conversion made it 20-3, and Munster could have no complaints, appearing clueless when faced by a heady combination of Saracens' power game and silky skills with ball in hand. Farrell could not miss off the tee either, completing his penalty hat-trick with the final kick of a one-sided opening 40 minutes as Munster found themselves with a mountain to climb at 20 points adrift. They managed to keep Saracens quiet for much of the third quarter, but a fourth Farrell penalty took the home side further ahead before Munster again were forced into reverse gear, defending frantically inside their 22. Andrew Conway of Munster runs forward with the ball as he looks for a way to get his team back in the game . Munster were a more cohesive unit in the second period, but Saracens had long since inflicted telling damage as visiting prop James Cronin was sin-binned by referee Romain Poite for tackling a player off the ball. Saracens flanker Jacques Burger and Munster skipper Peter O'Mahoney then got involved in a touchline skirmish, and although Poite took no action, it fired the visitors into action and Hurley touched down near the posts 10 minutes from time, with Keatley converting. Inevitably, though, Saracens had the final word in a game that they dominated when the outstanding Ashton led Munster's defence a merry dance by touching down and completing a richly impressive afternoon's work. Hooker Jamie George had a relatively stress-free afternoon as Saracens moved to the top of Pool One .","The win sees Saracens move to the top of Pool One .

"Toulouse wing Yoann Huget has received a formal warning for feigning injury during his team's European Champions Cup defeat against Bath last Sunday. European Professional Club Rugby said the warning was issued by match citing commissioner John Charles.

"A schoolboy in China bled to death when a fake doctor cut his throat with a scalpel to treat his sore tonsils. Xiu Tsao, 35, had taken her 11-year-old son Yang Chin to a clinic in Chaochuan Village, Xiaotun Town, Henan Province, unaware that it was operated by fraudsters. It was run by Zhang Wenli, 46, who claimed to be a top throat specialist, but in fact he had no qualifications at all. His nurses were also completely unqualified. Dangerous fraudster: The name card of so-called laryngologist Zhang Wenli, who in fact had no qualifications at all and fled after he killed a schoolboy by cutting his throat while supposedly treating him for sore tonsils . Tragic: A man points to where sawdust covers the blood Yang Chin shed as he was dying in the clinic . The mother said that the boy had been performing really well at school and when he had been taken ill with a sore throat, she had heard the clinic could get him back to school quicker than if she took him to the hospital. She said she had taken him inside and the doctor had announced that the inside of his throat was a bit raw, and he needed to bleed away some of the bad blood to cure the problem. 'He used a scalpel and I noticed that blood was coming out of my son's mouth,' Central European News quoted her as saying. 'He told me it was perfectly normal but he stopped the bleeding process then. 'He had already made several incisions by that point. But my son was still in difficulty and I could see him kicking his legs while the doctor held onto him.' Unsuspecting: The clinic in Chaochuan Village, Henan Province, which the fake doctor had run for years . Some of the tools used by the fake doctor: Zhang had announced that the inside of the boy's throat was a bit raw, and he needed to bleed away some of the bad blood to cure the problem . After three minutes, she said, the boy's legs had stopped moving. The doctor still insisted it was normal, but had by then called an ambulance. Emergency medics could only confirm that the boy was dead, after which the doctor and his staff fled. Police confirmed they were looking for them and also confirmed that the qualifications of the staff of the clinic which had been operating for years were completely fake.","Zhang Wenli had run his throat clinic for years but had no qualifications .

"Sheffield United manager Nigel Clough believes a Capital One Cup semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur has given the League One club the perfect opportunity to finally leave their part in the Ched Evans saga behind them. Clough has turned his club into the modern day giantkillers to be feared by all others over the last couple of years, with last year’s run to the semi-final of the FA Cup meaning that they have only lost once in their last 17 cup games. As incredible as that is, United are unfortunately still tainted a little by their attempts to sign convicted rapist Evans on his release from prison last year. That move was eventually scrapped after pressure from outside and indeed their own sponsors and now Clough hopes they can move on. Sheffield United discussed re-signing convicted rapist Ched Evans (right), pictured with girlfriend Natasha . Evans played for Sheffield United before being jailed for five years for rape, of which he served two-and-a-half . The former Manchester City striker was pictured leaving a gym in Wilmslow last week . Jamal Campbell-Ryce (centre) celebrates scoring against Queens Park Rangers in the FA Cup . West Ham players looked dejected after they conceded against Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup . ‘That’s good and it is always nice when there are more positive headlines, with stories focused on what is happening on the pitch,’ said Clough. ‘Every football club wants to be talked about because of what it does on the pitch rather than off it and this gives us another opportunity to be discussed in a good light.’ Certainly Clough and his players deserve some positive PR. Last season’s FA Cup efforts saw them beat Aston Villa and Fulham before they lost to Hull City at Wembley. This season, meanwhile, they have knocked Queens Park Rangers out of that competition and overcame Southampton at home in the last round of this one. Nigel Clough, manager of Sheffield United, has already beaten Premier League outfit twice in the competition . Players celebrate after Michael Doyle scores the winning penalty in a shoot-out against West Ham United . Marc McNulty (right) scores Sheffield United's winning goal against Southampton in the quarter-finals . Clough is modest enough to suggest some of his team’s success has its roots in good fortune. The statistics don’t lie, though, and undoubtedly the United manager’s policy of routinely fielding strong teams in cup ties has paid off. On Wednesday night he merely hopes his team can get out of White Hart Lane without a hiding. If they are still in touch with Spurs before next week’s second leg in Yorkshire then logic and recent history suggests they will have a great chance. Asked if Tottenham may be under some pressure on Wednesday night, Clough said: ‘Certainly in the home leg, yes. We have that same feeling week in and week out in League One. Tottenham Hotspur boss Mauricio Pochettino and his side must be wary of Sheffield United . Michael Higdon of Sheffield United celebrates with his team-mate after scoring against Milton Keynes Dons . ‘At Bramall Lane, people expect us to roll teams over but for the opposition it is one of their biggest games of the season. ‘Hopefully, the roles will be reversed on Wednesday but without doubt they have the quality to hurt you, even if we play to our absolute maximum. ‘If Harry Kane is on song, Christian Eriksen and people like that, they have the quality to hurt any team in Europe. United players celebrate dumping Premier League high-flyers Southampton out of the Capital One Cup . ‘But we don’t fear it. We are aware of how good they are but we don’t go into too much detail otherwise we would shaking before we even get on to the pitch. ‘I’m not sure Tottenham will be too worried, looking at them in the last few weeks. I don’t think they’ll be too concerned but I think they’ll be more aware of us. ‘If you get results in the cup competitions I think the opposition does become a little bit more aware, and cautious we hope, but with what they’ve got to put on the pitch they’ll back themselves. ‘We’ve got to try and stay in the tie for the second leg. That’s the main thing.’ Southampton players look distraught after conceding against Sheffield United in the quarter-final .","Tottenham Hotspur host Sheffield United on Wednesday night .

"QPR striker Charlie Austin has been announced as the Barclays Premier League player of the month for December - the fifth forward in succession to land the award this season. The 25-year-old has been in inspired form for Harry Redknapp's side so far this season scoring 13 goals in all competitions - including five goals in as many games in December. That included goals against former side Burnley and Arsenal, as well as a match-winning hat-trick against relegation rivals West Brom at Loftus Road.

After receiving the award Austin spoke to QPR's official website underlining his delight. He said: 'To win awards like this is very pleasing.

"A wife who is standing by her teacher husband after he took a 16-year-old pupil's virginity in a school store cupboard has been suspended from her own job as acting headteacher amid complaints from parents. Religious studies teacher Stuart Kerner, 44, was spared jail despite being convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child after a judge controversially suggested the victim may have 'groomed him'. Kerner's wife, Katherine, is standing by him, but now worried mothers are pulling children out of the school where she works as an acting headteacher. Katherine Kerner (left), who is standing by her husband Stuart (right) after he took a 16-year-old pupil's virginity has been suspended from her own job as acting headteacher . Mrs Kerner, who took on the role at Wyborne Primary School, Greenwich, before Christmas but has now been placed on 'enforced leave', while council chiefs establish whether she should be allowed to continue working with children. Under the Childcare (Disqualification) Regulations 2009, a person can be banned from working with children aged under eight 'by association', if they live in the same household as another person who is disqualified lives or works. Father-of-one Kerner, who was vice principal at Bexleyheath Academy in south-east London, was banned from working with children and ordered to sign the sex offenders' register after he was convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust. Inner London Crown Court was told that Kerner took the then 16-year-old's virginity in a store cupboard the same week his wife miscarried and later had sex with her at his family home. His defence had tried to claim the victim had invented a fantasy relationship based on the novel Fifty Shades Of Grey, in which an older, more experienced man has an affair with a younger woman. Mrs Kerner took on the acting headteacher role at Wyborne Primary School, Greenwich (pictured), before Christmas but has now been placed on 'enforced leave', while council chiefs establish whether she should be allowed to continue working with children . Father-of-one Kerner, who was vice principal at Bexleyheath Academy in south-east London (pictured), was spared jail despite being convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust . He was cleared of four other charges of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust, and two counts of sexual activity with a child, which were said to have happened when the victim was 15. Judge Joanna Greenberg QC suspended his 18 month prison sentence, telling him: 'There is no evidence that you groomed her... It was she who groomed you and you gave in to temptation.' Mrs Kerner had sobbed as her husband had spared jail, as she had when the 'guilty' verdict was read out, causing her to flee from the court. 'She's destroyed our lives,' she had said of the victim. 'This is a miscarriage of justice, she's a liar'. Inner London Crown Court was told that Kerner (pictured) took the then 16-year-old's virginity in a store cupboard the same week his wife miscarried and later had sex with her at his family home . Edward Ellis, defending, had told sentencing hearing last week: 'Mrs Kerner herself is on enforced leave. 'It is highly likely she will have her position reviewed quite closely.' During the trial, Mr Ellis said of Mrs Kerner: 'She has been supporting her husband, the man she fell in love with 25 years ago. She gave him a son which Mr Kerner dotes on.' Kerner's guilty verdict was met with anger and fear by parents at Wyborne Primary, some of whom have applied for their children to be transferred to another school. Parent Pearl Louge, 23, told local paper News Shopper that she wanted to move her six-year-old daughter Remi-Leigh. 'I don't feel Mrs Kerner should be left to be working around children and she should not be allowed back at the school,' she said. 'What kind of message would it send out to keep her on?' Another parent, Charlotte Carter, 24, said her five-year-old son Frankee had been badly affected as his class teacher Gillian Efford has now had to take over as acting head in place of Mrs Kerner . 'Mrs Kerner should definitely not have been promoted to headteacher when she's living with a person who's been found guilty of sleeping with a pupil,' she said. 'I'm training to be a teaching assistant so I know anybody who lives with someone who has abused a young person should not be allowed to work with children.' A Greenwich Council spokesman told MailOnline: 'Safeguarding of children is a priority for us at all times, and all staff working in our schools are subject to full safeguarding checks in line with legislation and Ofsted guidance. 'It is not appropriate to comment on employment issues relating to any individual member of staff, and the criminal case referred to is not a matter for the council or the school to comment on. 'We encourage any parents who have concerns on behalf of their children to contact their school to discuss those concerns.'","Stuart Kerner, 44, was convicted of having sex with 16-year-old pupil .

"Manuel Pellegrini has been named the Premier League Manager of the Month for December after the Chilean guided Manchester City to five wins last month. The Premier League champions were unbeaten in the month of December and claimed 16 points from a possible 18 in the league. It was a run of form that helped City claw back eight-point deficit on league-leaders Chelsea to end 2014 within touching distance of the top of the table. Manuel Pellegrini wins Premier League Manager of the Month for December after winning five of six matches . Pellegrini's side picked up 16 points from a possible 18 in the month of December . Pellegrini had to do without star-man Sergio Aguero for the whole of the month . Sunderland 1-4 Manchester City . Manchester City 1-0 Everton . Leicester 0-1 Manchester City . Manchester City 3-0 Crystal Palace . West Brom 1-3 Manchester City . Manchester City 2-2 Burnley . Manchester City recorded away wins against Sunderland, Leicester and West Brom and beat Everton and Crystal Palace at the Etihad. The only blot on Pellegrini's copybook was a 2-2 home draw with relegation candidates Burnley after City threw away a two-goal lead in the final game of the year. That run of form is even more impressive considering Pellegrini had to deal with a spate of injuries that decimated his forward line, including an injury to star striker Sergio Aguero at the start of the month. Pellegrini's side clawed back eight-point deficit on Chelsea to leave them within touching distance at the top . Pellegrini gives rueful look after his side dropped points in the final game of December against Burnley .

"Liverpool and Chelsea meet on Tuesday evening in the first leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final, thus continuing a fierce modern rivalry that has thrown up many thrilling contests. There has been no shortage of controversial incidents in the last few years, from Luis Garcia's 'ghost goal' to Luis Suarez biting Branislav Ivanovic. And in the build-up to the match, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers admitted the rivalry is now so intense he can no longer be close friends with opposite number Jose Mourinho. But it's a match that doesn't quite compare to the great traditional rivalries of the British game, the ones akin to two tribes going to war. So with apologies to the good people of Sheffield, Bristol, Grimsby, Lincoln, Norwich, Ipswich, Watford, Luton, Wolverhampton, West Bromwich, Birmingham, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Dundee and Edinburgh, here's our rundown of the nation's bitterest football rivalries. The infamous moment when Luis Suarez bit Branislav Ivanovic during a Liverpool vs Chelsea game in 2013 . Steven Gerrard tries to wrestle the ball from Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho during last season's encounter . Celtic v Rangers . If there really is one rivalry in British football that genuinely is about more than sport then this it. Religion, national identity and history all play a part in what has become known as the Old Firm. The strength of feeling has certainly led to some remarkable scenes on the football pitch but, sadly, too many away from the action that we would rather forget. The Celtic vs Rangers rivalry in Glasgow is one that transcends football into politics, religion and society . Graham Roberts of Rangers smiles after grounding Celtic's Owen Archdeacon during a clash in 1987 . Celtic's Neil Lennon is confronted by four Rangers players during an Old Firm match in November 2004 . And Lennon the manager squares up to Rangers boss Ally McCoist after a game at Celtic Park in 2011 . A classic Old Firm punch-up in the goalmouth at Celtic Park during a league clash in April 2002 . Rangers striker El-Hadji Diouf confronts Celtic manager Neil Lennon during a Cup meeting in March 2011 . Manchester United v Liverpool . United – given their size, success and location – have more rivalries than they care to think about. Ask their supporters for their feelings about Manchester City and Leeds, for example, and stand back and prepare to listen. This is the only one that really counts, though. As Sir Alex Ferguson used to say: ‘Liverpool always have been, and always will be, our greatest rivals’. Music, culture, the Manchester Ship Canal. If there is an argument to be had about something, the citizens of these two great cities will have it. When it comes to football, however, the fundamentals remain the same. Years of chasing the same trophies and trying to buy the same players so that they could boast the same thing – ‘We are the best in Europe’ – have taken a deep toll. The rivalry is deep, it is real, it is bitter and it will never change. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard stands over Manchester United's Nani during a recent encounter . The Luis Suarez racism allegations against United's Patrice Evra is just one of many flashpoints . Nemanja Vidic gives Daniel Sturridge a piece of his mind during the Old Trafford meeting last season . Manchester United's Joe Jordan is on the receiving end of a flying kick from Liverpool keeper Ray Clemence . Burnley v Blackburn . Former Blackburn manager – and one-time Barcelona centre forward – Mark Hughes once described this rivalry as 'greater than that between Barcelona and Real Madrid'. From that point of view, it’s worth taking seriously and its credentials for respect are also hardened by the fact its England’s oldest derby, dating back to 1888. At first glance, both towns have much in common. They are only eight miles apart, both have been floored by the gradual erosion and decline of the north’s great industries and both – as a result – are patronised and ridiculed by the likes of nearby Manchester and Liverpool. Perhaps this is just it, though. When nobody else cares about you, what other option is there other than to care about each other? Burnley fans are held back by police and stewards after their 2005 FA Cup fifth-round tie with Blackburn . Blackburn's Marcus Bent is thrown to the floor as tempers flare in the Lancashire derby in 2000 . Newcastle v Sunderland . To many, it’s parochial and rather meaningless. After all, neither of these two clubs have won a meaningful trophy since Sunderland lifted the FA Cup almost 42 years ago. However, the mutual hatred between these two cities is another that transcends football. This one is about coal, politics and regional pride. If you don’t believe me then google ‘the Battle of Boldon Hill’ (it took place in 1644) and consider the fact that some people in Newcastle still refuse to eat bacon. Why? Because it’s red and white. Kind of. Players clash during the Tyne-Wear derby between Newcastle United and Sunderland in 2012 . Newcastle's Joey Barton trades blows with Sunderland's Phil Bardsley at the Stadium of Light in 2011 . Newcastle fans don't take too kindly to a home defeat by Sunderland in 2013 . Cardiff v Swansea . In 1988, having seen their team win in Swansea, a group of Cardiff fans were actually chased in to the sea by supporters of the home team. That fact, in itself, gives this rivalry a unique story to tell. Five years later, though, things grew a little more serious when Swansea fans tore seats from the stand at Ninian Park and began to throw them at their rivals. A pitch invasion followed and, as a result, away fans were banned from these games for several years. Interestingly, there is little history to this rivalry beyond football. In 1927, for example, many Swansea fans actually travelled to Wembley to cheer Cardiff on against Arsenal in the FA Cup Final. Things only got heated in the 1980s as football hooliganism began to take a grip of the UK. A heavy police presence at the Liberty Stadium keeps apart supporters of Swansea and Cardiff . Nottingham Forest v Derby County . Forest have their own neighbours, of course. You had probably hit a six iron from the centre circle of the City Ground and locate your ball in Notts County’ s car park a few minutes later. County, though, are not even on Forest’s radar when compared to their feelings with their other local foes from down the A52. Again there is a manufacturing argument at its roots – this time a row over the production of lace that goes back to the Industrial Revolution – but it was the great Brian Clough’s switch from Derby to Forest in the 1970s that really got this one off the ground. As events at Pride Park on Saturday showed, the hate goes on…. A Derby supporter runs onto the pitch to attack Nottingham Forest players after Saturday's match . Tottenham v Arsenal . The highest scoring derby in the Premier League, this one has its roots in geography, with the clubs’ stadia being just four miles apart. In recent times, people like George Graham and Sol Campbell have managed and played for both clubs, deepening the enmity. Many supporters won’t know, though, that the clubs have been arguing with each other since 1919 when Arsenal – rather than Tottenham - were voted in to an expanded First Division, despite finishing six places further down the old league structure. Players from Arsenal and Tottenham square up and White Hart Lane during their March 2013 meeting . Ian Wright gets into a scrap with Terry Fenwick during a heated North London derby in 1991 . Arsenal's Tommy Caton brings down a spectator invading the pitch at Highbury in 1985 . Some rather aggressive tackling from players of both teams during this 1968 League Cup clash at Highbury . Portsmouth v Southampton . Not surprisingly, given their coastal locations, this rivalry is predominantly about boats. Mutual dislike and suspicion between two ports located 30 miles apart has been around for centuries but historians pinpoint the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 as a key moment in time. Sailors from Southampton refused to crew her sister ship Olympic, due to the lack of lifeboats. Dockers from Portsmouth had no such issue, though, arriving in Southampton in the middle of the night to effectively take their work. When looked at like this, Harry Redknapp’s flitting between the two clubs ten years ago suddenly doesn't look like such a big deal. Portsmouth fans make their feelings known to Harry Redknapp after his switch to rivals Southampton . Riot police line up in front of the travelling fans as Portsmouth host Southampton at Fratton Park in 2004 . Chester v Wrexham . This one may now continue its life outside the Football League structure but on it goes, so much so that both sets of supporters still arrive at each other’s grounds on match day under heavy police escort. North Wales police actually claim that this fixture carries with it a greater risk of hooliganism than the Manchester derby. The fact that one of these towns is in England and the other is in Wales doesn’t help, of course….. Masses of police swarm in to separate fans of Chester and Wrexham during their meeting earlier this season . Millwall v West Ham . Back in the day the supporters of these clubs were largely dockers and ship yard workers competing for the same business on the same stretch of the Thames. So it was that the sporting – and often not very sporting – rivalry between Millwall Athletic and Thames Ironworks was born. When Millwall moved south of the river in 1910, the two clubs were no longer East End neighbours but the rivalry remained. In the 1960s and 1970s members of the criminal fraternity infiltrated the scene too. Occasionally some football was played.

"Emmanuel Adebayor was going through one of those unplayable phases around this time last year. The goals were flying in - eight in 10 games through January and February – there was a smile on his face and an infectious spirit in his football, which even tempted Tim Sherwood to join him in a trademark salute celebration at White Hart Lane. Sherwood, during six months at the helm, displayed great faith in Adebayor, showed him a little love and rescued him from the doldrums, where he often languishes, took advantage of the fact he wasn’t Andre Villas-Boas and the faith was repaid, with a total of 14 goals in 24 games. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mauricio Pochettino speaking ahead of Sheffield clash . Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor is likely to be handed a chance to shine against Sheffield United . Adebayor came off the subs' bench to appear against Sunderland at the weekend . Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino insists he has a good relationship with Adebayor . Emmanuel Adebayor was given permission by Tottenham to return to Africa for personal reasons on December 10. His return came just weeks after Adebayor accused family members of doing Juju on him. Read the full story HERE. AVB had frozen him out, infuriated by the striker’s attitude. Seldom can the fluctuations in form and focus of a player of his ability have been so extreme. When he’s good he’s very, very good and when he’s bad, he is utterly infuriating. Nine years since he came to England, signed by Arsenal from Monaco, that has always been the way. Is he fit? Great, what sort of mood is he in? Where’s his head at? Adebayor returned to the Tottenham team as a substitute in the 1-1 draw against Sunderland on Saturday. He was jeered on to the pitch by quite a few Spurs fans and contributed next to nothing after coming on. Football supporters will tolerate plenty if they can see effort and commitment (see Roberto Soldado) but they are entitled to question those they feel are swinging the lead, especially if they happen to be the club’s top earner on £100,000 a week. Since his last start, at Aston Villa, there have been vague but minor injuries and illnesses and he was given compassionate leave to visit Africa amid stories of witchcraft surrounding his family. As ever, there have been few specifics from Pochettino, who has managed the situation with great care, saying as little as possible in public despite a barrage of questions. The 30-year-old shared a good relationship with former White Hart Lane boss Tim Sherwood . Adebayor, pictured with his mum, was allowed to return to Africa to deal with personal problems in December . Adebayor insists that his personal problems are behind him, that his head is in the right place once again. He is in the squad to face Sheffield United in the first leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final and may even start his first game since November 2. It is a shrewd move by Pochettino, who really could do with the sort of mid-season boost to his striking options that Adebayor provided last year. It would ease the burden on Harry Kane and relieve some of the pressure in the transfer market. Sheffield United, from League One, have made a habit of surprising opponents from the Barclays Premier League in cup competitions over the last 18 months and will be backed by strong support from their travelling fans but Spurs, with only one defeat in 10, will expect to beat them. Michel Vorm appears set to start in goal and Nacer Chadli is missing due to the death of his father Ramdan after a long illness but Pochettino is expected to select a strong team in the first of three cup ties in a week. If Adebayor does not start against the Blades, his chance may come against Leicester in the FA Cup on Saturday. The 30-year-old Togo international, who has not scored since October and out of contract next year, is firmly back in the frame, with a final chance to rescue his Tottenham career by helping them towards Wembley. And he is quite capable of rising to the challenge. Michel Vorm is likely to be given the nod to start against Sheffield United after impressing in previous rounds .","Emmanuel Adebayor is in contention to start against Sheffield United .

"Lionel Messi scored his 30th hat-trick for Barcelona ad his 22nd in La Liga during their 4-0 win over Deportivo on Sunday night. The treble made him only the second player in history to reach 30 hat-tricks for a Spanish team after Telmo Zarra. It also meant he moved to 19 goals in 19 games as Barcelona reached the halfway point of the season in good form. After recent rows between Barca coach Luis Enrique and senior players it was perhaps not insignficant that after picking 28 different team line-ups, the Catalans' boss finally repeated an 11. It wasn’t just any 11 - iit was the one most supporters believe is his best and they delivered a performance to justify their selection. Bara almost scored from a corner on nine minutes when Ivan Rakitic rolled the kicked to Messi and his first time shot was tipped over by Fabricio. The pair combined again on 10 minutes and this time the move ended with Barcelona taking the lead.

Goals: Messi (10, 33, 62), Sidnei OG (83) Bookings: Bartra, Alvesv . Sergio Busuets found the Croatian and his cross was headed home by Messi who had escaped the attention of his marker Juan Dominguez. It was his 17th of the season in La Liga. Messi tracked back to rob Haris Medunjanin in the right-back position and the goalscorer’s workrate set the tone for the rest of team. This was almost the old Barca hunting down the ball and giving Deportivo no time in possession. Luis Suarez was back on the stadium he had played on 10 years earlier for Uruguayan side Nacional on a European tour. He might have scored when put through by Andres Iniesta but the flag was raised in error as the former Liverpool forward took aim. Barcelona were enjoying 74 per cent of possession but Ivan Cavaleiro had Deportivo’s first chance at the other end after Pique missed his kick trying to clear. The striker snatched at the chance and bent his shot well wide. The chance gave Deportivo confidence and, with Busquets sloppy in possession, on several occasions the home side crept into the game. Suarez chased back to win the ball on the edge of his own area and set Messi away but the Argentine ran into trouble. Barca’s front three were doing their best to lead from the front and on 32 minutes they combined to make it 2-0. Neymar crossed from the left, there was a touch from Suarez and when the ball ran into Messi’s path he scored his 18th goal of the season to make it 2-0. He nearly completed a first-half hat-trick when he shaved the bar after receiving a Busquets pass.

It was another brilliant goal made to look so easy by Messi who walked off with the match ball at the end of the game, for the 30th time in his career. Barcelona didn’t need any help but Deportivo scored the visitors' fourth for them. Dani Alves crossed from the right and, when Lopo tried to clear, the ball hit Sidnei and cannoned past Fabricio for 4-0. Suarez twisted and turned away from two Deportivo defenders in injury time but was denied by Fabricio and he then just failed to connect with Rakitic's cross as Barcelona tried in vain to find the fifth.

"Bolton Wanderers have issued a statement in response to a private fraud and perjury prosecution by football agent Tony McGill. As reported in Charles Sale’s Agenda column, the agent has filed allegations against the club and chairman Phil Gartside in a private prosecution that is due to be heard at Newcastle Magistrates Court. The statement, released on the club’s website, says Mr McGill is trying to resurrect an issue that has already been settled in court. Allegations of fraud and perjury have been made against Bolton Wanderers chairman Phil Gartside . The hearings in a criminal court follow a civil case at Manchester Civil Justice Centre last year. McGill brought the case against Gartside, Bolton Wanderers and seven other defendants. The case related to the 2007 transfer of Gavin McCann from Aston Villa to Wanderers, which McGill alleged he was cut out of by Wanderers and agency Sports and Entertainment Media Group (SEM). The judge ruled against McGill in the civil case. McCann, who also played for Sunderland and Everton, Southampton assistant coach Sammy Lee and Gartside are among nine people who have been summonsed. The statement read: ‘The current allegations appear to be another attempt by Mr McGill to use the court process to resurrect a matter that has already been judicially determined. As of yet full details of the current allegations have not been provided by the prosecutor Mr McGill, who appears to be handling the case personally by way of a private prosecution, but the club understands that the current allegations relate to the same set of commercial circumstances back in 2007 which were widely reported last year and which were found to have no legal merit. The club, its officers and past employees have always strenuously rejected all claims by Mr McGill of any wrongdoing. Tony McGill's allegations surround the 2007 transfer of Gavin McCann (centre) from Aston Villa . The club and its officers/employees were completely vindicated by the prior civil court proceedings and further to this the claimant was refused permission to appeal by the trial judge. The claimant has renewed his application for permission to appeal against certain of the club’s former co-defendants (related to the football agency SEM) but is not pursuing an appeal against the club or any of its (former) officers/employees. In 2013 our lawyers made an application to strike out the claimant’s then claims and were substantially successful as a number of the allegations were found to have no reasonable grounds. As a result, a costs award was made in the club’s favour and, following non-payment by the claimant, a statutory demand for those costs was raised. The remainder of the claimant’s claims (as amended) were heard at trial in Manchester in 2014 where they were dismissed in their entirety and a further costs order was made in favour of the defendants. Again, following non-payment, a further statutory demand was raised. New manager Neil Lennon (2nd right) has guided the side to 14th place in the Championship table . Last week an application by Mr McGill to set aside the two statutory demands was dismissed and a further costs award was made in favour of the club. Mr McGill has so far failed to satisfy the statutory demands and further actions to recover the costs will now be taken. The club believes that these further allegations are malicious and vexatious and will defend accordingly.’","Tony McGill has filed allegations against Bolton and chairman Phil Gartside .

"As Gary Rowett continues to lead a united Birmingham City side up the Championship table, the boardroom battle at the club’s owning company intensifies. A week after it was revealed imprisoned owner Carson Yeung is trying to oust three directors to appoint replacements of his choosing, including his common law partner and bodyguard, Birmingham International Holdings (BIHL) announced it believes a former employee may have misappropriated funds amounting to £2.5million. While these developments bear little immediate impact on the pitch – indeed Rowett has been able to sign Lloyd Dyer to boost his squad – the escalation of disharmony in Hong Kong could eventually prove deeply undermining. Imprisoned Birmingham owner Carson Yeung plans to make changes to the Championship side's board . Yeung is hoping to add his common law partner and bodyguard to the Birmingham board . Birmingham owner Yeung was jailed for six years in March 2014 for money laundering . It is with this uncertainty swirling, that fans of any hue would be wise to keep track, and read Haircuts and League Cups: The Rise and Fall of Carson Yeung. Written by Daniel Ivery, author of the well-informed Often Partisan blog, and Will Giles, a lawyer based in Hong Kong, the book provides context, fine detail, and measured story-telling to chart the story of Yeung’s life and involvement with Birmingham. In an age when investors and shysters of different shapes and sizes converge on English football, the forensic attention given by Ivery and Giles to the Yeung story, from hairdresser to high-stakes gambler, is worth absorbing. A measure of the content can be found by the reaction drawn from Peter Pannu, Birmingham’s one-time chief executive and long-term Yeung confidant. In December he sent Ivery messages that used physical intimidation and appeared to threaten legal action. More seriously for Birmingham, he alleged the club could be out of business by January over a £1.8m tax bill. Birmingham, led by director Panos Pavlakis, issued a statement firmly denying the claims, adding: ‘All involved at the club are wholly unimpressed and saddened by the unprofessional and ludicrous actions taken which seem intent on discrediting and damaging individuals and the club.’ Birmingham manager Gary Rowett has helped his side climb the Championship table . Former Burton Albion boss Rowett took over the reins at St Andrews in October . Shares in BIHL were suspended from trading, and Pannu resigned as a club director. He lost his place on the BIHL board too – but at the AGM a fortnight ago he was re-elected, with Pavlakis ousted, thanks mainly to votes cast by Yeung from behind bars in Stanley Prison. The next day, however, Pavlakis – whose place at the helm of Birmingham had looked in doubt – was re-appointed with a deciding vote from BIHL chairman Cheung Shing. Status quo restored. Such boardroom battles have been frequent since Yeung’s arrest in June 2011 – and are much documented in Haircuts and League Cups. In riposte the news followed that Yeung, who remains the largest shareholder in company and club, wants to call an EGM at BIHL and appoint three associates to the board. Lloyd Dyer has joined Birmingham on loan for the rest of the season . Pavlakis and his faction are eager that the credentials of the individuals satisfy Hong Kong Stock Exchange rules before an EGM is held; doing things by the book. In the same approach, the company reported the discovery of £2.5m misappropriated funds to police, concerned too that auditors had missed the loss. On Tuesday afternoon, Ivery reported on his Often Partisan website that a 33-year-old, believed to be Jerry Ko – a former compliance officer – has been arrested. Events in the Far East may feel a long distance away, but they could bring trouble closer to St Andrew’s as the Football League monitors Yeung’s influence. If the 54-year-old continues to exert power at BIHL and force through changes, the knock-on effect might be a shake-up in the Birmingham boardroom. From that stage, any suspicion Yeung is able to act as a shadow director, against the governing body’s rules given his money-laudering conviction, could lead to severe sanctions: transfer embargoes, point deductions, or, most damagingly, a ban from the Football League completely. That eventuality would be extreme and is far from probable. But choppy waters may lie ahead for Rowett, who has steered a smooth ship against the odds so far.","Imprisoned owner Carson Yeung wants to make changes to board .
He wants to appoint his common law partner and personal bodyguard .

"The most shocking statistic in Lleyton Hewitt's long and distinguished career is that he is only 33 years old, because it's like he's been around forever. At just 15 years of age, Hewitt was the youngest qualifier in the history of the Australian Open in 1997. But as he prepares for his 50th match at the tournament, there are no shortage of young Australian players looking to take his place. 18 years ago his opponent was the world number 64 player Sergi Bruguera of Spain who beat the Australian in straight sets 6-3, 6-4, 6-3. Bruguera has been retired for 13 years now and is currently the coach of France’s Richard Gasquet. Scroll down for video .

For most of his career Hewitt would make this sign after winning an important point during a match . Reflecting back on his debut, Hewitt said: ‘I wouldn’t have dreamt of that as my first one in ’97 as a 15-year-old, that’s for sure. I didn’t think I’d be playing anywhere near 30.’ Well he is. And after beating China’s Zhang Ze in the first round he‘ll now face Germany’s Benjamin Becker in the second round on Thursday. Just for some more context Hewitt is one of the last remaining players on tour to have played against Benjamin’s namesake Boris Becker. Hewitt was beaten in straight sets by Boris at Wimbledon in 1999. Today’s Australian stars are babes in the wood in comparison. But this year fellow Australians Nick Kyrgios, Thanasi Kokkinakis, Bernard Tomic, Marinko Matosevic, Sam Groth and James Duckworth all made it into the second round as well. A young Thanasi Kokkinakis can only dream of playing in the Australian Open at this age . Nick Kyrgios (left) shows that cheeky grin as a kid that he shows his opponents on court today . Kokkinakis was just nine months old when Hewitt played his first Australian Open match on January 13, 1997. Kyrgios was 21 months old, while Tomic was nearly five. Now that he's in the twilight of his career Hewitt knows it's time for them to step up. ‘I think for the most part those three guys - obviously Tomic, Kyrgios and Kokkinakis - they have big futures,’ he told Fox Sports. ‘All three guys like playing on the big stage, which is really important. ‘I’ve seen that in Davis Cup now. It doesn’t get much more pressure than playing Davis Cup, where you’re playing for your country and your team mates as well as yourself. ‘It hasn’t really surprised me the last couple of days.

Fox Sports reported that since 1997 Hewitt has faced off against opponents from 23 countries at the Australian Open. In 1997 the Rod Laver Arena was still three years away from being renamed, while Hisense and Margaret Court Arenas didn’t even exist in their current form. The nearest he got to winning the competition was in 2005 when he was beaten by Russia’s Marat Safin 1-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 in the final. Since Hewitt made his Australian Open debut in 1997, the first iPhone was more than ten years away from going on sale, while Facebook and Twitter were not invented for another seven and nine years respectively. Hewitt's famed on-court ferocity is in contrast to his quiet demeanour off it however. But this did not stop him becoming one of Australia's most famous celebrity couples. In 2005 he tied the knot with Rebecca Cartwright who was famous for playing Hayley Smith Lawson on the soap opera Home and Away.

The couple has three children together - Mila, eight, Cruz, five, and Ava, three - and now see their Caribbean haven as home, despite still owning some property in Australia. He is a devout Adelaide Crows fan and his sporting hero is Tyson Edwards of the Crows. The Tennis Australia website said that his good friends are golfers Greg Norman and Aaron Baddeley, and he even caddied for Greg Norman at Australian PGA event.

The 33-year-old celebrates in familiar style after winning a point against Ze in their first round match on Tuesday night .

Despite the Aussie young guns lining up to replace him, no one would bet against Hewitt making a 20th appearance at the Australian Open next year.

"An entire family of small frogs found on the coast of South America is thought to have been wiped out by a deadly amphibian disease. The Darwin's frog, and its cousin the Chile Darwin's frog, have not been spotted for months and scientists from Chile and Britain believe they are now extinct. The disease is called chytridiomycosis and the claims have been made by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Universidad Andris Bello (UNAB). An entire family of small frogs found on the coast of South America is thought to have been wiped out by a deadly amphibian disease. The Darwin's frog and its cousin the Chile Darwin's frog, pictured, have not been spotted for months and scientists believe they are now extinct . Darwin's frog and its cousin the Chile Darwin's frog are both named after . naturalist and evolutionist Charles Darwin. As its name suggests, the Chile Darwin's frog is endemic to Chile, while its cousin was also found in Argentina. Darwin first discovered the Rhinodermatidae darwinii species in 1834 in south Chile . during his voyage around the globe. The species have a distinct appearance, having evolved to look like a leaf, with a pointy nose. Darwin's frogs are small, reaching a size of only 3cm in length. Professor Andrew Cunningham from ZSL's Institute of Zoology said: ‘Only a few examples of the 'extinction by infection' phenomenon exist. ‘Although not entirely conclusive, the possibility of chytridiomycosis being associated with the extinction of the northern Darwin's frog gains further support with this study.’ The scientists claim the plummeting numbers and the disappearance of the creatures from most of their territory across Chile and Argentina cannot be explained by habitat loss alone. Hundreds of specimens of Darwin's frogs and other amphibians from similar habitats were collected between 1835 and 1989. Each were tested in order to find DNA pieces of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a fungus that causes the disease chytridiomycosis. Scientists claim the plummeting numbers of the Darwin's frog, pictured, and the disappearance of the creatures from most of their territory across Chile and Argentina cannot be explained by habitat loss alone. The disease is called chytridiomycosis and comes from a fungus called Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) In addition, 26 populations of Darwin's frogs were surveyed in Chile and Argentina between 2008 and 2012 for the presence of Bd. Research leader Dr. Claudio . Soto-Azat, from UNAB and former ZSL PhD student said: ‘Amphibians have . inhabited the earth for 365 million years, far longer than mammals. ‘We may have already lost one species, the northern Darwin's frog, but we cannot risk losing the other one. There is still time to protect this incredible species. ‘Amphibians provide an important ecosystem service by maintaining balance in the environment. Without them insect plagues and their subsequent effect on agriculture and public health would be more frequent. ‘ZSL scientists are working to further understand the reasons behind the extinction of Darwin's frogs, and ensure the long-term survival of the species.’ Darwin's frog and its cousin the Chile Darwin's frog are both named after naturalist and evolutionist Charles Darwin.

"In yet another twist to the mystery, a homeless man has come forward claiming he knows where Robert Allenby was for the two and a half hours that the golfer says he can't recall following his alleged abduction. Toa Kaili says he stumbled across the pro golfer passed out on a sidewalk  in Waikiki, in Hawaii, at 11pm on Saturday and when he and his friend tried to help Allenby he accused them of stealing his wallet and phone. About two hours later, Mr Kaili says he returned  to find the golfer still unconscious on the pavement but now with a bloodied face – the man claims the Australian was injured from falling over and hitting his head on a rock. Scroll down for video . Toa Kaili claims that he found Robert Allenby passed out on the pavement before he and a friend woke the golfer who accused them of stealing his wallet and phone . Allenby says he can't recall two and a half hours after he was abducted, robbed and dumped in a park . 'Then he’s accusing me and my friend ""you guys stole my wallet and phone – alright the gig is up just hand it over"" so I was like ""brother we are the ones who woke you up - we are the ones just helping you,' Mr Kaili told Channel 9 News. 'He was saying 'you don’t know who I am"".' Although Mr Kaili denies stealing Allenby's possessions - someone has been having a fine time with the golfer's credit card. Honolulu detectives are following the spending spree on Robert Allenby's stolen credit card, as they try to solve the mystery surrounding his alleged abduction last week. Investigators have also been door-knocking businesses throughout the city for video surveillance footage that might help them piece together what happened to the Australian golfer on the night he was bashed and robbed. 'Detectives are reviewing witness statements and gathering security video footage,' Michelle Yu of the Honolulu Police Department said. 'They are also looking into recent charges made on Mr Allenby’s credit card. No arrest has been made.' The new witness says when he returned two hours later Allenby was still unconscious but with a bloodied face from hitting his head on a rock and accused them again of robbing his possessions . Four days have passed since Robert Allenby's attack. As yet local police have made no arrests and are still seeking more surveillance video to help with their investigation. Authorities believe the spending spree on his stolen credit card is their best chance of an arrest . Robert Allenby is disputing reports regarding conflicting details provided by a female witness to the aftermath of his alleged kidnapping, robbery and bashing on Saturday morning. He said the injuries he suffered are proof . An emotional reunion. Robert Allenby meets the homeless woman, now identified as Charade Keane, at the park in Honolulu where she came to his aid at the weekend . 'Thank you for looking after me,' Allenby said to Ms Keane when they were reunited . 'It’s such a shame that people are focusing on whether the story is true,' Robert Allenby is believed to have said in text messages to the Golf Channel. 'I say you only have to look at me to see the truth.' 'Detectives have opened second degree robbery and fraudulent use of credit card investigations,' Ms Yu added. 'That means we investigate it as a felony rather than a misdemeanour. ''Second degree robbery is punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment; fraudulent use of credit cards is punishable by up to five years.' But other CCTV is being sought from the strip around the wine bar where Allenby was last seen. 'The (extra) video will be very helpful,' Honolulu Police Department Captain Rade Vanic said. Staff at the wine bar in which Allenby, 43, was last seen at about 11pm on Friday said 'we can't say anything about that', when contacted by Daily Mail Australia and asked if they had seen anything untoward on the night. With varying stories from Allenby and Charade Keane, the woman who helped the dazed and bruised Australian in the early hours on Saturday morning, detectives are trying to reconstruct the incident. They are believed to be already in possession of vision which shows Allenby leaving the Amuse Wine Bar at about 11pm on the Friday, with two, as yet unidentified men, and a woman. And more CCTV footage of two men buying alcohol, apparently with the golfer's credit card, has been taken from a store at Waikiki. Allenby said he couldn't remember much in the hours after being assaulted and robbed. Capt Vanic said not only were detectives attempting to find more surveillance footage of what Allenby described as a Hollywood-style attack and kidnapping, but they were now seeking video from stores where the culprits might have used his stolen credit cards. Police said they could publicly release video of suspects in the hope of identifying the thieves. 'We do have video from various retail establishments, so we are looking into it,' Capt Vanic said. 'Of course, if it does show individuals who are possible suspects, we will do our best to identify them and may even put it out with our Crime Stoppers information. 'But it is still very early on in our investigation.' Capt Vanic said Keane gave police a statement and they would interview her again if needed. Ms Keane 'dragged' Allenby to safety as he was arguing with two men in the park telling him 'you have to leave or they will kill you' The spot where Allenby was found 'dazed and confused'. 'Honolulu Police say 'we do have video from various retail establishments, so we are looking into it' The Amuse Wine Bar in Honolulu where Allenby was dining with friends before being bashed and robbed . The Amuse Wine Bar is inside the Honolulu Design Centre. It's where Allenby and friends were before the golfer was beaten and robbed . Robert Allenby missed the cut at the Sony Golf Open in Honolulu . Allenby was drinking with friends at the upmarket Amuse Wine Bar in Waikiki on Friday night and believed he was drugged, bashed in the face with a fist or baseball bat, tossed in the boot of a car, robbed and then dumped in a park 10 kilometres away. The drama began when Allenby was separated from his friends in the bar, caddie Mick Middlemo and Anthony Puntoriero. 'I didn't think I was going to survive this one,' Allenby said. 'I was separated from my friend in the bar after we had paid the tab at 10:48pm and he went to the bathroom and next thing you know I'm being dumped in a park miles away. 'I only know this part because a homeless woman found me and told me she saw a few guys pull up and throw me out of the car. 'That is where I got the scrapes above my eye, from the side-walk.' The homeless woman he referred to is believed to be Ms Keane, who said she found and helped Allenby a short distance away from the bar, perhaps 50 metres down the road, at about 1.30am - some two and a half hours after he disappeared. An image of the intersection where Charade Keane found Robert Allenby slumped in the gutter, bashed and trying to fend off two men . Australian golfer Robert Allenby was bloodied and bruised and without his wallet and phone before being placed in a taxi back to the Kahala Hotel by two good Samaritans, an ex-military officer and Charade Keane . The confusion over what happened to Robert Allenby includes his belief that he was found two and a half hours after he left his friends and some 10 kilometres away from where he was dining and Charade Keane's claim that it was just 50 metres from the Amuse Wine Bar . Bizarrely Allenby had an emotional reunion with the homeless woman, just hours after he accused her of being paid to spread false stories about what happened that night. The golfer embraced and kissed Ms Keane, as they greeted each other back at the spot where she said they first met, across the road from the Amuse Wine Bar in Waikiki on Saturday morning. 'I really appreciate what you did,' Allenby told her. The reunion came a few hours after the multi-millionaire pro-golfer reportedly speculated in text messages to Golf Central that Keane was was 'getting paid' to relay details of the incident to the media. Capt Vanic said robberies similar to the way Allenby described were not common in Honolulu, a popular destination for tourists from Australia and around the world. 'Honolulu is a big city and there are tourists who, unfortunately, are victims of a crime, but it is not something that happens very frequently in Honolulu,' Capt Vanic added. Allenby was in Hawaii to compete in the PGA Tour's Sony Open, but missed the halfway cut on Friday. Allenby, whose face was badly cut and bruised, announced on Tuesday he would not play in this week's PGA Humana Challenge event in La Quinta, California, on the advice of his doctor. 'This will enable me to ensure I am fully recovered prior to rejoining the PGA Tour,' he added .

"Researchers have made an exact copy of a dinosaur fossil covered in plaster - without having to crack open its protective case. The technique, which uses a CT scanner and 3D printer, could help scientists analyse fossils in casings without risking damage to it in the process. Scientists also hope the method will allow scientists to share replicas of fossils that are too delicate to be passed around. Researchers have made an exact copy, pictured right, of a dinosaur fossil covered in plaster - without having to crack open its protective case, pictured left. The technique, which uses a CT scanner and 3D printer, could help scientists analyse fossils in casings without risking damage to it in the process . Researchers performed CT scans on the unidentified fossil with a 320-slice multi-detector system. The . different absorption of radiation through the bone compared with the . surrounding material provided a clear image of a fossilised vertebral . body. The CT study also provided valuable information about the condition of the fossil, showing multiple fractures. It . helped the researchers build an accurate reconstruction of the fossil . with selective laser sintering - a technology that uses a high-powered . laser to fuse together materials to make a 3D object. Fossils are often stored in plaster casts, or jackets, to protect them from damage. Getting information about a fossil often means breaking the plaster open, which can damage or destroy the fossil itself. German researchers studied the feasibility of using CT and 3D printers to non-destructively separate fossilised bone from its surrounding material and produce a 3D print of the bone. ‘The most important benefit of this method is that it is non-destructive, and the risk of harming the fossil is minimal,’ said Dr Ahi Sema Issever, from the Charité Campus Mitte in Berlin. Dr Issever and colleagues applied the . method to an unidentified fossil from the Museum für Naturkunde, a . major natural history museum in Berlin. The fossil and others like it were buried under rubble in the basement of the museum after a World War II bombing raid. Researchers performed CT scans on the unidentified fossil using a 320-slice multi-detector system. The different absorption of radiation through the bone compared with the surrounding material provided a clear image needed to make the copy, pictured . But museum staff had difficulty identifying some of the plaster jackets. Researchers performed CT on the unidentified fossil with a 320-slice multi-detector system. The different absorption of radiation through the bone compared with the surrounding material provides a clear image of a fossilised vertebral body. After studying the CT scan and comparing it to old excavation drawings, the researchers were able to trace the fossil's origin to the excavation, a major dig from 1910 to 1927 in a clay pit south of Halberstadt, Germany.

"Muammar Gaddafi has escaped in a state-of-the-art armoured vehicle provided by Nicolas Sarkozy, it emerged today. In the latest extraordinary twist to the Libyan rebellion, it emerged that the French President gave the ‘green light’ to the Arab dictator receiving the £3.5 million converted Mercedes 4x4 in 2008. Not only is it filled with communications systems capable of keeping Gaddafi in touch with his forces, but it can foil the kind of tracking systems used by the military as they try to hunt him down. Stealthy and bulletproof: A road-going Mercedes ML, the type which has been modified with armour plating and jamming technology, and allegedly given to Muammar Gaddafi by France . It was Mr Sarkozy who ordered French jets to start bombing Gaddafi’s . forces back in March, and last week he and Prime Minister David Cameron . enjoyed a triumphant trip to the newly liberated Tripoli. But investigative news site Mediapart has found documents proving that French technology firm Amesys was allowed to provide Gaddafi with the command vehicle. The revelation comes on the day that . pro-Gaddafi fighters fired anti-aircraft guns at revolutionary forces . holding the northern gate of Bani Walid for a second day, as frustration with weeks of halting advances grows among the former rebel ranks. Launching an attack: Libyan rebel fighters fire rockets as they press forward near Ouagadougou Conference Center in the outskirts of Sirte. A second front has reportedly opened up in the city's east . Weapons salvage: Anti-Gaddafi forces sift through the abandoned weapons in Sirte, taking what they can use and destroying everything left behind. Fighting remains fierce in Gaddafi's remaining strongholds . Ragtag front line: Revolutionary forces have pulled back from Bani Walid, leaving a thin front of mainly young fighters with little experience or support . Forces - no longer rebels but the military of the National Transitional Council, Libya's interim government . - have been massed outside Bani Walid since shortly after Libya's new . rulers gained control of Tripoli and other parts of the country in . August. Block-by-block fighting continues in Gaddafi's home town of Sirte, with revolutionary forces claiming to have opened a second front in the east of the city. Of Sarkozy's armoured 4x4, Mediapart says: ‘In 2007 the sale was approved by the then Interior Minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, and his chief of staff Claude Gueant. Gadhafi spokesman Moussa Ibrahim has . told the Syrian Al-Rai TV station, the Gaddafi media mouthpiece, that 17 . mercenaries from Britain, France and Qatar had been captured near Bani . Walid. Britain's Foreign Office said it was aware of Mr Ibrahim's claims, but had no evidence that they were correct. Mr . Ibrahim said: 'A group was captured in Bani Walid consisting of 17 . mercenaries. They are technical experts and they include consultative . officers. Most of them are French, one of them is from an Asian country that has not been identified, two English people and one Qatari.' The . French foreign ministry said it had no information about the report. Qatari officials were not immediately available for comment. ‘The vehicle was eventually delivered in 2008 - this time with the green light from the President.’ The site goes on to give details of . the armoured 4X4 Mercedes ML - equipped with a protection cage made by . Faraday, which prevents all electronic fields from affecting the . vehicle. It also comes . with an electronic device capable of knocking out all radio frequencies . within some 300ft of the vehicle. This would make the kind of targeted bombing, which has seen hundreds of . Libyan Army vehicles destroyed over the past six months, almost . impossible. A military . source in Paris said: ‘Gaddafi has almost certainly used the vehicle to . get away. It is a product of superb French engineering, and an obvious . means of escape. ‘Gaddafi would be able to stay out . sight of military targeters, and be extremely well protected if he met . enemy forces on the ground.’ In . a further disastrous revelation for Mr Sarkozy, it emerged that the 4X4 . was part of a £25million-plus deal that also saw the French  provide . Libya with the means to conduct email surveillance over their own . people. The deal was . put together by the French-Lebanese arms dealer Ziad Takieddine,  which . is at the centre of a party-funding scandal involving Mr Sarkozy. The scandal, known in France as ‘Karachigate’, is linked to the selling of submarines to Pakistan. The . unidentified military source added: ‘All of this is disastrous for Mr . Sarkozy. On one hand he is presenting himself as the saviour of Libya, . while in reality he did more to keep Gaddafi in arms than almost anybody . else.’ PR disaster: Revelations that Nicolas Sarkozy essentially gave Muammar Gaddafi the means of his escape from capture will be a major embarrassment for the French President. Both men are seen here in a 2007 photo . Sherpa, a . French Internet watchdog group, last week filed a complaint against . Amesys for selling equipment to Gaddafi designed ‘to track rebel . forces’. An Elysee Palace spokesman said: ‘We have no comment to make on any of this.’ Today . trained fighters pulled away from Bani Walid to regroup and reinforce . for a new assault, after they were heavily beaten in the city Friday. Gaddafi forces opened up on the bands of ragtag, undisciplined fighters left on on the front line. These . include fighters as young as 18 who spend hours smoking hash, shooting . at plastic bottles, arguing with one another and sometimes just firing . wildly into the streets out of apparent boredom. Slow but steady progress: Anti-Gaddafi fighters advance to bomb an area where they exchange fire with Gaddafi loyalists near Herawa, 32 miles east of Sirte . Victory is in the air: As Libyan fighters chant slogans, after taking control of Gaddafi strongholds in the desert south of Tripoli, there remains the feeling that revolutionary forces will slowly but surely triumph . Fighting is raging at Sirte, Gaddafi's hometown on the Mediterranean coast. The regime stronghold of Sabha lies hundreds of miles away in the southern deserts, and there are others deep in the central deserts like the cities of Houn and Zallah. Revolutionaries involved in the battle at Sirte are more organised but have have made slow progress. Today revolutionary forces shelled the city with Grad rockets and the sound of gunfights echoed through the streets. White smoke wafted over the city, and civilians continued to flee. Gaddafi forces answered back with occasional Katyusha rockets. Regular truckloads of fuel and food arrive from Misrata to keep the fighters supplied outside Sirte. In the past three days, they have battled block-by-block into the western side of Sirte, along the beach and along a eucalyptus tree-lined main avenue parallel to the coast.",Loyalist fighters hold out for second day in Bani Walid .
"The BUK surface-to-air missile system believed to have shot down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 is an old Soviet-built weapon designed to engage aircraft, cruise missiles and drones that is still widely used in eastern European states, including Ukraine. They are capable of taking down aircraft the size of a Boeing 777 flying at a cruising altitude of 33,000 feet, meaning the intensity of the impact is likely to have blown the plane apart in the sky. Witnesses says wreckage and body parts of the passengers and crew are scattered over an area of around nine miles, reinforcing the idea that the plane broke up mid-air. Scroll down for video . BUK missile launchers are capable of taking down aircraft the size of a Boeing 777 flying at a cruising altitude of 33,000 feet, meaning the impact is likely to have blown the plane apart in the sky . BUK missile systems have large self-propelled launchers that use radar to engage aircraft or missiles up to an altitude of 75,000 feet. A launcher similar to the BUK missile system was seen earlier today by journalists near the eastern town of Snizhne, which is held by pro-Russia rebels. The BUK, developed by the Soviet Union in 1979, has remained widely in use throughout the former Soviet states, including Ukraine. Until then it was assumed the only surface-to-air missiles in rebel hands were shoulder-held launchers with a maximum engagement range of 10,000 feet. In a statement Donetsk separatist leader Andrei Purgin said that he was certain that Ukrainian troops had shot it down but gave no explanation for that statement. Purgin said he was not aware of whether rebel forces owned BUK missile launchers, but even if they did, there had no fighters capable of operating it. Down: Smoke billows into the sky after a Malaysia Airlines passenger plane was shot out of the sky at 33,000ft over eastern Ukraine, killing all 295 people on board . The Ukrainian authorities have laid the blame for the attack on the rebels by denying any responsibility for the missile launch. Flight . MH17, which was carrying 280 passengers and 15 crew, was flying between . Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur after taking off at lunchtime today. TV pictures from the scene showed a pall of smoke billowing into the sky near Donetsk, apparently from the stricken aircraft. Earlier, pro-Russia rebels claimed responsibility for surface-to-air missile on two Ukrainian Sukhoi-25 jets yesterday. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said the second jet was hit by a portable surface-to-air missile - not a BUK - adding that the pilot was unscathed and managed to land his plane safely.","BUK surface-to-air launchers designed to engage aircraft and cruise missiles .

"The quality of life in Britain is the worst in Europe – lower even than Poland, because of crime, violence and the high cost of living. A study puts the UK at the bottom of a league of ten nations, even though some of them have much lower incomes. Households in countries such as Poland, France, Spain and Italy all have less material wealth but are considerably happier with life. Only 5 per cent of Britons describe themselves as happy, while 10 per cent would like to emigrate. The league is based on 16 factors including net income, VAT, the cost of essential goods such as fuel, food and energy, as well as lifestyle considerations such as hours of sunshine, holiday entitlement, working hours and life expectancy. ‘Long working hours, the lowest number of days holiday a year and a high retirement age paint a bleak picture for those in the UK,’ said the uSwitch.com price comparison website, which carried out the study. ‘We also suffer the most expensive food and diesel prices along with higher-than-average petrol costs, while enjoying almost the lowest amount of sunshine.’ The good life: Polish city Warsaw. The average retirement age in Poland is 59, four years lower than in Britain. Workers also have ten days more holiday . Beautiful, but 'broken': London's Southbank. 59 per cent of those polled were worried about a breakdown in society, demonstrated by the summer's riots . Some 59 per cent of those polled were worried about a ‘broken society’, as demonstrated by the summer riots in many towns and cities. Forty-nine per cent listed the rising cost of living as a burden, while 47 per cent were worried about the levels of crime and violence. UK average net household income is put at £38,547, well ahead of the £31,767 in France, £25,601 in Italy, £23,398 in Spain and just £8,759 in Poland. However, the quality of life is said to be better in all these other nations. France comes out top for the third year in a row, ahead of Spain and Italy, while Poland is ranked seventh. Britons enjoy an average of 28 days holiday a year, which compares with 36 in France, 38 in Poland and Sweden, and 39 in Spain. Ania Lichota, moved from Poland to the UK since 2006: 'In England there are so many opportunities; for travel, for culture, music, cuisine, theatre. The financial services where I work, all have their hubs here. I don’t think I will ever be moving back to Poland’ Read more here . The average retirement age in the UK is put at 63, although it will rise in the coming years. This compares with 59 in Poland, and around 60 in France and Italy. Spending on health in the UK is put at 4.8 per cent of gross domestic product, which is below the average for the ten countries of 5.54 per cent. The figure is as high as 7.6 per cent in Sweden and 8.4 per cent in Denmark. Cynics will say the only  bright point is that average British life expectancy is  lower than in many other nations, which means our  misery will be curtailed. The average Briton lives for 80.4 years, versus 81.4 in France, 81.6 in Italy and 81.9  in Spain.

'It’s such a shame that people are focusing on whether the story is true,' Robert Allenby is believed to have said in text messages to the Golf Channel. 'I say you only have to look at me to see the truth.' 'Detectives have opened second degree robbery and fraudulent use of credit card investigations,' Ms Yu added. 'That means we investigate it as a felony rather than a misdemeanour. ''Second degree robbery is punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment; fraudulent use of credit cards is punishable by up to five years.' But other CCTV is being sought from the strip around the wine bar where Allenby was last seen. 'The (extra) video will be very helpful,' Honolulu Police Department Captain Rade Vanic said. Staff at the wine bar in which Allenby, 43, was last seen at about 11pm on Friday said 'we can't say anything about that', when contacted by Daily Mail Australia and asked if they had seen anything untoward on the night. With varying stories from Allenby and Charade Keane, the woman who helped the dazed and bruised Australian in the early hours on Saturday morning, detectives are trying to reconstruct the incident. They are believed to be already in possession of vision which shows Allenby leaving the Amuse Wine Bar at about 11pm on the Friday, with two, as yet unidentified men, and a woman. And more CCTV footage of two men buying alcohol, apparently with the golfer's credit card, has been taken from a store at Waikiki. Allenby said he couldn't remember much in the hours after being assaulted and robbed. Capt Vanic said not only were detectives attempting to find more surveillance footage of what Allenby described as a Hollywood-style attack and kidnapping, but they were now seeking video from stores where the culprits might have used his stolen credit cards. Police said they could publicly release video of suspects in the hope of identifying the thieves. 'We do have video from various retail establishments, so we are looking into it,' Capt Vanic said. 'Of course, if it does show individuals who are possible suspects, we will do our best to identify them and may even put it out with our Crime Stoppers information. 'But it is still very early on in our investigation.' Capt Vanic said Keane gave police a statement and they would interview her again if needed. Ms Keane 'dragged' Allenby to safety as he was arguing with two men in the park telling him 'you have to leave or they will kill you' The spot where Allenby was found 'dazed and confused'. 'Honolulu Police say 'we do have video from various retail establishments, so we are looking into it' The Amuse Wine Bar in Honolulu where Allenby was dining with friends before being bashed and robbed . The Amuse Wine Bar is inside the Honolulu Design Centre. It's where Allenby and friends were before the golfer was beaten and robbed . Robert Allenby missed the cut at the Sony Golf Open in Honolulu . Allenby was drinking with friends at the upmarket Amuse Wine Bar in Waikiki on Friday night and believed he was drugged, bashed in the face with a fist or baseball bat, tossed in the boot of a car, robbed and then dumped in a park 10 kilometres away. The drama began when Allenby was separated from his friends in the bar, caddie Mick Middlemo and Anthony Puntoriero. 'I didn't think I was going to survive this one,' Allenby said. 'I was separated from my friend in the bar after we had paid the tab at 10:48pm and he went to the bathroom and next thing you know I'm being dumped in a park miles away. 'I only know this part because a homeless woman found me and told me she saw a few guys pull up and throw me out of the car. 'That is where I got the scrapes above my eye, from the side-walk.' The homeless woman he referred to is believed to be Ms Keane, who said she found and helped Allenby a short distance away from the bar, perhaps 50 metres down the road, at about 1.30am - some two and a half hours after he disappeared. An image of the intersection where Charade Keane found Robert Allenby slumped in the gutter, bashed and trying to fend off two men . Australian golfer Robert Allenby was bloodied and bruised and without his wallet and phone before being placed in a taxi back to the Kahala Hotel by two good Samaritans, an ex-military officer and Charade Keane . The confusion over what happened to Robert Allenby includes his belief that he was found two and a half hours after he left his friends and some 10 kilometres away from where he was dining and Charade Keane's claim that it was just 50 metres from the Amuse Wine Bar . Bizarrely Allenby had an emotional reunion with the homeless woman, just hours after he accused her of being paid to spread false stories about what happened that night. The golfer embraced and kissed Ms Keane, as they greeted each other back at the spot where she said they first met, across the road from the Amuse Wine Bar in Waikiki on Saturday morning. 'I really appreciate what you did,' Allenby told her. The reunion came a few hours after the multi-millionaire pro-golfer reportedly speculated in text messages to Golf Central that Keane was was 'getting paid' to relay details of the incident to the media. Capt Vanic said robberies similar to the way Allenby described were not common in Honolulu, a popular destination for tourists from Australia and around the world. 'Honolulu is a big city and there are tourists who, unfortunately, are victims of a crime, but it is not something that happens very frequently in Honolulu,' Capt Vanic added. Allenby was in Hawaii to compete in the PGA Tour's Sony Open, but missed the halfway cut on Friday. Allenby, whose face was badly cut and bruised, announced on Tuesday he would not play in this week's PGA Humana Challenge event in La Quinta, California, on the advice of his doctor. 'This will enable me to ensure I am fully recovered prior to rejoining the PGA Tour,' he added .

"U.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo had domestic violence assault charges against her dismissed on Tuesday, ending what she called 'one of the most difficult and emotionally draining times of my life.' Now she can turn her attention fully to World Cup preparations. The case had been set for trial in a week in suburban Seattle. The U.S. Soccer Federation had resisted pressure from some to suspend Solo after she was charged with two misdemeanor counts of fourth-degree assault stemming from an altercation with her half-sister and 17-year-old nephew at a party in June. 'Today's decision brings closure to what has been one of the most difficult and emotionally draining times of my life,' Solo said in a statement, which she posted on Facebook and received 275 primarily supportive comments in the first 55 minutes. Charges dropped::  Hope Solo and husband Jerramy Stevens exit the court room at Kirkland Municipal Court on November 4, 2014 in Kirkland, Washington but charges were dropped in court on Tuesday . Her post: U.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo had domestic violence assault charges against her dismissed Tuesday, ending what she called 'one of the most difficult and emotionally draining times of my life' 'I always had faith that once the facts of the case were presented, I would be cleared of all charges and I am so happy and relieved to finally have it all behind me.' Solo, who also plays for the Seattle Reign, did not appear at Tuesday's hearing when Kirkland Municipal Court Judge Michael Lambo dismissed the charges. In her last appearance with the Americans, Solo started and had a save in a scoreless draw with host Brazil on December 21 in the championship of the 2014 International Tournament of Brasilia. The U.S. women's national team is in the tough Group D for the expanded 24-team Women's World Cup from June 6-July 5 in Canada. Solo's lawyer, Todd Maybrown, sought to have the charges dismissed on the grounds that the alleged victims refused to be interviewed about the case. 'We are gratified that, after considering all of the facts and circumstances of this case, the judge has dismissed all charged against Hope Stevens,' Maybrown said in a statement. 'From the beginning, I've stated that Hope was the victim of an assault in this case. With a careful review of the facts surrounding these matters, it is clear that Hope never should have faced charges in the first place. ' Charges dismissed:  U.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo has won two Olympic gold medals with the U.S. women's national team . 'Hope is very happy and relieved that she can now put this matter behind her. She looks forward to focusing her energies on the game she loves.' At a hearing last week, the judge renewed an order for a deposition after Solo's nephew and half-sister failed to appear for interviews. Prosecutors had said the pair didn't appear because they weren't served with subpoenas and there wasn't adequate time to notify them, given the New Year's Day holiday. In court documents, Solo said she was defending herself against her nephew, who is 6-foot-9 and weighs 280 pounds. She claims she was hit over the head with a broom handle. Solo's relatives claimed she attacked first. Messages left with prosecutors and a lawyer representing Solo's half-sister were not immediately returned Tuesday. The 33-year-old goalie has won two Olympic gold medals with the U.S. women's national team. Solo married former University of Washington and Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens in 2012. Stevens was arrested just before their wedding for investigation of assault after a disturbance involving Solo, but he was not charged. Maybrown also represented Stevens, who has a list of legal run-ins.","U.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo had domestic violence assault charges against her dismissed on Tuesday .

Vandon Gene, 26, taking a selfie - after asking Anderson Cooper to pose for a picture with him at the scene of a shooting . When Gene pressed Cooper for the selfie, the CNN anchor refused and added: 'Have a little respect for what happened here today.' When the reporter asked yet again, Cooper said: 'No, I will not take a photo with you on a day where someone was killed. It seems wildly inappropriate.' Instead of retreating in shame, Gene followed up by posting a video of his exchange with Cooper on YouTube, adding a series of self-pitying messages. The Canadian tweeted: 'Anderson Cooper exploits Ottawa shooting by flying to Ottawa, but has decency to criticize me for asking for a photo?' Gene also wrote: 'So @anderson cooper is an a**. Told me to give him ''a f****** break'' then went on a rant.' Cooper was quick to respond, tweeting back at Gene: 'Dude, you were rude and asking for a selfie near where a soldier was killed. It was completely inappropriate. Think about it. 'I can’t believe any station employs you, and if you want to be a journalist, learn how to behave when covering a story.' Venting: Gene posted a video of his angry exchange with Cooper, whom he called an 'a**,' on Twitter .

He later followed up saying that the reporter 'no longer has any association' with the news outlet, according to National Post. Gene then apologized himself, writing: 'I unreservedly apologize for my actions yesterday. It was completely inappropriate, disrepectful [sic], and distasteful.' The budding journalist, who describes himself as a 'news junkie,' appeared to have edited his tweets to remove the exchange with Cooper  Wednesday.

On his personal website, Gene describes himself as someone who 'believes in fair and balanced journalism.' '[He] searches for the facts, no matter where they may lie.

"Florida criminals could soon have their handcuffs secured by a hand with four NBA championship rings. Retired NBA star Shaquille O'Neal has applied to be a reserve police officer for Doral, about 13 miles from Miami.

"An Al Qaeda supporter from Brooklyn is suing the US, claiming that tight-fitting shackles have given him deep-vein thrombosis. Wesam El-Hanafi, 38, is due to be sentenced for helping terror network Al Qaeda. However, he is simultaneously suing the US, claiming that he's been mistreated since being detained and as a result has potentially life-threatening blood clots in one of his legs. El-Hanafi, an Egyptian-American, claims that his symptoms started after his arrest in Dubai in 2010. Trial: Wesam El-Hanafi, centre, during his initial appearance on terrorism-related charges at a US District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, in 2010 . Lawsuit: Wesam El-Hanafi claims that mistreatment after his arrest has left him with deep-vein thrombosis (stock image) He claims that his legs were shackled for three days and four nights and that his FBI handlers didn’t allow him to stretch his legs properly during the 14-hour flight back to America. His lawsuit claims that he was only allowed to walk around the plane once, for 15 minutes, so he could pray and use the bathroom. Despite his condition being diagnosed in 2011, he is alleging that it went untreated for nearly two years through a lack of compassion from prison authorities. The condition was exacerbated, he claims, when he was eventually given hospital treatment, but shackled so tightly that he was left in unbearable pain and needed another hospital stay two weeks later when he began coughing up blood. ‘He has trouble walking. He has constant pain,’ his lawyer Jake Harper told The New York Daily News. El-Hanafi, a computer engineer and former Lehman Brothers employee with a wife and three children, faces up to 20 years in jail. US authorities say that after meeting two Al Qaeda members in Yemen in 2008 he swore allegiance to their extremist organisation and taught them how to send undetected messages online.","Wesam El-Hanafi says he has been left him with a life-threatening condition .

"An outspoken Australian Islamist has been banned from appearing at a Sydney University event on the anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks. Uthman Badar - the spokesperson for the Australian-based Islamsit group Hizb ut-Tahrir - was due to speak at the University of Sydney on Thursday but in an 11th hour decision has been banned from appearing. Vice Chancellor Michael Spence cancelled the non-registered Q&A event declaring he was unaware that a Muslim student's association group had organised it. Uthman Badar, the media spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir, was to front an open Q&A event at Sydney University before it was cancelled . Mr Badar was advertised to appear at the Islamic Awareness Week, run by the Sydney University Muslim Students' Association, The Daily Telegraph reported. In a Facebook post he said he would be appearing as a member of an open 'QnA panel, along with Shaykh Wesam Charkawi, entitled 'Grill a Muslim' tomorrow.' The two-hour event was billed as an opportunity for people to 'ask anything and everything.' Thursday is the 13th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks . A spokeswoman for Sydney University said the it was not registered and security did not know about it. The ban comes on the same day Mr Badar made damming comments regarding Australia's hard-line stance on terrorism threats. He said that it if an attack 'does occur on Australian soil' the Government would be to blame because of its 'persisent unjust targeting of muslims.' The Australian reported that the Government is preparing to ramp up its terror security alert from medium to high for the first time, to ward off the threat of terror attacks. 'If an attack does occur on Australian soil...government policy of the last decade will be responsible for its persistent agression and imposition on the Muslim world and persistent unjust targeting of Muslims locally.' Mr Badar said the government can not 'persistently provoke and then expect to control the reaction.' Mr Badar's ban from Sydney University comes two months after he was dropped from the Festival of Dangerous Ideas event at the Sydney Opera House in August. Hizb ut-Tahrir Australia's spokesman Uthman Badar has been banned from speaking at Sydney University on the  anniversary of the September 11 attacks . The post as it appears on Uthman Badar's Facebook page advertising the event at Sydney University . Mr Badar was the subject of public backlash earlier this year when he was scheduled to give a talk entitled 'Honour Killings are Morally Justified' at Sydney's Festival of Dangerous Ideas. He and the festival made it clear they don't support honour killings. In a statement on its Facebook The Opera House said at the time: 'The Festival of Dangerous Ideas is intended to be a provocation to thought and discussion, rather than simply a provocation'. 'It is always a matter of balance and judgement, and in this case a line has been crossed... It is clear from the public reaction that the title has given the wrong impression of what Mr Badar intended to discuss. 'Neither Mr Badar, (festival organisers) the St James Ethics Centre, nor Sydney Opera House in any way advocates honour killings or condones any form of violence against women.' Mr Badar's defence came after it  revealed the Prime Minister's plan to stop extremists fighting in the Middle East from returning to Australia was in legal limbo. Mr Badar said the backlash against his slated Festival of Dangerous Ideas talk said more about bigotry in Australia than it did about him.","Uthman Badar has been banned from speaking at non-registered Muslim event at Sydney University .

A celebrity gossip site has claimed that one of their blind items predicted that L'Wren Scott was not well just four days before she killed herself in her Manhattan apartment. The site, Crazy Days and Nights, posted an item on Thursday March 13 about how a 'C list celebrity but is A list in her own little corner of the celebrity world' had disappeared and was going through a very rough patch with her cheating, shorter 'permanent A-lister ' boyfriend. Though the unsubstantiated claims were first posted as a blind item- and the name of the subject in question was left out of the post- the author later updated it after Scott's death was confirmed on Monday and claimed that she was the subject. Mick Jagger's spokesman immediately denied any claims that the longterm couple had separated before her death. Together: Mick Jagger's spokesperson confirmed that 'of course' they were still a couple when Scott killed herself but Jagger has been known to cheat on his partners in the past, as that was the reason for both divorces . Connections: A blind item described the subject as being 'a C list celebrity but is A list in her own little corner of the celebrity world' which would fit with Scott's reputation in the stylist and fashion communities, seen here at her 2008 show with Christy Turlington, Kyra Sedgwick and Ellen Barkin . Her roots: L'Wren was adopted by Mormon parents . in Roy, Utah and raised as LuAnn Bambrough, as seen here in pictures . from her high school yearbook . Though . Jagger's cheating has been cited as the cause for his two previous marriages, his representative . said that 'of course' the Rolling Stones frontman and the designer were . still together at the time of her death. No sources were revealed for the post nor is it clear how the anonymous blogger would have any inside knowledge to substantiate the claims. Resting place? It has been reported that Jagger is pushing for Scott to be buried at Hollywood Forever cemetery . One . of the most tangible connections in the blind item alludes to the fact that . Scott cancelled her London Fashion Week show a few months before her . death. At the time, she cited delayed fabric orders but her financial . filings have shown that the U.K. end of her luxury brand was in debt. 'There . are reports she had a breakdown because he was cheating on her. She . canceled a huge event she was working on and has retreated into a . hospital to get help although some people say she is hiding out at her . home with medical professionals,' the item reads. Sourcing: Crazy Days And Nights is run by an anonymous blogger who identifies themselves only as 'Entertainment Lawyer' and they are known for having a number of shocking items that are sometimes later proved correct . Mystery solved: The original blind item was posted on Thursday March 13, days before her suicide on Monday March 17 but after her death was confirmed, the blogger revealed that she was the subject of the post . No confirmations have been made regarding any medical treatment she may have received ahead of her March 17 death. Posts on Crazy Days and Nights are . attributed to an anonymous blogger who calls themselves 'Entertainment . lawyer' and there is no telling who their sources are. The New York Post's gossip columnist Cindy Adams also made outrageous and unsubstantiated claims that her friends were aware of her troubles and made no motions to help. 'Her stylist friends, fashion friends, p.r. friends, critic friends all say they knew she was hemorrhaging financially. Nobody helped,' Adams wrote today. The blind item was not the only sign of chatter about problems between Scott and Jagger to come out in recent days, however. The . Mail on Sunday has learned that the designer secretly remortgaged the . luxury Manhattan apartment for $1.2million (£700,000) then asked Jagger . to bail her out in February last year, triggering an argument. Over . the weekend, a source close to Jagger, who is worth a reported . £200 million, revealed he had been ‘blindsided’ by the extent of his . lover’s woes. Inseparable: Dating since 2001, the couple first . remained private and then began attending events together years later, . (seen left in 2006 and right in November of last year) The source emphatically denied claims by Scott’s friends that the couple’s relationship had been strained by a series of rows over money, saying:  ‘They were inseparable to the end. He did everything he could to help and support her. There was an element of frustration [for Mick] that money was being poured away into a bottomless pit. He wasn’t the only investor to feel that way.’ But Phillip Bloch, the stylist who befriended Scott, 49, when both started out as models in Paris, claimed: ‘Everyone knew the relationship was in trouble. Her spending could be reckless. There were massive rows.’ Another friend added: ‘There was a massive argument last year when Mick learned she had secretly borrowed against the apartment. Frozen out: Scott's sister Jan Shane (pictured) wants her to be buried in their family plot in Roy, Utah . ‘He bailed her out but she was going round saying he had told her, “Call me when you sort out your mess.”’ Jagger’s spokesman insisted he had never said this. There are also reportedly new tensions between Scott's family and Jagger, as the designer's estranged sister has called for her to be buried in the family plot in Roy, Utah. Scott, who was adopted by a Mormon family and raised by the name Luann Bambrough, was close with her brother Randall and hadn't spoken to her sister Jan Shane in six years. Randall, a financial adviser, had been working with her to sort out her business debt in recent months, has reportedly been in discussions with Jagger and agreed to his request to have the designer's body flown to Los Angeles for a funeral in California.  Jan told The Mail on Sunday that she has been left completely out of the negotiations and hopes that L'Wren's body will end up in the already-carved plot next to their parents. ‘No one has told me anything about a funeral. I’ve not had a single call from anyone in the Jagger camp. I’m beside myself,' she told The Mail On Sunday. ‘Are they going to make it so secret that her own family is banned from attending?’","Blind item posted four days before L'Wren Scott's funeral hints that a 'C list' star with a 'permanent A-lister' boyfriend was distraught .

Hotel: The four-star Hotel Football promises to provide football fans with 'the ultimate match day experience' Ex-footballers: The hotel opposite Old Trafford is brainchild of Gary Neville (left) and Ryan Giggs (right) The £250 price tag is for a standard room which has a king size bed or two single beds, 40"" Samsung smart TV with full Sky Sports package, as well as complimentary wifi and water. Prices are considerably less on non-match days. Speaking out on Twitter, @BleaseyMCred said: 'Bleeding hell @GNev2. Rooms from £150 pn and £4.90 per pint. I thought this hotel was for the fans.' To which Neville replied: 'Your looking at London prices mate. Pint 3.50 like Trafford arms and others!' In his tweet, Neville was explaining the fan was looking at beer prices for Football Cafe in London, which he also launched with Giggs. Another twitter user, @joeboff tweeted: 'So, everyone seems to agree that should have built a hotel for local people. Hmm.' Hotel Football promises to provide football fans with 'the ultimate match day experience', including corporate hospitality experiences, football-themed café, and the Old Trafford Supporters Club housed inside. There is also a rooftop pitch with views over Manchester. The hotel restaurant Café Football will serve traditional match day favourites like sausage rolls and burgers with a twist, as part of a menu designed by two Michelin star chef, Michael Wignall. Other Class of '92 alumni are involved in the project, including Philip Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt. Neville previously said: 'To make sure that the hotel appeals to everyone, not just football fans, we are working with some of the most talented people in the industry to create something unique and inviting – with a focus on excellent customer service.' The hotel is set to open in March.","It will cost £250 to stay at Hotel Football on a matchday in March 14 .

"L'Wren Scott's sister has lashed out at Sir Mick Jagger after the singer was photographed on the balcony of his hotel room in Zurich last weekend with a mystery brunette decades his junior. The Rolling Stones front man was seen spending time with the woman just 11 weeks since the fashion designer committed suicide. Jan Shane, 53, said: 'And people wonder why L'Wren was so depressed?' Moving on: Sir Mick Jagger is seen being embraced by a mystery brunette on the balcony of his hotel in Zurich . While the rock star is said to have been left ‘devastated and distraught’ after his 49-year-old lover of 13 years was found hanged in her New York apartment on March 17, Shane says Mick 'will never change' his ways. 'These pictures make me really wonder what Mick is thinking and feeling. His daughter says that he is still heartbroken and so devastated about losing my sister,' she told The Mirror. 'And then you see these photos he will never change.' Close: The young woman was seen leaning over the rock star as they took in the view . Jagger was seen spending time with the woman just 11 weeks after L'Wren Scott committed suicide . Solace:  According to reports, Sir Mick spent two days with the woman after meeting her in a Zurich nightclub . Quick change: The woman stayed in the same outfit while the rocker was seen wearing two outfits . Meanwhile, friends say the rock star has been ‘drowning his sorrows’ with women since the suicide of his Scott. A friend said over the weekend: ‘Some men drown their sorrow in drink. Mick doesn’t drink much but he drowns his sorrows in women.’ They said that the mystery brunette in Zurich was not the first woman Mick has spent time with since the death of his girlfriend. Together: The singer pictured with his lover of 13 years designer L'Wren Scott. Scott tragically passed away on March 17 . Alone: The Rolling Stones singer appears on the balcony on his own shirtless and with a towel wrapped around his waist . Another added: ‘He has reverted back to his old ways. This is how he deals with things, even in his 70s. Lashing out: L'Wren's sister Jan Shane is pictured at her Utah home on March 19 . ‘Through good times and bad, the thing that never changes is Mick’s love for women. Sex is like a coping mechanism for him.’ And a close friend admitted: ‘He grieved hard but Mick is someone who has always loved life and loves women. This is just Mick being Mick and moving on the only way he knows how.’ According to reports, Sir Mick spent two days with the woman after meeting her in a Zurich nightclub following a Rolling Stones gig. As well as being pictured shirtless on the balcony of his hotel penthouse, he was also seen being embraced by the woman, who appeared to be wearing one of his shirts. A source said Sir Mick had deliberately posed on the balcony ‘to show he’s back in business’. ‘He doesn’t do anything by accident,’ the source added. ‘He will have known photographers were watching. It was just nice to see Mick smiling again.’ Last night, L’Wren’s sister Jan Shane – who was estranged from the fashion designer at the time of her death – said: ‘These pictures make me wonder what Mick is really thinking and feeling. ‘His daughter says that he is heartbroken and devastated about losing my sister, and then you see these photos. He’ll never change.’ L’Wren is said to have killed herself after falling heavily into debt. In a statement in March, Sir Mick said  he ‘failed to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way’.","Rolling Stones singer seen with brunette on balcony in Zurich, Switzerland .

"Andy Murray is prepared to forgive and forget when he faces the man who criticised his groundbreaking appointment of a female coach last summer. The British No 1’s second-round opponent at the Australian Open will be local hope Marinko Matosevic, who expressed some fairly unreconstructed macho views when Murray teamed up with Amelie Mauresmo after the French Open. Asked what he thought of the idea, the Australian known as ‘Mad Dog’ declared publicly what some of his peers or former players were only prepared to say in private. Andy Murray beat Indian qualifier Yuki Bhambri in the Australian Open first round on Monday . Murray beat Bhambri 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 in a laboured straight-sets victory . ‘I couldn’t do it because I don’t think that highly of the women’s game,’ he commented. ‘It’s all equal rights these days, politically correct. Someone’s got to give it a go, but it won’t be me.’ Now Murray has set up their first encounter since Matosevic brought the furies on himself. It is his reward for a sometimes laboured 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 victory over Indian qualifier Yuki Bhambri. The world No 6 does not bear a grudge after Matosevic, with whom he has always got on well, swiftly moved to make amends last year. ‘He came and spoke to me immediately about it when it was in the papers and apologised, and spoke to my mum about it and apologised, and apologised to Amelie,’ revealed Murray. The British No 1 takes on local hope Marinko Matosevic in the second round . Matosevic said he didn't think highly enough of the women's game to hire a female coach after Murray appointed Amelie Mauresmo last year . ‘He’s the sort of guy, he can say something and he doesn’t necessarily mean anything bad with it if that’s his opinion. If he doesn’t want to work with a female coach then that’s absolutely fine and that’s the case with many players. I’m not offended by it and I get on absolutely fine with him.’ The extrovert Matosevic, 29, let out an animalistic scream when he finally edged out Russian Alexander Kudryavtsev in a deciding fifth set, but insists he is mellowing and trying to avoid controversy. ‘I guess I’m definitely maturing in my old age, I’m a late bloomer,’ he said. ‘I guess mentally-wise I’m a late developer in that department as well.’ He described Murray’s skill levels as ‘probably second only to Roger (Federer)’ and that is why the Scot’s subtle ability to break down an opponent will probably prove too much for him when they meet. Mauresmo watch on as Murray safely progresses through the first round . Matosevic collapses to the floor in celebration after beating Alexander Kudryavtsev in his first round . One of the many fascinating questions to be answered this year is whether the Australian’s original take on the Mauresmo arrangement proves to be correct or if she can coax Murray back to the heights achieved with Ivan Lendl. They have had a chance to work together in Miami and, judging by yesterday, have altered his service action with particular reference to the ball toss which was a nagging issue through 2014. What does not appear to have changed is Murray’s tendency to show frustration and communicate angrily with himself when things are not working out, as they sometimes failed to do against Bhambri. Murray admitted this is a natural tendency, saying: ‘When things don’t go people’s way, it’s normal. If I went to play five-a-side football with my dad’s friends and someone misplaces a pass, everyone’s reaction when they do something wrong is to want to say something. World No 6 Murray shakes hand with his opponent after the victory on Monday . Murray signs autographs for fans in Melbourne after the straight-set win . ‘It’s about making sure you aren't letting those things affect you... it’s not something that necessarily comes naturally to everyone.’ Murray feels his back is now in such good shape and he looks to be moving as well as ever. It is difficult to see Matosevic piercing his defences. They actually met the week before last at the Hopman Cup in Perth, with no ranking points at stake, and Murray won easily. But, as his demeanour against Bhambri sometimes showed — he needed to recover from 1-4 in the third set — the pressures are very different in a Grand Slam.","Andy Murray faces Marinko Matosevic in  second round of Australian Open .

"Andy Murray hit the practice court at Melbourne Park on Tuesday as he prepared for his second-round match at the Australian Open. Murray hit with Frenchman Richard Gasquet for around 90 minutes on the outside courts ahead of Wednesday's last-64 clash with Aussie Marinko Matosevic. The British No 1 made a fine start to his campaign Down Under on Monday, beating Indian qualifier Yuki Bhambri in straight sets. Andy Murray hits with Richard Gasquet under the watchful eye of Amelie Mauresmo . Around 250 fans turned up on Court 17 to watch Murray practice with Gasquet . Murray looked in good form as he came through his opening match in straight sets against Yuki Bhambri . Murray looked relaxed and had some fun with the crowd as he prepared for his second-round match . Murray trained on Court 17 under the watchful eyes of coach Amelie Mauresmo, trainer Matt Little and physio Mark Bender, as well as a crowd of around 250 spectators. The Scot even received some advice from a compatriot amongst the crowd after he missed a volley which had clipped the net cord. The spectator shouted in a loud Scottish accent, 'Come on Andy, keep your eye on the ball', to which Murray light-heartedly replied, 'When it hits the net, it's quite hard.'

Murray took time to chat with Gasquet's coach Sebastien Grosjean, the former world No 4 who he played at London's Queen's Club in 2008, albeit for only two games before the Frenchman retired due to injury. He also received regular updates from Little on the first-round match between James Ward, who was his training partner during the off-season in Miami, and Fernando Verdasco which was taking place at the same time at the opposite end of the tournament site. Verdasco won in four sets. Murray and world No 81 Matosevic meet on Wednesday for the second time this year, with the former having won their encounter at the recent Hopman Cup event in Perth in straight sets.","Andy Murray beat Yuki Bhambri in straight sets on Monday .

"Bayer Leverkusen are considering a bid for Tottenham striker Roberto Soldado. Hamburg are interested in Leverkusen's unsettled Swiss striker Josip Drmic and Leverkusen want a replacement.

"James Ward was left rueing a series of missed chances as he went out of the Australian Open after giving the seeded Spaniard Fernando Verdasco a first round scare. The British No 2 outplayed Verdasco for spells  but could never quite drive home the advantage in going down 2-6, 6-0, 7-6, 6-3 in a shade under two and three quarter hours. With Heather Watson and Kyle Edmund also falling, it meant that Andy Murray was left in isolation as the sole GB singles representative by the middle of the second afternoon at Melbourne Park. James Ward gave Fernando Verdasco a scare but ultimately could not get the win he craved . Ward took the opening set against Verdasco but lost the next three . Verdasco celebrates his win over the British No 2 in the opening round of the Australian Open . Ward did enough to show the improvements he has been adding to his game, but at this rarefied level – the first time he has been in a Grand Slam main draw by right – there was a reminder that you have to take your opportunities when they come. Covering the court well and often giving as good as he got in the rallies, the 27 year-old Londoner pounced on a slow start from the former top ten player and then had a break point in the opening game of the second set. He recovered from the ensuing landslide to lead 4-2 in the third set, moving the powerful lefthander around to stop him teeing off with his renowned forehand too much. Ward reflects on a number of missed opportunities as he went out of the Australian Open in the first round . Verdasco and Ward shake hands at the end of their four set match . But Ward, who knows Verdasco well from his days training in Spain, got pegged back from leading at 3-0 in the tiebreak. He forced a set point at 6-5 in the breaker but could only play a viciously kicking first serve long, then had an ace pumped past him before missing a backhand to concede the set. While he is undoubtedly on the up, it is the playing of the biggest points that so often separates the accomplished rank-and-file from the likes of Verdasco, who has been a semi-finalist here. In the fourth set the Spaniard got ahead immediately with a break and never let up from there. Defeat against a player ranked seventy places above him leaves Ward still only on the cusp of the world's top 100, a mark he hopes to breach in the next month. Both players produced some high quality tennis, and it was to Ward's credit that he was so competitive, especially as he revealed afterwards that he has been coping with a family bereavement. 'It was a pretty good level and he said that to me afterwards. He produced at the big moments, but he's going away thinking that if he plays me again this year it won't be easy for him. I'm working hard and I'm stronger and fast than I've ever been. 'My grandmother passed away five days ago, I saw her over Christmas and it's been tough as we are a close family. I am going home for the funeral next week, at the moment that is the priority. I don't know what I will do the next couple of weeks but then I plan to play in Rotterdam and Dubai before the Davis Cup.' Ward looks sure to be the second singles player behind Andy Murray for the World Group first round tie against the USA in Glasgow in early March. Murray returns to the Margaret Court Arena for his second round match against Marinko Matosevic that will take place in the early hours of the morning UK time.","Fernando Verdasco beats James Ward 2-6, 6-0, 7-6, 6-3 .

"Premier League clubs could have signed Alexis Sanchez for as little as £2million had they shown enough belief in him, the man who brought him to Europe has claimed. Udinese president Giampaolo Pozzo, who bought Sanchez from Corbreloa for that price back in 2006, said bigger clubs were aware of the attacking prodigy but he chose to move to Italy because they were the first to show faith in his ability. 'The big clubs, not just English, had sensed the deal but we were good at getting the player first when he was not yet known,' Pozzo told The Sun. 'He wanted to sign for us because firstly, he wanted to come to Europe and then because we were the first to believe in him. Alexis Sanchez playing for Serie A side Udinese during their clash with Lecce back in 2011 . Sanchez was sent out on loan for two seasons by Udinese before returning to their first team . 'Our scouts in South America saw his unquestionable technical qualities. But, from when we started following him, he also had a personality that was out of the ordinary for a boy of that age.' Udinese loaned Sanchez to Colo-Colo and Argentine giants River Plate before finally bringing him back to play in their first team. He flourished in Italy, making his name in three remarkable seasons at the club. One man with first hand experience of playing with Sanchez is Watford striker Matej Vydra, who was at Udinese at the same time. Sanchez scores for Barcelona against Real Madrid in 'El Classico' at the Nou Camp in 2012 . Sanchez competes for an aerial duel with Manchester City defender Gael Clichy last season . He said: 'He will help Arsenal's players. When at Udinese, every day he tried to make his team-mates better and it's good when someone helps you. He was young but was like a coach and wanted to help.' Sanchez's form ultimately saw him picked up by then-European Champions Barcelona, who paid £30m for his services in 2011. And after three seasons with the Catalan club, in which he scored 39 goals in 88 league appearances, Arsenal paid £30m to bring him to the Premier League.

"Household name: Critics say Alan Titchmarsh has been given preferential treatment because of his popularity . His fellow gardeners were all banned from presenting at Chelsea Flower Show when they found themselves at risk of ‘conflict of interest’. But it appears when you are Alan Titchmarsh and regarded as the nation’s favourite green-fingered expert, the same guidelines don’t apply. The BBC was yesterday accused of having one rule for Titchmarsh and another for its lesser lights after it emerged the gardener has been allowed to present Chelsea Flower Show coverage while being the face of Waitrose, a sponsor at the event. The supermarket’s exhibit of UK produce — featuring fruit, vegetables, flowers and plants on sale in its stores — this week won a gold medal at Chelsea. Titchmarsh, 64, has a lucrative deal to promote the chain’s gardening range. Until recently, the 'nation’s favourite gardener' also had a multi-million-pound contract as an ambassador for B&Q, sponsor of Prince Harry’s garden at the Chelsea show. Last year the BBC banned three presenters — Joe Swift, Chris Beardshaw and Andy Sturgeon — who had designed Chelsea gardens from covering the event because of 'conflict of interest' concerns. But Titchmarsh, who appears prominently on Waitrose’s website hailing the show as 'magical', has not been dropped by the BBC this year. The presenter, who remains a 'friend of B&Q', according to the garden centre chain, was free to highlight Harry’s silver medal- winning garden on BBC2 this week. Critics claimed that the corporation has one rule for its best-known presenters and another for lesser lights. The gardening writer and broadcaster Steve Bradley said: 'It just seems to me the bigger you are the more you get away with. 'If these people are going to work for Waitrose or B&Q, the BBC shouldn’t have them doing Chelsea Flower Show and should give  a chance to other guys who don’t get a look in. 'The bigger you become, the more they’ll bend the rules for you. Titchmarsh still does a good job but the rules are the rules and should apply to everybody.’ Axed: Joe Swift (left) and Andy Sturgeon (right) are counted among the lesser-known presenters who were taken off the programme last year because of their commercial interests in the competition . Following the rules: Diarmuid Gavin (left) was taken off BBC coverage in 2006 and Chris Beardshaw (right) could not commentate on last year's event while his design was in the running for a prize . Last year Titchmarsh’s usual Chelsea . co-presenter Joe Swift was dropped from the main evening programme after . he designed a show garden for DIY chain Homebase. And Beardshaw and Sturgeon were not allowed on screen until the winners of their category had been announced. Diarmuid Gavin was dropped by the BBC from its 2006 Chelsea coverage after appearing in a commercial for compost company Westland. And in 1976, Percy Thrower was axed by the BBC from his job presenting Gardener’s World for appearing in an ICI weedkiller advert. TaxPayers’ Alliance research director . John O’Connell said: 'It’s important the BBC does not let  presenters . promote their commercial interests on a channel which is funded by . licence fee payers. 'It’s . also critical that if it has one rule for a presenter such as Alan . Titchmarsh it should have the same rules for everyone else.' Green fingered: Daily Mail journalist Chris Beardshaw could not work for BBC while his Wormcast Garden design (pictured) was in the Chelsea Flower Show in 2012 . By the book: Andy Sturgeon followed the guidelines last year and bowed out of presenting while his Cancer Research UK garden (pictured) was on show. The same rules have not been applied to Mr Titchmarsh's commercial interest . The BBC said: 'Alan has ensured that his relationship with Waitrose does not breach our guidelines and will not impact on show coverage. 'He will not be associated with the Waitrose exhibit, as is the case with other BBC presenters who have commercial relationships with Chelsea exhibitors. 'Alan can mention B&Q if it is editorially relevant. As he no longer has a contract with B&Q, there is no conflict of interest.' Titchmarsh’s agent Annie Sweetbaum said: 'The only stand that Alan cannot mention is the one being sponsored by Waitrose.'","Presenter Alan Titchmarsh, 64 accused of having a 'conflict of interest' as the ambassador for Waitrose .

"Alan Titchmarsh has been dropped as the face of the BBC's coverage of The Chelsea Flower Show. The announcement comes six months after criticism of his hosting while also being being a face of Waitrose, one of the show's sponsors . For 30 years, he has helped educate green-fingered enthusiasts on everything from their Orchids to their Azaleas. But the BBC yesterday announced that Alan Titchmarsh will no longer present their coverage of the Chelsea Flower Show – just six months after the star became embroiled in a sponsorship row. The 64-year-old is being replaced by Gardeners’ World host Monty Don and newsreader Sophie Raworth - who unlike the majority of Chelsea presenters is not a gardening expert - as part of a revamp of the corporation’s coverage. Titchmarsh has presented the long-running event, which has become a horticultural highlight with viewers, since 1983. However, the BBC came under fire in May this year after it emerged he had been allowed to front the coverage on BBC1 and BBC2 while also being the face of Waitrose, a sponsor at the event. The supermarket’s exhibit of UK produce — featuring fruit, vegetables, flowers and plants on sale in its stores — won a gold medal at the event this year.

Gardeners' World host Monty Don, left, and newsreader Sophie Raworth, right, will front the corporation's coverage of the popular flower show in 2014 . The Chelsea Flower Show had been Titchmarsh’s last major commitment for the BBC, and his departure effectively ends a lengthy association. A BBC spokeswoman said: ‘The way the Chelsea coverage will be presented across the BBC has changed for 2014, and Alan decided to step away from next year’s show.’ Titchmarsh said: ‘I really enjoyed my 30 years of presenting Chelsea Flower Show coverage for the BBC and wish the new team every success.’ The presenter, who began his broadcasting career as a horticulture expert on Nationwide, left his role as anchor of BBC2’s Gardeners’ World in 2002, which had been filmed in his own garden. Between 1997 and 2002 he hosed BBC programme Ground Force, which at its peak pulled in 12 million viewers. But he has increasingly turned his attentions away from the BBC and now has an afternoon ITV chat show and hosts a series on Classic FM. Miss Raworth said: ‘I am delighted and honoured to be a part of the Chelsea 2014 team. I grew up in a family of very keen gardeners so know something about the joys and sheer hard work that go in to creating such beautiful places.’ Titchmarsh has proved hugely popular with viewers and in in 2007 he was named as one of the 100 greatest sex symbols in a TV poll. His Madame Tussauds waxwork was once revealed to be ‘one of the most fondled’, and apparently gets kissed so often that lipstick has to be washed from the face of the waxwork twice a week.","The BBC announced Gardeners' World presenter Monty Don and newsreader Sophie Raworth will replace Alan Titchmarsh after 30 years .

"English Football is 'making headway' in its attempts to improve opportunities for black coaches, the Football Association believes. Heather Rabbatts, the FA's diversity chief, made the observation after chairing a meeting between football authorities and campaign groups aimed at addressing the low numbers of black and minority ethnic (BAME) individuals in coaching or administrative positions. The summit, held on Tuesday, was attended by representatives of the Premier League, Football League, Professional Footballers' Association, Kick it Out and Show Racism the Red Card. Heather Rabbatts claims English football is 'making headway' in providing opportunities for black coaches . Also present was Sports Minister Helen Grant and former England defender Sol Campbell who, along with the PFA, has called for the introduction of a version of American football's 'Rooney Rule'. The Rooney Rule, which compels clubs to include at least one candidate from BAME backgrounds on their shortlists for positions, was one of the issues discussed at the meeting. Rabbatts believes progress is being made following the launch of the FA's Inclusion and Anti-Discrimination Action Plan in 2012. Rabbatts, an FA board member, said: 'There is now a clear programme of change which all the football authorities are working to. At its heart it is about ending the 'closed system' which has characterised football for so long. Former defender Sol Campbell has called for the introduction of a version of American football's 'Rooney Rule' Sports Minister Helen Grant (right) also attended the meeting addressing the low numbers of black and minority ethnic (BAME) individuals in coaching or administrative positions in football . 'The 'On Board' governance training programme supported by the FA and the PFA is now placing senior ex-BAME players on to boards to develop their experience to promote representation at the highest level of governance. 'We're making headway on the coaching front too. On developing BAME coaches and managers both the FA and Premier League have schemes in place which will provide places for black coaches to gain elite experience and the Football League is developing its own proposals which it will take to its meeting in June.' Grant also felt the meeting was a constructive one and hopes progress will continue. She said: 'I was pleased with the level of commitment shown at the meeting and will be receiving regular updates from football on this important issue, with a follow-up meeting planned for the summer.'","Heather Rabbatts chaired a meeting on Tuesday between football authorities and campaign groups to discuss improving chances .

'The girl who wouldn't die', Carina says she is convinced she will . recover and that hopes to move in to her own flat in the future. ‘And I will be working as a graphic designer and be able to ride Mathilde properly,’ she said. No hope: After speaking to her parents it was decided that the apparatus which kept her breathing was to be turned off and organ donation was prepared . Awake: The family had already said goodbye when the hospital called and said Carina had opened her eyes .

The girl was never declared brain-dead, that was never the case. 'In fact, the doctors saved her life . with the treatment they gave her.

"Leighton Baines gave Kevin Mirallas a couple of hefty slaps to the head as he refused to hand over the ball – appearing less like encouragement for the impending penalty kick and more like, 'What the hell are you doing?' That was exactly what Everton manager Roberto Martinez was thinking on the touchline as his winger, who had never taken a Premier League spot-kick, refused to hand the ball over to Baines who has scored 15 of the 16 he's struck. Afterwards, Martinez claimed he hooked Mirallas at half-time of the goalless draw with West Bromwich Albion due to a hamstring injury on Monday evening. It wasn't the first and certainly won't be the last of the penalty rows and here, Sportsmail takes a look back at some of the others. Kevin Mirallas missed a penalty as Everton and West Brom played out a goalless draw on Monday night . The Belgian stepped up to take the spot-kick despite regular taker Leighton Baines also being on the field .

Baines appeared to back away and let Mirallas take the penalty as he patted the Belgian forward on the head . Mirallas (centre) runs towards the penalty area as his Everton team-mates try to reason with him . THOSE WHO MISSED... Pajtim Kasami . Fulham v Chelsea, September 2011 . Martin Jol ended up fining himself after a row over penalties. On the pitch, 19-year-old Pajtim Kasami had angered the then-Fulham manager by refusing to let designated penalty taker Orlando Sa take a spot-kick in normal time of their Carling Cup tie with Chelsea. Kasami was fined £500 by Jol after the game went to extra-time and they lost on penalties. But the Dutchman later fined himself. While Jol had told Sa he was on spot-kick duty, he had failed to inform the rest of the team and his actions angered senior players. Pajtim Kasami fails with this penalty attempt for Fulham against Chelsea in the League Cup back in 2011 . Kasami (left) failed and infuriated his Fulham manager Martin Jol (right) at Stamford Bridge . Daniel Sturridge . Liverpool v Everton, January 2014 . Less of a row between the takers, this one. Steven Gerrard had handed over his penalty-taking duties to Daniel Sturridge who had already scored two sublime strikes past bitter Merseyside rivals Everton. Unfortunately for the England striker he blazed his effort over the bar. He was then substituted by boss Brendan Rodgers where a row ensued on the touchline. Sturridge was forced to say sorry, afterwards. 'I want to apologise for my reaction,' he said. 'It was just disappointment after missing the penalty, but I let myself down and the fans. I apologise if it caused anyone any offence.' Gerrrard added: 'I told him to take the penalty, so I have to hold my hands up and take the blame for that.'

Sturridge was taken off in January 2014 after missing a penalty despite Steven Gerrard being on the pitch . Liverpool striker Sturridge confronts Brendan Rodgers after missing a penalty in January last year . Alexis Sanchez . Arsenal v QPR, December 2014 . Arsenal's golden boy turned a slight shade of red on Boxing Day. Santi Cazorla had already scored two penalties against Stoke and Newcastle in December, but while the nation were tucking into their Christmas dinner leftovers Sanchez insisted on taking one when he went down in the box against QPR. Cazorla made way, but Sanchez struck a weak penalty which was easily saved by Rob Green. He did, however, make up for it by scoring the first and setting up the second in a 2-1 win. Arsenal talisman Alexis Sanchez took penalty duties off Santi Cazorla (right) on Boxing Day but missed . Sanchez's tame penalty was saved by Rob Green but Arsenal still won 2-1 against Queens Park Rangers . Dani Osvaldo . Sampdoria v Roma, February 2013 . Never far from controversy, Dani Osvaldo overruled legendary penalty taker Francesco Totti while he was at Roma. Osvaldo then proceeded to hit a tame effort into the arms of the Sampdoria goalkeeper and Roma lost 3-1. Osvaldo apologised on Twitter afterwards. Six months later he was sold on to Southampton, where it was made very clear that Rickie Lambert – who scored all 34 of the penalties he took for the south coast club – would be taking them. Marcello Trotta . Brentford v Doncaster, April 2013 . Marcello Trotta had only come on in the 77th minute when, on loan at Brentford from Fulham, he demanded to take a stoppage-time penalty against Doncaster in a battle at the top of League One. Had they scored, Brentford could've gone on to win promotion. With that glory in mind Trotta wrestled the ball from regular taker Kevin O'Connor, but hit the crossbar with his effort. Doncaster then broke up the other end and scored to win promotion. Remarkably, Brentford took him on loan for another season the following campaign. 'I can't change what happened in the past,' Trotta said afterwards. Marcello Trotta missed this late penalty to deny Brentford automatic promotion in a dramatic finale in 2013 . Trotta of Brentford (centre) hold his head in his hands after missing a last-minute penalty . Paul Kitson . West Ham v Everton, April 1997 . An incident where an act of generosity left two strikers red-faced and a manager fuming. West Ham were 2-0 ahead against Everton through Paul Kitson's double. They won a penalty to secure the victory and in the absence of the injured Julian Dicks, spot-kick duties fell to John Hartson. But he selflessly handed the ball to Kitson to complete his hat-trick, only for Neville Southall to save and Everton to come back to draw 2-2, leaving West Ham manager Harry Redknapp furious. THOSE WHO SCORED... Xabi Alonso . Real Madrid v Villarreal, February 2010 . Xabi Alonso was yet to score for Real Madrid following his £30million switch from Liverpool, but spotted the perfect opportunity with the team 5-2 ahead against Villarreal and a penalty won with three minutes to play. Cristiano Ronaldo, already with a goal in the game, had other ideas, picked the ball up and strode to the spot. Alonso begged and pleaded with Real's star man to let him take it and Ronaldo eventually relinquished the ball. Real fans were calling for Raul to take it but Alonso stepped up to slot the ball in. Most of the players laughed and celebrated with Alonso. Ronaldo wouldn't look at him. Former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso negotiated with Cristiano Ronaldo over taking a penalty . Alonso tried to appease a sulking Cristiano Ronaldo after scoring a penalty against Villarreal in 2010 . Despite his initial reaction, Ronaldo eventually congratulated Alonso's first strike for Los Blancos . Paolo Di Canio . West Ham v Bradford, February 2000 . West Ham were losing 4-2 to Bradford, then in the top flight, when an almighty argument broke out between Paolo Di Canio and Frank Lampard when a spot-kick was awarded. Lampard, the penalty taker, placed the ball and was ready to take it. Di Canio then repositioned it himself and scored the spot-kick. The pair continued arguing back to the halfway line. Joe Cole then equalised and, in his frustration, Lampard netted a late winner. Former West Ham stars Frank Lampard and Paolo Di Canio were involved in an almighty argument in 2000 . THE PENALTY TAKERS WHO STOOD FIRM... Frank Lampard . Chelsea Wigan, May 2010 . Chelsea were a goal ahead against Wigan knowing a win would secure them the Premier League title on the last day of the season when they won a first-half penalty. With the game still in the balance, Frank Lampard stuck to his principles and stood firm as top-scorer Didier Drogba tried to steal the ball off him to make sure he finished the campaign with the Golden Boot. Lampard swept in the spot kick and Chelsea proceeded to hit eight past their opponents. Drogba ended up netting a 17-minute hat-trick including a penalty, this time Lampard standing aside with the team already having five, as they sealed the title. Lampard also clashed with Didier Drogba over a penalty as Chelsea secured the 2010 Premier League title . Former Blue Lampard scored the eventual spot-kick, with Drogba scoring a hat-trick in the 8-0 win . Jonathan De Guzman . Swansea v Bradford, February 2013 . Nathan Dyer became possibly the only person to win a cup final at Wembley, trouncing the opposition 5-0, and still sulk at the final whistle. The Swansea attacking midfielder was on a hat-trick with his side already three goals in front when they won a penalty in the 59th minute. A blazing row ensued between Dyer and penalty taker Jonathan De Guzman who refused to give his team-mate all the glory. De Guzman scored and Swansea won the League Cup emphatically, securing their first major trophy in 101 years. Dyer was noticeably subdued in the celebrations.

"Hearts owner Ann Budge is demanding answers on the safety of her club’s supporters following Friday’s abandoned Championship match at Rangers. Followers of the Tynecastle club are claiming on social media and online message boards that they were targeted after the game at Ibrox was called off due to snow on the pitch after just 25 minutes. Videos have been posted online showing angry scenes with both sets of fans being segregated by stewards, while some Hearts fans claim missiles were thrown at buses departing the area of the stadium.

Striker Kenny Miller (right) tries to avoid a tackle from Alim Ozturk early on in the top-of-the-table clash . Owner Ann Budge (left) has demanded answers after Hearts fans claimed they were targeted at Ibrox . Police Scotland have confirmed an investigation is underway following ‘several acts of disorder at Ibrox’ with Rangers fans also protesting against their club’ s board. A concerned Budge said she needs more answers before she decides what action she will take. ‘Whether it is Hearts fans or any other fans, if you see that sort of thing happening then you need to be asking questions,’ said the Tynecastle chairwoman. ‘We’ve had lots of things being checked and double checked. ‘Clearly there are some questions that we need to ask. ‘We have to find out the facts as best we can and take it from there.’ Referee Bobby Madden gestures for the players to return to the dressing rooms after abandoning the match . Rangers fans gesture towards Hearts' travelling supporters as an electronic board explains the abandonment . Budge also confessed she was taken aback that referee Bobby Madden allowed the game to go ahead after the Govan area was hit by snow and freezing temperatures. She told STV: ‘I was looking outside and wondering if we were seriously going to be playing a game. But I’m not the expert and the experts made the decision so I wouldn’t question that.’ Meanwhile, Budge supports plans to introduce regionalised group sections to the League Cup by 2016. Under proposals discussed at a meeting of all 42 of the country’s senior clubs at Hampden yesterday, the competition would start earlier, at the beginning of July. A group stage would guarantee clubs at least two games in the tournament but there was caution expressed by lower league clubs yesterday, who had concerns over a longer season. Police and stewards are forced to hold people back as Hearts and Rangers fans attempt to confront each other inside Ibrox . Rival fans clash after referee Madden decided the match could not continue beyond the 25-minute mark . ‘Well, it seems to me like a very good idea,’ said the Hearts owner. ‘But that said, a number of the other clubs are part-time. ‘There are some real issues for them if we do that but I think it’s a step in the right direction.’ Kilmarnock chairman Michael Johnston: ‘I think it’s unlikely there will be any changes for next season. ‘It’s probably going to be summer of 2016 before they are implemented. But yes, regional groups are on the agenda. ‘I think there was a desire to have summer football and part of the plan is to have the League Cup start in early July and regionalised so that fans don’t have to travel so far on warm summer evenings and weekends. ‘They will be able to come out and enjoy competitive football at an earlier stage than normal.’","Rangers' clash with Hearts was abandoned after 25 minutes due to snow .

"Charles Green launched an outspoken defence of Mike Ashley and the current Rangers regime. In a staggering interview granted to Sky Sports from a hospital bed, the former Rangers Chief Executive shot down internet rumours he had been arrested over his role in the Ibrox club's demise. A much-derided figure following the doomed takeover which left Rangers back at the financial precipice, however, Green claimed Mike Ashley is the right man to turn the club around. And took a verbal swipe at would-be owner and fans favourite Dave King, insisting current director Sandy Easdale is more deserving of supporter adulation. Charles Green spoke in an interview with Sky Sports whilst he was laid up in hospital for a knee operation . The former Rangers chief executive (right) came to the defense of the existing regime at Ibrox . Green came to the defence of Newcastle chairman Mike Ashley (left) after saying that he did not like him . Pausing for dramatic effect throughout Green, in hospital for a knee operation, said: 'Days like today make me think I should go back (to Rangers). 'The current team are doing a great job. Maybe the fans don't like them and don't like Mike Ashley. 'I don't like Mike Ashley, but I do believe he is the right man for the job. 'I actually think his team are the right people. 'Derek Llambias (Chief Executive) might have had a charisma bypass, but actually he is a good guy doing a good job. He did it at Newcastle. Green said that current chief exec Derek Llambias (right) was a good guy despite having a 'charisma bypass' Green then hit out at would-be owner Dave King by mentioning he has numerous convictions against his name . 'I met him when I took Llambias into Ibrox when we did the deal for the naming rights (sold to Sports Direct for a pound). 'The reality is that these people have done nothing but good. 'They have put money in. 'Sandy Easdale is exactly the same. 'All Sandy Easdale has done is put his hand in his pocket, pull money out and put it into Rangers. 'He hasn't taken any money out and yet the fans are slaughtering him. 'Yet here we have Dave King. Sandy has one charge and one conviction against him – Dave King has 40 to settle with the South African authorities. 'You have Sandy Easdale, who has put money in – Dave King who hasn't.' Expressing regret over the disharmony and split between board and supporters Green – who left Rangers with a near £1million pay-off in 2013 – urged fans to give Ashley time. Rangers football board chairman Sandy Easdale (left) has bought over a million extra shares . The Newcastle United owner has been prevented from buying more shares by SFA dual interest regulations and angered fans by posting advance notice of a plan to take Ibrox as security against a potential £10million loan. 'That club is going backwards,' adds Green, 'the fans are the greatest asset Rangers have, the fanbase. 'What you have to have with any club is unity. 'Man United didn't like it when Glazer took over. 'But Glazer put more money into that club than Martin Edwards ever did. 'This is what you have to do – stand back and judge people. And Ashley and his team have done nowt wrong.' The future of the Scottish giants remains uncertain following continuing financial problems . Strongly defending his own record after the £22million raised by a share issue in December 2012 was swallowed up by losses of £1million a month and a rampant culture of boardroom pay-offs Green insists: 'My salary was £360,000 a year. It was going to be double that when we were in the SPL. 'When we were thrown out of the SPL I halved my salary. 'Ally McCoist refused to – so he kept his £760,000. 'I thought as Chief Executive I would get the same as Martin Bain, who was on the same as I was on. 'But I reduced my salary and was paid 12 months' notice as my contract allowed me. 'I was entitled to stock options twice my salary and I never took them. 'So all this rubbish that Charles Green raped and pillaged that club is not true. 'When I left Rangers there was over £18million in the bank. Green alleged that Ally McCoist ignored the club's delicate financial situation and refused to take a pay cut . 'Go and get a copy of the bank statement. I left, on April 13 - driven out by the board. 'They didn't want me there because of the Craig Whyte issue, which we can't talk about. I left so the club could move forwards – it has gone backwards.' Further denying widespread internet rumours of his arrest by Police Scotland in connection with an investigation into the takeover of the club three years ago Green insisted: 'No, I haven't. 'I have met Police Scotland on two occasions in connection with the previous ownership of the club. 'It is an ongoing investigation and it was nothing to do with my running of the club. 'Just let's be clear. I raised £35million for that club when it was in a much worse condition than it is today. 'When I was sat at meetings with (Hibs chairman) Rod Petrie who was saying, 'oh well, just hand the titles back, hand the cups back.' 'I wouldn't do that. I fought for Rangers...'","Ex-Rangers chief Charles Green defended the existing hierarchy at Ibrox .

"They say blood is thicker than water but that does not ring true for Kyle Walker, with the Tottenham right-back's own family hoping he slips up against Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup semi-finals. Born and raised in the Steel City, the 24-year-old makes no secret of his Yorkshire roots and his love for the Blades, even going to Wembley last season to watch their FA Cup semi-final against Hull. Walker spent many weekends as a child at Bramall Lane with his grandfather watching his idols Brian Deane and Peter Ndlovu, before stepping out on the hallowed turf himself. Kyle Walker, pictured playing for Tottenham at the weekend, is looking ahead to facing his old club . Walker (left) - and Spurs - face Sheffield United, the club he grew up supporting, in the Capital One Cup . The right-back remains a dyed-in-the-wool Blade despite only making a handful of appearances before leaving in 2009 for Spurs, who he will on Wednesday be hoping to help reach the Capital One Cup final at his boyhood club's expense. 'It's such an important game, especially for me,' Walker said. 'It's not going to be easy. Hopefully we can get a comfortable lead here because this is our patch, but we need to play the football we have been playing in recent weeks. 'It is going to be a far from easy tie, especially up at Bramall Lane. They will chuck everything at us up there. 'I have obviously supported the club since I was a boy and played for the club before I came here. 'I know their spirit and what the coaches will want. It's going to take a lot of hard work for us to get to Wembley.' Walker, pictured playing for the Blades against Burnley in the 2009 Playoff Final at Wembley - Burnley won 1-0 . Walker admits he grew up watching the likes of Brian Deane (right, pictured in 1997/98) at Bramall Lane . This will be just the second time Walker has played United, having featured at Bramall Lane in an FA Cup third-round tie when on loan at Aston Villa four years ago. 'I played for my first game on loan for Aston Villa against United in the cup and scored,' the right-back said. 'Not only that but it was with my left foot. 'I think as a professional footballer you have to do your job. My heart will always be with Sheffield United but I am a Tottenham player and they are my club.' There are no such split loyalties for Walker's family, though. 'No (they won't be cheering me on) - they are Sheffield United fans,' he said. 'Seriously. 'They obviously support me and want me to do well, but they will be wanting Sheffield United to go through, although it is a bit of a win-win situation for them because either way they will go to Wembley.' Walker inspects the Selhurst Park pitch ahead of Spurs' game against Crystal Palace . Walker in action for Sheffield United Under 18s against Huddersfield Under 18s in January 2007 . Even his three-year-old son, Roman, is a United fan - 'I'm a Blade so he's a Blade,' Walker said - and will be among the friends and family at White Hart Lane on Wednesday. The full-back was inundated with messages and phone calls after the draw pitted Spurs against United - with the interest so intense that he outsourced ticket requests to his mother. 'I had to put a deadline on them,' he said. 'My mum has been dealing with all the requests from family and friends and she told them they all had to get in touch with her by a certain date or else they would be left disappointed. 'They had a couple of weeks to contact my mum before the cut-off point. 'Luckily everything went through my mum's phone so I didn't have to deal with it. I can't remember exactly how many I've got coming to the first game but I know there are 17 in the away end and the rest are in with the Tottenham fans.'","Tottenham face Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup semi-final .

"Chris Eubank Jnr is considering heading to America to prepare for his next fight in the belief that sparring partners are running scared after watching him go toe-to-toe with WBA and IBF super middleweight champion Carl Froch. The middleweight faces Russia’s Dmitry Chudinov for the WBA interim middleweight title, on the undercard of Tyson Fury versus Christian Hammer, at London’s 02 Arena on February 28. The fight will be Eubank’s first since suffering his first defeat to Billy Joe Saunders last November. Chris Eubank Jnr (right) goes toe-to-toe with Carl Froch early last year . Eubank says sparring partners have been scared off after watching the footage . He maintains he should have got the decision over the British, Commonwealth and European champion, but that his preparations for that fight had been undermined by a difficulty sourcing sparring partners since the emergence of video footage of him sparring with Froch before his rematch with George Groves at Wembley last May. ‘Since I sparred with Froch and the footage went online, it’s been hell to get any type of sparring partner,’ said Eubank. ‘They’ve seen me perform against a world-level fighter, standing toe-to-toe, not backing down – and he’s a super middleweight, I’m a middleweight. ‘Fighters have seen that and thought “Maybe I should find somebody else to work with”. Eubank sparred with Froch before his rematch with George Groves at Wembley last May . ‘If I find myself in a situation like my last fight where sparring partners are scarce, then I will go over to the States, because sparring is number one. ‘If I don’t have what I need then I will have to go.’ Eubank lost a split decision to Saunders in a fight that divided opinion but promoter Frank Warren plans to stage a rematch between them in the summer. ‘I’m not using (a lack of sparring) as an excuse for the fact I didn’t come away with the decision, because I feel like I performed better than Saunders did in the fight,' he said. Eubank will bid to bounce back from defeat to Billy Joe Saunders against Dmitry Chudinov in February . ‘With Carl (Froch), I travelled up to Sheffield, a four-and-a-half hour drive. I’d made the trip because I wanted to test myself. ‘Unfortunately I guess not everyone in the business has that mindset. Some guys want easy sparring, they don’t want their confidence knocked at all. ‘A lot of the time, because they don’t want to spar, the only way for me to spar is to travel across England to different gyms, in different cities and towns. That way they’ll do it, they feel more at home in their gyms.’ Fury v Hammer and Eubank v Chudinov is live on BoxNation on February 28.","Chris Eubank Jnr might head to the USA to find a sparring partner .

That’s really become the focus for me.’ Casey played in three successive Ryder Cups from 2004 and was unlucky not to get a wild card in 2010, when he was the world No 7. He could decide to rejoin the European Tour next year but, with the Ryder Cup qualifying process beginning in September, he would be giving everyone else a four-month head start. Ironically enough, his decision comes against the background of leading American Patrick Reed going the other way and committing to membership of the European Tour, with Rickie Fowler likely to follow suit. Casey (centre right) with other members of Europe's Ryder Cup winning team at the K Club in 2006 . Casey became the only man ever to win a Ryder Cup match with a hole-in-one at the K Club . However, to be fair to Casey, their circumstances are different. The two Americans are comfortably ranked inside the world’s top 50, and so gain entry to all the majors and WGC events that count for membership on both tours. Casey is presently ranked 70th, and it’s much harder to play both tours with that ranking, where there are no guarantees. Casey acknowledged it was difficult to miss the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship, where he has won twice in the past. ‘I stewed over that one for a long time and believe me it wasn’t a decision that I took lightly,’ he said. While one course specialist is absent, another has set an imposing target for everyone else over the weekend. Martin Kaymer has already won this event three times and has become a hot favourite to win it again after following up his brilliant first round 64 with a 67 on Friday to reach a fabulous total of 13 under par. In winning the US Open last June he showed what a formidable frontrunner he is when he built on two opening rounds of 65 to walk away from the field over the weekend. It would be no surprise if he repeated the trick. Kaymer built up a five-shot advantage over the other players in his half of the field and piled on the pressure on the likes of world No 1 Rory McIlroy and Rickie Fowler, who were both late starters on Friday and who began their second rounds at five under. One high-profile player who couldn’t keep pace was Kaymer’s playing partner, Justin Rose. He finished on a total of two under after a second round 69 and faced an anxious wait to see if it was good enough to make the halfway cut.","Paul Casey has resigned his membership of the European Tour .

"Serena Williams celebrated her 100th consecutive week as world No 1 by taking a step closer to another milestone in the Australian Open. Williams joined Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert on 18 grand slam titles with her US Open victory last year and a 19th would take her within three of the record held by Steffi Graf. The top seed will face far tougher challenges than that posed by Belgian world number 106 Alison Van Uytvanck as the tournament progresses, but she was nevertheless delighted to secure a 6-0 6-4 win on Margaret Court Arena.

'I always have first-round jitters and nerves but it's good to come out here and win today,' said Williams, whose current spell at the top of the rankings started on February 18, 2013. 'It's in the back of my mind (a 19th title) but at the same time there are so many other players who want to win this tournament as well. 'If I could get to 19 in Australia that would be beyond amazing. I have a lot of work to do but I am just going to enjoy myself.'

Wozniacki will take on two-time winner Victoria Azarenka on Thursday after the Belarusian, who is unseeded after a miserable 2014 on and off the court, defeated American Sloane Stephens 6-3 6-2. 'Being an unseeded player it's not a surprise that I have a tough draw or tough opponents in the early round,' Azarenka said. 'I just need to go through that. I accept the challenges.

Wozniacki added: 'Yeah, it's going to be tough. She's won here before. But at the same time I'm just going to focus on myself, my own game.

"Aljaz Bedene showed glimpses of the talent he could soon be parading as a British passport holder before bowing out of the Australian Open at the hands of four-time champion Novak Djokovic. The 25-year-old Slovenian is a resident of Welwyn Garden City and is awaiting the outcome of his application to become a British citizen. He was eventually swatted away by world No 1 Djokovic, who prevailed 6-3, 6-2. 6-4 on Rod Laver Arena to get his 11th campaign at Melbourne Park under way. VIDEO Scroll down for Australian Open: Novak Djokovic wins in straight sets 6-3, 6-2. 6-4 . Novak Djokovic looked in good form as he beat Aljaz Bedene in straight sets . The World No 1 celebrates his victory as he looks to win his fifth Australian Open title . Bedene, who two years ago reached his career-high ranking of 71st, jumped 40 places to his current position at number 116 by reaching the recent Chennai final, where he lost to reigning Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka. And the confidence he took from that performance in India was reflected in the early proceedings as Bedene kept pace with Djokovic until the eighth game. He even drove three successive aces beyond the Serbian, showing no sign of stage fright on the tournament's biggest stadium court. Djokovic was given a test by Bedene but progressed without too many problems . Djokovic's coach watched the world No 1 from the stands of the Rod Laver Arena .

And in swiftly closing out the set, Djokovic imposed the tempo for the rest of the contest, his tentative start soon forgotten as he raced through the second in 27 minutes and broke decisively in the fifth game of the third to move within sight of victory. A love service game completed the task for a player who despite recent illness looked sharp enough to suggest he will again be a title contender. This was Bedene's seventh appearance in the first round of a grand slam, and he has yet to win a match at the level.

"Stan Wawrinka opened the defence of his Australian Open title in style, losing just seven games in his first-round match on Tuesday. The Swiss took one hour and 29 minutes to see off Turkish world No 100 Marsel Ilhan 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 on Rod Laver Arena, the scene of his maiden Grand Slam triumph against Rafael Nafal last year.

The world No 4 came racing out of the blocks and needed just 20 minutes to wrap up the first set against a player who has never progressed past the second round of a Grand Slam.

'For sure it's great but it's still the beginning of the tournament. It's just one match, now I need to be ready for the next one.' Wawrinka is on a good run of form after ending his year with a first Davis Cup title for Switzerland and then starting 2015 by winning the Aircel Chennai Open a fortnight ago.

"A sparkling 50-1 treble for Godolphin lit up a dramatic first day’s racing at Chelmsford City as the reborn all-weather track was handed a number of ringing endorsements on its return. The Essex venue, formerly known as Great Leighs, closed in 2009 after going into administration less than a year after its opening. However, under the part-ownership of Betfred boss Fred Done, £15million has been invested on the re-launched circuit since it was purchased in December 2013. Godolphin (front) in action during the Kempton Park racecourse in July 2014 . Tryster got the ball rolling for Godolphin trainer Charlie Appleby in the opening Betfred Handicap, but not before the 2-1 favourite had swerved violently across the track after hitting the front under Adam Kirby, impeding short-head runner-up Gaelic Silver in the process. Thankfully for favourite-backers, Kirby survived a stewards’ enquiry to secure a place in the history books. Kirby said: ‘He’s still very green. He looked at something in the straight and had a bit of a duck out. He wasn’t at full stretch at the line, though, and still had loads underneath.’ The nature of the new surface was a little unexpected for Kirby, who went on to complete a double aboard the Appleby-trained Blue Aegean in the Weatherbys Printing Handicap an hour later. He said: ‘I thought it was a bit deep and on the slow side. I don’t remember it being like that but it is a nice surface — perfect.’ Godolphin completed their treble courtesy of a smart five-length victory in the Fast-Track Qualifier for the Robert Havlin-ridden Tempus Temporis, trained by John Gosden, who had struck earlier on the card with Zamoura in the fillies’ maiden. Ed Dunlop (left) praised everyone involved for getting the Essex venue up and running again . Havlin said: ‘My fella enjoyed the turns here as every time I felt he was coming back under me we started turning and he was taking me back into the bridle. The track is excellent for that with its sweeping turns.’ Newmarket trainer Ed Dunlop, out of luck in the fillies’ maiden, was another to welcome the course’s return. He said: ‘The place has been derelict for a number of years but they have done a great job and the prize money looks good, which is important. ‘It is a purpose-built venue, very close to Newmarket and it is very easy to get to if we want to gallop horses.’ Elsewhere, Ayr has abandoned Monday’s jumps fixture after a severe storm caused structural damage to parts of the course, while tomorrow’s meeting at Ffos Las is in doubt because of a waterlogged track.","Godolphin was in impressive form on the opening day of races at Chelmsford City on Sunday .

"Edinburgh Rugby are facing a fight to keep Scotland international Tim Visser, with a host of clubs pursuing the signature of the prolific winger. Sportsmail can reveal that, although contract talks have opened with the SRU, the 27-year-old has yet to sign an extended deal. That has alerted clubs from the Aviva Premiership, the Top 14 in France and also in the southern hemisphere to his possible availability. Edinburgh Rugby's Tim Visser is yet to sign a new contract with the club, alerting potential suitors . The Scotland wing, pictured scoring against France in March 2013, will be much sought-after . Losing one of Scotland's top finishers would be a big blow to the rebuilding plans of Edinburgh head coach Alan Solomons, who is believed to be keen for Visser to remain at the club. But the question is whether the SRU will be able to match the big-money offers sure to come his way over the next few months. Sportsmail understands the player is keen to have his future settled sooner rather than later to allow him to concentrate fully on Scotland's 2015 Rugby World Cup campaign. Dutch-born Visser, who made history by becoming the first man to play for Scotland through the three-year residency rule, has been looking back to his best over the past few months following an injury-hit season. His two tries in the 20-8 win over Glasgow Warriors earlier this month helped secure a vital Guinness PRO12 win for his side and the 1872 Cup - contested by the clubs on an annual basis. Visser also scored in Saturday's European Challenge Cup defeat to Lyon. Dutch-born Visser qualified to play for Scotland through the three-year residency rule in 2012 . The big winger, who joined Edinburgh back in 2009 and made his Scotland debut against Fiji three years later, is a firm favourite of the fans who will be hoping that he remains at the club past the summer. Meanwhile, Solomons will be grateful for some home comforts this week ahead of the European showdown with Bordeaux-Begles. A 75th-minute drop goal in Lyon inflicted a first defeat in five games of Pool 4 on the capital club, who must now win Friday night's clash against the group' s other French outfit. It was always likely to come down to the last round but defeat in Lyon has possibly denied Edinburgh the safety net of qualifying as a runner-up. Head coach Solomons was in forgiving mood in France after watching a demanding schedule take its toll on his players and their Challenge Cup ambitions. Visser (left) tries to help team-mate Alasdair Dickinson (right) tackle Munster's James Coughlan . The day-long journey to Matmut Stadium came on the back of a trip to Galway, never the simplest of ventures, and a busy festive period that featured back-to-back derbies against Glasgow. Solomons believes playing in Lyon proved a bridge too far for his drained players. He said: 'The reasons we lost were relatively simple - we made too many errors and gave away too many penalties. 'Probably 18 of their 21 points came through a combination of those two issues. But you have to look at the reasons behind that as to why we were not at our best. 'That was our ninth game on the bounce. We had two massive games against Glasgow over Christmas, then were away to Connacht, that involves a flight and three-hour bus journey, and then immediately away in France. 'That has all been physically and mentally draining on the players, who were unable to peak once again. They were fatigued.' Visser (left), Edinburgh's try scorer, challenges Lyon's Fabrice Estebabenez for the ball during the 21-19 loss . Solomons could forgive the fatigue but not the indiscipline from his players, which proved decisive. Visser and Dougie Fife both crossed in the opening 25 minutes to hand Edinburgh a dream start that should have paved the way for a second successive win on French soil. But Matt Scott paid the price for his team's collective indiscretions with a yellow card which handed Lyon a route back. Their 13-3 lead was narrowed to 13-10 when Romain Loursac touched down and Lyon found belief, capitalising on Edinburgh's growing number of handling errors despite three kicks from Sam Hidalgo-Clyne. This was a missed opportunity but Solomons has hammered home to his players that their destiny remains in their own hands. Visser is tackled by Wales' Jamie Roberts while playing for Scotland in the 2013 Six Nations . 'We are disappointed to lose because that was a game we felt we should have won, despite being off our game,' he added. 'But one of the first things I told the players in the dressing room is that we are still top of the pool and still in control. 'We still have everything to play for next weekend and we are determined to put things right. Hopefully, we will have a big home crowd backing us - like the one we had against Glasgow.' 'It's going to be my job to make sure we recover in the right way this week and that the players are physically and mentally fresh for a big game.'","Tim Visser has yet to sign a new contract with Edinburgh Rugby .

"I had mixed emotions at the end of Glasgow Warriors’ victory over Montpellier on Sunday. The main feeling was one of disappointment that Glasgow didn’t gain the bonus point after failing to get over the line for a fourth try. But it just proves how far the side have progressed that a convincing win over a top French side is regarded as a disappointment. They dominated large parts of the game and really should have got the bonus point - but maybe not by the way they went about it. Game management is vital; it is what all stand-offs need to be good at as it falls to them to ensure their team plays in the right areas of the pitch. Glasgow Warriors' DTH van der Merwe jumps into the air to celebrate his hat-trick try against Montpellier . Van der Merwe touches down his third try during Glasgow's 21-10 victory on Sunday . But game management comes from the leadership within the team, too, and this is where I felt Glasgow got things wrong in the first half. Everyone knew they needed to win the game by scoring four tries to give themselves a better chance of qualifying for the quarter-finals - and the intent was there at the start of the game. It worked initially as they got the first try after 12 minutes but it was what happened next that was the problem. They squandered many kicks at goal, choosing to kick to touch and try to get more tries, but they just didn’t come. It is a nightmare scenario for Josh Strauss as captain because, once you have made the decision to go for the tries, and they don’t come, what do you do next? Keep going or revert to kicking the points? Glasgow kept going but their accuracy and execution let them down. In ideal conditions for throwing in, the lineout malfunctioned, which didn’t provide any platform. Van der Merwe (second right) is congratulated by team-mates after touching down his hat-trick try . The irony is that last week against the Scarlets, with a howling crosswind, the lineouts were impeccable. That made yesterday’s display more surprising. When you chase the tries early, well before the game is actually won, it changes not just the tactics used but also the mindset of the team. This may be one of the reasons that the lineout didn’t function properly; they were thinking about how they were going to score before they had secured the ball first. The reality is that if they had scored one more try before half-time, everyone would have been happy but they didn’t and these are the fine margins that you need to deal with at this level. James Eddie of Glasgow Warriors wins a lineout against Montpellier at Scotstoun on Sunday . Glasgow scored the third try with 10 minutes to go, so they had a chance to make it a successful day all round but they just could not find that spark to get the all-important fourth. Bonus points are key to qualifying for the knockout stages and, especially in the early rounds, you don’t know how important they will be if you miss one until you get down to the business end of the process. They will definitely have to beat Bath at the Rec and, depending on other results, they might now need to win with four tries - much harder. Thomas Bianchin of Montpellier (centre) tries to evade Glasgow prop Jon Welsh (second right) They might also have to do this without their captain and talisman Strauss, who was stretchered off on Sunday and it didn’t look good. Meanwhile, Edinburgh missed a golden opportunity to qualify for the knockout stage of the Challenge Cup with one game to spare when they narrowly lost to Lyon in France. All is not lost as, if they beat Bordeaux Begles next week at Murrayfield, they will top the group and be in the quarter-finals. Edinburgh have shown huge improvement over the last month or so and I expect them to win that game next week.

"England planned to welcome back an old friend on Sunday when Andrew Flintoff was due to join them at their practice at the Gabba for his first involvement with the national team since he limped away from the 2009 Ashes. Flintoff’s extraordinary comeback, which started with Lancashire last season and extended to the Brisbane Heat Big Bash team, now includes him putting in an appearance at England’s practice ahead of their tri-series game against India. Before anyone gets too carried away it should be stressed that Flintoff has been asked to join the England team by coach Peter Moores not to bowl but to chat to the younger players and allow them to pick his brains. Andrew Flintoff, pictured playing for the Brisbane Heat, will join England for a practice session on Sunday . Flintoff bays during the Big Bash League match between the Heat and Perth Scorchers . Flintoff remains one of the best death-ball bowlers in international one-day cricket over the last 20 years . It is felt that Flintoff, who has hinted that his comeback will come to an end after the Big Bash is concluded next week, will be a positive presence for a young England team still rebuilding after the upheaval of the last year. It is unclear whether Flintoff, who has struggled to make an impression with Brisbane, was going to take part in training but he remains one of the best death bowlers in one-day cricket of the last 20 years and could surely pass on a tip or two. The appearance of one of the legends of the 2005 Ashes series would give England a boost after their defeat in the tri-series opener against Australia and with them now desperately needing to beat India at the Gabba on Tuesday. Ian Bell (left) walks off after being dismissed during England's opening tri-series loss to Australia . They received another setback yesterday when it was revealed that Gary Ballance broke the little finger of his right hand during fielding practice in Canberra ahead of the tri-series against Australia and India. While it must be considered unfortunate that a player who has not featured in the first three games of this tour should pick up an injury England will not replace Ballance even though he is unlikely to be fit for the rest of the tri-series. England are confident that their reserve batsman will be fit for the World Cup so will give James Taylor every chance to cement his place at No3 rather than rush in a replacement player just for the last three matches of this series. Flintoff holds the 2005 Ashes aloft following the Oval Test match after the famous series . Eoin Morgan, England's one-day captain, top scored during the loss to Australia with 121 runs . Someone who still maintains he would welcome a call-up, unlikely though it is, is Kevin Pietersen, who yesterday became the highest scorer in the Australian Twenty20 competition this season when he hit 67 from 42 balls In Melbourne Stars victory over Sydney Thunder. Yet there was no rush here to call in Pietersen to a net session as Moores and Stuart Broad, who extended the invitation, have done with Flintoff.

"Burnley are facing up to the prospect of losing Danny Ings in the next five months for as little as £206,000. The Clarets are heavily indebted to their striker’s goals so far this season but, with a number of European clubs chasing the 22-year-old, are destined to part ways. Ings has netted six times for Sean Dyche’s side – five of which have contributed directly to the winning of points – and Sportsmail understands he is receptive to a move abroad in a bid to broaden his career. Danny Ings has scored six goals for Burnley this season but he may still ending up leaving the club . A number of clubs in Germany’s Bundesliga are interested in landing Ings, while the Independent claim he is a target for David Moyes at Real Sociedad. Moyes would not be drawn on any interest on Friday, saying: 'I can't comment on individual players because I don't want to destabilise my club or another club, but I do know that Loren (Juarros, sporting director) and Jokin (Aperribay, club president) are working very hard to bring in players.' The former Bournemouth man is available on a free transfer at the end of the season, with Burnley so far failing to tie him down to a new contract. While the Premier League new boys are still due a sizeable cash windfall should Ings move to another English club, that is not the case should he seal a switch elsewhere. A number of European sides are chasing Ings and Sportsmail understands he is receptive to a move abroad . Premier League teams would have to pay as much as £6million for Ings if they took him on a free . Any European team can land the England Under 21 international for a measly £206,000 because of FIFA compensation rules – worked out due to the number of seasons Ings has played at Turf Moor. He has been free to talk to clubs on the continent from the beginning of the month and is due a chunky signing-on fee if he clinches a move away. Premier League teams would have to pay as much as £6million if they took him on a free. Unlike many other young English players, Ings doesn’t feel he necessarily has to be plying his trade in the domestic top flight.","Danny Ings is being chased by a number of European clubs .

"CLICK HERE to see which famous faces turned out to watch the game . OJ Mayo led the way with 22 points from the bench as the Milwaukee Bucks thrashed the New York Knicks 95-79 in front of a sold-out crowd of over 18,500 at the O2 Arena. The 27-year-old guard was one of five Milwaukee players in double figures as they cruised past the Knicks on Thursday night in London. Brandon Knight also had 20 points, while Giannis Antetokounmpo (16), Khris Middleton (14) and Zaza Pachulia (11) also reached double figures in another impressive team performance by Jason Kidd’s side. The defeat for the Knicks was their 16th in a row and 26th in their last 27 matches. It was also a third straight loss against the Bucks this season.

Milwaukee guard O.J. Mayo (top) top scored for the Bucks from the bench to condemn the Knicks to a 16th straight defeat . Even the return of the Knicks' star player Carmelo Anthony (left) could not prevent them from ending their dismal losing steak . The New York Knicks' slump this season has seen them lose 26 of 27 games . ‘It’s not good enough and we have to get better,’ New York Knicks head coach said. ‘We have to work harder than what we are and put more time and effort in to get the results that we want. ‘We have played against this team four times including pre-season and they’re just better than us.’ Thursday night’s game was the fifth regular-season contest to be staged at the arena in south London since 2011, and one of the most one-sided. Two years is a very long time in basketball. In January 2013, the Knicks came to London and brushed aside a Detroit Pistons side 102-87 on their way to finishing second behind the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference. This team is not even a shadow of that side, and they return home with their league-worst record at a dire 5-36 with their next win seemingly a world away. Even the return of Carmelo Anthony - their superstar player – from injury couldn’t keep things close against a young, dynamic Bucks side that moved to 21-19 for the season and remained well and truly on course for a play-off spot in the Eastern Conference. London fans will at least be happy that Anthony was on the court after making the long trip over having missed the previous six games with a knee injury. Anthony played 27 minutes and scored 25 points, but they were all in vain for the London 2012 Olympic basketball gold medallist. It was a superstar’s performance from Anthony in a losing effort in front of some football superstars, including Thierry Henry, Didier Drogba, Cesc Fabregas and Jack Wilshere. But Anthony’s efforts were nowhere near enough for this struggling New York team on Thursday at the O2 Arena.

Just three minutes into the game, an alley-oop pass from Knight to ‘Greek freek’ Antetokounmpo had the Bucks off to a 12-0 head start, and with just give minutes played, New York head coach Fisher had already burned two timeouts with his team 14-0 behind. ‘It is just a recurring act,’ Anthony said. ‘The same things are happening over and over again. I wasn’t expecting to be 14 points down but it happened and we are the only people who can control that. ‘We have dug ourselves in a deep hole right now, so the only thing we can do is keep trying to get better.’ Tim Hardaway Jr finally got the Knicks on the board midway through the first quarter and it sparked a 7-0 run that got New York back within touching distance. But a 12-0 run towards the end of the period propelled the Bucks into what seemed like an already unassailable 31-13 lead at the end of the first quarter. Already, at that stage, it was just a matter of how many the Bucks would win by. Milwaukee  main man Brando Knight dribbles past Langston Galloway as the Bucks open up a massive lead .

The Knicks did at least manage to put up a better fight in the second period, but Milwaukee still edged it 25-24 to take a dominant 56-37 lead into half-time. To have any chance of getting back into the game, New York needed to start the second half fast and eat away at Milwaukee’s big lead. But it was the Bucks who kept their foot firmly on the accelerator, scoring the first six points of the third quarter, by the end of which their lead had stretched to 82-56. Coach Fisher decided enough was enough for Anthony on his return for injury. After playing 27 minutes in three periods, his night was done with the Knicks’ chances of victory gone. ‘He hadn’t played for a couple weeks and with the knee situation we were trying to be as smart as possible there,’ Fisher said about pulling Anthony. ‘With the game where it was I thought it was a good time to give him a rest.’ Anthony added: ‘I feel my body responded very well. I had a chance to get some rest and the two-week programme we implemented at the beginning of the year really paid off.’ ‘It was regular rotation at the end of the third quarter and then it was a coach decision but overall I felt pretty good.’ Jared Dudley of Milwaukee Bucks and New York's Lou Amundsen compete for a rebound as the Knicks fall further behind .

It was a third straight win for Bucks head coach Kidd at the O2 Arena having been a Knicks player in 2013, and coach of the Nets in 2014 for their victories in London. ‘I love the international atmosphere,’ Kidd said. ‘As a player and a coach I’ve had some success and been very fortunate. Coming international I’ve always enjoyed being able to showcase my talent as a player and also watching the greatest players play basketball.’","Milwaukee Bucks defeated New York Knicks 95-79 in the fifth regular-season NBA contest that London has staged .

"There was a time when Chris Woakes was a peripheral figure with England, seemingly destined to be a nearly man not quite good enough at the highest level with either ball or bat. Not any more. Now Woakes, after taking his chance in Sri Lanka and in the first match of the tri-series against Australia in Sydney on Friday, has become the most important bowling name on England’s World Cup team-sheet. That is some achievement when you consider that England have Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, Chris Jordan and, as long as he can regain fitness, Jimmy Anderson at their disposal for a one-day tour that began with defeat at the SCG. Chris Woakes poses for a portrait after a press conference in Brisbane on Saturday . Woakes has emerged as a key England bowler ahead of the World Cup next month . Matches: 25 . Wickets: 34 . Best figures: 6-45 . Average: 30.18 . Economy: 5.84 . Strike rate: 31.0 . England showed how valuable Woakes has become in 50-over cricket when he took the new ball ahead of Broad in Sydney, returned at the death and responded by being the most successful and quickest bowler on show. It was not enough to enable England to defend the meagre 234 all out that saw the wounds of the traumatic Ashes tour re-opened by Australia but it was a promising sign of what Woakes can deliver in the World Cup challenges to come. ‘Yes I hope so,’ said Woakes yesterday when asked if he finally felt established, at 25, with England. ‘Sri Lanka was good for me and, with Jimmy and Broady not being around, it gave guys who have not played as much an opportunity to stake a claim. ‘I felt like I did that there and I’m trying to continue it here. It is nice to know that I’ve performed well at international level now. I’ve been in and out and haven’t known if I was going to play or not. It does help if you know you’ve got a good chance of playing. It’s a confidence booster.’ Woakes celebrates as he takes the wicket of Glenn Maxwell during the tri-series defeat by Australia on Friday . The Warwickshire all-rounder is congratulated after dismissing Aaron Finch during Friday's defeat . England travelled to Brisbane on Friday to face that other one-day powerhouse in India on Tuesday and it was at the Gabba four years ago that Woakes announced himself with a six-wicket haul against Australia. It has taken since then for him to fulfil his obvious potential and it was another six-wicket return against Sri Lanka in Kandy before Christmas – which made Woakes the first England bowler to take two six-wicket one-day hauls – that convinced England he is now the real deal. In Sydney he added another four wickets in the key scalps of David Warner, Aaron Finch, George Bailey and Glenn Maxwell but, sadly, not before Warner had hit the century that confirmed Australia as the team to beat in the World Cup. ‘I thought we bowled reasonably okay and it would have been nice to have a bigger total to defend but unfortunately it wasn’t to be,’ said Woakes. Woakes took four wickets in the opening match of the tri-series, but it wasn't enough as England lost . The 25-year-old shares a high-five with wicket keeper Jos Butler after taking the wicket of David Warner . ‘They were trying to finish the game in a hurry which gave opportunities and to pick up wickets was brilliant. I felt I bowled well with the new ball and got my rewards later on.’ Clearly, the ‘yard’ of pace that the Warwickshire all-rounder has added to his bowling, as well as the variety that saw him successfully mix it up at the death in Sydney, has been the key to his new-found senior status. ‘Looking at the big screen, I saw I was bowling at around 140 kph (87 miles per hour),’ said Woakes. ‘Probably 18 months ago I was only bowling at 130, 132, 134 max. I definitely feel I’ve put on a yard. Maybe a bit more than 140 occasionally. It’s good for me to see. ‘It has been a gradual process. I’ve been working on it for a couple of years now, starting with Graeme Welch at Warwickshire and Kevin Shine at Loughborough during my Lions period. There were a few technical issues to sort out and I also feel now I’m more energetic in my run up. So there has been hard work and it hasn’t just happened overnight. It’s good to see the rewards.’ Woakes has his eyes on the ball as he prepares to take a catch to dismiss Shane Watson . Woakes, who admits he now feels established with England, safely holds on to the ball . Woakes is very much a three-dimensional cricketer too. He is a dangerous lower middle order hitter and an athletic fielder, even if he did nearly make a hash of a straightforward chance that came his way during England’ s tour match win against a Prime Minister’s XI in Canberra. Woakes juggled the catch on the boundary, went to ground and kicked it up, football style, before pouching it, to his immense relief. ‘You’re not going to believe me but I reckon I meant to do it,’ said Woakes. ‘I misjudged the catch to begin with, so I made a meal of it, then as soon as it was rolling down my leg, I tried to kick the ball to get it up. Fortunately it came back to me and stuck. ‘I thought it was my right foot but everybody says it was my left. It definitely hit my boot. I’m a Villa fan. Perhaps they could do with me at the moment.’ The emergence of Woakes, who also played in the last three Tests of last summer against India, has been important for England. Anderson needs to play on Tuesday to ease concerns that he is struggling to regain full fitness after missing the Sri Lanka tour to rest his troublesome knee. Woakes juggles the ball off his feet before taking a catch during the tour match win against Prime Minister's XI . Woakes has been working hard on his bowling action over the last two years to increase his pace . Meanwhile, Broad is still easing his way back to full fitness after knee surgery of his own, Jordan can be erratic and Steven Finn sadly still looks a shadow of the bowler who was among the best in the world in one-day cricket barely two years ago. He is getting better but, as his clattering into the stumps on Friday showed, Finn is far from over the problems that forced him to be sent home from Brisbane this time last year. Add the fact that Eoin Morgan seems to have reservations about the effectiveness of James Tredwell, hence his decision to leave him out on a dry, worn SCG pitch on Friday, and it is clear to see that England’s one-dimensional bowling is a bigger worry than the batting which failed them on Friday. The need for Woakes to carry on emerging as the unlikely leader of the one-day attack, then, is vitally important here for England.","Chris Woakes has been a peripheral figure with England in the past .

"England batsman Gary Ballance has fractured a finger but has been passed fit for the World Cup. Ballance, who was recalled to the one-day squad as a replacement for dropped former captain Alastair Cook, was struck on the little finger in his right hand during fielding drills in Canberra last week. The 25-year-old will remain with the side for the ongoing Tri-Series against Australia and India and no batting cover has been added. England batsman Gary Ballance has fractured his finger but will play in the forthcoming World Cup . Ballance will remain with the England squad for the upcoming tournament in Australia and New Zealand . England's Twitter account confirmed that Ballance had fractured his little finger during field practice . The Twitter account also confirmed that another player would not be called up to the squad . A brief England and Wales Cricket Board statement read: 'Gary Ballance has a fractured right little finger, sustained during fielding practice in Canberra. Ballance will be available for the ICC Cricket World Cup and therefore we will not be calling another player into the squad.' Ballance has yet to play since England arrived Down Under, with coach Peter Moores apparently set on his preferred batting order. Ballance and opener Alex Hales are the only members of the 15-man party who have not appeared in either warm-up match or Friday's three-wicket defeat by Australia. England coach Peter Moores has not yet played Ballance in England's World Cup warm-up matches . Alex Hales has also yet to play in England's preparations matches in Australia . It is not yet known whether Ballance will be available before the end of the current series, with England next in action against India on Tuesday. England's reluctance to summon a replacement suggests they are not overly concerned about the injury, but have already indicated that any call-ups to the existing squad would likely come from the Lions party in South Africa. That squad is being captained by Jonathan Trott, who is also the form batsman having hit a double century against South Africa A in Paarl. Whether or not he is currently deemed ready for a full international return, having not featured since leaving last winter's Ashes with a stress-related condition, is unclear.","Gary Ballance has fractured his right little finger in fielding practice .

"Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew believes once striker Dwight Gayle finds his inner confidence he will be a real handful for Barclays Premier League defences. The 24-year-old, who was playing for Conference North side Bishop's Stortford three and a half years ago, scored twice as the Eagles came from 2-0 down to beat Burnley 3-2 at Turf Moor. He has now scored in Palace's last three matches - since Pardew arrived from Newcastle - and his manager has high hopes for him. Gayle struggles to contain his delight as he runs to celebrate his late winner with the travelling Palace fans . 'He just seems a very uncomplicated player,' he said. 'He is very straightforward in his work; he is quick, good in the air, good attitude - blimey there is not much more you want. 'All he needs is experience and to grow in his confidence. 'When I had Jason Puncheon at Southampton he wasn't the player he is today. 'Because he has played in the Premier League he has that inner confidence he can play at this level and that is what players like Dwight Gayle need to find.' Crystal Palace striker Gayle halves Burnley's advantage with a clinical strike on Saturday . Puncheon was Palace's other goalscorer as they recovered from goals by Ben Mee, from a corner, and Danny Ings, who benefited from Scott Arfield out-muscling Joel Ward on the touchline, in the opening 16 minutes. 'I was disapponted in the first two goals,' added Pardew. 'I know the ball wasn't in the quadrant (corner) for the first goal but that is a lame excuse, we should have done better. 'The second goal was a foul and I think the referee and linesman were distracted by the fact was the ball in or out and didn't see the player just dump our defender on the pitch. 'Having said that we had to show tremendous qualities, not just fighting spirit and resilience - which I know is in the group - but flair and bravery to pass the ball which we did against a Burnley team who I thought were on their mettle.' Gayle celebrates his second and Crystal Palace's third as Alan Pardew's side fight back from two-goals down . Burnley boss Sean Dyche disagreed with his counterpart as, despite their early lead, he felt his players were not at their best and that is what cost them. 'We got a 2-0 lead and I didn't really feel comfortable with how the team was performing,' he said. 'We didn't start particularly well and we looked slightly off all the details we do well and if you don't do them well enough you will get hurt. 'It is probably a bit harsh on us to lose the game but they did well enough to win it and we've done that to other teams. 'I said to them afterwards if you come one per cent off the performance levels then you are not guaranteed anything, you have to play hard all the time, and we were just off and just off it too far for us at this level of football. 'The hardest thing in management is to snap teams out of that performance level when they are just below par. 'You can do it when there are two or three but when it is five or six it is more difficult. 'It wasn't a radically poor performance but they were just off their levels and for a team which is learning you can't afford to do that.'","Dwight Gayle has scored in all three games since Alan Pardew took over at Crystal Palace .

"Under-fire boss Paul Lambert has dismissed suggestions he is feeling the pressure at goalless Aston Villa after another defeat. They slipped to a 2-0 loss at home to Liverpool on Saturday and have not scored in eight hours and 42 minutes of action.

Paul Lambert says he is not feeling the pressure at Aston Villa despite poor form . Lambert (left) during the Champions League final in 1997, while playing for Borussia Dortmund . But Lambert, who won the Champions League as a player with Borussia Dortmund in 1997, insisted he knows how to handle the heat. 'Listen, if you saw me before the European Cup final that was pressure,' he said, after Villa drew a fifth straight league blank. 'I thought my a*** was going to fall out of my shorts. 'No, no. Pressure? High-level football? I'm fortunate, I've been at the top level playing in European Cup finals and things like that, so pressure is part and parcel of my nature. It's part and parcel of the game of football. Fabio Borini scores the opening goal against a hapless Aston Villa early on during the Premier League match . Lambert runs away in celebration after doubling Liverpool's lead with a little more than 10 minutes remaining . 'You have to handle it. I'm strong enough to handle it.' Fabio Borini and Rickie Lambert won it for Liverpool to underline Villa's struggles although a planned protest, against chairman Randy Lerner and Lambert from the home fans, failed to make an impact. The supporters may be unhappy, yet there were only muted chants against Lambert, and the manager insisted the club cannot compete on the level it used to.

"Sportsmail looks at the problems surrounding Roberto Martinez at Everton this term . Everton defender Leighton Baines admits the forthcoming warm-weather training break is a chance for players to generate a greater team spirit. A dire goalless draw at home to West Brom extended the Toffees' win-less run to eight matches and the England left-back accepts the growing criticism may have led some players to look after themselves. Cracks seemed to appear against the Baggies when Kevin Mirallas stepped up to take a penalty - traditionally the role of Baines with 15 successful conversions from 16 - and hit the post. Leighton Baines (centre) goes in for a challenge during Everton's 0-0 draw with West Brom . The Toffees have not won in eight games and currently sit four points above the relegation zone . Everton 0-0 West Brom . West Ham 2-2 Everton (lost on penalties) Everton 1-1 Manchester City . Everton 1-1 West Ham . Hull 2-0 Everton . Newcastle 3-2 Everton . Everton 0-1 Stoke . Southampton 3-0 Everton . Forwards Steven Naismith and Romelu Lukaku tried to persuade the Belgium international he was making a mistake and after his failure Lukaku could be seen publicly questioning his international team-mate with manager Roberto Martinez on the touchline. With no FA Cup action this weekend the squad are heading overseas for an intensive few days training and that break may now be more important than ever. 'It is like a mini pre-season in a way,' said Baines. 'We have been spending a lot of time together anyway but to go away is a nice change of scenery. 'Hopefully it gets a bit more spirit among the lads and keeps everyone together because when you are not winning games and there is a lot of criticism it is easy to look after yourself. 'We have to stay together and look after each other and hopefully this trip will be beneficial in all those ways.' The players will be challenged in a number of areas while they are away, not least in terms of why they have fallen so far off the pace they set last season. 'It is similar to what we did last season. We'll have some hard sessions in the morning and some tactical stuff in the afternoon,' he told evertontv. Kevin Mirallas (2nd left) demanded to take a penalty against the Baggies, despite Baines' reservations . The Belgium international reacts after missing the spot kick that would have ended Everton's dismal run . 'It is a chance to go away, take a step back and look at where we are going wrong because we are going wrong at the moment and it gives us more time together to put things right, . 'The intention is to have more opportunity to put more work in and cover some more points that we need to address so hopefully it will be beneficial.' Goodison Park has so often been Everton's stronghold but this season they have taken just 14 points from 11 matches and the West Brom display was arguably the worst seen at home under Martinez. Discontent is becoming more audible by the week but the Toffees boss could not say whether that was impacting on the players. 'It is difficult to answer that. We all share the same frustration,' he said. 'We want to win the game and perform well. The players had the perfect attitude and mindset that allowed us to control the game. 'You don't see many games in the Premier League when the opposition has no shots on target. 'The second half we all got frustrated, the players to the crowd and vice-versa.' Roberto Martinez watches on - his side have taken only 14 points from 33 at Goodison Park this term . By contrast, Tony Pulis has not lost a game or conceded a goal since arriving at the Hawthorns . The penalty furore took much of the focus away from another well-drilled West Brom performance which had all the hallmarks of new manager Tony Pulis. Since he took over earlier this month they have not conceded a goal in three matches and the former Stoke and Crystal Palace boss is still unbeaten. 'As a group you can't criticise them in any shape,' Pulis said. 'Everybody has bought into what we are trying to do. It takes time. 'This is a real struggle down at the bottom. There are so many good teams down there and I think it will go to the wire.'","Everton are leaving on an overseas break to boost Premier League season .

"Queens Park Rangers were left so concerned by new signing Mauro Zarate’s fitness that they contemplated pulling the plug on a loan deal with West Ham United. Zarate has played just 14 minutes of the club’s two fixtures since arriving and was an unused substitute in Saturday’s 2-0 home defeat by Manchester United. The results of Zarate’s fitness tests on arriving at Loftus Road are said to have stunned club staff to the point where they were having second thoughts about signing him. VIDEO Scroll down to see Mauro Zarate scoring for Velez Sarsfield . Mauro Zarate's severe lack of fitness almost convinced Queens Park Rangers not to sign him on loan . The striker has played just 14 minutes in two matches since he completed his loan from West Ham United . Redknapp has been told he can only make loan signings this month due to the restrictions the club have imposed on themselves to ensure they meet Financial Fair Play regulations, and deciding to go ahead with Zarate’s signing means QPR have already committed a substantial percentage of their wage budget this month. As a result, the Argentine has been placed on an intensive fitness regime - together with Adel Taarabt, who has his own fitness issues - to get him up to speed quickly. The fitness plan has seen the forward work closely with coach Glenn Hoddle and the club’s fitness staff. The gruelling schedule has also seen the 27-year-old come in on his days off and complete double training sessions at the club’s Harlington HQ. Adel Taarabt was left out of QPR's starting line-up against Manchester United, despite impressing at Burnley . Taarabt and Zarate have both been placed on a special training regime in order for them to improve fitness . Meanwhile, Redknapp has been assured his job is safe following talks with co-owner Tony Fernandes. Redknapp’s future has been called into question again in recent days, and Saturday’s defeat against United has not helped in quelling speculation. But Redknapp said: ‘I spoke to him yesterday (about the speculation) and he said, “What a load of rubbish!”.’ Harry Redknapp says he has been reassured by QPR owner Tony Fernandes his job is not under threat .","Mauro Zarate signed for Queens Park Rangers on a six-month loan deal .

"Harry Redknapp defiantly maintains he will spearhead QPR's January recruitment drive and Premier League survival fight, despite persistent rumours he faces the sack. The Rangers boss has targeted another forward, claiming 'I've only got two strikers' despite adding Mauro Zarate on loan to front men Bobby Zamora, Charlie Austin and Eduardo Vargas.

Harry Redknapp (right) watches on as Queens Park Rangers lost 2-0 to Manchester United at Loftus Road . The former Tottenham manager believes QPR chairman Tony Fernandes has paid no attention to an apparent club insider Redknapp claimed was undermining his job. 'What would happen to Sky if I'm not here on transfer window day?' Redknapp said of his own future and his ease with deadline-day interviews conducted through his car window. 'I spoke to Tony on Friday: We are looking for a loan, we need a striker. 'I've got Bobby (Zamora) and I've got Charlie (Austin), I've only got two strikers. 'Bobby can't last 90 minutes, he's fantastic Bobby Zamora, without Bobby none of us would probably be here now. 'What he did last year was incredible for the club, and he's a legend for the rest of his life isn't he here. 'But I need another striker; I need another front man really.'

Marouane Fellaini and James Wilson struck United's goals to condemn QPR to a sixth game without victory in all competitions on Saturday. Redknapp slammed rumoured board unrest, conceding he was battling rumours of the sack for the first time in his career. 'I've never had it before, never ever,' said Redknapp. 'I never had it at Tottenham, no one ever mentioned me getting the sack at Tottenham. 'So someone's written in the paper an insider, why don't they put his name in there? 'Everyone believes this insider has given them good information, but it's a lot of b******s isn't it really?

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal challenged misfiring loan striker Radamel Falcao to 'prove himself' in the build-up to Saturday's west London clash. The 28-year-old promptly wasted four prime chances to score, including twice failing to fire into an empty net. Despite another off-kilter display, United boss Van Gaal said: 'I think he did well.' Radamel Falcao stands in the middle of the Loftus Road pitch with his hands on his hips . The Manchester United star (left) posted a victory picture with team-mate Victor Valdes on his Instagram . United's Dutch manager added: 'It's not so important what I think, because he wants to score goals. 'And for me I have to judge how he has played. 'Scoring goals is an important aspect of a striker I know, but for me it's also very important if he is an attacking point, that he can play further and that with another striker we are coming into third and fourth phases of our attack. 'And I think he did well.' Van Gaal sent United into action in an unorthodox 3-3-2-2 formation that struggling QPR were still able to pick apart regularly in the first half. Angel Di Maria started up front alongside Falcao, but United were unable to gain tactical control. Falcao smashes a shot towards the Queens Park Rangers goal for Manchester United . Karl Henry (left) and Clint Hill (right) of QPR challenge Falcao during the first-half at Loftus Road . The travelling United fans chanted 'attack, attack, attack' and even 'four-four-two, four-four-two' in demanding a system change - and eventually the Red Devils' boss relented. A switch to a 4-4-2 diamond bore the two-goal fruit vital for victory, but Van Gaal felt it would have been risky to start with that set-up. 'I know in advance that when we play with four midfielders in a diamond that we create more chances, but then the balance of the team is also weak,' said Van Gaal. 'And you've seen it because we had created chances but so had QPR. 'We have to decide every week how we have to play. And that's the question.' QPR's goalkeeper Rob Green (left) rushes out to deny Falcao when the Colombian takes a shot at him . Green dives to his right with his hands out to prevent Falcao from scoring on Saturday at Loftus Road .

'So it's always the question, are you effective enough? 'Against Southampton away we scored two out of three chances and we won the game. 'But it was not because we were the better team at that time. 'Last week we were the better team, but in football it is not always the better team who wins. 'In the first half we played like QPR wanted.

"Eljero Elia joined Southampton on loan a few weeks ago looking for redemption and revival. So far all he has found is glory, scoring both his side’s goals here to help them move back to the giddy heights of third place — just a week after his debut ended with a first Saints win at Old Trafford for 27 years. This victory was Southampton’s third away from home in a week, following that success at United then a midweek FA Cup win at Ipswich, as they continue to defy expectations. It also meant a fourth straight match from four without a win in the temporary reign of Newcastle’s caretaker manager John Carver.

Home fans were dismayed not just by the result but that a late shout for a penalty was denied by referee Robert Madley after a shot from Emmanuel Riviere was stopped by Jose’s Fonte hand. ‘When you arms are by your side, maybe it’s not a penalty,’ said Carver. ‘When your arm is L-shaped and it hits your hand, it’s a penalty. They [Southampton] got the breaks at the right time.’ Elia is a 27-year-old Dutch winger who played, aged 23, for the Netherlands in the 2010 World Cup final but who did not continue to blossom. He is now on loan from Werder Bremen and looking to make a fresh start after periods of fitful form and off-field controversy. A speeding offence in 2013 in Germany was the most serious of his ‘bad boy’ transgressions but he was also criticised for inflammatory tweets last year when he posted ‘ready for war’ in the build-up to a Werder versus Hamburg match. He evidently feels a huge debt of gratitude to Southampton manager Ronald Koeman — to whom he dashed after scoring his first goal, tightly hugging his new boss before giving him an energetic thump on the arm. Koeman said: ‘He needs to know his coach has confidence in him. And he needs to play in his best position like today. He was fast, strong, sharp.’ Asked if he could ‘tame’ Elia and help him finally flourish, Koeman said: ‘Yes, I hope. If he keeps his concentration on football. He’s doing well, he’s showing a lot of discipline.’ Koeman said he was especially pleased with today’s win given three away games in a row — and key absentees. ‘It was a long, difficult week,’ he said. ‘Three games away but if you win you gain confidence, spirit. ‘It was great to beat United but, as a manager, the win today is better because it’s the third [away] game and we were without key players.’ Elia (left) gave Southampton the lead on 14 minutes - his first goal in English football since joining the Saints on loan this month .

Elia (left) ran straight to Southampton boss Ronald Koeman to share in the moment of his first goal for the club . Elia's new team-mates are quick to join in the celebrations of their team-mates goal at St. James' Park . Koeman was forced into three changes from the starters who began at United having lost an influential trio to injury in Morgan Schneiderlin (abductor), Victor Wanyama and Toby Alderweireld (both hamstring). They were respectively replaced by home-grown midfielder Harrison Reed, 19, midfielder Dusan Tadic returning to the starting line-up and summer signing Florin Gardos of Romania. While the deputies ultimately helped to land another fine result, this was a fourth match in charge without a win for Carver, a Newcastle-born lifelong fan of the club, who turned 50 on Friday amid continuing uncertainly about who will be permanent manager. Maybe him. Maybe not. He believes the club needs an end to the uncertainty around the post. ‘Absolutely,’ he said. ‘I hope it ends in the next two weeks.’ Newcastle soon brought themselves level on 29 minutes through Yoan Gouffran (far right) Gouffran's (right) goal came fortuitously as Florin Gardos' (centre left) clearance hits the winger before going into into the net . Gouffran (right) watches on as his crucial deflection flies towards the Southampton goal to level the scores . Southampton have progressed from uncertainty over whether a transformed post-summer team would be competitive this season to the only question being how long they can sustain a remarkable run in the top four. Central to that is whether or not they have the strength in depth to keep it going. Certainly this result was a positive sign. Newcastle had most of the possession and three chances inside the first 12 minutes. But Southampton took the lead when a long ball was cushioned down on the chest of Graziano Pelle to James Ward-Prowse, who played in Elia and he finished low across Tim Krul. The Newcastle goalkeeper could have done better but it was a quick fluid move and the hosts were caught off guard. Newcastle were back level just before the half hour via a fluke. Gardos ran in to make a clearance from a through ball, when Forster might have taken it, but succeeded only in smacking the ball into the oncoming Gouffran, off whom it rebounded into the Saints net. It was Gouffran’s first goal since December 2013. Newcastle were in the ascendancy in the second half until Koeman made a double substitution on the hour, taking off Ward-Prowse and Tadic and replacing them with Jack Cork and Shane Long. Two minutes after that, Southampton were back in front. Long headed a ball from midfield which Elia chased down, before running between Fabricio Coloccini and Daryl Janmaat — who then unwittingly deflected in Elia’s shot.

"Eljero Elia scored his first goals in English football to give Southampton a 2-1 win away at Newcastle on Saturday night. The 27-year-old gave the visitors the lead on 14 minutes with a low, blistering strike that beat Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul. The hosts drew level when Yoan Gouffran fortuitously deflected a Florin Gardos clearance into the net 15 minutes later. However, Elia had the last laugh just after the hour mark when his shot deflected off Daryl Janmaat to restore their advantage. CLICK HERE TO READ NICK HARRIS' MATCH REPORT IN FULL. Host commentator . Thanks for joining me for Sportsmail's live coverage of Southampton's 2-1 win at Newcastle. Read Nick Harris' match report HERE. They've done it! Southampton go above Manchester United and back into third place in the Premier League table. Eljero Elia's double was enough for Saints, who had been pegged back after a bizarre goal from Yoan Gouffran in the first half. Fonte handles the ball inside his own area, Newcastle players surround the referee but their pleas are ignored. I've seen those given... I'm not sure Remy Cabella will ever come good for NUFC. He's weak, slowand& hasn't got a trick (which works). And this has been one of his better games... Long is left in a heap after a challenge but there's no free-kick and a drop ball is played. Four minutes of added time to be played. The visitors are showing very little ambition - understandably so - in these last few minutes. Colback wins it back in the middle of midfield to start yet another attack. More possession and more balls into the box from Newcastle but still no breakthrough. Saints are heading everything clear and blocking every through ball. Another dangerous ball from Colback - this time from a free-kick 35 yards out - is headed out for a corner. Newcastle take it quickly but Cabella's shot is well wide. Elia will not complete his hat-trick today - the winger has gone off for youngster Matt Targett. Mike Williamson replaces Dummett with 10 minutes to go. Pelle comes within six inches of sealing three points but his header - from a brilliant Clyne cross - smashed Krul's bar before being hoofed clear. So close. The hosts are whipping more and more balls into Southampton's area as the game goes on and the latest almost gave them an equaliser. Dummett got his head to a Colback cross but somehow managed to head wide from just a few yards. He's been a nuisance for Newcastle's defence all evening and Pelle has just proved his worth at the other end of the pitch. The Italian flicked away an inswinging corner from Colback with Forster under pressure. Newcastle have turned to Sammy Ameobi to rescue something here. I watched United's reserves earlier in the week and Ameobi - who is just back from a knee injury - looked very sharp. John Carver will be hoping he and Emmanuel Riviere - still without a league goal for the club - can help salvage at least a point. Newcastle bring on Sammy Ameobi and Emmanuel Riviere for Anita and Gouffran. Daryl Janmaat had been talking to Dutch compatriot Eljero Elia just moments before he gifted the Southampton winger his second of the match. It was certainly very pally of Janmaat to allow Elia to rob him of the ball before poking past Tim Krul, another Holland international. Steven Davis gets booked for dragging back Anita. Just like his first, Elia gets a goal out of nothing. The Dutchman ran onto a flick from Shane Long, bundled his way past Janmaat and unleashed a shot which took a wicked deflection off the Newcastle man to beat Krul. 2-1 to Southampton. A superb cross from Haidara was met by Gouffran but the Frenchman could only flick his header wide of Forster's right-hand post. He'll be frustrated with that. Shane Long and Jack Cork replace Tadic and Ward-Prowse with 30 minutes left on the clock. More good work from Clyne down Southampton's right side. The England man fired in a cross after a good run but Coloccini got his head on it to clear the danger. Looks like Southampton will make their first substitution shortly, although it's not yet clear who is coming on. Koeman clearly feels his side need something different to go on and win this game. Sissoko heads the ball across to Cabella on the edge of Southampton's area but the midfielder's volley ended up well over Forster's bar. It was a tricky chance but he should've kept it down. The visitors are looking assured in possession, knocking it around their back-four and trying to play their way through Newcastle. The hosts, on the other hand, look more at home using their width on the counter-attack. Difficult to tell which way this one is going to go. A nice piece of skill from Pelle on the left almost sets Ward-Prowse away but Newcastle snuff out the danger. St James' Park crowd very quiet in the opening minutes of the second half. Yoan Gouffran's fortunate goal sees Newcastle go in level after Eljero Elia's first strike fr Southampton. All to play for after the break. Sissoko wins a corner for the hosts but it comes to nothing. Saints look happy to see the opening period out as it is. Southampton break through Elia after another weak penalty shout for a Fonte handball but Newcastle win the ball back and immediately go on the attack. Perez latches onto a precise ball over the top but he couldn't direct his first-time effort on target. Howls of anger from the St James' Park faithful as Sissoko goes down in the box after a tackle from Clyne. The England man did get a touch on the ball though. Correct decision not to award a penalty. Gouffran attempts to score his second goal of the game - and first he intended - but his 30-yard effort is miles over the bar. He'd have been better off passing, there. John Carver certainly let Dusan Tadic know exactly what he thought about the Serb's attempt to get Massadio Haidara booked. At one point I thought he was going to enter the pitch and drag Tadic to his feet. From the resulting free-kick the Southampton winger was flagged offside, much to Carver's satisfaction... Haidara goes in hard on Tadic by the touchline but manages to escape a booking. Moments later the Saints midfielder is involved with the referee himself. Bizarre equaliser for Newcastle. Florin Gardos slid in to try and clear the ball but diverted it onto the net of Yoan Gouffran and into an empty net. Huge slice of luck for Carver's men. Ward-Prowse's wicked free-kick from out on the right found the head of Jose Fonte but the big defender could only direct his header over the bar. He'll be disappointed with that after getting away from the clutches of Fabricio Coloccini. At the other end Gouffran is flagged for offside. The visitors work the ball down the right, Tadic crosses but Pelle can't get on the end of it. Southampton have really settled into the game now. I once scored a penalty past Fraser Forster during a kickabout when he was a teenager at the club's academy. He did, however, recover from that humiliation and is currently keeping his old club at bay. He really is a top keeper and, for me, should be England's No 1. Lots more possession for the Saints since Elia's goal, which was completely against the run of play. That strike seems to have given Koeman's men a shot of confidence and they're now knocking the ball about with some style. Out of nowhere Southampton take the lead through new boy Eljero Elia. A long ball was knocked down by Pelle to Ward-Prowse, who picked out the run of Elia with a perfectly-weighted pass. The Dutchman made no mistake from 12 yards but Krul will feel he should've done better. Another decent move from Newcastle ends with the ball at the feet of Ayoze Perez. The former Tenerife man got a shot away but Fraser Forster was down low to make a comfortable save. Koeman's men are closing down quickly and keeping their shape as you'd expect but they're struggling to keep hold of the ball for more than a few passes. Pelle very isolated so far. The hosts are enjoying the majority of possession in the early stages, with Cabella getting on the ball three or four times down the right already. He looks to be in the mood, just like he was at Chelsea last week. Newcastle have started reasonably brightly here. Their second chance of the game fell to right back Daryl Janmaat, whose low strike looked to be on target before it was blocked. Masadio Haidara just let the ball run under his foot for a Saints throw. Caretaker boss John Carver could be seen in the background telling his players to relax. Wise words. A typically powerful run through the middle from Moussa Sissoko ends with the ball reaching Remy Cabella out on the right. The Frenchman found Vernon Anita with his cut-back but the midfielder's shot was sliced terribly and almost went out for a throw-in before the ball was kept in. Don't under-estimate the significance of this game for John Carver. Win this and I would think he could be put in charge until the end of the season. Southampton get us underway at St James' Park. We're a little over five minutes away from kick-off at St James' Park, which means Southampton's players have almost certainly whacked on these snazzy yellow kits by now. Speaking ahead of kick-off at St James' Park, Saints boss Ronald Koeman said: 'We know they are strong, but it is tough to beat us. 'Winning games is the best medicine. We miss some good players but for others it's an opportunity. 'They need a win, the last few games they've had some defeats and they are at home.'

Starting XI: Krul, Janmaat, Coloccini, Dummett, Haidara, Sissoko, Anita, Colback, Cabella, Perez, Gouffran . Subs: Woodman, Santon, Williamson, Abeid, Ameobi, Armstrong, Riviere .

"Swansea face a major striker crisis after Bafetimbi Gomis cast uncertainty over his future and indicated that promises of playing time have been broken. The 29-year-old is unhappy about the lack of starts he was given following his arrival on a Bosman transfer from Lyon in the summer. That situation has changed in the wake of Wilfried Bony’s £25m move to Manchester City, but the striker has surprised and angered Swansea staff by speaking out on Sunday about his frustrations. Bafetimbi Gomis, up against Chelsea's John Terry on Saturday, has cast doubt over his Swansea future . The comments come just days after Gomis’s agent claimed Arsenal, Newcastle and Crystal Palace are interested in the France international. Garry Monk has previously insisted he has no doubts about Gomis’s commitment to the club, though the striker appears increasingly receptive to the idea of a quick move on from the Liberty Stadium. Gomis is quoted in France as saying: 'I have been approached by clubs. When Bony was here, it was also planned that I should play a certain number of games... that wasn't the case. ‘Today, I ask myself many questions. I need time to think. It's very difficult to accept to spend my time on the bench. ‘I don’t know what will happen. Me leaving? It is possible.’ Interest in Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis is rising after Borussia Dortmund and Schalke entered the chase . Monk now faces a huge dilemma, with his only other senior striking option being Nelson Oliveira, who is currently on loan from Benfica. The Swansea manager went to significant lengths last week in talking down previous comments from Gomis that indicated he was unsettled. But the issue has resurfaced with curious timing, considering Bony’s departure and the fact he has started Swansea’s past four games. Gomis only started two Premier League games in the first six weeks of the season following his move from France. The Swans forward  reportedly has a £8million buy out clause in his contract at the end of the season .","The 29-year-old striker has started Swansea's last four matches .

"Celtic kept the pressure on Scottish Premiership leaders Aberdeen with a comfortable 2-0 win over Hamilton at New Douglas Park. In front of a record crowd at the stadium of 6,007, Ronny Deila's side bossed the first-half with right-back Adam Matthews giving them the interval advantage in the 33rd minute with a terrific strike from 16 yards. The visitors, back from a winter break in Gran Canaria, played with an assurance for the most part and, when midfielder Liam Henderson made it 2-0 five minutes into the second half with a drive, the points were effectively safe.

Accies' 1-0 win at Celtic Park in early October had been their first victory over the Hoops in 76 years but there was little danger of lightning striking twice. In their last outing, the visitors had performed impressively on the artificial pitch at Kilmarnock in their 2-0 win and they looked equally comfortable on a similar surface at Hamilton, which had been cleared of snow. Led by skipper Scott Brown, wearing a bandage on his head to protect a cut, and with defender Jason Denayer and striker Leigh Griffiths in for Efe Ambrose and Stefan Scepovic respectively, the Parkhead side took early control. Midfielder Kris Commons, as he had done against Killie, mounted a personal attack on the opposition goal, albeit failing to really trouble Accies keeper and captain, Michael McGovern. In the 17th minute a Virgil van Dijk header from a Commons corner was easily saved by the Northern Irishman, although it seemed certain that there would be many more attempts to follow. Hamilton caretaker boss Martin Canning (left) plays on Saturday as Celtic manager Ronny Deila looks on . Hamilton player-interim coach Martin Canning, after leaving himself out for the home defeat to Dundee United on Monday night days after taking over from the departed Alex Neil, came back into the Accies' defence but they were showing little going forward. However, the home side's first corner in the 26th minute caused panic in the visiting defence. Ali Crawford's cross was cleared only to Accies' midfielder Tony Andreu, whose shot from the edge of the box was deflected up into the air with Denayer almost putting though his own goal, his wayward header saved by Craig Gordon with the Hoops keeper then blocking a close-range effort from Mickael Antoine-Curier. However, any encouragement Accies took from that close call dissipated when the visitors took the lead, Matthews running on to a pass from Commons and firing first time high past McGovern from just inside the box with his first Celtic goal since August 2013. Celtic's Commons (left) is challenged by Hamilton's Dougie Imrie during the 2-0 win for the away side . There were only five minutes gone of the second half when Celtic doubled their lead. A deep cross from Matthews from the right found Emilio Izaguirre and, when the ball fell to Henderson just inside the box, he drilled his shot low past McGovern and into the corner, with his first goal since March. Accies, sensing the game was all but gone, went for broke. Gordon was forced into a fine save down at his left-hand post by Dougie Imrie, moments before the Hamilton forward headed over the bar from six yards out. However, Celtic remained steady, repelling anything Hamilton had to offer and indeed, in the 76th minute, McGovern was forced into fine save from a vicious Griffiths' drive as the Glasgow side flexed their muscles again.

"Saido Berahino is almost certain to stay at West Bromwich Albion after the club refused to lower their £20million asking price. Liverpool and Tottenham have both made initial enquires regarding a move for the England striker. Sportsmail understands both sides are willing to fork out between £10-12m for the forward this month.

As it stands Liverpool and Spurs are unwilling to budge on their own respective valuations, meaning the 21-year-old is highly likely to stay. Manager Tony Pulis is unlikely to consider allowing Berahino leave late in the transfer window, as he would want ample time to secure a suitable replacement. Berahino's future could well become the subject of more speculation at the end of the season, but for now he is likely to stay in the Midlands.

"Lukasz Fabianski has promised Swansea City will recover from their worst home defeat in 24 years against a Chelsea side he expects to win the Barclays Premier League title. Polish goalkeeper Fabianski was a helpless spectator as leaders Chelsea underlined their title credentials with a 5-0 victory at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday - Swansea's heaviest home defeat since a 6-1 loss to Wigan Athletic in April 1991. 'We have to bounce back, there is no other way.' Fabianski said. Swansea City's players look dejected during the 5-0 loss to Chelsea - their heaviest at home in 24 years . Former Atletico Madrid forward Diego Costa fires in Chelsea's second goal of the afternoon . 'We did not give ourselves a chance. Games like that are a motivation for the next one and we have to use it. 'We all know we were very poor and that should give us motivation to prepare ourselves for the next one.' Fabianski was beaten inside the first minute by Oscar's 20-yard shot and things got quickly worse for Swansea as Chelsea were 4-0 ahead by half-time, with the Brazilian midfielder and Spanish striker Diego Costa both scoring twice before substitute Andre Schurrle added a late fifth. 'We put ourselves in a very difficult position against a great team,' said the former Arsenal goalkeeper. Swansea's Polish goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski insists they will 'bounce back' from the harrowing defeat . World Cup-winner Andre Schurrle scored the fifth and final goal of the afternoon with just 10 minutes remaining . 'After that first goal it felt like we lost the focus on the game plan and let Chelsea dominate and take advantage of the mistakes we made. 'Obviously it is difficult when every five minutes you see players coming at you at full speed and sometimes you think 'what is happening?' 'That has not been happening this season, even in the game we played away at Chelsea. 'We have been solid but right from the first minute here it was weird and strange. 'But hopefully we can come to some smart conclusions because we owe it to the fans as they were fantastic, even though we were struggling.' Swansea were severely weakened by the absence of key midfielders Leon Britton, Jonjo Shelvey and Ki Sung-yueng - a point that Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was quick to highlight after the game - on the back of top scorer Wilfried Bony's midweek departure to Manchester City. Chelsea midfielder Oscar fires in the opening goal of the game at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday afternoon . However, there was no denying Chelsea's brilliance on a day when every player was at the top of his game and Fabianski believes they are the best team in England right now. 'If I am completely honest, comparing them to Manchester City who are up there with them, I think they are stronger,' Fabianski said. 'Their attacking force is something really different, they are very sharp, quick and technical. 'They are always trying to surprise you, they make great runs and are always in good positions. 'After the last goal when they were playing around our box, I looked back and there were three players already celebrating with Schurrle and I could not believe how quickly they had got to him in our six-yard box. 'It was because they were all in there. So from a physical and technical point of view they are very, very strong.'

"Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor has rubbished claims  he kicked his mum out of his house in Africa because he thought she was a witch and has told people to 'stop doing Juju' on him. Adebayor's sister Maggie stated on Ghanaian radio station Peace FM that the Premier League striker is refusing to give his mother money and has not seen her in over a year. His mother is reportedly having to sell 'polythene bags, padlocks and other things' in order to provide for her family. VIDEO Scroll down for Stop doing Juju on me! Emmanuel Adebayor's radio interview . Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor has denied claims he kicked his mum out of his house . Premier League star Adebayor has scored two goals in 12 games for Tottenham so far this season . Juju is a word used in West Africa to refer to spells used as part of witchcraft. Juju is said to have started during the days of slavery but is still part of African tradition. However the £101,000-a-week star has refuted suggestions he has decided to abandon his own mother. Adebayor, speaking to Peace FM, said: 'I never sacked my mum from the house. She decided to leave the house. 'How am I going to be in touch with my mum if my mum is the one telling everyone that my work will not go forward, so I will just be on my side and do my thing.

"Troubled Rangers have been left in utter disarray after caretaker manager Kenny McDowall dramatically tendered his resignation after just three matches in charge of the crisis-torn Ibrox outfit. The 51-year triggered a 12 month notice period in his contract when he informed the Glasgow club he was to step down 'for personal reasons'. McDowall had been assistant to Ally McCoist but replaced the Ibrox icon in the hotseat in December after McCoist tendered his own resignation and was subsequently placed on gardening leave by the embattled Rangers board. Caretaker manager Kenny McDowell has resigned from his post at Rangers . McDowall had been assistant to Ally McCoist but replaced the Ibrox icon in the hotseat in December . In a brief statement, Rangers  said McDowall would 'remain 100 per cent committed to his normal duties' – suggesting he will carry on as Rangers manager during the period of his notice. But there remains the possibility that he could eventually follow McCoist into a period of gardening leave – if the cash-strapped club can find the money amid their current financial woes. McDowall was in charge of Rangers for just three games, starting with a 4-0 defeat at Easter Road. He also oversaw a 3-1 home win over Dumbarton and a 1-0 victory over Alloa at Indodrill Stadium. His last match was against Hearts last Friday but the contest was abandoned at 0-0 after 25 minutes due to snowfall in Glasgow. His announcement last night came with Rangers trailing 13 points behind leaders Hearts after 20 Championship games and looking destined for a place in the play-offs. Rangers players applaud the fans after the match was abandoned at the weekend . Rangers posted a brief statement on the club website. It read: 'Kenny McDowall has tendered his resignation as caretaker manager of Rangers Football Club, citing personal reasons for stepping down. 'Kenny, who has been a fantastic servant of the club, will serve his 12-month notice period, during which time he will remain 100% committed to his normal duties.

"Dundee United boss Jackie McNamara has taken a swipe at Ronny Deila after Gary Mackay-Steven signed a pre-contract with Celtic. The 24-year-old has agreed to switch to Parkhead in the summer, but the champions – who are also continuing their pursuit of Tannadice midfielder Stuart Armstrong – are set to try to strike a deal to accelerate the move. United are thought to be seeking a £250,000 fee to let Mackay-Steven go in the current transfer window. Deila admitted this week that landing the winger this month would be his preference - and that aspect of the pursuit has upset McNamara. Dundee United player Gary Mackay-Steven, 24, has signed a pre-contract at Celtic . Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara has hit out at Celtic's attempt to acquire Mackay-Steven this month . ‘I’m not comfortable with it,’ he said. ‘I like to speak about players behind the scenes and I don’t think it’s right to speak publicly about it. He (Deila) has his own way of doing things but I wouldn’t want to speak about one of his players under contract. ‘Gary is our player, he’s an important player and we have a lot of important games coming up starting with this next one against Inverness. ‘So would I go out and speak about another player under contract and say I want to take him just now? No. ‘I’ll speak to Gaz to make sure he focuses. He is our player, not anybody else’s, until the summer when his contract ends. ‘Gary has made it clear from pre-season he’s happy to stay on to the end of his contract. So, for me, there is no difference at this moment. Despite all the speculation - despite other managers saying they want to take him now - that doesn’t come into it for me.’ Celtic manager Ronny Deila admitted his preference would be to bring Mackay-Steven to Parkhead this month . Dundee United are just a point behind Celtic in the Scottish Premiership and believe they can win silverware . McNamara believes Mackay-Steven remains determined to sign off his stint at United on a high. The Tannadice side currently sit third in the Premiership and remain in both the League Cup and Scottish Cup. ‘From pre-season, he’s said he wants to win a trophy with United,’ added former Celtic captain McNamara. ‘It will possibly help him to have his future settled rather than the uncertainty of running down his contract. ‘He’s a good sensible boy and hopefully now he can just get on with playing for us for the rest of the season. The club was always prepared for him leaving for nothing in the summer because it’s worth every penny of that financial hit to keep him here until the end of the season. ‘Obviously the fans will find out he’s going and he has to accept certain things may come with that. But he’s been a great servant to us so we’re hopeful that, after he goes at the end of the season, he’ll go on and be successful in his career.’ Celtic full-back Adam Matthews will welcome Mackay-Steven to the club after admitting he’s been one of his toughest Premiership opponents. Mackay-Steven in action during Dundee United's 1-1 draw at Celtic Park last season . Mackay-Steven celebrates his second goal against Dundee at Tannadice on New Year's Day . ‘I’ve always had a difficult game when I’ve played against him,’ he said. ‘I’d put him up there with the best in Scotland. He’s got pace, a trick, good delivery and scores goals.’ The Welsh international has also been the subject of transfer debate, with Cardiff rumoured to be keen on taking him home - potentially in a trade for South Korean midfielder Kim Bo-kyung. Finally free of injury issues that have scarred the last two seasons, however, Matthews insists his commitment to Celtic has not diminished over a three-and-a-half-year stay and there is now a sense of making up for lost time. ‘Do I see my future here? Yeah, definitely,’ he said. ‘I’ve enjoyed it since I first walked in the door. I’m very happy, I love the city and the fans have been brilliant with me. ‘I’ve heard nothing from my agent about clubs interested in me, it’s just talk. I’m 100-per-cent focused on Celtic. I’ve seen the stuff about Cardiff and I think nothing of it. ‘It’s been a difficult 18 months, but I feel fit and it’s the best I’ve felt since I picked up my injury against Juventus. Now I want to get a good second half of the season.’ Celtic are also interested in signing Dundee United's Stuart Armstrong . Celtic returned from the sunshine of their training camp in Gran Canaria to the snow of Lennoxtown and face a four-point deficit to Aberdeen, albeit with two games in hand, ahead of today’s trip to Hamilton. Matthews is confident they will respond to the challenge. ‘We’ve looked switched on in training since getting home. The Dons are ahead, so the pressure is on us to win the matches we have in hand. We’re second in the table but if we win our games, we go top again.

"Rangers football board chairman Sandy Easdale has increased his stake in the club after buying up more than one million shares, the Ibrox outfit has told the stock exchange. The purchase means he now owns just over 5,250,000 shares - or just less than 6.5 per cent. The McGill's bus boss previously held proxies for just over 17million shares belonging to a number of other shareholders, including Blue Pitch Holdings and Margarita Funds Holding Trust, but the club's statement confirmed he now has voting rights for just 16million shares, worth 19.6 per cent, suggesting the shares he has bought come from within the proxy group.

He previously owned 5.21 per cent but appears to have bought up his latest tranche on Friday afternoon just as Dave King was making his big move to sweep the current board out of Ibrox. The South Africa-based businessman and the Three Bears - wealthy fans Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor - bought up around 34 per cent of the club late last month. King has now called a general meeting to oust the current board of directors which includes Easdale's brother James as well as chairman David Somers and Mike Ashley associates Derek Llambias and Barry Leach. The former oldco director - who is set to fly into Scotland early next month - and the Three Bears will need to win a majority vote if they are to rout the boardroom and are now frantically trying to build an anti-board coalition with at least 51 per cent of the club's total shareholding.

"Bath sensationally reignited their Champions Cup campaign yesterday, and in the process presented England with a timely vision of midfield magic. This demolition of one of Europe’s superpowers was a result to rank with the finest achieved by Premiership teams in Continental combat. Toulouse had lost only one of their last 17 home matches against English opposition but they were run ragged by Mike Ford’s rampant side, who claimed the bonus-point victory which gives them a strong chance of qualifying for the quarter-finals. Ross Barry (second left) gestures to his team during Bath's win over Toulouse . If Bath can beat Glasgow at home and score four tries, Toulouse would only top the pool by securing a maximum return from their trip to Montpellier. Even if Bath are edged out of top spot, they may well go through as one of the leading three runners-up. But such considerations were not of immediate concern in the away dressing room last night. Whatever it means in the bigger picture of the tournament, this was a stand-alone performance of stunning quality and magnitude. Bath won with a swagger. They won by attacking from all parts when the opportunities arose and by doing so with often breathtaking cohesion and intent. In the first half they delivered rugby from the heavens and nearly had the contest wrapped up before the break. The thrills were provided by the England trio at the heart of their back line. George Ford, Kyle Eastmond and Jonathan Joseph simply tore the Toulouse defence to shreds. The French side could not contain the mesmerising, high-octane threats in Bath’s 10, 12 and 13 shirts. Scrum-half Chris Cook (second right) is congratulated by his team after scoring in the match . Joseph stood out in particular — even before his chip ahead and slaloming run created the late bonus-point try. This was a vision of collective class which will give the England coaches much to ponder when they gather for a final selection meeting today ahead of the announcement on Wednesday of their Six Nations squad. Ford is a certainty at fly-half, but the clamour for Eastmond and Joseph to be unleashed alongside him is growing. An artistic combination awaits the call en masse. Mike Ford offered his own ecstatic assessment after this epic triumph at Stade Ernest Wallon, saying: ‘JJ was sublime, outstanding, world class — all those things. Kyle was outstanding. Anthony Watson was good. England have a lot of decisions to make, but there is no denying what the England boys did out there today.’ Asked about Joseph’s case for a return to the Test side, Bath’s director of rugby added: ‘He’s very close. It depends on the way Stuart Lancaster wants to play, but JJ has really stepped it up. I know the England coaches are meeting tomorrow, so they’re going to have a good re-think.’ Francois Louw signs autographs for supporters before the start of the game . If Lancaster and his assistants want to exploit the potential of their wide runners, then the evidence of the first half-hour here should convince them that Eastmond and Joseph must be in the mix. They inspired Bath’s onslaught which caused disbelief in the stadium. An early George Ford penalty was followed by a slick first try for the visitors in the seventh minute. Leroy Houston’s forceful drive generated impetus, then Chris Cook’s deft off-load released Francois Louw and the Springbok flanker sent giant wing Matt Banahan galloping over. Ford converted to give his side a double-digit lead but Toulouse’s power was always likely to be a factor and, sure enough, they hit back with a try from a lineout drive, but it proved to be a brief reprieve. In the 24th minute, as the hosts were building menacingly in the Bath 22, Jean-Marc Doussain’s pass was intercepted by Cook, who sprinted 80 metres to score. Moments later, Ford’s men struck again in fine style. Eastmond stormed clear from his own half, picked out Banahan with a well-timed pass and the wing in turn off-loaded for Joseph to touch down. Louw  (right) closes down Toby Flood (centre) as he is in possession . The conversion made it 22-7 and soon after, Bath almost killed the contest. Horacio Agulla set off a raid from deep, Ford and Joseph kept up the momentum but Watson failed to take the chance. When Yoann Huget, who later disgraced himself with a theatrical dive, went over at the other end, it looked as if Bath might pay for squandering that opening. But they didn’t, thanks to a display of defiant spirit to go with all their eye-catching flair. George Ford’s try-saving tackle on the rampaging Yannick Nyanga was a turning point, as were the scrum penalties the visitors won — the last of which brought one last penalty at the end. There was also a double-team tackle on Luke McAlister by Matt Garvey and Carl Fearns which typified the resistance. Joseph created Bath’s fourth try out of nothing nine minutes from time. From near halfway, he sent a deft little kick behind the defensive line, darted through to re-gather and swerved left around two flailing opponents. Ross Batty charged on towards the line and he in turn sent Louw swallow-diving over. It was a magnificent try to cap a magnificent performance which suggests that Bath are on course to return to Europe’s top table after a long absence.","Bath had a 25 point lead over Toulouse by the end of the first half .

"Dave King has insisted he would have no problem convincing the authorities that he is ‘fit and proper’ to become an Ibrox director as he described the current Rangers board as ‘one of the worst the club has ever had’. The crisis-torn club announced plans on Monday to fight King’s bid to oust chairman David Somers, chief executive Derek Llambias, finance director Barry Leach and director James Easdale at an egm to be held within the next six weeks. King needs to win 51 per cent of the vote if he is to succeed in replacing the unpopular current directors with himself, fellow ex-Rangers director Paul Murray and John Gilligan, the former managing director of Glasgow brewer Tennent’s. Dave King (above) says he'll have no problems convincing the Rangers board he's fit enough to run the club . Rangers Chairman David Somers (left) with Derek Llambias (right) But, in a clear reference to King paying £44million in South Africa after pleading guilty to contravening tax laws, the board told the stock exchange on Monday: ‘The rules require that all individuals appointed to the board of an AIM company are suitable to be a director of a UK public company.’ In addition to the AIM market, King and Murray will also have to convince the SFA they are ‘fit and proper’ people to be directors after previously being on the board at Ibrox prior to Craig Whyte leading the club into administration and then liquidation. Yet King said: ‘There are no problems regarding the AIM regulations and the issue with the SFA is simple. Only once a director is appointed is an application made to the SFA by the club. ‘Both myself and Paul will have to deal with our previous directorship at the time that Craig Whyte got involved. Additionally, I will have to deal with my reasons for staying on the board and trying to impose some level of governance during the Whyte era. ‘I will also deal with my favourable settlement in South Africa. ‘These are all issues that the SFA rightly has to address in the same way that the SFA has to review the history of anyone who gets involved with a Scottish football team. Mike Ashley (left) appointed his associate Derek Llambias (right) as Rangers Chief Executive in December . Off-field politics have prompted numerous protests from Rangers fans this season . ‘That was all considered by me prior to my application - as was the likelihood that the incumbent board will use the media to try and influence the debate by misrepresentation. ‘The enthusiasm that this board adopts to ‘media management’ and its failure to act in the interest of shareholders and other stakeholders is exactly why they should be jettisoned in favour of directors who have the requisite business skills and respect for the tradition of Rangers to take the club forward. ‘History will judge this board as one of the worst the club has ever had. There is not one individual who puts the club above personal interest.’ King’s salvo came after Rangers called on him to drop his call for a General Meeting on Monday morning and to save the financially-stricken club the expense of hosting it. The board’s 7am statement added: ‘If the notice (issued by King) is valid and is not withdrawn, the directors intend to recommend that shareholders vote against the proposed resolutions.’ In a second statement, the under-fire Rangers directors conceded they may have to consider using Ibrox as security on a loan - but insisted any decision would not be ‘taken lightly’. Shareholders arrive at Ibrox Stadium in Glasgow, ahead of the 2014 Rangers AGM. Fans protested against that possibility before Friday night’s abandoned clash with Hearts after it was revealed Newcastle United owner and Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley - who owns an 8.92-per-cent stake in Rangers - had applied for security over both the stadium and Murray Park as part of a £10million loan arrangement. The so-called Three Bears - wealthy fans Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor - had already announced they would increase their own loan offer of £5m but would not ask for security on the stadium. The board added: ‘The directors are pursuing bilateral discussions with two parties who are both stakeholders in Rangers. ‘These discussions contemplate a significant amount of capital being available to the business on a long-term basis in order to enhance the squad which the directors believe is necessary. ‘A consequence of funding to this level is that, in reality, it may be necessary to use Ibrox stadium as security; such a decision would not be taken lightly. ‘No decision has been taken at the current time while discussions are being finalised in good faith. ‘The advance notice does not mean that security will be given, and the directors are adamant that it will not unfairly advantage the party with whom it was agreed. ‘The board will conclude a transaction, based on its merits, which it believes is in the best interests of shareholders as a whole in accordance with their fiduciary duty.’","Rangers lie second in the Scottish Championship - 13 points behind the leaders Hearts .

"Sheffield United midfielder Jose Baxter believes life in the Barclays Premier is too nice.

'The Premier League is an unbelievable league, probably the best in the world but then teams aren't used to getting barged about, people in the faces, kicking them and not helping them up when they get kicked. It works for us. 'There's a lot of matey matey stuff in the Premier League. 'I've got a couple of mates in football but I don't like it at all - hugging and kissing each other before games and all that. 'My best mate, James Wallace, is in the same team as me now but if I was playing against him, I wouldn't speak to him until the game's finished.

Last season they beat Aston Villa and Fulham in the FA Cup before losing 5-3 to Hull at Wembley in the last four. Baxter added: 'Once you beat the big teams your confidence grows.

'We've obviously got respect for them, but we'll go out there to boss them about and to things to them that Premier League teams don't do and it's worked. 'Our run increases our belief that we can beat anyone in the cups and we showed that last season too. 'Look at Southampton, they've beaten everyone in the league and are high-flying in the Premier League, so for them to come here and for us to beat them, shows we can really beat anyone.'","Sheffield United face Tottenham in the Capital One Cup quarter final first leg on Wednesday night .

"Sheffield United captain Michael Doyle accepts his side must lift their game to an even higher level if they are to pull off another upset in their two-legged Capital One Cup semi-final against Tottenham.

""They'll look at our previous results and performances in other cup games and I'm sure they'll take note of that. ""They won't underestimate us, especially as we've come so far and they'll be looking to finish it in the first leg, so we've got to be on our guard. ""I just hope we can keep the tie alive.

""We've gone out with no fear in them and produced some of our best performances in a long time. ""The cup games have left people scratching their heads and asking why we can't replicate that form in the league. Players celebrate after Doyle scores the winning penalty in a penalty shoot out against West Ham United . ""In the league games we probably have the ball as much but we sit back and counter-attack in the cup games a bit more, whereas teams probably do that to us in the league. ""It's quite difficult to play against if you do it right. We've found it difficult to play against at times, but we do it quite well ourselves, which we've shown against the Premier League teams. ""We're at the serious end of the cup now and probably nobody else will give us a chance, but our fans have seen the performances we've put in and they'll be expecting us to go down there and have a go.""

"So for the first time, Jermain Defoe failed to score on his debut for a new club, and was spared that modern dilemma of whether or not to celebrate scoring against an old one. He had hoped to notch Premier League goal No 124 just over a year after his last, against Crystal Palace last January, but will continue his quest against Burnley at the Stadium of Light on January 31. That might be an easier task than breaching an improving Tottenham back line while starved of service, which was his task at White Hart Lane. After debut goals for West Ham, Bournemouth, Tottenham, Portsmouth and Toronto, a sixth was never on the cards. Jermain Defoe returned to White Hart Lane after completing his move from Toronto FC to Sunderland . The former Tottenham striker makes his way out the tunnel ahead of Sunderland's clash with his old club . Defoe shakes hands with former team-mate Danny Rose (both centre) as the teams line up before the game . The former England forward did not manage a shot at goal, even though he could claim to have made Sunderland's goal, being fouled for the free kick from which Sebastian Larsson equalised. But he had no chances worthy of the name to improve on a not-particularly-impressive recent record of three goals in 34 Premier League games. That said, he had prospered against less fearsome opposition over the same period, scoring twice for England against San Marino, seven times in the Europa League against such mighty opponents as FC Sheriff and Tromso, and twice against a weakened Aston Villa side in the Capital One Cup. Then there were 11 goals in 16 appearances for Toronto against MLS teams. The trouble is that Burnley and the other Premier League teams that he will face over the remainder of the season are better than almost all of the above. What is in his favour is that he will be match-fit and have a better understanding with his new team-mates. 'I think he started bright, he was sharp,' Sunderland manager Gus Poyet said. 'I'm sure when he gets that opportunity he will put the ball in the back of the net.' The 32-year-old forward has a moment with his old Tottenham strike partner Roberto Soldado . Defoe jumped straight into the Sunderland starting line up after his transfer from the Major Soccer League . Although he was in familiar surroundings, starting a game at White Hart Lane was something of a novelty for Defoe. Eleven of his 14 Premier League appearances for Tottenham last season were from the bench. He was cheered by both sets of supporters when his name was read out in the Sunderland team. But in a sense it was as if he had never been away. His photograph still hangs in the press lounge, and he was part of a video montage of past Tottenham greats shown on the big screens before the teams came out. He started the match playing alongside Steven Fletcher, and his first touch came after three minutes with Sunderland already a goal down to Jan Vertonghen's deflected shot – although it was hardly a glorious entrance into the match as he fell unconvincingly over Vertonghen's challenge, with referee Chris Foy utterly uninterested in appeals for a penalty, to Poyet's dismay. 'If the referee gives a penalty, if he saw what everyone else in the ground saw, we would be talking about a great debut [for Defoe],' Poyet said. The former Tottenham star tests out his pace against speedy Spurs right-back Kyle Walker (left) Defoe is shown no love as he is sent crashing to the floor by his former colleague Jan Vertonghen (left) Instead it was proving hard for Defoe, who was already short of match fitness, having not played since October, to adapt to new team-mates and a new system. He strayed offside because a ball was not played through to him quickly enough, he made a run down the side of the defence in anticipation of a pass from Fletcher that was delivered outside the defender rather than inside, so that Defoe found himself trying to deliver a cross from a difficult angle rather than a shot on goal from a more favourable position. The Paxton Road end, aware of the danger he will always pose, roared to alert Eric Dier to the danger as he dawdled on the ball with Defoe picking up speed behind him. Perhaps it was that fear of what Defoe might do rather than the need to make a tackle that made Vertonghen lunge out at him after the ball had gone on the half hour, conceding a free kick and earning a yellow card. Further punishment was swift as Seb Larsson curled the ball over the wall for Sunderland's equaliser. It was not the dream debut the Black Cats newcomer had hoped for as he failed to get on the score sheet . Having contributed to his team levelling the score, Defoe then did his bit in defence, holding off Kyle Walker following a corner and this time persuading Foy that he had been fouled. And two minutes before half-time, we thought the moment had arrived as Fletcher found Defoe with a short pass inside the Tottenham penalty area. But a scrum of defenders instantly surrounded him and he had to pivot back to try to make a yard of space and ran out of room. After a period of Spurs dominance at the beginning of the second half, Sunderland prepared a substitution and we wondered whether Defoe would be summoned, but instead Poyet gave him a new partner, replacing Fletcher with Connor Wickham. However, it was to no avail and when the board went up a second time and Danny Graham moved towards the touchline, time was up for Defoe. Time, though, will be the judge of the success of his latest move.","Jermain Defoe started for Sunderland against former club Tottenham .

"Jermain Defoe featured in the pre-match montage at White Hart Lane and Harry Kane T-shirts were being sold on stalls outside but it was an 88th minute strike by Christian Eriksen, the late goal specialist, that sealed victory for Spurs. Sunderland’s new signing Defoe was given a warm reception when his name was read out in Gus Poyet’s starting line-up. He is close to being a club legend at Spurs, having scored 143 goals during two spells there, and had been training with the club’s development squad until the paperwork for his move to Wearside was completed late on Friday.

Eriksen, meanwhile, scored his eighth goal of the season, five of which have come in the last six minutes of the game. Spurs head coach Mauricio Pochettino, who is said to demand so much from his players in training that they require ‘two hearts’ said Eriksen’s superior fitness was telling. Crediting his assistant Jesus Perez, Pochettino said: ‘It’s a lot down to him. We score a lot of late goals and I think that’s because our fitness is very good. Our mentality is that we always believe we can win, you have to be strong in your mind, but you also have to feel good physically then you can push on.’ Eriksen struck two minutes from time with his third goal in as many games against Sunderland after he collected an Andros Townsend ball on the edge of the box before striking low and powerfully past Costel Pantilimon. Sebastian Larsson had earlier cancelled out Jan Vertonghen’s third-minute opener. ‘It’s always a bit of a heartbreaker when the winning goal comes so late,’ said Poyet. ‘It hurts but it is part of football and you need to be good all the time, not just until the 88th minute.

Poyet disagreed with referee Chris Foy’s decision to wave away Defoe’s penalty appeal after he went over in the box following a challenge by Vertonghen. ‘If he gets the penalty and scores then we are talking about a great debut, but unfortunately the referee did not see what everyone else saw,’ Poyet said. All the focus before the match was on prolific goal scorer Defoe but it was Vertonghen, who had not scored in the Premier League since March 2013, who put the home side ahead. Eriksen’s free-kick was parried by Pantilimon and bobbled towards Vertonghen on the edge of the area. The Belgian’s shot deflected off Santiago Vergini and into the net. Defoe’s most notable contribution was enticing a foul by Vertonghen, earning a free-kick from 20 yards out. Larsson expertly curled the ball into the top corner to even up proceedings on 31 minutes. It was the Swede’s 11th Premier League goal direct from a free-kick and he is in good company — only Thierry Henry, Gianfranco Zola and David Beckham have scored more. Defoe was not the only man making a comeback. Emmanuel Adebayor was brought on to replace Roberto Soldado, who again failed to capitalise on his chances, after 61 minutes. The Togo striker was making his first appearance for Spurs since a defeat at Stoke on November 9 and was jeered by some fans. He has not played at White Hart Lane since complaining that booing from supporters was damaging. After the final whistle he disappeared down the tunnel while his team-mates celebrated on the pitch. Hugo Lloris endeared himself to fans once more with vital saves of creditable Adam Johnson and Danny Graham efforts. In a last-ditch attempt to equalise, Sunderland’s 6ft 6in keeper Pantilimon rushed to join the visitors’ attack in the dying seconds. Spurs broke on the counter and Vertonghen thought he had given them a third goal, shooting into an open net, but a referee’s assistant raised his flag for offside. ‘I think the referee and linesman were a little bit confused on the rule,’ said Pochettino. ‘It was definitely a goal, he was inside his own half, but maybe they were not focusing on the game.’ Not that the Argentine seemed too upset.

"Chelsea skipper John Terry is chasing success on all fronts this season - insisting the current crop of Stamford Bridge stars need to win silverware to be considered greats. Jose Mourinho takes his Blues to Anfield on Tuesday night for the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final clash having witnessed a fine performance and 5-0 win at Swansea on Saturday. That result, coupled with reigning champions Manchester City losing to Arsenal, leaves Chelsea five points clear at the top of the Barclays Premier League table.

And Terry wants the club to fight for every title available as the class of 2014/15 looks to add their names to the Chelsea history books. 'We've got top, top players but, as I've said before, until we go and win things, it's not there yet,' the former England captain said. 'That will be the test. We've shown during the first half of the season that we're capable of pushing the top sides and that's what we aim to do. 'There is a motivation in the dressing room to win the league and push on in the Capital One Cup, Champions League and FA Cup.

The 34-year-old is hoping for a similar evening when he leads the side out at Liverpool on Tuesday but expects a stern test. 'In the first half at Swansea, the football and the goals were some of the best I've seen. Myself and Gaz (Gary Cahill) felt like we weren't doing much apart from applauding what we were seeing in front of us, it was a delight to watch and I really hope we continue that. 'It (Anfield) is going to be a tough place to go. I think Daniel Sturridge might be back, (Raheem) Sterling is back as well and they proved when we went up there in the league that it's always a tough game. 'You kind of forget form and where they are, it goes out of the window, it's Chelsea v Liverpool. It's going to be tough and over the two legs I just hope we're strong enough.' Goals from Cahill and Diego Costa cancelled out Emre Can's opener as Chelsea left Anfield with all three points on November 8, but Liverpool have only lost twice since then and Brendan Rodgers' side will be hopeful of extending that run at Terry's expense.

"Arsene Wenger says Arsenal will be active in the January transfer window after injuries to Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Debuchy. Wenger confirmed the pair will be out for three months each after Arteta had an ankle operation and Debuchy had surgery on his dislocated shoulder. That leaves Arsenal short of options at the back, forcing Wenger - who has been linked with moves for West Ham's Winston Reid and Celtic's Virgil van Dijk - into the market.

Wenger said: 'Yes, we are more [in the market now]. We have (Calum) Chambers and we have (Hector) Bellerin, who is coming on well, and I want to give them a chance as well, but of course we are in the market like many other clubs. 'We work really hard, morning until late night, to try to get one or two players in.' He added: 'We are out in the market and we are working very hard everyday. All our scouts and our people are working very hard to find a defender.' Asked whether he was interested in Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, Wenger replied: 'He’s not a defender. At the moment we are more looking for the defensive department.' Debuchy's injury has especially come as a big blow to Arsenal, with the defender only recently returning from a previous injury. The 29-year-old fell into the advertising hoardings after a push by Stoke's Marko Arnautovic in the 3-0 win last week. Wenger said: 'He is destroyed because he is such a keen player, so professional, so willing. 'It is his first year here and of course he is embarrassed. But it is not his fault. He was pushed.

"Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck has reassured fans that the club do not plan to use artificial crowd noise to improve the matchday atmosphere at Stamford Bridge. In November, Jose Mourinho opened the debate on the Chelsea noise levels when he claimed that playing at home was 'like playing in an empty stadium'.

Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck has reassured fans that fake crowd noise will not be used at Stamford Bridge . Jose Mourinho said in November that playing at home was 'like playing in an empty stadium' 'Our manager, for some reason, decided a few months ago to say that the fans were quiet at moments,' Buck said to the crowd at an event in London hosted by the Wall Street Journal. 'One of the problems is it's very difficult to get tickets when the stadium is sold out every week. It's difficult to get young people to visit because it's hard to buy tickets. 'Every club is looking to improve the matchday experience, but we can't have recorded fan noise — our fans just wouldn't accept that.

'Everyone knows how much I feel connected to this club and the fans. At this moment it's difficult for us to play at home, though, because playing here is like playing in an empty stadium. 'The team then starts playing like it's a quiet, soft game at home. It's difficult to get that strong start where the players, team and fans at Stamford Bridge (are all together). 'I was today looking around and it was empty, but not in terms of people because it was obviously full.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has faith his players can compete against Chelsea on the pitch irrespective of what gameplan Jose Mourinho employs. In their last two visits to Anfield the Stamford Bridge boss has comfortably won the tactical battle and Rodgers has lost all three encounters against his former mentor since taking over on Merseyside. However, he insists that will not have an effect ahead of Tuesday's Capital One Cup semi-final first leg at home against the current Premier League leaders. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers says he has faith in his squad to beat Chelsea in their League Cup semi-final . 'I think a big part is down to the players. Once they cross the line it is about them and the confidence and the qualities they have,' said the Reds boss. 'He is a top-class manager, Jose Mourinho has proven that over the last decade or so. 'He has great experience but once the players cross the line for me I have a big trust in the group and they are working well at the moment. 'For us it is certainly not a threat, it is an opportunity to reach a final.' Despite almost winning the league last season Rodgers, in his third campaign in charge, knows he will have to start delivering silverware soon as the club's last trophy came in this competitions under Kenny Dalglish in 2012. Liverpool could welcome back captain Steven Gerrard (centre) for Tuesday's semi-final against Chelsea . It would represent a significant hurdle overcome for the manager but he sees it as even more important for his young squad. He was a youth team manager at Chelsea during Mourinho's first spell in charge and Rodgers believes winning the League Cup, the Portuguese's first trophy in England, provided a platform for a decade of success. 'Our objective is to win a trophy and qualify for the Champions League,' said the Reds boss. 'I think winning a trophy would help our future here in what we are trying to build and trying to deliver. 'It will give the younger players a lot of experience. Gerrard (right) came off at half-time due to injury in  the Reds' 1-0  win at Sunderland on January 10 . 'I joined Chelsea in 2004 and at that point in their history they were a club who wanted to win titles and trophies. 'They have maybe done it in a different way but over the last 10 years they have shown once you have won that first one you can hopefully go on and sustain it. 'The players back then, some of whom are still there now, will tell you the first one is the most important. 'We know it is going to be a challenge but we know if you want to win the competition you have to beat the best teams and at this moment in time Chelsea are the best in the country.' Usually it has been Chelsea who have played things tight and capitalised on the counter-attack but ironically, Rodgers may find he has to rein in his side's attacking intent in order to ensure they are not taken apart as easily as they were for Mourinho's last two visits. Liverpool last won the League Cup in 2012, under former boss and Anfield hero Kenny Dalglish (centre) In a two-legged semi-final the last things he wants is for his side to have to go to Stamford Bridge next week and chase the game from the off. 'It is a different type of game, you don't want to open up too much, but the tie is not won or lost in that first game so it is important we retain our confidence,' he said. 'You will have to deal with pressure at moments in the game but the most important thing coming out of this game is to make sure you are in a good position going into the second leg. 'The last six games they've won two, drawn two and lost two so we will look at it as an opportunity at home.

"Roberto Martinez has held talks with referees’ chief Mike Riley to outline his anger at recent decisions that he feels have cost Everton dearly. Everton’s manager is not someone who will criticise referees after matches but he has felt the need to speak with Riley, the Head of the PGMO, twice in recent weeks, following a Barclays Premier League game against Manchester City and the FA Cup replay against West Ham United. Martinez believes Andre Marriner made a number of errors at the Etihad Stadium on December 6, when Everton lost 1-0, while he was furious with an incident at Upton Park six days ago when Neil Swarbrick never gave Kevin Mirallas what appeared to be a clear penalty. Everton manager Roberto Martinez reacts after a decision goes against his side . He insists talks with Riley have been amicable but Martinez has vented his frustrations, insisting mistakes – such as Craig Pawson’s failure to send off Newcastle’s Papiss Cisse for a clear elbow on Seamus Coleman – are happening too often. Martinez said: ‘I have contacted Mike Riley about it. The two big decisions were against Manchester City really where there is no justification for those big calls – the red card for Mangala on Samuel Eto'o (that wasn’t given), the yellow card against Ross Barkley and the penalty (that wasn’t). ‘The (Mirallas penalty incident) at West Ham is even harder to take because it is the linesman who gives the free-kick and then the referee knows exactly where the action happened. We contacted Mike, but there's not much you can do on that. The Spaniard, on the touchline, has discussed recent contentious calls with referees' chief Mike Riley . ‘They accept there's been an honest error made, but there have been too many now. Referees are part of the game and the error of the referee makes the game what it is. 'It's tough to take when you've got six or seven big calls which didn't go your way and scorelines could have changed.’ Everton have only won one of their last 12 games. They should have too much quality to get dragged into a fight at the bottom of the table and Martinez wants them to make home form count, starting tonight against West Brom. ‘The next nine games we have at Goodison we cannot lose any points,’ said Martinez. ‘That is the aim. We are going to approach every home game like that. We know how difficult West Brom are. Tony Pulis is going to bring his own stamp on it but they have a very experienced group of players. ‘It will be a difficult game, but all the games we will face at Goodison we just feel we need to find a way to be the favourites and perform in a manner which will get us three points.’ Pulis, meanwhile, insists he has no problem selecting Saido Berahino against Everton despite his conviction for drink driving. Berahino, 21, was disqualified from driving for a year and given a £3,400 fine after admitting the charge on Friday and faces internal discipline too. But Pulis will keep faith in his star striker, who has scored six goals in his last three games and 14 for the season, despite insisting West Brom are not solely dependent on his scoring ability. West Brom striker Saido Berahino has been linked with the likes of Liverpool and Tottenham this window . ‘He will be in the squad,’ said Pulis. ‘I will have a chat with him if I feel it is necessary and if it’s not necessary I will leave it. He has been a good kid since I walked in through the door. He has been fine. He has to make sure he maintains that. ‘We have got other players who can score goals, other players who, if we don’t play Saido, will step in and put a shift in. ‘It certainly isn’t a one-man team in respect of how young and inexperienced Saido is.’ West Brom manager Tony Pulis will be desperate to keep hold of star striker Saido Berahino .","Roberto Martinez left furious after recent decisions against his side .

"Manchester United are hopeful that Robin van Persie’s ankle injury will only keep him out for one game, which is good news for Louis van Gaal but not for Radamel Falcao. Van Persie limped out of United’s defeat at home to Southampton on Sunday and was forced to cancel plans to travel to Zurich for the Ballon d’Or awards ceremony where he had been nominated for Goal of the Year. However, tests have revealed no serious damage and Van Persie is only expected to be ruled out of this weekend’s game at QPR. Robin van Persie (left) hobbled out of Manchester United's defeat at home to Southampton on Sunday . Ander Herrera replaces van Persie during the second half of the defeat to Southampton at Old Trafford . The 31-year-old should be available for the trip to Cambridge United in the FA Cup a week on Friday, although he was rested for United’s game at Yeovil in the last round when Van Gaal gave James Wilson an opportunity to impress. The news on Van Persie is less positive for Falcao who is desperate for a run in the team to persuade United to make his loan move from Monaco permanent in the summer. The Colombia star was surprisingly axed from the 18-man squad for the Southampton match by Van Gaal, casting further doubt over United’s intentions to go ahead with a £52million deal. Radamel Falcao is given a tough welcome to England by Stoke City defender Marc Wilson at Old Trafford . Falcao has struggled to make an impact for Manchester United this season and would cost up to  £52 million . Falcao is expected to regain his place against QPR in Van Persie’s absence on Saturday, but his return to the starting line-up may be shortlived. His agent Jorge Mendes admitted earlier this week that he was unsure if the former FC Porto and Atletico Madrid striker would stay at Old Trafford beyond this season after starting only eight games so far. ‘I don’t know (if he will stay),’ said Mendes. ‘He is a fantastic player and I think it’s very difficult for Manchester United fans. They have an absolutely brilliant player, one of the very best in the world, who would without any doubt play 90 minutes, every time, with any other club. ‘The truth is, now, we don’t know what will happen. What we do know is that he will play for one of the very best clubs in the world next season, whether that is Manchester United or not. I am 100 per cent sure of that. But you know how football works, we’ll see what happens.’ Falcao and Van Gaal walk side-by-side following his arrival on-loan from Ligue One side Monaco in the summer . Van Gaal dropped Colombian striker Falcao from the squad for the defeat against Southampton on Sunday . One striker certain to be leaving United is Angelo Henriquez after the club agreed a transfer fee in the region of £1m with Dinamo Zagreb. Henriquez cost £4m when he moved to Old Trafford in the summer of 2012 from Universidad de Chile but never played a competitive game for United, scoring once in a pre-season friendly against Swedish club AIK a year later. He went out on loan to Wigan and Real Zaragoza before making a season-long move to Zagreb where he has scored 10 goals so far this season. Dinamo Zagreb coach Zoran Mamic (left) confirms that a deal for Angelo Henriquez  (right) has been agreed . The deal included an option for the Croatian side to sign Henriquez permanently in the summer, and coach Zoran Mamic confirmed that terms have now been agreed. With so many star names in Van Gaal’s squad, Henriquez had already indicated that his future would probably lie away from Old Trafford. ‘We have bought him outright,’ said Mamic. ‘Taking Henriquez depends on us, not on Manchester United. We took him with the right of first refusal, which stands at around €1.5m, and we have already signed a contract with him for the summer. There is no longer any doubt – he is ours and the story is resolved.’ Meanwhile, FC Midtjylland of Denmark have failed with a bid for United’s Danish keeper Anders Lindegaard. Lindegaard is for sale after Victor Valdes signed, but the clubs cannot agree a fee and the keeper would prefer to join a bigger team.

"Tottenham have been accused of misleading supporters in their ongoing dispute about building a new stadium. Archway Sheet Metal Works Ltd are standing in the way of Spurs acquiring all the land needed to start work on a new 56,000-plus capacity stadium next to White Hart Lane. After seven years of negotiations failed to reach a conclusion, the club secured a compulsory purchase order last July forcing Archway to sell. But the company challenged the decision and it was due to be heard in the High Court on January 15. Archway Sheet Metal Works Ltd are preventing Tottenham getting the land they need to build a new stadium . An artist's representation of the interior of Tottenham's state-of-the-art new stadium, which will hold 56,000 . Tottenham's vision for their new stadium which they hope to have completed by 2018 . That date was adjourned until February 17 and Tottenham released a statement last week explaining: ‘Due to the fact that not all parties were ready to proceed, the court has adjourned the hearing for a short time and this will now be heard on the 17th and 18th February 2015.’ But directors of Archway, owned by Josef Family, have hit back and accused Tottenham of being the cause of the delay. An Archway spokesman said: ‘In view of the club’s incomplete and misleading account of the true reasons for the adjournment, we made a friendly request for a slight amendment to the news item on the their website. This was to ensure that the fans were not misled into believing that we were responsible for the delay, but Spurs refused to make that amendment. ‘Archway makes this clear statement so that Spurs fans, the news media and other interested parties are not misled as to who is responsible for this ongoing delay: clearly, Haringey Council and the secretive directors of Spurs.’ Archway insist that Tottenham did not provide information ordered by the High Court by the deadline of January 7.

Vertonghen's goal goes in as Tottenham go 1-0 up against Sunderland in the weekend Premier League clash . Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris could not keep a clean sheet against Sunderland at White Hart Lane . Christian Eriksen scored Tottenham's late winner against Sunderland . Archway also claim the compulsory purchase order is ‘unlawful and unfair’ because Spurs and Haringey Council did make information public about their plans before it was granted.The spokesman added: ‘This information relates to secret discussions between the club and various public bodies concerning major changes to the club’s scheme on which the case for compulsory purchase of our land was based.’ Tottenham were hoping they would be able to move into their new stadium by the start of the 2017-18 season, but believe the delay in construction due to Archway has made that highly unlikely. Archway, located on Paxton Road right next to White Hart Lane, went up in flames last November, prompting an investigation from the London Fire Brigade into the cause. The company claim they have been subject to threats and abusive calls from Tottenham fans after standing firm in their stance to block the club’s plans. Spurs are keen that their plans to start construction work and move into their new home are not delayed any further. The club insist that they were not suggesting anyone in particular was not ready to proceed with the High Court hearing and that the statement they released is correct.

"Roberto Martinez insists he will do “what is best for the club” when it comes to making a decision on Samuel Eto’o’s future. The Cameroon striker has been the subject of interest from a number of teams, notably Sampdoria. He has made 12 starts for Everton in all competitions so far and if he makes another three, he will automatically trigger a clause in contract that secures another year at Goodison Park. Eto’o made a bright start for Everton after joining them as a free agent in August but his impact has dwindled in recent weeks, raising the prospect that he will leave before the end of the transfer window. Martinez, however, is in no hurry to make a firm conclusion. Former Cameroon international Samuel Eto'o has been linked with a January move away from Goodison Park . Roberto Martinez insists he will only give the Eto'o deal the thumbs up if it is the right thing for Everton . ‘We have had a couple of enquiries, but nothing concrete,’ said Martinez. ‘With Samuel, We are going to take a couple of weeks to decide what the next step will be. I don’t rule anything out at the moment. ‘It may be that Samuel stays with us. We are going to decide what is best for the club and for Sam.’ The main issue for Martinez in the transfer window is whether he will bring in goalkeeping cover. Tim Howard is still injured and not expected to be fit until the middle of February, leaving the untried Russell Griffiths as understudy to Joel Robles. ‘We are still in the same position as we were before,’ he said. ‘We need a little bit of extra cover. We have got three terrific young keepers at the club but we just need that experience. We are going to look for a very specific profile. Martinez, meanwhile, is ready to talk with England Under-21 head coach Gareth Southgate about his plans for Ross Barkley this summer and whether he will take him to the Czech Republic for the European Championships. Gareth Southgate (left) could name Ross Barkley in his European Championship squad, Martinez isn't sure . Southgate has raised the prospect that Barkley, who only has one Under 21 cap, could be part of his squad but Martinez is not sure whether that will be the right move for the 21-year-old, whose form has been the subject of some concern recently. ‘It depends on the type of role,’ said Martinez. It is impossible to give a straight answer but we have a good relationship with the FA and Gareth Southgate. Ross has been involved in the best possible tournament, which is the World Cup. I don’t think other tournaments could be as positive. ‘Those experiences with the Under 21s are to progress you to the senior level. Once you get to senior level, you are then blocking someone’s path. Ross has had terrific experiences but we will always be happy to assess it. We will speak about it, I am sure.’ Barkley (left)  is one of the Premier League's hottest prospects and could feature for the U21s in the summer . Everton have not won a game since December 15 and will look to rectify that on Monday night against West Brom. Martinez is wary of the threat they pose under new management. ‘I always admire what Tony Pulis has achieved,’ he said. ‘He always found a way of making his team competitive with the players that he had. Stoke evolved in the Premier League and at Palace he found a way of using the wide men. His experience will be valuable for the second half of the season. ‘We are still involved in two competitions. February is going to be really challenging but we welcome that and we are looking forward to the busy periods that we have. We are looking into opportunities to go for a warm weather training camp. It gives you good opportunities.’ Tony Pulis will be hoping to continue Everton's woeful run of form when they meet on Monday evening .

"Amid the latest furore over Manchester City’s spending, it is worth noting that Alexis Sanchez could have been walking out at the Etihad in blue on Sunday had the Premier League champions not been operating under tighter financial restrictions last summer. When it became clear that Sanchez was leaving Barcelona, City manager Manuel Pellegrini considered entering the bidding for his Chilean compatriot. It soon became clear, however, that the £30million fee agreed between Barcelona and Arsenal was too much for the reduced transfer budget imposed on City by UEFA. Alexis Sanchez scores a superb volley for Arsenal against Man City in September's 2-2 draw at the Emirates . Manchester City were keen to sign the Chile international from Barcelona before his summer move to Arsenal . Sanchez celebrates in front of the Arsenal faithful with Nacho Monreal having given the Gunners a 2-1 lead . The player also preferred a move to London, and the Premier League champions were unaware at that stage of the summer that one of their four strikers, Alvaro Negredo, would soon be returning to Spain for personal reasons. Reflecting on the issue, Pellegrini said: ‘It wasn’t easy. He was a very expensive player in that moment. Barcelona sold him to Arsenal but I am sure Alexis can play everywhere.’ It was not the first time City had courted Sanchez. Sanchez, pictured celebrating after scoring in Arsenal's win over Stoke, preferred a move to London . City were unaware  Alvaro Negredo, who joined Valencia this summer, would return to Spain . In the summer of 2011, he was even higher on Roberto Mancini’s list of transfer targets than Sergio Aguero when Udinese decided to cash in on their prize asset. Contact was made between City and the player’s camp but Sanchez had set his heart on joining Barcelona. ‘When they stopped picking up the phone or returning calls, we knew we’d lost him,’ said a club source. Realising that Juventus were circling around Aguero, City moved quickly to avoid missing out on their other leading target and agreed a £38m fee with Atletico Madrid to sign the Argentine. Aguero is ‘100 per cent fit’ after a knee injury, according to Pellegrini, and the shootout between him and Sanchez will be the highlight of Sunday’s clash between City and Arsenal at the Etihad — a fixture that produced a thrilling 6-3 win for the home team last season. City were keen to sign Sanchez from Udinese in 2011 but the player had his heart set on Barcelona . Comparisons between them have dominated the build-up to the game, but the City boss was reluctant to indulge in such an exercise. ‘I don’t want to compare him with Sergio,’ added Pellegrini. ‘I think Alexis is a very good player, he is having a very good season in England. ‘It is not easy for a player in his first season here to score so many goals. ‘Alexis is repeating what he did in the last two seasons at Barcelona and scoring a lot. I am very happy for him because he is a very enthusiastic young player and improving. ‘It is not the first year from Alexis here in Europe. He had eight or nine years when he was very young in Italy with Udinese and then returned on loan to South America. He played really well in Barcelona and now in England. The football fans in Chile are very happy for him and for the country.’ Sanchez races away from Stoke defender Geoff Cameron 12 goals in the Premier League in his debut season . Comparisons between Sanchez and Man City striker Sergio Aguero have dominated the build-up to the game . Man City boss Manuel Pellegrini says Sanchez is performing very well in the Premier League this season . Sanchez hits a free-kick against Stoke to score Arsenal's third goal of the game and complete the victory . Samir Nasri will miss Sunday's clash with Arsenal . On the expectations for the clash with Arsenal, he added: ‘It is difficult to score six and three goals again, but I think for fans it will be a very attractive game. ‘I hope we can score the same amount of goals, and Arsenal have more problems to score three.’ City will be without one of their key players after it emerged that Samir Nasri will miss the game against his old club with a calf injury that is expected to keep him out of action for up to a month. The French midfielder is set to miss four Premier League games and the FA Cup fourth round tie against Middlesbrough, but should be back to face Barcelona in the Champions League first knockout round on February 24. There was more troubling news for Pellegrini when Yaya Toure once again cast doubt over his future at the club in an interview at the Africa Cup of Nations. Toure and his agent caused a bizarre issue last summer by hitting out at City for failing to acknowledge the midfielder’s 31st birthday with a cake and, allegedly, grant him compassionate leave to see his dying brother Ibrahim. Speaking to CNN World Sport at the Ivory Coast camp in Equatorial Guinea, where he is on international duty with City’s new £25m signing Wilfried Bony, Toure reflected on ‘a horrible year’ and once again refused to commit his future to the club. Asked if he will be at the Etihad next season, he replied: ‘I don’t know. I’m at City at the moment. ‘That’s a big question and that’s an easy question as well, and you have an easy answer — we’ll see.’ Yaya Toure has claimed that he doesn't know if he'll be a Manchester City player next season . Toure’s £250,000-a-week deal at City runs until 2017 and Pellegrini was quick to dismiss concerns that he will be going anywhere soon despite comparisons with his latest comments and the birthday cake fiasco. ‘You can’t link one thing with the other,’ said the City boss. ‘I repeat, Yaya is very happy here. His commitment with our club is not a problem. We have to play two more games without Yaya and he will arrive here in February. ‘He’s a very important player for us, but I don’t think our team depends just on one player.’","Manchester City host Arsenal at the Etihad stadium on Sunday .

"Frank Lampard has insisted he remains fully committed to New York City and said he only ever joined Manchester City as a way of staying fit ahead of the Major League Soccer season. Manchester City have faced a storm of criticism for their handling of Lampard's situation since it was confirmed on New Year's Eve that the 36-year-old will remain with the Barclays Premier League champions until the end of the season, delaying his debut for sister club New York until midway through their inaugural MLS campaign. There has been much confusion over Lampard's contractual situation, with differing accounts as to when he signed for which club and for how long. Frank Lampard at a press conference in New York as he was introduced by the MLS outfit . Lampard holds up a New York City FC scarf after 'joining' the MLS club . But Lampard, in an interview with The Times, insists his commitment to New York remains priority. Describing the talks he had with Ferran Soriano, chief executive of both City and New York, after leaving Chelsea, Lampard said: 'It was 100 per cent New York. I had sat down with Ferran and it was all about New York. 'There was no mention of Man City. If they had wanted to speak to me on behalf of Man City, with New York in the pipeline beyond that, they could have done that, because I was a free agent, but that was never the question at all.' Lampard said City did not enter the equation until he began to consider ways to keep fit during the long wait for New York's season to start, and insisted there was no question over his commitment to New York going forward. 'I have signed for New York,' he said. 'The original intention was for that to start on January 1. I signed a Man City agreement in the interim (in August). Now that has obviously changed. I have extended my period here and will join New York later. Lampard insists he is fully committed to his new career in the MLS despite the Manchester City loan . 'That is what has frustrated me, that people were sort of saying ""You knew what you were doing"",' Lampard added. 'I never would have done that. If I had wanted to come to Man City, then I would stand up and come to Man City. That wouldn't have been a problem. 'And in terms of Man City being ""sneaky"", they could have signed me on a free anyway if that's what they wanted to do. People mention Financial Fair Play but what difference would that have made? 'No difference. It would have been a slippery move, a dodgy move, for nothing. The fact is I signed for New York, then I signed for Man City in the interim and now it has been extended.' City manager Manuel Pellegrini sought to draw a line under the affair on Friday, saying: 'I think it's an issue which is finished. 'Frank now is here. I know that there a lot of different opinions about Frank, about that. I respect all of them, but the decision is taken already and Frank will stay here until the end of the season.'

"Frank Lampard faces being jeered by some sections of the New York City FC fanbase when he finally arrives at the MLS club. Supporters had bought season-tickets and shirts on the back of Lampard’s summer unveiling and news that he will not be joining them until July – and that he never signed a playing contract in the first place – has not been well received. Chance Michaels - president of The Third Rail supporters group – told Sportsmail: ‘The whole situation is very frustrating. Manchester City have admitted that they have misled fans and New York City over Frank Lampard . City had wrongly claimed that Lampard signed for New York City last summer before agreeing a loan move . ‘If we’d known all of the details from the start then we would not be as upset as we have been this past week. All of this could have been easily avoided. ‘But we have a problem with transparency in the MLS in general and I feel for Lampard being caught in the middle of it.’ Third Rail co-founder Anthony Buckley added: ‘It comes down to how they presented it – he was wearing the shirt and we were told he was definitely going to play. ‘Then we were told he was staying at Manchester City and now that he had never signed at all. ‘We’re confident he’ll still come here to play but some fans have already taken back shirts with his name on and say they’re going to boo him. Lampard smiles during his press conference after it was announced he would be joining the MLS club . The former Chelsea man pictured in action during City's Premier League clash with Sunderland . ‘Personally, I won’t be doing that because I'm putting my heart 100 per cent behind this new team, but the reaction has been very mixed towards him and this situation.’ Michaels, meanwhile, understands why some fans feel aggrieved. ‘Clarity is the big issue here and some fans feel they’ve been lied to – be that by the league, the club or the player, so I understand why some people want to show their feelings when he does play,’ he said. ‘But the fact there was no contract does not bother me and I think Lampard’s statement was very clear and seemed pro New York City FC. ‘We just hope all of this is sorted and he does come to play here in July.’ I want to make it completely clear about my situation as I have read a lot of lies and nonsense over the last few days. When released from Chelsea last year at the end of my contract I signed a commitment to play in NYC FC for two years starting January 1 2015. I was then offered the chance to train and be part of the Man City squad in the interim to keep myself in the best shape going into New York. This period has since been extended by Man City and I now will start playing for NYC FC at the end of this current Premier League season. There has always been a constant dialogue between all parties in this time to find the best solution for everyone. I can say that I am very excited about arriving in New York and giving everything to the team to make us a success in the MLS as soon as possible. Thanks everyone for your ongoing support and I wish everyone a healthy and happy 2015!","New York City FC fans were told they had signed Frank Lampard .

"Manchester City raised eyebrows when they paid £28million for Swansea's Ivorian front man Wilfried Bony. While the 26-year-old's quality is not in doubt, his transfer fee is high considering he is unlikely to be available until February, and even then will probably be fourth choice. But Manchester City fan Colin Ashmore of www.90min.com believes Bony could be just the player to help the club retain their Premier League crown. Wilfried Bony, 26, joined Manchester City on a four-and-a-half-year deal, he will wear the No 14 shirt . Bony poses with the No 14 Manchester City shirt after completing his £25m switch to the Etihad Stadium . They say that £28m is a lot of money for a fourth-choice striker, but I think Wilfried Bony deserves a bit more credit than that. No player scored more goals than him during the last calendar year and the Ivory Coast forward is not some flash-in-the-pan striker; he’s managed to find the net wherever he’s been and his goalscoring record proves that. You can argue there’s a fair bit of wilderness between the Czech league and Europe’s elite competition, where the striker is heading if Manuel Pellegrini can successfully mastermind a win over Barcelona in the Champions League – but either way Bony scores goals because he’s smart. Whether he make the step up to Champions League football so quickly and how City overcome Barcelona remains to be seen, but on paper City fans should have no reason to doubt his quality. Bony is quick, strong and powerful. Yet, somewhat unfairly, his best qualities are often overlooked. His first touch is exceptional - I suppose it has to be when leading the line for someone of Swansea’s ilk - whether it’s with his head, chest or his preferred route; into feet, contrary to popular belief. Wilfried Bony (posing with Ivory coast president Sidy Diallo) has completed his move to Manchester City . His movement is also first-class; perhaps the reason he scores as many as he does and why Gylfi Sigurdsson has more league assists this season than he managed in two years at Tottenham. And keep an eye on his finishing; while the power is there if he needs it, he’s equally capable of selling a goalkeeper with his eyes and tucking one neatly inside his far corner. As far as I’m concerned, he’s an ox with a strong grasp of ballet. Already though, there are doubts over the Ivorian’s future at the Etihad Stadium, both long and short-term.For starters, due to international commitments, we are unlikely to see him until mid-February at the earliest - even his unveiling took place under the beaming West African sun! Let’s assume the The Elephants reach the final of this year’s African Cup of Nations, then perhaps we could pencil in a potential debut in the FA Cup fifth round - somewhere around Valentine’s Day. That’s also envisaging the Blues beat Middlesbrough in a week and a bit’s time. Bony (pictured here at the World Cup) is currently away at the African Cup of Nations with the Ivory Coast . The striker leaves Swansea for £25million and will earn £100,000-a-week in wages . You’d hope that Sergio Aguero will be banging them in again by then, with Edin Dzeko back too in all likelihood. Bony will already be playing catch-up. But even if we don’t see too much of him before the season’s out, there’s no need to panic. Dzeko himself was a January addition and scored only two goals from eight league starts in his first-half season. The Bosnian scored 14 the year after, 14 after that and 16 last term - all from a maximum of 23 starts (2013/14) - and I’ve no doubts that Bony will deliver too, whether it’s now or a year or so down the line. Consider that City paid around £23m for Stevan Jovetic - a second striker whose highest ever league goals tally is 14 - then £28m for Bony doesn’t seem quite so steep. The Ivorian needn't worry about his future at the club. Jovetic, on the other hand, I’m not so sure about. In my eyes it could prove to be a very shrewd signing by Pellegrini, especially with the games coming think and fast between now and the end of the season. Bony could well prove the difference in the title race.

"Ronald Koeman is not wasting time and energy fretting about Southampton's mounting injury problems, although his frustration with the fixture scheduling is clear. Saints are in their best-ever position at this stage of a Premier League season, with the impressive win at Manchester United meaning they enter the weekend sat third. Wednesday's win at Ipswich also means they remain in the FA Cup, although these victories have come at a cost as Toby Alderweireld, Morgan Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama have all been injured over the past week. Ronald Koeman is frustrated with the fixture schedule despite his side's impressive performances . Wanyama's setback has been particularly frustrating for Koeman, with the Kenya midfielder facing a month out with a hamstring injury sustained during the third-round replay at Portman Road - a match the Dutchman sees no need for. 'I don't put too much energy in that problem [of injuries] because you can't do anything about that,' Koeman said. 'You can always look to what you are doing in the training sessions and how we recover the players, but we haven't trained in the last few weeks because we played so much. 'It's a problem with the schedule that the players have during what normally has to be a winter break. 'We have to play. Another replay? Come on, please, play the FA Cup with extra time and penalties. Why a replay? Another game - it's crazy.' Koeman saw Southampton beat Manchester United at Old Trafford to go up to third in the Premier League . The injuries brought on by that schedule compound the pre-existing problems Jay Rodriguez and Sam Gallagher have, as well as the absence of Maya Yoshida, Sadio Mane and Emmanuel Mayuka due to international commitments. Koeman is confident Saints can 'handle this' number of missing key players, although concedes that will change if that list grows further. The Dutchman can at least call upon Eljero Elia against Newcastle this weekend, having been ineligible to face Ipswich, and Jack Cork could come in, having returned from an injury lay-off with 45 minutes for the under-21s on Monday. Victor Wanyama suffered a hamstring injury against Ipswich and is set for a month on the sidelines . Shane Long will have also given Koeman food for thought with his display against Ipswich, against whom his strike was enough to secure progress in the cup. 'Shane showed his quality and his confidence,' the Saints boss said. 'It's not a question about his confidence, it's that in the last few games he didn't start in the team. 'We need everybody and we need Shane, and if Shane gets the opportunity he has to show his qualities like he did.' If Long is to feature, he may have to again play out wide with Graziano Pelle likely to lead the line at Newcastle in Saturday's late kick-off. Alan Pardew's exit and murmurings of discontent at St James' Park would seem to make this a decent time to face the managerless Magpies, but Koeman will not be taking them for granted. 'I don't think it is a good time or a bad time [to face them],' Koeman said. 'Every game is different. 'They play at home, they have had some defeats in the last few weeks and, for sure, they will have some fans feeling [bad] about the 4-0 that they got in Southampton. 'But we know they are a strong team at home. They beat Chelsea at home, but it is not easy to beat Southampton.'","Ronald Koeman's Southampton sit in third place in the Premier League .

"Manchester City now boast four of the Barclays Premier League’s top five goalscorers of 2014 after completing the signing of Wilfried Bony from Swansea for £25million. The champions finally sealed the capture of the Ivory Coast striker on a four-and-a-half-year deal for a fee that will rise to £28m, depending on his success at the Etihad Stadium. Bony will not join up with his new team-mates until next month because he is due to play for Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations but his arrival gives Manuel Pellegrini’s squad a very dangerous look as they try to chase down league leaders Chelsea in the second half of the season. Wilfried Bony has joined Manchester City on a four-and-a-half-year deal. He will wear the No 14 shirt . The 26-year-old puts pen-to-paper on his deal with Premier League champions Manchester City . Bony will join Manchester City talisman Sergio Aguero (right) in the attack at the Etihad Stadium . Edin Dzeko (loeft) and Yaya Toure (right) also made the top five list of Premier League scorers last year . Wilfried Bony (posing with Ivory coast president Sidy Diallo) has completed his move to Manchester City . Bony himself was the Premier League top scorer for the last calendar year with 20 goals. He was followed by new team-mates Sergio Aguero and Yaya Toure — with 18 and 17 respectively. Manchester United’s Wayne Rooney was next on 16 before City’s Edin Dzeko with 14. Pellegrini has signed Bony, 26, for two reasons. Firstly, because of ongoing injury issues with Aguero, but also because there is a chance City’s current third-choice striker Stevan Jovetic may be sold to an Italian club before the end of the transfer window. ‘It’s a great feeling for me, it’s a big honour to be here and it’s a great challenge,’ said Bony last night. ‘As a player it’s always good to be part of one of the biggest clubs in the world and it’s a good opportunity for me to be in that situation now — I’m really proud. ‘I felt excited to wait for this moment and now it’s come, it’s fantastic. I think it’s a great decision for me — Manchester City are in the Champions League. Bony believes his fellow Ivorian and new Manchester City team-mate Yaya Toure (top) will help him improve .

Bony scored past Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart in November as Swansea lost 2-1 at the Etihad . If Bony's fee rises to £28million he will be the most expensive African player ever, ahead of Emmanuel Adebayor (£25million) ‘You remember at the end of last season I said that if I want to move it will be to a team in the competition because it’s a great tournament that I really want to play in and one that I want to win. ‘It’s a motivation for me to give my maximum to be in that place. City are a big club with great players.’ Bony added that he believes playing alongside compatriot Toure will make him a better player. ‘I speak with Yaya every day on international duty and I think he will help me to become a better player and a more clinical striker,’ he said. Bony scored more Premier League goals in 2014 than any other player as he hit the net 20 times . Swansea striker Bony turned up in a rather unique outfit for an interview with Sportsmail last year . Mmanchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini expects Bony to settle into the side quickly . ‘I’ll be playing with great players here at City and this is an opportunity for me to work hard and to take my chance. ‘The Premier League is a tough league — my power is to always be in the box and in the right position.I’m always working hard to be there to score the goals and to improve.’ Pellegrini added: ‘Bony is very difficult to mark because he is so strong. He is an intelligent footballer who has skill and power. His goals record has been excellent since he came to England. 'He adapted very quickly to the game here and he will settle in at City quickly. He will be a very good addition to our squad. We now have four top-class strikers.’","Wilfried Bony agreed a four-and-a-half-year deal worth £100,000 a week .

"He is the boy from a quaint fishing town in Ireland, but Seamus Coleman could soon find himself as one of the most expensive defenders in British history. As Louis van Gaal holds talks over the purchase of signings at Manchester United on Friday afternoon, the name of the Everton defender will be raised. He is one of the most enthralling Premier League players to watch, blending his modern day professionalism with spirit of eras gone by perfectly. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roberto Martinez on Seamus Coleman rumours . Seamus Coleman (second left) has had a remarkable rise to the top and could soon be heading to Old Trafford . Coleman was even pictured in a Manchester United shirt when he was younger (left) before moving to Everton . Coleman is someone who would improve almost every team in the top flight, and has his perseverance to thank for that. He is a different kind of footballer, grateful for what he has but still holds ambition to play at the very top. His slick and stylish panache on and off the ball is all that Everton want in a player, but he is very much different off the pitch. There are aspects of Coleman’s life that are markedly different to the majority of his peers. Firstly, he is exceptionally modest, humble and treats the business for what it is: a job, and one which requires serious devotion. The Irishman turns up to Finch Farm each day, works hard and then goes home. There are no airs and graces to him; just a man born in a fishing town in County Donegal. He has a long-term girlfriend, leads a settled life and is dedicated to his family. Coleman (left) grew up in County Donegal in Ireland, beginning his sporting life playing Gaelic Football . He impressed for Sligo Rovers, pictured (left) in March 2008, enough to warrant a £60,000 move to Everton . It was at Sligo Rovers (right) that he impressed Everton scouts enough for them to bring him to England . Those, coupled with his fearless nature at right-back, is what appeals to Roberto Martinez and why he is now one of the first names on the Everton sheet each week. The Spaniard saw something in Coleman right from the off. On taking the job at Goodison Park at the beginning of last season, Martinez knew there was something to work with here. Coleman had played the majority of the previous year and impressed by all accounts – his willingness to run up and down the right-hand touchline for 90 minutes an obvious appeal to the new boss. But, interestingly, Coleman wasn’t doing enough for Martinez. The criticism was that he’d stop when he hit the final third – almost passing on the burden of responsibility to those in front of him. It could be construed as having been a cop-out, but Martinez felt his man just needed a push, pulling him to one side at half-time of the very first game of 2013-14, telling the defender he needed to start continuing his runs into the penalty area. So he did, and at breakneck speed. Coleman is a buccaneering full-back not seen enough in the modern game. He is a player to excite the ground, get them up off their seats. That, in essence, is all Everton supporters want. He left Sligo Rovers, where he is pictured (right) in May 2008 against Drogheda United, at the age of 21 . In 2009, when he joined Everton, Coleman had been playing for Republic of Ireland's U21 side for two years . He was given a chance at first-team action in 2010 when he was loaned to Blackpool in the Championship . And it is what the Blackpool fans of 2010 saw plenty of when Coleman’s career really kicked off during a loan spell on the Fylde Coast which ended in promotion to the Premier League. In April of that season, during an away win at Scunthorpe United, Coleman picked up the ball 35 yards out. He looked ahead and charged towards the home penalty area, weaving his way through United defenders and using attackers as decoys. The move finished in the youngster flicking in to the net and the whole of Glanford Park rose as one to applaud a goal which ought to have adorned a stage far grander. He had come from nowhere. Everton signed him for £60,000 from Sligo Rovers a the year previous but there were no opportunities to impress in the first team. The goal that made everyone turn and look at Coleman came while on loan at Blackpool, against Scunthorpe . Coleman has now broken through to the Republic of Ireland senior team, pictured at Wembley in May 2013 . Coleman is known for his buccaneering runs from full-back, and is a mainstay in Everton's first team . Blackpool, and winning the Championship play-off final at Wembley, provided a springboard. He’s taken it gleefully. The only blot is Coleman’s age. Even though he is seen as someone still coming through, he is now 26. That is largely down to an injury picked up on a pre-season tour of Seattle prior to his loan in the Championship. The blister on his toe became infected – a small procedure becoming far larger and setting him back months. Now he’s making up for lost time, and it’d be no surprise if Van Gaal opens that sizeable chequebook and pays what the Toffees demand for a man who epitomises the right balance of professionalism and flair. Coleman heads home for the Toffees against Wolfsburg in the Europa League at Goodison Park .

"Shaun Wright-Phillips has been offered the chance to resurrect his career out on loan in the Championship – but has refused to leave QPR, according to manager Harry Redknapp. Wright-Phillips, who is estimated to earn £65,000 per week, has played just 78 minutes of football this season during the Capital One Cup defeat away at Burton Albion and has been told by Redknapp he can leave Loftus Road. The midfielder claims he went to Redknapp and asked what he needed to do to get a chance in the team and how he could improve, but says the discussion turned heated and they ended up rowing. Shaun Wright-Phillips hasn't featured for QPR since the defeat by Burton in August . Wright-Phillips said he went to speak to manager Harry Redknapp about his absence from the team . Blackburn, Bolton and Charlton are all understood to have been interested in signing the 33-year-old – only for the midfielder to turn down the chance to leave QPR. Redknapp said: ‘We've offered Shaun the chance to go out on loan, but he's not wanted to go. I think he needs to move on and play - I've told him that many times. ‘You have opinions on your players, some you want and some you don’t that is the way the football world goes round. ‘We had clubs come in who have wanted to loan him and he has not wanted to go out on loan. So he is still here. ‘He trains hard. But he's not going to move when he's on a fantastic contract. ‘It is not the boy's fault. If someone wants to give you a lot less money you're not going to move are you? Blackburn, Bolton, maybe Charlton, they've come in for him and he didn't want to know. He doesn't want to go on loan.’ Responding to Redknapp's claim that Wright-Phillips would not leave the club on loan, the 33-year-old insisted he still had something to offer his manager in the second half of the season. 'I'm not at QPR to go back and forth. I'm fit and ready to do my bit in this relegation fight as they may need me at some point. I believe in myself and know what I'm capable of,' Wright-Phillips wrote on social networking site Kicca. Ian Wright, Shaun's adoptive father, hit back at Redknapp's claims that his son was motivated by money. 'Ridiculous statement about not wanting to go on loan!!! You get paid the same money when you're on loan,' the former Arsenal striker tweeted. Redknapp said Wright-Phillips (left) did not want to leave QPR because of his 'fantastic' contract . Redknapp admits the midfielder (left) trains hard and doesn't blame him for staying at the club . Former Chelsea and Manchester City wide-man Wright-Phillips revealed he tried to talk to Redknapp about the situation to find out how he could improve his chances of reclaiming a place in the first team. 'I just want to play football. I don't want any QPR fans to feel I am short-changing them,' Wright-Phillips said in an interview with the Sun on Friday. 'I went to see Harry but it didn't go as I was hoping. I don't know if he thought I was going in for an argument but it certainly wasn't that and it got a bit heated. 'I just wanted to know what I could do better, how I could improve, just advice really. I didn't expect to be sworn at.' Redknapp also fought off speculation that defeat by Manchester United on Saturday could cost him his job. QPR are 19th in the Premier League and without an away win all season, but Redknapp says he wants to carry on fighting to keep the club in the top flight. The 67-year-old boss claims to have a great relationship with the club's hierarchy . He added: ‘I have a great relationship with the chairman and shareholders. It is their decision, if they decide they want to go in a different direction then that is up to them. ‘They have given me great support and I have loved every minute of my time here and I want to stay. ‘But it is their decision, I can’t lose any sleep over it. I spoke to Tony (Fernandes) this week and he has not suggested anything like that. And until he does I’ll keep doing what I do. ‘I will keep trying to win football matches. We have been playing well at home and if we had beaten Swansea here when we were 1-0 up two minutes into injury time then we would be sitting higher up the table. That’s how close it is. We are all stuck down there, one win can take you up five places and a defeat can drop you down four or five places as it did with us. We just have to keep going.’ Redknapp is not worried about his QPR job ahead of the visit of Manchester United on Saturday .","Shaun Wright-Phillips has only played 78 minutes of football this season .

"If Fernando Torres does nothing else of note during his Atletico Madrid swansong – this will be more than enough.

The build-up to this game had been all about Real Madrid and the comeback they needed in order to turn around the 2-0 first leg last week. Supporters lined the streets to welcome the home team coach and then held gold cards above their head to greet Cristiano Ronaldo as he showed off the Ballon d'Or he won on Monday. The man himself was wearing new boots encrusted with micro-diamonds to mark the event. None of this impressed Atletico who took the lead after just 49 seconds. Antoine Greizmann raced away down the left past Pepe. He crossed intelligently to Torres who coolly slooted his first time effort into the far corner past Real keeper Keylor Navas. In one glorious moment so many years of frustration had evaporated. Coach Diego Simeone has transformed everything about Atletico Madrid but getting Torres to score against the old enemy ranks with his best achievements. The world's best player Cristiano Ronaldo shows off his Ballon D'or trophy to supporters before the game . Toni Kroos, Ronaldo, Sergio Ramos and James Rodriguez show off their awards before the Copa del Rey tie . Ronaldo was given a rapturous reception on his first appearance at the Bernabeu since being named world player of the year . Simeone was off the bench after the goal calling for calm from his players as Real had the best of the next 10 minutes. But aside from a Gareth Bale header from a Dani Carvjal cross that was easily gathered by Jan Oblak there was little real danger until the 18th minute when Toni Kroos sent over a corner that Karim Benzema knocked down to Ronaldo who was bravely denied by Oblak. It looked like it was going to be the Slovenian keeper's night but he then he slipped as Ramos rose to connect with a Kroos' free-kick and Real Madrid were level. The free-kick that led to the goal had come from Torres kicking Ronaldo. Since his goal Atletico Madrid's centre-forward had spent most of his time in his own half trying to help stem the white tide. That tide kept coming and when the ball ran to Ronaldo just inside the penalty area it looked like the perfect moment for the Ballon d'Or winner to get his first goal of the night but first Tiago and then Mario Suarez threw themselves in front of the shot with the latter blocking it. Juanfran did likewise to deny Ronaldo from Bale's cross, and on it went – red and white striped shirts flinging themselves in front of white ones. Raul Garcia took the Alamo act too far and was booked for kicking Isco. With Atletico defending so deeply, there was no way through for Real Madrid and Bale's attempts at getting round the back of them were falling short because he was being forced to cross on his weaker right foot. In the second half he was switched to the left to greater effect, but only after lightning struck twice with Torres' second goal.

He did it brilliantly getting away from Pepe and finishing past Navas. The former Liverpool and Chelsea forward had silenced the Bernabeu again. They found their voices once more when Bale crossed from his new position wide left and Ronaldo glanced a header past Oblak but Real were still left needing two goals. Torres was taken off before the hour and the Bernabeu whistled as one – the crescendo of jeers looked to be music to Torres' ears as he grinned and took his time leaving the pitch. High in the gods at the Bernabeu around 500 Atletico Madrid fans sang his name, even they could not have written the fairytale played out by their returning favourite son. Afterwards Simeone was asked what the 30-year-old Torres who had scored twice against Real Madrid had, that the young Torres didn't. He said: 'I ask myself the same thing sometimes. He was very young when he was first here. Too young for many of the things that happened to him. The welcome home he got from all the supporters was fantastic and I am pleased for all those supporters that he has made such a good start.' Sportsmail columnist and former Liverpool defender wrote on Kicca: . Fernando Torres got a brace for his childhood team against his & their biggest rivals Real Madrid, it took me back to our defeat of Real Madrid in 2009 when Torres struggled in the first leg as he did last week. In the second leg at Anfield he was electric and destroyed them with pace, power & a goal then a celebration in front of the Madrid fans that told us his feeling towards them! That pace and power may have diminished but the two goals tonight will have felt exactly the same!

"Derek Fisher is one of the most decorated players the NBA has seen over the last two decades, but this year he has learned that coaching is a whole different ball game. After winning five NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers, Fisher called time on his illustrious playing career and is now in his rookie year as New York Knicks head coach. But the 2014-15 season has been a reality check for coach Fisher, and his Knicks side travel to England with just five wins from a miserable first half of the campaign. ‘Our record is not where we would like it to be for sure, but we are in the process of restructuring and retooling the New York Knicks.’ Fisher said at the team’s practice facility in Tarrytown last week. Derek Fisher is going through a tough time with the New York Knicks in his first season as head coach . ‘We are going to play a new brand of basketball and we are going to represent this city and organisation in a different way. The wins and losses don’t represent it right now, but we are making progress, we are changing out habits, we are building a new culture and we believe we are going to get there.’ Fisher’s calm persona, optimism and belief that his team will eventually get it right cannot hide the fact that this is a completely different Knicks side to the one that travelled to London two years ago. On that occasion, a New York team featuring Carmelo Anthony at his peak as well as the likes of Tyson Chandler, JR Smith and Jason Kidd proved far too strong for the Detroit Pistons in a 102-87 victory. The Knicks finished second behind the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference standings that year, and fell in the East semi-finals to the Indiana Pacers. Fisher brings his Knicks team to England on the back of a 15-game losing streak and with a 5-35 record . This year, though, they travel to London on a 15-game losing streak and with the unwanted tag of being the worst Knicks team in history. ‘It has been challenging,’ Fisher said. ‘We have asked these players to play a new style of basketball and to approach their job in a different way. When you’re asking somebody to try something new and they’re not getting positive feedback it is difficult to keep going. ‘It has tested our faith and our trust in each other, but we are forging relationships as men. Nobody likes to lose, but these guys are working hard everyday and there are still a lot of positive things going on even in the face of our struggles right now. ‘We have really had to make sure our guys remain diligent in their habits and focus on the process as opposed to the results. If you focus on the process and the habits then the results will start to take care of themselves. ‘The losses just represent the fact that we are not at where we need to be yet, but it doesn’t mean that we are going to give up on what we are trying to do.' The Knicks have only won one of their last 26 games and all but given up on their season . Injuries haven’t helped the Knicks, but a trade last week that sent Smith and Iman Shumpert to the Cleveland Cavaliers for very little in return was effectively a surrender of their season. In making the trade the Knicks have at least cleared some cap space for free agency in the summer, but their fans can expect many more losses this season. Fisher, though, is not giving up on his future goals with New York and believes that they will start winning games by playing his brand of basketball. ‘While I was playing, I always believed the game should be played a certain way,' he said. 'As a young kid, the way I was coached and taught to play basketball, it was as a team with all five guys contributing on the floor and guys on the bench supporting their team-mates. ‘You dribbled the basketball with a purpose and passed with a purpose. No matter what system I decided to run, it was going to be with that in mind that basketball truly is a team game and that’s how I want my teams to play on both ends of the floor. Fisher is optimistic that the Knicks will be a force again once he implements his brand of basketball . ‘I feel that my experience and my belief in the way that basketball should be played over the course of my lifetime is going to bode well for me and help me going forward. ‘We have a wonderful coaching staff with a world of championship experience and Phil Jackson as the president of our team is a great resource. It gives me a lot of confidence that I have plenty of support and resources as to how to continue to find ways to try and push the right buttons for our team.’ A trip across the Atlantic away from the spotlight may be just what the Knicks need right now, but on Thursday they will come up against a Milwaukee Bucks team that has beaten them twice already this season. ‘Sometimes a road trip for a team is a good thing,’ Fisher said. ‘On the road, it is just you and your team and so there is a different level of brotherhood and togetherness that starts to happen. Fisher won five NBA titles as a player with the Los Angeles Lakers during his long career . ‘Hopefully while we are in the UK we can take advantage of the fact that we are a band of brothers going over to represent New York and represent the league and have a good time while we work hard. ‘We understand the responsibilities that come with representing the NBA overall and not only is it a regular-season game that means something on our schedule, but it is also an opportunity to grow the game and give people in the UK a special experience. ‘It is a gift to be able to go there and so we want to represent our team and organisation well. We also have to respect the fact that that UK is rolling out the red carpet for us to come in and so we should spend a certain amount of time in the community and make sure we are touching people and enjoying our time while we are there.’ The Milwaukee Bucks take on the New York Knicks at NBA Global Games London 2015 at The O2 on January 15.

The 37-year-old carded nine birdies at the Waialae Country Club in Honolulu as he made the early running along with American Webb Simpson. The only blemish on the three-time European Ryder Cup player's card was a bogey five on the sixth hole, which was his 15th. Englishman Paul Casey almost equalled the course record after the opening round at the Sony Open . Simpson also played the back nine first, but was only one under at the turn. He hit form with a run of seven birdies in his last nine to join Casey on a score that was just one short of the competitive course record.

"The European Tour has received a massive shot in the arm with the news that leading American Patrick Reed has taken out membership — and he is unlikely to prove the only one. Rickie Fowler, who makes his Middle East debut alongside Rory McIlroy in the first round of the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship on Thursday morning, revealed he is giving serious consideration to becoming a member as well. Reed opened the PGA Tour season with a win in Hawaii on Monday to become only the fifth player in the past quarter-century to win four times in America before the age of 25. The others were McIlroy, Sergio Garcia, Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson. Patrick Reed, posing with his trophy, opened the PGA Tour season with a win in Hawaii on Monday . It is an enormous coup, then, for him to take out tour membership on this side of the Atlantic as well. ‘Exciting times,’ the 24-year-old tweeted, alongside a photograph of his membership badge. The last high-profile American to take out European Tour membership was former Masters Champion Zach Johnson in 2009, and before him other one-time major winners such as Open champions Ben Curtis and Todd Hamilton, and USPGA champions Shaun Micheel and Rich Beem. But Reed’s is arguably a far more exciting development, for not only are all his prime years in front of him, it could also act as a catalyst. McIlroy, pictured during the Abu Dhabi pro-am, has finished as runner-up three times in the tournament . McIlroy posted a picture with  Fowler 'Two best bar men at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship' After generations when leading Americans were largely content to stay at home, the ambitious Reed and the driven Fowler are keen to sample different cultures and courses to become more complete golfers than is possible simply by playing the largely one-dimensional game required in America. Jordan Spieth, the other outstanding American under the age of 26, showed a similar willingness when he won the Australian Open in December. Reed came to prominence on this side of the Atlantic at Gleneagles when he was by far and away the top American at the Ryder Cup. Two weeks later he returned for the World Match Play Championship in London — and a love affair was born. He made it clear that week he was keen on broadening his horizons, and by taking out membership he has shown how keen. McIlroy and Fowler pose for a promo shoot ahead of the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship on Thursday . McIlroy (left) shakes hands with Fowler (right) after an emphatic 5&4 victory at the Ryder Cup in Gleneagles . If truth be told, European Tour membership makes perfect sense for those with ambition. Given the four majors and the four WGC (World Golf Championship) events count, a player just has to compete in five other tournaments to meet the minimum membership requirement. Take Fowler. He is playing here, the Irish Open and the Scottish Open. If he follows his appearance in the HSBC WGC-Champions event in Shanghai in November by staying to play in the BMW Masters, he will be eligible to play in the final event in the Race to Dubai and so fulfil the criteria. ‘It’s definitely something I am thinking about going forward,’ said the Californian. ‘When you think it’s only a few more events and if you’re playing well you can really be part of the Race to Dubai, it’s definitely a possibility.’ Exciting times and not just for Reed, at the start of the traditional three-week Middle East swing that signals a new campaign, with all eyes on Fowler and McIlroy this morning. Fowler pictured during a practice round in Abu Dhabi ahead of the start of the tournament on Thursday . These two forged something of a burgeoning rivalry last year, and while Fowler lost out narrowly at The Open and the USPGA and received a fearful walloping in the singles at the Ryder Cup, he’s smart enough and good enough to ensure that future trophy presentations are at least tinged with his trademark orange. ‘I feel we’re just at the start of what’s going to be a lot of fun and some heated battles at times over the rest of our careers,’ said Fowler. ‘We all know how good Rory is, and if he gets his driving going like he did last summer, that’s something I can’t match up with as far as distance goes. ‘But I don’t feel like my game is any weaker than his, or anything like that. McIlroy held off Fowler to win the Open (left) and the USPGA Championship (right) in 2014 . ‘I’ve beaten him a couple of times in the past and I believe I will come out on top a few more times in the future.’ Fowler, 26, finished in the top five in all four majors last year, with the somewhat mixed blessing of becoming the only player ever to achieve that feat without winning one. The USPGA was the one that really hurt, but even there he only bowed the knee owing to some stunning play from McIlroy down the stretch. And so it is only right they march stride by stride over the first two days here. It might just set the tone for the season.","Rory McIlroy edged Rickie Fowler to win 2014 Open and USPGA Majors .

'The Boston Celtics have acquired a future conditional Minnesota first-round pick and a trade exception from the Phoenix Suns in exchange for forward/center Brandan Wright,' the team stated on its website. He's an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season, and with Boston in rebuilding mode, the team was better off dealing the 27-year-old than letting him leave in the offseason for nothing. Between his time with the Celtics and Dallas Mavericks, the 27-year-old was averaging 7.5 points, 3.6 rebounds and 1.3 blocks a game.

After some initial pushing, Garnett then threw the ball at Howard, then headbutted him, sparking a fight between the two teams. After the dust settled, KG was ejected, while Howard stayed in the game. Unfortunately for the Nets, Garnett's extracurriculars were the high point of the game.

"Giannis Antetokounmpo is relishing to opportunity to play in front of a sold-out crowd in London on Thursday night on his return to Europe. The 20-year-old known as ‘the Greek freak’ has become one of the star players in a young Milwaukee Bucks team since moving to the States from his native Greece two years ago. Giannis practised with his team-mates at the O2 Arena on Wednesday ahead of their clash with the New York Knicks, and he is looking forward to putting on a show for the London crowd.

Khris Middleton drives past Jerryd Bayless during the practice session at the O2 Arena in London . ‘I feel great and very happy that I’m going to play in Europe and I think we’re going to have fun,’ Giannis said after practice. ‘I have been out and went to Tower Bridge and had a picture. London is really nice and the weather is nice because in Milwaukee the weather is really bad. ‘I’m going to have about 15 to 17 of my people here including my coach from my Greek team and my friends and we are going to have fun. I’m going to take them for dinner after the game and we will spend some time together.’ In the two years he has spent in Milwaukee since leaving Greece and entering the NBA draft, Giannis has become one of the most exciting young players in the league. The Greek star is the second highest scorer for the Bucks this season behind only point guard Brandon Knight, and his form has been instrumental in helping his team get off to a strong start this season in their bid to make the play-offs. ‘I came into the league and didn’t know what to expect,’ he said. ‘But I know how competitive I am and I wanted to be as good as possible. I have been listening to my coaches and when you work hard it pays off. ‘My coach and my parents are telling me all the time that the sky is the limit. If I keep working hard nobody knows where I could reach. My goal is to be an All Star player and to play in a winning team. Giannis warms up during the training session (left), while Brandon Knight practises his passing . Giannis hugs the Champions League trophy during his side's visit to Stamford Bridge . Members of the Milwaukee Bucks pose for a team photo while standing near the Tower Bridge in London . ‘Everyday coach Kidd gives me advice and has me talking to great players like Hakeem Olajuwon and Dikembe Mutumbo. It was fun to talk to Hakeem. He is from Nigeria and so are my parents. He told me to work hard and stay away from temptation, just stay away from drugs - I told him not to worry.’ For a youngster who has moved away from home to pursue his career, Giannis displays incredible confidence and is very relaxed. Point guard Knight said that the 20-year-old is ‘a pleasure to be around’. Knight added: ‘He is a very talented guy and young player and has grown a lot and has got better since he has been in the NBA.’ Knight has been one of the leading point guards in the league this season, and his performances led to calls for him to be included in the All Star game. The 23-year-old is already one of the more senior players in the team and is averaging 18.2 points per game, but insists there is still more to come. ‘I know I’m going to continue to get better and improve my game and it is just a matter of trying to win games,’ Knight said. I’m happier with how our team is doing and want to continue to win games.’ Knight made his second trip to London in the space of two years having travelled to England with the Detroit Pistons in January 2013 for their game against the Knicks. He said: ‘You kind of know what to expect and once your body goes through it once it is a bit more used to it the next time. ‘I knew that this time I wanted to experience London a bit more whereas first time I just wanted to rest and be prepared for the game. I’m a little bit older now and wanted to take advantage of our time here. ‘When you get to play in front of a different group of fans who don’t see you very often it is big time. ‘I went to Chelsea, went to Buckingham Palace and did some shopping, so there are a lot of different things we don’t get to experience in the States that we get to experience here.’ Bucks head coach Kidd speaks to the media in the build up to his side's match against the New York Knicks . Two years ago at the O2 Arena, Knight came up against his current coach Jason Kidd, who then played for the Knicks. Kidd has made his third trip to London in as many seasons, having also travelled over 12 months ago to coach the Brooklyn Nets to victory over the Atlanta Hawks. Unlike Knight, though, Kidd has already done all the sightseeing he needs to in London. ‘I’m a regular here now so all the sightseeing I have done in the past two years,’ the Bucks coach said. ‘I’ve just relaxed and prepared for the game. I love the culture and the food here - even the weather is warmer than Milwaukee so we will take it.’ Kidd is only in his second season as an NBA head coach having been traded to the Bucks by the Nets in the summer, and wants to continue to grow with his young team. He said: ‘I’m still learning how to be a coach. Last year in Brooklyn I had a veteran ball club but this year in Milwaukee I have one of the second youngest teams in the league. ‘We both learn off each other, but these young men have been playing extremely well in the first half of the season so I still have a lot to learn about being a coach in this league.’","Milwaukee Bucks practised at the O2 Arena on Wednesday afternoon .

"Ever since he turned professional Rory McIlroy has passed away the time on his first flight each year by marking down his goals for the season on the back of his boarding pass. And while the seat numbers have got progressively lower — this year’s targets are written on the back of 1A — his targets are now so sky-high he didn’t even tick them all off last season, when he won two majors. ‘Still a pretty good year, though,’ he said, with tongue firmly in cheek. Rory McIlroy  (right) and caddie JP Fitzgerald (left) know all roads lead to the Masters at Augusta in April . Justin Rose (third left), Rickie Fowler (third right) and Henrik Stenson (second right) joined McIlroy . McIlroy posted a picture of himself with Ricky Fowler and the caption 'Two best bar men at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship' This year the list extends to seven items and while he has no intention of making them public — that really would be making a rod for his own back — you can be pretty sure that the first two will be to complete the career Grand Slam at the Masters in April and defend his Open title in July on his favourite course, St Andrews. ‘The boarding pass stays in the wallet and then on the last flight of the year I take it out and see how well I’ve done,’ he said. ‘I’ve never managed to achieve all my goals in any year, so I aim pretty high. But it’s good to see the seat numbers are coming down. It was 13B and then 12A and so on and now it’s down to 1A. I guess the ultimate goal is to have a boarding pass with no seat number on it at all.’ If truth be told, McIlroy is now comfortably in the income bracket where he could fly the world by private jet, and invariably does for anything but long-haul flights. But there is one blot on the horizon threatening to blow a nasty hole in that wallet, both in terms of income and his season’s goals. McIlroy is hoping to go even better this year than his Open and US PGA Championship wins of 2014 . McIlroy's swing looked to be in good shape in a Facebook video he posted last week . It concerns the bitter court case looming with his former management company Horizon Sports. McIlroy is both suing and being countersued, with the result being he is likely to spend a good deal of next month in a Dublin courtroom, including a lengthy spell on the witness stand. Given what is at stake — McIlroy stands to lose tens of millions of pounds if the judgment goes against him — you might think it has the potential to be a serious distraction with the Masters just around the corner. If so, McIlroy did a pretty good job of disguising it. ‘Why would it distract me?’ he said. ‘I’ve just got to get up there and tell the truth. I’ve literally not thought about it since whenever it was that I last had to talk to someone about it. It’s no big deal. I will be OK at the end of the day.’ In fact, when it comes to distractions regarding the Masters, when he will be trying to win a third successive major, he is more wary of the hype that will inevitably grow as the big week draws closer. To that end, he will change his routine of playing the week before at the Houston Open. Aware he would hardly get a moment’s peace, Plan A will now see him play in the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Florida in mid-March instead, giving him a fortnight away from the spotlight to prepare for Augusta. ‘It might change in the sense if I feel I need some tournament golf I will definitely go to Houston, but that’s my thinking at the minute,’ said McIlroy. Also in his thinking is starting the year off with a victory. For the eighth year in a row, McIlroy is kicking off here at the HSBC Abu Dhabi Championship, which starts on Thursday, and a rare furrow creases his brow when he recalls the various self-inflicted ways he has managed to keep himself out of the winner’s circle. The Ulsterman looked in good spirits during his press conference in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday morning . McIlroy is looking forward to defending his Open title, which will be staged at St Andrews in 2015 . Winning The Masters at Augusta is 25-year-old's primary objective this season . Take last year, when he picked up the daftest of two-shot penalties for failing to take full relief from ground under repair and lost out to Pablo Larrazabal. Or 2012, when another two-shot penalty for brushing away sand that was not on the green cost him the trophy. ‘Keeping the right side of the rule book would certainly help,’ was McIlroy’s laconic response. ‘I definitely feel like there’s some unfinished business with this tournament, and I’m looking forward to getting out there. After what I achieved last year, I feel like I am going into this season with momentum.’ Not to mention a golden ticket containing a seven-point plan to rule the world once more.","Rory McIlroy plays for first time in 2015 at the Abu Dhabi Championship .

"Jermain Defoe is set to sign for Sunderland to spearhead Gus Poyet's attempts to guide the club away from the Premier League relegation zone. Providing the deal is completed in time, the 32-year-old could make his debut against former club Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Saturday, where he will look to continue a remarkable trend of scoring on every debut he has had for each of his clubs. He scored the winner and led West Ham to victory over Walsall on his debut in 2000, before marking the first appearance of a loan spell to Bournemouth with a goal in a 2-1 defeat to Stoke. Defoe celebrates scoring on his Tottenham debut after 13 minutes in a 4-3 win over Portsmouth . When Defoe made his Portsmouth debut, he scored the goal that earned his team a point at home to Chelsea . Defoe departed West Ham for a move to Tottenham in 2004 and scored after 13 minutes in his first game for the club, a 4-3 win over Portsmouth. And Portsmouth became the next destination for Defoe in 2008 and the striker instantly endeared himself to the Fratton Park faithful by earning the south coast side a point in a 1-1 draw with Chelsea. While the move to the Stadium of Light brings an end to an unhappy spell with Toronto FC for Defoe, life got off to a brilliant start with a double in his first game against Seattle Sounders. Defoe (right) beats a tackle from Djimi Traore (left) to score on his Toronto FC debut against Seattle Sounders .

It would be hard for the home faithful to be too critical of Bale following the 3-0 win on Saturday though, with his stunning free-kick doubling the Galacticos' lead before the half-time interval. Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo himself has urged the Madrid fans to go easy on Bale, insisting he is a very important part of Carlo Ancelotti's side.

"Jose Mourinho broke his silence but had not changed his tune, reiterating his belief that there is a campaign putting pressure on referees to treat Chelsea unfairly. The Portuguese offered some praise for the work of Premier League officials but claimed they could be swayed by the media and other managers. Mourinho said he didn’t have a chance of successfully contesting an FA charge for claiming there was a ‘campaign’ against Chelsea after they were denied a penalty in a 1-1 draw against Southampton last month. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho on Phil Down and refereeing standards . Mourinho went through a full range of emotions during his press conference on Friday . Mourinho is said to have berated referee Phil Dowd over his performance in the 5-3 defeat at Tottenham . The Chelsea boss allegedly described Dowd as being 'too fat to referee' and told him he should retire . Dowd talks to Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas during the Blues' defeat at Tottenham . Dowd attempts to restore order as Chelsea and Tottenham players squabble during the clash . He is unlikely to be further charged over yesterday’s comments as he appears to be defending his position. ‘Referees are not guilty,’ he said. ‘They want to do their best but clearly there are measures and there are ways of reacting, and with my club and myself there are different standards.’ Mourinho drew on perceived examples, ranging from Arsene Wenger not being given a stadium ban for pushing Mourinho at Stamford Bridge to Eden Hazard not receiving protection from referees. ‘You could say Hazard is a player with more fouls against him than anyone,’ said Mourinho, ‘Chelsea is the team with more attacks and shots and dominance, and with the fewest penalties. That is a big contradiction. ‘Hazard is still the pure, naive boy he was as a kid. For him to go on the floor, it has to be nasty and he has no protection. That is the reality.’ Mourinho also refused to deny telling referee Phil Dowd he was ‘too fat to referee and should retire’ after Chelsea’s 5-3 defeat at Tottenham on New Years Day. But Mourinho focused his blame on the environment in which referees operate and said: ‘For the players to express themselves they must feel no pressure. ‘With them (referees) it has to be exactly the same thing. They have to enjoy the matches. It is also important for them. Mourinho (right) talks to his support staff after Cesc Fabregas was booked for diving against Southampton . Fabregas was shocked after being denied a penalty and is instead booked for simulation . Fabregas appears to be brought down by Southampton's Matt Targett during the match at St Mary's . Mourinho added his weight to calls for officials to be able to see live replays of incidents adding that he now felt ‘worried’ every time Chelsea play in a competition without goal line technology. ‘I want them to be able to see replays,’ he said. ‘We can speak to them 30 minutes after the game, sometimes we go and the words are the normal ones: well done and so on. Other times we discuss what happened. ‘With Phil, he made a big mistake and was not happy. I go in a privileged position because I have seen it on TV.’","Jose Mourinho was left furious with referee after 5-3 defeat to Tottenham .

"American Rickie Fowler looked forward to playing alongside Rory McIlroy in the first two rounds of the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship here this week and confidently predicted: ’We’re going to have some fun and plenty of heated battles in the years to come.’ They made a good start on that front last year, when the Northern Irishman pipped the colourful Californian to both the Open and the USPGA Championship, before wiping the floor with him in a singles match at the Ryder Cup. Yet the gritty Fowler is far from daunted, and believes he will win plenty of such tussles himself in the future. Rory McIlroy (second left) and Rickie Fowler (second right) pose during a photoshoot in Abu Dhabi . Fowler pictured during a practice round in Abu Dhabi ahead of the start of the tournament on Thursday . Fowler is looking to renew his rivalry with McIlroy during his first tournament in the Middle East . McIlroy posted a picture with  Fowler and the caption 'Two best bar men at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship' ‘He may have had some better ball-striking than me at times last year but I don’t feel like my game is any weaker than his or anything like that,’ said the 25 year old. ‘I’ve come out on top a couple of times against him and he just happened to come out on top a few more times than me last season.’ Fowler burst back into the limelight last year after a couple of disappointing campaigns. He first hit the headlines when he defeated McIlroy in a sudden death play-off to win the 2012 Wells Fargo Championship and a long rivalry between the pair was predicted, only for Fowler to fall off the charts. Armed with a swing rebuilt by Butch Harmon, that all changed last year as Fowler finished in the top five in all four majors – the only man ever to achieve such a feat without winning one. Now he wants to make that final step and win one - and knows he is going to have to get past McIlroy to achieve it. ‘To me it feels like we’re really just at the start and we’re going to be meeting up an awful lot over the rest of our careers. We know how tough he is to beat, and particularly if he is driving the ball like he did through the summer last year. Make no mistake, he is a great player. But I am confident I can win my share.’ Fowler and McIlroy both come from similar backgrounds, so it is perhaps not surprising that this is a rivalry of the most friendly kind. Both had parents who did extra jobs to give their offspring a chance. Both were obsessed by golf from an early age. The mutual respect that they have was underlined when McIlroy took over as tournament host for the Irish Open at Royal County Down in May and Fowler pledged to come over and support the event. McIlroy (left) shakes hands with Fowler (right) after an emphatic 5&4 victory at the Ryder Cup in Gleneagles . McIlroy, pictured during the Abu Dhabi pro-am, has finished as runner-up three times in the tournament . McIlroy held off Fowler to win the Open (left) and the USPGA Championship (right) in 2014 . This will be Fowler’s first appearance in the Middle East but it will not be his last. Indeed, he is so enamoured about playing golf outside the United States that he is giving serious consideration to taking out membership of the European Tour, as well as the PGA Tour. ‘It is definitely something to look at,’ he confirmed. As well as here and the Irish, Fowler is also likely to play the Scottish Open. Add in the majors and the WGCs, and he would only have to add one more event - the DP World Tour Championship, for example - to become a member. As for the Ryder Cup, Fowler is part of the 11 man Task Force charged with trying to get to the bottom of why America always loses. ‘We’ve had just one meeting so far but I think getting all of us together and more involved will help us going forward,’ he said. ‘We need to reach the point in two years where we’re able to put up a better fight and get that Ryder Cup back on our home soil.’","Rickie Fowler is preparing for first golfing appearance in the Middle East .

"Eoin Morgan insisted he already has ‘the best group of players’ with him in Australia in an effort to end for good the almost daily saga of Kevin Pietersen attempting to keep his name in the England frame. England’s new one-day captain again found himself answering questions about the exiled star when he arrived in Sydney for this morning’s resumption of hostilities with the old enemy. England suffered problems in making the journey from Canberra when their flight was cancelled and then when they experienced turbulence on the replacement before Morgan was given a bumpy ride by the Australian press. Then-England team-mates Eoin Morgan and Kevin Pietersen together at a practice session in Dubai in 2012 . Pietersen has been playing for the Melbourne Stars against the Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash League . Morgan (right) speaks with Alex Hales on Thursday during training at the Sydney Cricket Ground . Morgan (left) replaced Alastair Cook as England's one-day captain shortly before Christmas . Pietersen said Morgan wanted him back in the England side in an excruciating ‘interview’ with Ricky Ponting during a Big Bash game when the former Australia captain took his opportunity to stir the English pot. But, just as he did in Canberra on Sunday, Morgan insisted there was no way back for Pietersen when he spoke at the Sydney Cricket Ground before the first one-day international of a Tri-series that also involves India. ‘I think this is a good opportunity to clear things up given that Kevin has had a lot of opportunity to talk in the media and get his view out there,’ said Morgan. ‘I’m very happy with the group of players I have. ‘This is the best group of players we have to drive the England team forward over the next two months in particular. Kevin’s situation hasn’t changed over the last year. It’s been re-iterated over months and days. Pietersen is hoping to get back into both the England ODI and Test teams . Stuart Broad (left) speaks to former England team-mate Pietersen prior to his axe from the international set-up . ‘It was reiterated by the chairman of selectors before Christmas and I’m reiterating it again just to clear it up. Thank you.’ Certainly Pietersen has done his friend no favours by putting him in a difficult position at a time when Morgan is trying to prepare for a challenging two months of one-day cricket. And the Australians have loved keeping the issue in the spotlight. But if Ponting had wanted to do a proper interview, he might have asked Pietersen why he did not play alongside him with Surrey more often last summer if he truly was serious about playing international cricket again. Morgan refused to answer when asked if England would be a stronger side here with Pietersen in it. ‘I think that’s a terrible question,’ said Morgan. ‘Kevin is not in the side, and won’t be for the foreseeable future, so there’s no point answering.’ The bottom line is that England have long since decided to move on without a player who became more trouble than he is worth. Morgan smiles as he waits to bat during a net session as the SCG on Thursday . Ian Bell strikes the ball during his record-breaking innings against a Prime Minister's XI on Wednesday . And two half-centuries in an Australian Twenty20 event does not change that. If Pietersen wanted to help his friend as he tries to compete against the two best one-day sides in the world over the next two weeks and then the World Cup surely he would be better off keeping quiet. So will he go easy on Morgan now? ‘I’ve no idea and it really doesn’t bother me either way,’ insisted the Irishman. ‘We’ve always separated things on the field from things we’ve done off it and I’m very comfortable with that.’ Morgan believes England’s one-day batting line-up is now the most powerful he has known, as perhaps they began to show while scoring 364 and 391 in their two warm-up games in Canberra. ‘Certainly that’s the case in England teams I’ve played in,’ said the man who replaced Alastair Cook at the helm before this tour. England captain Morgan shares a joke with his team before posing for a team photo at the SCG on Thursday .

Bottom row: Steven Finn, Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Eoin Morgan, James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Jos Buttler . ‘We saw in Canberra, and at various stages in the past year, that when we perform to our potential we are a dangerous side.’ And the man who might have been forced to go into this morning’s first one-day international without Jimmy Anderson as he is nursed back to full fitness is adamant there will be no psychological issues for England in returning to the scene of their 5-0 Ashes humiliation. ‘I think we have a reasonable record home and away against Australia in recent years,’ insisted Morgan. ‘The result in the one-day series here last year didn’t really reflect how we played. Brisbane and Adelaide in particular were games we would have won in the past, but the guys were low on confidence and we failed to get across the line.’ Fast-bowler Anderson is a doubt for England's ODI with Australia at the SCG on Friday .","England play Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday .

"Liverpool and Chelsea meet at Anfield on Tuesday night in the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final. The two sides have a recent history of producing memorable moments in cup competitions, with a number of fierce battles in the Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup over the last decade. Here, we take a look at the games which have defined one of football's modern rivalries. Steven Gerrard (left) and John Terry have enjoyed plenty of intense battles over the last decade . 2005 CARLING CUP FINAL - LIVERPOOL 2-3 CHELSEA (AFTER EXTRA-TIME) Jose Mourinho's first piece of silverware as Chelsea manager came courtesy of an extraordinary League Cup final success over Liverpool at the Millennium Stadium. John Arne Riise put Rafa Benitez's side ahead with a volley inside the opening minute but a Steven Gerrard own-goal took the final into extra-time. Mourinho was sent off during normal time but watched Didier Drogba and Mateja Kezman both strike to put his side in control, with the Blues able to hold on for the win despite Antonio Nunez reducing the deficit with a late header. Mateja Kezman (left) celebrates scoring against Liverpool in the 2005 Carling Cup final . 2005 CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI-FINAL - LIVERPOOL 1-0 CHELSEA (ON AGGREGATE) Later that same season the two sides met for a place in the Champions League final, with Mourinho looking to defend the trophy he had won at Porto the year before. After a goalless first leg at Stamford Bridge, controversy reigned as Luis Garcia scored the only goal of the game on four minutes to send Liverpool into the final in Istanbul. Garcia's 'ghost goal' caused hysteria among Chelsea's camp as the ball did not appear to cross the line before being hacked away by William Gallas - but it was the Reds who went on to win their fifth European Cup after a penalty shootout victory over AC Milan in the final. Liverpool midfielder Luis Garcia (right) watches as his 'ghost goal' is given against Chelsea in 2005 . 2005-06 CHAMPIONS LEAGUE GROUP STAGE - BOTH GAMES 0-0 . After winning the Champions League but finishing fifth in the Premier League, Liverpool were invited to take part in the competition again. However, they were not afforded country protection and were subsequently paired with Chelsea in the group stages. This time there was nothing between them, with both games ending in goalless draws. Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina gets down low to deny Chelsea winger Damien Duff at Anfield . 2006 FA CUP SEMI-FINAL - LIVERPOOL 2-1 CHELSEA . The two teams met once again in a cup competition when they were drawn against each other in the FA Cup semi-finals. John Arne Riise opened the scoring for the Reds at Old Trafford, before Luis Garcia netted another goal against Mourinho's men. Didier Drogba grabbed a goal for the Blues but they couldn't prevent Benitez's side reaching the final against West Ham, a game they won via a dramatic penalty shootout. Liverpool defender John Arne Riise sweeps home his side's first goal in their 2-1 FA Cup semi-final win . 2007 CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI-FINAL - LIVERPOOL 1-1 CHELSEA (ON AGGREGATE, LIVERPOOL WON 4-1 ON PENALTIES) Joe Cole's strike at Stamford Bridge gave Chelsea a 1-0 advantage heading into the game at Anfield, but once again Liverpool found a way to reach the final. Defender Daniel Agger swept home the equaliser to force extra-time, before Pepe Reina made himself a hero by saving spot-kicks from Arjen Robben and Geremi in a shootout. The Reds faced AC Milan once again in the final but this time they couldn't conjure up a miracle, eventually going down 2-1 in Athens.

Second-half goals from Frank Lampard and the much-maligned Andriy Shevchenko were enough for Chelsea as they cruised into the semi-finals of the Carling Cup. Liverpool striker Peter Crouch saw red for a reckless tackle on John Obi Mikel as the visitors to Stamford Bridge exited the competition. The Blues went on to reach the final but were defeated in extra-time by London rivals Tottenham. 2008 CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI-FINAL - CHELSEA 4-3 LIVERPOOL (ON AGGREGATE) Chelsea were the side celebrating when the two teams met in the semi-finals this time - with the match following a similar script to their 2005 League Cup final encounter. Having drawn 1-1 at Anfield, Drogba drilled Chelsea ahead only for future Blues striker Fernando Torres to level and send the game into extra-time. There, a Frank Lampard penalty and a second of the night for Drogba put Avram Grant's Chelsea on course for the final and they reached Moscow - where they would lose on penalties to Manchester United - despite Ryan Babel scoring a late consolation for Liverpool. Frank Lampard scores from the spot during Chelsea's 4-3 aggregate win against Liverpool in 2008 . 2009 CHAMPIONS LEAGUE QUARTER-FINAL - CHELSEA 7-5 LIVERPOOL (ON AGGREGATE) The teams met yet again, this in the last eight of the 2008-09 competition, with Chelsea holding a 3-1 advantage after an impressive win at Anfield. But Liverpool threatened to stage a remarkable comeback as a Fabio Auerilo free-kick and Xabi Alonso's penalty put Benitez's side back in the tie with a 2-0 half-time lead. The fightback was ended before the hour however, as Drogba and Alex struck for the hosts - with Lampard adding a third before Lucas and Dirk Kuyt put Liverpool back in front on the night. Lampard levelled late on to end the scoring and take Guus Hiddink's side into a semi-final with Barcelona that ended with the Spaniards qualifying for the final. Chelsea's Alex (hidden) is mobbed by team-mates after making it 2-2 on the night at Stamford Bridge in 2009 . 2011-12 CARLING CUP QUARTER FINAL - CHELSEA 0-2 LIVERPOOL . Blues boss Andre Villas-Boas was put under more pressure after this home defeat, which was secured by two goals in the space of just five minutes. Maxi Rodriguez and Martin Kelly struck for the visitors in the second half as an under-strength Chelsea side were dumped out at the last-eight stage. The Reds continued their cup form by making it all the way to the final, eventually beating Championship outfit Cardiff on penalties to lift the trophy. Martin Kelly (No 34) heads home Liverpool's second goal in their 2-0 win at Stamford Bridge in 2011 . 2012 FA CUP FINAL - CHELSEA 2 - 1 LIVERPOOL . Chelsea, under interim manager Roberto Di Matteo, got the better of Kenny Dalglish's Liverpool as Drogba once again proved the thorn in their side. The Ivory Coast striker netted his fourth FA Cup final goal to double Chelsea's advantage after Ramires had put them in front at half-time. Liverpool rallied and the introduction of Andy Carroll from the bench caused problems for the Blues defence, with the former Newcastle man pulling a goal back before seeing a header tipped on to the bar by Petr Cech.

"Pep Guardiola brought joy to Barcelona fans during a four-year spell as manager, but the Bayern Munich Boss disappointed one supporter of the Catalan club when he refused to sign his shirt. Bayern have been preparing for the return of the Bundesliga later this month following the winter break with a warm-weather training camp in Doha, Qatar. After a session Guardiola made his way over to a group of supporters that had gathered on the side of the pitch to sign autographs and have his picture taken. One supporter held out a Barcelona shirt for Bayern boss Pep Guardiola to sign . Guardiola waved his finger in the supporter's direction as he refused to sign the shirt of his former club . Guardiola quickly moved on to another Bayern fan as he bypassed the Barcelona shirt . But when a Barcelona shirt was thrust in his direction by one hopeful fan the 43-year-old refused to sign it and simply wagged a disapproving finger in their direction and moved on. The Bayern head coach has recently been touted as a replacement for Luis Enrique at the Nou Camp after reports of fall-outs between the head coach and some of the senior players, including Lionel Messi. But Guardiola rubbished speculation he could be set for a sensational return to the club and on this evidence the Bayern boss wants to avoid any affiliation with his former side whatsoever.
