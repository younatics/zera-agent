"Richmond, California (CNN) -- Investigators say as many as 20 people were involved in or stood and watched the gang rape of a 15-year-old girl outside a California high school homecoming dance Saturday night. Police posted a $20,000 reward Tuesday for anyone who comes to them with information that helps arrest and convict those involved in what authorities describe as a 2½-hour assault on the Richmond High School campus in suburban San Francisco. Two teenage suspects have been jailed, but more arrests, as many as 20 total, are expected, according to a police detective. ""We will be making arrests continually as we develop probable cause,"" said Richmond Police Lt. Mark Gagan. ""With this number of people implicated in the incident we're going to be making arrests on an ongoing basis."" As many as 10 people were involved in the assault in a dimly lighted back alley at the school, while another 10 people watched without calling 911 to report it, police said. A 1999 California law makes it illegal not to report a witnessed crime against a child, but the law applies only to children 14 and under. ""We do not have the ability to arrest people who witnessed the crime and did nothing,"" Gagan said. ""The law can be very rigid. We don't have the authority to make an arrest."" Charles Ramsey, a member of the Richmond school board, said the school district bears some responsibility for the attack. School administrators and police apparently weren't watching the area as they should have, Ramsey said. The school said it would hold a safety meeting for parents and students Wednesday evening to address the assault. The victim was found unconscious under a bench shortly before midnight Saturday, after police received a call from someone in the area who had overheard people at the assault scene ""reminiscing about the incident,"" Richmond Police Lt. Mark Gagan said. The girl was flown by helicopter to a hospital where she was admitted in critical condition. She was in stable condition Tuesday, police said. Investigators canvassed the community with fliers, which included the reward offer, hoping to identify more suspects Tuesday. ""There is one individual in custody who has made some spontaneous statements that have led me to believe that he is culpable for what happened,"" Richmond police Lt. Johan Simon said. Nineteen-year-old Manuel Ortega, described as a former student at the school, was arrested soon after he fled the scene and will face charges of rape, robbery and kidnapping, police said. A 15-year-old was later arrested and charged with one count of felony sexual assault. A third teenager was being interviewed, Gagan said. ""Based on witness statements and suspect statements, and also physical evidence, we know that she was raped by at least four suspects committing multiple sex acts,"" Gagan said. ""As people announced over time that this was going on, more people came to see, and some actually participated,"" Gagan said. The attack occurred on school grounds as the annual homecoming dance was under way inside the school Saturday night, authorities said.","10 people involved in assault, 10 others watched and offered no help, police say .

"Honduras has the world's highest murder rate, according to a United Nations report released on Thursday. There were 90.4 homicides per 100,000 people in Honduras in 2012, according to this year's report from the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime. The report analyzes the intentional homicides of about 437,000 people around the world in that year. Honduras also topped the list in the office's last report, released in 2011. In the Americas, homicide rates have been five to eight times higher than those of Europe and Asia since the mid-1950s, the study says, describing the phenomenon as ""the legacy of decades of political and crime-related violence."" Here's a look at the U.N.'s latest tally of nations with the highest homicide rates: . COUNTRIES . Honduras: 90.4 (per 100,000) Venezuela: 53.7 . Belize: 44.7 . El Salvador: 41.2 . Guatemala: 39.9 .

"A Louisiana man who spent 15 years on death row for a murder he did not commit was released Friday from prison in an exoneration brought about by the Innocence Project. ""It's been a long journey,"" Damon A. Thibodeaux, 38, said during a news conference with his lawyers. ""It's people like y'all who give people like us a chance."" Thibodeaux, who was convicted after falsely confessing to having raped and murdered his 14-year-old step-cousin, said he hopes law enforcement will learn from his case. ""Make sure you have the right person before you start a process of executing someone,"" he said. ""Because it costs a lot of money to go back and look at all of these cases again. If it's done right the first time, you shouldn't have to do that."" Thibodeaux described as ""surreal"" his walk earlier in the day out of Louisiana State Penitentiary. ""It's not something you can prepare yourself for, because you've been living in those conditions for so long."" Asked how he felt, Thibodeaux  did not hesitate. ""Free,"" he said. ""I feel free. I feel free."" Former inmate exonerated in rape case joins pro football team . Initially, he said, he felt like giving up, but resisted the temptation. ""The minute you give up completely is the minute you die,"" he said. ""Period."" Thibodeaux said that he was looking forward to ""peace and quiet ... just concentrating on putting my life back together and moving forward."" His court-ordered release came after DNA and other evidence exonerated him. Jefferson Parish District Attorney Paul Connick Jr. agreed with Thibodeaux's lawyers that he had confessed to something he did not do. Connick ""joined the Innocence Project and Thibodeaux's other counsel in agreeing to overturn Thibodeaux's conviction and death sentence after his confession to police was determined to be false,"" the district attorney said in a statement. ""This is a damn good day at the office,"" said Denise LeBoeuf, director of the ACLU Capital Punishment Project, who has represented Thibodeaux since 1998. The case points to the need to abolish the death penalty, she said. ""It doesn't make us safer; it makes the pain of murder worse; and if we can't figure out how to have a death penalty that doesn't put innocent men on death row and innocent women on death row across the country, then we don't deserve to have it. It is a human rights violation. We need to end it now."" Thibodeaux was convicted of killing his relative, Crystal Champagne, whose body was found on July 20, 1996, a day after she left her apartment to go to a nearby supermarket. More than 2,000 wrongfully convicted people exonerated in 23 years, researchers say . He was among a number of people who were interviewed by police. After some nine hours of interrogation, ""he provided an apparent confession to raping and murdering the victim,"" the ACLU said in a news release. Primarily on that basis, Thibodeaux was convicted and sentenced to death in October 1997, it said. A decade later, his legal team gave evidence to the district attorney of Thibodeaux's innocence and an investigation -- which wound up involving hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of DNA testing, forensic evidence and interviews -- got under way. ""The probe confirmed that Thibodeaux's confession was false in every significant aspect,"" the ACLU said. Since 2000, six people have been released from Louisiana's death row after being exonerated; in that time, three people have been executed, it said. ""What we were doing was searching for the truth,"" said Barry Scheck, co-director of the Innocence Project, which is affiliated with New York's Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. ""We hope that justice is done and we find the person who really committed the crime."" He said Thibodeaux was the 300th person exonerated through DNA testing. Asked what might have led Thibodeaux to confess, Scheck said, ""That is something that we're studying and is part of the lessons to be learned here. That's not one of the things that I think is probably appropriate for us to discuss at the moment."" The case points to the need for police to videotape interrogations, according to Scheck. Had that been done in this case, ""we wouldn't be sitting here today,"" Scheck said. ""It's a simple thing to do and it's sweeping the country.""

"When it comes to the gender pay gap, the cynics have used smoke and mirrors to deny the truth while Congress continues to come up short on critical legislation. So now, the President is not waiting another minute to make real progress. He is taking action. On Tuesday, President Barack Obama continued his ""year of action"" by signing two new executive orders to strengthen enforcement of equal pay laws where Congress has so far failed to act. He also challenged the Senate to ""start making this right"" by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act when it comes up for a vote on Wednesday. The Senate has tried twice, but the act was blocked by a handful of stubborn Republicans. But even before the ink was dry on his executive orders, wage-gap deniers were trotting out the same old tired arguments we've heard for years.  Rationalizing or outright denying that pay inequity exists, and dismissing the equal pay push as a political ploy designed to distract from other, ""real"" issues. Yet for millions of women struggling on the brink of poverty, the wage gap is all too real. Despite increasing education and greater professional success, women in the aggregate still make less than men: on average, 77 cents on the dollar, and even less if you are black or Latina.  This persistent pay gap has real implications for women and their families, especially when 40% of our nation's households with children rely on women as a primary or sole source of income. That 23-cent disparity means a yearly wage gap for women of more than $11,000.  And what does that translate into? On average, working women in the United States can afford 91 fewer weeks of food for their families, 13 fewer months of rent, and more than 3,000 fewer gallons of gas per year as compared to men. It's not surprising then that polls rank equal pay for equal work as a top issue for women across the country. More people prefer a male boss, but gender gap is narrowing . But like a bad magician, the naysayers are trying to use smoke and mirrors to fool us into believing the problem is just an illusion.  They say the wage gap is a myth, based on anecdotes, not data. They say there's no need for new laws, because it's already illegal to discriminate. Any differences that remain, they say, can be explained away by personal choices. While it's true the wage gap is due to a combination of factors, study after study has shown the wage gap — as much as 40% of it — holds true even when we control for factors such as education level, profession or position.  It cannot be fully explained by personal choices, and can be attributed in some measure to overt or unintentional gender-based discrimination. The gap manifests out of the gate and only widens over time.   A 2012 report from the American Association of University Women, ""Graduating to a Pay Gap,"" made an ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of college-educated women and men working full time one year out of school.  After controlling for college major, occupation, hours worked per week, economic sector, and other factors, women still made 7% less than what their male counterparts made. And in an earlier report, the association found that 10 years after graduation, the unexplained pay gap widened to 12%. Indeed, women's wages are lower in nearly all occupations -- doctors, lawyers, even low-wage workers.  And this is true regardless of whether the job is one performed predominantly by men, predominantly women, or an even mix of both. What millennial women want now . That's why we still need Congress to act, to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to ensure that all employers are held to the standards embodied in Tuesday's executive actions. This week Congress has an opportunity to go from its standing ovation for equal pay at the State of the Union to really standing up for women. When the rubber meets the road, let's hope we move beyond the rhetoric to acting on real solutions. Don't make the President take out his pen again, unless it is to sign the new law.

"Nobody ""likes"" a loser. If losing the presidential election wasn't enough, Mitt Romney has been hemorrhaging Facebook friends. People began unliking Romney's official Facebook page soon after the election results came in last week. The Washington Post noticed the drop on Friday, when the GOP presidential candidate's page was losing 593 likes an hour. By Saturday, Mashable said the exodus was up to 847 friends an hour, and as of Monday morning, Romney's Facebook page continued to lose around 11 likes every minute. For those who enjoy interactive graphics with their schadenfreude, the site DisappearingRomney.com shows Romney's Facebook likes dropping in real time. A ticker at the bottom of the page tallies how many people have unliked Romney's page just in the time users have been on the site. Not that Romney is hurting for social media pals. As of Monday afternoon, he still had more than 12 million Facebook fans and 1.7 million followers on Twitter. The former governor's team hasn't been doing much on social media lately to persuade people to stick around. After a flurry of activity leading up to the election, his official Facebook and Twitter accounts went silent for four days afterward. On Saturday, the campaign finally posted a photo of a sad-looking Romney with the message, ""From the bottom of our hearts, Ann and I thank you for your support, prayers, efforts and vote. We are forever grateful to every one of you."" By contrast, President Barack Obama acknowledged his victory last week with a pair of posts on Twitter and Facebook that quickly went viral. And his social media accounts have been active in the week since the election. Romney's recent silence extends to his running mate, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, whose campaign's Twitter account has not been updated since the election. However, Ryan did update his personal (pre-campaign) Twitter and Facebook pages with two Veterans Day posts over the weekend. The official Republican National Committee's Facebook page has also been quiet since Election Day, when it reposted a thank you to Romney from GOP Chairman Reince Priebus. After Obama was first elected four years ago, his official Twitter, Facebook and, yes, MySpace pages (it was 2008, after all) went quiet for a time. One explanation is that the staffers who manage these accounts either move on or are typically given new responsibilities after an election. It's unlikely that Obama or Romney were posting to Facebook and Twitter very often themselves.","Mitt Romney's official Facebook page has been losing 11 fans a minute .

"A former Arizona congressman was sentenced to three years in prison Monday after his June conviction on federal corruption charges. Former U.S. Rep. Rick Renzi, 54, was indicted in 2008 on charges of extortion, bribery, insurance fraud, money laundering and racketeering related to a 2005 money-laundering scheme that netted the Flagstaff Republican more than $700,000. ""Mr. Renzi abused the power -- and the corresponding trust -- that comes with being a member of Congress by putting his own financial interests over the interests of the citizens he had sworn to serve,"" said Mythili Raman, acting assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's Criminal Division. Renzi's lawyers hoped to prevent the ex-congressman's prosecution on the grounds that it would violate the Constitution's ""speech or debate"" clause, a privilege reserved for lawmakers that protects them and their staff from legal action over ""legislative"" acts. That argument was rejected throughout the appeal process. ""The Speech or Debate Clause does not make members of Congress supercitizens immune from criminal responsibility,"" the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel said in a unanimous 45-page ruling last summer. When the Supreme Court decided not to intervene in January, the trial was able to proceed. According to evidence that emerged during the six-month trial, Renzi, then representing Arizona's 1st Congressional District, promised to use his legislative influence to profit from a federal land exchange that involved property owned by his co-defendant, real-estate investor James Sandlin. Sandlin was sentenced Monday to 18 months for his role in the racket. Renzi was also accused of misappropriating money from his family insurance business to fund his campaigns and for personal benefit. ""He fleeced his own insurance company to fund his run for Congress and then exploited his position for personal gain,"" Raman said.  Mr. Renzi's conviction and today's sentence demonstrate the Justice Department's commitment to fighting corruption at the highest levels of government.""","Rick Renzi convicted in scheme to profit from federal land exchange, misusing money .

"An Alabama judge signed an order Thursday declaring Natalee Holloway legally dead, attorneys for her family said. Probate Judge Alan King signed the order after an afternoon hearing in Jefferson County court in Birmingham. Holloway was 18 when she was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving a nightclub on the Caribbean island of Aruba with Joran van der Sloot and two other men. No one was charged in her disappearance, and her body has never been found. On Wednesday, van der Sloot -- who was detained twice in connection with Holloway's disappearance but never charged -- confessed in a Lima court to murdering a 21-year-old Peruvian woman five years after Holloway went missing. Natalee's father, Dave Holloway, filed a petition to declare his daughter dead in June, six years after she went to the Caribbean island with 100 classmates to celebrate their  graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham. He was present at Thursday's hearing, as was his ex-wife, Beth Holloway. She opposed the move to declare Natalee dead, pointing to a lack of evidence indicating her daughter is deceased and saying in a September statement that she ""will always hope and pray for Natalee's safe return."" On Thursday, she told reporters while leaving the courtroom that she was upset by the judge's decision. ""Natalee's father wanted to see this through, and of course it makes me very sad,"" said Beth Holloway, who now works with groups and families of missing children. Dave Holloway acknowledged Thursday that the ruling is ""tough,"" though he said he's considered it a possibility ever since the FBI told him 10 days after his daughter went missing that they were approaching her case as a homicide. ""We've been dealing with this death for the last six and a half years,"" he told reporters Thursday. ""Hopefully, this meeting today will (provide) some closure."" In a hearing in September, King ruled the petition could go forward, according to CNN affiliate WBRC. At that time, King ruled that a notice of presumption of death must be published in a local newspaper for two successive weeks, followed by a 12-week time frame to submit any evidence the teen is still alive, WBRC said. Barring any such evidence, the judge would then be able to declare Natalee Holloway dead. Dave Holloway explained that, barring his daughter miraculously being found alive, that a decision like the one issued Thursday had to be issued ""eventually."" His attorney, Mark White, previously said that the order -- which acts as a death certificate -- will help resolve the estate of Natalee Holloway, who still has a small college fund in her name and is listed as a participant and beneficiary on her father's health insurance. Now was the proper time to pursue this action, said Dave Holloway, given his desire to take ""care of some needs"" and van der Sloot's conviction earlier this week. ""I was in a situation where a lot of things came together, with the criminal element as well as having to take care of business,"" he said. The 24-year-old Dutch national could be imprisoned for as many as 30 years when he is sentenced Friday, two days after he pleaded guilty to all the charges against him in the killing of a Peruvian woman in 2010. Investigators believe van der Sloot killed Stephany Flores after she found something related to the Holloway case on van der Sloot's computer as she visited with him in his hotel room. Van der Sloot also faces possible extradition to the United States. In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him on charges of wire fraud and extortion after allegations surfaced that he tried to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother. Van der Sloot offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of Natalee Holloway's remains in exchange for the money, according to the indictment. He was allegedly given a total of $25,000, and authorities believe he used that money to travel to Peru and participate in a poker tournament, where he met Flores. Peggy Sanford, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office for north Alabama,  said that there's no timetable as to when federal authorities will seek to bring van der Sloot to the United States for prosecution. ""We want Joran van der Sloot to face the charges here, and we are prepared to try him as soon as we can get him to the United States,"" Sanford said. ""Right now, we don't know when that will be.""","Holloway's father says ""a lot of things came together"" making now the right time .

"A pregnant prison guard was accused Tuesday of having sex with an incarcerated cop killer, according to a source close to the investigation. Federal Bureau of Prisons officer Nancy Gonzalez, 29, was arrested on suspicion of unlawful sexual abuse on a ward, according to a federal complaint. Gonzalez had relationships in 2012 with two inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, authorities said. The federal complaint did not mention the names of the inmates, but the source told CNN that one of them is Ronell Wilson, the presumed father. He was convicted of killing two police officers in March 2003. In a recorded call, according to the complaint, Gonzalez told the second inmate about her pregnancy, allegedly by the other inmate: ""I took a chance because I was so vulnerable and wanted to be loved and now I am carrying his child."" The guard said she ""kind of got sucked into his world"" and ""felt like, well, why not give him a child as far as giving him some kind of hope,"" according to the complaint. ""People find love in the strangest places, and people get together in the most difficult circumstances,"" Gonzalez's attorney, Anthony Ricco, told CNN affiliate NY1. ""We live in a society where these events happen. They are unusual, but they are not uncommon."" Gonzalez allegedly told colleagues she became pregnant in June 2012, while she was having a relationship with Wilson. She is now eight months pregnant. The Long Island resident was released Tuesday afternoon on $150,000 bond after an initial appearance. An affidavit states that there are videotapes showing Gonzalez and the inmate spending several minutes alone together at various times. Other witnesses say they were seen ""hugging and kissing."" Gonzalez could face a maximum sentence of 15 years if convicted of the charge. ""She's really distraught. I mean, she's in the worst place that a woman can be eight months pregnant,"" Ricco told NY1. In March 2007, Wilson was sentenced to death for killing the two undercover officers, James Nemorin and Rodney Andrews, on Staten Island during a gun sale. He was the first person in the city to receive the death sentence from a federal jury since 1954. His sentence was overturned in 2010 on procedural grounds. A new jury must now determine whether Wilson receives a death sentence or life in prison.","Attorney says client distraught .

"The first woman elected to the White House will answer to many names -- Madam President, ma'am, and, most likely, Mom.  That's something I like to think about on Mother's Day. Given the demographics and family status of many of the women in politics today, there's a pretty good chance that the first female who gets to sit behind the historic Resolute Desk in the Oval Office will be a mother of young children. Think that's crazy? It's not and here's why. The current female up-and-comers entered the world of politics earlier than their predecessors and are, like so many women today, waiting to have or adopt children until their 30s and 40s.  As a result, the year 2016 will likely present a perfect storm of timing and circumstances for a president to be sworn in who looks like Geena Davis' character Mackenzie Allen of the short-lived TV series, ""Commander in Chief."" I don't have a crystal ball, but I have my fingers crossed that many political mothers who are in the queue, so to speak, have their eyes on more than just keeping the jobs they have now. They're not waiting until their children are out of the house to make their next political moves. When former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was first elected to Congress, she was 47 years old and four of her five children were already out of the house and in college with the fifth one in high school. That was the model for women interested in national political office: Wait to run until the kids were grown. That is, until former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin opened the door to the idea of a young mom who could run for the White House. Even for voters who weren't fans of Palin's political views, she became the new face of women in the arena -- someone knee deep in the details of child-rearing, as well as policymaking and vote counting -- a vision that resonated because most mothers in America are working mothers juggling their own careers and families. There is a growing list of female contenders whose work-life balance stories will resonate with female voters who are also trying to find the right mix of working hours to support their families and time at home with the kids. One name to remember is Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democratic senator from New York. She is 45 and not only is she firmly ensconced in her political career, she's also the mother of two sons, ages 9 and 5. Gillibrand is on at least one short list (if Hillary Clinton keeps her word about not running for president again) of potential Democratic candidates for the White House in 2016. With the launch of her recent bipartisan Off the Sidelines project to encourage more women to run for office, as well as her online book club, it certainly looks like she's laying the social media groundwork for something in four years. As for Republican women, they've got 42-year-old Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a representative from Washington. Don't know her name? You'd probably recognize her face, because she is usually one of the few standing behind Speaker of the House John Boehner at all those news conferences. McMorris is the mother of a 1½-year-old daughter and a 5-year-old son, and wields plenty of political power and influence as the highest-ranking Republican woman in Congress. She has a major voice in what issues make it to a vote. These are just two of the high-profile political mothers who can just as easily and naturally manage the Washington power game as they can their children's homework, play dates and soccer schedules. Political women who embrace electoral leadership while parenting young children are becoming much more common. Others include Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who is also the head of the Democratic National Committee, Republican South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, and GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. The new generation of political women can bring to office a set of life experiences that will inform national policy issues in a new way. We would be able to have discussions about paid family leave, paid sick time and paid maternity leave and have it viewed through the lens of a commander in chief who would have real-time experience with what it means to leave work to pick up a sick child. There are plenty of moms to choose from for increasing powerful national leadership roles. So many female voters choreograph their own work-life balance dance. A woman who knows that struggle firsthand might just be the kind of candidate who will be elected to the Oval Office.","Joanne Bamberger: On Mother's Day, think about the idea of a woman in the White House .

"Every single week for the past 22 years, a group of elderly South Korean women has camped outside the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, enduring the heat and humidity of the region's monsoonal summer and the sub-zero temperatures of the brutal Korean winter. Why? They want an apology for being forced into sexual slavery as so-called ""comfort women"" by the Japanese military before and during World War II -- an apology that numerous Japanese governments insist has already been publicly given more than two decades ago. It has been almost 70 years since the end of World War II and yet this issue still has the power to derail relations at the very top of these two countries. The issue of ""comfort women"" is expected to be discussed when officials from Tokyo and Seoul meet Wednesday in an effort to improve frosty relations ahead of President Obama's tour of the region next week. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Park Geun-hye only met for the first time since both taking power last month.  And only then because it was organized and led by U.S. President Barack Obama, eager to heal the rifts of his country's two closest allies in the region. The two governments ""have decided to engage in intensive discussions on various subjects at various levels"" to improve conditions surrounding relations, the Japanese foreign ministry said in a statement. The issue of comfort women is an emotive one that ignites passions in both countries. Many of these women have already passed away.  Only 55 of those registered with the South Korean government are still alive. A small, but vocal voice within the Japanese opposition has been calling for a revision of the Kono statement made in 1993 -- a statement made by then Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono that accepted Japan's responsibility for recruiting ""comfort women"" and extended ""its sincere apologies and remorse."" It is this statement Hiroshi Yamada of the Japan Restoration Party wants changed. ""We are not saying the Kono statement should be nullified because we dislike it or it is irritating to the Japanese people,"" he said. ""Japan had state-run prostitution just like other countries in the world around World War II and we admit that there were unfortunately women working there."" Forgotten faces: Japan's comfort women . 'Deeply pained' Abe diluted this argument recently when he insisted Japan would not retract its apology. ""I am deeply pained to think of the comfort women who experienced immeasurable pain and suffering, a feeling I share equally with my predecessors,"" he said. But the suggestion that up to 200,000 women, mainly Korean, used by the Japanese military, were official prostitutes infuriates the former sex slaves. They insist they were forcibly taken from Korea or tricked into leaving, thinking they were being transferred to other jobs. Kim Bok Dong, 89, says she was transported to half a dozen countries over eight years by the Japanese military from the age of 14.

'Comfort women necessary' comment raises concerns . Japan-Korea relations . The issue remains heavily divisive between the two nations. ""The issue of sex slaves is no longer in the hands of the South Korean government,"" said Yang Kee Ho, a professor at Sungkonghoe University in Seoul.  ""As long as 55 former sex slaves are alive... the issue lies in the hands of the South Korean public.  They want the Japanese government to acknowledge, apologize, compensate and educate their children that their government has committed the crimes of forcing young Korean girls to sex slavery. ""No South Korean government can ignore or deviate from such national consensus without risking losing public support."" Yang said Japan also disagrees with South Korea's efforts to make this an international issue, believing it should be dealt with bi-laterally.  Wednesday's meeting between the two countries is certainly a start, but as the first such meeting, one that is expected to reap little in the short term. Hajime Izumi, a professor at Shizuoka University in central Japan, insisted more time and a generational change is needed before a resolution can be hoped for.  ""This is not that old an issue,"" he said. ""This issue only really came up in the 1990s and Japan and South Korea are looking at the issue from totally different perspectives.  They can never agree while there is such a large gap in perception. It may not be resolved for 20 years."" Japanese ex-prime minister meets comfort women .

"Protesters knocked down a statue of Vladimir Lenin on Sunday as outrage mounted over the Ukrainian government's push for closer ties with Russia. A crowd of cheering protesters chanted ""Good job"" after the statue fell in Kiev's Bessarabska Square. Some pounded the monument with hammers, leaving pieces of the statue scattered on the ground. Only parts of the Soviet hero's legs remained at the base. A man waving a Ukrainian flag stood atop the pedestal beside them. Police said they were investigating but did not know know who had toppled the monument. Ukraine's government news agency said a lawmaker with the nationalist Svoboda party claimed responsibility for the incident. ""This is the end of Soviet occupation,"" the party's Twitter account said. ""End of (the) regime of shame and humiliation."" Numerous statues of Lenin, one of the leaders of the 1917 Russian Revolution, have been removed from Kiev in recent years. The Communist Party decried the attack on the statue Sunday. ""Destroying the Lenin monument in Kiev is not just an act of vandalism,"" party leader Petro Symonenko said, according to a post on the party's official website. ""It is a sign that organizers of the protests are not for the European values, but rather for hate, fear and destruction of the state of Ukraine."" The toppling of the statue on Sunday came as 100,000 protesters took to the streets of Kiev, according to police estimates, piling more pressure on Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych after he turned away from integration with Europe. Kiev suspended talks with the European Union last month, angering many Ukrainians who say an EU agreement would have opened borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion. The subsequent protests that have rattled the eastern European country are the biggest in Ukraine since the so-called Orange Revolution nine years ago, a populist movement that toppled the government. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called Yanukovych on Sunday and told the Ukrainian president that he had ""grave concern"" about the situation, urging authorities not to resort to violence. Yanukovych told the U.N. chief that ""consultations would be initiated to defuse the situation,"" the United Nations said. Opposition leaders, who failed to force the government's resignation in a vote of no confidence in parliament last week, are counting on their supporters to voice their discontent. Demonstrators flocked to the capital's Independence Square, many camping out in freezing weather as they demanded the government's ouster as well as early presidential and parliamentary elections. Russia calls for 'stability and order' Others rallied outside the cabinet office, the presidential office and other government offices -- in some cases blocking the buildings and preventing employees from working. Tens of thousands of anti-government activists met at noon in Kiev for a rally organizers hailed as the ""1 Million March,"" hoping it would swell to 1 million people as the day went on. Ukrainian opposition leaders said close to half a million people were out on the streets. Police put the figure at 100,000. The crowd waved Ukrainian and EU flags and chanted slogans such as ""Ukraine is Europe."" Some held pictures of Yanukovych's jailed chief political opponent, Yulia Tymoshenko. In statements posted on her official website, Tymoshenko called on supporters to keep up their demands. ""I believe that you are strong, inspired and not retreat,"" wrote the former prime minister, who ended a 12-day hunger strike last week, according to the  Batkivschyna opposition party. ""Be prepared for the fact that the struggle will be long and difficult, instant victory impossible. But professional and well-planned, your joint struggle has a chance to finish the victory."" Opposition demands . Demonstrators held a similar rally December 1. The daily protests have mainly been peaceful, but there has also been some violence, drawing condemnation from Western governments. The crowds often swell in size in the evenings as people leave work and join the protests. In speeches at the rallies, protest leaders have called for the government's resignation, the release of protesters arrested during clashes in Kiev, and the punishment of those responsible for using violence against demonstrators. ""I appeal to the whole Ukraine, its East and West. The whole Ukraine must rise and declare a strike to this power in all cities and towns from tomorrow,"" said boxer Vitaly Klitschko, an opposition leader, in a statement on the website of the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform party. Opinion: Why Ukraine's future lies with the EU, not Russia . Ukraine, Russian presidents meet . Against the backdrop of the anti-government protests, Yanukovych met Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday. The Ukrainian President traveled to China last week and had a work meeting with his Russian counterpart on the way back. ""The two Presidents discussed current bilateral relations and preparations for the upcoming meeting of the Russian-Ukrainian Interstate Commission in Moscow,"" an official statement from Putin's office said. One of the main reasons for Yanukovych's decision to backpedal on the EU talks is Russia's threat of trade sanctions and gas bill hikes. Yanukovych was also under pressure by the EU to free Tymoshenko. The Orange Revolution that swept him from office in 2004, when he was prime minister, also swept Tymoshenko to power. Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2011 after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with Russia in 2009. The United States and Europe see the punishment as politically motivated.

"Forty years after the grisly execution-style murder of a New Jersey state trooper, the woman convicted of his killing has been  placed on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list -- the first woman to be named on it. Authorities say Joanne Chesimard, 65, has been living freely in Cuba since 1984, five years after she escaped from a U.S. prison. ""She attends government functions and her standard of living is higher than most Cubans,"" the FBI said in a statement. Chesimard, now known as ""Assata Shakur,"" is wanted in the killing of Trooper Werner Foerster on the New Jersey Turnpike on May 2, 1973, the FBI  said. Rewards of $2 million -- $1 million from the FBI and $1 million from the state of New Jersey -- have been offered for information leading to her capture and return. Chesimard is the 46th terrorist added to list since its inception in 2001, and the second domestic terrorist put on the list. According to the FBI, Chesimard, Clark Squire, and James Coston were stopped for a motor vehicle violation on the New Jersey Turnpike by two state troopers.  Police say Chesimard fired the first shot at the troopers, and Coston shot from the back seat. Trooper James Harper was shot in the shoulder before fatally wounding Coston.  During the gun fight, Foerster was executed at point blank range with his own gun, according to the FBI. Chesimard and Squire were tried and convicted of the murder, and were serving time in 1979 when Chesimard escaped from prison ""with help from a coalition of radical, domestic terror groups who took two guards hostage during an armed assault at the facility where she was being lodged,"" the FBI statement said. Chesimard was a member of the Black Panther Party and later the Black Liberation Army, ""described as one of the most violent militant organizations of 1970s,"" the FBI said. ""The Black Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the murder of several police officers throughout the United States,"" the FBI said in a statement. Aaron T. Ford, special agent in charge of the FBI's Newark Division, told reporters Thursday Chesimard ""remains an inspiration to the movement"" despite living abroad, and he called her a ""threat to America."" According to the website AssataShakur.org, Chesimard says she was forced to ""flee from the political repression, racism and violence that dominate the U.S. government's policy towards people of color."" Musician Common penned ""A Song for Assata"" in 2000 on his album ""Like Water for Chocolate."" ""In the spirit of the Black Panthers, in the spirit of Assata Shakur, we make this movement towards freedom, for all those who have been oppressed, and all those in the struggle,"" he sings.","Chesimard was convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper in 1973 .

"Pakistan's army said it killed an al Qaeda operative who grew up in the United States and was on the FBI's list of most wanted terrorists. Adnan G. El Shukrijumah, 39, was once indicted for his alleged role in a terror plot to attack targets there and in the UK. He was killed in a raid in South Waziristan on Saturday, Pakistani army spokesman Asim Bajwal said on Twitter. Shukrijumah, a senior commander, is thought to have served as one of the leaders of al Qaeda's external operations program, according to the FBI, hatching plots to attack the West. He was indicted by New York authorities in 2010 over an alleged plot to have two men blow themselves up in the city's subway system. The State Department's Rewards for Justice program had offered $5 million for information leading to his capture. Lived in NYC, Florida . Shukrijumah was born in Saudi Arabia, the eldest son of a Saudi Imam, and came to America as a young child. His family settled in Brooklyn, New York, where his father preached at a mosque. They lived at a nearby house before moving to Florida in the mid-'90s. His father, who is now dead, opened a small mosque near Fort Lauderdale. Shukrijumah worked at odd jobs, including selling used cars, and took classes in information technology and chemistry at a small college in South Florida. He also took classes to improve his English. Then he disappeared. The FBI says that after he left America, Shukrijumah started off as an al Qaeda dishwasher, doing menial tasks at training camps. But he rose in the ranks to a key leadership position. An FBI counter-terrorism agent linked Shukrijumah to the thwarted New York subway suicide mission in fall of 2009 in the biggest post-9/11 terror investigation. Two men admitted they planned to blow themselves up using homemade bombs. Prosecutors say it was Shukrijumah who called the shots at the time -- probably from somewhere along the Afghan-Pakistan border. Key al Qaeda figure possibly killed in Pakistan .","Adnan G.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A Palestinian man plowed a stolen vehicle into a Tel Aviv police checkpoint and then stabbed several people early Monday morning, Israeli police said. Seven people were injured in the attack, including one critically, officials said. The man, in his 20s and from Nablus in the West Bank, stole a taxi in Tel Aviv and drove it to a checkpoint near a popular nightclub that was hosting a large party, said Israeli police spokeswoman Luba Samri. After crashing the car, he got out with a knife in hand, police said. He stabbed several passersby before he was apprehended, Samri said. Four police officers and three civilians were wounded in the attack, she said. Israeli Police Commissioner Yohanan Danino said the man had planned the attack in advance. ""Tonight's event gives us additional proof that that terrorists are still motivated to carry out attacks,"" Danino told reporters. ""There was a big event being celebrated tonight with many partygoers. The Israel Border Police deployment was exceptional and prevented a great tragedy. The terrorist attack ended with a relatively light outcome."" Meanwhile, the Israeli military said it had reinforced its military presence on the southern border, south of Gaza, due to ""ongoing terror alerts."" The new Israeli security concerns follow an attack earlier this month in which a group of heavily armed gunmen attacked a series of Israeli civilian and military targets in southern Israel near the border with Egypt. Eight Israelis were killed in those attacks and the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held Gaza-based militants responsible and initiated retaliatory airstrikes. Since then, Palestinian militant groups have fired dozens of rockets and mortars into southern Israel and Israel has responded with punitive airstrikes. Nearly two dozen Palestinians and an Israeli have been killed in the violence, with scores injured on both sides.","NEW: Israel beefs up military presence on the southern border .

"Manila's international airport is on high alert after authorities foiled an alleged bomb plot Monday, state-run media in the Philippines report. Counter-terror agents acting on a tip interrupted a group of men allegedly assembling improvised explosive devices in a white truck parked outside a terminal at Ninoy Aquino International Airport, said the Philippines News Agency, or PNA. The agency initially said four suspects had been arrested but later revised the number of arrests to three. The white truck had been parked outside terminal three of the airport when it was intercepted about 1:45 a.m. local time (1:45 p.m. Sunday ET), PNA said. The agents from the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation also seized firearms from the men, it said. The names of the suspects have not yet been released, and investigators are trying to establish who was behind the alleged plot and their motive. The investigation is continuing. Rebel groups in the Philippines have been fighting to establish an independent Muslim homeland in the south of the predominantly Christian country.","Manila's international airport is on high alert after an alleged bomb plot is foiled .

"India has an unlikely new public health hero: a giant, anthropomorphic stool that chases people to squat in toilets. Mr Poo, who appears in commercials accompanied by a groovy techno anthem, is the face of the latest public health campaign by United Nations Children's Fund in the country. With a bold and quirky approach unlike any previous awareness drives, the 'Poo2Loo' campaign seeks to bring people's attention to the health hazards associated with public defecation -- a deep-rooted social norm in the country's rural and urban slums . According to UNICEF, India has the highest number of people in the world -- an estimated 620 million -- who defecate in the open, creating a major public health hazard by leaving an estimated 65 million kilograms of waste each day. Only half of the population uses toilets. With an animated video, a catchy song with 'toilet sounds', and even a smartphone application, the digitally-led campaign is targeted at the country's youth. The campaign uses ""quirky, informative and inspiring language,"" said UNICEF spokeswoman Maria Fernandez. ""It also contains humour to better connect with the target audience. Once they [the youth] are exposed to the issue...they will be encouraged to know more."" Poo woes . The approach might be humorous, but the underlying issue isn't. Open defecation is almost universal amongst the poorest 20 percent of India's population. An absence of adequate toilets and water facilities is as much the reason for this as is a lack of awareness about proper sanitation and hygiene. The number of toilets in the country is far below what is required, but even when community toilets are provided, many people in rural India continue to defecate in the open due to a lack of education about proper hygiene. Projects such as the Total Sanitation Campaign -- a community-led program launched in 1999 to address the country's sanitation woes -- have boosted toilet facilities, but hundreds of millions of people remain without access to toilets. There is also  a huge discrepancy between the government's data on the number of toilets built and what some reports claim. The Union Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation claims that more than 50 percent of the country's rural households were covered by the sanitation drive by 2010, while the last Census conducted in 2011 showed toilet coverage to be only around 30 percent. Children most at risk . This is of particular concern for children in the country's rural pockets. Reports say poor sanitation is one of the major contributors to India's rampant child malnutrition numbers -- among the highest in the world. UNICEF's figures show why. More than 28 million children lack access to toilets in their schools. They also face a huge risk of contracting bacterial infections, with over 44 percent of mothers disposing their children's waste in the open. Diarrhoea remains one of the top causes of child deaths in the country, alongside respiratory infections. The issue of poor sanitation has also been raised by politicians as a priority for the next government. ""Whoever the prime minister is must lead a national movement to make the country open defecation-free in 10 years' time,"" Union Minister Jairam Ramesh told reporters in March. The goal seems somewhat ambitious. While there has been a 20 percent drop in the number of people defecating in the open in the last decade, India has a long way to go before it can meet the 2015 Millennium Development Goal target for sanitation, which requires 75% of the country to have access to sanitation. India set itself the even loftier target of providing 100% of the rural population with access to toilet facilities by 2012, but that didn't materialize. In fact, the date keeps getting pushed further -- it was initially revised to 2015 and recently set back to 2022. Using social media, UNICEF is trying to steer people's attention towards this largely taboo issue. However, questions remain about the impact of such an urban campaign, given that its target audience -- youngsters -- are mostly likely to be using toilets in any case. To which, Maria contends, ""If we keep silence, we are contributing to the problem. So the campaign tries to create noise so those who have actually toilets understand the issue and do something about it.""

"Last week's presidential election should be a wake-up call to the Republican Party -- we cannot afford to ignore a rising generation of 21st-century Americans. Going into the 2012 election, I worried that without effectively connecting with the youth vote, the GOP risked losing the millennial generation for the rest of their lives. On November 6, we may have sealed our fate. That's because partisan self-identification forms in new generations like cement -- setting softly and hardening over time. After three presidential elections cycles of voting for the Democratic candidate, there's a danger that millennials will vote blue from here on out. They broke for John Kerry in 2004 by 9 percentage points, for President  Barack Obama in 2008 by 34 percentage points, and again in 2012, by a lesser 23 percentage points. Republicans can take cold comfort in the fact that the surge in millennial support for Obama that Democrats had hoped for in 2012 didn't turn up. The Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement estimates that about as many millennials voted in this election as the last one -- even though a whole new cohort of 18-plus voters became eligible. Opinion: My generation showed up . As GOP pollster and millennial maven Kristen Soltis points out, ""Young people are open to hearing a new message and new solutions. And they are frustrated. They didn't turn out in higher numbers for Barack Obama this election than they did four years ago. But they have not warmed to the Republican Party. We have not made the connection for why conservative principles are better for their future."" But there's a silver lining, according to Soltis: Mitt Romney improved with millennials more than any other age group over John McCain's performance -- no other age group had such a dramatic swing. The problem, she acknowledges, is that it's still not enough. Obama beat the GOP among youth by 4 more points than Clinton and Reagan won youth in their re-elections, each capturing the youth vote by 19 percentage points. For a generation whose enthusiasm has waned, winning the youth vote by 23 percentage points is still historic in modern American politics. David Burstein, filmmaker and author of the forthcoming book on millennials, ""Fast Future: How the Millennial Generation Is Shaping Our World,"" tells me that ""with sustained increased youth participation in 2004, 2008 and now 2012, it's impossible to say that young people don't show up to vote. We've proved our political muscle. Politicians have been able to get away with paying little attention to issues facing young Americans by invoking the argument that we don't vote. Now, they have no excuse not to address our concerns. ... Millennials take participating in politics seriously and see it as a real responsibility."" Where are all the millennial feminists? That's why I'm stubbornly optimistic as I look to the future. My Republican Party has no choice but to reach out to millennials. And when Republicans sift through the exit polls, we will have to confront our demographic deficit with Latinos, single women, non-churchgoers and centrist voters. But here's the hidden good news -- if Republicans aggressively reach out to millennials, they will find that they can begin to address all their problems in one fell swoop.  Because the character of the millennial generation embodies the demographic challenges facing the GOP. The millennials are the most diverse, least traditional, least partisan generation alive today. They are 40% nonwhite, and Hispanics are the largest minority population within the age cohort. By supporting the Dream Act, which allows a pathway to citizenship for millennials who are in the United States without authorization through no fault of their own, we reach out to both millennials and Hispanics. Only one quarter identify with organized religion, and they adhere least to traditional family structures. Being the political party perceived as obsessed with limiting the rights of their gay friends is not a winning formula. Millennials are concerned with national debt and the deficits. The message that previous administrations' reckless spending -- Republicans and Democrats alike -- has amounted to ""generational theft"" that is compromising the millennial generation's fiscal future can resonate. I had hoped that vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan would make it his mission to tour college campuses making an explicit generational appeal to millennials. This could be a winning issue for Republicans to help bridge the divide, and while Ryan did visit some universities, a consistent drumbeat by the Romney-Ryan ticket to compete for the youth vote did not occur. It was a lost opportunity. It's not just about social issues. Even if the GOP were to embrace freedom to marry as being consistent with advancing individual freedom (something I'd love to see), we would not suddenly win over millennials. We need to make a compelling case for why conservatism can connect with this rising generation, explaining that our fiscal policies in particular will help build a more prosperous and less debt-ridden future for them and the country we all love. There's still time. The 2020 election will be the first presidential race where all millennials will be of voting age -- with 90 million eligible voters (as opposed to this year's 64 million). We may have failed to connect with this first wave of millennials, but there's no excuse to miss the chance to connect with this rising generation now. The GOP can make itself competitive without compromising our core principles of individual freedom, fiscal responsibility, free markets and a strong national defense. We might have missed our chance in 2012, but if we start now, the party, and the country will be better for it. A millennial says: Stop trashing us!","GOP consultant Margaret Hoover says her party missed the boat in 2012 with millennials .

"Texas Gov. Rick Perry suspended his struggling presidential campaign Thursday and threw his support to Newt Gingrich, a development that could alter the dynamics of the Republican race just two days before the tightening South Carolina primary. ""I believe Newt is a conservative visionary who can transform our country. We've had our differences, which campaigns will inevitably have, and Newt is not perfect, but who among us is?"" Perry said at a press conference in Charleston, South Carolina. Perry said ""there is no viable path forward for me in this 2012 campaign."" ""I have no question that Newt Gingrich has the heart of a conservative reformer, the ability to rally and captivate the conservative movement. The courage to tell those Washington interests to take a hike if that's what's in the best interest of our country,"" Perry said. Shortly after Perry's speech, the former House speaker released a statement on the endorsement. ""I am humbled and honored to have the support of my friend Rick Perry. His selflessness is yet another demonstration of his deep sense of citizenship and commitment to the cause of limited government, historic American values and greater freedom for every American,"" Gingrich said. One source close to the Perry campaign said Perry made the final decision Wednesday night and spoke with Gingrich on the phone shortly before he held the press conference Thursday morning. ""He believes we need a conservative for president and Mitt Romney is not conservative,"" the source said. Speaking to reporters Thursday after the announcement, Perry's spokesman Ray Sullivan said the governor will return to Austin and remain there through the weekend. While there are no plans for Perry to campaign for Gingrich at this time, he said those plans will be re-evaluated after Saturday's South Carolina primary. Asked if Perry's wife, Anita, agreed with the governor's decision, Sullivan said the family is all ""supportive."" The move comes two days before the South Carolina primary and hours before the final debate ahead of the voting, which will take place on CNN Thursday night. The campaigns of Gingrich and Rick Santorum reached out to the Perry campaign Thursday morning in an ""aggressive effort"" to get his endorsement, according to a source close to Perry. Perry placed fifth in Iowa and last in New Hampshire -- a state in which he did not actively compete -- and had said he would launch a bid to win in South Carolina. ""South Carolinians are looking for a conservative candidate that will get this country back working again and I am it,"" Perry told CNN last week. On Wednesday, CNN asked Perry about a poll that showed him with only 6% support among likely voters in the South Carolina primary.  He insisted he was continuing with the effort to have a strong showing in the state. ""We're convinced that that's our goal, so the idea that we're going to do anything else, other than try to impact this election is -- that's why we got in it. We didn't get in it because it was our purpose in life to be the president of the United States. We did it because it was our purpose to serve this country, and that's what we've been called for, and that's what we're going to continue doing."" When Perry entered the race in August, he immediately did well in the polls. But a series of gaffes, particularly at debates against his rivals, sent his support plummeting. On Thursday, his campaign website continued to say ""help Rick Perry win South Carolina and get America back on track."" Perry's official campaign Facebook page was filled with posts, largely from disappointed voters.","Perry  endorses  Gingrich, says he has heart of ""conservative reformer""

Abousamra, who holds dual U.S. and Syrian citizenship, is wanted by the FBI on terrorism charges issued in 2009. They include providing material support to terrorists. There's a $50,000 reward for his capture. According to the FBI, Abousamra repeatedly traveled to Pakistan and Yemen seeking ""military training for the purpose of killing American soldiers overseas."" He returned to the United States but left after FBI terrorism investigators questioned him. He was last believed to be living in Syria, according to the FBI. According to ABC, Abousamra grew up in Boston. His father was a doctor, and he went to a private Catholic high school and a public school before attending Northeastern University, where he made the dean's list, according to ABC, which cited school officials. Showing off its crimes: How ISIS flaunts its brutality as propaganda . ISIS appears to have a well-funded, well-organized social media and video production effort. Its videos are slickly produced, with high production values, experts say. And ISIS imagery has proven tough to stamp out. Twitter lagged behind ISIS on efforts to remove images of the decapitation of U.S. journalists, CNN national security analyst Fran Townsend noted. ""We've seen propaganda campaigns from al Qaeda before, but nothing that acts that quickly in real-time events that's able to target tactically, and that's a real concern to American officials,"" she said. Juliette Kayyem, also a CNN national security analyst, said social media is helping ISIS, which also calls itself the Islamic State, amplify its message. ""They are a serious threat, and they are using social media to make themselves even bigger in that regard,"" she said. Social media battle augments Iraq bloodshed .

"Peruvian judges on Friday sentenced Dutch national Joran van der Sloot to 28 years in prison and ordered him to pay thousands of dollars in reparations for the killing of a 21-year-old Peruvian woman in 2010. Van der Sloot, who was visibly upset after the decision was issued, admitted this week to killing Stephany Flores in his Lima hotel room. The judges said they took his confession into account, but they still gave him a sentence two years short of the 30-year maximum. With time served, it means van der Sloot is scheduled to be released June 10, 2038. The defendant, 24, stood for much of the more than two-hour session and perspired through his green t-shirt. He drank three cups of water and frequently wiped his face. The judges ordered van der Sloot expelled from Peru at the end of his sentence and ordered him to pay 200,000 Peruvian new soles, or about $74,500, in reparations to Flores' closest relatives. Van der Sloot confessed to robbery in addition to murder, admitting that he stole Flores' belongings, including 850 soles (more than $300), credit cards, and the victim's van as a means to leave the country. He fled to Chile and was arrested a few days later. It was an apparent attempt to win a more lenient sentence, using a plea called an ""anticipated conclusion of the process"" under Peruvian law. Five days earlier, the three judges delayed the start of van der Sloot's trial after he declined to give a plea after expressing reservations about the ""aggravating factors"" tied to admitting his guilt. Van der Sloot's attorney, Jose Luis Jimenez, pressed earlier this week for a shorter sentence. Jimenez claimed that his client was under special stress the day the 2010 murder occurred, which marked five years after Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway went missing in Aruba. Van der Sloot -- who, with two others, was among the last people seen with Holloway - was detained twice, but never charged, in the high-profile international case. ""He was pointed at and persecuted. The world had been against him for five years before this case, for a murder he said he never committed and for which there is no evidence whatsoever,"" said Jimenez. Investigators have said they believe van der Sloot killed Flores after she found something related to the Holloway case on his computer while visiting him in his hotel room. The two met while van der Sloot was in town for a poker tournament. Judges on Friday recounted the crime in detail. They described how Flores hit van der Sloot in the face after reading the item on Holloway, leading him to hit her in the face with his elbow. Flores fainted and van der Sloot tried to strangle her, but she was still breathing and so he suffocated her with his shirt. Van der Sloot then tried to clean the room by removing the sheets and changing his bloodied shirt, they said. He was ultimately caught while traveling alone in a taxi near the Chilean central coastal city of Vina del Mar. Holloway's body has never been found, and no one has been charged in relation to the case in Aruba. But van der Sloot does face possible extradition to the United States in a related matter. In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him on charges of wire fraud and extortion after allegations surfaced that he tried to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother, Beth. Van der Sloot offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of Holloway's remains in exchange for the money, according to the indictment. He was allegedly given a total of $25,000, and authorities believe he used that money to travel to Peru for the poker tournament. Thursday, about six and a half years after Holloway went missing, Alabama Probate Judge Alan King signed an order declaring the teenager legally dead.","With time served, Joran van der Sloot will be released in 2038 .

"Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter, the middleweight boxing contender who spent 19 years in prison after being wrongly convicted of a triple murder, has died in Toronto, according to Win Wahrer, the director of client services for the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted. Carter, 76, died of complications from prostate cancer, Wahrer said. ""I always remember spending hours and hours with Rubin talking about the wrongful convictions,"" she told CNN. ""He was a great mentor and teacher. I felt very fortunate to have those times with him. ... He lived a very full life."" Carter spent 19 years in prison for a triple killing in New Jersey before a federal judge ruled in 1985 that he and John Artis, who was with Carter on the night of the shootings, did not receive fair trials and released them. Artis was with Carter when he died early Sunday morning, Wahrer said, adding that Carter had lived in Toronto since his release from prison. Carter told CNN three years ago that prison allowed him to do two things: shed the illusions and anger that spurred his youthful delinquency, and come to the realization that his destiny might lie in fighting for justice. He was a title-seeking prizefighter no more. But first, he had to scrap his way out of prison. ""Hatred and bitterness and anger only consume the vessel that contains them. It doesn't hurt another soul,"" Carter told CNN. ""If I were to allow myself to continue to feel that anger and the bitterness of being a victim, I would have never survived prison itself. Prison can deal with anger; prison can deal with hatred because prison is about all those things. So I had to overcome those things."" Carter became an activist for the wrongly convicted after his release and was the first executive director of the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted from 1993 to 2004. ""Rubin will be remembered by those at AIDWYC who were fortunate enough to have worked with him as a truly courageous man who fought tirelessly to free others who had suffered the same fate as he,"" the group said in a statement. ""We will continue to fight against wrongful convictions, a battle that Rubin valiantly fought until the day he died.  Rest in peace Rubin, your battle is over but you will never be forgotten."" There was a time when boxing enthusiasts were giddy about Carter's future. He was fast and powerful, hence his sobriquet, and despite being short for his weight class (5-foot-8), he became a Madison Square Garden and television fixture. Ring magazine declared him one of the top middleweight contenders in 1963 after he knocked out 11 of his first 15 professional opponents. ""His shaven head, prominent mustache, unwavering stare and solid frame made him an intimidating presence in the ring decades before such a look became commonplace,"" according to the New Jersey Boxing Hall of Fame. Following a loss in his only title bout in 1964, Carter precipitously fell from grace, losing seven of his 15 final matches before being fingered in a 1966 triple homicide at the LaFayette Bar and Grill. He was convicted and sentenced to three life terms the following year. The ruling was later overturned, but Carter was convicted again in 1976, a year after Bob Dylan co-wrote a song declaring his innocence. That conviction, too, was tossed out, and Carter walked out of prison in 1985. In 1988, a Passaic County prosecutor filed a motion to dismiss the charges. By that time, Carter was a cause celebre. In addition to the Dylan tune, his case had drawn the attention of a heavyweight counterpart, Muhammad Ali, and actor Burt Reynolds, among others. His plight has also inspired at least a half dozen books, including his own autobiography, written from prison. A major motion picture that opened years after Carter's release would earn actor Denzel Washington his fourth Oscar nomination. ""God bless Rubin Carter and his tireless fight to ensure justice for all,"" Washington said Sunday. The 1999 film played a key role in introducing Carter to an audience that had not followed his two-decade legal saga, but the ex-boxer said Washington, in a way, also introduced him to himself. In his 2011 book, ""Eye of the Hurricane: My Path from Darkness to Freedom,"" Carter explained that he was not perfect and conceded guilt to a host of regrettable crimes including assaults and robberies -- but not murder. Those crimes, he said, were perpetrated when he was blind, operating unconsciously -- a recurring theme in his book -- and they were the product of the anger to which he succumbed growing up under Jim Crow, he said.

"Since 1941, comic book fans have followed the exploits of teenaged Archie Andrews and his friends. This July, they'll find out how he dies. ""Life With Archie"" #36 hits stores on July 16, and CNN can reveal exclusively that it tells the story of how Archie sacrifices himself to save a friend. Few details are known, but it seems fitting that Archie would go out a hero. The 37th issue one week later will end the series. The ""Life With Archie"" series has been telling the stories of possible future Archie scenarios for the past few years, and so Archie will continue to be alive in the comics set in the present day. CNN spoke with Archie Comics CEO Jon Goldwater (son of Archie creator John Goldwater) about the upcoming issues. CNN: Can you explain the ""Life With Archie"" series for the uninitiated? Goldwater: ""Life With Archie"" is Archie's future -- it gives readers a look into what his life would be like after high school and college, which has never really been explored. Most fans are familiar with Archie as a high schooler, hanging out at Pop's Chocklit Shop with his friends. ""Life With Archie"" shows what happens when Archie becomes an adult and starts dealing with grownup issues. Each issue is normally split into two storylines -- one telling a tale of Archie married to Veronica another with him ending up with Betty. The final issue, however, will show readers Archie's final fate in both timelines -- and they're the same. CNN: Why kill Archie? Goldwater: I think it's the natural conclusion to the ""Life With Archie"" series. Archie dies as he lived -- heroically. He dies saving the life of a friend, and does it in his usual selfless way. Archie has always been a representation of us -- the best of us. Our strengths and our faults. Writer Paul Kupperberg, with input from myself, has crafted an emotional, impactful and classic story that I know will survive the test of time. This isn't a random one-off or ""what-if"" story that we're doing as a gag. This is the story that we mapped out carefully and with much thought. This is the death of Archie as we see it, and we're treating it with that same level of gravitas and import. It's a once-in-a-lifetime event, and we are being very considerate about it. CNN: What are you hoping to accomplish with this storyline? Goldwater: First and foremost, like with anything we do at Archie, we want to tell a great, memorable story. That being said, this story in particular is of the utmost importance to us as a company and as a keeper of the Archie brand. We want to not only show how Archie's life ends, but also what he means to the world around him. We want to celebrate his life. After the events of ""Life With Archie"" #36, fans will leap forward a year to see the aftermath, and how his friends have moved on since his surprising death. What's Jughead doing? How are Betty and Veronica dealing with the loss? It's not about the attention-grab of the death but about telling a great, evocative story that reminds people why this character is important to the fabric of pop culture -- and showing how heroic a normal guy like Archie can be, and how important it is to realize that. This isn't a story we're going to retcon a few weeks from now. This happened. This is the conclusion to the ""Life With Archie"" story and timeline, and it will allow us as a company and the world to take a moment to look at Archie's life as a whole and recognize him as one of the most important characters -- not in just comics -- but in popular culture. We want people to feel the same emotional roller coaster we felt putting this story together -- to feel the range of emotions, from happiness, sadness, anger, joy and pride. We want people to react to this in a strong way because Archie is so important to them. CNN: How do you hope fans will react ultimately? Goldwater: We expect some level of shock, outrage and surprise -- followed by understanding. As a company, we are not afraid to take risks. We're not scared to shake things up to draw attention to the great stories we're building here at Archie. I hope fans will be intrigued by this news, pick up the issues in July and realize they've been given one of the best comics on the stands. They'll be handed a piece of comic book history, featuring some of the most well-known characters in the world saying goodbye to an icon. We want fans to talk about this for years to come. We think this story is bigger than anything we've ever done -- it's bold, dramatic and best of all, a fitting end to the life of Archie. CNN: What do you think Archie Comics has been doing by shaking things up over the recent years? Archie: We're a sleeping giant. Years ago, before I stepped in as CEO, Archie was seen as a dormant, nostalgia brand stuck in amber. We were in suspended animation. People thought the stories were still set in the '50s! Now, while the characters -- like Betty, Archie, Veronica, Jughead and Reggie -- are at their core the same, Riverdale has changed. It's caught up with the times. The town of Riverdale you read about now is like any other in America. It's diverse, it's not problem-free, and it represents America in an honest way. Archie is about being welcoming, diverse and entertaining. We've managed to strike that balance in our storytelling for the last five years and managed to not only get attention, but keep people entertained. From the introduction of Kevin Keller, the first regular gay character in comics to now, the death of Archie, we've not been afraid to take risks. The big thing is, though, our risks pay off because the stories, art and execution are spot-on. We back up what we say. CNN: What will be the long-term impact of this story? Goldwater: Well, this is the end. This is how Archie dies in the pages of ""Life With Archie."" We will not be retconning, reversing or backtracking on this story in terms of ""Life With Archie."" The main Archie line, however, telling stories of Archie in high school, will continue. ""Afterlife With Archie"" [the ""Archie"" zombie series] will continue, and we will keep on taking risks with different and new interpretations of our characters. But as far as we see it, this is how Archie dies. That's how we approached this story and how we're treating it.","Archie Andrews will die in upcoming issue of ""Life With Archie""

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's mother filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing AEG Live of causing her son's death by pushing him to rehearse for his comeback concerts despite poor health. Katherine Jackson's suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, claimed that the concert production company controlled Jackson's health because it hired and directed Dr. Conrad Murray. Murray faces trial on an involuntary manslaughter charge for administering drugs to the pop star that the coroner ruled caused Jackson's death in June 25, 2009. The suit claims that Murray was ""selected by, hired by, and controlled by AEG,"" a worldwide concert promotion and production company. Jackson signed a contract in January 2009 with AEG Live for a series of comeback concerts in London that would begin in July 2009. ""Indeed, AEG demanded and required that Michael Jackson be treated by this particular doctor to ensure that Michael Jackson would attend all rehearsals and shows on the tour,"" the suit said. The lawsuit contends that the concert production company had a legal responsibility to ""treat him safely and to not put him in harms' way."" ""AEG, despite its knowledge of Michael Jackson's physical condition, breached those duties by putting its desire for massive profits from the tour over the health and safety of Michael Jackson,"" it said. The company failed to provide Murray with cardio-pulmonary resuscitation equipment and a nurse as was promised in his employment contract, the suit said. Marvin S. Putnam, a partner in the law firm representing AEG, said Jackson's suit ""is inaccurate, unsubstantiated and meritless."" ""Dr. Murray was Mr.  Jackson's longtime personal physician,"" Putnam said in a statement. ""AEG did not choose him, hire him or  supervise him.  That said, and in honor of our professional relationship with  Mr. Jackson and his Estate, we will have no further public  statements."" The autopsy report on Jackson's death noted the lack of medical equipment in the Los Angeles home where Murray administered a powerful anesthetic to help Jackson sleep during several nights before his death. The lawsuit outlines the last week of Jackson's life, which it said included a visited to his home by AEG CEO Randy Phillips on June 18, 2009. Phillips went there to meet with Jackson and Murray after the singer failed to show up for a rehearsal, it said. ""AEG threatened that if Jackson missed any further rehearsals, they were going to 'pull the plug' on the show,"" it said. ""AEG told Murray that he had to make sure Jackson got to rehearsals."" ""They said it was to be 'tough love' and that they had read Jackson the 'riot act,'"" the suit said. When Jackson finally showed up for the rehearsal at 9:30 p.m., ""he was visibly shaken,"" it said. ""Witnesses present at that rehearsal confirm that Michael Jackson was not himself that day."" Later that evening, Murray administered a ""cocktail of Valium, Ativan, Versed and Propofol in order to get him to sleep,"" the lawsuit said. ""Jackson was freezing cold"" at a rehearsal two days before his death, the suit said. ""His assistants had to give him several shirts to wear under his long heavy coat."" Jackson's shivering and disorientation continued the last day before his death, it said. ""AEG was well aware of his condition but did not postpone any rehearsals, nor did AEG relent in its demands that Jackson continue to maintain the grueling rehearsal schedule,"" the suit said. ""Rather than react reasonably and relax the rehearsal schedule so Michael Jackson could recuperate from his physical problems, AEG insisted that he attend every rehearsal in a grueling schedule, threatening that if he missed even one more, they would cancel the tour."" His mother's lawsuit described Jackson in his last months as ""confused, easily frightened, unable to remember, obsessive, and disoriented."" ""He had impaired memory, loss of appetite, dehydration, and absence of energy,"" it said. ""He was cold and shivering during the summer rehearsals for this show."" The company ""should have known that it was jeopardizing Jackson's health and safety by assuming control over the doctor-patient relationship between Jackson and Murray, and by directing and influencing Murray to act without regard to medical safety standards,"" it said. Joe Jackson, the pop star's father, is not a direct party to the lawsuit. He filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Murray this summer. .

"(CNN)Aviation website AirlineRatings.com has just released its annual list of the world's 10 safest airlines. Once again, Australian airline Qantas grabs the top spot. ""Qantas continues to lead the industry with safety innovations and its fleet is now the youngest -- 7.9 years -- it has been since the airline was privatized in 1995,"" AirlineRatings.com editor Geoffrey Thomas tells CNN. He says the airline is an industry benchmark for best practice and has taken the lead in virtually every major advancement in airline safety over the past 60 years. Rounding out the rest of the top 10 in alphabetical order are: Air New Zealand,  British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Emirates, Etihad Airways, EVA Air, Finnair, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines. ""Our top 10 safest airlines are always at the forefront of safety innovation and launching new planes,"" says Thomas. AirlineRatings.com's rating system takes into account audits from aviation's governing bodies and lead associations as well as government audits and the airlines' fatality records. It also examines airlines' operational histories, incident records and operational excellence. Of the the 449 airlines it monitors, 149 have the top seven-star safety ranking. This year, the site also included a list of the top 10 safest low cost airlines for 2015. These are, in alphabetical order:  Aer Lingus (Ireland), Alaska Airlines (U.S), Icelandair (Iceland), Jetblue (U.S.), Jetstar (Australia), Kulula.com (South Africa), Monarch Airlines (UK), Thomas Cook (UK), TUIfly (Germany) and WestJet (Canada). ""Unlike a number of low cost carriers these airlines have all passed the stringent International Air Transport Association Operational Safety Audit audit and have excellent safety records,"" says Thomas. ""Low cost does not mean low safety."" One fatal accident for every 1.3 million flights . The release of the AirlineRatings.com list comes at a particularly sensitive time for fliers. While 2013 was one of the safest years in global aviation history, 2014 is considered one of the worst in recent years in terms of fatalities, due to several high-profile air incidents. AirlineRatings.com says there were 21 fatal accidents with 986 fatalities in 2014 -- higher than the 10-year average. However, looking to the positive there were only 111 crashes in 2014, the lowest number in more than 80 years says the Geneva-based Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives, or BAAA. The last time the world had 111 crashes was in 1927. ""If you consider sheer numbers of aircraft crashes, flying today is safer,"" says Kane Ray, an analyst with the International Bureau of Aviation, a global aviation consulting group. ""However, there are more aircraft in the sky, so naturally the overall number may appear similar to previous decades and, in some categories of disaster, higher."" According to a report on AirlineRatings.com, the world's airlines carried a record 3.3 billion passengers on 27 million flights in 2014. ""Flashback 50 years and there were a staggering 87 crashes killing 1,597 when airlines carried only 141 million passengers -- 5% of today's number,"" says the website. ""Another twist is that fatal accidents for 2014 were at a record low 21 -- one for every 1.3 million flights. Two of the crashes last year -- MH370 and MH17 -- were unprecedented in modern times and claimed 537 lives."" In March, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 aboard. Officials believe that plane is somewhere in the Indian Ocean. But, nearly 10 months later, MH370 hasn't been found. In July, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 aboard. Malaysia Airlines has a five out of seven ranking on AirlineRatings.com. AirAsia Indonesia -- still reeling from the crash of Flight QZ8501, which went down over the Java Sea on December 28 with 162 people on board -- has a four out of seven star ranking. Prior to December, AirAsia had a near flawless safety record, with no previous fatal accidents. World's unsafest airlines . AirlineRatings.com says if an airline has a crash that involves the death of a passenger and/or crew members it will automatically receive a deduction of one star, giving it a lower safety rating. ""A crash involving fatalities carries with it a one star deduction for 10 years from the date of the incident,"" says the website on a page explaining its ratings system. Of the 449 airlines surveyed by AirlineRatings.com, nearly 50 have just three stars or less. Four airlines only achieved one star for safety. Two are from Nepal -- Tara Air and Nepal Airlines -- joining Kazakhstan's Scat Airlines and Afghanistan's Kam Air. All four are on a list of airlines banned from flying within the European Union. The United States doesn't blacklist individual airlines, but it does make public a list of countries it judges to fall short of international aviation safety standards.

"(CNN)America's immigration issue needs a comprehensive and permanent bipartisan legislative solution. An executive action is a temporary and limited fix. On the night President Obama announced his most recent immigration executive action, I called it a Band-Aid. Today, we found out, the Band-Aid may not stick. In a case brought by 26 states, a federal judge in Texas issued an injunction halting implementation of the President's executive actions: the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (or DAPA) -- which would have granted work permits and extended deferred deportation status and expanded the the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program for undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children. What the immigration ruling means . This is just the beginning of the legal wrangling over this. At issue is whether President Obama exceeded his powers and tried to legislate.  This is Congress' job, and the problem, to state the obvious, is that Congress is not doing it. For decades, Congress has been talking about fixing the broken immigration system. This has gone nowhere. On the other side, you have mounting pressure on President Obama from an increasingly frustrated Latino community and Democratic base. He made pie-in-the-sky campaign promises offering immigration reform in his first year in office. In his first two years, he had a Democratic Senate and Democratic House. He had the chance to act. Instead, he sat on his hands as the problem continued to fester. What's worse, as part of the fight over the immigration executive actions, the Congress is now playing a game of chicken with the Department of Homeland Security's appropriations bill, set to expire in a few days, insisting on amendments to the bill that would block Obama's immigration actions. Hill GOP emboldened after immigration ruling . Lastly, add to this equation the reality of the millions of confused undocumented families whose lives and livelihoods are in the balance, and who have no idea how this is going to end. The truth is, none of us do. Frankly, the entire thing is a hot, ugly, mess. The President should use this judge's injunction as an opportunity to invite and pressure Congress to work with him on a bipartisan solution. Halt the implementation of the immigration program. Halt the legal maneuvering. Halt the irresponsible posturing on funding DHS. Set a deadline to pass legislation. Fix the immigration problem comprehensively, permanently and fairly.","Ana Navarro: Judge's halt to Obama's executive actions on immigration reveal they were always a Band-Aid .

"(CNN)It's been one of the most memorable labels in British horse racing history but to the undoubted dismay of traditionalists, Glorious Goodwood is no more. The five days of racing will instead be known as the Qatar Goodwood Festival from 2015. Not content with staging the 2022 World Cup, or the 2019 World Athletics Championships, the Gulf State has now added its name to one of horse racing's most prestigious festivals.

The Group 1 Qatar Sussex Stakes now has a total prize fund of just over $1.5m, to strengthen its status as one of the world's most valuable mile-long races. ""I am delighted that Qatar have decided to play a significant part in Goodwood's position as one of the finest racing experiences in the world,"" said Lord March, Goodwood's owner. ""Goodwood has, for more than 200 years, been about the best racing in the most English of settings, accessible to everyone.

"(CNN) -- It was a frigid June night at Pickstone Mine in Zimbabwe when 67-year-old Angela Campbell -- soaking wet, her arm broken and a gun to her head -- signed a document vowing to give up the fight for her family's farm. Angela Campbell, 67, was beaten and kidnapped days after Zimbabwe's runoff election. The kidnappers demanding her signature at gunpoint were ""war veterans"" from President Robert Mugabe's heyday as a liberation hero, and they made it clear that her refusal would mean more beatings. Though Campbell signed the document, her son-in-law said she has no intention of giving up her battle; Campbell's family will be in Windhoek, Namibia, on Wednesday to present arguments to a Southern African Development Community tribunal. In pursuing the case, the Campbells and 77 fellow Zimbabwean farmers are risking theft, torture and death for what may be their only remaining chance to save the homes and farms so coveted by Mugabe and his loyalists. Mugabe blames the West for his nation's soaring inflation and poverty. But analysts say Mugabe's 2000 ""resettlement"" policy, in which property was snatched from white farmers and redistributed to landless blacks, is more to blame for the country's turmoil.  Watch a report from the time of the Campbell attack » . ""All I want to see is justice,"" said Richard Etheredge, 72, a white farmer who was evicted from his farm last month. ""The world cannot carry on with criminals."" On June 15, Etheredge, who has joined the case, and his family received word that a Zimbabwean senator planned to take over his Chegutu farm, a process known as ""jambanja."" ""We're going to murder you if we catch you,"" Etheredge recalls an assailant yelling from outside his son's house two days later. The senator bused ""criminals"" to his property, Etheredge said. Etheredge, his wife and one of his twin sons escaped, but the other twin and Etheredge's daughter-in-law were later beaten, he said. Looters stole his computers, farm equipment, antiques, custom gun collection and a safe with billions in Zimbabwean currency (hundreds of thousands in U.S. dollars). Etheredge said he watched the thieves abscond with his possessions in vehicles belonging to the senator. The looters also caused about $1 million in damage to his property, which includes three houses and a fruit-packing plant that was once among the most sophisticated in southern Africa. The Etheredges have been farming for 17 years and, before the attack, were producing 400,000 cartons of navel oranges and kumquats a year, he said. ""The destruction is absolutely incredible,"" Etheredge said. Mugabe's cronies visited the adjacent Mount Carmel farm about two weeks later, just days after Mugabe won a majority of votes in a runoff denounced as a ""sham"" by the international community.  Watch how violence persists after the election » . Like the Etheredges, Mike and Angela Campbell were warned that Mugabe loyalists, members of his Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, were planning to invade their farm. The government had given the 1,200-hectare (2,965-acre) tract to a Zanu-PF spokesman who also served as Mugabe's biographer, according to the Campbells' son-in-law, Ben Freeth. Two nuns went to Mount Carmel on June 26, the day before the runoff, wanting to buy sweet potatoes, Freeth said. But their quest for tubers was a ruse; they actually wanted to tell Freeth that Zanu-PF members were planning to raid the Campbell land, where the Campbells and Freeth and his wife, Laura, live. On June 29, Freeth received a phone call: ""War veterans,"" as the clans of pro-Mugabe thugs call themselves, were heading to his in-laws' house. Laura and her brother, Bruce, gathered their children. Laura fled with the children through a fence on the northern boundary of Mount Carmel farm, Freeth said. Freeth jumped in his car and sped 1½ kilometers to the Campbell house. ""These guys had already arrived, and they started shooting at me as soon as I drove through the gate,"" he said. The bullets missed, but one of the war veterans hurled a rock through the driver's side window, smashing Freeth's right eye shut. ""They dragged me out of the vehicle and began beating me over the head with rifle butts,"" Freeth said. The men tied up Freeth, he said, and took him to where his in-laws were lying bound on the gravel outside their home. Angela Campbell was still conscious. The men had caught her on her way to feed a calf. They had beaten her and broken her upper arm in two places, Freeth said. Mike Campbell was in bad shape, ""just groaning on the ground; in fact, he remembers nothing."" The heavily armed men threw the three in the back of Mike Campbell's Toyota Prado truck, and ""the next nine hours were quite a nightmare,"" Freeth said. Freeth and the Campbells were driven about 50 kilometers (31 miles) to Pickstone Mine. Their captors stopped at a dairy farm on the way and killed a white farmer's dogs, Freeth said. Night had fallen by the time they arrived at the mine to find about 60 men in Zanu-PF regalia waiting for them. ""They were pointing guns at us the whole time, telling us they were going to kill us,"" Freeth said. Freeth and the Campbells were doused with cold water and left ""shivering in the dust on the ground,"" Freeth said. They received more beatings, and Freeth said one of their captors thrashed the bottom of his feet with a shambock, a whip made of hippopotamus hide. It was during this time that their captors made Angela sign a document promising to drop the case scheduled this week before the tribunal. Mike Campbell moved in and out of consciousness, as Ben and Angela prayed -- not for their lives, but for their captors. Freeth said he had never understood Luke 6:28 -- ""Bless those who curse you"" -- until that moment, and a ""supernatural"" peace came over him. Freeth told God, ""If I'm going to be with you today, then I'm ready."" It was almost midnight when Freeth and the Campbells -- still bound -- were tossed in the back of the Prado. They bounced around the sport-utility vehicle as their captors drove 30 kilometers down a craggy dirt road to Kadoma, where they were dumped in the streets. ""I managed to walk toward a light and knocked on the door of a house and used the phone to phone my wife,"" Freeth said. The Campbells were released from the hospital last week. Both remain weak and still bear considerable scrapes and bruises. Angela has a pin in her arm. Mike, 75, suffered four broken ribs, a broken collarbone and a dislocated finger. Mike is recovering just enough to sit up, and ""he can walk a few paces,"" Freeth said Monday, complaining that his hands were ""still tingly"" from being bound so tightly. The hospital released Freeth at the weekend after neurosurgeons had to drill a 4-centimeter (1½-inch) hole in his skull to relieve pressure from a hematoma stemming from the rock and rifle-butt blows to the head. One thing not battered is the farmers' resolve to remain on the land that the Campbells have owned for 34 years. ""We intend to be there on Wednesday, and we just hope for an outcome that is good for everyone, an outcome for justice,"" Freeth said of the hearing, which is slated to last through Friday. Freeth said he believes that the tribunal will carry more clout with Mugabe than do Western nations and the African and European unions. Many of its member nations are led by Mugabe's contemporaries, and Mugabe is aware that his status as an African hero is waning, he said. ""I think it means a lot to him whether SADC is going to isolate him or continue to support him,"" Freeth said. ""Once we get to the SADC tribunal and we get a judgment and it's basically binding in black and white, it's going to be difficult for Mugabe to say, 'We're abiding by our own law.' It's going to be very difficult for him to defend what he's doing.""","Farmers kidnapped, beaten days after election for challenging land confiscation .

"(CNN) -- Maddy Schaffrick has a lot on her mind for a 15-year-old. Along with schoolwork and friends, she's also got a good shot at making the U.S. Olympic snowboarding team. Ranked among the world's Top 10 female snowboarders, Schaffrick's unique talents include riding up the steep walls of snow-covered ""halfpipes"" and vaulting herself off the edge and high into the air. Being airborne with a board under your feet, she says, ""feels like nothing can touch you."" But a deadly H1N1 flu pandemic has added a new kind of hurdle for Schaffrick and other Olympic hopefuls, as athletes and authorities hope for the best while preparing for the worst. ""If I do get the flu, it could really affect my asthma and then affect my performance and I wouldn't want that to happen."" The prospect of potential virus carriers converging on Vancouver, British Columbia, next month from all corners of the world has  prompted Canadian and U.S. authorities to exercise abundant caution. The U.S. Olympic Committee is strongly urging all its athletes traveling to Vancouver to get the flu vaccination. But some athletes are ignoring the committee's recommendation, and officials can't make the vaccines mandatory. Although 40 percent of Vancouver-area residents have been vaccinated, these games still offer the virus a nice, big playpen, say health officials. They point out that the West Coast city of more than 2 million is the largest host of any Winter Olympics. Like troops advancing across a battlefield, H1N1 has produced two global waves so far. The pandemic's first wave in April 2009 got the attention of Olympic hopefuls, who often tend to be young. ""More young people were being hospitalized and ended up staying in hospitals longer,"" said Dr. Reka Gustafson, director of communicable disease control for Vancouver Coastal Health, the regional health care provider. H1N1 has claimed 10 lives and led to the hospitalization of more than 250 people in the Vancouver area since the pandemic began, she said. ""I don't expect influenza to be a major issue during the Olympic Games,"" said Gustafson. ""However, you can't count on that."" As a result, officials are preparing for the possibility of a third wave. ""We figure that we'll be able to blunt it quite a bit,"" said Vancouver Coastal Health spokeswoman Anna Marie D'Angelo. Experts say as few as a dozen flu carriers traveling to attend all 16 days of the games could spread H1N1 to hundreds of people. In an extreme scenario, illness could force Olympics coaches to dig deeply into their player reserves for replacements, depending on each sport's rules, which are set by international governing boards. Would flu fears force officials to cancel Olympic events? ""In all of pandemic planning it has been recognized for some time that cancellation of mass gatherings is not an effective way to control influenza,"" Gustafson said. ""I can categorically say that we are not planning that."" Canadian health officials will be using a stockpile of vaccine to make the shots easily available during the games -- although experts point out that it takes seven to 10 days to develop immunity after the vaccine. ""Arriving here and getting a shot might not be the best way to protect yourself,"" said D'Angelo, who recommends getting the vaccine well before traveling to the games. Also included in Vancouver's arsenal against H1N1: millions of doses of Tamiflu anti-viral medication and media campaigns promoting hand washing. 30 ways to outsmart the flu . Hospitals and clinics have been designated for an expected 5,500 athletes and staff, about 10,000 media workers and at least 250,000 spectators. Lawmaker Joyce Murray has accused Canada's federal government of ""dropping the ball"" by not providing enough resources to deliver H1N1 vaccinations -- a charge the government disputes. ""However, the local health authorities have a done a great job of putting an effective plan in place,"" said Murray, who represents Vancouver in the Canadian Parliament. Providing security for the games will be about 20,500 military and police officers, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. What if their ranks are thinned by a massive flu outbreak? A backup army of about 750 military and civilian personnel will be on standby just in case. ""They've all been inoculated and they're ready to go at a moment's notice,"" said Mounted Police spokesman Staff Sgt. Mike Cote. 'Just self-isolation -- nothing draconian' Vancouver's plan during a worst-case outbreak does not include quarantining athletes or anyone else, said Gustafson. Quarantining an area, which means separating everyone including those who don't show any symptoms, isn't an effective way to control influenza, she said. Instead, emergency plans call for quickly isolating only those who show flu-like symptoms. ""Just self-isolation, nothing draconian,"" said Gustafson. Rooms have been set aside in case sick athletes need to be separated from their teammates, said top U.S. Olympic Committee chiropractic physician Dr. Mike Reed. Athletes are not more likely to contract the flu because of close contact with other athletes during competitions or in locker rooms, said Gustafson. However, athletes who train too hard may be more susceptible, said Reed. Test your knowledge with the H1N1 quiz . The shot doesn't affect athletic performance, said Reed. Neither will it taint a urine test for performance-enhancing drugs, according to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, which oversees Olympics drug testing. 'It's not about fear' Although Reed and other Olympics officials around the globe are strongly urging all athletes to get the vaccine, some are refusing it. ""It's not about fear,"" said Reed. ""They don't want something changing up in their training schedule. They don't want something different and we have to accept that."" Among those refusing the shot is U.S. Olympic ski team member and 2006 gold medalist Julia Mancuso. ""I have never taken a flu shot and would not consider the H1N1 vaccine, because I believe that you can stay healthier without the risk of any side effects or long term risks that come with vaccinations,"" Mancuso said in an e-mail to CNN.com. Side effects after an H1N1 vaccine would be rare, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They include soreness, redness or swelling around where the shot was given, as well as fainting, headache, muscle aches, fever and nausea. Medical observers will be conducting ""very intense communicable disease surveillance"" at hospital emergency rooms and elsewhere looking for signs of an outbreak, said Gustafson. As they plan for the worst, Vancouver health officials are expressing confidence. They say they have history on their side. ""Let's remember: There was a flu pandemic during the 1968 Olympics and it had no effect whatsoever on the games,"" said D'Angelo. ""We're ready.""","Largest host city of any Winter Olympics prepares for possible new wave of H1N1 .

"(CNN)The death of beloved Mexican soap opera star Lorena Rojas this week in Miami drew a deluge of heartfelt condolences -- from Los Angeles to San Juan, from Dallas to Buenos Aires. That hordes of Latinas and Latin Americans are mourning the 44-year-old actress, who starred in more than a dozen telenovelas, is no surprise to anyone who understands the deep hold that these soap operas have on the imagination of Latino culture. In fact, for Americans to fully grasp the culture of the more than 51 million Latinos who live in the U.S.,  as well as their Spanish-speaking brethren south of the border and in the Spanish-speaking Caribbean islands, they would do well to understand the importance of the telenovela. Telenovelas are such an integral part of Latino tradition, in the U.S. and in the Spanish-speaking world, that soap stars like Rojas become part a household's extended family. Fans follow the stars' lives on and off the screen and live vicariously through both their fictional characters and real lives. They are something like the Kardashians of Latino culture. What's more, social media has given fans access to their beloved celebrities 24-7, which may explain the outpouring of grief when news broke that Rojas succumbed to breast cancer that had spread to her liver. It was, after all, like losing a family member. Since her debut in the Mexican soap ""Alcanzar una Estrella,"" where she played opposite her biological sister, Mayra, Rojas had been a beloved member of Mexican households. Among the soaps she went on to star in were the sequel, ""Alcanzar una Estrella II,"" ""Cancion de Amor,"" ""Rosario,"" ""Pecados Ajenos,"" and her latest, filmed in Miami, where she lived, the Venezuelan series ""Demente Criminal."" Rojas, however, was best known for her role as Isabel in the deliciously sexy soap ""El Cuerpo del Deseo."" The story revolved around a young woman who falls in love with a 67-year old man, played by the legendary Mexican-Dominican actor Andres Garcia. In the show, he dies and comes back to life as a young stud, Mario Cimarro. In the nightly ritual of telenovela watching for millions of Latinas, such fantasy plots are exactly the point. After a hard day's work, they are the balm or the dirty martini -- the inexpensive reward and gift -- that Hispanic women offer themselves. One reason why? For immigrants, many of them laboring in a new land -- cleaning, cooking for others, slaughtering cows in meat houses, running their own businesses, for instance -- the novelas represent a shared escape, a way to stay connected with loved ones back home and to each other, here in America. They run on fast-paced cycles and feature a roller coaster of emotions and plot twists that fans savor until it all ends a few months later. One veteran actress described it to a reporter this way: ""... Cry. In this one you don't cry. Now you are laughing. Now you are happy. Getting engaged. They're killing you. You are sick."" The popularity of novelas helped Univision edge out NBC in several sweeps months, making the Spanish-language network the No. 4 network among adults 18-49. Audience share is a testament of the growth of the Latino population in the U.S., but it could also indicate a dearth of shows targeting this demographic in English-language networks. Indeed, while the American soap opera genre has continued to decline in viewership, Latino soaps have surged, partly because they have kept up with the times. While 30 years ago most story lines featured sappy Cinderella-like plots -- poor girl meets rich guy, falls in love and, after a series of tragedies, ends up with her prince -- they have evolved. Plots, twists and characters wink to issues of the day, and in many ways the shows serve as surrogate teachers, where taboos are explored and often debunked. Characters are getting divorces, remarrying, having premarital sex, cheating, having abortions, killing and getting killed. They are not just the good girls anymore -- they are naughty, and they're winning, too. But perhaps the most delightful difference between American soaps and Spanish novelas is not just how over the top, fashionable and gorgeous the stars are; it is also that when they end after several months, evil is taken out, good always wins, and there is, for the most part, a happy ending. A refreshing way to live in a country where people want to deport you and your family! In some ways, Rojas was a standard bearer for the telenovela. She may not have had a happy ending the way many of her on-screen characters did, but she lived her life like many of the women she played on the small screen: valiantly fighting cancer, divorcing, falling in love again and adopting a baby girl. She had more than a quarter-million Twitter followers and celebrated her 44th birthday with them in her final days. In her last tweet on February 10, she thanked her fans: ""Gracias a todos por celebrar mi cumple conmigo.""","Sandra Guzman: Grief over death of telenovela star Lorena Rojas can help Americans understand something about Latino culture .

"(CNN)Words matter. Especially in Iran, where what is permissible -- to say, to do, to be seen as saying or doing -- is an ever-changing thing. It took us many years of trying to finally be allowed into Iran, the country with whom the United States has probably its most contentious relationship. At the time, we thought that perhaps our welcome was an indicator of a new attitude, an opening of a window. But as it turned out, that is probably not the case. The window appeared to slam shut in particularly ugly fashion shortly after our departure. What we saw, what we came back with, is a deeply confusing story. Because the Iran you see from the inside, once you walk the streets of Tehran, meet Iranians, is a very different place than the Iran we know from the news. Nowhere else I've been has the disconnect been so extreme between what one sees and feels from the people and what one sees and hears from the government. Iran's official attitude toward America, its policies, its actions in the region, are a matter of record. How it treats its own citizens, as far as their personal behaviors, also is a matter of record. You do not want to be perceived as behaving inappropriately in Iran -- as we have seen with the recent video of kids dancing along to the song, ""Happy."" And what is inappropriate is an ever-shifting thing. What the ""government"" or the president says is OK one day might be deemed dangerous or unacceptable by the clergy or the ""basij"", the roving, unofficial but official religious police, on another -- as we came to find out.","Anthony Bourdain explores an Iran few Americans have visited since the 1980s .

"(CNN) -- I've just been watching the trailer for ""Black Jesus,"" a show that will premiere on August 7 on the Cartoon Network during its child-unfriendly late-night spot, which they call Adult Swim. Already at least one Christian group has begun to lobby the network to cancel the show, regarding its contents as blasphemous. (Cartoon Network is owned by Turner Broadcasting, which owns CNN.) From what I can tell, the series is a bit of a spoof, with some foul language. The general notion seems clever: A guy who thinks he is Jesus, who might even be Jesus, lives in a poor neighborhood of Compton, California. He's got a ragged band of followers -- they look like winos and potheads -- who follow him around with lots of bantering. The scenes shown in the trailer seem relatively funny, and it appears that nobody is quite sure whether this is a madman who thinks he is Jesus or maybe the Lord himself come back in a strange outfit and, indeed, black skin. Is this offensive? The jury will have to be out until we see whole episodes, but in conceptâ€”particularly if the rest of the show is like the trailerâ€”it does not seem so. Let me explain. First, let's look at the criticism: ""Adult Swim is not ridiculing any other religion and wouldn't dream of mocking Mohammed or Muslims, but has no problem denigrating Christians"" the conservative Christian group American Family Association writes on its website. It's certainly a good point. People feel free to mock Christianity and Jesus, but they hesitate to mock Mohammed. This is likely because some Islamic fundamentalist groups can be more than touchy and sometimes dangerous. I generally don't think one should attack Mohammed, as it obviously offends large groups of sincere followers, and there are some extremists ready to kill to make their point. It was, however, truly horrific to see what happened to Salman Rushdie in 1989 when the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa ordering Muslims to kill Rushdie, as he had written what the Ayatollah considered a blasphemous novel, ""The Satanic Verses."" I admire Rushdie immensely, as a writer and person, and I would argue that he had every right to publish ""The Satanic Verses,"" at least in Western countries. In the context of his book, a work of literature, he was clearly being satirical, and if satire goes, the whole shebang -- meaning literate and moral culture -- vanishes with it. Satire is one of the essential ways that human beings have for looking at themselves and laughing, seeing themselves in a larger context. As someone once said, tragedy is a short-term view of things; comedy is the long view. But is ""Black Jesus"" appropriate satire, and does it do anything to harm Christianity? As a Christian myself, I like the idea of seeing Jesus return in various guises, skin colors, outfits and social contexts. Why not? The Jesus I know and love was something of a party animal. His first miracle was to turn water into wine at a wedding: and lots of wine was apparently drunk. At the Last Supper, in keeping with Jewish tradition (if you regard this as a Passover feast or seder), everybody was obliged to drink four glasses of wine. In Luke 5:27-32 the Pharisees condemn Jesus and his friends for eating and drinking with ""publicans and sinners."" In Matthew 11:18-19, we read that Jesus is accused of being ""a drunken and a glutton, a friend of tax collectors and sinners."" On and on, the image of Jesus and his band, which includes a fair number of women -- including Mary Magdalene, Joanna and Susanna (see Luke 8:2-3) -- seems one of a merry-making group, not a pious and bedraggled or depressed conclave. Jesus met with whores and bartenders (publicans) and all sorts of marginal folks. It's not unreasonable to think that, if he should return today, he would socialize as well with bums and pot-growers and winos, even someone from the IRS. He would associate with anyone who would lend an ear, spreading his good news, which to Christians is the joy of the coming kingdom, the joy of giving one's time and treasure to those in need, the pleasure of becoming God's hands in the world. This was what Jesus did. Christians should understand that following Jesus means acting in the world in ways that improve it. Matthew tells us in 7:16: ""By their fruits ye shall know them."" I'm sure the message of Jesus can survive ""Black Jesus."" And I look forward to many other versions of Jesus, in many settings. He would always speak in the lingo of the neighborhood, even if to some ears this might sound ""foul-mouthed."" He would show irreverence of a sort, great joy, and a passion for justice. His sense of humor would take on many forms, as it did during his life. He would spread the gospel in whatever language and manner the context required.","Jay Parini: Trailer for new TV show ""Black Jesus"" drawing ire of conservative Christian group .

"Expensive works of art offered as inducements are at the center of the latest series of damaging allegations around the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a published report claimed. A painting, believed to be a Picasso, was allegedly gifted to Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) president and FIFA executive member Michel Platini in return for his support for the eventually successful Russian bid for the 2018 global showpiece. Another FIFA voting member, Michel D'Hooghe, from Belgium, was also the recipient of a landscape painting, given to him in a package wrapped in brown paper by Viacheslav Koloskov, a former Russian executive committee member working for his nation's attempt to host the 2018 tournament, it is alleged in a report in The Sunday Times. ""Allegations' in the Sunday Times relating to my actions in the 2018 and 2022 bidding processes are total fabrications,"" said former French international star Platini. ""The matter has now been passed to my legal advisers."" D'Hooghe told the Sunday Times that he believed the painting given to him, was ""absolutely ugly"" and he believed it had no value.  He said he had not voted for the Russian bid. The newspaper's latest revelations are based on evidence it supplied to a UK parliamentary committee, which itself has been investigating the circumstances around the award of the World Cup host countries,  particularly in the light of England's failed bid for the 2018 competition. The House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee (DCMS) has now published details of the investigations by the Sunday Times which claim the England bid commissioned ""high-level intelligence gathering and and surveillance on the other countries bidding to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups."" It also claims England's bid used private security companies and a former member of the UK government's intelligence service MI6 to gather information on its rivals. The previously unreported material contains a series of claims around the role allegedly played by Russian President Vladimir Putin in making sure his country would host football's premier competition, hard on the heels of winning the rights to stage the Sochi Winter Olympics earlier this year. It claims that Putin was initially skeptical about Russia's bid but had later thrown his full weight behind the process. ""He (Putin) took a personal interest in the running of the bid in mid-2010,"" the committee report reveals. Under the heading, ""Intelligence relating to Russia 2018"" a series of allegations are revealed about Putin's role in brokering a major bilateral trade deal for gas with Qatar, the winners of the 2022 bid, in exchange for each others votes and the votes of others of their supporters. The allegations also detail the plundering of Russia's national art collection, either from the vaults of the State Hermitage Museum in St.Petersburg or the Kremlin archives, as alleged kickbacks to Platini and D'Hooghe. In a statement given to CNN, officials behind the Russian bid have also strongly denied any wrongdoing. ""Russia 2018 categorically rejects all of the allegations made in the Sunday Times today as entirely unfounded speculation,"" it said. ""These allegations are not new, but the evidence has only ever indicated that Russia 2018 behaved professionally and fairly throughout the bidding process. ""The Russia 2018 Bid Committee operated in full compliance with the spirit and letter of FIFA's Code of Ethics, and sought to abide by the FIFA bidding guidelines at all times. ""This kind of speculation will not affect Russia 2018's focus on doing what we have been doing for nearly four years already: making great progress towards our objective of hosting the best ever FIFA World Cup in 2018."" The alleged pivotal role of FIFA president Sepp Blatter in the bidding process is also highlighted in the published reports of the DCMS and the Sunday Times. The claim is made that Blatter and Putin ""jointly 'hit the phones' to drum up votes for Russia on the eve of the secret ballot in Zurich on December 2,  2010."" Blatter was ""absolutely committed"" to the Russian bid it was said. Earlier this month, football's world governing body published a report that cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing in their winning of the hosting rights for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. But within hours of the announcement, Michael Garcia, the U.S. attorney who had led the investigation, went public with his disappointment at the findings, labeling them ""incomplete and erroneous"" and claiming that his work had been misrepresented. The saga took a further twist when FIFA later announced it had lodged a criminal complaint in the Swiss courts into the ""possible misconduct of individual persons in connection with the awarding of the hosting rights of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup."" FIFA told CNN Sunday that it was unable to comment on the specific allegations in the DCMS and Sunday Times reports. ""Matters related to the 2018/2022 inquiry are solely handled by the Investigatory Chamber of the independent FIFA Ethics Committee,"" it said. ""Therefore we are not in a position to comment on on-going proceedings nor on names and other information circulated in the media, particularly as we do not know against which individuals and for what reasons investigations are in process nor do we know the details of what is actually in the investigation reports."" It added: ""The independent Chairman of the Audit and Compliance Committee Domenico Scala is currently evaluating the matter to decide on the next steps including the compiling of relevant information from the investigation which needs to be provided to the FIFA Executive Committee. ""In parallel, the entire reports have been provided to the Swiss General Attorney. As such, FIFA has no further comment for the time-being."" Meanwhile, the English Football Association also responded Sunday to the reports, claiming that the 2018 bid chairman Andy Anson and his team had fully co-operated with the original FIFA investigation. ""The Fifa Ethics Committee made specific requests and responding to these requests involved searching in excess of 500,000 documents,"" the Guardian newspaper reported. ""The search parameters were established with Mr Garcia's office. The documents searched included intelligence gathered by the bid team. All documents within the search parameters were disclosed."" It added that Anson had only shared with Garcia information that could be substantiated. ""Everything else was hearsay, gossip and rumor,"" it added. The UK Parliament is set to debate the findings of the DCMS report Monday.","Further allegations published around award of 2018 and 2022 World Cups .

"(CNN)Africa is a continent. It's not a country. This, unfortunately, is a notion that needs to be constantly reinforced. Though it is enormous and as diverse as any place can be, we tend, in the West, to look at it like a monolith. In fact, even neighboring countries like Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo can feel, up close, as different as Mars and Texas. Liberia and Namibia bear almost no resemblance to each other. Ghana and Morocco? Maybe it's the sheer size and complexity of African issues -- the at times crushing weight of history, the ugliness of much of that history, Europe and the West's unambiguous complicity in so much of it -- that keeps us from even trying to look beyond the surface. Over the years, my crew and I have shot in Liberia, Ghana, Namibia, South Africa, Mozambique, the Congo and much of North Africa. But what we've never done, was step back to our first impressions, to the Africa of Hollywood films and nature documentaries that many of us grew up with: vast herds of wild animals charging across the Serengeti, lions and giraffes and zebras and hippos, safari gear, Land Rovers and the equally magnificent ""natives"" in their brightly colored robes. Does this Africa even exist? And if so, how? And for whom? That Africa, the Cinemascope Africa does exist. You can find it in and around the unspeakably beautiful Ngorongoro crater in Tanzania where lions and their traditional adversaries, Masai warriors, still live much as they did a hundred years ago. The lions survive because they are protected. Visiting Tanzania to gaze at and photograph these beautiful but deadly creatures (and other animals) is a major industry, bringing many millions to the country each year. It makes financial sense to protect both animals and the environment they live in. The Masai, on the other hand, believe themselves to be the keepers and protectors of all the world's cattle. Their status, their wealth is based almost entirely on number of cattle and goats. Their diet, traditionally, has been almost exclusively meat (mostly goat and the occasional bit of cow's blood) and dairy. They generally use their cattle to provide dairy and tap them for blood (without harming them) to mix with curdled milk. In return, adult Masai enjoy cardio and physical strength and endurance that would qualify as Olympian any day of the week. They are herders -- and warriors. Their status within their tribe, their image of themselves based largely on their traditional roles as defenders of their herds -- as warriors, lion killers. Lions eat cattle and goats when they can get them. The Masai protect and rely on cattle and goats to live. Lions roam over large areas of terrain, competing for food with any number of other predators. Masai herd their cattle over large areas of terrain. Thus it has been for centuries. Lions are beautiful living creatures worth many millions of dollars from the thousands and thousands of people from all over the world who want to come to Tanzania and gape at them. The Masai are beautiful living people who somewhat fewer people from all over the world want to come and gape at. You see the problem. Many hard working, well-intentioned people are trying to help resolve this conflict of interest. But it raises, once again, the question we run into frequently in our travels: who does the natural world exist for? For the people who live there, have always lived there? Even when they become ... inconvenient? Or the animals who also have always lived there, but like their adversaries, are under threat, and can no longer survive without the intervention of (usually) pale-skinned experts in comfortable shoes? It's an uncomfortable question. One would have to be truly monstrous to suggest that one be sacrificed for the other. But the slow grind of history is already making that decision for us, and the outcome is often not pretty. If we are the guardians of the environment, obligated to do our very best to protect the natural world -- if that natural world, increasingly, exists only at our pleasure and as the result of much hard work and vigilance -- are we not also our brothers' keepers? Where is that line? That balance between the needs of man and that of the incredible, graceful, terrible, gorgeous creatures who still manage to survive in what passes for the wild? I sure as hell don't know. So, on one hand, this episode is the ""nature show"" we always hoped to do -- the ""safari show"". And believe me, we did it right. I retired, after a long day's filming on the plains or in the bush, to a hot, freshly drawn bubble bath surrounded by rose petals. I drank sherry from a cut glass tumbler on my balcony, looking down into the Ngorongoro Crater. Woke every morning to my choice of omelets and silver service. But the persistent image of this episode, the one that hangs in my memory, and I hope will hang in yours, is of the running man. The young Masai. Where is he going?","Bourdain steps back to his first impressions of Africa, a land of Hollywood films and nature documentaries .

"(CNN) -- Japan may withdraw the last of its military mission in Iraq by the end of the year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday. Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force was initially deployed in 2004 to help in reconstruction and left in 2006. Japan's Air Self-Defense Force has been airlifting materials and troops between Kuwait and Iraq since 2006 to support U.S.-led coalition forces. ""The political and security situations have improved,"" and the Iraqi government suggested it wants countries to downsize their presence, Defense Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters, according to the Kyodo news agency. Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said Japan will discuss an official schedule for ending the mission with the United States, the United Nations and Iraq. Withdrawal would mark the end of Japan's military presence in Iraq. The country's Ground Self-Defense Force was initially deployed in 2004 to help in reconstruction and left in 2006. The Japanese Navy continues to take part in refueling missions in support of the U.S.-led coalition in and around Afghanistan. Except for a three-month hiatus, Japan had been refueling coalition warships taking part in interdiction operations against terrorists in the Indian Ocean since 2001. As an officially pacifist nation since losing World War II, Japan's participation in these missions has been controversial.","Japan may withdraw the last of its military mission in Iraq by the end of the year .

"(CNN)MERS-CoV, short for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, first surfaced in Saudi Arabia in spring 2012. As of June 8, more than 1,000 cases of MERS have been confirmed in 25 countries, according to the World Health Organization. Two of those cases were in the United States. There have been over 400 deaths worldwide. Here are five things you should know about MERS: . It's a coronavirus . MERS is in the same family of viruses as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome -- coronavirus) as well as the common cold. However, unlike SARS, which sickened more than 8,000 people in 2003 and killed 773 worldwide, MERS does not spread easily between humans -- at least not yet. The virus acts like a cold and attacks the respiratory system, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. But symptoms, which include fever and a cough, are severe and can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea have also been seen, according to the WHO. The average age of MERS victims is 51, officials say, although the ages range from 2 to 94. Researchers don't know how MERS spreads . Although all MERS cases have been linked to six countries on the Arabian Peninsula, limited human-to-human transmission has been seen among people in close contact with patients, including health care workers. Although such transmission appears to be limited, health officials are concerned about MERS because of its virulence -- it can be fatal in up to one-third of cases, Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general for the U.S. Public Health Service and director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Friday. ""The virus has not shown to spread in a sustained way in communities,"" the CDC says on its website. The WHO and CDC have not issued any travel warnings related to MERS, although the CDC suggests travelers to the Arabian Peninsula practice ""enhanced precautions."" And ""you are not considered to be at risk for MERS-CoV infection if you have not had close contact, such as caring for or living with someone who is being evaluated for MERS-CoV infection,"" according to the CDC website. Camels appear to be a link in the MERS chain . Camels may be one clue. In a paper published earlier this week, researchers said they had isolated the live MERS virus from two single-humped camels, known as dromedaries. And in February, scientists published a finding that nearly three-quarters of camels in Saudi Arabia tested positive for past MERS exposure. MERS was also found in a bat in Saudi Arabia, the CDC says. ""The way humans become infected from an animal and/or environmental source is still under investigation,"" the WHO said last month. It may have a seasonal pattern . Officials have noted a surge in MERS cases this spring, and a similar increase was also seen last spring, Schuchat said on Friday. But they don't know whether the factors that lead to MERS may have a seasonal pattern, or whether the virus changes to become more easily transmissible. There are no treatments and no vaccine . As of now, doctors can treat symptoms of MERS, such as fever or breathing difficulties, Schuchat said. However, there is no vaccine and no specific medicine, such as an antiviral drug, that targets MERS.","MERS has shown limited human-to-human transmission .
It's in the same family as SARS and the common cold .
There is no treatment and no vaccine ."
"A Texas state senator tried Tuesday to block an abortion bill by attempting a 13-hour filibuster, but appeared to fall short after 10 hours when the chairman ruled she had gone off topic. But a member of the Senate then moved that the ruling be appealed, and the status of the ruling was in doubt. Fort Worth Democrat Wendy Davis, 50, took to the floor of the chamber late Tuesday morning to criticize the bill, which would  be among the nation's most restrictive. Rules called for her to stand, unaided, until midnight (1 a.m. Wednesday ET), for the filibuster to succeed. At the outset, Davis said she was speaking for families whose ""personal relationships with their doctor and their creator"" would be violated by the bill. ""These voices have been silenced by a governor who made blind partisanship and personal political ambition the official business of our great state,"" she said. ""And sadly, he's being abetted by legislative leaders who either share this blind partisanship or simply do not have the strength to oppose it."" Davis had a snack and a small amount of water before beginning, her office said. She was not allowed to lean or take a bathroom break. At about 10 p.m. (11 p.m. ET), Davis talked about the abortion pill, RU-486, and the chairman ruled that her comments were off topic. Earlier in the evening, a fellow senator helped Davis put on a back brace, which angered some lawmakers who said it violated filibuster rules. That view was upheld in a vote, and she was given a warning. Before that, she had been ruled off topic. Davis was allowed three warnings before the Senate was to be allowed to vote on whether she must stop her filibuster. The sneaker-wearing senator spent much of the time reading testimony and messages from women decrying the bill and recounting stories of the struggles they, their friends or relatives faced in the days before birth control and abortion were legalized. ""Women realize that these bills will not protect their heath,"" she said. ""They will only reduce their access to abortion providers and limit their ability to make their own family-planning decisions."" The bill would ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and tighten standards on abortion clinics and the doctors who work at them. Critics say it would shut most of the abortion clinics in Texas. It has passed the state House of Representatives, and Gov. Rick Perry, a former Republican presidential candidate, has said he'll sign it. ""In Texas, we value all life, and we've worked to cultivate a culture that supports the birth of every child,"" Perry said. ""We have an obligation to protect unborn children, and to hold those who peddle these abortions to standards that would minimize the death, disease and pain they cause."" While Republicans hold a majority in the Senate, they don't appear to have the votes to thwart a filibuster. Abortion rights advocates were rallying behind Davis online, pushing the hashtag #standwithwendy on Twitter. ""Like never before, people in Texas are standing up to demand that politicians respect women's ability to make our own personal medical decisions, and the whole country is watching,"" Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement on the filibuster. Richards -- the daughter of former Texas Gov. Ann Richards -- said, ""This bill is dangerous and deeply unpopular, and it will hurt a lot of women. We won't go back, we won't back down, and we won't forget when these politicians are on the ballot."" ""Partisanship and ambition are not unusual in a state capitol, but here, in Texas, right now, it has risen to a level of profound irresponsibility and the raw abuse of power,"" she said in a statement on her website. Davis was elected to the Texas Senate in 2008, defeating a longtime Republican incumbent. Last year, she staged a filibuster to force a special session in an attempt to stop $5 billion in cuts to Texas public schools, according to her website. Davis, who became a single mother at age 19, went on to graduate with honors from Harvard Law School, it says.","Sen. Wendy Davis said to have digressed .

"London, England (CNN) -- Eurostar canceled all service this weekend after severe wintry weather in northern France caused the breakdown of an ""unprecedented"" six trains, stranding thousands of passengers on both sides of the English Channel on the weekend before Christmas. Five trains with about 2,000 passengers stopped running Friday night inside the Channel Tunnel, also called the Chunnel, which runs between Britain and France. A sixth train broke down Saturday after Eurostar tried to run four trains from London to the Continental mainland in order to prepare for the resumption of normal service. About 700 people were aboard when that train stopped in the Ebbsfleet area of Kent. In a statement on its Web site Saturday, Eurostar said it will conduct a series of test trains Sunday ""to better understand the problems that have been occurring."" ""We are committed to restoring our services as soon as possible but our key priority is the safety and comfort of our customers,"" the statement said. Those passengers affected by the breakdowns are being offered a full refund, another return ticket, and 150 pounds in compensation. About 25,000 people should have been traveling on Saturday, Eurostar said. ""We strongly recommend that travelers whose journeys are not essential change their tickets for travel on a later date or have their tickets refunded,"" Eurostar said on its Web site. The trains became stuck in the tunnel because the air inside was much warmer than the air outside the tunnel entrance in France, Eurostar spokeswoman Amelle Mouhaddib told CNN. ""It's a bit like taking a bottle of beer out of the fridge into a warm room -- within minutes it's covered in condensation,"" said Eurostar CEO Richard Brown. ""We think that was the principle cause of the electrical failures on the trains."" He called the number of breakdowns ""completely unprecedented."" Eurotunnel, which operates the Channel Tunnel, said it evacuated all 1,364 Eurostar passengers who were stuck Friday after the trains ""lost traction,"" but one of the five trains remained in the tunnel and was blocking part of it, according to a Eurotunnel spokeswoman who asked not to be named, in keeping with policy. The train that broke down Saturday was being towed back to the tunnel entry so passengers could be removed and transferred, Eurostar said. Passengers evacuated Friday night described how a trip that was supposed to take around two hours lasted more than 14, factoring in the one-hour time difference between London and Paris. ""I left at 6:30 from Paris and we just arrived at 8 o'clock,"" passenger Robert Ricine told Sky News after arriving at London's St. Pancras station, a Eurostar hub. He and other passengers complained they were given no food or water and little information during the ordeal. ""It was a very upsetting experience for those passengers traveling, and we're very sorry for what happened to them,"" Brown said. ""We will be taking a very close look at what happened [and] what lessons can be learned principally to actually understand why it was that we had five trains breaking down."" The problems started after 9 p.m. (4 p.m. ET) Friday, when the first of the five Eurostar trains became stuck. It was helped out of the tunnel by a Eurotunnel locomotive, which took it all the way to London with passengers still on board, the Eurotunnel spokeswoman said. Passengers on the second and third trains to fail were evacuated via the service tunnel to a Eurotunnel train, which brought them to the exit, she said. One of the failed trains was pulled out of the tunnel, but authorities were having difficulty removing the other, she said. The fourth and fifth trains were running close together when they failed, so Eurotunnel locomotives coupled them and either pushed or pulled them to the English side of the tunnel, the spokeswoman said. Passengers from the fifth train boarded the one in front, and Eurotunnel locomotives then towed that train to London, she said. The Chunnel is actually two tunnels separated by a third and smaller service tunnel, so the train that remained stuck inside did not mean the entire tunnel was blocked, the Eurotunnel spokeswoman said. The Chunnel is 50.5 kilometers (31.4 miles) long, 38 kilometers (23 miles) of which are underwater. Brown said keeping passengers on the trains is the quickest and safest evacuation method. ""Because there were five trains, it took us ... longer than we would wish to get those trains out and those passengers on their way home,"" he said. Despite the stoppage of service Saturday, noncommercial vehicles, including cars, motorbikes and camper vans, were still able to travel through the tunnel. French authorities told all trucks to get off the highways on the French side of the Channel because of the hazardous conditions, Eurotunnel spokesman John Keefe told CNN. No trucks were entering the tunnel from the French side, and trucks were unable to enter on the English side because they wouldn't be allowed to drive upon reaching France. The trouble resulted in a backup of freight traffic on either side of the tunnel, Keefe said. On the British side, Kent Police early Saturday implemented Operation Stack, which goes into effect any time there is a problem affecting freight traffic in the tunnel. The operation lets police manage the backlog of trucks that builds up whenever the tunnel is closed. A Kent Police spokesman could not estimate how many trucks were waiting Saturday morning but said Operation Stack allows police to manage as many as 2,300 trucks. The poor weather in France also created problems for boats intending to sail across the Channel from England. The Port of Dover, a major exit point to France, was operating restricted services Saturday because of weather problems in Calais, France, according to the port's Web site. ""The French authorities prohibited traffic from leaving the Port of Calais owing to the treacherous road conditions, which curtailed all services to Calais,"" the port said. ""Tourist traffic is now being permitted to use the port and ships are sailing to Calais."" It was not immediately clear whether freight traffic had resumed between Dover and Calais.

"The sun is not yet up over the desert, but already 50 horses and riders are gathered at Qatar's Endurance Village in Al-Wakra, half an hour's drive from the capital Doha. They are gathered to compete in a 120-kilometer (74.5-mile) endurance race, the likes of which are held here most weeks. Masked riders gaze steely-eyed into the desert as their horses crest their necks and paw the ground, eager to get the race under way. The starter counts down in Arabic, and the horses and riders surge over the starting line, galloping into the pitch-black desert with their high-held tails streaming behind them. Hot on their heels a fleet of Land Cruisers hares after them across the sand, the glare of their headlights creating a moving oasis of light.  These are the support vehicles from which the owners, trainers and managers can observe the race in progress and shout instructions. Today, the horses will complete laps of a 30 km (18.6 miles) course, stopping for checks at the end of each lap.  Any horse deemed unfit to continue the race will be eliminated at each check point. They will travel at speeds of up to 40 km per hour (25 mph) for around eight hours. Of the 50 who started the race, fewer than a quarter will complete it. Most of the horses are pure-breed Arabians who are revered in Islamic culture, prized for their beauty, intelligence and, above all, their endurance. It was the Arabian horse that formed the genetic blueprint for the modern racehorse, with every modern thoroughbred tracing its DNA to just three ""original"" oriental stallions imported to the UK in the 18th century. Some say the Arabian horse was a gift to mankind from Allah. The ancient breed is supremely well-adapted to the unforgiving desert terrain of the Middle East. Many of these animals are ex-racehorses, gradually trained and brought up to fitness to compete in endurance races. Although the sport is ancient in its origins, today's races are as professional as they are competitive, with horses conditioned to the peak of fitness and subject to rigorous veterinary inspections both during and after the race. At each stage's completion, the horses are doused with water and their heart rates measured. A team of veterinarians inspects each horse thoroughly before it is allowed to continue the race. The number of competitors is gradually whittled down until only the very fittest are left to contest the final laps. Endurance is taken seriously in this part of the world: many of the horses are owned by members of the Qatari and Dubai Royal families. One such owner is Sheikh Maktoum, ruler of Dubai. His son Sheikh Rashid is a champion endurance rider in his own right who is competing here today. ""I've been riding since I was 11 years old and doing endurance since 2006,"" he said during an inspection. ""Some people in my family are more into flat racing (his father owns one of the most important thoroughbred racing operations in the world), some are more into endurance racing.  I actually started with polo but then I was attracted by endurance and I loved it. Hopefully I will be doing it for the rest of my life."" Unfortunately for Sheikh Rashid, he and his striking grey horse are eliminated after the penultimate lap.  But is it one of his compatriots from Dubai who claims first place in a sprint finish with another rider.  They are among only a handful of riders to complete the grueling course. The enduring appeal of such a sport is easy to understand; physically and strategically demanding, it is also an expression of the extreme respect with which horses -- particularly Arabian ones -- are treated in this part of the world. Muslims were told that if they treated these precious horses with love and respect, they would be handsomely rewarded, both in their earthly life and beyond. While the winning rider accepts this congratulations from the crowd, his horse -- a magnificent chestnut with the dish-shaped face and high tail carriage characteristic of the breed -- is handed to a team of grooms to be looked after. With a last look back over his shoulder as he is led away, the horse flares his nostrils and whinnies, a final call to the desert from whence he came.","The ancient tradition of desert racing continues in the United Arab Emirates .

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- The oldest known image of the apostles Andrew and John have been discovered in catacombs under the city of Rome, dating back to the 4th century AD, archaeologists announced Tuesday. The paintings were found in the same location where the oldest known painting of St. Paul was discovered last year, the Pontifical Commission for Sacred Archeology said Tuesday. They are part of a group of paintings around an image of Jesus as the Good Shepherd on the ceiling of what is thought to have been a Roman noblewoman's tomb, experts said. A painting of St. Peter makes up the fourth member of the group, but older images of him are thought to exist, Vatican experts said. Their inclusion in the tomb shows the aristocrats were among the last Romans to convert to Christianity, archaeologist Fabrizio Bisconti said. The Roman matron must have been very rich, he said, as the colors and richness of the decoration show. The images of the apostles' heads and shoulders against a deep red background were uncovered after two years of work, Vatican experts said. Archaeologists used a new laser technology to remove layers of white carbon calcium deposited on the frescoes over the centuries without disturbing the paintings. They are located in the catacombs of St. Tecla, one of the 40 Roman catacombs under Rome. It sits under a modern eight-story building in a working-class neighborhood. It is closed to the public and its entrance is mostly hidden. The Vatican spent about 60,000 euros (about $74,000) on the archaeological work, it said. The apostles were a group of a dozen men, according to Christian tradition, who spread the gospel of Jesus after his crucifixion. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","Images found in painting on ceiling of what is thought to be tomb of noblewoman .

"(CNN) -- Eleven climbers died on Pakistan's K2 mountain after an ice avalanche knocked down a fixed rope climbers were using to reach the summit, a mountaineer at their base camp said Sunday. Pakistan's K2 is the second highest peak in the world. Among the dead was a sherpa who had gone up K2 -- the world's second tallest mountain -- to help in rescue efforts, said mountaineer Fredrik Strang, who also assisted in the rescue attempts. The deaths happened after 17 climbers, in different expeditions from around the world, had come together to make it to K2's peak on Friday, said Pat Falvey, a climber in Ireland who was in touch with some of the 17. As the 17 were descending early Saturday, a ""moving river of ice broke loose ... like an iceberg breaking loose from a glacier,"" knocking down the fixed rope the group had been using to move from higher reaches to a camp at a lower altitude, Falvey said. The rope's collapse caused three climbers to fall to their deaths, said Falvey, who was posting online updates for one of the expeditions. iReport.com: Are you a mountain climber? Ever attempt K2? Two climbers decided to go on and managed to return to base camp, but the rest decided to wait and hope rescuers could reach them, Falvey said. The avalanche had created ""icy, dangerous conditions"" on the slope, Falvey said. As time went on and rescuers didn't come, the remaining climbers decided to continue their descent, but some of them fell to their deaths in the mountain's ""bottleneck"" area, Falvey said. The rest eventually were helped down by rescuers, Falvey and Strang said. Falvey and Strang said the survivors told them what had happened but were not immediately in condition to speak publicly.  See a map of K2 mountain » . Among the killed climbers were Dutch, Irish, Italian, French, Norwegian, Korean, and Nepalese citizens, Falvey said. One of the killed was Irish climber Gerard McDonnell, Falvey said. The bodies of the 11 may never be recovered, but rescuers and the mountaineers who made it down are certain the 11 are dead, Strang said. The site of the accidents, about 5 miles up the mountain, is what climbers call the ""Dead Zone"" because the body would never recover if stuck in such freezing conditions with so little oxygen, Falvey said. Strang said Sunday the death toll was not expected to rise, because no one else was believed to be missing. Strang said the deaths could have been avoided. Too many people were climbing together ""at a very slow speed"" and should have begun their descent sooner, he said. ""Coming down at dawn, in the dark, with little oxygen is very, very dangerous,"" he said. Though K2 is the world's second-highest mountain, many climbers consider it more technically challenging than Mount Everest, the world's highest peak. Statistics compiled by AdventureStats.com suggest this was the deadliest incident at K2. The site says 66 people -- not counting those in the latest incident -- have died on the mountain since 1939. A chart compiled by viewfinderpanoramas.org lists 284 climbers as having ever reached the summit of K2.","Mountaineer says 11 dead, including sherpa who tried to rescue climbers .

"They seemed so triumphant at the time, the lyrics to country music star Mindy McCready's hope-filled title track to her most recent album, ""I'm Still Here."" ""On a cold dark cloud, with nowhere to fall but down, like a single, naked, unrelenting tear ... I'm still here."" Now, those words sound like a cry for help. On Sunday afternoon, McCready, whose turbulent personal life overshadowed her music, was found dead on the front porch of her Arkansas home, the victim, authorities said, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She was 37. McCready also appears to have shot and killed a dog that belonged to her late boyfriend, record producer David Wilson, before shooting herself, Cleburne County Sheriff Marty Moss said Monday. McCready is fifth 'Celebrity Rehab' cast member to die in two years . Moss added that it appeared McCready was home alone. McCready leaves behind two sons, 6-year-old Zander and 10-month-old Zayne. ""Zayne and Zander are loved, cared for and comfortable with foster families at this time,"" her representative told CNN in a statement. The boys are in foster homes, the representative told CNN. Just a month earlier, police had paid another visit to the house in Heber Springs. On that day, they found Wilson, the infant's father, dead on the porch. It has been reported that he also committed suicide by shooting himself, but Arkansas authorities say it's still an open investigation. ""We're currently still gathering information in regards to Mr. Wilson's case and Ms. McCready's case,"" Moss said. ""When we're able to lay all that out there, we will do so at that time."" Just a few weeks ago, a sobbing McCready appeared on NBC's ""Today"" show and denied she had anything to do with Wilson's death. ""Oh, my God, no. Oh, my God, no,"" she said. ""He was my life. We were each other's life."" After Wilson's death, McCready took a turn for the worse. Her father pushed for her to be committed to a mental institution. The father of her oldest son, Billy McKnight, tried to regain custody of Zander. Court papers say ""McKnight is concerned about McCready's psychological state"" and ""has grave concerns for the welfare and safety"" of Zander. The long, tortured journey of Mindy McCready . Spiraling downward . Born Malinda McCready, she burst onto the music scene in 1996 with her debut album, ""Ten Thousand Angels."" It sold more than 2 million copies. Her chart-topping hit ""Guys Do It All The Time"" followed that same year. In all, she put 14 songs and six of her albums on the Billboard country charts. But through it all, she was spiraling downward; the final fall was painful and precipitous. She struggled, often publicly, with addiction and mental illness. In 2004, McCready was placed on three years' probation after she pleaded guilty to fraudulently obtaining the painkiller OxyContin at a pharmacy. The next year, she was arrested in Nashville for drunken driving, and was allegedly beaten and choked by ex-boyfriend Billy McKnight, who was charged with attempted murder. ""Yes, things have been going bad,"" she told CNN in 2005. ""I think it's God's way of getting my attention, saying, 'You better wake up, girl. I have important stuff for you to do in life,' and I've definitely been preoccupied or sidetracked doing the wrong things."" Before 2005 ended, McCready had suffered two drug overdoses, was arrested on drug charges, was pregnant with McKnight's child and, authorities say, attempted suicide. She attempted suicide again in 2008, authorities say, and overdosed again on drugs in 2010 before joining the cast of VH1's ""Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew."" The reality show chronicles the lives of celebrities as they're treated for alcohol and drug addiction. Stars reflect on McCready's death . Celebrity rehab . Dr. Drew Pinsky said he contacted McCready last month after her boyfriend's death. ""When I heard she was struggling, I did reach out to her and urged her to go to take care of herself, get in a facility if she felt she needed,"" said Pinsky, who hosts a program on CNN's sister network HLN. ""Her biggest fear was the stigma of doing so and what people would think if she, God forbid, took care of herself. And this to me is the most distressing part of this story. She is a lovely woman, we have lost her, and it didn't have to go down like this."" On one episode of the show, McCready performed ""I'm Still Here,"" dedicating it to the other cast members, who included Dennis Rodman, Heidi Fleiss and Mackenzie Phillips. ""When I was writing this song, I was in jail,"" the singer said tearfully.  ""I never knew it, but I was writing for all of you."" Custody battle . In recent years, McCready had waged a public battle for custody of her elder son, Zander, whose father is McKnight. In 2011, she took the boy from her mother, who had legal custody, and fled with him to her home in Arkansas, saying she had concerns over his safety. McCready fights for custody of her son . A judge ordered authorities to pick up the boy and, days later, authorities found the boy and McCready in a closet at her home. In addition to her relationship with McKnight, McCready had romances with musician David Malloy and actor Dean Cain; she also said she had had an affair with baseball player Roger Clemens, which he didn't confirm or deny. But Clemens did issue a statement Monday from training camp with the Houston Astros in Kissimmee, Florida. ""Yes, this is sad news,"" he said. ""I had heard over time that she was trying to get peace and direction in her life. The few times that I had met her and her manager/agent they were extremely nice."" In 2010, Vivid Entertainment released a porn video called ""Mindy McCready, Baseball Mistress"" that featured McCready having sex with a man referred to as ""Peter"" and talking about her exploits with Clemens. Country outpouring . Sunday night, country music stars offered their condolences as they learned of McCready's death. ""My heart goes out to Mindy McCready's family. I knew her well,"" singer LeAnn Rimes said on Twitter.  ""It's a horrible tragedy. May peace be with her sons."" Carrie Underwood said she grew up listening to McCready. And country artist Terri Clark said she had had some fun times with her ""back in the day."" ""I hope our society shows compassion and realizes the severity and reality of mental illness, and addiction,"" she tweeted. Singer Wynonna Judd posted a series of tweets also calling attention to addiction and mental illness. ""It breaks my heart what addiction continues to take from this life,"" she said. ""Addiction is a disEASE & not a character flaw. When the pain becomes too much, it causes people to want that pain to stop. This is just so unbelieveable & so sad."" Mindy McCready: A playlist . In her words . A year ago, McCready posted excerpts of a book she said was upcoming about her life. She acknowledged a difficult upbringing, personal problems and the challenges she faced turning her life around. ""I haven't had a hit in almost a decade,"" she wrote in January 2012 on her official fan website. ""I've spent my fortune, tarnished my public view and made myself the brunt of punch line after punch line. ""I've been beaten, sued, robbed, arrested, jailed, and evicted. ""But I'm still here.

But Sunday, on the porch of her home, she may have changed her mind. On Monday, McCready's publicist asked that the family be left alone. ""It is with the deepest sadness we say goodbye to an extraordinary and gifted talent, a daughter, a mother and friend, Miss Mindy McCready,"" said Kat Atwood in a statement.

"Around this time of year, you're more likely to find college students in the library cramming for final exams than out partying. In an environment where the workload is endless and there's always more to be done, a quick fix to help buckle down and power through becomes very tempting. Prescription ADHD medications like Adderall, Ritalin, and Vyvanse are becoming increasingly popular for overworked and overscheduled college students -- who haven't been diagnosed with ADHD. ""Our biggest concern ... is the increase we have observed in this behavior over the past decade,"" says Sean McCabe, research associate professor at the University of Michigan Substance Abuse Research Center. Full-time college students were twice as likely to have used Adderall non-medically as their counterparts who were not full-time students, according to a National Survey on Drug Use and Health report released in 2009. The numbers vary significantly by school, with the greatest proportion of users at private and ""elite"" universities. Some researchers estimate about 30% of students use stimulants non-medically. More students think marijuana is OK . ""When we look at upperclassmen, the number really begins to jump,"" says Alan DeSantis, professor of communications at the University of Kentucky who has conducted research on stimulant use in college. ""The more time you stay on campus, the more likely you are to use."" Of course, by and large the most common use is to concentrate while studying, with more than 90% of users doing it for this purpose. ADHD stimulants ""strengthen the brain's brakes, its inhibitory capacities, so it can control its power more effectively,"" said Dr. Edward Hallowell, a psychiatrist and ADHD expert. ""They do this by increasing the amount of certain neurotransmitters, like dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine."" Students say they take these stimulants for the ""right reasons,"" to be more productive in classes and to stay afloat in the sea of intense competition. In a 2008 study of 1,800 college students, 81% of students interviewed (DeSantis 2008) thought illicit use of ADHD medication was ""not dangerous at all"" or ""slightly dangerous."" While the picture of a methamphetamine user has hollowed cheeks, rotting teeth, and skin sores, an amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (Adderall) user looks just like anybody else. ""It helps me stay focused and be more efficient, which is very helpful with the chaos of college,"" says one university student who takes Adderall anywhere from once a month to a few times a week, depending on her schedule and workload. Students did not want to be identified because of their illegal use of the prescription drugs. Yet these drugs are Schedule II substances, sitting pretty on the Drug Enforcement Administration's list right next to cocaine, meth and morphine. ""College students tend to underestimate the potential harms associated with the nonmedical use of prescription stimulants,"" McCabe says. Students may not know the stimulant's documented contraindications (situations in which a drug might be harmful) or recommended precautions or how it may interact with other drugs, McCabe says. Hallowell is also concerned that students taking controlled substances without prescriptions and physician supervision, noting that they may not know the dosage. WATCH: ADHD meds don't work long-term . Short-term adverse consequences include sleep difficulties, restlessness, headaches, irritability and depressed feelings. Other side effects include loss of appetite, nervousness, and changes in sex drive. The long term risk of psychological and physical dependence is of concern for routine users that may find they do not feel they can function optimally without it. Schedule II substances are classified by the DEA as having a high potential for abuse. While students' knowledge of the health dangers are limited, even less consideration is given to the illegality of use. Obtaining stimulants from friends with prescriptions, as the vast majority of college students do, seems less dangerous and illegal than buying drugs off the street. ""The fact that it's illegal really doesn't cross my mind,"" one student says. ""It's not something that I get nervous about because it's so widespread and simple."" The biggest barrier to changing attitudes is the effectiveness of stimulants on campuses where the ends justify the means, researchers believe. After those late library nights, many students praise the little pill that got them through their hefty textbooks and into the morning. After taking Adderall, says one university student, ""I just feel very alive and awake and ready for challenges that come my way."" ""I'm on page 15 (of my paper) in just a few hours ... and I'm very confident in it.""","Some college students take ADHD medication to help with concentration .
According to a survey, the vast majority don't think there are risks .
Experts caution they may not know proper dosage or think about drug interactions ."
"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- They line up early every Saturday morning at the decrepit gymnasium that houses the La Matanza Barter Club. Nelly Vasquez and her 6-month-old daughter, Antonella trades wool for food. Club members shuffle in carrying sacks stuffed with everything from homemade clothing to homegrown vegetables, set up their stands and begin a day of bartering. The La Matanza Barter Club in the working-class Buenos Aires neighborhood of Isidro Casanova is one of more than 100 that now function throughout Argentina. They provide a vital service for people who are short on cash by helping them make ends meet. Each item brought to the club is given a value by its owner, who then trades it with other members for whatever goods they are offering. ""What we do here is a fair and honest trading. I look at this like a job, and I work hard at it, and it helps me live better,"" says Deolindo Farias, 66, who brings fresh bananas and mandarins every week and trades them for household items like flour and sugar. Barters Clubs boomed in Argentina following the country's 2001 economic meltdown when jobs, security and cash were scarce. Club officials say during 2002 more than 2 million people participated in the clubs on a regular basis. In recent years, as Argentina's economy bounced back, fewer people showed up, but ever since the global financial crisis hit last year, they say the barter clubs are more popular than ever.  Watch how the clubs are helping poor Argentines » . ""It's a reality now. In these past few months there has been a big increase. For example, we now have 400 people every Saturday. It used to only be 300. People are traveling here from other neighborhoods so they can barter too,"" says Juan Maccarone, president of the La Matanza Barter Club. Nelly Vasquez, 29, goes to the club because she has no other options. She lost her job at a clothing factory last year, and has been going to the barter club every week since January -- often with her six-month-old daughter, Antonella, in tow. ""I come here because I don't have a job, and this is the only way for me to survive and get the things that I need,"" says Vasquez, who trades wool and women's shoes for pasta and rice. For others, the barter clubs offer something that every consumer on a budget seeks: a bargain. ""If you go to the supermarket, they charge 10 or 15 pesos for a bottle of cooking oil. Here, I can get it with 50 or 80 club credits. That's only 4 or 5 pesos -- that's a big difference,"" says Maria Rosa Araya, 37. By all accounts, Argentina was the first Latin American country to have the barter clubs. The idea has now spread to other countries, like Uruguay, Colombia and Venezuela. There's even a burgeoning barter club circuit across the Atlantic Ocean in Spain. Organizers say barter clubs are evidence that in tough times, economies can thrive -- or survive -- on their own, when it's the people calling the shots. ""The golden rule at barter clubs is to offer an honest product for an honest price,"" says Ruben Ravera, co-founder of Argentina's Red Global de Trueque (Global Barter Network). ""It's a concept that could help solve the world's economic problems. Think about it,"" he says.","Barter clubs opening around Argentina show extent of country's economic crisis .

"The man accused of kidnapping 16-year-old Hannah Anderson and murdering her mother and brother was killed on Saturday, bringing to an end a manhunt that spanned from California to Idaho, authorities said. James Lee DiMaggio, 40, was shot and killed by an FBI agent following what was described as a ""confrontation"" near Morehead Lake, according to authorities. Hannah was found alive, and she was taken to an area hospital for an evaluation, authorities said. Here's a look at the timeline of the case: . Saturday, August 3 . Hannah is last seen at cheerleading practice near her home in San Diego County. Sunday, August 4 . Authorities in Southern California issue a statewide Amber Alert via cell phone for Hannah and her 8-year-old brother, Ethan, after they are reported missing by their grandparents, the same day DiMaggio's home was burned. While extinguishing the house fire, personnel discover the body of the children's mother, Christina Anderson, 42, of Lakeside, California. They also recover the badly burned remains of a child and the body of a dog. Monday, August 5 . The San Diego County Sheriff's Office releases several photos of DiMaggio, saying they believe he is driving a blue, four-door Nissan Versa with California license plate 6WCU986. Tuesday, August 6 . Hannah's father, Brett Anderson, pleads for DiMaggio to release his daughter. ""Jim, I can't fathom what you were thinking. The damage is done. I'm begging you to let my daughter go. You've taken everything else,"" he tells reporters. ""Hannah, we all love you very much. If you have a chance, you take it, you run. You'll be found."" Anderson does not mention Ethan in his remarks, prompting a reporter to ask San Diego Sheriff's Department Lt. Glenn Giannantonio whether the child's remains might be those of the boy. Giannantonio says the remains have not been identified. Wednesday, August 7 . The search for DiMaggio expands from California to other states as tips pour in to San Diego authorities with possible sightings of DiMaggio, Hannah and Ethan. An Amber Alert is issued in Oregon after a possible sighting of DiMaggio's vehicle, the Oregon State Police said. Thursday, August 8 . Authorities announce DiMaggio's car has been found after a man on horseback reported he had a brief conversation with two campers in the Idaho wilderness on Wednesday. The horseback rider told investigators he struck up a brief conversation with Hannah and DiMaggio, who he did not know were being sought until later when he saw a news report about the missing girl and called the Amber Alert tip line. Friday, August 9 . San Diego authorities formally confirm the remains of the child found inside the burned out home were those of Ethan. DiMaggio's car is discovered in a rugged mountain area in central Idaho. The car was hidden by brush and the license plates removed. About 250 law enforcement personnel -- among them about 150 FBI agents, in addition to state, county and other federal agents -- converge on the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, about 15 miles outside Cascade, Idaho, looking for the teenage girl and DiMaggio. Saturday, August 10 . Authorities say they spotted the campsite being used by DiMaggio from the air. They sent in law enforcement personnel on foot, San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore tells reporters. An FBI tactical agent killed DiMaggio at about 5:15 p.m. local time during a confrontation near Morehead Lake, the sheriff says. Hannah has been found alive and taken to an area hospital for an evaluation, he says.","On Saturday,16-year-old Hannah Anderson was found and is safe, authorities say .

"When Apple unveiled not one but two new iPhones last month, it was the dawning of a new strategy for the company, which for six years had championed its single iconic smartphone even as competitors rolled out an array of shapes, sizes and features. But a month later, there are questions about how effective this strategy has been, particularly in regards to the iPhone 5C, the cheaper, colorful plastic counterpart to Apple's higher-end iPhone 5S. Though some observers see a long game in which the ""fun"" version of the iPhone will still prove popular, others are skeptical, based on some early signs. Apple has not released figures breaking down sales of the 5C versus the 5S (An earnings report on October 28 may change that). But independent analysts estimate that the fancier 5S is outselling its candy-colored cousin by 3 to 1 or, in some cases, even more. Localytics, an analytics and marketing platform creators say samples apps on 1 billion devices, says the 5S is winning 3-to-1 in the United States and a whopping 5-to-1 (72% to 28%) worldwide. Reports from generally reliable sources in China say Apple has cut production of the phone there, less than a month after it went on sale. C Tech, a Chinese site that ran accurate photos of the iPhone 5C and 5S before they were released, quotes insiders who say daily production of the 5C has been cut in half -- from 300,000 to 150,000. Part of the problem, some analysts say, is the price. Although the iPhone 5C starts at $99 with a mobile data plan, many had predicted that it would need to be even cheaper to appeal to buyers in emerging markets like China and India. In China, where phones aren't subsidized by mobile carriers, the 5C is selling for 3,500 yuan, or about $560. And though its style is all new, the 5C doesn't sport features significantly upgraded from the iPhone 5, which can be  had for as low as $199. The two-year-old iPhone 4S can be had for free with a data plan. Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst with Forrester Research, says that selling the more expensive 5S, which starts at $199, is good for Apple's bottom line in the short term. ""But in the longer term,"" she said, ""it's bad news. ""Apple needs new customers to keep growing, and the 5C was supposed to appeal to a new, more price-conscious consumer,"" she said. ""Turns out that acquisition is a lot harder than retention."" Some retailers have responded by slashing prices on the 5C. This month, Best Buy ran a promotion offering the phone for $50. Walmart has discounted it to $45 through the holidays, and Radio Shack is giving customers who buy one $50 gift cards through early next month. But some say it's not quite time to write the phone's obituary. ""Rumours on order cuts (or increases) from parts of Apple's supply chain tell us absolutely nothing either way,"" Benedict Evans, an independent analyst, wrote recently on Twitter. ""Too many moving parts."" In another post, he made light of people comparing iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C sales as an indicator of Apple's success. ""iPhone 5S outselling 5C? Apple's growth strategy a failure. Sell!"" he wrote. ""iPhone 5C outselling 5S? Cannibalisation and (revenue per user) collapse. Sell!"" This year, Apple CEO Tim Cook himself downplayed the amount of weight observers should place in supply-chain rumors. ""I suggest it's good to question the accuracy of any kind of rumor about build plans,"" Cook said during an earnings call. ""The supply chain is very complex, and we have multiple sources for things. ... There is an inordinate long list of things that can make any single data point not a great proxy for what is going on."" And there is something to be said for your top-end phone leading the way. The iPhone 5S has hit the streets to almost universally high marks from both reviewers and users. Apple announced last month that first-weekend sales of both phones combined topped 9 million, a record for the company. Still, Apple does nothing accidentally. The iPhone 5C clearly was released to appeal to customers in a way that the iPhone 5S couldn't. Only time will tell whether Apple will succeed, but it will need to see improvements before it does. ""Apple has more work to do to attract the next generation of iPhone customers,"" Epps said. ""The 5C isn't resonating as Apple hoped it would.""","Analysts expected the iPhone 5C to appeal to customers with its low price .
But, especially in emerging markets, it hasn't been significantly discounted .
Reports say production has slowed, and retailers are slashing its price .
But some observers say it's way too early to predict success or failure ."
"Alexa Meade combines painting, photography and patience to manipulate viewers' perceptions and create visual riddles by meticulously covering her subjects, and their environments, in thick strokes of paint until they resemble actual paintings. The idea came to her following a stint in politics after college, and deciding to channel the fakery and duplicity common to the political realm into something creative. ""I really got to view the political spin machine up close,"" Meade says. ""Everything before it reaches you has in some way been processed and repackaged to present a story that is fitting to somebody else's agenda. And I kind of saw this idea of taking shadows and painting them on top of themselves, taking people and painting them on top of themselves, as repackaging the same base information and turning it into something that appears completely new on the surface. But deep down is the same person; it's the same message, but with my veneer of reinterpretation on top of it."" Read more: Watch Bitcoin become a financial battlefield in these amazing charts . Using the colors and values of her subjects as a guide, Meade paints them, deftly overwriting the natural visual cues that give them their depth and form. The striking result is like someone wearing a costume of themselves. She's played with several variations on the theme, blending her subjects into street art, bathtubs full of milk, interactive installations, even photographing one's travels on the DC subway system after being painted. It's an effective optical illusion that often creates great results, but Meade--who isn't a trained painter--is motivated less by representing life than by getting people to question what they're seeing. ""There are a lot of things in this world that we take as a complete given,"" she says, ""But we don't necessarily stop to take that step to think, 'OK, well what is actually underlying all of this?'"" This isn't an entirely new concept. Boo Ritson painted her subjects in a similar fashion in the middle of the last decade, albeit in a flatter style and with a reduced color palette. Something about Meade's approach resonated with viewers, though, and her experiments went viral. Read more: Say goodbye to the iPod classic . Beyond broadly representing their subjects, Meade's pictures reflect her excitement about articulating ideas. She's more likely to invoke Borges or Plato than Rembrandt or Duchamp when discussing her work. Meade found her artistic path shortly after earning her degree in political science and working on Barack Obama's 2008 campaign. She quickly found herself intrigued by shadows and what they represent. Painting over the shadows cast by people, objects, fences on blades of grass, eventually she was painting more than just the shadows and seeing an allegory in painting reality on itself. ""I wanted to find a way to capture them and give this intangible absence of shape form and color — not all the shadows I paint are black. They're all sorts of different colors. So that evolved into painting shadows onto people, and all of a sudden I was turning people into paintings without even realizing it."" Read more on WIRED: .

"An election-year showdown over a Democratic priority -- raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour -- saw Senate Republicans block the measure on Wednesday, unleashing a torrent of criticism from President Barack Obama and his party. The measure failed to get the 60 votes needed to open debate in the 100-seat Senate, with only one Republican joining majority Democrats in an unsuccessful effort to overcome the GOP filibuster. While another vote on the proposal is possible, Obama and Democrats quickly sought to exploit the measure's initial stumble into political capital for November's congressional elections. ""If your member of Congress doesn't support raising the minimum wage, you have to let them know they are out of step and if they keep putting politics ahead of working Americans, you will put them out of office,"" the President told a White House event that focused on the matter. Minimum wage state by state . Republicans argue raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would damage the nation's fragile economic recovery.  Several GOP lawmakers took note of fresh data released Wednesday indicating the economy grew at a sluggish 0.1% in the first quarter of 2014. ""They seem to think they can coast on talking points and stale ideas â€” and that the American people haven't been paying attention to their recent dismal record at actually helping the people they claim to care about,"" said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. However, Senate Democrats argued the GOP position hurt American workers struggling to make ends meet. ""Their vote today defines their priorities,"" Sen. Patty Murray of Washington said of Republicans. ""It is the equivalent of looking American women in the eye and telling them they don't deserve a living wage. It is telling our middle-class families they don't deserve a fair shot."" Minimum wage: Congress stalls, states act . Even if the Senate moved ahead with the legislation, there was little chance the House, which is led by Republicans, would take it up. Obama and Democrats noted that polls show a strong majority of Americans support raising the minimum wage, which currently stands at $7.25. At the same time, polls indicate Democrats have little chance of winning back control of the House in November and could lose their majority in the Senate. After Wednesday's vote, Democratic senators sought to use the defeat as a rallying cry for November. ""Low-income people tend not to vote, but on this, this would be one that they come out on because it's a pocketbook issue for them,"" said liberal Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa. Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York noted that traditionally conservative states like Arkansas and Alaska have put a minimum-wage increase on their ballots ""to help bring out the vote."" 2014: What's at stake . Republican senators this week telegraphed their opposition to the minimum wage proposal, with some saying the Democratic plan was too expensive and would lead to significant job losses if businesses were forced to adopt it. ""It's too high, too fast,"" said Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who favors a smaller increase like the one adopted in his state. Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, also said she supports a reasonable increase and complained that Democrats sought to force the higher figure through without compromise or debate. ""I think it speaks to what's wrong with Washington today -- that we're placed in a situation where it was 'take it or leave it' rather than trying to come together and offer amendments and offer a level that might be acceptable,"" Collins said after the vote. Harkin, however, said the $10.10 figure sought by Democrats was needed to lift people out of poverty. ""We will not compromise on $10.10. That just gets us above the poverty level,"" he said. ""Anyone who wants to go below that is saying that a hard-working American who works full-time all year long still will live in poverty. It's time to get beyond that."" 2014: The battle for the Senate . In February, Obama signed an executive order raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour for federal contractors beginning in 2015. The measure voted on Wednesday sought to make that figure the federal minimum wage. The lone Republican to vote with Democrats was Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, who said he wants changes in the measure even though he supported bringing it up for debate. Meanwhile, Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor, who is facing a challenging re-election in conservative Arkansas, supports a smaller increase that is under consideration in his state. Pryor missed Wednesday's vote because he was back in Arkansas dealing with this week's storm damage. Key races to watch . Republicans argued the liberal agenda pushed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada could hurt centrist Democrats this fall. ""For the Democrats here in the Senate, particularly the vulnerable ones who are in tough competitive races, they've got to be particularly sensitive to the agenda the Democrats are driving,"" Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, a GOP leader, said this week. ""I think there are a lot of Democrats, on minimum wage even, that are concerned about its impact on the economy."" Recent national polls indicated that a strong majority of Americans support raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. The most recent survey, conducted early last month by Bloomberg, put that support at 69%. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released Tuesday indicated that by a 49%-33% margin, Americans say that the Democratic Party is closer to their views on the issue than the GOP. And by a two-to-one margin, voters nationwide questioned earlier this month in a Quinnipiac University poll said they would be more likely than less likely to vote for a candidate who supports raising the minimum wage. Meanwhile, national polls suggested Republicans have an enthusiasm edge over Democrats six months before the November vote. According to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday, 45% of registered voters say they want the November elections to result in a Republican-controlled Congress, with an equal amount saying they'd like to see Democrats in control on Capitol Hill. But among voters with the highest interest in the midterms, the GOP holds a 15-percentage point lead (53%-38%) over the Democrats on the question of which party should control Congress. A CBS News poll conducted late last month showed that 75% of registered Republican voters questioned said they were very or somewhat excited about voting in November, compared to 58% of Democrats. Also, 81% of registered Republicans said they'll definitely vote in November, compared to 68% of registered Democrats. The surveys seem to back up the conventional wisdom that the GOP has an advantage over the Democrats in midterm contests. White voters and older voters, key to the Republican base, tend to cast ballots in bigger percentages in midterms than younger voters and minorities, who are an important part of the Democrats' base. Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate, including two independents who caucus with the party, but are defending 21 of the 36 seats contested in November. Half of those Democratic-held seats are in traditionally conservative states or those considered purple -- leaning neither right or left. In the House, Democrats need to pick up 17 GOP-held seats to win back control of the Republican-led chamber, a feat political handicappers say is unlikely considering the shrinking number of competitive congressional districts.

"The charges against singer Chris Brown and his bodyguard stemming from a weekend fight were reduced to simple assault misdemeanors Monday. The two men, who had spent the previous 36 hours in a Washington jail, entered a packed courtroom in leg irons and handcuffs, but at the end they were unshackled and released without bail Monday afternoon. Brown, 24, was ordered to report to his California probation officer within 48 hours and to stay at least 100 yards away from the man he is accused of assaulting early Sunday.  Both men must return to court on November 24. ""Christopher Brown committed no crime,"" his attorney Danny Onorato told reporters after the hearing. ""We understand that his security acted to protect Mr. Brown and his property, as he is authorized to do under District of Columbia law. We are confident that Mr. Brown will be exonerated of any wrongdoing."" He and bodyguard Christopher Hollosy had been facing felony assault charges, the Washington Metropolitan Police Department said. The arrest could have serious legal consequences for Brown because he is on probation for the felony domestic violence conviction relating to his 2009 attack on former girlfriend Rihanna. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office is not commenting Monday about Brown's arrest, but prosecutors have been aggressive in the past year in monitoring Brown's compliance with rules of his California probation. They have twice filed probation violation charges against the singer this year, resulting in an additional 1,000 hours of community labor being added to his sentence for beating Rihanna. The next step in Los Angeles is for Brown's probation officer to prepare a report on the arrest for Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin, who had already ordered Brown to appear in his court on November 20 for a probation status hearing. Police say Brown and Hollosy attacked a man with their fists outside the W Hotel in downtown Washington at 4:25 a.m. Sunday. A police incident report obtained by CNN identified the alleged victim as Isaac Adams Parker, 20, of Beltsville, Maryland. Parker did not respond to a CNN call for comment. Parker told police that he tried to jump into a photo that Brown was posing for with a female fan on the sidewalk when the singer said, ""I'm not down with that gay s--t"" and ""I feel like boxing,"" the police report said. Parker said that Brown then punched him in the face with his closed fist, the report said. Parker said Brown's bodyguard -- who stands 6-foot-5 and weighs 240 pounds -- stepped between them and punched Parker in the face, the report said. The bodyguard then grabbed Brown by his arm and pulled him toward his tour bus, which was parked nearby, it said. Brown and the bodyguard were taken into custody and were being held at the Second District police station, police said. Both men were later transferred to a central jail cell block for processing, police said, . Parker was treated for a bruised and swollen face at a hospital and released, police spokesman Anthony Clay told CNN. Brown was in Washington to host a ""homecoming party"" at The Park at Fourteen nightclub Saturday night, according to his Twitter feed, just four blocks away from where he was arrested Sunday morning. His representative and lawyer did not respond to CNN calls for comment Sunday. In August: Brown ordered to 1,000 hours community labor . Brown was arrested in February 2009 for punching Rihanna inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street. The altercation left the face of Rihanna, also a chart-topping singer, bruised and bloody on the eve of the Grammy Awards. He entered a guilty plea seven months later and was sentenced to serve five years of probation and ordered to spend more than 1,400 hours in ""labor-oriented service."" His probation reports were glowing until the past year, when the district attorney's office accused him of not completing the 1,400 hours of community labor, which he was allowed to do in his home state of Virginia. Brown calls out Jay-Z in new interview . He was also accused of hit-and-run after a minor traffic crash this year. The driver of the other car told investigators that Brown ""went ballistic"" and screamed at her after his Range Rover rear-ended her Mercedes on a Los Angeles street. In August, Brown's lawyer reached a settlement with prosecutors to end their efforts to revoke his probation. The deal called for Brown to complete another 1,000 hours of community service. Probation rules require Brown to stay out of all legal trouble. Even an arrest that does not lead to a conviction could result in a probation violation charge.

"(CNN) -- Conservative groups on Monday filed a lawsuit in New York Supreme Court challenging the legality of the state's same-sex marriage law. The lawsuit, in which New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedom (NYCF) is the primary plaintiff, seeks an injunction on the Marriage Equality Act, claiming that open meeting laws were violated, campaign contributions were promised, and Senate rules on debate were violated in order to enact the law, which took effect on Sunday. In statements issued Monday, NYCF and Liberty Counsel, the nonprofit legal firm representing them, claimed that: . -- New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg held a closed-door session with all Republican senators, ""in violation of the Open Meetings Law,"" in which he pressured them to vote in favor of the act. -- Bloomberg promised to make large campaign contributions to any GOP senator who voted in favor of the bill. -- Gov. Andrew Cuomo violated the constitutionally mandated three-day review period before a vote was taken ""by unjustifiably issuing a message of necessity."" -- Lobbyists and the public were shut out from the Senate lobby and ""denied access to elected representatives,"" an act the groups said was unprecedented. ""Today we are asking the court to intervene in its rightful role as the check and balance on an out-of-control state legislature,"" said the Rev. Jason J. McGuire, NYCF's executive director. ""It is unfortunate that state senators chose to protect their personal interests, rather than the people they were elected to represent,"" McGuire said in a statement. ""Some of the players may have changed, but it looks like same old Albany game. It is time the curtain be pulled back and the disinfecting light of good government shine upon the Cuomo administration and our state legislature.""

"Situated where the Philippines meets the Pacific Ocean, Guiuan had the look and feel of a tropical paradise -- replete with surf camps, resorts and pristine white beaches. Its location on Samar Island's southeastern tip, in many ways, had been Guiuan's greatest blessing. And now? It could be seen as its greatest curse. When Super Typhoon Haiyan came ashore early Friday -- bringing sustained winds of 315 kph (195 mph) and gusts as strong as 380 kph (235 mph) -- it did so in Guiuan. Buildings collapsed, palm trees snapped, shelters ceased to be. And with devastation came desperate needs for, as one Guiuan put it, ""food, tents, everything."" As he noted: ""Everything is gone."" Guiuan was cut off from outside communication and many basic necessities until recently, when a C-130 military cargo plane flew over the ravaged area and landed at its small airport. The aircraft's cargo bay was packed with supplies and Filipino troops. Once there, where should they start to help? That's hard to say, admits Guiuan Mayor Christopher Gonzales, given the scale of what's happened. Almost all of his community's 50,000 people are now homeless, thanks to Haiyan. ""If you want to look at our municipality,"" Gonzales said, ""it's total damage; 100% damage."" The troops don't waste any time, quickly unloading drinking water and bags of rice, as residents watch from a safe distance. Some troops stay to participate in search-and-rescue operations in a place where the death toll is still far from settled. Within 20 minutes, the C-130 is back buzzing again. Its new load includes some people hurt by the storm, some with spinal injuries. Other more able-bodied people have found seats, hoping to get far from the misery that is likely to forever be associated with a place that many had considered paradise.","Super Typhoon Haiyan came ashore in Guiuan in the eastern Philippines .

"Technical problems with the federally facilitated health insurance exchange were caused by a specific software component that crashed under the high volume of visitors last week, preventing users from creating accounts in the beginning stages of the enrollment process, a federal official confirmed to CNN on Tuesday. ""At lower volumes, this software component would work fine, and at higher volume, that's what created the problems,"" the official said. ""We've made software changes to make the system more efficient and be able to handle higher volumes."" For more than a week, visitors to Healthcare.gov have experienced slow connection speeds and error messages preventing them from purchasing insurance. The Department of Health and Human Services has been taking down parts of the site during off-peak hours, and officials say that adding more server capacity; moving certain over-stressed components to dedicated hardware; and making software changes to increase efficiency have improved the situation. On Monday, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Comedy Central's Jon Stewart that despite the hiccups, hundreds of thousands of consumers have created accounts on the federal site, but the government won't announce how many of those users have actually purchased insurance until next month. The government has been assisted in building and maintaining Healthcare.gov primarily by contractor CGI-Federal. As of March, the contractor had collected nearly $90 million from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, according to a report issued in June by the Government Accountability Office. ""We have a unique, cross-sector perspective on health IT that makes us well-suited to partner with CMS for success on one of the most visible efforts in CMS history,"" CGI Vice President Rich Martin said in a December 2011 statement announcing the contract, the original value of which was more than $55 million. As part of Obamacare implementation, CGI is also performing exchange work in California, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Kentucky, New Mexico and Vermont, according to the company's website. A Canadian company with a global presence, CGI presents itself as the world's fifth largest independent IT and business process services company. The company has experience in health care IT as a partner to some of the Canadian Ministries of Health and as a provider of secure electronic medical records in Europe. Its U.S. government contracting branch, CGI-Federal, has done more than $2.5 billion in business with more than two dozen government agencies since 2001, according to a search at USASpending.gov. This work includes nearly a billion dollars of work with HHS, costly projects for the defense and intelligence industry, as well as contracts worth potentially billions of dollars supporting the U.S. Army, Navy and Marine Corps. Career operations staff at both HHS and CMS managed the company's work, as well as the work of Quality Software Services, Inc., a separate contractor that has received about $55 million from CMS to build the federal data hub. According to government officials, that data hub and the various levels of identity verification necessary for enrollment are working properly, providing accurate eligibility results and tax credit determinations. The problems have been centered in the website's front-end, or Healthcare.gov's consumer-facing side. An analysis of this front-end performed by leading web-hosting company Media Temple for the Wall Street Journal and provided to CNN found that the designers failed to follow basic protocols for high-traffic sites. Six of Media Temple's high-level engineers point to the site's structure rather than web traffic as the primary problem. The faults they identified include out-of-date web applications; poorly written code; lines of testing code left in the final product; and unnecessary or unchanging information sent to users on each login rather than stored on local servers or computers for quicker access, a process called caching. ""We're in the business of fast websites that don't fail, that's what we do,"" said Media Temple President and COO Russ Reeder. ""And so when I had my engineers look at the web site, they came up with a lot of things that they could have done better. If this is so important and they've gotten paid so much money -- the consulting firm CGI, $55 million for this project  where's the oversight? Where's the technical leadership saying, 'tell me how you tested this and how do we make sure that this is not only secure but it won't fail when we have 7 million people log in?' "" Government officials wouldn't comment on which parts of Healthcare.gov were built by CGI and which parts were built by the government. CGI didn't return requests for comment.","Software problems caused Healthcare.gov glitches, U.S. official says .

"For many victims, California's new ""revenge porn"" law doesn't go far enough. Revenge porn, also called cyber revenge, is the act of posting sexual photos of an ex-lover online for vengeance. The photos were typically exchanged consensually over the course of a relationship and meant only for the other person. There are websites dedicated to posting and making money off of these types of shots, which are primarily of women. The new California law, which was signed into law on Tuesday by Gov. Jerry Brown, is only the second revenge porn-specific piece of legislation in the United States. Under the law, people convicted of distributing sexual images of exes face six months of jail time and a $1,000 fine. Critics say the law has some glaring loopholes. It only applies when the person accused of spreading the images online is also the photographer. It does not cover photos a person takes of themselves and shares with a lover, say during a sexting session. Up to 80% of revenge porn victims had taken the photos of themselves, according to a recent survey by the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative. CCRI is a group founded by revenge porn victims and activists to push for legal reform in the United States. That means the vast majority of revenge porn cases would not qualify under this law. ""I definitely don't think this bill goes far enough, though it is a step in the right direction,"" said CCRI's Holly Jacobs, who became a prominent anti-revenge porn activist after she was a victim herself. In Jacobs' case, most of her photos posted online were self-shots but some were taken by her ex. ""We would only have been able to follow through with the charges if we linked his IP address to the pictures that he took of me, not those that I took of myself,"" said Jacobs. Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at Miami Law School who is on the board at CCRI, said one of the possible reasons the law did not include self-shots is that the distinction was required so people who sent unsolicited nude photos of themselves were not covered. However, the law does specifically state that photos be taken ""under circumstances where the parties agree or understand that the image shall remain private."" ""I think we are really looking at a 'blame the victim' mentality here,"" said Franks, meaning people who take the photos of themselves were ""asking for it."" ""It's disturbing that the drafters apparently think that some victims of nonconsensual pornography are not worth protecting,"" said Franks. Another issue is that there could be difficulty enforcing the law even in cases that do qualify. The law applies to people who post photos to ""harass or annoy"" and the perpetrators must have ""intent to cause serious emotional distress."" That could exclude people who post these types of images only for financial gain or other reasons like bragging rights. The sites that make money off of submitted revenge porn might be able to avoid prosecution by claiming they did not know the victims and therefore couldn't have intended any harm. ""Until now, there was no tool for law enforcement to protect victims,"" California state Sen. Anthony Cannella said in a statement. Cannella was one of the main authors of the new law. ""Too many have had their lives upended because of an action of another that they trusted."" Cannella's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding criticisms of the law. Previously, victims of revenge porn had limited recourse when photos taken with consent were posted online. A person could sue the ex who uploaded the images or the site hosting them for invasion of privacy, but it didn't constitute harassment under California state laws. Victims would have had to pay for a costly civil suit. California is only the second state to have a law that addresses revenge porn. New Jersey has had a related law since 2003 that makes it a felony to post secretly recorded videos or photos online. Now other states are considering their own revenge porn laws, including New York and Wisconsin. Franks has been working with both states on early drafts of their laws, and she says that so far it looks like both avoid what she considers the weaknesses of the California law and include First Amendment protections. Activists would also like to see a federal law address revenge porn. Early on, the ACLU voiced concerns about the California law's potentially negative impact on free speech, for example, if someone wanted to share a photo that had political implications or if a photo or video contained evidence of a crime. Florida was considering a revenge porn law but scrapped it following First Amendment concerns. The California bill contains an urgency clause, meaning it will go into effect immediately. The first few cases will show how effective the new legislation is in curbing revenge porn. Since it's nearly impossible to scrub an image from the Internet once it has gone viral, the best possible outcome is that the law discourages people from seeking this type of revenge in the first place.","California has passed a new law making ""revenge porn"" illegal .
The law does not apply to self-shot photos that are shared during a relationship .
Critics say the law does not go far enough to protect victims .

"New York (CNN) -- Competitive eater Joey ""Jaws"" Chestnut proved himself the official top dog of the hot dog-eating world when he ate 62 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes at the annual Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest on Monday, but his archnemesis Takeru Kobayashi crushed Chestnut's world record at an off-site event where he pounded down 69 hot dogs and buns. For the fifth year in a row, Chestnut beat the 17-man field at the 96th annual Major League Eating event at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York. Kobayashi, who has been banned from the contest due to a contract dispute with Major League Eating, competed from afar: on the roof of a Manhattan bar, in unison with Chestnut and his fellow competitors. Kobayashi polished off 69 hot dogs and buns to the tune of a crowd chanting ""Kobi! Kobi!"" and the official Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest playing on a television beside him. He beat Chestnut's 2009 world record of 68 hot dogs and buns. But Chestnut brushed off the feat since Kobayashi was miles away from the cheering crowds in Brooklyn. ""It wasn't a competition,"" he said. ""It was no different than what I do at practice on my own and I'm able to break a record at my house,"" Chestnut added. Event organizers agree, arguing that the record is not official if it's not broken at Coney Island. ""I don't know if it was a magic show or an eating contest,"" said Richard Shea, president of Major League Eating. ""Not having been there, it seems like a bit of a farce. The hot dog eating contest is on Coney Island."" Major League Eating will not recognize Kobayashi's 69 hot dogs as a new world record, Shea said. Kobayashi, who gained 18 pounds during the contest, said his makeshift competition was to remind the world ""that I'm still good, that I'm still in the contest,"" he said through an interpreter. ""During practice, I had already broken the record, so I had enough confidence that I could beat that,"" he added. Kobayashi took home six consecutive Nathan's contest titles from 2001 to 2006. Last year, he was arrested after rushing the stage at the Coney Island event. But Chestnut remains the official champion, and he will share his official title with Sonya ""The Black Widow"" Thomas, who devoured 40 hot dogs and buns to beat eight other eaters in the first women's Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest. Thomas missed her own personal record by just one hot dog. Event organizers split the contest into female and male competitions this year to give the ever-expanding female field of competitors a chance at the big prize. Both Chestnut and Thomas were awarded $10,000. Chestnut took home the contest's signature Mustard belt -- a yellow championship belt -- while Thomas was the first recipient of a pink belt, meant to promote event sponsor Pepto Bismol.","Joey Chestnut wins Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, eating 62 hot dogs and buns .

"(CNN) -- Fighting flared for a third straight day Sunday along the Thai-Cambodian border over a disputed ancient temple despite a reported ceasefire and international efforts to soothe tensions. At least seven people -- two villagers and five soldiers -- were wounded after a new gunfight broke out shortly before 7 p.m. Sunday evening, Thai Army spokesman Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd told his nation's state-run MCOT media outlet. The skirmish came a day after the two sides agreed to a ceasefire, according to the official Thai report. Earlier, Thai Army Lt. Gen. Thawatchai Samutsakorn told MCOT that the situation along the border was returning to normal Sunday. Several shops in the Kantharalak district reopened earlier Sunday, and some villagers had gone back to their homes -- though the later report noted that residents were evacuated again to temporary bunkers. Twenty schools planned to remain shuttered through at least Wednesday on the government's orders. The clashes stem from a longstanding conflict related to the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. The building sits on a cliff in Cambodian territory, but the most accessible entrance to the site is on the Thai side. Gunfire erupted Friday near the site, followed by more skirmishes Saturday. A Thai Army spokesman said one soldier was killed Saturday, and four others were injured. Earlier, the country's health minister told the MCOT news agency that one Thai villager was killed by artillery shells fired by Cambodian troops. A Cambodian official, who was not named, said 10 of its soldiers and civilians were killed or injured in Friday and Saturday fighting, state-run Cambodian news outlet AKP reported. The official said Cambodian authorities had also captured five Thai troops, including four on Friday. The United Nations weighed in on the dispute Sunday, with a statement from Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's press office saying he is ""deeply concerned"" by the clashes. The world body's leader urged discussion over military confrontations, in ""a spirit of dialogue and good neighborly relations."" ""The Secretary-General appeals to both sides to put in place effective arrangements for cessation of hostilities and to exercise maximum restraint,"" the U.N. statement said. ""The United Nations remains at their disposal to assist in these peaceful efforts."" On Saturday, Cambodia had formally complained in a letter to the U.N. about what it described as ""intense shelling"" with mortar rounds Saturday morning following an alleged armed incursion by Thai troops on Friday, according to state-run AKP news. In the letter, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen pointed to the ""explosive situation at the border,"" alleging that 300 Thai troops on Friday ""entered Cambodian territory and attacked Cambodian troops at three locations"" about 500 meters (a third of a mile) from the temple. The letter also alludes to similar ""acts of aggression"" in 2008 and 2009 by Thai forces. Besides the human toll, the letter claimed that the temple itself had suffered damage in the shelling and firefights. ""Facing this flagrant aggression, Cambodian troops had no option but to retaliate in self-defense in order to safeguard Cambodia's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" the letter states. The recent Thai military actions violate the 1991 Paris Peace Accord, U.N. Charter and a 1962 judgment from the International Court of Justice, the letter claims. Thai Prime Minister Abhist Vejjajiva denied that his nation's troops had attacked Cambodian forces, telling reporters they only acted in self-defense to protect their homeland's own sovereignty, according to MCOT. That report indicated Thailand, too, had sent a letter to the United Nations about the situation. On Sunday, the Thai leader tried to downplay the need for outside intervention to resolve the dispute, including an offer from ASEAN Secretary-General Surin Pitsuwan -- Thailand's former foreign minister and now head of the southeast Asian alliance -- to mediate. The United States urged Thailand and Cambodia on Friday to show ""maximum restraint."" Events were being closely monitored, according to State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley, and both sides were called on to ""take all necessary steps to reduce tensions and avoid further conflict."" Conflict over the Preah Vihear site has taken place periodically for years. In 1962, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, ruled that the site was in Cambodia, adding that the structure was ""an outstanding masterpiece of Khmer architecture."" But Thailand says that the 1.8 square-mile (4.6 square-kilometer) area around Preah Vihear was never fully demarcated, and blames a map drawn at the beginning of the 20th century during the French occupation of Cambodia. In July 2008, the United Nations approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site -- meaning the U.N. believes the place has outstanding universal value.","A Thai official tells state-run media that seven are hurt Sunday in clashes with Cambodia .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- The Bangladeshi government has been asked to find a compromise to bring an end to the Grameen Bank crisis created by removing its founder, microcredit pioneer Muhammad Yunus. ""We remain hopeful that a compromise solution can be reached to the satisfaction of all parties,"" said Robert O. Blake, U.S. assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs, as he was wrapping up his four-day Bangladesh visit on Tuesday. Yunus ""has brought great honor to Bangladesh, and we in the United States have been deeply troubled by the difficulties he is currently facing,"" Blake said at a press conference at American Club in Dhaka. Blake said failure to achieve a compromise would have some effect on bilateral relations between the two countries. ""As a friend and partner of Bangladesh, we are concerned about the dampening effect this will have on civil society in general and on the integrity and effectiveness of Grameen Bank in particular,"" he said. ""We see it is a distraction and an unnecessary departure from all great work being done in Bangladesh,"" he said. Blake, who arrived in Dhaka on Saturday, met with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina; Khaleda Zia, leader of the opposition in Parliament; Finance Minister AMA Muhith; senior government officials, Yunus and civil society members. Earlier this month, the 70-year-old Yunus was removed from Grameen Bank, which he founded three decades ago. The Central Bank of Bangladesh, the regulatory authority in the South Asian nation, cited his age in explaining his removal as managing director. The government, which has a 25% stake in Grameen, said the bank's rules required Yunus to end his service when he turned 60. Yunus challenged the order and filed a petition with the High Court, which finally upheld the government order. Yunus and nine directors of his Grameen Bank again filed two petitions with the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court seeking a stay of the High Court order. The petitions are now pending with the Appellate Division, and the case is expected to come up for hearing by the end of March. Grameen's work cast a global spotlight on microcredit, a then-novel idea of making small loans to poor people who would not qualify for standard bank loans. For their efforts, Yunus and Grameen Bank won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. He also was awarded the American Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Congressional Gold Medal. Blake said of Yunus: ""His work over the past decades to lift millions of women out of poverty is internationally recognized."" As Blake met Hasina, also present was former World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn, one of the founders of Friends of Grameen, an international forum supporting Yunus and his Grameen Bank. He was in Dhaka on a private visit. Earlier, U.S. Senator John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, said in a statement that he was ""deeply concerned"" about the efforts to remove Yunus as managing director of the bank. ""The international community will watch this situation closely, and I hope that both sides can reach a compromise that maintains Grameen Bank's autonomy and effectiveness,"" said Kerry, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""Institutions like the Grameen Bank make a significant contribution to Bangladesh's development and democracy, and Professor Yunus' lifelong work to reduce poverty and empower women through microloans has deservedly received worldwide attention and respect,"" Kerry said. Yunus' supporters have said the government's effort to remove him has little to do with age and much to do with opposition to microcredit and Grameen's execution of it. Critics of microcredit have charged that lenders were making big money from small loans. Others have suggested that the actions against Yunus are politically motivated, a claim denied by the government. Yunus' supporters say he has been under fire for criticizing politicians and trying to form his own political party four years ago during an interim, unelected, military-backed government. That party was later abandoned.","State Department official says U.S. is ""deeply troubled"" by the situation .

"The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday declined to hear an emergency application for a stay filed by a Florida deep-sea salvage company that wanted to maintain possession of a half billion dollars worth of gold and silver coins until a final decision is made about who owns them. ""Spain has now been victorious at every level in the United States courts, from Tampa to Atlanta to Washington,"" said Jim Goold, who defended Spain's claim to the treasure. ""I am pleased and proud for all of us."" Odyssey Marine Exploration had made an emergency appeal to the high court in an attempt to block a lower court's order last week that it turn over the treasure to Spain. Justice Clarence Thomas, who has jurisdiction over applications from Florida, denied without comment the motion in Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc. v. Kingdom of Spain. The company has filed at least one another stay request with the justices. Melinda MacConnel, Odyssey's vice president and general counsel, expressed disappointment, but said she recognized that the court ""rarely grants"" such motions. ""How we proceed from here will depend on whether a mandate issues and what a subsequent order might look like, especially given the fact that the courts have determined they do not have jurisdiction in the case,"" she said in a statement. Goold said it was unlikely that the Supreme Court would review the case. ""The Supreme Court accepts 1% or less of such requests and today's decision makes a strong statement about their chances,"" he said. The dispute goes back to 2007, when Odyssey announced it had found a 19th-century sunken ship off of Spain. The company claimed ownership of the coins and said it had flown them to a guarded location in the United States. Spain filed suit in a federal court in Tampa, Florida, also claiming the treasure. Spain says its navy warship Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes was carrying the coins. The 34-gun frigate left Peru in 1804 and crossed the Atlantic to within a day's sail from Spain when British ships attacked the Spanish fleet. In the ensuing Battle of Cape St. Mary, south of Portugal, the Mercedes was hit in its powder magazine and exploded, according to the Spanish government's filing to the Florida court. In 2009, the federal court in Tampa ruled in favor of Spain and the federal appeals court in Atlanta upheld the ruling last September. Last week, the appeals court denied an Odyssey motion, which Odyssey appealed to the Supreme Court. The appeals court is expected to send the case back to the court in Tampa, which would establish and supervise the procedures for sending the coins to Spain, Goold said last week. Spain believes that most of the nearly 600,000 coins are currently in Florida, Goold said. Spain's Culture Minister, Jose Ignacio Wert, told CNN in Madrid on Wednesday that the case was never really about the money. ""We're not going to use this money for purposes other than artistic exhibition, but this is something that enriches our material, artistic capital and it has to be appreciated as such,"" Wert said in an interview. He said the coins would be exhibited at Spanish museums, and perhaps elsewhere. Peru, too, has followed the fate of the coins, which came from Latin America when Peru was a Spanish colony. ""Formally, they haven't claimed anything, but we are completely open to consider the possibility of distributing some part of the treasure also among the Latin American museums,"" Wert said. The treasure includes fabled ""pieces of eight,"" some minted in 1803 in Lima, Peru, Spanish officials have said.","Odyssey's bid to hold on to gold and silver coins was set back .

"The first confirmed Ebola patient in Mali has died, according to state TV reports, citing government health officials. The victim, a 2-year-old girl, had traveled to the country with her grandmother from Guinea -- one of the three countries hardest hit during the recent Ebola outbreak. Earlier on Friday, the World Health Organization said that the girl had multiple opportunities to expose others to the virus. The girl first went to a clinic Tuesday after entering the country, WHO Assistant Director-General Marie-Paule Kieny said at a news conference in Geneva, Switzerland. The WHO said it was working to confirm media reports that the child's mother showed Ebola-like symptoms before her death. The girl was diagnosed with Ebola in Mali on Thursday. Health Ministry spokeswoman Markatie Daou said the dozens of people who had contact with the girl have not shown any symptom related to the virus, as of Friday. More than 40 people are still being monitored, she said. They include 10 medical workers who came into contact with the girl in the city of Kayes, west of the Mali capital of Bamako, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said. Kayes has a population of about 128,000 people. He cited local authorities as saying 43 people were being monitored in total. The incubation period for Ebola is two to 21 days, so the country faces a long wait to know if it's in the clear. The young girl, whose father died of Ebola, was taken to the hospital in Kayes after a nurse noticed she was suffering from what appeared to be Ebola-like symptoms. The case makes Mali the sixth West African country to be hit by the virus, which WHO reported has killed more than 4,800 people. Nigeria and Senegal have in recent days been declared free of the disease. Complete coverage on Ebola . Ousmane Kone, Mali's minister for public health, called for people in Kayes to ""stay calm"" and observe ""hygiene measures."" He asked anyone who'd had contact with the girl to contact authorities. Extra WHO medical experts are being sent immediately to Mali to help its Ministry of Health respond, Jasarevic said. They will bolster a WHO team that was already in the country to help with general preparedness. New vaccine trials . Five more potential Ebola vaccines are to start clinical trials soon, Kieny said. Kieny also said WHO hopes that ""a few hundred thousand doses"" of Ebola vaccine will be available by the end of the first half of 2015. She refused to be more specific about numbers and emphasized that she was speaking about a hope, not a plan. The trials will involve ""several tens of thousands"" of subjects -- perhaps 20,000 to 30,000 -- she said. The beginning of the trials is being moved up to December, from January, because of a ""massive effort to make this happen,"" Kieny said. WHO is not ruling out the possibility of mass Ebola vaccinations in the first half of 2015, but three conditions would have to be met, Kieny said Friday. They are: a safe and effective vaccine would have to be found; the scale of the outbreak would have to be sufficient to justify mass vaccinations; and enough doses would have to be available for mass vaccination. Liberia has the most advanced plans for an Ebola vaccine trial, involving two vaccines and a control, Kieny said. Sierra Leone has less advanced plans, and there are currently no plans for a trial in Guinea, she said. Mali is among the countries where WHO has been planning to run vaccine trials. EU, China to boost aid . Earlier Friday, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy announced on Twitter that the European Union will increase its aid to help West Africa fight Ebola by $380 million to $1.2 billion. The EU had pledged 700 million euros, and raised its pledge to 1 billion euros. China will also boost its aid to the three West African nations at the center of the Ebola outbreak, President Xi Jinping said Friday, according to the country's Foreign Ministry. Xi said the Chinese government will provide a fourth round of assistance to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea that will include emergency funding and supplies worth an equivalent of $82 million. China will also dispatch quarantine experts and medical personnel and set up a new treatment center in Liberia, according to the Foreign Ministry. WHO eyes 'bend in the curve' Speaking at a media briefing after a meeting of a WHO emergency committee Thursday, WHO's Dr. Keiji Fukuda noted that there ""continued to be exponential increase of cases in the three countries with the most intense transmission"" -- that is, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. It remains a concern that the virus will spread beyond those areas, he said, and ""this is most likely to be done by somebody traveling."" However, he said, exit screening for those leaving hotspot countries -- which can include taking travelers' temperature, asking them to fill out a questionnaire and checking out any fever for a risk of Ebola infection -- ""probably does have a quite important deterrent effect."" He said the organization was continuing to pursue a plan to break the chain of transmission that relies on isolating 70% of Ebola cases and safely burying 70% of those who die. WHO hopes ""to begin to see a so-called bend in the curve"" by the beginning of December, he said. ""It's clear that it remains quite a challenge right now. We see the numbers still going up. We still see an extensive effort trying to catch up to that curve and then get beyond the curve, but this is what we've been targeting, and that remains true now."" WHO announced earlier this month that vaccine trials were expected to begin in West Africa in January.","2-year-old girl dies .

"Washington (CNN) -- Democrats and Republicans narrowly averted a partial shutdown of the federal government Friday night, agreeing on a budget deal and a short-term funding extension little more than an hour before the clock struck midnight and time ran out. The new funding extension, which cuts spending by $2 billion, will last through next Thursday. ""The government will be open for business,"" President Barack Obama said. ""In the final hours before our government would have been forced to shut down, leaders in both parties reached an agreement that will allow our small businesses to get the loans they need, our families to get the mortgages they applied for, and hundreds of thousands of Americans to show up at work and take home their paychecks on time."" Negotiators capped days of frantic closed-door talks and public recriminations by agreeing on a framework for a package of $38.5 billion in spending cuts covering the rest of the fiscal year, which expires September 30. Republicans, bolstered by their capture of the House of Representatives in last November's midterm elections, had initially pushed for $61 billion in cuts. Opinion: How did we get to brink of shutdown? A GOP push to strip $317 million in federal funding from Planned Parenthood failed. Democrats also turned back Republican attempts to get federal dollars currently set aside for family planning and women's health turned into block grants for states. Such a move would have given governors and state legislatures more ability to cut funding for services opposed by conservatives. Sources told CNN, however, that leaders of the Democratic-controlled Senate agreed to hold separate votes on both measures, as well as on an initiative to repeal President Barack Obama's health care overhaul. Lessons learned from past shutdowns . Obama praised the agreement, calling the cuts ""painful"" but necessary to secure the country's economic future. This ""is what the American people expect us to do,"" the president said at the White House. ""That's why they sent us here."" ""This has been a lot of discussion and a long fight,"" said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Republicans fought to ""create a better environment for job creators in our country."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, called the deal ""difficult but important for the country."" Nevertheless, the furious down-to-the-wire talks portend even tougher rounds of negotiations when Congress takes up an increase in the nation's debt ceiling and the fiscal year 2012 budget in the months ahead. If the negotiations had failed, approximately 800,000 government workers would have been furloughed. A range of government services would have come to halt. Obama noted earlier in the week that the mechanism of shutting down government operations had already started. An inability to reach a deal would have hurt federal workers, people who rely on government services and the nation's broader economic recovery, he warned. Belief Blog -- My Take: Culture war in budget battle . ""For us to go backwards because Washington couldn't get its act together is unacceptable,"" the president said. Top aides on both sides of the aisle had seemed increasingly resigned to the prospect of a shutdown. Congressional staffers began receiving their furlough notices Thursday afternoon. Friday's agreement to slash $38.5 billion in spending comes on top of two previous funding extensions that included $10 billion in cuts. Republicans, under pressure from the conservative Tea Party movement to reduce the size of government, blame Democrats for failing to pass a fiscal year 2011 budget last year when they controlled both the Senate and the House. They also say Obama and his party are ignoring the peril of rising federal deficits and the national debt. Democrats call the $61 billion in cuts initially pushed by the Republicans extreme, and argue reductions of that scale would have harmed the economic recovery while damaging education and innovation programs essential for continued growth. The budget brinkmanship showed the political stakes of the situation, with both parties trying to depict the other as unwilling to do what's right for the country. It also demonstrated the cavernous gap between the two parties on social issues. Democrats said the Republican drive to defund Planned Parenthood proves the GOP is fixated on abortion and other issues related to women's health. Republicans repeatedly insisted that the size of spending reductions was the main cause of the dispute in recent days. CNN's Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh, Ted Barrett, John King, Kate Bolduan, Brianna Keilar, Terry Frieden, Ed Henry and Dan Lothian contributed to this report.","NEW: A temporary measure will keep the government funded through next Thursday .

"A group of men who devoted their lives to hunting powerful storms died in the middle of the chase. Tim Samaras, his son Paul Samaras and Carl Young were killed Friday while following a tornado in El Reno, Oklahoma, relatives told CNN on Sunday. Their work tracking tornadoes was featured on the former Discovery Channel show ""Storm Chasers."" They were among 13 people killed in storms that struck Oklahoma on Friday night, according to Oklahoma City Fire Chief Keith Bryant. At the intersection where authorities said the three storm chasers were killed, crews hauled away a mangled white truck Sunday that had been crushed like a tin can. The metal frame of their storm-chasing vehicle was twisted almost beyond recognition. The windows had been smashed to bits. Canadian County Undersheriff Chris West confirmed that three storm chasers had been killed but declined to provide additional details about the circumstances of their deaths. ""We also want to say that storm chasers and meteorologists and news stations, that's part of the vital link in getting the word out to people so that they don't become victims,"" he said. ""A lot of these individuals have dedicated many years of their lives to going out and assisting and tracking storms, and getting footage and putting themselves in harm's way so they can educate the public to the destructive power of these storms."" Friday's tornado took a sudden turn that surprised many observers, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. ""It was a wobbler. And it was big. ... I think the left-hand turn made a big difference on how this thing was chased as well and why people were killed and why people were injured in their vehicles,"" he said. ""A vehicle is not a place to be in any tornado, especially a big one like that, and those men doing their job, those field scientists out there doing their jobs, were killed in the process."" Tim Samaras founded TWISTEX, the Tactical Weather Instrumented Sampling in Tornadoes Experiment, to help learn more about tornadoes and increase lead time for warnings, according to the official website. In 2004, he told CNN that being near storms was part of the job. ""In order to get directly in the path, you have to be close,"" he said. ""Actually I'm pretty focused on our safety, certainly, and I'm focused on getting the data and getting the right spot,"" he said. ""You only have one chance to do it."" A dangerous job . ""They all unfortunately passed away but doing what they loved,"" Jim Samaras wrote in a statement posted on his brother's Facebook page. Myers, who also covered Friday's storm in Oklahoma, said Tim Samaras was known for his attention to safety. ""There's just no one safer than Tim. Tim, he would never put himself in danger,"" Myers said. ""He certainly wouldn't put his son in danger."" One of Samaras' goals, Myers said, was collecting more data to help government officials. ""We all know that this is difficult and dangerous and sometimes things go wrong. But I think to portray Tim as just a chaser out for a thrill is just the wrong thing,"" Myers said. ""I just want people to know that Tim was a scientist. He was out there to put probes out there. He was out there to learn and understand and to make science more understandable. ... We all go out there and we try to protect the public, but Tim was even one step higher."" Samaras had received 18 grants from the National Geographic Society for his research, said Terry Garcia, the organization's executive vice president of missions. In a written statement, he described Samaras' studies of lightning as ""pioneering."" ""Tim was a courageous and brilliant scientist who fearlessly pursued tornadoes and lightning in the field in an effort to better understand these phenomena,"" he said. ""Though we sometimes take it for granted, Tim's death is a stark reminder of the risks encountered regularly by the men and women who work for us,"" Garcia said. ""This is an enormous loss for his family, his wide circle of friends and colleagues and National Geographic."" Doug Kiesling, a videographer who chases storms and calls himself ""The Weather Paparazzi,"" said the three men were more than storm chasers. ""They're researchers,"" he said. ""This thing is really shaking up everyone in the chasing community,"" he said. ""We knew this day would happen someday, but nobody would imagine that it would happen to Tim. Tim was one of the safest people to go out there. ... He's had close calls, but he's always had an escape route."" El Reno Mayor Matt White didn't provide details about those killed after the tornado struck, but he stressed the importance of staying indoors when powerful storms hit. ""We had to deal with not only strong winds, but we had extreme hail, extreme softball-size hail. El Reno had a lot of damage to the roads,"" he told reporters on Sunday. ""In these situations, we can't stress enough to people to stay inside and do what the weather men and women tell us to do."" Close call: One storm chaser's story . Friday's storm was particularly unpredictable, according to Mike Bettes, an anchor and meteorologist for The Weather Channel who had a close call himself. The tornado swept up the tornado-hunt truck he and a crew were traveling in, tossed it 200 yards into a field and smashed it to the ground. ""I think this was just an erratic tornado. I think the size of it and the speed of it changed very, very quickly,"" he told CNN on Sunday morning. ""I think the direction of movement changed quickly. And I think there were a lot of people out there that, you know, ended up getting stuck in positions we didn't want to be in."" Bettes described the experience as the scariest moment of his life. ""I saw people in my life, I saw their faces flash right in front of me. And it just seemed for a moment, everything was in slow motion,  especially when we were floating,"" he said. ""I kind of felt like I was being lifted to heaven or something. I was conscious through the whole thing and remember the whole thing, but it's still a surreal moment."" Bettes and several others emerged with scratches and bruises. One crew member had broken bones, he said, but was in good spirits. The experience left him rattled and unsure whether he'll go out to chase storms again. But Bettes said he had no doubt about the value of storm chasing. ""We show weather, and we like to be out there and show people what these things can do, and help give advance warning. A lot of times the storm spotters out there serve a very valuable purpose. They give ground truth to what meteorologists from the National Weather Service are doing,"" he said. ""But seeing it in person, seeing it for real, and giving that real time information, I think really supplements the warning. It helps people take shelter ahead of time."" ""Storm Chasers"" aired for five years on the Discovery Channel. The last season ended in the fall of 2011. The network expressed condolences in a statement Sunday. ""We are deeply saddened by the loss of Carl Young, Tim Samaras and his son. Our thoughts and prayers go out to their families,"" the statement said. Photos from a professional storm chaser . Tornadoes rip through heartland again: How to help . Powerful storms leave trail of damage, death . The latest round of storms to hit the heartland left a fresh trail of damage and destruction in its wake as tornadoes struck and floodwaters surged. Tornadoes tore through the Oklahoma City and St. Louis areas Friday, ripping up homes and sending thousands scrambling for cover. On Saturday morning, a spokeswoman for the state's chief medical examiner's office said two children and seven adults were killed in the Oklahoma storms. On Sunday, Oklahoma City Fire Chief Keith Bryant said searchers had found the bodies of four additional victims that died in the storm -- two adults and two children who died while seeking shelter in a storm drain. Deputy Fire Chief Marc Woodard said the body of another child had been recovered Sunday afternoon, and the search for six other people unaccounted for will continue Monday. The flash flooding that accompanied Friday night's storm swept the bodies up to four to five miles downstream, Woodard said. The impact of the severe weather extended beyond Oklahoma. In Missouri, a tornado left a path of ""over 10 miles of significant damage ... that caused dozens and dozens of houses to be literally blown up,"" Gov. Jay Nixon told CNN affiliate KSDK on Saturday. No one was killed in that tornado, but three people drowned in the state, Nixon said. In Arkansas, flooding claimed the lives of at least four people -- a sheriff, a wildlife officer and two women they were trying to save from a home deluged by floodwaters, officials said. The house collapsed in the middle of the rescue attempt, Arkansas Game and Fish Commission spokesman Keith Stephens said.","Oklahoma City fire chief says 16 people were killed statewide .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Judy Shepard stood before a massive crowd at the Capitol on Sunday for a single, painful reason. Sunday's National Equality March in Washington coincided with National Coming Out Day. ""I'm here today because I lost my son to hate."" Her gay son, Matthew Shepard, was kidnapped and severely beaten in October 1998. He died five days later in a hospital. More than 10 years later, Judy Shepard addressed the thousands of gay rights activists in Washington who wrapped up Sunday's National Equality March with a rousing rally at the Capitol. iReport.com: See photos from the march . ""No one has the right to tell my son whether or not he can work anywhere. Whether or not he can live wherever he wants to live and whether or not he can be with the one person he loves -- no one has that right,"" Judy Shepard told the crowd. ""We are all Americans. We are all equal Americans, gay, straight or whatever."" The activists marched through Washington, calling for an end to the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy and equality in marriage.  Watch celebrities and others take a stand » . The National Equality March coincided with National Coming Out Day, and came a day after President Obama delivered a supportive speech to the nation's largest gay and lesbian rights group. Obama was praised for his remarks to the Human Rights Campaign, where he said he has urged congress to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and to pass the Domestic Partners Benefit and Obligations Act. But Obama has also been criticized by gay rights activists who say he has put those issues -- and the Pentagon's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, which bans homosexuals from openly serving in the military -- on the back burner. ""Obama, I know you are listening,"" pop star Lady Gaga told the crowd, before shouting, ""Are you listening? We will continue to push you and your administration to bring your words of promise to a reality.""  Watch Lady Gaga speak » . Shepard told the crowd she was confident in Obama's pledge, but that the activists could also play a critical role by contacting their congressional representatives and voting for politicians who support their cause.

It expands the definition of hate crimes to include attacks based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The legislation is awaiting a Senate vote.

Look me in the eye and tell me I am not an American. Well you know what, not one person in any of those places can do that, not one of them."" She continued: ""So what we're here about today is to start telling the truth and to force the lawmakers from coast to coast and in the nation's capital to make our law books tell the truth."" Although Obama's speech Saturday was supportive of changes in the law to reflect equal rights in marriage and service to the military for homosexuals, given a full plate of other issues at home and abroad facing the administration, it remains unclear how quickly the issues at the center of Sunday's march will be addressed.

"It may seem weird that the 2004 low-budget breakout comedy ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is surfacing as an animated series, but for writer/director Jared Hess, it's not that odd that his world of Preston, Idaho lives on. ""We were approached about doing a sequel but at the time it didn't feel right,"" Hess told CNN. ""There's so much low-budget charm in the first film, that it would be hard to recreate that in a live action way in being able to use a real budget."" Real discussions on turning ""Napoleon Dynamite"" into an animated series began more than two years ago, when Hess met with ""Simpsons"" veteran Mike Scully. The pair assembled a pitch and a writing team and are now seeing the fruits of their labor -- a short, six-episode first season, airing during Fox's ""animation domination"" Sunday night block. Whether or not the show will continue past this initial short order remains to be seen, but Hess and his staff are busy writing more episodes in the event that they get picked up. So how does the process of turning ""Napoleon Dynamite"" into an animated series work? CNN recently spoke with Hess from his home in Salt Lake City where he explained just that. CNN: When did the idea to turn this into an animated series start gestating? Jared Hess: There were different stages, obviously, but it kind of happened when we were shooting the movie. But we didn't know anything would happen with the movie at the time. It was just a pipe dream. It really was my wife's idea; we started work on this about two and a half years ago. That's when we met up with Mike Scully. He was already a huge fan of the film and I was a huge fan of his work on ""The Simpsons."" CNN: The normal thing for a live action show is you have to shoot a pilot before it gets picked up. How did it work in this case? Hess: You do a little animation presentation piece to showcase what an episode would look like, design-wise. Initially, back in the day, for ""King of the Hill"" and stuff like that, it was a two-minute stencil animation test to show what it would look like. Over the years, they've ponied up more money because they want to see it fleshed out. We actually did a nine-minute pilot presentation, with a story arc and everything. We did that about a year and a half ago. Based on that and addition to a pilot script and other artwork to make a full packet, they decided to order a season or not. CNN: That's a serious endeavor. Hess: Especially with the animation. One episode, from the time you write it to the color, it takes about nine months. Just doing an animation presentation, that was about seven to eight months. Once you get picked up, you have to start hiring people. CNN: With ""The Simpsons,"" ""King of the Hill"" and ""Family Guy,"" they had to start out getting an audience interested in their world. But we already know the ""Napoleon Dynamite"" world. How does this show materialize? Hess: We have a staff of about 12 writers and we all lock ourselves in a room; there's a couple of dry-erase boards, some sticky notes and we just start pitching potential story lines. We zero in on the ones that we think will be the most funny. ""The Simpsons"" is coming up on its 500th episode and we have a couple of people that are longtime ""Simpsons"" people that are working on our show and they've been valuable. We'll pitch something and they'll be like ""I think we did that Season 10, episode 5."" We actually wrote a lot of the scripts as a group for this first season in getting the right tone and what we wanted to establish for the show.  After we have a script, we get a draft of notes, and then do a table read with the cast as well as people from the network and people that just want to come in and enjoy it. It's a room full of people and we're reading it out loud and in character. After that, we get one more set of notes that we try to turn around pretty quickly and then immediately go and record all the voices. You cut together an audio track -- almost like a radio show -- and we cut it to the length of the episode and that goes to the animators and they start storyboarding to the audio track that we recorded. Then we get an animatic back and we give notes on that and once we've locked the animatic, it ships off to get animated. CNN: One of the things about the film is that it doesn't rely on bad language, raunchiness or sex jokes. But the Fox Sunday night animation block certainly does in its various ways. How does ""Napoleon Dynamite"" continue with its style in this case? Hess: We've been very aware of it and we're working hard to maintain the innocence that people responded to in the film and keep that. Fox already has shows that do that and we can be our own thing without trying to imitate what the other's do. CNN: Who do you see enjoying this show? Who is the demographic? Hess: I haven't been able to isolate that into age group or cultures. I think it boils down to people's specific sense of humor. And the film demonstrated that for us. CNN: What are some of the upcoming plots that you're excited about? Hess: We have one where Napoleon gets a job at a liger breeding facility and that one's a lot of fun. That was the first episode we wrote as a group, about a year ago. One of my favorites is where we have ... in Preston, my hometown, they do this thing every year called the bed races, where it's this annual tradition in the town around Christmastime, where everyone races beds up and down Main Street. We've got an episode about that which is super funny. We also have a Future Farmers of America episode, where we had to get their official approval. We sent them the script and they were like, ""Well, there's some inaccuracies here about the soil-judging competition but we'll let it go."" CNN: Did you ever win a bed race growing up? Hess: No, I actually didn't. I filmed the bed races for my Eagle Scout project. I did a little video for the Chamber of Congress. [Laughs.] . CNN: Are you working on any new scripts or any new movies? Hess: I got a project with Lorne Michaels' company that I'm hoping to do this year. It's a heist comedy based on these people that pulled off the second-largest cash heist in U.S. history back in 1997/1998, in North Carolina. It's a funny, ridiculous story.","Discussions on the ""Napoleon Dynamite"" animated series began two years ago .

"A pharmacy graduate from Massachusetts who sympathized with al-Qaeda, and traveled to Yemen in the hopes of linking up with the terrorist group, was sentenced Thursday to 17½ years in federal prison, court officials said. Tarek Mehanna, 29, was found guilty in December of conspiring to help al Qaeda, conspiring to commit murder in a foreign country and making false statements. ""This is one of the most significant terror-related cases ever brought,"" said Boston College law professor George Brown. ""Prosecutions like this push the envelope in terms of how far the government can go after an individual's conduct prior to committing any terrorist act. ""The government was a big winner today."" Mehanna traveled to Yemen in 2004 to receive training to kill American soldiers and support terrorism at home. But he never found a training camp, and it remains unclear if he ever made contact with a terrorist group. After returning to the United States, Mehanna posted al Qaeda recruitment videos and documents on the Internet, and was convicted of providing material support to terrorists Though it's again not clear if he ever actually made contact with the group. Prosecutors say Mehanna had been in touch with a man named Daniel Joseph Maldonado, who  headed to the Horn of Africa to receive jihadist training. Maldonado pleaded guilty in 2007 to traveling to Somalia to fight in a ""jihad"" against the transitional government there. ""You might call (Mehanna) a terrorist wannabe,"" said Brown, who noted that Thursday's sentencing reflected an apparent compromise. ""I think the judge wanted to be cautious and distinguish this kind of conduct from the more fundamental (and traditional descriptions of) terrorist acts,"" Brown said. Federal prosecutors had asked for 25 years, and Mehanna could have faced life in prison. The case has been a focus of legal experts, who debated the extent of free speech protection and how and when authorities can move against someone believed to be engaged pre-terror-related activity. Mehanna's lawyers had argued that in collecting and distributing jihadist propaganda upon his return to the U.S., he was exercising his First Amendment rights. Some of the material he translated, they say, involved mujahedeen fighting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan more than two decades ago. But prosecutors instead argued that law enforcement has the responsibility to both head off and deter potential terrorist threats. ""There is a greater value in using this case to achieve the ends of general deterrence than in terrorism cases involving isolated or short-lived activities,"" they said in a statement. ""That is because Mehanna's actions are the kind that most individuals who are radicalized in America are likely to contemplate replicating -- traveling overseas to get terrorism experience, and using the Internet to connect with and support other terrorists."" Mehanna's supporters, meanwhile, have pledged their backing online, setting up a website in his defense. U.S. District Judge George A. O'Toole also handed Mehanna seven years of supervised release as a part of the closely watched decision Thursday. Hailing from a Boston suburb, Mehanna earned a doctorate at the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, where his father worked as a professor.","Tarek Mehanna, 29, was found guilty of conspiring to help al Qaeda, other charges .

"The mother of Kenneth Bae, the American imprisoned in North Korea, has arrived in the country to visit her ailing son, according to a friend of the family. Earlier this year, Bae, a Korean-American, was sentenced to 15 years in a North Korean labor camp for what the government called ""hostile acts."" His family has not been able to see him for almost a year since his November 3 arrest in North Korea. ""As a mother, I worry endlessly about his health,"" said his mother, Myunghee Bae in a videotaped statement. ""I want to see him, comfort and hold him in person. I miss him so much."" Bae, of Lynwood, Washington, said that she pleaded with the North Korean authorities to let her visit her son, and expressed gratitude for granting permission. She is expected to be in North Korea for five days with the goal of encouraging her son who has become ill, according to a website dedicated to  Kenneth Bae's freedom. In a prison interview released in July, Kenneth Bae had spoken of health problems including diabetes, high blood pressure, fatty liver and a back problem. He looked noticeably thinner and wore a blue prison garment streaked with sweat and dirt. His family say he has lost more than 50 pounds. ""My heart was broken into pieces when his prison interview was released on July 3,"" said his mother, in her statement. ""His appearance was very shocking, he looked so different, and he lost so much weight. I could not believe that prisoner was my son."" Bae was moved to a hospital for serious health problems, his sister, Terri Chung had told CNN in August. In previous interviews, Chung has said that her brother suffers from health problems including severe back and leg pain, kidney stones, dizziness, blurred vision and loss of vision. He was already dealing with diabetes. His family and friends have asked North Korea for mercy and the United States for help in securing his release. U.S. officials have repeatedly called on North Korea to release Bae. In August, the two countries appeared close, but North Korea rescinded an invitation to a U.S. envoy. Ambassador Robert King, President Barack Obama's special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, had been expected to fly to Pyongyang to try to win his freedom. In previous instances, North Korea has released Americans in its custody after a visit by some U.S. dignitary -- in recent cases, former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. Bae was arrested last year after arriving as a tourist in Rason City, a port in the northeastern corner of North Korea. His sister says that Bae is the owner of a tour company and was in North Korea for work. The North Korean government accuses Bae of setting up bases in China for the purpose of ""toppling"" the North Korean government, encouraging North Korean citizens to bring down the government and conducting a ""malignant smear campaign."" The country's state media also says that Bae had planned what it called a ""Jericho operation"" to bring down North Korea through religious activities. They have suggested that Bae could have been sentenced to death, but avoided it through ""candid confession of his crimes."" On the eve of her trip, his mother looked solemnly into the camera, expressing her anxiety. ""It's hard to describe the agony of the past year since my son has been imprisoned in the DPRK,"" she said in a released statement. ""I spend every day thinking about him and praying for his homecoming.""","Mother of Kenneth Bae arrives in North Korea to visit her son, says family friend .

"Lawyers for presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. say he is not dangerous and should eventually be released from a government mental hospital. But prosecutors are fighting that, saying Hinckley has been deceptive about his activities while on visits to his mother in Williamsburg, Virginia. A hearing began in Washington on Wednesday to determine the future of Hinckley, who shot President Ronald Reagan and three others in March of 1981.  He was found not guilty by reason of insanity in 1982. In opening statements, prosecutor Sarah Chasson said Secret Service agents will testify they performed surveillance on Hinckley without his knowledge earlier this year when he was allowed what he was told was unsupervised free time in Williamsburg. On several occasions in July and September, Hinckley was supposed to go to the movies or shopping but instead went to bookstores where he looked at books about Ronald Reagan and presidential assassins, Chasson said. A requirement of Hinckley's current visitation program is that plans be laid out detailing what he will do when on his own and that medical staff and the Secret Service are informed. According to Chasson, in the first instance in July, Hinckley was supposed to go to the movie ""Captain America.""  Later when he saw his ""treatment team,"" Hinckley not only maintained he had gone to the movie, but he enthusiastically recommended it. Chasson also quoted from a 1987 diary entry by Hinckley in which he said ""Psychiatry is a guessing game"" and  doctors ""will never know the true John Hinckley."" ""The hospital doesn't know what Mr. Hinckley is thinking and he wants it that way,"" the prosecutor said. Hinckley's attorney, Barry Levine, said the issue is not whether Hinckley has sometimes been deceptive but whether he is dangerous. ""This man is not dangerous and the evidence shows he is not dangerous,"" Levine said. He added that Hinckley is ""flawed"" but is ""fundamentally decent."" Levine said that in the two and a half decades that Hinckley has been at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington to undergo treatment and during his visits outside that facility, there has ""not been a single act of violence."" Since 1999, Levine said, Hinckley has been taking a drug called Risperdal. Medical websites describe Risperdal as an antipsychotic medication often used to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Dr. Tyler Jones, director  of psychiatry at St. Elizabeths, testified Hinckley also started taking Zoloft in 2005 after complaining about anxiety. Jones said Hinckley had been diagnosed years ago as suffering from depression and from an unspecified psychotic disorder. But Jones said he's been in remission for both of those disorders for many years. He said Hinckley also suffers from narcissism, which has improved but is still present. Jones said he has interviewed Hinckley but has not treated him. According to Jones, Hinckley's treatment team was informed by the Secret Service that Hinckley had not told the truth about his activities during several visits. Jones said the medical staff discussed this issue with Hinckley, who initially did not appear to view the issue as a big deal, but later understood it was a serious issue. Although concerned Hinckley was not truthful about his activities, Jones said, ""We didn't feel this constituted an increased risk."" The staff decided to reduce Hinckley's Christmas visit to his mother from 10 days to five days, and he will not be allowed to have any unaccompanied activities during that December stay. Jones said the staff had considered stronger action including the possibility of revoking Hinckley's privileges altogether. A September filing by prosecutors said Hinckley ""continues to be deceptive regarding his relationships with and interest in women."" According to the document, in June of 2009 he went on the Internet to find photos of his female dentist. ""When he was caught, Hinckley claimed, falsely, that the dentist had invited him to view her personal photographs."" Asked about the photographs of the dentist, Jones said the photographs were of the woman graduating from dental school and were ""not salacious."" He said the hospital considers Hinckley ""a low risk of violence to himself and others."" Currently, Hinckley is allowed to visit his mother 10 days a month. On July 29, St. Elizabeths Hospital filed a proposal to increase that. The first step would allow Hinckley to have two visits of 17 days. That would be followed by six visits of 24 days. According to the September government filing opposing the plan, the hospital would then ""be given the sole discretion to place Hinckley on convalescent leave in his mother's hometown."" After the judge and all the lawyers were in place, Hinckley, now 56, entered the court wearing a brown sports jacket, dark pants and a striped tie. He shook hands with all his lawyers and sat down. U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman greeted Hinckley and he replied, saying, ""Good morning."" Hinckley's defense team has listed him as a possible witness at the proceedings but has not revealed if he will definitely testify. Prosecutors want to cross-examine Hinckley and his defense lawyers oppose that. Mental health experts and Secret Service agents will testify, along with Hinckley's brother and sister. Hinckley's mother is now 85 years old and is not a scheduled witness. The hearing is scheduled to run about a week and a half.  It's not clear how quickly the judge might issue a ruling on the hospital's plan to gradually allow Hinckley greater freedom. On March 30, 1981, Hinckley waited for President Reagan to leave a Washington Hotel after a speech. He opened fire and hit Reagan, his press secretary, James Brady, Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy and Washington police officer Thomas Delahanty. All survived, but Brady suffered a serious head wound that permanently affected his mobility and his speech. Hinckley, who was 25 at the time of the shooting, was enamored of actress Jodie Foster. He left a letter addressed to her in his Washington hotel room saying, ""Dear Jodie. There is a definite possibility I will be killed in my attempt to get Reagan.""","Defense attorneys want John Hinckley to be transitioned out of a mental hospital .

"Speculation continues to swirl around the potential involvement of violent video games in Adam Lanza's rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December. The official investigation has yet to release its report, but consistent accounts indicate Lanza was an enthusiastic player of violent games. On Monday, CBS News raised eyebrows with a report citing unnamed law enforcement sources conjecturing that Lanza was motivated in part by violent video games as well as Norway shooter Anders Breivik. The investigating Connecticut police later said that's ""all speculation."" According to the Hartford Courant, we know that when the police searched Lanza's home after the shooting, they found thousands of dollars' worth of violent video games. We also know that Lanza's mom let him play games while she traveled. News: Report -- Sandy Hook shooter tried to emulate Norway massacre . But just because violent video games seemed to have been a part of Lanza's life, as with many young men, we cannot jump to conclusions. The reality is that there is no evidence linking violent games to mass shootings. We tend to return to this particular element, and it's interesting to see how quickly people like to latch on to this noncorrelation as if it were truly meaningful.  The notion that mass homicides are linked to violent media was debunked as far back as 2002 by the U.S. Secret Service, which found that school shooters didn't consume high levels of violent media. But as a society we tend to focus on video games because it's easy to do so. For example, in the recent case of Nehemiah Griego, a 15-year-old boy accused of killing his family in New Mexico, the police seemed to have been obsessed with violent games during a press conference. The police representative shifted a reporter's question about illegal drugs to video games, the gist of which seemed to be that the boy enjoyed talking about ""Modern Warfare."" However, other reports suggested the boy's access to violent games or television had been restricted by his family. In the weeks since the Newtown, Connecticut, massacre, there have been a host of high-profile crimes committed by older men. William Spengler, 62, shot and killed two firefighters and apparently killed his sister in New York. Jimmy Lee Dykes, 65, killed a bus driver and kidnapped a 5-year-old boy in Alabama. And Douglas Harmon, 70, killed two people at a Phoenix law office, police said. These older men don't fit the profile of video game players, yet they all did something horrible. Zakaria: Don't blame the video games . Curiously, no one seems interested in investigating the effects of media popular among the elderly. Our attention to video games in the cases of some shootings but not others is what psychologists call confirmation bias, and it creates the illusion of a correlation where there is none. It's worth asking ourselves why we keep returning to video games despite the lack of evidence to support its link to violence. Of course, this kind of association is not new. Some scholars blamed television for the crime wave of the 1970s and '80s, which has since vanished. And comic books in the 1950s were blamed by psychiatrists for not only delinquency but homosexuality (Batman and Robin were secretly gay it seemed. I'm not making this up). In hindsight, these strands of associations look ridiculous, but in the moment they served a purpose. Opinion: NRA's video game smacks of hypocrisy . Rare though they are, mass shootings often strike at schools, malls, churches, theaters -- places we all go in places we all live. One of the questions asked repeatedly after the Newtown shooting is why Lanza did what he did. To say that he was an evil young man who cruelly inflicted suffering on others simply because, in his mind, life had given him the shaft is not satisfying. We want to control the uncontrollable, predict the unpredictable. We want to understand why an impossible to understand event happened and give ourselves some illusion of control. If violent video games were some small but critical component of Lanza's motivation, why we could just get rid of such games and make this whole problem go away. It's a tempting belief but absolutely wrong. Tech: After Newtown, shoppers think twice about violent video games . If we could make it legal to regulate violence in games, would that have stopped Lanza or any of the other mass homicides through history? No, not a one. We should not be distracted from looking for the real contributing factors to societal violence.","Consistent accounts indicate that Adam Lanza played a lot of violent video games .

He says people tend to see an illusion of correlation when there is none .

"As Kenya's leading psychiatrist, Frank Njenga has been championing the cause of better mental health care on the east African country and the continent for more than three decades. He's been working tirelessly to bring quality mental health care in a country where mentally disabled people receive little help from the state and face massive stigma from society. ""It's a horrible indictment on what we've done but the truth and reality is that very little has been done systematically and deliberately by government or by ourselves to bring up the level of mental health in this part of the world,"" says Njenga. In Kenya, an estimated three million, mostly poor, people live with intellectual and mental disabilities, according to NGO and United Nations figures. At the same time, the ratio of psychiatrists to the population is dismal -- just one psychiatrist to half a million people. See also: Kenya's mentally ill locked up and forgotten . But Njenga, who is president of the African Association of Psychiatrists, says the problem is even worse in other countries on the continent. ""It is a major challenge but it is a challenge that is very sadly is spread across the whole of the Africa continent,"" he says Njenga. ""In fact, Kenya is ironically behind South Africa and perhaps Egypt in the ratios of psychiatrists that are available per population. There are countries in Africa where there is no single psychiatrist to five-six million people."" This has motivated Njenga to dedicate his life helping mental health patients and raising awareness in a continent where mental disorders are often neglected and described as ""un-African"" and belonging to ""people in the West."" Njenga, however, discards such claims as ""clear nonsense."" ""For as long as you are a self-confessed human being you will continue to suffer human conditions of which mental disorders are an integral part,"" he says. Read also: Namibia's 'miracle doctor' brings gift of sight . Njenga describes Africa as ""truly the traumatized continent"" that's been plagued by wars, human suffering and lethal dictatorships. ""Whether you are looking at Rwanda or southern Sudan or Sierra Leone or DRC, the number of women and children and adults who have suffered severe trauma is greater than any other continent that I can think of."" He underlines the link between good mental health and productivity and calls policy makers to make mental health services a priority in order to help their countries escape poverty. ""There is no health without mental health and there is no economy,"" says Njenga. ""We are losing far too many men and women to mental illness and therefore to un-productivity by not treating them for mental illness."" Born in Kenya, Njenga was inspired as a teenager by the work of psychiatrist Frantz Fanon, writer of ""Wretched of the Earth,"" a seminal book that explores identity and the post-colonial experience. From then on, Njenga was convinced he wanted to be a psychiatrist. He went on to study psychology throughout medical school in Kenya before moving to the UK for his post-graduate studies at the Maudsley Hospital -- the world's oldest psychiatric hospital. At the end of this studies, however, Njenga chose not to pursue a career in the UK but to return to his home country, committed to promoting the cause of better mental health in the continent. ""I went to the UK to come back and to come back as a psychiatrist and to make a difference in my homeland and in my continent. That is the reason I left Kenya and that is the reason I came back,"" he says. Read also:The Africans giving aid to the world . On his return to Kenya, Njenga embarked on a mission to reduce the social stigma that is attached to going to a psychiatrist or seeing a mental health professional. In a ground-breaking weekly show called ""Frankly Speaking,"" Njenga spoke with his patients on television, putting the spotlight on tough issues such as schizophrenia and substance abuse -- taboo topics that were usually kept out of public sight. ""I felt powerful and relaxed I felt at last here I was able to tell it exactly as it was,"" he says. ""Of all the things I have done in this society  and community it is the program on television -- Frankly Speaking -- because I spoke frankly as my name is and my patients spoke very frankly indeed."" In his commitment to providing top-notch mental health care, Njenga also helped build a private in-patient psychiatric hospital, the first of its kind in Kenya. He's also authored several children's books in a bid to build better understanding of mental illness and advocated for an insurance cover for mental health patients as chairman of the largest insurance company in Kenya. Through awareness and affordable treatment, Njenga has changed how many people in Kenya think about mental health. ""Today the discussion of mental health issues on this continent is focused and is positive -- about that I feel proud and privileged,"" he says.","Top psychiatrist Frank Njenga has changed how many Kenyans think about mental health issues .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan is blocking access to Facebook in response to an online group calling on people to draw the Prophet Mohammed, officials said Wednesday. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority issued the order a day before ""Everybody Draw Mohammed Day,"" scheduled by a Facebook group with the same name. ""Obviously (the blocking of Facebook) is related to the objectionable material that was placed on Facebook. That is why it is blocked,"" said Khoram Ali Mehran of the telecommunication authority. ""We have blocked it for an indefinite amount of time. We are just following the government's instructions and the ruling of the Lahore High Court. If the government decides to unblock it, then that's what we will do,"" he said. The organization has not received any complaints from internet users about the blocking of Facebook, he said. Devout Muslims consider it offensive to depict Mohammed. There were riots around the world in response to a series of cartoons of Mohammed in a Danish newspaper in 2005, and at least two European cartoonists live under police protection after publication of their drawings of the Muslim prophet. Mimi Sulpovar, who started the Facebook group, said she read about the idea on a blog after Comedy Central bleeped out part of an episode of ""South Park"" that mentioned the prophet. ""This is meant to be in protest,"" she said. ""This is something I have felt strongly about for a long time: Bullying by certain Muslim groups will not be tolerated in a free country,"" said Sulpovar, who is American. But Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the idea behind the group was offensive. ""Islam discourages any visual representations of the prophets of God -- Jesus, Moses, Mohammed, anybody -- because we believe it can lead to a form of idol worship,"" he said. ""The majority of Muslims worldwide object to any representation of a prophet of God,"" he said. The idea of ""Draw Mohammad Day"" originated with a cartoonist who has since distanced herself from the idea, Sulpovar and Hooper said. ""The whole campaign has been taken up by Muslim-bashers and Islamophobes,"" Hooper said. But Sulpovar denied being anti-Muslim. ""This extends beyond being able to draw Mohammad,"" she said. ""If it's offensive to you, that's fine, but I don't feel it's right to impose your belief on others through intimidation. ""This is nothing to do with hate or bigotry,"" she said. ""Nobody is inciting violence or preaching open hatred towards individuals."" Sulpovar said she is not a Muslim but added that she had received ""hundreds of e-mails from people trying to explain this to me."" One group member said she saw anger and fear on both sides of the controversy but felt that free speech could not be compromised. ""This is a hot-topic debate, but so is abortion, illegal immigrants, gay marriage and politics. If we allow even a small compromise for one group, then the free speech on topics like abortion, illegal immigrants and politics can also be censored based on accusations that they cause violence or hate,"" Autumn Meadows said on CNN's iReport. ""Hate speech is wanting a group eradicated, physically harmed or dead. I dont think drawing Mohammed falls under that category,"" she said. ""Islam is not above criticism or cartoons. I believe in equality, and censoring Mohammed while we can draw every other . figure in the world does not equal equality,"" she concluded. Sulpovar said Pakistan's decision to block Facebook was ""ridiculous."" Facebook is investigating the block, said Debbie Frost, the company's director of global communications. Sulpovar's group and a similar one had attracted about 7,000 fans between them Wednesday. Groups opposing the idea had about 68,000.

"The federal shutdown is about to hit those who keep an eye on the nation's 100 commercial nuclear power plants. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Monday it expects to furlough some 3,600 employees at the close of business on Thursday if Republicans and Democrats in Congress still have not resolved their impasse over federal spending. The 300 essential personnel who would stay on include about 150 so-called ""resident inspectors."" They serve as the NRC's eyes and ears at nuclear plants. They also include employees who support emergency response, investigators, a skeleton management team, the five NRC commissioners and a few commission staff members, the NRC said. The retained group would also include employees who support emergency response, investigators, a skeleton management team, the five NRC commissioners and a few commission staff members, the NRC said. There are 100 commercial nuclear reactors at 63 sites nationwide. ""We are going to make sure that we continue our oversight of the plants because the resident inspectors will be on duty, and we are prepared to respond to an emergency on short notice,"" NRC spokesman Eliot Brenner said when asked how furloughs might impact safety. In a blog post, Mark Satorius, the agency's executive director for operations, said it has generally operated normally using ""carryover"" funds, but that it cannot continue beyond midweek without new funding from Congress. In the event of a nuclear-related emergency, he said, additional NRC employees can be recalled. ""We sincerely regret these actions are necessary and are eager to resume our important mission as soon as possible,"" he said. Nuclear industry watchdogs said the furloughs were cause for concern. ""Yes, I am worried,"" said Ed Lyman, senior scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""It's not good for anyone and it's certainly not good for the agency that needs to safeguard our nuclear power plants against accidents and terrorism,  and it's certainly not good for the American people. If there's an emergency of course, they'll call back more people. But it's just counterproductive to go through the motions of furloughing a lot of people."" Lyman said furloughs will stall changes the NRC is making in response to the Fukushima disaster in Japan. ""But the most acute issue is assuring that the operating reactors"" are safe. ""I'm not expecting overnight that it's going to be a collapse of safety,"" he said. ""You can only hope for the best that a situation doesn't occur during this time.""","The Nuclear Regulatory Commission expects to furlough about 3,900 people this week .

"Marsha Shapiro and Louise Walpin married each other for the third time early Monday. But this time, it was especially memorable: They were among the first to tie the knot after same-sex marriage became legal in New Jersey. A rabbi first ""married"" the couple in 1992 in a Jewish ceremony. They married a second time in New York in August 2012 after same-sex marriage became legal there. The third time was just after midnight Thursday in the Garden State. The couple helped pave the way there through a 2011 lawsuit that brought about the change. New Jersey now becomes the 14th state to recognize gay marriages. Shapiro and Walpin were married in the home of state Sen. Raymond Lesniak, who championed same-sex marriage in the legislature. Throughout the state other gay couples exchanged vows in early morning ceremonies. At the Newark City Hall, Mayor Cory Booker married seven couples, two of them heterosexual. He had refused to conduct any marriage ceremonies until same-sex marriages were legal in the state. ""It is officially past midnight,"" Booker said. ""Marriage is equal in New Jersey."" Chris Christie drops challenge to same-sex marriages . High court clears the way . On Friday, the New Jersey Supreme Court denied the state's request to temporarily prevent such marriages. Troy Stevenson, executive director of the gay rights group Garden State Equality, said last week that the high court's decision means ""the door is open for love, commitment and equality under the law."" ""This is a huge victory for New Jersey's same-sex couples and their families,"" added Hayley Gorenberg, deputy legal director of gay rights group Lambda Legal and the organization's lead attorney on the case. ""Take out the champagne glasses -- wedding bells will soon be ringing in New Jersey!"" That enthusiasm was not shared by everyone. ""It is extremely disappointing that the New Jersey Supreme Court has allowed the ruling of an activist judge to stand pending its appeal through the court system,"" said Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, last week. ""All in all, today's ruling is another sad chapter in watching our courts usurp the rights of voters to determine issues like this for themselves."" Gov. Chris Christie's administration appealed, and asked the court to delay, a lower court's September 27 order that the state must allow same-sex couples to marry beginning October 21, rather than give them the label ""civil union."" The appeal will be heard in January. But the state Supreme Court on Friday declined to delay the September order in the meantime, writing that ""the state has not shown a reasonable probability that it will succeed on the merits"" of the appeal. ""When a party presents a clear case of ongoing unequal treatment, and asks the court to vindicate constitutionally protected rights, a court may not sidestep its obligation to rule for an indefinite amount of time,"" the 20-page decision read. ""Under those circumstances, courts do not have the option to defer."" Where sex-same marriage is legal . New Jersey has recognized civil unions between same-sex couples since 2007, after the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the state must allow same-sex couples all the rights and benefits of marriage. As far as state rights and benefits went, civil unions and marriages differed only in label. Three states offer civil unions, but not marriage, to same-sex couples. They are Colorado, Hawaii and Illinois. Same-sex marriage is now legal in 14 U.S states -- California, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington -- as well as the District of Columbia. Same-sex marriage is banned in every state not mentioned above, except for New Mexico, which has no laws banning or allowing it.","Newark mayor conducts marriages of several same-sex couples .

"A Spirit Airlines flight departing New Orleans en route to Dallas was forced to make an emergency landing Thursday, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. ""The crew reported smoke in the cockpit and returned to New Orleans, where the flight landed safely,"" said Lynn Lunsford, an FAA spokesman. ""As in all such cases, the FAA is following up with the airline."" The maintenance problem didn't take the aircraft out of service for long. ""Upon indication of a smoky odor in the cabin, our flight 365 from New Orleans to Dallas/Fort Worth returned to New Orleans as a safety precaution,"" said Spirit spokeswoman Misty Pinson. ""It was a normal landing and customers safely deplaned.  After our maintenance checked the aircraft, the flight continued to DFW."" A man who said he was on the flight told CNN affiliate WWL that passengers heard grinding noises and the wheels retracting a couple minutes into the flight. The man, who didn't want to be identified, also said he saw smoke and felt vibrations. Another passenger said the airline told passengers that the problem might be due to the air conditioning system. Spirit Airlines' Pinson said that Flight 365's problems were ""unrelated"" to another aircraft's engine troubles last week. In that case, an engine failed on Atlanta-bound Spirit Flight 165 shortly after takeoff from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. The aircraft returned safely to the Dallas airport. Because of last week's engine failure, this week the airline conducted inspections of all of its engines starting on Wednesday. That led to lengthy delays for hundreds of passengers at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport Wednesday night into Thursday morning, with dozens sleeping at the airport until their aircraft were cleared for takeoff. The safety checks took about 45 minutes per aircraft, Pinson said. Spirit announced Thursday afternoon that all checks had been completed and apologized for the delays. The airline said the checks were voluntary and not mandated by the FAA.","A Dallas-bound Spirit Airlines flight makes an emergency landing safely .

"(CNN) -- James Ford Seale, a reputed former member of the Ku Klux Klan convicted in the 1964 abduction and killings of two African-American teenagers in Mississippi, has died in federal prison, the Federal Bureau of Prisons said. He was 75. Seale died on Tuesday in the Federal Correctional Institution at Terre Haute, Indiana, said bureau spokesman Chris Burke, but he did not provide further details. A jury in 2007 convicted Seale, a former sheriff's deputy, of kidnapping and conspiracy to commit kidnapping in the disappearances of Charles Eddie Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee, both 19. The bodies of both youths were found in a backwater area of the Mississippi River. Seale was serving three life sentences. Seale was not tried for murder, but prosecutors alleged he and fellow Klansmen conspired to abduct, beat and murder Dee and Moore in May 1964. An indictment accused Seale and his cohorts of picking up the two men hitchhiking and driving them into the Homochitto National Forest in southwest Mississippi's Franklin County, where the teenagers were beaten and interrogated at gunpoint. Dee and Moore were then bound with duct tape, and weighted down by an engine block and a railroad rail, authorities said. The FBI alleged the two were still alive when they were thrown into the Old Mississippi River, where they drowned. Their decomposed bodies were found two months later during a search for three other missing civil rights workers -- a case that would later be known as the Mississippi Burning Case. The slayings were officially unsolved until Seale was indicted in 2007, although he had been long suspected in the case. He and another man were arrested in 1964, but released on bond and never tried. The FBI turned the case over to local authorities, and the investigation was dropped after a justice of the peace said witnesses had refused to testify. The case was revived in 2007 after Moore's brother, Thomas Moore, discovered Seale was still alive while visiting Franklin County, where he was helping research the case for a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation documentary. Moore told CNN in January 2007 that he then gave the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi the FBI files on the case, which he had obtained from a reporter. U.S. Attorney Dunn Lampton helped form a task force that led to Seale's indictment. Seale was the first and only person convicted in the Moore and Dee case, the Justice Department has said. Seale's conviction was overturned, then reinstated, by federal appeals courts amid a legal battle over whether the statue of limitations had expired for his crimes. The battle wound up at the U.S. Supreme Court, which in November 2009 let stand a lower court ruling that the statute of limitations had not expired. In his appeal, Seale claimed the statute of limitations expired five years after the crime. The confusion arose out of the fact that kidnapping could be considered a capital offense in 1964 and had no time limit for prosecution. In 1968, the high court eliminated the federal death penalty for that crime, and Congress changed the law to reflect that ruling four years later. But lawmakers in 1994 reinstated kidnapping as being death penalty eligible.

"After months of hints, China announced Friday it will relax its decades-long one-child policy and abolish labor camps in an effort to improve human rights, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Officials had said earlier both controversial policies were under review, but that did not diminish the force of Friday's announcement. The biggest change could be the abolishment of the so-called ""re-education through labor"" system under which tens of thousands are imprisoned in China without trial. Set up in 1957, the system allows the police to detain petty offenders -- such as thieves, prostitutes and drug addicts -- in labor camps for up to four years without a trial. China's judicial process itself is already controlled by the ruling Communists in a one-party regime. In a 2009 report to a United Nations human rights forum, the Chinese government acknowledged 320 such facilities nationwide holding 190,000 people. Other estimates have put the number of inmates much higher. Critics have long accused of the authorities of misusing the camps to silence so-called trouble makers, including political dissidents, rights activists and Falun Gong members. Chinese labor camp inmate tells of true horror of Halloween 'SOS' As part of the reforms, China said it will reduce the number of crimes subject to the death penalty. Even those who know little about China have likely heard about its one-child policy. China's family planning laws require most families living in urban areas to have one child. The policy will be slightly relaxed so that couples will be allowed to have two children if one of the parents was an only child, Xinhua reported. Currently, both parents must be sole children to be eligible for a second child. Glut of women at Shanghai's marriage market . The one-child policy, though applauded by many for slowing down China's population growth, has been widely criticized for resulting in forced abortions and hefty fines that are sometimes used to enforce it. Some critics say the law hurts China's elderly, who typically rely on their children for support in old age, and even constrains economic growth as the working age population begins to decline. ""Since the policy now allows it, I will definitely have a second child,"" one 25-year-old woman in Beijing told CNN. ""It's too lonely for a single child."" Another man, walking through the Beijing metro with his girlfriend, agreed. ""When I get married, I would prefer having two children as I'm the only child in my family.

"By all accounts, suspected Santa Monica shooter John Zawahri was ready to inflict maximum harm. He had multiple firearms and about 1,300 rounds of ammunition. Also, apparently, he had the capacity to kill. Police say he killed his father and brother, along with three others, during a Friday afternoon rampage in Santa Monica, California. But by some strokes of good luck, or because of quick thinking, Zawahri was not able to kill more. ""As soon as I looked him straight in the eye, I saw what he was going to do,"" said Deborah Fine. She told CNN she saw the gunman pull over another woman and hold a rifle to her head. ""I thought to myself, 'What are you doing? Why are you pointing this gun at her?' And so I put on my accelerator, I hit the gas, and I got in between the two of them,"" she said. How to help the family . The bold move quickly turned the gunman's attention to Fine. ""I'll never forget his eyes. They were just so intense and so cold,"" she said. ""I was somebody in the way, and I was somebody to get out of the way. And that's when he raised his rifle."" Bullets struck Fine three to four times across her body. She balks at the idea that anybody might call her a hero. ""It really was just an anger that came over me that he wouldn't leave her alone, and she was young,"" said Fine, a mother of twins. ""I get angry and take on the bully,"" she said. ""I'm glad I did what I did, but thank God, I'm alive."" Source: Santa Monica gunman previously hospitalized for mental health . 'He let me go' Laura Sisk was the woman Fine saw get pulled over. ""He just appeared in the middle of the road,"" Sisk told CNN's AC360 Monday night. He screamed at her to get out of the car and to pick up a heavy bag of his off the ground and put it in her car. ""I suggested he take my car and go. He didn't like that idea and said that I was going to drive him and made me get in. And then he got in after shooting a little bit more,"" Sisk said. During the drive, he gave her directions -- go right, go left, go straight. At an intersection, he opened fire on a bus. Sisk said she was shaking hysterically. The gunman kept telling her to calm down. ""I just kept saying don't hurt me, I have children, don't hurt me,"" she said. ""He let me go ... I don't know why. I don't know if it was because I had said I had children and he bonded with me on that, I don't know."" iReporter: There was a body on the corner . Spree leaves five dead . Police say the spate of violence that left this beachfront city reeling on Friday involved as many as six incidents over 13 minutes. It started at the Zawahri family house on Yorkshire Avenue shortly before noon and ended a mile away in the college library where students were studying for finals. Officers were dispatched to the house to respond to reports of shots fired. There, they found the 1,000-square-foot home in flames. Inside, firefighters would later find two bodies in a back room -- those of Zawahri's father, Samir, and his brother Chris. Both had been shot. Outside the house, police came across Fine. She had interrupted the gunman's carjacking, but his rampage was just beginning. He got into the vehicle and forced Sisk to drive the short distance to Santa Monica College, which Zawahri attended as recently as 2010. Timeline: School violence in the U.S. During their ride, 911 calls poured in, keeping police on the gunman's path. As the car headed toward the campus of the community college, where 30,000 students are registered, he opened fire on a passing bus, slightly wounding three people. He then got out and shot into a red Ford Explorer, carrying 26-year-old Marcela Franco and her father, 68-year-old Carlos Navarro Franco. Carlos Franco worked as a groundskeeper at the college. They were on campus to get textbooks for Marcela. Both died. ""'Broken' is not a strong enough word to describe us,"" said relative Margret Quinonez Perez. 'Miraculous' more people weren't hurt . After shooting into the SUV, the gunman abandoned his hijacked vehicle. In a stroke of good luck for the driver, he left her unhurt. Dressed in black, the gunman then walked the campus, ""shooting as he went along,"" Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks said. Outside the school library, he saw a woman and ""executed her,"" the police chief said. Her death was the fifth of the rampage. Authorities identified her Monday as Margarita Gomez. She was a resident of Santa Monica but not a student at the college. Finally, the gunman walked into the library. ""He attempted to kill several library patrons who were hiding in a safe room. It's miraculous that those individuals were not physically injured,"" said Seabrooks. Mass shootings in the U.S. Inside, Priscilla Morales and her friends hid. ""I was so scared and thought literally I was going to die,"" she said. By then, the gunman had returned to the main area of the library and was met by three police officers. ""Drop it!"" Morales said she heard police say. Then she heard gunshots and a man's screams. Officers had shot and killed 23-year-old Zawahri. The suspected gunman's mother released a short statement Monday night, asking for privacy. ""As may be assumed, I am in mourning for my family and for those who were also affected by this horrific tragedy over the past few days.

"""I am Trayvon Martin"" has become the catchphrase for protesters expressing solidarity with the slain Florida teenager and outrage over his killing. Even President Barack Obama declared, ""If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon."" But who really was Trayvon Martin? There is plenty of speculation, including some bloggers who point to his recent school suspensions -- including for drug residue in his backpack -- and images of him sporting tattoos and a what appeared to be a gold tooth grill as possible evidence of a troubled teen. That portrayal is in stark contrast to the accounts from his family, friends, and teachers who described Martin as an average 17-year-old. ""He was a shy kid,"" said family friend and former football coach Jerome Horton. ""He didn't want to be the center of attention; that's just not him. ""He always walked with his hoodie and his headphones,"" recalled Horton.  ""If he wasn't on the phone, he was listening to music -- anyone that knows him knows that."" Just like most any other teenager, Martin enjoyed listening to music -- R&B was his favorite -- going to the movies and the roller rink with his friends, friends and family said. When Martin entered high school, his childhood goals of a career on the football field were replaced with his dreams of working with airplanes. ""He just loves getting on planes,"" said his father Tracy Martin. During the summer of 2009, his parents -- who separated when Martin was 11, but shared custody -- enrolled their 14-year-old son in ""Experience Aviation,"" a nonprofit program in Opa-Locka, Florida, that introduces young people to aviation. The seven-week program is the brainchild of Barrington Irving, the youngest person ever -- and the first black pilot -- to fly solo around the world, a feat he accomplished in 2007 at the age of 23. Irving remembered Martin as ""a polite kid"" who enjoyed flying. ""When I first met Trayvon he had a strong interest in football. He reminded me of myself because I had a strong interest in football until I fell in love with aviation,"" said Irving. After graduating from the program, Martin spent the following summer as a volunteer, assisting new students enrolled in the aviation program. During high school, Martin also volunteered his time at the concession stand at Forzano Park where he played football since age 5, on a team coached by Horton and his father. ""He would literally go to school and from school he would go to the park to volunteer to maybe about 8, 9 o'clock and go home,"" said Horton. ""That was Trayvon's day, his week."" Martin's mother transferred him from Miami's Carol City High School to Dr. Michael M. Krop High School, closer to her home. ""He was doing average in school, a little bit better when he was at Carol City and then I had him transferred,'' Sybrina Fulton said, according to the Miami Herald. ""I thought Krop was a better school and I wanted a different environment for him. My oldest son has graduated from there.'' In his junior year at Krop, Martin's favorite subject was math, according to his father. ""He was just an average student,"" he said. At Krop, Martin was suspended three times, according to records obtained by the Miami Herald, once for writing graffiti on a door and another time for school truancy. The third suspension took place the week of his death. Martin was suspended for 10 days due to drug residue being found in his backpack. In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Sybrina Fulton responded to her son's suspension: ""Whatever he had dealings with the school, it was not criminal, it was not violent, he's never been arrested."" Darrell Green, a fellow football player and close friend, said Martin was no different from any other teen. ""Everybody gets in trouble,"" said Green, ""Everybody goes through it."" Green remembered Martin as a ""positive person"" and a ""good friend."" During the 10-day suspension, Tracy Martin took his son with him to Sanford, about four hours away from Miami, while he visited his fiancée because neither he nor Fulton wanted their son to stay in his hometown where he could enjoy his friends, said Horton, who has been in close contact with Martin's father. ""He wasn't just suspended from school and up at Sanford kicking it and having a good time,"" said Horton. Martin had only been to Sanford a handful of times. His fateful walk to the convenience store for a bag of Skittles and an iced tea on the evening of February 26 happened only because the teenager pleaded to leave the apartment, said Horton. ""The only reason he got a chance to go to the store is because he begged his dad to go,"" he said. At the time, his father and his fiancée had gone out to dinner and to watch a basketball game, leaving Martin at the townhouse, according to Martin family spokesman Ryan Julison. While walking to the store, Martin was on the phone with his girlfriend, whom he had been talking to for over 6½ hours throughout the day, the family's attorney said, citing phone records. The girl, who did not want to be identified, said she told Martin to run, but he refused, the family attorney said. ""What are you stopping me for?"" Martin asked a man later identified as neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman, according to the girl. ""What are you doing around here?"" Zimmerman asked in response. The girl said she then got the impression that an altercation was taking place and that someone had pushed Martin, because the headset fell out of his ear, and the phone shut off. Moments later, Martin was shot and killed. The details of what happened are still murky. Zimmerman has said through his legal adviser that he acted in self-defense after Martin attacked him. The family disputes that, and witness accounts vary. Fulton told CNN's Piers Morgan that she believes Zimmerman ""hunted my son like an animal."" The teen's killing has captivated the nation's attention, with some saying this shooting of an unarmed teenager has exposed underlying racism.  Some also feel that it's better to wait on the evidence before rushing to judgment on what happened that night.. Others decry the ""stand your ground"" law that allowed Zimmerman to walk away free of any criminal charges. As these broader issues continue to dominate the news headlines, the only thing that is certain is that Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin have lost their son. When asked for one word to describe Trayvon Martin, Sybrina Fulton chose ""lovable,"" adding, ""I miss his smile."" Asked what he would say to Zimmerman if he had a chance to speak to him, Tracy Martin had many questions: . ""I would ask him why did he in fact pick out my son, what was going through his mind that night?"" Martin told Piers Morgan. ""[Did] he realize he's destroyed an innocent child's life? My son had a future. My son was not one of these thugs in the night.

"After 25 years and nearly 30 trials, Italy's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has for the first time been handed a definitive sentence by the country's highest court. Berlusconi, who served three times as premier, was found guilty of tax fraud and given a four-year sentence, of which he will serve only one year due to an amnesty aimed at cutting down on prison overcrowding. READ MORE: Silvio's fury at high court verdict . The high court also ordered a lower court to reconsider whether Berlusconi should be banned from public office. Prosecutors had been seeking a five-year ban, but the lower court will have to review this part of the sentence, and will probably issue a three-year ban. So what happens next? Once the sentence goes into effect in a few days, Berlusconi will have 30 days to decide how he wants to serve the one-year sentence. Jail isn't an option given that the former premier is aged 76, so the choice is between house arrest, and more likely, community service. Then there is the question of whether Berlusconi, a member of Italy's Senate, is eligible for public office, now that he's been convicted of a crime. According to Italy's anti-corruption law, which was passed by Mario Monti's government in late 2012, Berlusconi will be ineligible to hold public office after he serves this sentence, independent of the outcome of the review by the lower court. The Italian Senate will need to decide when Berlusconi's ineligibility begins. Does it apply immediately, which would result in him stepping down as a senator? Or does it apply after the current parliamentary term? Either way, as things stand, Berlusconi cannot run for parliament for six years. Once the public office ban is reviewed and completes its judicial journey, which will take months, it too would need a Senate vote for immediate enforcement, which could ban Berlusconi from holding public office for the duration of the sentence. So what political implications does all this have on Enrico Letta's government and Italy's immediate political future? The Senate vote will be the first critical step and is bound to lead to a ferocious divide in Letta's delicate ""grand coalition"" government, which is comprised of center-left parties and Berlusconi's center-right PdL party. Even if Berlusconi was ineligible for office, there is technically nothing to stop him leading the center-right in an election campaign without running for office. The latest example of this in Italy is Beppe Grillo, the comedian turned politician, who leads his Five Star Movement despite being banned from public office due to a conviction over a road accident. If the center-right won an election, the political office ban could be changed with a simple majority in parliament -- and with ineligibility out of the way, Berlusconi could at least technically become prime minister for a fourth time once the law is abolished. Simply put, Silvio Berlusconi is down but definitely not out. A video statement he released Thursday confirmed this and read like a call to battle and the beginning of yet another very long election campaign. We're in uncharted territory, and what happens next politically is nearly impossible to predict. But the possible outcomes include the downfall of the government. What is certain is that in both the center-left and the center-right there will now be immense internal pressure. With some pushing for an early election as a ""referendum on Berlusconi"" -- 43% of voters in one SWG poll released Friday believe Berlusconi is being persecuted by magistrates -- and others trying to maintain calm in order to keep the government alive in the name of national interest, it will be a question of who blinks first.

"A New York man trying to set a freediving record died Sunday after he surfaced from a depth of more than 200 feet. Nicholas Mevoli, a 32-year-old from Brooklyn, hoped to reach 236 feet (72 meters) with one breath of oxygen and without the assistance of fins. When he surfaced, he flashed the OK sign and then lost consciousness 30 seconds later, organizers said. Mevoli was going for a record at Dean's Blue Hole in the Bahamas. At 663 feet (202 meters),  it is considered the world's deepest blue hole in seawater. The 10-day competition brought together 56 divers from 21 countries who took part in a variety of events. Vertical Blue, which puts on the annual event, said it was trying to figure out what happened. ""Competition freediving has an enviable safety record but the sport can never be risk-free, something understood by all freedivers,"" it said in a statement. In freediving, divers plunge to depths and resurface using a single breath, shunning breathing equipment such as oxygen tanks. Freediving thrills as worries dissolve . For thousands of enthusiasts, freediving offers an experience like nothing else. ""The joy of being in the water, suspended in silence, at that depth, is incredible,"" said William Trubridge, who has won more than a dozen world championships. In a CNN iReport, Trubridge described what it's like.  ""There's a lot of physiological changes that happen,"" he said. ""The main thing which isn't experienced in any other sport is what's called the 'blood shift,' which is where all the blood is squeezed in from your extremities, and at the same time your lungs are becoming crushed by the weight of the water column above you.  So you get blood pooling in the lungs."" ""It's a mental sport as much as it is a physical one. One of the beautiful aspects of it is that it forces you to be in the moment. It's almost impossible to be in the water and at the same time contemplating problems. As soon as you get in the water, that all dissolves and you're just there."" In 2006, he lost consciousness before getting to the surface. He also lost his sense of taste, which has never returned. There are no clear figures on how frequently deaths and injuries occur. ""The statistics are a bit murky,"" Outside magazine reported. ""Some deaths go unreported, and the numbers that are kept include people who freedive as part of other activities, like spearfishing. But one estimate of worldwide freediving-related fatalities revealed a nearly threefold increase, from 21 deaths in 2005 to 60 in 2008."" Photographer Logan Mock-Bunting, who captured stunning images of a 2012 competition, said that despite dangers, serious freedivers are hardly reckless. They're followed by safety divers and can be brought back to the surface, where a medical team is on hand. ""Ultimately, it's the professionalism and constant training of these staff that give the athletes the utmost confidence that they can push their limits and work at top levels,"" Mock-Bunting said. ""The system around them is so strong."" The South Florida Dive Journal breaks down the steps to freediving, from lowering your heart rate to gliding ""with virtually no exertion.""

"Amardeep Kaleka will never forget the moment when his father laid on the ground and prayed. Satwant Singh Kaleka had been shot five times while wresting a gunman in a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. His turban was knocked off, and two kids and a priest crawled up beside him. Together, they prayed. Amardeep Kaleka went to the temple and stared at that spot. His father did not survive. He died along with five others. ""It felt like he was praying and putting something into the zeitgeist and imprinting it,"" he told CNN. His son hoped it would lead to a changing tide on gun violence. Interactive: Faces of the gun debate . As he began his meditation that day, Amardeep made a vow: He would do whatever he could to ensure nobody ever went through what his family had. ""It just came over me that you can't stay silent,"" he said. ""You can't continue to allow violence like this to happen haphazardly at a church, at a school, any place. That was August 2012. Four months later, 20 children and six adults were gunned down in Newtown, Connecticut. That school massacre has led many people, including Kaleka, 33, to question where we go from here as a country. Or if we will ever get there at all. It led him to stand up at a gathering here on Thursday, CNN's ""Guns Under Fire: An AC360º Town Hall Special,"" and ask a panel of advocates with polar opposite views if they could agree on anything. If there was actually any middle ground. ""After meeting with so many senators, so many gun proponents and gun control advocates, it seems like they're recycling the same jargon all the time,"" he said, explaining his reason for the question. ""So I was just hoping, let's get to the common ground."" The panel included National Rifle Association board members, the president of the Brady Campaign to End Gun Violence, law enforcement representatives and other participants voicing viewpoints across the spectrum. Was there a consensus? Sort of. ""There's a lot of common ground,"" Sandra Froman, a member of the NRA board of directors and a former president of the group, said at the town hall. ""We don't want people who are insane to have guns, we don't want terrorists to have guns. Part of this national dialogue is coming together."" So everyone agreed: Something has to happen. The devil is in the details. ""I think the common ground clearly exists from a policy standpoint when talking about background checks,"" said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to End Gun Violence. But it isn't that simple. It never is when it comes to gun control. ""The NRA is not against background checks,"" Froman said. ""We support making sure they are enforced. We're not supporting more background checks of law-abiding citizens."" Her remarks signaled a slight change in the NRA's stance. In a heated back and forth, the two debated whether it was truly harmful to force everyone who wants to purchase a gun -- whether at a gun store, a gun show, or in a private sale -- to go through a background check. Froman talked about how the current background check system was broken, noting that an ""instant check"" in Colorado can actually take about 10 days. ""We have to get it working before we add any more checks,"" she said, noting that requiring everyone to undergo a check would take a lot of resources and money. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey spoke from his experience, saying whatever it took, whatever the price tag, it would be worth it to stem the violence. ""Please, don't worry about the cost. I'll spend the money,"" he said, a line that drew massive applause from the crowd at George Washington University. ""It's a much greater cost than human lives. We have to do something. The status quo is not acceptable."" When Kaleka, the son of one of the Sikh shooting victims, rose to ask his question about finding a middle ground, he wasn't just talking about policy. He also meant in our collective way of thinking. A filmmaker, Kaleka has made a documentary about violence in America. There are too many facets to the problem, he says. ""It's a culture of violence. And that has to do with guns, that has to do with mental illness, it has to do with stigmatizing people, it has to do with the media, everything about our culture."" Many appeared to think he was right. ""Everybody's got to step up on this,"" Ramsey said. ""That's prosecutors, the courts, everyone. If we're serious about this it can't just be a series of laws that are passed."" Much of the discussion inside the town hall went beyond politics and legislation. One heated debate focused on whether armed guards should be posted at schools. That's a proposal that's been discussed by former congressman Asa Hutchinson. ""What is more important than the education and the safety of those children?"" he asked, noting that if malls have armed security, so should schools. ""I believe an armed security presence is very important."" It's an idea that Veronique Pozner thinks about. Her son Noah was killed in the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown. ""I think there might be a certain power in deterrence,"" she said. ""In the case of Newtown, it's clear that the perpetrator did choose the path of least resistance, the most vulnerable defenseless victims. He didn't head for the high school where he could have been tackled."" While she said she wasn't sure an armed guard would have saved her son, she did say it made her feel more comfortable dropping off her other children at the new school for Sandy Hook children, a building that does have armed guards. Colin Goddard, who survived the Virginia Tech shooting, said he understood the desire to protect children, but he didn't understand why arming guards is the go-to solution. ""I just don't understand why the first idea put forth is something that might help at the last second,"" he said, to massive applause from the audience. ""We can do things in advance to keep a dangerous person and a gun from coming together in the first place."" That's the conversation that usually leads to a debate about mental health. It is an area President Barack Obama has pledged resources to; he and many others hope to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. The difficulty comes in figuring out who poses a threat. ""We look at behavior and what's going on in the person's life, the social dynamics and what are the personality issues that make that person think acting out dangerously is a way to handle their problems,"" said Mary Ellen O'Toole, a former FBI special agent and criminal profiler. Froman, the NRA board member, said she'd like to see more sharing of resources to ensure a database of the mentally ill would prevent them from having access to guns. But Liza Long, whose blog post ""I am Adam Lanza's Mom"" went viral after the Newtown shooting, said perhaps we were thinking about this all wrong. What if wasn't just about identifying threats, but actually making a change. ""We spend a lot of time talking about keeping guns out of the wrong hands,""she said. ""What if we could put those resources to making people less dangerous."" For Kaleka, at the end of the day, progress on enforcing background checks would be a step in the right direction. He recognizes that no solution will make everyone happy. But he wishes every advocate, no matter their point of view, would think about the issue as if they were in his shoes.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- Three decades after serial killings of African-Americans in Georgia shook much of the nation, most respondents to a nonscientific CNN poll say Wayne Williams committed what came to be called the Atlanta Child Murders. Although Williams was convicted only of murdering two adults, police blamed him in the murders of two dozen African-American boys and young men that lasted from 1979 to 1981. In Williams' first TV interview in at least a decade, he insisted to CNN's Soledad O'Brien that he's innocent. He's serving two life sentences. A two-hour CNN documentary, ""The Atlanta Child Murders,"" invited viewers to weigh the evidence and hear from witnesses in the case, and then go to CNN.com to cast votes on whether Williams is ""guilty,"" ""innocent"" -- or the case is ""not proven."" Nearly two out of every three persons who voted in the nonscientific poll said they would convict Williams.  According to poll results, 68.6 percent of respondents said Williams was guilty. Only 4.3 percent said he was innocent.  The remaining 27.1 percent chose a third option, ""not proven,"" which was added to the CNN poll to offer a middle ground.  More than 55,000 persons took the opportunity to register their opinions about the case on CNN.com.  By March and April of 1981, bodies were turning up at the rate of one a week, stoking fears among Atlanta residents and many people across the nation. In San Mateo, California, news reports detailing the killings drove 8-year-old Tyika Mitchell, her mother and her grandmother to the TV each night. The memory still gives Mitchell chills, she said. ""I remember being scared to death, especially since he was only killing little black kids, and as such, I believed that it was only a matter of time before the killer got to me,"" said Mitchell this week. The family had roots in Atlanta, heightening their concern. ""It felt like every day a new dead child had been discovered,"" she said. ""I remember my mom and grandmother discussing how they recognized the area of Atlanta the kids were being found in,"" she said.  iReport: Mitchell's memories of scary times . Growing up in Atlanta, Texas, Lisa Dickerson was a 17-year-old high school student at the time. The murders made her more frightened during a class outing. ""It affected everything that we did,"" she said. But looking back on the case, Dickerson feels police may have gotten the wrong man. ""I never thought that [Williams] killed the little boys, and I had a doubt about the two older men,"" she said.  ""I think he made himself look guilty, but I don't think he did it."" iReport: Atlanta, Texas, remembers too . In Atlanta, Georgia, at the time, Jackie Proulx was a 4-year-old white girl, who also recalls being shaken by news of the killings. ""My little friends and I talked about being scared, and would talk about how to defend ourselves against the bad guys,"" Proulx said. ""I also had several nightmares during that time about being chased and terrorized by a monster."" Proulx said she just couldn't believe there were people in the world that would hurt or kill children. ""I had always assumed adults were to be trusted, so it made me feel vulnerable."" iReport: A frightening time in Atlanta, Georgia . Years later, trust for adults, even strangers, became a theme in a college thesis that Mitchell wrote for a criminal justice course. She wrote that children would ""feel comfortable getting into a car with"" Williams because he was a black man from the community. Mitchell, who said she holds degrees in criminal justice and social science, also explored a deeper syndrome in her thesis, self-hate, which she attributes to negative images and stereotypes of blacks advanced by mainstream media. ""Then you have Wayne Williams, who took it to the extreme and engaged in a sort-of genocidal killing spree of only downtrodden African-Americans,"" she said. To this day, the serial killings affect Proulx's parenting of her four sons, ages 4 and 8. ""We have had many discussions about what to do in various situations, like getting lost, or being approached by someone they don't know,"" said Proulx. ""I keep them close to me at all times. I do not let myself just assume they are safe, even in our neighborhood."" Williams was convicted of killing two adults -- Nathaniel Cater, 28, and Jimmy Ray Payne, 21 -- whose bodies were found downstream from a river bridge where police spotted him. Jack Mallard, who prosecuted the case, believes Williams was responsible for many more deaths during the period. ""I would say about 25 of the 28 male victims on the list,"" he said.  Early in the case, Williams failed an FBI polygraph test, which is not admissible in court. DNA science was not widely used at the time of Williams' 1982 trial. But results from the 2007 testing of DNA evidence in the case have implicated Williams in the death of at least one 11-year-old victim, Patrick Baltazar, according to expert DNA scientists. CNN's Jim Polk and Christina Zdanowicz contributed to this report.","Nonscientific poll: 68.6 percent believe Wayne Williams is the Atlanta child murderer .

"Like a signature on a work of art, a set of balloons that read ""BANKSY!"" tied to the side of a warehouse visible from the Long Island Expressway in Queens could be the final piece of the famously anonymous British graffiti artist's monthlong street art residency in New York City. On his website, Banksy called it ""An inflatable throw-up on the Long Island Expressway."" Interactive map: Where to find latest Banksy . ""And that's it,"" it says under photos of the installation posted on the site. ""Thanks for your patience. It's been fun. Save 5pointz.

Banksy also released an ""official Banksy New York residency souvenir T shirt"" design, a JPEG with instructions to take it to a copy store and ""make it yourself."" Painting 'vandalized' by Banksy may bring $1 million for charity . The balloons are already down, according to local reports, and police would not comment on whether they had them or what they would do with them. One of his last pieces, a thrift-store painting he vandalized then re-donated to the thrift store, 23rd St Housing Works in Manhattan, was put up for auction online starting at $74,000, and ended up selling $615,000, according to the store's website. Each day of October, Banksy unveiled new works of art around New York. The works were then announced on his website and posted to Instagram. Many of the surprise exhibits followed his signature street-art style: stencils spray-painted on streets, walls of buildings and under bridges. Banksy's latest starts online bidding war . Others include an animated YouTube video showing what appears to be footage of jihadist militants shooting down an animated Dumbo the Elephant and traveling installations, including a slaughterhouse delivery truck full of stuffed animals touring the city. Also produced were performance art pieces such as a dirt-smeared boy shining the shoes of a life-size statue of Ronald McDonald. The New York Times opted not to publish an op-ed Banksy wrote criticizing the design of One World Trade Center, so he posted it on his website.

"Ontario's top court has legalized brothels, saying Canadian prostitution laws unfairly discriminate against prostitutes and their ability to work in safe environments. A panel of five judges wrote that the law banning common bawdy houses ""is grossly disproportionate"" if all it aims to do is keep public order in a neighborhood and maintain public health standards. ""The record is clear that the safest way to sell sex is for a prostitute to work indoors, in a location under her control,"" the judges wrote in a much anticipated ruling. ""The impact on those put at risk by the legislation is extreme,"" the judges added. However, the court stopped short of allowing prostitutes to openly solicit customers on the streets. The court ruled that prohibiting solicitation remains a ""a reasonable limit on the right to freedom of expression."" ""It is so nice to see that we are now brought out into society. I feel a debutante at a ball. We're almost full citizens, so this is wonderful,"" said Valerie Scott, a former prostitute. Supporters of the ruling said the laws governing prostitution in Canada would now have to change. ""Any form of criminalization pushes the industry underground and gives opportunities to predators. You can see it through the world,"" said Nikki Thomas, executive director of  Sex Professionals of Canada. The judicial panel ruled that the changes should not take affect for at least one year, allowing the government to amend its criminal code. Any of those changes would apply to the entire country, not just the province of Ontario. But the Canadian government released a statement saying it was now weighing its legal options. ""As the Prime Minister (Stephen Harper) has said, prostitution is bad for society and harmful to communities, women and vulnerable persons,"" Rob Nicholson, Canada's justice minister, said in a statement released by his office. The government indicated it would review the decision, but an appeal to Canada's Supreme Court is  also a possibility.","Ontario court rules federal prostitution laws unfairly discriminate against prostitutes .

"Washington (CNN) -- A late evening meeting between President Barack Obama and the leaders of the House and Senate failed to reach agreement Wednesday on a spending plan to avert a government shutdown, but all the participants said progress was made and talks would continue. If there is no deal by midnight Friday, when the current spending authorization measure expires, parts of the government will close down. Obama called the 90-minute talks with House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, ""constructive"" and he said they narrowed and clarified the outstanding issues. ""I remain confident that if we're serious about getting something done, we should be able to complete a deal and get it passed and avert a shutdown,"" Obama said in brief remarks to reporters. ""But it's going to require a sufficient sense of urgency from all parties involved"" to prevent a shutdown that ""could have real effects on everyday Americans."" Both Reid and Boehner told reporters in their own brief comments that the meeting made progress in narrowing their differences, and that their staffs would work through the night to try to reach further consensus. ""I have confidence we can get this done,"" said Reid, who criticized Boehner and Republicans earlier in the day for intransigence. ""We're not there yet."" Boehner, standing next to Reid, said ""we do have some honest differences,"" and he emphasized there was no agreement on either a specific figure for spending cuts for the rest of the current fiscal year or on policy issues that the Republicans want included in the measure, such as specifically prohibiting funding for abortions. ""No one wants the government to shut down,"" Boehner said. Time: Are we headed for a shutdown? Obama called the meeting because of a lack of progress in negotiations during the day, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. A White House source familiar with the situation, speaking on condition of not being identified, told CNN that ""there was almost no progress made today."" ""There wouldn't be a meeting if it wasn't a necessary step at this stage in the process,"" the source said of the evening talks. Boehner announced earlier that the House of Representatives will try to buy more time for negotiators by voting Thursday on a one-week government funding bill that would cut spending by $12 billion and fund the Pentagon for the remainder of the current fiscal year. GOP budget chief calls for $6.2 trillion in spending cuts . ""Republicans have no interest in shutting down the government,"" Boehner insisted. But ""we are going to fight for as many spending cuts as we can get."" GOP leaders said they were prepared to pass the bill on a strict party-line vote if necessary. Democrats, insistent they have already met the Republicans more than halfway in negotiations, oppose such a measure, and it was considered unlikely to clear the Senate. In two speeches on the Senate floor during the day, Reid accused GOP leaders of being unwilling to compromise because of pressure from the conservative Tea Party movement to cut deeper and include provisions on political issues. ""We meet them halfway, they say no. We meet them all the way, they say no,"" Reid said, calling the latest proposed extension from the House a ""diversion"" from making ""tough choices"" to settle the matter. ""The Republican leadership has the Tea Party screaming so loudly in its right ear that it can't hear what the vast majority of the country demands,"" Reid said. Tea Party: Bring on a government shutdown . Obama, on the road in Pennsylvania, declared that he didn't ""want to see Washington politics stand in the way of America's progress."" ""At a time when you are struggling to pay your bills and meet your responsibilities, the least we can do (is) meet our responsibilities to produce a budget,"" he said. ""That's not too much to ask for."" Obama blamed the GOP for using the budget crisis to push provisions relating to hot-button issues such as abortion, health care and the environment. Debates over those issues were holding back talks, he said. Boehner has insisted his caucus will not back down on those issues. He proposed the one-week extension after meeting with his Republican House colleagues. Reporters outside heard applause from within the room at one point. Republican sources told CNN the applause was for Boehner when he choked up while thanking his colleagues for their support on the issue. Government shutdown: White House details consequences . Behind all the rhetorical bluster and bombast, however, negotiations continued unabated. Obama talked to both Boehner and Reid over the phone earlier Wednesday, and Democratic and Republican leadership staffers continued meeting on Capitol Hill in an attempt to break the stalemate. Obama met Tuesday with congressional leaders including Reid and Boehner, and warned then that he would seek further meetings if the negotiations yielded insufficient progress. As for the overall numbers, negotiators were looking at a package of cuts for the rest of the fiscal year that would probably total a bit over $33 billion but less than $40 billion, according to a Democratic congressional source. The fiscal year ends September 30. iReport: Looming government shutdown . The Republican-led House has passed a bill that included $61 billion in cuts from current spending levels, but it was rejected by the Democrat-controlled Senate. Two previous extensions of the government spending resolution have included $10 billion in cuts. In response to the looming budget deadline, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management posted information on its website Tuesday about how a shutdown would affect federal employees. The posting said that most federal workers paid with funds appropriated by Congress would go on temporary furlough in the event of a shutdown. It would be up to Congress to decide if furloughed workers get paid for the time missed when the shutdown ends, the posting said. Health benefits continue if the shutdown lasts for less than a year, it said. If there is a shutdown, an estimated 800,000 government workers will likely be asked to stay home, according to senior administration officials. Among other things, the IRS will stop processing paper tax returns, the Small Business Administration will stop making loans and federal home loan guarantees will be put on hold. U.S. troops would be paid through Friday, but after that, paychecks to members of the military, including those in war zones, would stop. The National Institutes of Health would stop accepting new patients and would put clinical trials on hold. A Justice Department spokesperson said on condition of not being identified that ""critical national security, law enforcement and prison operations"" would continue in the event of a shutdown. Political Ticker: Nation split on shutdown blame game . ""All FBI personnel in the field will continue to work, and the department will be ready to respond to any and all contingencies that might arise during this time,"" the Justice spokesperson said. However, some functions including civil litigation, outreach to crime victims and grant processing would be stopped or curtailed, the spokesperson said. Congressional veterans from both sides of the aisle indicated Wednesday a strong desire to avoid a shutdown. ""My concern with a shutdown is, what is our long-term goal? What are we trying to achieve?"" asked Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee. ""If it is repeal Obamacare (the health care reform law enacted last year), do we think in two weeks or a month Obama's going to go, 'You guys were right,' and sign onto it? I don't think so. So you better look at what your goals are and what you're willing to accept, or don't do it."" Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, said a shutdown would mean ""enormous negative consequences, and I think we're going to rue the day the way we're functioning here. We need to come to the table and ... act like rational human beings."" Republicans, under pressure from the conservative Tea Party movement to make deep cuts that would reduce the size of government, blame Democrats for failing to pass a fiscal year 2011 budget last year when they controlled both congressional chambers. They also say that Obama and his party are ignoring the peril of the rising federal deficits and national debt. Democrats contend that the $61 billion in spending cuts in the House bill would harm the economic recovery and slash education and innovation programs essential for continued growth. Obama and Reid both insist that Democrats have agreed to more than 50% of the spending cuts sought by Republicans, which they said should be sufficient for a compromise on an issue that has little overall effect on the deficit and debt issues. The budget brinkmanship shows the political stakes of the situation, with both parties trying to depict the other as unwilling to do what's right for the country. Boehner has cast aside assertions by Democrats that they had agreed to more than half the cuts sought by the GOP, saying the Democrats used ""smoke and mirrors to get there."" A senior Democratic source with knowledge of the ongoing negotiations said the biggest obstacle to a deal involves whether reductions in mandatory spending programs, known in appropriations parlance as ""changes in mandatory spending"" or CHIMPS, should be part of spending cuts. Examples of mandatory spending programs include Pell Grants, the Children's Health Insurance Program and some types of highway funding. Such programs are funded for multiple years at a time, with the spending set for the time period covered, exempt from congressional authorization each year. Democratic sources have said they want about half the overall cuts in this spending bill to come from mandatory spending programs, and they have proposed the necessary reductions in programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Justice Department and the Treasury Department, and in Pell Grants. Republicans, who want any spending cuts to reflect a reduction in the size of government, note that reducing the spending in a mandatory program for one year doesn't prevent the amount from returning to its original level the following year.

"(CNN) -- Standing in the shadow of the Burj Dubai Kye Ho Kim of Samsung Construction rattles off the list of records the building will break. Standing about a half mile high, it will be the world's tallest building, with the most floors (164) and the world's highest and fastest building. ""This building is going to break so many records,"" said Kim, whose company is building the $4 billion tower, scheduled to open later this year. ""This is kind of a project like the first exploration of the moon. Nobody can challenge it."" It may not rank with manned missions to the moon, but right now there is nothing else like the Burj Dubai on Earth. As the project is metaphoric for the strength of Samsung Construction, the company itself symbolizes the growth of South Korea onto the world stage. A country once devastated by war and still divided by north and south has rebuilt itself into a modern capitalist democracy with companies with a global reach such as Samsung . Samsung has cornered the market in giant building construction, building the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur and Taipei 101 in Taiwan -- both previous world-record holders. ""Think about the Americans when they constructed the Empire State Building in 1931,"" Kim said. ""So have we ... in a very short period of time we are now the leading company in the world."" Some of Korea's more impressive building projects are happening at home. In the midst of the recession, construction of Songdo -- a 1,500-acre new free trade zone built on reclaimed land two hours out of Seoul -- continues apace, with a projected cost of $35 billion. Developers hope it will be the eventual home of 75,000 people. It's considered one of the world's largest private real estate development ventures in history, a joint project with South Korea's Posco and Gale International, a U.S. real estate developer. ""Under construction today is about $10 billion"" of the project, said Chris Sausser, executive vice president of Gale International. ""The project we're building has been able to attract multinational companies, investors as well as residents."" Postwar South Korea was based on a ""growth at any cost"" model, but the South Korean government has pledged 2 percent of its GDP for the next five years dedicated to green development. The country, already the world's most wired, plans to develop next-generation Internet connections that use less computing power. Indoor lighting initiatives are replacing traditional bulbs with lower energy LED lights. ""Green growth is not a plan B, it is plan A,"" said Kim Sang Hyup, executive director of the Green Growth Committee. ""We are going to contribute to the global community by action, not talk.""

"James Tully says he been stopped so many times by law enforcement on his way to work that he's stopped counting. Apparently, he resembles fugitive Eric Frein, who is accused of fatally shooting a Pennsylvania state trooper and injuring another trooper in a September shootout. The search for Frein has jolted the Canadensis area of Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, leading to school closures, roadblocks and multiple police interactions for Tully, who walks 5 miles to work and back each day because he does not own a car.

"Since Islamic State fighters entered Iraq from Syria, they have given the world a revolting look at their ruthlessness. They have left the severed heads of their vanquished on spikes. They have filled mass graves with the summarily executed. They have slaughtered and enslaved ethnic minority Yazidis. When the Islamic State drove tens of thousands of them up mountains, where many died of thirst, it seemed the last straw. U.S. President Barack Obama ordered airstrikes to beat them back. But the same cruelty has fumed next door in Syria -- along with the atrocities committed by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad against rebel fighters. While the world focused on the plight of the Yazidis in Iraq, 500 Syrian civilians died practically unnoticed. So, why is the United States intervening in Iraq, while avoiding Syria? The answers lie in some clear differences in the two conflicts: . 1. International opposition . No nation protects Islamic State. Even al Qaeda is disgusted by its viciousness. But international political entanglement awaits any power pondering action in Syria, due to loyalties to al-Assad. As the United States and its allies have called for action against his regime, China and Russia have put their foot down in the UN Security Council. And Russia has kept al-Assad well-armed. Although Russia rails against Muslim extremists, a U.S. intervention -- even only against Islamic State -- would meet with deep distrust in the Kremlin, especially after the relationship with Washington hit the dustbin over Ukraine. Iran, a close al-Assad ally, would likely also be up in arms. Tehran is allegedly supplying Shia militia Hezbollah, which has crossed from Lebanon to shore up al-Assad's troops. 2. Confusing battlefield . Syria's war is a checkerboard battle -- government troops and Hezbollah in a fight against Islamic State and other resistance groups, who also battle each other. Obama doesn't see a strong partner in the politically fractured Free Syrian Army, because it's hardly a formidable force against al-Assad's professional army. In Iraq, the battle lines are clearer -- the Iraqi government with U.S. support vs. Islamic State. Baghdad has made a shaky showing against the militants. But in the north, Washington has a strong, loyal partner in semi-autonomous Kurdistan. Many of the U.S. advisers deployed to Iraq are stationed in its capital Irbil to support Peshmerga troops in hot confrontation with Islamic state. 3. Ineffective airstrikes . The Syrian government has professional air defenses, including its own air force, which would give the U.S. military serious resistance. Though Islamic State has struck some aircraft, its air defenses are flimsy when compared to al-Assad's. The Iraqi government was bombing Islamic State long before U.S. drones and warplanes joined them, and the Kurdish government has begged for U.S. air support. President Obama has approved targeted strikes in Iraq, but his hawkish critics in Washington have called for much tougher U.S. military action against the Islamist extremists. 4. We broke it. We fix it. It's a moan often heard in the United States these days. Iraq would not be in this predicament, had U.S. forces not invaded and destabilized it. Morally, the country owes them. Add to that the American and civilian lives lost in the war to depose former dictator Saddam Hussein, the hundreds of billions spent, the training and arming of Iraqi forces. The U.S. has no such vested interest in Syria. But, says CNN analyst Fareed Zakaria, that's a stance Washington can't afford to maintain. ""The United States should develop a more cogent and integrated policy approach that deals with Syria and Iraq together -- the challenges in both countries are becoming more interlinked,"" he said. 5. A wariness to step in . To be sure, the President's stance has its critics. Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham want Obama to take the fight against Islamic State into Syria. Respect for its borders take a back seat to stopping the extremists, they say. Former U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford resigned in protest of America's inaction against al-Assad. He has found fault with Washington for allowing Islamic State to burgeon in Syria. And former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recently said that the President does not apply U.S. might aggressively enough. But, after pulling the country out of two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the President has said that the United States should be leery of trying to solve the world's crisis. As he has reportedly said, ""Don't do stupid stuff."" How religion could complicate U.S. intervention in Iraq .

"After years of controversy, the latest version of the ""psychiatric bible"" -- the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -- has been released. The DSM-5 (fifth edition)'s introduction, over the weekend at the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting, marks ""the end of more than a decade's journey in revising the criteria for the diagnosis and classification of mental disorders,"" the association says on the DSM-5 website. The manual includes the criteria used by mental health professionals to diagnose patients. It's also used by insurance companies, schools and other agencies responsible for covering and creating special provisions for individuals with developmental or mental disorders. The overhaul -- the first for the DSM since 1994 -- has not come without opposition from activists, some grass-roots organizations and even the National Institute of Mental Health, which last month said it was launching a project aimed at laying the foundation for a new classification system and would be ""re-orienting its research away from DSM categories."" Are we over-diagnosing mental illness? Here are five ways the DSM changes may affect you: . Bereavement or depression? Previously, clinicians were advised against diagnosing major depression in people within two months after the death of a loved one: the ""bereavement exclusion."" The DSM-5 removes the exclusion, a move the psychiatric association says ""helps prevent major depression from being overlooked and facilitates the possibility of appropriate treatment including therapy or other interventions."" Research has shown that for some people, the death of a loved one can precipitate major depression -- much like other stressors such as losing a job, the association says on the DSM-5 website. But ""bereavement is the only life event and stressor specifically excluded from a diagnoses of major depression"" in previous manuals. Binge eating is officially an eating disorder . Binge eating was approved as its own category of eating disorder in the DSM-5. It's defined as ""recurring episodes of eating significantly more food in a short period of time than most people would eat under similar circumstances, with episodes marked by feelings of lack of control."" According to the association, the move is aimed at ""increasing awareness of the substantial differences between binge eating disorder and the common phenomenon of overeating. While overeating is a challenge for many Americans, recurrent binge eating is much less common, far more severe, and is associated with significant physical and psychological problems."" Binge drinkers may be diagnosed as mild alcoholics . The revised DSM collapses the medical distinction between problem drinking and alcoholism. Some experts say this could lead college binge drinkers, for example, to be mislabeled as alcoholics, a diagnosis that may follow them into adulthood. Prior DSM editions included ""alcohol abuse,"" along with the more serious ""dependence."" However, the DSM-5 will make ""alcohol use disorder"" a single condition. ""The field of substance abuse and addiction has witnessed an explosion in important research in the past two decades,"" said Dr. David Kupfer, chairman of the DSM-5 Task Force, in a February statement. The changes ""reflect the best science in the field and provide new clarity in how to diagnose these disorders."" Asperger's syndrome becomes autism spectrum disorder . The proposal to group Asperger's and other developmental conditions together generated a flurry of comments and concerns. In 2010, when the change was proposed, the Asperger's Association of New England, a nonprofit organization with more than 3,000 members, wrote a letter to the American Psychiatric Association emphasizing that Asperger's should remain separate. But ""the revised diagnosis represents a new, more accurate, and medically and scientifically useful way of diagnosing individuals with autism-related disorders,"" the national group says on the DSM-5 website. The work group that recommended the change ""believes a single umbrella disorder will improve the diagnoses of ASD without limiting the sensitivity of the criteria, or substantially changing the number of children being diagnosed."" In a statement on its website Tuesday, the New England association assures its members, ""regardless of your diagnosis or label, we will continue to provide a gathering place where members of the Asperger's community can connect to one another."" Doctor: Why we're making changes to autism diagnosis . Being transgender no longer a mental disorder . The DSM-5 eliminates the term ""gender identity disorder,"" which mental health specialists, along with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender activists, had considered stigmatizing. It refers to ""gender dysphoria,"" which focuses attention only on those who feel distressed by their gender identity. ""I think it's a significant change,"" Jack Drescher, a member of the psychiatric association group that recommended the change, said late last year. ""It's clinically defensible, but it reduces the amount of stigma and harm that existed before."" Homosexuality was removed from the DSM in 1973, a move he believes changed global views. Some LGBT activists applauded the change, while others have questioned whether it goes far enough.","The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual was released over the weekend .

"Two of Saudi Arabia's best-known female advocates for lifting the ban on women driving were detained on Friday after being caught behind the wheel in the country's capital. Aziza Al-Yousef, who was driving the car, and her passenger, Eman Al-Nafjan, tell CNN they were pulled over and spent a few hours at a police station in Riyadh until being released into the custody of their respective husbands. Al-Nafjan, one of Saudi Arabia's most prominent bloggers, and one of the organizers of the popular October 26 Women's Driving Campaign, said she decided to go for a spin with Al-Yousef to attract more attention to her cause. ""We were looking for the police. We drove by the police station on purpose,"" she explained, adding how she welcomed the detention. Despite repeated attempts, CNN has been unable to reach Riyadh police for comment. Al-Yousef and Al-Nafjan, who tweets as ""Saudiwoman,"" say they have grown tired of waiting for the Saudi government to allow women to drive. ""We are sick and tired of waiting to be given our rights,"" Al-Yousef told CNN. ""It's about time to take our rights."" Al-Yousef has driven before and was glad to get behind the wheel again on Friday but says she was not deliberately looking to be detained by the police. ""In a way it is good for the cause because you'll the keep the issue in the mind of people,"" said Al-Yousef. ""However, some people might understand wrongly that we're confronting the government and that might slow the process."" Why Saudi Arabia can't ban women from driving forever . Al-Yousef was initially concerned she and Al-Nafjan might go to jail, citing the presence of traffic police, regular police and secret police who were called to the scene. She says the mood of the police had lightened substantially by the time she and Al-Nafjan reached the station. When her husband came for her, he was asked to sign a statement pledging Al-Yousef would not drive again. Al-Yousef says her husband jokingly asked, ""How can I do that? I can't prevent her from driving. Only God can do that,"" before signing. She was then released. The issue of women driving is a particularly sensitive and controversial one in Saudi Arabia, the last country on Earth where females don't have that right. In recent years, though, more women have challenged the government, urging officials to overturn the ban and taking to streets in remarkable displays of civil disobedience. Although women are not allowed to drive in the ultraconservative Kingdom, there is, in fact, no law barring them from doing so. But religious edicts are often interpreted to enforce the prohibition. ""We have tried all the legal channels,"" explained Al-Nafjan. ""The government keeps promising us that all we have to do is be patient and quiet, and we'll eventually get the right to drive. Officials keep saying the women driving issue is one for Saudi society to decide. We wanted to prove that really isn't the case and that the only people who really stop us is the police."" In May 2011, Manal Al-Sharif was jailed for more than a week after posting a video of herself driving in Saudi Arabia online. She quickly became a hero to many and inspired dozens of women to drive throughout the streets of various cities in June of that year. More recently, in September, a website for the October 26 Women's Driving Campaign launched, and within a few weeks, tens of thousands had signed an online petition calling for an end to the driving ban for women in Saudi Arabia. As October 26 approached, numerous women filmed themselves driving in the conservative Kingdom and uploaded those clips to sites like YouTube. Opinion: Give Saudi women the right to drive . In the weeks leading up to October 26, one Saudi cleric gave an interview in which he warned that Saudi women who drove risked damaging their ovaries. On October 24, the country's Interior Ministry issued a statement telling women to stay off the streets. Despite strong opposition by conservative quarters in the Kingdom, where a puritanical strain of Islam is practiced, October 26 saw dozens of women taking to the streets and driving. The campaign's backers insist the movement is ongoing and has been a success thus far, while its critics say it has failed. Last week, Al-Yousef had an audience with Saudi Arabia's Interior Minister, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, via teleconference. She conveyed a message on behalf of the growing number of women and men calling for an end to the driving ban. Al-Yousef was told the matter was now in the hands of Saudi King Abdullah, considered a cautious reformer. ""I think it might have been a good thing,"" said Al-Yousef. ""Before the government had said the driving issue was a societal issue. But now that is not an issue anymore. The good thing is now we know clearly that society is not the decision maker."" Al-Yousef added: ""We are trying to find a way to reach the King now. We have a letter signed by 3,000-plus people asking for permission to allow women to drive, and we want to find a way to get that letter to the King."" Al-Nafjan, who was detained before for the very same offense, says she will continue pushing the envelope, even if that gets her into legal hot water. ""I wouldn't mind if they prosecuted me,"" she says. ""I think it will further the cause. It's good publicity for the cause -- to be prosecuted for being a passenger in a car driven by a woman. You can't get more medieval.""","Prominent advocates for allowing women to drive detained in Riyadh police station .

"Star NFL linebacker Junior Seau -- just 43 years old when he took his own life last May -- suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative brain disease that can follow multiple hits to the head, the National Institutes of Health said Thursday. Questions of CTE came up immediately after Seau's body was found, with a handgun nearby, in the bedroom of his home in Oceanside, California. CTE can result in Alzheimer's-like symptoms such as dementia, memory loss, aggression and depression, but it can be diagnosed only after death. In a statement issued Thursday, Seau's family said, ""While the NIH's findings have provided a measure of comfort, we remain heartbroken that Junior is no longer with us, and are deeply saddened to receive confirmation that he suffered from such a debilitating condition. ""Junior was a loving father, teammate and committed member of his community,"" the statement continued. ""That is how we will always remember him."" Seau's death adds to dark legacy of championship team . Seau's family donated his brain to the National Institutes of Health for research, and Thursday the NIH released a statement saying ""abnormalities were found that are consistent with a form of (CTE)."" According to the pathology report from the NIH, five researchers -- two NIH neuropathologists and three independent experts -- examined slides of Seau's brain and all confirmed that there were signs consistent with CTE. None of the researchers was aware of the identity of the brain when initially looking at it. In a recent study, researchers found CTE in 34 of 35 deceased NFL players whose brains were donated by family members. Dr. Ann McKee, the director of neuropathology at VA Boston and a co-author of that study, says the CTE diagnosis in the Seau case was not unexpected. ""From what I've read about the symptoms (Seau) was experiencing the last couple of years -- the ones relayed by the family -- it is not surprising to me that he had this disease,"" said McKee, who was not involved in the Seau case. ""It doesn't sound like it was early CTE, that it was becoming quite widespread in the brain. And he was young at the time of death. It is another sad day to see another fairly well-established case of CTE."" A brain with CTE is riddled with dense clumps of a protein called tau. Under a microscope, tau appears as brown tangles similar to dementia. However, the Boston study showed this progressive, tau protein array in football players much too young for a dementia diagnosis, which typically occurs in people in their 70s or 80s. Opinion: Seau was hurting, and didn't know how to say it . What may be a surprise to some is that Seau was never diagnosed with a concussion in all the years he played football. That points to the bigger mysteries of the disease that scientists such as Dr. Julian Bailes, the co-director of the NorthShore Neurological Institute, hope to someday solve. ""It is not unprecedented that he didn't have a concussion history. That's part of the problem in figuring this out,"" Bailes said. ""It seemed logical at first that it would be people with multiple concussions that would be at risk of CTE. As we've learned more, it was surprising that some of those at risk for CTE were players who did not have a history of concussion."" Seau was one of a string of high-profile NFL players -- along with Dave Duerson, Shane Dronett and Shane Easterling -- who took their own lives and were later diagnosed with CTE. Not everyone who is exposed to repeated head trauma would develop the disease, experts say. ""Based on what we know thus far, I think we have to assume that the No.1 risk factor we have is the degree or extent of exposure,"" Bailes said. ""And if anyone had high exposure, if there was anyone you'd worry about, it'd be Junior Seau. He played for 30 years. He played youth football, college football, for 20 years in the NFL."" The National Football League responded to the announcement of Seau's diagnosis with a statement saying, ""We appreciate the Seau family's cooperation with the National Institutes of Health. The finding underscores the recognized need for additional research to accelerate a fuller understanding of CTE."" The NFL Player's Association issued a statement calling on Congress to review the issues of health and safety in football, mentioning the $100 million it set aside of player funds for medical research during the term of the current collective bargaining agreement. The NFLPA also said it has asked the league for independent sideline concussion experts, the certification and credentialing of professional football medical staff and better worker's compensation. ""The only way we can improve the safety of players, restore the confidence of our fans and secure the future of our game is to insist on the same quality of medical care, informed consent and ethical standards that we expect for ourselves and for our family members,"" the statement said.","Seau's family is ""deeply saddened to receive confirmation"" of his condition .

"Ronney Jenkins cannot be sure whether chronic traumatic encephalopathy is clawing through his brain tissue right now, but he suspects that it is. After all, he fits an emerging portrait of people diagnosed with the disease: a former professional football player who took lots of hits to the head -- a couple knocked him out -- and a life off the field that has begun to unravel. ""My mood has changed,"" said Jenkins, 36, a soft-spoken former running back who played for several teams, including the San Diego Chargers. ""Sometimes I think I'm going crazy."" Jenkins began to suspect CTE several years ago when an uncharacteristic dark mood and, occasionally, deep anger began to bubble up at unexpected times. ""I'd be talking to a cousin of mine, disagree with him, and I'd just want to do something to him,"" Jenkins said. ""I don't know why I had those thoughts, but I wanted to hurt him."" Jenkins cannot shake the feeling that these and other symptoms he has add up to CTE, but he will never be sure. The only way to diagnose CTE is after death -- by analyzing brain tissue and finding microscopic clumps of an abnormal protein called tau. ""The problem is, people are diagnosing CTE clinically all over the place,"" said Robert Stern, professor of neurology and neurosurgery at Boston University School of Medicine. ""There is no framework to make that diagnosis while someone is alive."" Stern and his colleagues want to change that. He is co-author of a new study that is beginning to describe what the disease looks like during life. The study, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, suggests that when CTE symptoms emerge at a young age, players more often exhibit behavioral and mood problems, whereas symptoms that begin later in life tend to show up as memory and thinking problems. Family members and loved ones of 36 athletes -- 29 football players, three professional hockey players, one professional wrestler and three boxers diagnosed with CTE after they died -- were quizzed about, among other things, the nature of the players' CTE symptoms and when they appeared. A tale of two former NFL players -- and their brains . According to those family reports, 11 players in the group first struggled with memory and decision-making, at an average age of 69. Twenty-two players first exhibited mood and behavior problems like depression and hopelessness or violent, explosive behavior. Those players tended to be younger when they died, an average age of 51. Three players did not display any symptoms before being diagnosed with CTE. It is too early in the research to know why some symptoms crop up early and others later -- and why the symptoms seem to diverge, or not show up at all, depending on the player. One theory among scientists is that where and how the damage manifests in the brain matters. For example, tau, which tends to be peppered in particular areas of the brains of people diagnosed with CTE, could damage brain tissue at different stages of the disease, depending on the person. ""There is no specific order of changes in CTE; it's on a case-by-case basis,"" said Stern, who is also the co-founder of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy. ""It could be that some people have more initial changes to (brain) areas that are more responsible for mood and aggression and impulse control."" Symptoms could also be explained by other changes in the brain, associated with repetitive brain trauma, that have nothing to do with tau or CTE. Junior Seau had brain disease that comes from hits to head . ""This disease remains somewhat mysterious in terms of exactly what its causes are and how it's expressed,"" said Dr. Julian Bailes, co-director of the NorthShore Neurological Institute and a CTE researcher, who was not involved in the current study. But Bailes says this study, though small and not generalizable for all cases of CTE, adds to current knowledge about the disease. For example, the data did reveal other interesting patterns, particularly related to genetics. The study participants with CTE were more likely than people without the disease to express the APOE gene, which is associated with slower recovery and worse cognition after traumatic brain injury; it's also associated with later development of Alzheimer's disease. Stern and his colleagues know that their study sample is skewed: People who tend to donate a loved one's brain to be studied for CTE also tend to suspect a problem. And there is no formula for how many hits (or what type of hits) tip the balance toward symptomatic disease. There has also been no examination of what role things like steroids or body weight may play. Even with those caveats, Stern is confident that ""eventually, clinicians will have the ability to diagnose the disease during life."" In the meantime, former players like Jenkins are left in a fight against time and the progression of whatever brain disease their concussions may have wrought. ""I'm paying attention to things more,"" he said, ""and I'm more worried about my health."" In the meantime, researchers of many disciplines are scrambling to define a disease that's definition is elusive at best. ""For perspective, Alzheimer's disease was first described in the first decades of the 1900s, and we still don't have the ability to diagnose it definitively during life,"" Stern said. ""It still can't be cured, prevented or even slowed down."" Both Jenkins and Stern hope that for CTE, it will not be that long.

"A teen who performed at events around President Barack Obama's inauguration was shot to death in Chicago this week, and now her story has become part of the debate in Washington over gun violence nationwide. The shooting death of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton came up in a U.S. Senate hearing and a White House press briefing Wednesday. ""She was an honor student and a majorette,"" said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois. Performing at inaugural events last week ""was the highlight of her young, 15-year-old life,"" he said. Speaking at Wednesday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun violence, Durbin mentioned Pendleton's death as he argued that more must be done to stop gun crimes. Giffords: 'Too many children dying' ""Yesterday, in a rainstorm after school, she raced to a shelter. A gunman came in and shot her dead,"" he said. ""Just a matter of days after the happiest day of her life, she's gone."" The park shelter where she was shot is just a mile from Obama's home in Chicago. White House spokesman Jay Carney described her death as a ""terrible tragedy."" ""The president has more than once, when he talks about gun violence in America, referred not just to the horror of Newtown or Aurora or Virginia Tech or Oak Creek but to shootings on the corner in Chicago or other parts of the country,"" Carney told reporters. ""And this is just another example of the problem we need to deal with.""

Carney said the president and first lady's thoughts and prayers are with Pendleton's family.

"Jesse Jackson Jr. grew up in his father's shadow, placing him on history's stage as the Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. led civil rights campaigns, including Operation PUSH and the Rainbow Coalition. Jackson was born in 1965, just months before President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, which forced election changes that opened up the political process for African-Americans in the United States. He spent his 21st birthday in a District of Columbia jail cell after being arrested in an anti-apartheid protest at the South African Embassy in 1986, according to the biography on his congressional website. He was on the stage in Cape Town in 1990 when Nelson Mandela delivered his historic speech after his release from 27 years in a South African prison, the biography says. The younger Jackson earned a Master of Arts degree in theology and then a law degree in 1993. He served as national field director for his father's Rainbow Coalition, a role that included leading the campaign to register millions of new voters, the biography says. In 1995, the 30-year-old Jackson became the 91st African-American elected to Congress. Since then, he has represented Illinois' 2nd Congressional District, which includes parts of Chicago's South Side and Cook County suburbs. A potential opportunity created by Barack Obama's election as president in 2008 ironically triggered a series of events that nearly four years later threatens Jackson's political career. Jackson, then 43, spoke with then-Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich in fall 2008 about the possibility of being appointed to serve the remaining two years of Obama's vacated U.S. Senate term. Blagojevich was arrested by federal agents the next day, and was accused of trying to sell the seat to the highest bidder. Jackson said he only presented his credentials and polling information that suggested he could win re-election in 2010. Blagojevich, eventually convicted on multiple corruption charges, started serving a 14-year prison sentence in March. The House Ethics Committee has been examining allegations Jackson or one of his associates offered to raise funds for Blagojevich in exchange for the Senate seat. ""In doing so, Rep. Jackson may have violated federal law and House rules concerning the proper use of the member's representational allowance,"" the statement said. Jackson has maintained his innocence and pledged to continue to cooperate with authorities.""I did nothing illegal, unethical or inappropriate in that pursuit, and I believe that is what the Ethics Committee will conclude at the end of this process,"" he said. Jackson apologized to his constituents in September 2010, after the Chicago Sun-Times reported that a Chicago businessman told federal investigators that Jackson had asked him to pay for a restaurant hostess to fly between Washington and Chicago several times. He said he was ""deeply sorry"" that he had ""disappointed some supporters."" The newspaper also reported that the businessman, Raghuveer Nayak, told the FBI that Jackson asked him to raise $6 million for Blagojevich in exchange for Obama's vacated Senate seat. The governor ended up appointing former Illinois Attorney General Roland Burris to the Senate post. Despite the congressional investigation, Jackson decisively won a heated primary for a 10th term. The congressman disappeared from Capitol Hill in May, and in June explained in a statement released by his staff that he was taking a leave of absence because he was suffering from a ""medical condition."" On Wednesday, Jackson's office released a statement that said he is ""receiving intensive medical treatment at a residential treatment facility for a mood disorder."" The statement attributed the quote to an unidentified doctor. The doctor also was quoted as saying Jackson ""is responding positively to treatment and is expected to make a full recovery.""

"A former U.S. soldier convicted five years ago of murdering an Iraqi family died Saturday, two days after an apparent suicide attempt in his Arizona prison cell, authorities said. Steven Green was found unresponsive last Thursday, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The deputy chief medical examiner with Pima County, Dr. Eric Peters, said the cause of death was suicide by hanging. In 2009, Green was found guilty in U.S. District Court in Kentucky of raping a 14-year-old Iraqi girl and murdering her, her parents and her 6-year-old sister in the town of Yusufiya, about 20 miles south of Baghdad. The crimes occurred three years before the conviction. Prosecutors sought the death penalty but a jury couldn't reach a unanimous decision. He issued a public apology for his crimes, one the relatives of the victims didn't accept. Green, who was sentenced to multiple life sentences without possibility of parole, told the family he was ""truly sorry for what I did in Iraq."" ""I helped to destroy a family and end the lives of four of my fellow human beings, and I wish that I could take it back, but I cannot,"" Green said, reading a statement at a victim impact hearing. ""And, as inadequate as this apology is, it is all I can give you."" The relatives decried Green's sentence and testified about how the heinous crime had shattered their lives, and how it will haunt them always. Green said that he knew ""you wish I was dead, and I do not hold that against you. If I was in your place, I am convinced beyond any doubt that I would feel the same way."" Green was tried in a civilian court in Paducah, Kentucky, because he had already been discharged from the Army by the time his crimes surfaced. He was the last of five soldiers who served in the 101st Airborne Division, based at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, to be convicted for the crimes and their subsequent cover-up.

"The Senate blocked a measure Tuesday that would have authorized construction of the Keystone XL pipeline as Democrats chose their pro-environment base over an old friend -- embattled Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu. The vote could just be a speedbump for the Keystone project, with Republicans ready to try again -- with much better odds of success -- once they take control of the Senate in January. ""This will be an early item on the agenda in the next Congress,"" incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said after Tuesday night's vote. But it's a sharp blow to Landrieu, who had based much of her campaign for re-election in a December runoff on the argument that she could deliver results. For days she had insisted that she had the 60 supporters necessary to cross a key procedural threshold, only to fall one vote shy on Tuesday night. ""This is for Americans, for American jobs, to build an American middle class, and it will create 40,000 immediate jobs,"" Landrieu said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote. ""If the people of this Congress haven't noticed, there's a long unemployment line in some parts of this country."" The vote served as a preview of the confrontations that lie ahead in Washington. President Barack Obama is on track to overhaul immigration rules on his own by the end of the year -- a move that is pushing some conservatives to consider shutting down the government in retaliation. And as soon as the new Republican Congress is sworn in next year, Keystone will be back on the agenda, along with efforts to curtail Obamacare, raising the prospect of Obama issuing a series of vetoes. But for all the battles that lie ahead, Tuesday's vote was really about local politics. Louisiana's Senate race is headed for a Dec. 6 runoff election, and Landrieu -- currently the Senate Energy and Natural Resources chairwoman -- saw the pipeline as a final chance to demonstrate her clout to voters in an energy-rich state. Republicans responded by guaranteeing her opponent, Rep. Bill Cassidy, a seat on the energy committee. The House GOP also had him sponsor their own Keystone authorization bill, which was approved Friday on a 252-161 vote. Cassidy rubbed salt in Landrieu's wound Tuesday, with his spokesman saying the vote was ""perfect snapshot of her time as chair of the Energy Committee -- a failure."" Right now, the decision on whether to approve the Canada-to-Texas pipeline is in the hands of the State Department. Obama has said repeatedly in recent days that he wants Congress to stay out of it and leave it to State to finish its review of -- among other factors -- whether the pipeline would contribute to carbon pollution the could cause climate change. ""There is a process underway and the president is confident that that process will carefully evaluate the consequences of this specific proposal and that that's the proper way for a decision like this to be made,"" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday. Six years into that review, though, lawmakers have grown impatient. ""This process has not worked. This process has not brought this project some sort of finality -- yes or no?"" North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, one of the pipeline's most outspoken Democratic supporters, said on the Senate floor Tuesday. Liberal Senate Democrats like California's Barbara Boxer railed against the pipeline Tuesday, arguing that the environmental harm it could cause far outweighs the potential economic gains. Boxer pointed to potential health risks of laying the pipeline, including heart disease, increased hospitalization, and a higher prevalence of chemicals that ""penetrate deeply into the lungs."" ""The facts are the facts are the facts,"" she said. ""If you're not a scientist then be humble and listen to the peer-reviewed scientists. They don't have a special interest. They have an interest in giving us information we should base our decisions upon. "" Boxer also referred to the project as the ""Keystone Extra Lethal Pipeline."" The Keystone debate on Tuesday pitted traditional Democratic allies against each other. Many of the Democratic no votes were longtime friends and supporters of Landrieu who had contributed tens of thousands to her campaign. Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California, Chris Coons of Delaware and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota all contributed $7,000 or more to her campaign, and all opposed passage of the bill. In the lead-up to Tuesday night's vote, the big question was whether Landrieu could find the 60 supporters necessary to clear a key procedural threshold. In addition to the chamber's 45 Republicans, all of whom were expected to support the bill, Landrieu was joined by 10 more Democratic co-sponsors: Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor, Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly, Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, Montana Sen. Jon Tester, Montana Sen. John Walsh, North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan, North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. Three more Democrats had pledged last week to support the measure: Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Delaware Sen. Tom Carper and Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey. That left her one vote short -- and her options looked limited. West Virginia Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller said Monday night that he was a no vote. Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said Tuesday that he wouldn't support it. ""Congress is not -- nor should it be -- in the business of legislating the approval or disapproval of a construction project,"" King said in a statement. After the vote, five anti-Keystone protestors in the Senate gallery interrupted with chants and cheers. They were removed by police -- and the Senate moved on without a speech that had been expected from Landrieu.","Senate blocks Keystone bill .

""It is an important moment in the life of our nation, but I suppose above all, it's a wonderful moment for a warm and loving couple who got a brand new baby boy,"" he said. The new parents spent some time with their baby before calling family members -- starting with Queen Elizabeth II -- to announce the birth, a Kensington Palace source told CNN royal correspondent Max Foster. Prince William remained at Catherine's side throughout the labor and the baby was born vaginally, not via a C-section, the source said. ""We could not be happier,"" said Prince William, according to the Kensington Palace source. Queen Ella? King Terry? What's in a royal name? The royal couple remained in hospital overnight but hopes were high that they'd make an appearance as early as Tuesday. A multigun salute is set to happen that day to mark the birth. ""Both my wife and I are overjoyed at the arrival of my first grandchild. It is an incredibly special moment for William and Catherine, and we are so thrilled for them on the birth of their baby boy,"" Prince Charles and wife Camilla said in a statement. Earlier Monday, the duchess and Prince William traveled by car from Kensington Palace to the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital. The hospital, next to Paddington Station in London, is where William and his brother Prince Harry were born. Photos: House of Windsor babies . The baby's name may be announced when the family leaves the hospital, CNN's Foster reported. Prince William's name was announced a few days after birth, his brother Harry's on departure from hospital. Some British parents have delayed naming their newborns in recent days in hopes of either copying or avoiding the royal name, he said. British bookmakers favor the names James and George. The child's title will be His Royal Highness Prince (the baby's name) of Cambridge. The baby is third in line for the throne now occupied by the queen. Her son, Charles, will succeed her, followed by his son, William. The queen returned to Buckingham Palace on Monday from Windsor Castle, another of her official residences. Thanks to a change agreed by the leaders of the Commonwealth countries in 2011 and passed into law this year, the baby's place in the order of succession would have been the same regardless of sex. World chuckles about #RoyalBaby . Previously, boys automatically trumped female siblings. So a first-born daughter could be pushed out of line by a younger brother. The British monarch is also head of state in 15 Commonwealth countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Belize and Jamaica. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper offered his country's congratulations. ""The arrival of the newest member of the Royal Family, a future Sovereign of Canada, is a highly anticipated moment for Canadians given the special and warm relationship that we share with our Royal Family,"" he said in a statement. Barack and Michelle Obama also gave their best wishes. ""The child enters the world at a time of promise and opportunity for our two nations,"" the president and first lady said in a statement. ""Given the special relationship between us, the American people are pleased to join with the people of the United Kingdom as they celebrate the birth of the young prince."" Opinion: How to raise a royal baby . The royal birth is expected to be good for business. The UK-based Centre for Retail Research estimates retailers will sell $121 million worth of royal-related baby toys and souvenirs. Merchandise ranges from diaper covers and clothing to a ""prince potty chair,"" which of course is in the shape of a throne. On Twitter, topics related to the royal baby jumped to the top of the trending list in the United Kingdom Monday morning. Worldwide, hashtags such as #RoyalBabyBoy and #Will & Kate were trending later in the day. Many tweets were along the lines of the comment of Holly Thrift, who wrote, ""The royal baby is coming! I am freaking out!"" The baby was the only topic on the radio talk show hosted by Vanessa Feltz on BBC London 94.9 on Monday morning. But not everyone was thrilled. Feltz read on air a message from ""Gary"" asking, ""Please, please please, I implore you not to devote too much of the morning's show to the royal baby."" Feltz replied, ""C'mon, Gary, give an inch. .... It's huge, we can't ignore it."" She reported Gary sent another message: ""OK, point taken. I'm a beaten man."" Confused about the royals?

"The picture emerging of the dead gunman in Monday's rampage at the Washington Navy Yard is a study in contrasts, one of a man who practiced languages and meditated, and another of a cold-blooded killer. The gunman was identified as 34-year-old Aaron Alexis, a former Navy reservist and a current military contractor, the Washington FBI Field Office told CNN. His identity was confirmed by fingerprints and a picture ID card, the FBI said. Authorities have not released a possible motive in the morning shooting at the headquarters for Naval Sea Systems Command that left 12 people -- and the gunman -- dead. But a friend said Alexis was locked in a dispute over money with the company that contracted him to work for the Navy. Investigators also learned that Alexis had recently made contact with two Veterans Administration hospitals for apparent psychological issues, law enforcement sources told CNN on Tuesday. Authorities said earlier that they are confident that Alexis was the lone gunman, bringing to an end a daylong police search for a possible second suspect. Gaining access . Alexis was carrying a military-contractor ID that matched his appearance, a D.C. Metropolitan Police official told CNN on condition of anonymity. Alexis used that ID to gain access to the Navy Yard, according to a U.S. law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation. He drove onto the installation and parked before walking a short distance to Building 197. Once inside, according to the official, Alexis made his way to an overlook above the atrium and opened fire into the cafeteria. What is security like at Washington Navy Yard? Initial reports said Alexis used an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle during the attack, but by Tuesday, law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation said that was not the case. It is believed that Alexis had rented an AR-15, but returned it before Monday's shooting, the officials said. Investigators have recovered three weapons from the scene, including a shotgun that Alexis is believed to have brought into the compound. The other two weapons -- handguns -- the sources say, may have been taken from guards. While the FBI was urging anyone with information about Alexis to come forward, investigators were focusing on reported incidents, including police run-ins, that portray a man with increasingly violent tendencies. Employment . Alexis was believed to have arrived in the Washington area last week, when he reportedly checked into a hotel, according to someone who met him at the hotel. The person, who declined to be identified, said Alexis indicated that he planned to be in the area for several weeks. Who are the victims? At the time of the shooting, Alexis was working for The Experts, a subcontractor of HP Enterprise Services that was contracted to ""refresh equipment used on the Navy Marine Corps Intranet network,"" according to a statement released by the company. Alexis, who had Department of Defense security clearance, worked from September 2012 through January refreshing computer systems in Japan, said Thomas E. Hoshko, the CEO of The Experts. His security clearance was renewed in July to carry out the same type of contract work at the Navy Yard, Hoshko said. Alexis returned to work with The Experts that same month, he said. He worked at facilities in Rhode Island, North Carolina and Virginia for weeks at a time upgrading computer systems, Hoshko said. No one reported having any problems with Alexis during those assignments, the chief executive said. Alexis began working at the Navy Yard last week, though it was unclear whether he had actually begun working or was still securing his base clearance, Hoshko said. Many surprised . There were no indications that Alexis had any ideological differences with the Navy or any disagreements with anyone at the Navy Yard, the U.S. law enforcement official said. Alexis' family reeled at the news that he was believed to be the man behind the killings. ""What I do know is he wasn't that type of person,"" Anthony Little, who identified himself as Alexis' brother-in-law, told reporters outside his Brooklyn, New York, home. ""I didn't really hear anything that would make me feel, as a newcomer to the family, that somebody should be watching him."" He said the family's initial reaction was ""very distraught, very stressed out, tears."" ""You know, they didn't see it coming,"" said Little, who is married to Alexis' sister Naomi. ""Their hearts are going out more to the victims and the people that got hurt because, you know, there's more lives lost and we don't need that right now. We really don't."" Opinion: What could have prevented Navy Yard carnage? Navy reservist . Alexis, who was from New York City, served as a full-time Navy reservist between 2007 and 2011, according to military records. In the Navy, he achieved the rank of aviation electrician's mate 3rd class, working on aircraft electrical systems, the records show. Alexis was honorably discharged after a ""pattern of misconduct,"" a U.S. defense official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on condition of anonymity. The official did not detail the misconduct. Most recently, Alexis worked as an information technology contractor with the Navy, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Legal run-ins . Alexis appeared to have had sporadic run-ins with the law, dating back to at least 2004 when he was arrested in Seattle, accused of shooting out the tires of a man's truck in an anger-fueled ""blackout,"" according to a Seattle Police Department report. He told investigators he believed the man, a construction worker, was mocking him, but had no memory of shooting out the tires, the report said. Investigators later spoke with Alexis' father, who told police that his son had anger management problems associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, which he suffered after working ""as an active participant in rescue attempts"" during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York, the report said. Alexis was arrested in August 2008 on a charge of disorderly conduct in DeKalb County, Georgia, county police said Tuesday. And in 2010, Alexis was arrested by Fort Worth, Texas, police but never charged over an allegation that he fired a gun through the ceiling of his apartment. According to records, he told police he accidentally fired it while cleaning it. Witness: ""He aimed his gun at us"" Good friends . His last known address was outside of Fort Worth, where he was roommates for three years with Nutpisit Suthamtewakul, who described Alexis as his best friend. Alexis befriended Suthamtewakul four years ago after he emigrated from Thailand. Alexis taught him about American culture, Suthamtewakul told CNN. Alexis, he says, was fluent in Thai and attended a Buddhist temple. When Suthamtewakul opened the Happy Bowl Thai Restaurant, Alexis would occasionally help out, waiting tables, he said. The two were roommates until five months ago, when Suthamtewakul got married and Alexis had to move out. Toward the end, Alexis spent a lot of time holed up in his room, keeping to himself, Suthamtewakul said. On Monday, Suthamtewakul was stunned by the news that Alexis was said to be the shooter in the rampage at the Navy Yard. ""I can't believe he did this,"" he said. ""He never showed any sign of violence."" Frustrations . But there were signs that Alexis was unhappy. He was having a hard time trying to get on his feet, said Suthamtewakul's wife, Kristi. He helped out at the restaurant but not for pay. ""He was using this as an educational experience to help learn Thai,"" she said. He enjoyed making deliveries to homes, where the language was spoken. He talked about moving to Thailand. But to Suthamtewakul, Alexis seemed ""frustrated with life."" She is grieving. ""He was like one of our best friends, like a brother to us and always willing to go out of his way to help us out with things."" He was very frustrated with the company that contracted him to work for the Navy, according to another friend. Alexis claimed he wasn't paid properly by the company after returning from a months-long assignment to Japan last year, said Michael Ritrovato, another former roommate. It was unclear whether the dispute was over salary or expenses. Alexis just felt the company owed him money and had not paid him, Ritrovato said. Gun knowledge . He is in shock over his friend's actions. ""He was an easygoing guy. I don't know of any reason for this,"" he said. But Ritrovato knew Alexis was fascinated by guns. ""He was ... knowledgeable with military rifles and handguns. At least he led us to believe he was. But nobody ever had the idea that he would use them in a derogatory way,"" he said. It is not clear whether Alexis was still living in Fort Worth area at the time of the shooting.","A friend says Alexis was frustrated with life .

"Sen. Mark Udall apologized Monday for saying that the two beheaded U.S. journalists would agree the U.S. shouldn't ""be impulsive"" in dealing with ISIS. ""I should not have invoked the names of James Foley and Steven Sotloff. It was inappropriate and I sincerely apologize,"" the Colorado Democrat said in a statement. The two men were executed in the past month, with their ISIS killers vowing to do more harm if the U.S. maintained its targeted air strikes against the militant group. Terror fears could help GOP in midterms . Udall, who faces a competitive re-election bid this fall, made the original comments during a debate Saturday while warning against rushing into further action beyond the current air strikes in Iraq. ""Steve Sotloff and James Foley would tell us, 'Don't be impulsive,'"" Udall said at the debate, as seen on video published by National Review Online. ""Horrible and barbarous as those executions were, don't be impulsive, come up with a plan to knock (ISIS) back."" In his statement Monday, Udall said his ""intent was to emphasize the importance of taking the right next steps as we confront this serious threat."" Udall, who sits on the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence committees, also has received criticism for arguing that ISIS is not ""an immediate threat to the homeland."" Obama's 'core coalition' won't defeat ISIS without Mideast . His views are at odds with a majority of the country. According to a new CNN/ORC International poll, seven in 10 Americans believe ISIS has the resources to launch an attack against the U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner, the GOP Senate nominee who's challenging Udall, lambasted Udall's comments from the debate, saying ""it's outrageous that Senator Udall would put words into the mouths of dead Americans."" Garner also hit Udall for not viewing ISIS as ""an imminent threat to America."" Answering critics, Udall said in his statement Monday ""these terrorists are a serious threat to U.S. interests and allies in the Middle East, and Americans are counting on their leaders to get this right.""

"As far as hurricanes go, Sandy is not particularly intense. With peak winds at 90 mph Monday at 5 p.m., it is still classified as a Category One, with only a small chance of briefly achieving the low end of Category Two before making landfall somewhere in New Jersey on Monday evening. And yet, state and local governments have gone into full alert mode, with schools closed, cities shut down, and evacuations ordered across the Eastern Seaboard. Justifying the alarm are enormous waves arriving onshore, raising the mean water level by a few feet even here in Miami, where the winds are blowing directly offshore. Sandy could bring 'catastrophe,' affect 60 million . Sandy represents the confluence of a modestly strong hurricane coming up from the Caribbean and a fairly strong but not unusual continental weather system -- what meteorologists call a ""trough"" or ""dip"" in the jet stream -- that has been traversing the country over the last few days. In the vast majority of cases, these weather systems weaken hurricanes while at the same time pushing them quickly out to sea. Such weather systems also generate their own cyclones, not as intense as hurricanes, but larger and slower moving. Opinion: As Sandy descends, tips from Katrina survivors . When these extra-tropical cyclones form over the ocean and move along the coast, we call them nor'easters (for the strong northeasterly winds they generate).  Sometimes, tropical and extra-tropical systems merge, and the hurricane turns into a large ocean cyclone. But again, almost all of these storms move quickly out to sea. There are two elements that make Sandy very unusual, possibly even ""super."" First is its pathway. Rather than racing out to sea like most coastal storms, Sandy has already turned hard to the left and it will make landfall at nearly a right angle to the U.S. coastline. This extremely unusual track (from right to left) means that almost every piece of coastline from New Jersey to Cape Cod will receive onshore winds at some point during the event. Second, the core of Sandy -- the part that will look and feel like a hurricane -- has remained intact, even as cooler and drier air from the United States wraps around it. Thus, Sandy has each of the worst features of both kinds of storm: a small core of hurricane-force winds around its center, and a broad expanse of gale-force winds extending hundreds of miles outward that will batter the shorelines for several days. Why did this happen? It was simply a matter of positioning. Sandy arrived east of Florida at exactly the right time and place to get the maximum benefits from its interaction with the dip in the jet stream. As a result, Sandy became large enough to influence that system as well, and the two will wrap around each other into a single, deep cyclone, 800 miles across, extending from the ground to 40,000 feet in the sky. This will add to the duration of the event as the circulation takes several days to wind down over Pennsylvania and New York. Opinion: Climate change raises stakes for coast . As for whether Sandy is a ""Superstorm,"" perhaps we should refrain from such a designation until after the event. There was already a ""Superstorm"" in March 1993 -- a nor'easter that dumped snow from New Orleans to Canada. There was the Halloween Storm of 1991 -- later known as the Perfect Storm -- which, like Sandy, also grew from the confluence of a large extra-tropical cyclone and a hurricane (which, unlike Sandy, was destroyed in the process). And there was the Blizzard of '78, the Eastcoaster of 1996, and others. Sandy will take its place in history, but we will not know what that place is until many days have passed.","David Nolan: As far as hurricanes go, the storm we call ""Sandy"" is not very intense .
Nolan: There are two elements that make Sandy unusual, possibly even ""super""

"(CNN) -- On New Year's Day, after months of suffering from debilitating headaches, I learned that I had brain cancer. I was 29 years old. I'd been married for just over a year. My husband and I were trying for a family. Our lives devolved into hospital stays, doctor consultations and medical research. Nine days after my initial diagnoses, I had a partial craniotomy and a partial resection of my temporal lobe. Both surgeries were an effort to stop the growth of my tumor. In April, I learned that not only had my tumor come back, but it was more aggressive. Doctors gave me a prognosis of six months to live. Because my tumor is so large, doctors prescribed full brain radiation. I read about the side effects: The hair on my scalp would have been singed off. My scalp would be left covered with first-degree burns. My quality of life, as I knew it, would be gone. After months of research, my family and I reached a heartbreaking conclusion: There is no treatment that would save my life, and the recommended treatments would have destroyed the time I had left. I considered passing away in hospice care at my San Francisco Bay-area home. But even with palliative medication, I could develop potentially morphine-resistant pain and suffer personality changes and verbal, cognitive and motor loss of virtually any kind. Because the rest of my body is young and healthy, I am likely to physically hang on for a long time even though cancer is eating my mind. I probably would have suffered in hospice care for weeks or even months. And my family would have had to watch that. I did not want this nightmare scenario for my family, so I started researching death with dignity. It is an end-of-life option for mentally competent, terminally ill patients with a prognosis of six months or less to live. It would enable me to use the medical practice of aid in dying: I could request and receive a prescription from a physician for medication that I could self-ingest to end my dying process if it becomes unbearable. I quickly decided that death with dignity was the best option for me and my family. We had to uproot from California to Oregon, because Oregon is one of only five states where death with dignity is authorized. I met the criteria for death with dignity in Oregon, but establishing residency in the state to make use of the law required a monumental number of changes. I had to find new physicians, establish residency in Portland, search for a new home, obtain a new driver's license, change my voter registration and enlist people to take care of our animals, and my husband, Dan, had to take a leave of absence from his job. The vast majority of families do not have the flexibility, resources and time to make all these changes. I've had the medication for weeks. I am not suicidal. If I were, I would have consumed that medication long ago. I do not want to die. But I am dying. And I want to die on my own terms. Brittany Maynard, advocate for 'death with dignity,' dies . I would not tell anyone else that he or she should choose death with dignity. My question is: Who has the right to tell me that I don't deserve this choice? That I deserve to suffer for weeks or months in tremendous amounts of physical and emotional pain? Why should anyone have the right to make that choice for me? Opinion: When assisted suicide is not the answer . Now that I've had the prescription filled and it's in my possession, I have experienced a tremendous sense of relief. And if I decide to change my mind about taking the medication, I will not take it. Having this choice at the end of my life has become incredibly important. It has given me a sense of peace during a tumultuous time that otherwise would be dominated by fear, uncertainty and pain. Now, I'm able to move forward in my remaining days or weeks I have on this beautiful Earth, to seek joy and love and to spend time traveling to outdoor wonders of nature with those I love. And I know that I have a safety net. Dying young and on her own terms . I plan to celebrate my husband's birthday on October 26 with him and our family. Unless my condition improves dramatically, I will look to pass soon thereafter. I hope for the sake of my fellow American citizens that I'll never meet that this option is available to you. If you ever find yourself walking a mile in my shoes, I hope that you would at least be given the same choice and that no one tries to take it from you. When my suffering becomes too great, I can say to all those I love, ""I love you; come be by my side, and come say goodbye as I pass into whatever's next."" I will die upstairs in my bedroom with my husband, mother, stepfather and best friend by my side and pass peacefully. I can't imagine trying to rob anyone else of that choice.

"Israeli police clashed with Palestinians at one of the holiest sites in Judaism and Islam on Wednesday, leaving more than 15 people injured in the latest round of unrest at the compound in Jerusalem. Groups of young Palestinians threw stones and set off fireworks at Israeli police officers near one of the gates of the Temple Mount -- known by Muslims as Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary) -- when the site was opened to visitors, police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. The Palestinians were pushed back into the site's al-Aqsa Mosque, Samri said. In an attempt to control the violence, police closed access to the compound. Eyewitnesses among Muslim worshippers at the site gave a different version of events, saying hundreds of police officers raided the compound, throwing stun grenades into the mosque in an effort to clear a way to the area for Jewish protesters. Jordan recalled its ambassador to Israel on Wednesday in protest of ""increasing Israeli escalation"" at the Noble Sanctuary, Jordan's state news agency, Petra, reported. Jordanian Prime Minister Abdullah Ensour also instructed Jordan's foreign affairs minister to submit a complaint to the United Nations Security Council about Israeli ""attacks"" on the Noble Sanctuary, according to Petra. The Jewish protesters were attending a support rally for Rabbi Yehuda Glick, a right-wing activist who was shot and gravely wounded by a Palestinian last week. The shooting helped to ratchet up tensions in Jerusalem and prompted Israeli authorities to close the Temple Mount for one day -- a move that outraged Palestinians. Israeli police officer killed, 13 hurt in driver's rampage . Samri said the youths had gathered in the mosque overnight, amassing rocks, fireworks and Molotov cocktails with which to attack police. ""Inside the mosque they formed obstacles to hide behind,"" she said. ""There were violent clashes with the police."" Police went several meters into the mosque in order to clear obstacles preventing them from closing the door, Samri said, adding that Jews and tourists were now allowed back to the site. But unrest flared again later near another gate, when police threw stun grenades and fired rubber bullets at Muslim worshippers who were chanting and praying because they weren't allowed back into the site. Paramedics from the Red Crescent at the scene told CNN that 15 people were injured, one of them with a serious injury to the eye. Samri said police officers were injured. Also in eastern Jerusalem on Wednesday, the driver of a commercial van ran over pedestrians at a rail station, killing an Israeli border police officer and injuring 13 other people, police said. Police shot and killed the attacker. No motive for the van attack was immediately released, but the Islamist movement Hamas supported it in a text message to the news media: ""Hamas blesses the action. What is happening in Jerusalem is pushing us to prepare for war."" Recent tension at the holy site . The Temple Mount, or Haram al-Sharif, is the holiest site in Judaism and one of the three holiest sites in Islam. Some of the recent tension over the Temple Mount centers on Glick, who has long argued that Jews must have a place of worship on the Temple Mount. Jews now have the right to visit the site but cannot pray there. The drive by Glick and others to enable Jews to pray there is a sensitive issue for Muslims, who suspect a plan to expel them from the site. Glick was shot on October 29 as he left a Jerusalem conference called ""The Jewish people return to the Temple Mount."" Glick's assailant, Mutaz Hijazi, was shot dead by an Israeli counter-terror unit hours later. Hundreds of Palestinians attended Hijazi's funeral. Israeli authorities reacted to Glick's shooting by closing al-Aqsa Mosque on October 30, then restricting its access by allowing entry only by men over 50 years of age and women, and putting thousands more police on the streets. The Palestinian Authority described the closure -- the first in 14 years -- as a ""declaration of war."" There were also harsh words from Jordan, which remains the custodian of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem according to its peace treaty with Israel. On Wednesday, a spokesman for the military wing of Hamas said that al-Aqsa Mosque ""is the detonator needed to ignite a volcano in the face of the cowardly and treacherous occupier."" ""We salute the heroes of the mujahideen of Hamas,"" Abu Abiada said in a message posted on the military wing's website. Place for Muslim prophet, Hebrew patriarch . With its golden dome overlooking Jerusalem, the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif site is said to have hosted sacred events in both the Jewish and Muslim religions. Jewish tradition holds that the Temple Mount contains Mount Moriah, where Abraham, the Hebrew patriarch, is said to have nearly sacrificed his son -- under God's orders -- before an angel intervened. Later, Israeli King Solomon constructed the first Jewish temple on the mount, including the Holy of Holies, a room that kept the Ark of the Covenant, which was said to contain the tablets on which God wrote the Ten Commandments. Muslims believe that the Prophet Mohammed was carried on a flying steed from Mecca to the Jerusalem site during his miraculous Night Journey, according to Muqtedar Khan, an expert on Islam and politics at the University of Delaware. According to Islamic tradition, the Night Journey took Mohammed to the same Jerusalem rock on which Abraham nearly sacrificed his son, where the Muslim founder led Abraham, Moses and Jesus in prayers as the last of God's prophets. That rock is now said to sit in the Dome of the Rock, whose golden roof gleams above the Old City skyline. Since its construction in the seventh century, the Haram al-Sharif, now controlled by an Islamic trust, has been an almost constant source of tension between Muslims and Jews.","Jordan recalls ambassador to Israel to protest ""increasing Israeli escalation""

"Threatening your guests rarely yields smiley happy reviews. It's a lesson Union Street Guest House in Hudson, New York, learned Monday after the New York Post highlighted the hotel's attempt to fine wedding parties $500 for any negative online reviews posted by any members of their parties. Hundreds of people took to Yelp.com on Monday to complain about the policy and write mostly fake, eviscerating reviews of the property. At one point Monday there were more than 700 reviews on Yelp, but the company had deleted many reviews by Monday afternoon because they didn't reflect ""first-hand experiences,"" according to Yelp. ""Trying to prevent your customers from talking about their experiences is bad policy and, in this case, likely unenforceable anyway,"" Yelp said. Screen shots of the policy, which had been removed from the hotel website as of Monday afternoon, read ""there will be a $500 fine that will be deducted from your deposit for every negative review of USGH placed on any Internet site by anyone in your party and/or attending your wedding or event."" Apparently guests who don't like their stays at the guest house just don't understand the historic buildings or region, according to the hotel website. ""Please know that despite the fact that wedding couples love Hudson and our Inn, your friends and families may not,"" the website says. ""This is due to the fact that your guests may not understand what we offer -- therefore we expect you to explain that to them. USGH & Hudson are historic. The buildings here are old (but restored). ""Our bathrooms and kitchens are designed to look old in an artistic 'vintage' way. Our furniture is mostly hip, period furniture that you would see in many design magazines. (although comfortable and functional -- obviously all beds are brand new.) If your guests are looking for a Marriott type hotel they may not like it here."" CNN.com called the inn repeatedly but only reached a busy signal, and an e-mailed request for comment was not returned. The inn posted an explanation on its Facebook page, which was later removed. ""The policy regarding wedding fines was put on our site as a tongue-in-cheek response to a wedding many years ago. It was meant to be taken down long ago and certainly was never enforced,"" the post said. But one Yelp reviewer posted complaints about the policy last year after he posted a negative Yelp review. ""The management of this hotel had the gall to email us twice to threaten us financially about the negative review!"" wrote one reviewer, whose Yelp handle is Rabih Z. He continues: ""Here is an excerpt from their first email: 'please note that your recent on-line review of our Inn will cost the wedding party that left us a deposit $500. This money be charged via the deposit they have left us unless/until it is removed.  Any other or future reviews will also be charged to the wedding party (bride & groom) from the guarantee they have provided us.'"" Other parts of the hotel's website are a little cranky, too. One example: ""We reserve the right to cancel a reservation at any time for any reason."" Another policy about cancellations: ""If your stay is longer than 3 days we do not accept cancellations of any kind."" Positive online reviews equal more hotel revenue, said Josiah Mackenzie, director of ReviewPro, an online hospitality reputation management company. ""The answer is not to fine guests but to use feedback to make changes in your operations,"" he told CNN. ""That leads to guests having happier experiences and sharing these reviews on these review sites.""","A Hudson, New York, inn had a policy on its website imposing a fine for bad online reviews .

"Score one for the power of social media. What started out as a simple Facebook post in early March became an improbable family reunion this week. Katheryn Deprill, known as the ""Burger King baby"" after she was abandoned in a restroom as an hours-old newborn in Allentown, Pennsylvania, 27 years ago, reached out to her birth mother by making a simple request. ""I want her to know that I am not mad at her for what she did, however I have so many questions to ask her and also to start a relationship with my biological mother."" ""Please help me find her by sharing my post,"" she added. ""Maybe she will see this."" She did. And on Monday, the two women met. ""They immediately hugged,"" said Jim Waldron, an attorney who arranged the meeting at the request of Deprill's birth mother told CNN affiliate WFMZ. ""It was exciting, emotional, dramatic."" 'She had no other means' Waldron said Deprill's birth mother had been raped while traveling in another country and become pregnant.  She was able to keep the pregnancy a secret from her parents, but knew she couldn't take care of the baby. ""She left the baby in a location where the baby would be found and cared for,"" Waldron said.  ""She kissed the baby on the forehead ... and left."" Deprill told the affiliate her mother ""was extremely upset that she had to leave me and it wasn't what she wanted, but she felt she had no other means. She was only 17 years old. ""She left me somewhere she knew I'd be found. She did not want to throw me away."" Outpouring of emotions . The reunion was also attended by Deprill's adoptive mom and her birth mom's husband. Deprill declined to identify her birth mom, saying ""she did not want to be in the limelight."" The meeting sparked an outpouring of emotions on Facebook. ""So happy you found your biological mom and send hugs to your adoptive mom for not trying to prevent it,"" posted Kathleen Canavan-Hurley.  ""She must be a lovely lady to stand beside you and encourage your decisions."" ""So happy for both of you! I hope this is the beginning of a wonderful relationship!"" Monica Ellis-Applegate said. It just might be. Deprill told the affiliate that her birth mother wants to be involved  her life, and she hopes they'll meet again soon. After 18 years, missing son reunites with father .

"Eating out can be such a pleasure: Someone else chops the veggies, cooks the entree and brings it steaming hot to your table, while you enjoy time with friends or family. But when we eat out, we tend to overdo it. While an occasional splurge is OK, if we're not smart about our menu choices, we may be hunting for a larger wardrobe. On average, Americans eat out about five times a week, according to the National Restaurant Association. Because those meals are generally higher in calories and fat than what we make at home, they can create a recipe for weight gain. Every meal away from home increases an adult's average daily calorie count by about 135 calories, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. If we eat out five times a week, we stand to gain up to 10 pounds a year. Business traveler Tish Davis frequently meets with clients over meals, and she's seen her weight climb by about 20 pounds in the past few years. Registered dietitian Marisa Moore gave Davis some advice on how to eat healthy while on the road. Davis knows she has some weaknesses. ""I love things that are fried, like bacon, a burger, chicken tenders. I like crunchy,"" she says. 7 foods that fight fat . Moore offered Davis some tips -- and gave her some homework to help with her eating habits. Order first . Davis says she goes into the meal intending to eat healthy, but by the time she hears what others are ordering, she's lost her resolve.  Moore suggests that Davis order first. ""There is an interesting study that shows that women tend to mirror each other when we go out to eat,"" Moore says. ""If you order your meal first, before everybody else starts to order, then you might actually set the tone for the table to order healthier options."" And, if possible, try to choose the restaurant where you'll meet friends or business associates. Look for places that have healthy options on the menu so you'll have better choices. Red flags . When you sit down to order, scrutinize the menu for red flags that indicate foods are high in calories: descriptions of creamy, crispy, fried, breaded or smothered. ""Instead, you want to opt for foods that are grilled, steamed or broiled. That generally is going to be a healthier cooking method,"" Moore says. Tailor the meal . Don't be afraid to ask the server to make changes to the menu.  Replace unhealthy sides such as french fries for steamed vegetables. If you know a sauce is going to be loaded with calories, ask that it be brought on the side. You tend to eat less that way. And always order your salad dressing on the side, Moore says. Though dressing can be healthy, restaurants tend to give us two to three times the amount we need, and those calories can add up. If you're ordering pizza, ask the chef to go light on the cheese. Box it up . A restaurant serving can usually feed two, so at the beginning of the meal, ask the server for a to-go box. Put half of the meal away and take it home with you -- if food is in front of us, we tend to eat it, even when we're full. Gut-busting restaurant meals named 'dis-honorees' Soup and salad . Another way to keep from overeating is to order a salad or broth-based soup as your first course, Moore says. ""There is some evidence to show that people who eat a broth-based soup or a veggie salad before their meal tend to eat fewer calories for the entire meal."" Portion control . On average, Americans need about 2,000 calories a day, and knowing how to judge a portion size can help us stick to that target.  If you're ordering pasta, a good rule of thumb is to eat a portion that looks to be about the size of your fist.  With meat, try not to eat more than would fit in the palm of your hand. To help Davis with portion control, Moore suggests she order an appetizer in place of an entree. Slow down . We've heard it before, but when we eat too fast, we often eat too much. ""It takes about 20 minutes for your brain to realize that your body is full,"" Moore says. So slow down. Enjoy the company of those you're with, and try putting your fork down between bites. It might take a little practice, but it does make for a more leisurely meal. Rethink the drink . It's easy to forget about the calories from the drink we order, whether it's an alcoholic beverage or a glass of tea. One serving of sweetened tea, for instance, can have 200 to 250 calories. ""A glass of wine is only about 150 calories, but some of your mixed drinks can be well over 300 or 350 calories,"" Moore says. She encourages Davis to drink water with her meals and with her occasional glass of wine.  Water helps fill us up, so we tend to consume less alcohol. Can mindfulness curb overeating? One day at a time . ""I'm actually going to try some things ... when I'm on the road,"" Davis says. ""I'm going to just pay more attention to the menu and go for the broiled, not the fried, and start with a salad."" But she knows she's going to struggle with her biggest challenge. ""My lack of willpower in peer settings -- that's my biggest downfall,"" Davis says. It's all about choices, Moore says. ""We have to be prepared to face those obstacles, those temptations and decide when you're going to splurge and when you're going to make sure that you stick to a healthy diet.""","American eat out about five times a week, statistics show .

"One of the jurors who acquitted George Zimmerman said she had ""no doubt"" he feared for his life in the final moments of his struggle with Trayvon Martin, and that was the definitive factor in the verdict. The woman, who was identified just as Juror B37, spoke exclusively to CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on Monday night. She is the first juror to speak publicly about the case. She said she believes Zimmerman's ""heart was in the right place"" the night he shot Martin, but that he didn't use ""good judgment"" in confronting the Florida teen. ""I think George Zimmerman is a man whose heart was in the right place, but just got displaced by the vandalism in the neighborhoods, and wanting to catch these people so badly that he went above and beyond what he really should have done,"" she said. Fringe protesters turn violent in LA after Zimmerman verdict . ""But I think his heart was in the right place. It just went terribly wrong."" If anything, Zimmerman was guilty of not using ""good judgment,"" the juror said. ""When he was in the car, and he had called 911, he shouldn't have gotten out of that car,"" she said. She also said she believes Martin threw the first punch in the confrontation that followed. ""I think George got in a little bit too deep, which he shouldn't have been there. But Trayvon decided that he wasn't going to let him scare him ... and I think Trayvon got mad and attacked him,"" she said. Zimmerman felt his life was in danger before shooting Martin, and it was his voice that was heard screaming for help in 911 calls, the juror said she believes. ""He had a right to defend himself,"" she said. ""If he felt threatened that his life was going to be taken away from him, or he was going to have bodily harm, he had a right."" Race perhaps simplest disagreement in post-trial CNN interviews . Split vote . An initial vote was divided. Three of the jurors first voted Zimmerman was guilty, while three voted he was not guilty, she said. Juror B37 was among those who believed he was not guilty from the start. ""There was a couple of them in there that wanted to find him guilty of something and after hours and hours and hours of deliberating over the law, and reading it over and over and over again, we decided there's just no way, other place to go,"" she said. Jurors were not identified by name during the trial, which sparked a broad debate about gun laws and race in America. The juror said she did not believe Zimmerman profiled Martin, who was African-American, because of the color of his skin. Now that he's free, can Zimmerman make a living? She believes he thought Martin was suspicious because of the way he acted. ""Anybody would think anybody walking down the road, stopping and turning and looking -- if that's exactly what happened -- is suspicious,"" she said. ""I think all of us thought race did not play a role,"" the juror said . ""We never had that discussion."" Juror: Jeantel wasn't a good witness . At one point during the interview, she grew emotional and her voice cracked. She said jurors cried after putting in their vote. ""It's a tragedy this happened. But it happened,"" the juror said. ""And I think both were responsible for the situation they had gotten themselves into. I think both of them could have walked away. It just didn't happen."" Martin's friend 'upset, angry' by verdict . Book plans canceled . The juror was planning to write a book about her experience with the case, literary agent Sharlene Martin said before her interview aired. But hours later, the agent released a statement from Juror B37 saying she would no longer write one. ""Now that I am returned to my family and to society in general, I have realized that the best direction for me to go is away from writing any sort of book and return instead to my life as it was before I was called to sit on this jury,"" the juror said.

"This one was big but it's not the Big One. An 8.2-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of northern Chile Tuesday night, triggering small landslides, setting off a tsunami and killing at least five people. But geologists say an even larger quake in the region is lurking. ""This magnitude 8.2 is not the large earthquake that we were expecting in this area,"" said Mark Simons, a geophysicist at Caltech in Pasadena, California. ""We're expecting a potentially even larger earthquake."" It could be tomorrow. Or it could be 50 years. ""We do not know when it's going to occur,"" he said. Here's why: . Chile sits on an arc of volcanos and fault lines circling the Pacific Ocean known as the ""Ring of Fire."" This area sees frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The country itself has seen no shortage of seismic activity in recent years. Since 1973, Chile has had more than a dozen quakes of magnitude-7.0 and above. Powerful earthquake strikes off Chile, triggers tsunami . In 2010, about 500 people died when an 8.8-magnitude earthquake hit. That quake was so violent, it moved one whole city about 10 feet west. Simons says Tuesday's quake is of interest because the fault line along Chile's coast has constantly shifted during the last 140 years. In recent weeks, this area has seen a cluster of activity-- something like 50 to 100 smaller quakes. Then, late last month, a 6.7 and a 6.1 magnitude quake struck. When quakes happen, the surface ruptures. The two sides of the fault slip past each other. But the area to the north and south of Tuesday's quake ""did not rupture in this event,"" Simons said. And it's ""still an area that hasn't ruptured in 140-odd years."" Given that it's an area of frequent quakes, and frequent ruptures, it may only be a matter of time. ""We expect another 8.8-8.9 earthquake here sometime in the future,"" Simons said. The good news? ""It may not occur for many, many years."" What you need to know about earthquakes .

"A former University of North Carolina football player has become the first to sue the university over an 18-year academic scandal that kept athletes eligible to play sports by taking classes that never met. Mike McAdoo was a football player who lost his eligibility in 2011 when he was accused of getting too much help with a paper, and was one of the first athletes revealed to have taken part in ""paper classes,"" for which the only requirement was completing a single paper. Now he's suing the university in federal court, saying UNC broke its promise to give him an education in return for playing sports. His lawsuit is a class-action suit that the other 3,100 students who enrolled in the fake classes -- nearly half of whom are athletes -- could easily join. ""From selection of a major to selection of courses, the UNC football program controlled football student-athletes' academic track, with the sole purpose of ensuring that football student-athletes were eligible to participate in athletics, rather than actually educating them,"" says his lawsuit, filed Thursday by the law firms of Ferguson, Chambers & Sumter in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Mehri and Skalet in Washington, D.C. ""UNC has reaped substantial profits from football student-athletes' performance for the school, but it has not provided them a legitimate education in return. As such, UNC has breached its contract with Plaintiff and Class members, in violation of North Carolina common law,"" wrote his attorney, Jeremi Duru, who is also a professor of law at the Washington College of Law. On Monday, the school responded to the suit: ""The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill became aware Friday of the lawsuit filed by former student Michael McAdoo. The University will reserve further comment until we've had the opportunity to fully review the claims,"" said Rick White, associate vice chancellor for communications and public affairs at UNC. McAdoo's story . McAdoo, who spoke to CNN earlier this year, says he was recruited by many schools as a high school senior but chose UNC because he was promised a good education. ""When the coaches and academic staff came to my house all the way in Tennessee, you know they, they wasn't even talking football, they was talking academics,"" he told CNN earlier this year. ""So they were saying, 'You know what, we can't promise your son that he's going to go to the NFL, but one thing that we can promise him is that he will get a college degree.'"" That didn't happen. McAdoo lost his eligibility and never graduated, caught up in the paper class scandal that was known to and used by about two dozen administrators, according to a scathing independent report released last month. McAdoo was a pretty good student, but his grades and test scores fell much below the average student admitted to UNC, a top national public school with a reputation for rigorous academics and selective admission. McAdoo's high school GPA was 2.9. Most admitted UNC students have high school GPAs between 3.6 and 4.3, according to the school's website. The report last month by former federal prosecutor Ken Wainstein followed an eight-month investigation and confirmed what whistleblowers had been saying: Many student athletes were admitted to play sports when they were underprepared for college classes at UNC. McAdoo told CNN earlier this year that he felt he was scapegoated in 2011, when he was kicked off the team for cheating. Since 2011, when the fraud first came to light, the university has refused to acknowledge that members of the academic support staff knew about the paper classes and funneled athletes into them in the way that McAdoo described. He insisted they did know, and his story matched that of whistleblower Mary Willingham, who was also disregarded by the university administration for years and is also suing the school. UNC in January: We failed students 'for years' McAdoo told CNN he had expressed interest in studying criminal justice, but was told on his first day of scheduling that he had to pick from three majors that fit his football schedule -- Exercise and Sport Science, Communications, and African-American Studies, where the paper class scandal existed. McAdoo said his predetermined schedule included some of the paper classes. The report done by Wainstein, a partner with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, found that many of the things McAdoo told CNN were true. There were, the report said, nearly 30 staffers and administrators who knew about the paper classes, including McAdoo's academic advisor, Beth Bridger. Then-head football coach Butch Davis also acknowledged knowing about the scheme. ""I lost an education. I lost trust in the school -- someone I thought had my best interest. I definitely lost out on two seasons of football which would have put me in a better situation than I am now,"" McAdoo told CNN shortly after Wainstein's report was made public. In the suit, Duru asks that a judge appoint someone to make sure that student athletes are no longer forced into certain majors as a condition of playing sports. ""We're not trying to vilify UNC, we're trying to restore one of its greatest traditions,"" Duru said. It also seeks some kind of relief for the athletes like McAdoo who did not get the education they were promised. ""Now the key is trying to make it right for those student athletes who were done wrong,"" Duru said. What this could mean . McAdoo's lawsuit could potentially uncover even more than the damning Wainstein investigation, which was by far the most thorough  and provided a slew of information that had previously been discounted by UNC. The difference is in the power of subpoena. McAdoo's lawyers will be able to depose people who declined to talk to Wainstein -- potentially key participants whom Wainstein called out for refusing to cooperate, like the former director of football Cynthia Reynolds and the former interim head football coach Everett Withers. Withers is now a coach at James Madison University and Reynolds is in academics at Cornell. The former associate dean and director of the men's basketball team, Carolyn Cannon, and another counselor for football, Octavus Barnes, also refused to cooperate, according to the Wainstein report. Willingham, who is suing UNC in a whistleblower-related lawsuit, said she also hopes to depose people who were not interviewed by Wainstein's team, such as members of the board of trustees. ""There's still a lot of denial, and Wainstein did not conduct his investigation with anyone under oath, nor did he have subpoena power,"" Willingham said.","Mike McAdoo is a former football player who was involved in the scandal .
He lost his eligibility and says he was cheated out of an education .
A report last month found UNC used fake classes to keep athletes eligible .

"Last week, President Obama's campaign launched a fictional storybook ad called, ""The Life of Julia."" The slide show narrative follows Julia, a cartoon character, from age 3 to age 67 and explains how Obama's policies, from Head Start to Obamacare to mandated contraception coverage to Medicare reform, would provide Julia with a better life than Mitt Romney or Paul Ryan could. Julia is not your typical all-American girl, but an obviously independent, yuppie liberal woman. She goes to public school, graduates college, and becomes a Web designer. She is able to pursue her career because, at age 27, ""her health insurance is required to cover birth control and preventive care, letting Julia focus on her work rather than worry about her health."" At age 31 she ""decides to have a child,"" with no mention of a father or husband. Her son Zachary heads off to a Race to the Top funded public school, while Julia goes on to start her own Web business. She retires at age 67 with Social Security and Medicare supporting her financially and spends her later years volunteering in a community garden. Julia's happily-ever-after tale is remarkably void of reality. Nowhere in her fictional life is it mentioned that Head Start has done little, if anything, to improve elementary education, that she will likely graduate with $25,000 in student loan debt, that she has a 50% chance of being unemployed or underemployed after college, that Medicare and Social Security are headed toward insolvency, and that her share of the national debt is $50,000 and growing. For Republicans, Julia's story might seem like a joke too good to be true, but they should take it very seriously. Because buried within ""The Life of Julia"" is the ideological vision of modern liberalism -- to create a state that takes care of its people from cradle to grave. The story of Julia is a microcosm of Obama's vision for America and emblematic of his view of the government's role in an individual's life. ""The Life of Julia"" has done what many conservatives have failed to do so far -- outline in exacting detail what modern Democratic policy wants for individuals. Here we have Obama's 21st century synthesis of the Great Society, New Deal and New Frontier. Julia's entire life is defined by her interactions with the state. Government is everywhere and each step of her life is tied to a government program. Notably absent in her story is any relationship with a husband, family, church or community, except a ""community"" garden where she works post-retirement. Instead, the state has taken their place and is her primary relationship. As banal and hackneyed as Julia's life of government dependence may seem, many Americans support it. After all, similar promises lured a number of European countries into overreaching and under-supported social safety nets. With the American family less intact than ever  and with single motherhood at historic highs, women like Julia are increasingly left on their own. The idea of government assistance can become more and more attractive to them and even necessary. Democratic policymakers realize that in the absence of self-sustaining family units, government can step in and fill the void. And a government large enough to fill that void can eventually take the place of the family altogether. Cultural commentator Heather Mac Donald recently wrote, ""The single mother has become the cornerstone of Democratic politics."" Julia is the perfect example. In response, conservatives must defend their own cornerstones -- individual liberty, virtue and earned success. Conservatives must make the case that earned success is preferable to government dependency, and that Julia is more likely to achieve success and fulfillment in a good, stable family. As families grow stronger, schools, churches and communities improve, and Julia's chances for success improve, both for herself and her son. But as government grows larger and more intrusive, Julia's personal liberty and opportunities may shrink. Whatever pleasure Republicans may get from jokes or parodies of Julia, the fact is that many women will choose her life, some out of necessity or believing it's necessary. ""The Life of Julia"" should make it obvious that this election is about more than offering Julia a better job and more benefits. Conservatives must be able to provide Julia an alternative vision for a better future. Without it, Julia might have nowhere else to turn but to the government, and that is nothing to laugh about.

"He may be the future king of Britain, but for now Prince George of Cambridge is just a little ""rascal"" according to his proud father Prince William. Sitting in his garden at Kensington Palace on a warm summer day, the Duke of Cambridge, second in line to the British throne, told CNN that George is already quite a character in his first official interview since the birth in London on July 22. ""He's a little bit of a rascal, I'll put it that way,"" William told CNN's Max Foster. ""He either reminds me of my brother or me when I was younger, I'm not sure, but he's doing very well at the moment."" ""He's growing quite quickly actually.  But he's a little fighter -- he wriggles around quite a lot and he doesn't want to go to sleep that much."" William said his wife Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, has been handling more of the night duties with baby George -- and admitted he's looking forward to going back to his job as a Royal Air Force search-and-rescue pilot in order to catch up on some much-needed sleep. ""Well, as a few fathers might know, I'm actually quite looking forward to going back to work (to) get some sleep. So I'm just hoping the first few shifts I go back I don't have any night jobs."" William, dressed casually in blue jeans and a polo shirt, laughed as he described the moment he and Catherine appeared on the steps at the Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital in London to show baby George to the world for the first time. Prince William said: ""I think more shock was the feeling I felt, but I was on such a high anyway, and so was Catherine, about George that really we were happy to show him off to whoever wanted to see him."" ""As any new parent knows, you're only too happy to show off your new child and, you know, proclaim that he is the best looking or the best everything. It's nice that people want to see George -- I'm just glad he wasn't screaming his head off the whole way through,"" he said with a laugh. Royal baby name: The history behind George Alexander Louis . Fathers around the world watched in disbelief as William, surrounded by hundreds of press photographers, deftly secured his son's car seat in the back of his vehicle on the first try -- but the prince admitted there was more than luck involved in the maneuver. ""Believe, me it wasn't my first time,"" William said, ""and I know there's been some speculation about that. I had to practice, I really did -- I was terrified it was going to fall off or the door wasn't going to close properly."" While the pictures of William climbing behind the wheel and driving his young family home from the hospital may have reinforced perceptions that he'll bring a more modern approach to Britain's monarchy, the future king told CNN it was simply more about doing things his way. Opinion: Baby helps make a monarchy matter . He said: ""I am as independent as I want to be, same as Catherine and Harry. We've all grown up differently to other generations and I very much feel if that I can do it myself, I want to do it myself."" ""There are times where you can't do it yourself and the system takes over, or it's appropriate to do things differently.  But I think driving your son and your wife away from hospital was really important to me."" While the future king may have prevailed on the issue of driving his family home, he says he was less successful at avoiding that hallowed tradition of new parenthood: changing the first diaper. ""I did the first nappy, it's a badge of honor,"" he joked. ""I wasn't allowed to get away with that. I had every midwife staring at me, saying: 'You do it, you do it.'"" William told CNN that Catherine is doing ""a fantastic job"" with baby George and that his young family is now his priority. The prince said last week that he will miss living on the Welsh island of Anglesey when his three-year tour as an RAF pilot there comes to an end next month. ""For me, Catherine and now little George are my priorities -- and Lupo,"" the prince said with a smile. Thankfully Lupo, the couple's Cocker Spaniel, seems to be on board with the new addition to the family. ""He's coping all right, actually.  As a lot of people know who have got dogs and bringing a newborn back, they take a little bit of time to adapt, but he's been all right so far.  He's been slobbering around the house a bit, so he's perfectly happy."" One of William's great passions is saving endangered species in Africa. He told CNN he wants George to experience the same Africa he saw as a young man and spark a passion for preserving the unique wildlife there, much as his father, Prince Charles, did with him. ""I'll have toy elephants and rhinos around the room,"" William joked. ""We'll cover it in lots of bushes and things like that, make him grow up as if he's in the bush."" In the meantime, William said the possibility of his son carrying on the royal family's legacy in Africa isn't an immediate concern. ""At the moment, the only legacy I want to pass on to him is to sleep more and maybe not have to change his nappy so many times,"" he laughed. And like any new mother or father, the future monarch said he was surprised and amazed by parenthood so far. ""The last few weeks for me have been a very different emotional experience, something I never thought I would feel myself.  And I find, again it's only been a short period, but a lot of things affect me differently now.""","Prince William gives first official interview after birth of son to CNN's Max Foster .

"President Barack Obama's national security adviser said Friday that her full-throated praise of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl was appropriate given the former Taliban prisoner's willingness to go to war for his country -- despite questions about whether or not he deserted his Army colleagues. Susan Rice, who on Sunday said Bergdahl served the United States with ""honor and distinction,"" told CNN in an interview that she was speaking about the fact the Idaho native enlisted and went to Afghanistan in the service of his country. ""I realize there has been lots of discussion and controversy around this,"" Rice said. ""But what I was referring to was the fact that this was a young man who volunteered to serve his country in uniform at a time of war. That, in and of itself, is a very honorable thing."" The Obama administration has come under fire for the decision to trade five Taliban prisoners previously held at Guantanamo Bay for Bergdahl, who was held for nearly five years. Some soldiers who served with Bergdahl have claimed he deserted his post in Afghanistan. An Army-led investigation, which was conducted in the months after Bergdahl disappeared in 2009, found he left the outpost deliberately and on his own free will, according to a military official who was briefed on the report. Rice on Syria aid . There was no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted, because that would require knowing his intent -- something Army officials couldn't do without talking to the soldier. The military said it is investigating the matter further. Rice said Friday that it was essential for the military to hear Bergdahl's side of the story before coming to conclusions about what prompted his capture by the Taliban. The six soldiers at center of Bergdahl debate . ""This is a young man whose circumstances we are still going to learn about,"" she said. ""He is, as all Americans, innocent until proven guilty. He's now being tried in the court of public opinion after having gone through enormously traumatic five years of captivity."" If the military finds reason to believe Bergdahl deserted his Army comrades, consequences will be delivered, Rice said. ""But in the meantime, let's remember this is a young man who volunteered to serve his country. He was taken as a prisoner of war. He suffered in captivity,"" she continued. ""He's now trying to begin the process of recovery. Let's let that happen. And then let's know the facts including his side of the story, and then we can make a judgment."" Rice's comments last weekend weren't the first time she prompted criticism over an appearance on one of Washington's Sunday talk shows. In September 2012, she appeared on several programs following the attack on the American diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya -- and asserted the incident was prompted by a spontaneous protest against an anti-Muslim video made in the United States. The administration later acknowledged the attack was a terrorist assault on the U.S. compound. The ""Susan Rice talking points"" have become a political flashpoint, spurring congressional investigations, administration explanations, and -- potentially -- a major headache for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she runs for president in 2016. Rice has said she was simply providing the best information the administration had at the time -- and on Friday, she contended that just because the information she provided that day turned out to be inaccurate doesn't mean she's willfully misleading Americans. ""I'm upfront with the American people and I always do my best on behalf of my country and I do my best to tell the facts as I know them,"" she said. In the case of Benghazi, Rice said she ""provided the best information that the U.S. government had at the time. ""Parts of it turned out to be wrong,"" she said. ""I regret that the information I was provided was wrong, that I delivered to the American people. That doesn't make me a liar. That makes me a public servant trying to say what we knew at the time.""","CNN conducts interview with National Security Adviser Susan Rice .

"Conservatives are expressing shock and outrage that the Obama administration knew that many people in the individual insurance market would not be able to keep their plans once the Affordable Care Act took effect.  Such shock is not surprising; overblown outrage is the stock and trade of conservative politics these days. But here's what conservatives won't tell you, lest it undermine their theatrics:  Many insurance plans are shutting down because they don't meet the higher bar of quality benefits required under Obamacare, and of those people who lose access to their plans, many will pay less and all will have better and more comprehensive options. Also, with a few exceptions, no one is really noting that this point isn't quite news. In 2010, the fact that certain insurance plans would not be grandfathered into Obamacare because of their inadequate coverage was widely covered by the press.  It was a given, after all that, if standards for health insurance were going to be raised in America -- a good thing -- then some plans that don't meet the bar would no longer be available.  One could blame this on the Affordable Care Act, or alternatively, one could blame this on insurance companies for providing such substandard care in the first place. Here's what this boils down to: . Will some people lose their current insurance?  Yes. Will these same folks lose health insurance coverage?  No. They will all have access to better plans and in many cases pay less because of expanded options and tax credits. This whole kerfuffle ignores that insurance plans were changing all the time and premiums were skyrocketing pre-Obamacare.  Suddenly, a whole range of bad behavior on the part of insurance companies is blamed on the Affordable Care Act.  It's just like employers trying to shaft their workers by cutting hours and benefits and blaming it on the Affordable Care Act, even though employer mandate provisions don't take effect for another year. Trying to blame Obamacare for every problem in the private insurance market is paradoxical: The whole reason for passing the Affordable Care Act was to fix what's broken with private insurance . If we as a nation object to the inherent and deeper flaws within the private health insurance system in America, then we should embrace a single-payer system.  But instead, because conservatives were so wed to propping up the private insurance market, we got Obamacare.  It's disingenuous to turn around and point fingers at Obamacare for faults that have always been -- and will always be -- pervasive in private health insurance. The Affordable Care Act prevents some of the worst abuses of the private insurance market and makes coverage overall more inclusive and affordable.  It doesn't fundamentally alter the private market equation -- and incentives to cut corners and care. I know Republicans love their manufactured outrage, as much as they loved it back in September 2010, when Republican Sen. Mike Enzi cited the same 40% to 67% numbers for those expected to lose plans that NBC now reports as ""new news."" But the fact remains that about 80% of Americans get their health insurance either from their employers or from a program like Medicare, and that won't change at all under the Affordable Care Act. Millions more are  uninsured and will be thrilled to have access to affordable insurance at subsidized rates. This saves us all money, because the cost of their emergency room care isn't offloaded onto the rest of us in rising premiums.  What we're focused on now is the small sliver of Americans who, like myself, get insurance through the individual market.   Some of us will see our current plans disappear, but all of us will see our plans upgraded -- with many becoming more affordable. When it comes to President Obama and his policies, conservatives have a steady supply of manufactured shock.  But improving the quality and affordability of health insurance for all Americans and providing real facts along the way, that's an important accomplishment.","Sally Kohn: Conservatives feign shock that White House knew some plans would be canceled .
Kohn: It's because they don't meet Obamacare's higher bar of quality benefits .
If you lose your plan, she says, you'll have access to better and often cheaper plans .

"It can be exhausting nursing a child through a nasty bout with the flu, so imagine how 22-year-old Fatu Kekula felt nursing her entire family through Ebola. Her father. Her mother. Her sister. Her cousin. Fatu took care of them all, single-handedly feeding them, cleaning them and giving them medications. And she did so with remarkable success. Three out of her four patients survived. That's a 25% death rate -- considerably better than the estimated Ebola death rate of 70%. Fatu stayed healthy, which is noteworthy considering that more than 300 health care workers have become infected with Ebola, and she didn't even have personal protection equipment -- those white space suits and goggles used in Ebola treatment units. Instead Fatu, who's in her final year of nursing school, invented her own equipment. International aid workers heard about Fatu's ""trash bag method"" and are now teaching it to other West Africans who can't get into hospitals and don't have protective gear of their own. Every day, several times a day for about two weeks, Fatu put trash bags over her socks and tied them in a knot over her calves. Then she put on a pair of rubber boots and then another set of trash bags over the boots. She wrapped her hair in a pair of stockings and over that a trash bag. Next she donned a raincoat and four pairs of gloves on each hand, followed by a mask. It was an arduous and time-consuming process, but Fatu was religious about it, never cutting corners. UNICEF Spokeswoman Sarah Crowe said Fatu is amazing. ""Essentially this is a tale of how communities are doing things for themselves,""  Crowe said. ""Our approach is to listen and work with communities and help them do the best they can with what they have."" Two doctors for 85,000 people . She emphasized, of course, that it would be better for patients to be in real hospitals with doctors and nurses in protective gear -- it's just that those things aren't available to many West Africans. No one knows that better than Fatu. Her Ebola nightmare started Juy 27, when her father, Moses, had a spike in blood pressure. She took him to a hospital in their home city of Kakata. A bed was free because a patient had just passed away. What no one realized at the time was that the patient had died of Ebola. One woman walked in, and the Ebola nightmare began . Moses, 52, developed a fever, vomiting and diarrhea. Then the hospital closed down because nurses started dying of Ebola. Fatu took her father to Monrovia, the capital city, about a 90-minute drive via difficult roads. Three hospitals turned him away because they were full. She took him back to another hospital in Kakata. They said he had typhoid fever and did little for him, so Fatu took him home, where he infected three other family members: Fatu's mother, Victoria, 57; Fatu's sister, Vivian, 28, and their 14-year-old cousin who was living with them, Alfred Winnie. Guilty of Ebola until proven otherwise . While operating her one-woman Ebola hospital for two weeks, Fatu consulted with their family doctor, who would talk to her on the phone, but wouldn't come to the house. She gave them medicines she obtained from the local clinic and fluids through intravenous lines that she started. At times, her patients' blood pressure plummeted so low she feared they would die. ""I cried many times,"" she said. ""I said 'God, you want to tell me I'm going to lose my entire family?' "" But her father, mother, and sister rallied and were well on their way to recovery when space became available at JFK Medical Center on August 17.  Alfred never recovered, though, and passed away at the hospital the next day. ""I'm very, very proud,"" her father said.  ""She saved my life through the almighty God."" Now he's working to find a scholarship for Fatu so she can finish her final year of nursing school. He has no doubt his daughter will go on to save many more people during her life. ""I'm sure she'll be a great giant of Liberia,"" he said. Ebola patients left to lay on the ground .","Fatu Kekula, 22, nursed four family members infected with Ebola .

"(CNN) -- Seventy-two bodies discovered at a ranch in northeast Mexico belonged to migrants who were making their way toward the United States, Mexican officials said Wednesday. The preliminary investigation indicates the victims were illegal immigrants from Honduras, El Salvador, Brazil and Ecuador, said Alejandro Poire, spokesman for national security strategy. The motive for the killings was under investigation, though officials pointed out that Mexico's drug cartels have expanded their activities to include extortion and kidnapping of immigrants. ""Mexican institutions have hit the operational structures of these criminals and their income, and because of that, they turn to extortion and kidnapping of migrants, as well as recruiting them to force them to become part of their group of hit men,"" Poire said. The bodies of the 58 men and 14 women were found above ground in a structure on the ranch, which is about 14 miles (22 kilometers) from the town of San Fernando, near the border with Texas. The Mexican navy, which was called in to investigate the case, said it is one of the largest discoveries of bodies in Mexico's 4-year-old war on organized crime. Members of the Mexican navy were tipped off to the site after a man with a gunshot wound approached a military roadblock. The man said he had been injured by a criminal gang, according to a statement released by the navy. Mexico's attorney general's office identified the man as an Ecuadorean immigrant with a bullet wound to the neck. ""The navy went to the area where the man came from and encountered gunfights. A naval officer was killed and three of the delinquents were killed,"" said an officer who answered the telephone at the navy's communication department. The officer, who was not authorized to speak on the record, declined to give his name. After the gunbattle, authorities said, they found a stash of weapons, including 21 rifles, camouflage uniforms, bulletproof vests and four trucks. One of the vehicles had been disguised to look like a truck from the Ministry of National Defense, officials said. ""This discovery once again demonstrates the extreme danger and violence that Central Americans face on their treacherous journey north, as well as Mexican authorities' abject failure to protect them,"" Amnesty International said. ""Mexico must immediately investigate this massacre, bring the perpetrators to justice and establish the identities of those killed so that their families can be informed."" Wednesday's gruesome discovery came about a month after authorities in the neighboring state of Nuevo Leon discovered 51 bodies in nine mass graves. In that instance, investigators found charred remains, incinerated bone fragments and stains of fire on the ground where bodies were presumably burned in steel drums, the state-run Notimex news agency said. The bodies were mostly males between age 20 and 50, Notimex said. Many of them had tattoos. Similar mass graves have been discovered in the Mexican states of Guerrero and Quintana Roo since late May. Authorities have linked them to Mexico's ongoing drug war. Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas, which border Texas, have seen a marked increase in drug violence this year due to an intensifying rivalry between the Gulf cartel and the Zetas gang, which was formerly the cartel's armed branch. Last week, authorities found the bound and blindfolded body of Edelmiro Cavazos Leal, the mayor of a city in Nuevo Leon. He had been abducted two days earlier. His body was found on the outskirts of the city of Santiago, where Cavazos was mayor. There were signs of torture. News reports indicate that officials believe the Zetas ordered Cavazos killed. Five police officers and a transit worker were arrested last week in connection with the slaying. More than 28,000 people have died in drug-related incidents since President Felipe Calderon intensified the government's fight against drug cartels and organized crime after taking office in December 2006. About 90 percent of the fatalities have been among cartel members and other criminals, Calderon has said. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","NEW: The victims were illegal immigrants heading toward the United States, officials say .

"President Barack Obama has struggled with sagging approval ratings over the last year, but the commander-in-chief's numbers may have dropped further among active-duty troops. Just 15% of active-duty servicemembers gave Obama a thumbs up in the annual Military Times survey and more than half -- 55% -- say they disapprove of Obama's job as commander-in-chief. The President has struggled to gain the approval of troops throughout his time in office, but these numbers reflect a new low for Obama, who finished his first year in office with a 35% approval figure and only 4 in 10 disapproving, according  to the Military Times survey. The Military Times survey is not scientific and relies on a voluntary response from the publication's readers. President Obama's approval rating in the general population is much higher, though still well below 50 percent. In the most recent CNN / ORC poll, he got the approval of 44% of Americans. The Military Times survey also finds a lower approval rating than other polls of Americans connected with the military. A Washington Post / Kaiser Family Foundation poll of veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan found approval of the President was lower than the general population, but much higher than 15 percent. 32% of veteran respondents in that April survey said they approved of the job President Obama was doing. For these reasons, the Military Times survey may be more useful to show to show trends. It has been asking the same questions of its readers for ten years. Troop morale has slumped during the Obama administration, falling to 56% this year from 91% who were satisfied with their quality of life in 2009. More than half of American troops believe they are underpaid today. But the publication's readers are more supportive of the social changes the President has enacted in the military. Support among active-duty troops for allowing gay men and women to serve openly in the military has grown to 60% three years after ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" was reversed. About 41% of servicemembers said some combat roles should be off-limits for women. Obama's unpopularity among Military Times readers comes with sinking support for and trust in both major political parties. Nearly half of the active duty servicemembers surveyed said they believe both the Republican and Democratic parties have become less supportive of military issues. Only about 1 in 10 said the two parties ""have the armed forces' best interests at heart,"" according to the Military Times. The survey revealed another interesting trend in troops' political identities, revealing that fewer identify as Republicans and more are calling themselves libertarians or independents today. But that hasn't stopped them from missing their previous commander-in-chief, President George W. Bush. About two-thirds of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans said Bush was a good commander in chief compared to 42% for Obama, according to a Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll in April.","Only 15% of active-duty troops approve of Obama's job as commander-in-chief, according to a Military Times survey .

"In the exceedingly tight contest to become Iowa's next senator, Saturday's closely watched debate between Bruce Braley and Joni Ernst had the candidates trying to make each other blue by talking green. When it comes to energy, Ernst, a Republican state senator, and Braley, a Democratic congressman, both have controversial positions to defend to voters. Ernst elaborated on her position to shutter the Environmental Protection Agency, a move that critics say will make Iowa more polluted. Braley, meanwhile, explained his flip-flopping on the Keystone Pipeline that has left some Iowans skeptical about his commitment to create jobs. The debate made it clear: Environmental regulation is the issue where the 2014 hopefuls really differ. The states know how to best protect their natural resources, Ernst said, saying that ""the EPA has overreached."" Braley accused his Republican opponent of not wanting to ensure the cleanliness of the country's air and water. Braley himself was put on the defensive when he was asked why he had switched his position from supporting the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline to opposing it. ""When the pipeline was first proposed and we were first asked to vote on it, a lot of promises were made about what was going to happen with the oil produced in that pipeline and the jobs it created,"" Braley said. ""But the more I looked into it and the more I talked to Iowans, there was no guarantee that the oil produced and sent through that pipeline was going to stay in the United States and benefit U.S. consumers. And there was no guarantee that a lot of jobs would be create for Iowans."" The pipeline, which has yet to receive federal approval, would not run through Iowa, although the Republican Patty of Iowa strongly supports the measure as a part of their platform. At the center of the energy debate, the candidates swapped jabs about another kind of green: special interest dollars. Braley accused Ernst of favoring the interests of the oil industry over those of the alternate energy because she is backed by oil money. Ernst said the EPA overreached when the federal agency sent workers to Iowa to manage the water supply of agriculture producers, and accused Braley of supporting the agency because he is backed by wealthy environmentalists. The two candidates displayed a smaller gap in positions when it came to foreign policy. Both expressed concern over vetting and arming Syrian rebels to fight ISIS there. Ernst and Braley's parties differ greatly on immigration, but in this Senate race, the difference was a matter of degrees. The Republican said she is opposed to amnesty for undocumented immigrants already in the country but would not vote to repeal an Obama administration program that grants relief to some youths who were brought illegally into the country as children. Braley went a step further, saying that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, as the program is known, is working well for Iowans. ""I've talked to young people in Iowa who are using it ... and I've seen what it's done to give them hope and opportunities to get a job and make a better future for themselves and their families,"" he said. For much of the election, Braley has tried to shake his white collar image, after he made comments suggesting that Sen. Chuck Grassley was merely ""a farmer with no law degree."" Ernst capitalized on that gaffe last night. ""I am a young woman who grew up on a southwest Iowa farm drinking well water. My father is a farmer, and our farmers are some of the best conservationists out there. "" But Braley bit back. ""That's why my ancestors came from Ireland during the potato family, settled across the river in Cole Valley to start a better life for themselves. Than they moved to Iowa to start a farm. My great-great-grandfather died breaking that prairie."" On debate night, a new Des Moines Register poll showed the candidates in a dead heat. Ernst now leads 47% to 46% over Braley, down from a 6-point lead in their last poll.","Republican Joni Ernst defends her position to eliminate the EPA for overreach .

"Washington  (CNN)Jeb Bush revealed his strategy for dealing with the polarizing foreign policy legacy of his brother: Make a quick declaration of independence then pivot to a searing attack on the failings abroad of President Barack Obama. ""I love my father and my brother. I admire their service to the nation and the difficult decisions they had to make,"" Bush said Wednesday in Chicago during the first major foreign policy speech of his prospective Republican presidential campaign. ""But I am my own man."" The appearance offered Bush a chance to show how he will balance a desire not to dismiss George W. Bush's presidency while insulating himself from Democratic attempts to paint him as a clone of the man who led the nation into a bloody, prolonged era of foreign wars. Bush did concede that the previous Bush administration made ""a mistake"" by not providing security for Iraqis in the wake of the U.S. invasion in 2003. But he also argued that his brother's surge strategy forged political stability in Iraq that Obama squandered in his eagerness to get American troops home. It's too early to tell whether Bush's appearance answered the key question facing his campaign: Can a third man with the name ""Bush"" win the presidency in a nation exhausted by war and suspicious of dynasties? But his message seemed clearly tailored towards the activist base of the Republican Party, which likes its foreign policy hawkish, and has significant doubts about Bush on issues including immigration reform and education which could hamper his chances of winning the primary race. Democrats quickly tried to stamp out any progress Bush had made with the wider electorate which he would ask to entrust him with U.S. national security if he becomes the GOP nominee. ""Today, Jeb Bush made his first foray into explaining and attempting to recast his foreign policy,"" said DNC spokeswoman Holly Shulman. ""But despite Jeb Bush's claim that he will be his 'own man', there is little evidence that Jeb Bush's foreign policy agenda is much different than his brother's."" She added: ""Embracing decisions that made the world more dangerous, and then trying to shift the blame -- that's the Jeb Bush Doctrine."" Bush is not the first presidential candidate forced to differentiate himself from a powerful predecessor in a desire to strike out on his own. Vice President Al Gore famously declared he was his ""own man"" as he tried to shuffle out of the shadow of Bill Clinton's impeachment shame in 2000. Obama jabbed Hillary Clinton in 2008 over her famous husband's intervention in the campaign, saying he could not sometimes tell who he was running against. She responded: ""I'm here. He's not."" Bush is a more cerebral, cautious character than his brother and his speech lacked the bristling rhetoric of George W. Bush which Democrats often decried as a symptom of cowboy diplomacy. But the hawkish global vision he laid out sat squarely in the muscular foreign policy that has dominated the Republican Party since his brother went on the offensive following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Bush made a case that Obama was being misled by Iran on nuclear talks, said the president had been too soft on Russia, sided with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the row over his address to Congress and condemned the administration's opening to Cuba. He said Obama's failure to do a deal to keep U.S. troops in Iraq created a ""void"" exploited by extremists. ""This administration talks, but the words fade,"" Bush said. ""They draw red lines, and then erase them. With grandiosity they announce resets and then disengage. Hashtag campaigns replace actual diplomacy and engagement."" Bush offered few surprises. This was exactly the kind of speech a prospective GOP presidential candidate would be expected to make 21 months before a general election. Bush made a case that Obama's politics had tipped the world into chaos, played to the GOP's base and avoided unveiling new policies that could get ripped to shreds in the long months on the campaign trail. Despite the inclusion on list of foreign policy advisors released by his camp of Republican gurus James Baker and George Schultz, Bush had little in common with the subtle internationalism of his father George H.W. Bush. ""The great irony of the Obama presidency is this, someone who came to office, promising greater engagement with the world has left America less influential in the world,"" Bush said. ""Everywhere you look, you see the world slipping out of control,"" Bush said, blaming Obama for the rise of ISIS, the breakdown of Iraq and Syria, Iranian dominance of the Middle East and and Russia's belligerence. ""Under this administration, we are inconsistent and indecisive. We have lost the trust and confidence of our friends. We definitely no longer inspire fear in our enemies,"" Bush said, in a speech delivered at such a breakneck pace that he at one point confused Iran and Iraq. This was clearly an act of political positioning rather than an attempt to chart a meaningful foreign policy strategy. ""We policy wonks like wonkish speeches and politicians like political speeches,"" said Justin Logan, head of the foreign policy program at the Cato Institute. ""There was nothing very surprising about the speech. I think there would be nothing very surprising about President Jeb Bush's foreign policy. This was a do no harm speech."" Bush did little to deviate from Republican foreign policy orthodoxy. He said a strong economy was crucial to U.S. national security, advocated increased military spending, rebuilt alliances with NATO members and in Asia and an effort to reengage with traditional U.S. friends in the Middle East like Egypt. While he repeatedly criticized Obama, he did not say if he would use military force against Iran if nuclear diplomacy failed or make a decisive intervention into the debate about whether to deploy ground troops to Syria to help fight ISIS. He did however advocate arming Ukraine. It was the kind of speech that every single Republican running for president is likely to give during the campaign -- with the possible exception of the more isolationist Rand Paul. The goal seemed to be to show Bush could be trusted with national security but was not extreme. And it likely did little to scare off other possible Republican candidates -- especially someone like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who is positioning himself as a foreign policy expert. ""Nobody is going to be running for eight more years of Obama foreign and defense policy,"" said James Jay Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""Everybody is going to sound like they are not a neo-con and not an isolationist. This would check the box of what you would expect a responsible speech to sound like."" Bush argued that he had come by his foreign policy views in a grounding in global affairs that started when he lived overseas with his wife Columba in Venezuela. As governor, he said, he led multiple trade missions to Latin America and had visited Israeli five times. He said he had ""forced"" himself to visit Asia four times a year to experience the region's explosive growth -- and complained that people he met said Obama's Asia ""pivot"" policy was all talk and no action. He ended his speech with a message to Republican isolationists and Obama's foreign policy backers. ""America does not have the luxury of withdrawing from the world,"" Bush said.  ""Our security, and our prosperity, and our values demand that we remain engaged and involved in -- often distant places,"" he said. ""We have no reason to apologize for our leadership, or our interest in serving the cause of global security, global peace, and human freedom. Nothing and no one can replace strong American leadership."" CNN's Ashley Killough contributed to this report .","Bush balances brother's Iraq war legacy and his political hopes .

"(CNN) -- Women seeking an abortion in Texas will have to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure, under a law that takes effect September 1. The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. It was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, ""in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,"" the law states. There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law. Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability. ""Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,"" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed. Critics say the new law is unnecessary. ""What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,"" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas. Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period, and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions, she said. ""It's going to make it more difficult for women to get an abortion,"" Gutierrez said, calling it the most stringent sonogram law in the country. In addition, Gutierrez said, there is the fear that the added requirements on doctors could make them averse to providing the procedure for fear of legal action that could lead to revocation of their licenses. But Elizabeth Graham, director of Texas Right to Life, said, ""As long as they are following the law, they have nothing to worry about."" The law, she says, ""will strengthen informed consent and bring abortion closer to standards that are set for other surgical procedures."" If anything, requiring a sonogram is simply like requiring an X-ray before a surgical procedure, Graham said. ""The sonogram law is an enormous step forward toward protecting women's health in Texas,"" she said.","A Texas law effective Sept. 1 requires women seeking abortionsto get sonograms .
A doctor must explain the results of the sonogram .
Exceptions are allowed, including in cases of sexual assault ."
"(CNN) -- Senate Democratic leaders announced they've reached ""broad agreement"" on a package of provisions to replace the public option, a move that means their version of the health care bill is morphing into something that looks less and less like the House version. Senate leaders aren't releasing details of the revised plan, so it's unclear how much of the bill will be changed. Two Democratic sources said the deal includes a proposal to replace the public option by creating a not-for-profit private insurance option overseen by the federal Office of Personnel Management, much like the current health plan for federal workers, and another allowing people 55 or older to buy into Medicare coverage that currently is available to those 65 or older. The compromise appears to be a far cry from the government-backed public health care option offered in the House bill. The Senate's original health care bill included a public option similar to that of the House version. The biggest difference was that under the Senate plan, states could opt out of the public option. Should the Senate pass a bill with the public option alternative, merging it with the House bill would not be easy, but there's still a long ways to go before lawmakers get to that point. The Senate last month voted to begin debate on its version of the bill. Since then, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has been making changes and trying to secure the 60 votes needed to end debate on the bill. A simple majority -- 51 votes -- is needed for final passage. After the House and Senate bills are merged, each chamber must give the consensus version final approval before it goes to President Obama's desk to be signed into law. The public option divide is just one of several differences that need to be ironed out. Depending on what's in the new Senate package, a lot of the details could change, but here are some of the other issues expected to be sticking points: . Abortion . In the run-up to the House vote, Republicans and conservative Democrats joined forces to pass an amendment that tightens restrictions on federal funding for abortion services. The amendment would toughen funding limits in the health care bill, preventing subsidies not only from directly paying for abortions, but also from paying for any insurance plan that covers abortions. The prohibition excludes cases of rape, incest, or if the mother's life is in danger. The Senate rejected a similar amendment but will allow the Health and Human Services secretary to decide whether abortion coverage would be granted under a government-sponsored plan and will permit coverage in private plans. But this is now subject to change, depending on the details of the Senate public option alternative. Medicaid expansion . Medicaid, the government-run health care plan for the poor, would be expanded significantly under both proposals. The House bill would extend coverage to individuals earning up to 150 percent of the poverty line, or roughly $33,000 for a family of four. The original Senate plan ensured coverage to those earning up to 133 percent of the poverty level, or just over $29,000 for a family of four. This is subject to change, depending on the final Senate plan. Individual mandate . Under both plans, individuals would be required to purchase coverage, but the House bill includes more stringent penalties for most of those who fail to comply. The Senate plan would require individuals to buy health insurance, with a fine for noncompliance of $95 in the first year that would escalate to $750 by 2016. Parents would be responsible for providing coverage for children up to age 18. The House bill would impose a fine of up to 2.5 percent of an individual's income. Both versions include a hardship exemption for poorer Americans. Employer mandate . Employers face a much stricter mandate under the House legislation, which would require companies with a payroll of more than $500,000 to provide insurance or pay a penalty of up to 8 percent of their payroll. The Senate bill would require companies with more than 50 employees to pay a fee of up to $750 per worker if their employees rely on government subsidies to purchase coverage. The House and Senate have agreed to create health insurance exchanges designed to make it easier for small businesses, the self-employed and the unemployed to pool resources and purchase less-expensive coverage. The House plan creates a national health insurance exchange; the Senate plan calls for state health insurance exchanges in all 50 states. Illegal immigration . Both bills state that subsidies cannot go to undocumented workers, but differ in how they enforce that. They also differ on how easy it should be for illegal immigrants to buy health insurance with their own money. In general, the House bill gives illegal immigrants more opportunity to buy health insurance and would verify their identity in fewer areas. Proponents say it's more humane and cost-effective. Opponents say it's simply more liberal and would encourage more people to illegally enter the U.S. The Senate bill, in contrast, would mandate verification in more areas and would sharply limit the ability of undocumented workers to buy their own health insurance. Both bills ban any government funds or subsidies from going to help illegal immigrants get health care. Democrats say they will tightly enforce that; opponents sharply question the enforcement in the bill. Cost . The House bill is more expansive -- and hence expensive -- than the Senate bill. The House bill, projected to guarantee coverage for 96 percent of Americans, will cost more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The original Senate bill was estimated to cover 94 percent of Americans and came with an $848 billion price tag, according to the CBO. The CBO has not yet released an estimate of the new Senate plan. Financing . One of the biggest divides between House and Senate Democrats is over how to pay for the plans. The House package is financed through a combination of a tax surcharge on wealthy Americans and new spending constraints in Medicare and Medicaid. Specifically, individuals with annual incomes over $500,000 -- as well as families earning more than $1 million -- would face a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge. The Senate measure also trims entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The bill also includes a range of tax increases and new fees. The Medicare payroll tax on individuals earning $200,000 a year and couples earning $250,000 a year would increase by a half-percentage point, from the current 1.45 percent to 1.95 percent. In addition, insurers providing costly health coverage -- known as ""Cadillac"" plans -- would face a 40 percent tax on premiums of greater than $8,500 for individuals and $23,000 for families. The Senate bill also includes a 5 percent tax on the cost of elective cosmetic surgery, as well as new fees for insurers and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The revenue from all the taxes and fees is projected to exceed $200 billion. CNN's Tom Cohen, Lisa Desjardins, Evan Glass, Kristi Keck and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","Senate still has to vote to end debate, pass bill, then merge it with House version .

"Eric Shinseki resigned Friday as the head of the Department of Veterans Affairs, leaving behind the daunting task of repairing a broken health care system that has left thousands of veterans at risk as they wait for medical care. Shinseki's resignation concluded a firestorm of criticism and growing calls for him to step down following revelations of sometimes deadly delays for veterans waiting for care at VA hospitals, allegations exposed by CNN in a series of exclusive reports. Details of the delays were first exposed by CNN last November in an investigation into two VA hospitals in the Southeast. Since then, CNN's reporting has expanded to include numerous other VA hospitals, culminating with details about secret waiting lists at the Phoenix VA that may have played a role in the deaths of 40 veterans. President Barack Obama went before reporters at the White House minutes after meeting with Shinseki, saying the retired Army general told him ""the VA needs new leadership"" to address widespread issues that were chronicled in new reports this week. Obama said Shinseki ""does not want to be a distraction."" ""That was Ric's judgment on behalf of his fellow veterans, and I agree. We don't have time for distractions. We need to fix the problem,"" Obama said. Calls for Shinseki's resignation snowballed in recent days from across the political spectrum -- Republicans and Democrats, as well as veterans' advocacy groups -- because of the misconduct. In a farewell message to VA employees, Shinseki didn't address the scandal specifically but did say he resigned with veterans' interests in mind. ""My personal and professional commitment and my loyalty to veterans, their families and our survivors was the driving force behind that decision,"" he said. ""That loyalty has never wavered, and it will never wane."" Shinseki says 'situation can be fixed,' but not by him . Earlier Friday, Shinseki announced steps to address the VA shortcomings, including removing senior leaders in the Phoenix VA medical system, eliminating performance awards for VA leaders in 2014 and wait times as a metric for evaluations and accelerating care to veterans. He also apologized to veterans and Congress, but declared: ""This situation can be fixed."" But Shinseki won't be part of the solution. He went to the White House to present Obama with findings from his internal audit of what was happening in the VA system, including that many audited facilities had ""questionable scheduling practices"" that signaled a ""systemic lack of integrity."" Read the VA audit report . The President acknowledged that scheduling issues didn't rise to the attention of Shinseki, whom he praised as a man who ""has served his country with honor for nearly 50 years."" At the same time, Obama said that he and Shinseki agreed that a shift in leadership was necessary. For now, Sloan Gibson -- a Shinseki deputy -- will head the VA until a new secretary is named and confirmed. ""Part of that is going to be technology. Part of that is management,"" the President said. ""But as Ric Shinseki himself indicated, there is a need for a change in culture within the VHA, and perhaps the VHA as a whole -- or the VA as a whole that makes sure that bad news gets surfaced quickly so that things can be fixed."" Read Obama's statement . Breaking open the scandal . Secret VA waits lists alleged in Phoenix . Problems in the VA system date back decades, but CNN's reporting of long waits at VA hospitals brought the issue into national focus at the end of 2013. An April report by CNN in which sources said 40 veterans died at a Phoenix VA facility that used secret waiting lists to cover up the problem prompted angry calls for action. The VA has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care. CNN also obtained an e-mail written by an employee at a Wyoming VA clinic that said staff was instructed to ""game the system"" to make the clinic appear more efficient. A preliminary inspector general's report made public Wednesday described a ""systemic"" practice of manipulating appointments and wait lists at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Phoenix. The VA's troubled history . According to the report, at least 1,700 military veterans waiting to see a doctor were never scheduled for an appointment or were placed on a waiting list at the Phoenix VA, raising the question of just how many more may have been ""forgotten or lost"" in the system. In a recent USA Today opinion piece, Shinseki ordered VA officials to contact each of these veterans ""in order to bring the care they need and deserve."" The latest report by the VA inspector general's office and Shinseki's auditors indicated a link between employee bonuses and covering up patient wait times. There also have been calls for a criminal investigation into fraudulent record-keeping to cover up delays at VA hospitals. Obama said Friday that would be up to the Justice Department, which has been collecting information but has not launched any investigation. Shortly before he resigned, Shinseki told a veterans group that he was shocked by the inspector general's report, especially the prevalence of wait lists for veterans needing medical care. ""That breach of integrity is irresponsible, it is indefensible and unacceptable to me,"" he told the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans just before heading over to his final meeting with Obama. ""I said when this situation began weeks to months ago and I thought the problem was limited and isolated because I believed that. I no longer believe that. It is systemic,"" he said. At the same time, the VA chief of more than five years said that others had misled him. ""I was too trusting of some, and I accepted as accurate reports that I now know to have been misleading with regard to patient wait times,"" he said. ""I can't explain the lack of integrity among some of the leaders of our health care facilities. This is something I rarely encountered during 38 years in uniform and so I will not defend it because it's indefensible, but I can take responsibility for it and I do."" Shinseki couldn't weather firestorm . Whistleblower: VA was 'way too focused on ... good numbers' As the accusations mounted -- including the latest one in which Reps. Mike Doyle and Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania claimed 700 veterans had been placed on a primary care waiting list for doctor appointments at the Pittsburgh VA center, with some waiting since 2012 -- so too did the pressure on Shinseki. Senators calling for Shinseki resignation . Politicians largely applauded Shinseki's resignation on Friday, even as they said that the VA needed to do more than put new people in his place to resolve its shortcomings. ""The denial of care to our veterans is a national disgrace, and it's fitting that the person who oversees the Department of Veterans Affairs has accepted responsibility for this growing scandal and resigned,"" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said in a statement. Meanwhile, a VA whistleblower who told CNN about the problems at the Phoenix facility said Friday he was saddened by Shinseki's resignation under such circumstances. ""The VA administrators got way too focused on having good numbers and they forgot the most important mandate, the reason we all work at the VA -- to take care of veterans, to save their lives and give them good medical care,"" Dr. Sam Foote said. ""The next secretary's biggest challenge will be to get that refocused and make sure the number one job is taking care of veterans - not worrying about their bureaucratic careers,"" Foote added. VA pledges faster appointments .","Obama accepts VA secretary's resignation, says Shinseki doesn't want to be a distraction .

"(CNN) -- In the midst of the contentious debate over the Common Core State Standards, many critics have lost perspective on its purpose. Why did so many governors, educators and policymakers across both parties join together to create the standards in the first place? A brief look at Common Core's history would help explain its significance and counter some of the criticisms. In 1983, then Secretary of Education Terrel Bell commissioned the seminal report, ""A Nation at Risk,"" which highlighted American students' falling SAT scores and awakened the nation to its educational malaise. Among many of the report's recommendations, which eventually became a platform for modern education reforms, were calls for ""more rigorous and measurable standards."" American students were victims of low expectations and inconsistent learning goals. But despite the report's warnings and billions of dollars more spent on education, not much has changed. Thanks to benchmarked national and international exams, like the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) or Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), we know that American students continue to fall short. (There's one sliver of good news: For a number of reasons there have been dramatic improvements in some individual states like Massachusetts.) These exams highlighted how the performance of American students differed widely between states and districts. Some states had high internationally competitive standards; others were far too low. In fact, some states were dumbing down standards and exams in order to hide the poor performance of their students. For example, New York State rated 87% of its fourth graders proficient in math, according to its own state testing in 2009. That would be astounding -- if true. But NAEP results calculated that only 40% of the state's fourth graders were proficient or better in math. Educational performance in many districts and states resembled Lake Wobegon -- the fictional place in Garrison Keillor's ""A Prairie Home Companion"" where ""all the women are strong, all the men are good looking, and all the children are above average."" But reality is different. Local control has always been an essential right of education in America, but there was a growing problem: When different states with different standards and different tests proliferated, we ended up with unreliable measures of how our children are really doing. A wide and disparate variety of education standards promotes chaos and deception. Realizing this, in 2009, a collaborative involving the National Governors Association and Council of Chief State School Officers began to discuss the need for common standards and accountability. The end goal is that an ""A"" in math in New Jersey should be equivalent to an ""A"" in math in Louisiana, or in California, and so on. So began the coordinated effort from governors, educators and legislators to compose benchmarked standards that would be the same across state lines. The product became the Common Core State Standards. Its genesis was local and its purpose was to lift education performance through state, not federal, collaboration. This was the original intent of the Common Core. It is a worthy and necessary idea. Unfortunately, outside forces have interfered with or distorted the idea, obscuring its real merits. Federal intrusions such as the Race to the Top grants have not been helpful. Common Core isn't without its problems, but some of have been exaggerated and some have been made up out of thin air. We can't lose sight of the original intent. Should Common Core fail, the movement -- decades in the making -- toward rigorous, common standards would be dealt a serious blow. While various questions about Common Core and its implementation persist, such as how to handle data privacy or concerns that some of the standards may not be rigorous enough, individual states have the right and ability to craft their own supplemental solutions. For example, this year Ohio passed HB 487 to protect the confidentiality of student data and Florida altered its Common Core standards to include more advanced calculus standards. Some of the criticisms leveled against Common Core stem from mistakes made in local implementations -- not from a uniform federal mandate. It is ironic that the very thing which many of Common Core's critics value the most -- local control -- has often resulted in curricula, subject matter, readings, and exercises in local classrooms that are objectionable, substandard, or politically tendentious. If Common Core fails, education reform will regress and American students' flat or falling test results in learning will continue. It must be noted that many of Common Core's critics still lack a persuasive alternative or any alternative at all.","William Bennett: Critics of Common Core have lost perspective of its purpose .
Bennett: The problem is how to address American students' flat or falling test scores .
He says lack of common standards means inconsistent and unreliable learning results .

"The New York City medical examiner's office Friday confirmed what demonstrators had been saying for weeks: A police officer's choke hold on a man being arrested for selling loose cigarettes killed him. Eric Garner, 43, died July 17 after being confronted by police on Staten Island for allegedly selling cigarettes illegally. During the encounter, Garner raised both hands in the air and told the officers not to touch him. Seconds later, a video shows an officer behind him grab the 350-pound man in a choke hold and pull him to the sidewalk, rolling him onto his stomach. ""I can't breathe! I can't breathe!"" Garner said repeatedly, his cries muffled into the pavement. The cause of Garner's death was ""compression of neck (choke hold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police,"" said Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office. The death was ruled a homicide. Acute and chronic bronchial asthma, obesity and hypertensive cardiovascular disease were listed as contributing conditions in a controversial death that sparked anti-police demonstrations and calls for a federal investigation. On Saturday, Garner's widow, Esaw, appeared at a Harlem rally with the victim's mother, Gwen Carr, and the Rev. Al Sharpton. ""First of all, I want to thank the God above for giving us justice for my husband so that we can move forward,"" she said. ""I met with the prosecutors and I feel like I did the right thing by doing that and I just want them to do the right thing and get me justice for my husband."" Sharpton is planning a march across the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which connects Brooklyn and Staten Island, for August 23. Douglas Auer, a spokesman for the Richmond County district attorney's office, said the investigation into the death was continuing. ""We await the issuance of the official death certificate and the autopsy report,"" he said in a statement. The U.S. Justice Department has said it is monitoring the investigation. If local prosecutors decline to file criminal charges, the federal justice department could conduct an investigation into whether the victim's civil rights were violated. ""The District Attorney will be examining the case to determine if the use of the choke hold was necessary to subdue and arrest Garner, or was an excessive use of force resulting in death,"" CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said. A former deputy chief of homicide for the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, Callan said a choke hold does not violate state law but is prohibited by NYPD guidelines on excessive force. Mayor Bill de Blasio Friday expressed his ""deepest sympathies"" to Garner's family. ""My administration will continue to work with all involved authorities, including the Richmond County District Attorney, to ensure a fair and justified outcome,"" he said in a statement. ""We all have a responsibility to work together to heal the wounds from decades of mistrust and create a culture where the police department and the communities they protect respect each other ... I've said that we would make change, and we will. As mayor, I remain absolutely committed to ensuring that the proper reforms are enacted to ensure that this won't happen again. The video of the incident showed the Staten Island man lying on the ground motionless after he was taken down by a group of officers. An asthmatic, Garner was later declared dead at a nearby hospital. Police said he suffered a heart attack and died on the way to the hospital. ""This is a terrible tragedy that occurred. ... A terrible tragedy that no family should have to experience,"" de Blasio said after the death, calling the video of the incident ""very troubling."" Garner, a grandfather with six children, had a lengthy criminal history, including more than 30 arrests, and had been previously arrested for selling untaxed cigarettes in May, according to police. But demonstrators in New York called the police response during his arrest excessive and criminal. On July 19, Garner's friends and family rallied with Sharpton in Harlem, demanding a full investigation into Garner's death. Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who is seen on the video choking Garner, was put on modified assignment and stripped of his badge and gun amid the investigation, the New York Police Department said.  A second police officer was placed on desk duty. The choke hold tactic is prohibited by the NYPD. Two EMTs and two paramedics also were suspended without pay, according to Erika Hellstrom, vice president of development at Richmond University Medical Center. In a statement, Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Patrick J. Lynch called Pantaleo's reassignment ""a completely unwarranted, kneejerk reaction for political reasons."" He said the move ""effectively pre-judges this case and denies the officer the very benefit of a doubt that has long been part of the social contract that allows police officers to face the risks of this difficult and complex job."" On Friday, the police union expressed ""sympathies and prayers"" for the Garner family and said it stood ""firmly in support of all police officers""  put in difficult circumstances. ""Police officers don't start their days expecting or wanting something like this to occur in the performance of their duties,"" PBA president Patrick Lynch said in a statement. ""The ME's report indicates that Mr. Garner was a man with serious health problems so there will have to be a complete and thorough analysis of all the factors that played a part in this tragedy. We believe, however, that if he had not resisted the lawful order of the police officers placing him under arrest, this tragedy would not have occurred."" Police Commissioner William Bratton ordered an extensive review of the NYPD's training procedures after Garner's death. After a two-hour meeting with NYPD Training Commissioner Ben Tucker last week, Bratton ordered a ""top to bottom review of all the training that this department provides to its personnel, specifically focusing on force, how do we train our officers for a takedown, how do we train them to use the various levels of force that they're authorized to use."" ""I would anticipate that coming out of this effort that there will be a retraining of every member of the New York City Police Department in the weeks, months and potential years ahead,"" Bratton said.

"A Pennsylvania doctor is accused of running a ""house of horrors"" in which he performed abortions past the 24-week limit allowed by law -- even allegedly as late as eight months into pregnancy. He used scissors, authorities say, to sever the spinal cords of newborns who emerged from their mothers still alive. Now Dr. Kermit Gosnell, 72, is about to stand trial. He has pleaded not guilty. If he's convicted, prosecutors want him put to death. ""A doctor who cuts into the necks severing the spinal cords of living, breathing babies, who would survive with proper medical attention, is committing murder under the law,"" Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said. A grand jury investigation determined that health and licensing officials had received repeated reports about Gosnell's practices for two decades, but had taken no action, Williams said. Gosnell's attorney has cautioned against a ""rush to judgment."" ""Dr. Gosnell should enjoy the same presumption of innocence anyone in this country, you or me, should get if we were charged with a crime,"" William J. Brennan said in 2011. Jury selection was set to begin Monday. The charges . Gosnell faces eight counts of murder: for the deaths of seven babies, and in the case of a 41-year-old woman who died of an anesthetic overdose during a second-trimester abortion. The babies were born alive in the sixth, seventh and eighth months of pregnancy, but their spinal cords were severed with scissors, Williams said. 2011: Philadelphia doctor accused of murdering patient, newborns . ""It was a house of horrors beyond any type of definition or explanation I can humbly try to give,"" Williams told CNN in January 2011, shortly after Gosnell was charged. ""And it's very sad for the women that were there, that were subjected to such horrific and barbaric -- I would say medical treatment, but it wasn't medical treatment."" Several other people who worked in the west Philadelphia medical office have already pleaded guilty to related charges. A judge involved in the case said in 2011 that one of those employees was expected to testify against Gosnell. The practice . The practice, called the Women's Medical Society, served mostly low-income minority women for years. Gosnell is not a board-certified obstetrician or gynecologist, Williams said. Originally, he said, the clinic used another doctor as a consultant so it could receive a license to perform abortions in 1979. ""The doctor gained a reputation. People far and wide knew that he performed abortions at any time,"" Williams said. 2011: Philadelphia abortion clinic worker pleads guilty . In a 2010 interview with the Philadelphia Daily News, Gosnell said he was ""a positive force in the community."" The reporter who interviewed him, David Gambacorta, told CNN that Gosnell believed he was helping an under-served population in his West Philadelphia neighborhood. The scene . When authorities searched Gosnell's office, they found bags and bottles holding aborted fetuses scattered throughout the building. Jars containing the severed feet of babies lined a shelf. Furniture and equipment was blood-stained, dusty and broken. ""My grasp of the English language doesn't really allow me to fully describe how horrific this clinic was -- rotting bodies, fetal remains, the smell of urine throughout, blood-stained,"" Williams said. Williams described one of the alleged infant deaths. ""The baby had been born and was on a cold steel table and murdered by using -- there's no medical basis for snipping or taking scissors and putting them into the neck and cutting, severing the spinal cord. It's just homicide. It's just murder,"" Williams told CNN. According to Philly.Com, a joint website of the Philadelphia Daily News and the Philadelphia Inquirer, Gosnell was back in court last Thursday, to mull a possible plea bargain. It's unclear what the outcome of the meeting was, because of a gag order imposed on attorneys and other people involved in the case. 2011: Survivor of accused abortionist Kermit Gosnell tells her story .","Dr. Kermit Gosnell is charged with murdering seven babies and a pregnant woman .

"Americans are increasingly concerned that ISIS represents a direct terror threat, fearful that ISIS agents are living in the United States, according to a new CNN/ORC International poll. Most now support military action against the terrorist group. Seven in 10 Americans believe ISIS has the resources to launch an attack against the United States, just days before President Barack Obama plans to address the nation on the subject. The poll released Monday shows that Americans favor: . -- Additional airstrikes against ISIS (76% favor, 23% oppose) -- Military aid to forces fighting ISIS (62% favor, 37% oppose) -- Providing humanitarian aid to people fleeing ISIS (83% favor, 16% oppose) U.S. targets ISIS fighters near Iraq's second-largest dam . But a majority of Americans, 61%-38%, oppose placing U.S. soldiers on the ground in Iraq and Syria to combat the terrorist group. Even as Americans support military action against ISIS, they still want Obama to seek authority from Congress before taking any action. More than 7 in 10 Americans think Obama should ask Congress for the ability to strike ISIS militarily. And 8 in 10 Americans support Congress approving military force against ISIS. Obama: U.S. to go on offense against ISIS . Obama, who described ISIS as a ""serious threat"" in an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" is scheduled to speak to the nation Wednesday to outline his strategy to address the terrorist organization. He will meet with congressional leaders on Tuesday to discuss his plan. While the CNN poll indicates Americans think ISIS has the ability to attack the United States, Obama said in the NBC interview there has been no ""immediate intelligence"" that signifies the terrorist group is a threat. And while Obama did not offer specific details of his plan to strike ISIS, he did take the idea of putting U.S. groups on the ground in Iraq and Syria off the table. Obama's upcoming speech comes as two Americans were murdered and grisly images and stories of the terrorist group needlessly killing enemies have emerged from Iraq and Syria. So far, Americans are not happy with how Obama has addressed the ISIS situation. The CNN/ORC poll shows that only 30% of Americans think that he has a clear plan for dealing with ISIS. Overall, the President's approval rating is 43%, while 55% disapprove how he is handling his role as commander in chief. House intel chief: Obama needs an ISIS endgame . On the eve of the 13th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the threat of ISIS rivals that of al Qaeda in 2003. The CNN/ORC Polls shows that 45% of Americans see that ISIS is a ""very serious threat to the U.S,"" while 49% thought the same of al Qaeda 11 years ago. The threat of terrorism has grown exponentially in recent years, according to those being polled. In September 2010, only 3% of Americans named terrorism as the most important problem facing the country. It has now increased to 14% and ranks right behind the economy, 30%, as the most important problem facing the nation. ""Americans are significantly less reluctant to use military force than they were a year ago, and the number who say that terrorism is the country's most important problem has quadrupled, making it second only to the economy on the list of top problems in the public's mind,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said.

"The coffee mug is covered in a prescription label, with the RX#: VRY-CAF-N8D. ""Drink one mug by mouth, repeat until awake and alert,"" the instructions read. The mug is one of several Urban Outfitters prescription-themed products that have come under fire recently from safety advocates who say the items promote the misuse and abuse of painkillers. ""In the 20,000 products that comprise our assortment, there are styles that represent humor, satire, and hyperbole,"" Urban Outfitters said in a statement. ""In this extensive range of product we recognize that from time to time there may be individual items that are misinterpreted by people who are not our customer.  As a result of this misinterpretation we are electing to discontinue these few styles from our current product offering."" The move comes after several groups sent letters to the retailer asking it to stop selling the prescription line. On Monday, Marsha Ford, president of the American Association of Poison Control Centers, wrote to Urban Outfitter CEO Richard Hayne on behalf of her organization. ""Local poison centers experts know firsthand the dangers of medicine abuse and misuse. In 2011, they managed 209,909 cases of exposures to painkillers. Of those, 21,752 were teens ages 13 to 19,"" the letter said. ""Products such as these minimize the dangers of medicine abuse and misuse and are very dangerous."" Ford's letter followed an earlier one sent by the attorneys general of 22 states and Guam that also urged Urban Outfitters to cease sales of glasses, coasters, mugs, drink holders and other prescription-related products. ""There is a national health crisis related to the abuse and diversion of prescription drugs,"" the chief legal officers wrote. ""We are actively engaged in a campaign of environmental change to educate the public that abuse of prescription drugs is not safe simply because the medication originated from a doctor. By putting these highly recognizable labels on your products, you are undermining our efforts."" One person dies from a drug overdose every 19 minutes in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; about half of those deaths involve prescription painkillers. In fact, accidental overdoses have surpassed car crashes as a leading cause of American accidental deaths. One doctor described it to Dr. Sanjay Gupta as the biggest man-made epidemic in the United States. ""Distribution of morphine, the main ingredient in popular painkillers, increased 600% from 1997-2007,"" Gupta later wrote in an op-ed for CNN. ""In the United States, we now prescribe enough pain pills to give every man, woman and child one every four hours, around the clock, for three weeks.""","Urban Outfitters will discontinue prescription-themed products due to ""misinterpretation""

"A New York Times report on the September 11, 2012, attack that killed four Americans -- including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens -- in Benghazi, Libya, calls into question much of what Republicans accusing the Obama administration of a cover-up have said about the incident. The three main points of contention have been whether the attack was planned, whether it was sparked by an anti-Muslim video, and whether al Qaeda was involved. However, the Times says, the administration's version, focusing on outrage over the inflammatory video, and first delivered by then-ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice on Sunday morning talk shows five days later, isn't exactly right, either. ""The reality in Benghazi was different, and murkier, than either of those story lines suggests. Benghazi was not infiltrated by Al Qaeda, but nonetheless contained grave local threats to American interests. The attack does not appear to have been meticulously planned, but neither was it spontaneous or without warning signs,"" according to David D. Kirkpatrick's article in the Times. It's a conclusion that CNN has drawn in its previous reporting. The attack at the Benghazi diplomatic compound has become a political flashpoint in a long-running battle between the White House and Republicans, who accuse the Obama administration of not bolstering security before the attack, of botching the response to it and of misleading the public for political gain less than two months before the November election. The GOP suggests the administration removed specific terror references and stuck to the explanation advanced by Rice -- later proved untrue -- that the attack was the result of spontaneous demonstrations over the U.S.-produced film ""Innocence of Muslims,"" which contained scenes some Muslims considered blasphemous. The White House and its allies in Congress have said any confusion and conflicting information in the early hours and days after the assault stemmed from the ""fog of war,"" not any deliberate effort to mislead the public. The White House had no comment when CNN requested a response to the Times article. After reading it, Obama's former national security spokesman Tommy Vietor unleashed a series of tweets, including these, condemning Republicans who've spent more than a year lambasting and investigating the Beghazi incident: . -- ""If Rs spent 1/50th as much time as @ddknyt learning what really happened in #Benhazi, we could have avoided months of disgusting demagoguery."" -- ""Republicans inflated the role of al Qaeda in #Bengazi to attack Obama's CT record. They were wrong, and handed our enemy a propaganda win."" -- ""Credit to @ddknyt but also disconcerting that his #Benghazi article offered more insight into what happened than all Congressional hearings."" The Times' article, which includes interviews with several Libyan militia leaders who helped bring down Col. Moammar Gadhafi's dictatorship in 2012, says no evidence supports speculation about al Qaeda's involvement in the Benghazi attack. To the contrary, the Times reports that the diverse and fractured opposition militias, many of whom were at least somewhat friendly toward U.S. interests, most likely contributed to the attack. That dovetails with the findings of the State Department investigative panel report on Benghazi. ""The Benghazi attacks also took place in a context in which the global terrorism threat as most often represented by al Qaeda (AQ) is fragmenting and increasingly devolving to local affiliates and other actors who share many of AQ's aims, including violent anti-Americanism, without necessarily being organized or operated under direct AQ command and control,"" the report said. The Times report zeroes in on militia leader Abu Khattala as well as the like-minded Islamist militia Ansar al Sharia. In a recent interview with CNN's Arwa Damon, Khattala acknowledged being at the Benghazi mission after the attack but denied any involvement. Damon spent two hours interviewing Khattala at a coffee shop at a well-known hotel in Benghazi. He allowed Damon to use an audio recorder to tape the conversation, but refused to appear on camera. Khattala's narrative of the events that night was sometimes unclear and, at times, seemed to be contradictory, Damon said. He admitted to being at the compound the night of the attack, but denied any involvement in the violence. Asked about allegations he may have masterminded the attack, Khattala and two of the men he brought with him to the interview ""burst out laughing,"" Damon said. Khattala told CNN that he had not been questioned by either Libyan authorities or the FBI. The militia leader was one of those whom U.S. prosecutors charged in the attacks, as CNN first reported. Ansar al Sharia is more a label than an organization, one that's been adopted by conservative Salafist groups across the Arab world. The name means, simply, ""Partisans of Islamic Law."" In Benghazi, Ansar al Sharia was one of many groups that filled the vacuum of authority following the overthrow of Gadhafi. The group's central belief is that all authority is derived from the Prophet Mohammed, that democracy is un-Islamic and that other branches of Islam, such as the Sufi, are heretical. There do not appear to be organizational links between Ansar al Sharia and al Qaeda, but there is solidarity. Among the group's Benghazi membership is Mohammed al-Zahawi, who fought to overthrow Gadhafi and praised al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri in a BBC interview. He said al Qaeda's statements ""help galvanize the Muslim nation, maintain its dignity and pride."" A different Ansar al Sharia is affiliated with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen, and budding franchises are said to exist in Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt.","New York Times article says competing storylines about 2012 Benghazi attack likely are both wrong .

"Shezanne Cassim, the American jailed in the United Arab Emirates after posting a video parody, was sentenced Monday to one year in prison and a fine of 10,000 UAE dirhams (approximately $2,700). The young American living in the UAE has been imprisoned since April, his family says, for posting what was intended to be a funny video on the Internet. He was accused of defaming the UAE's image abroad, according to The National, the country's main English-language newspaper. The video in question is a 19-minute short that pokes fun at a clique of Dubai teens who are influenced by hip-hop culture. In the 1990s, the label ""Satwa G"" was coined for a group of suburban teens who were known to talk tougher than they really were. The video depicts a look at a ""combat school"" in the suburb of Satwa, where these ""gangsters"" are trained. The training includes how to throw sandals at targets, using clothing accessories as whips, and how to call on the phone for backup. Tight-lipped about charges . Cassim's family says the 29-year-old has been charged with endangering national security. The charges were not read out in court. UAE officials would only say ""Mr. Cassim was charged under the UAE's penal code. Anyone charged with a crime under the laws of the UAE is entitled to the fair trial protections contained in the UAE's constitution."" Cassim, from Woodbury, Minnesota, moved to Dubai in 2006 after graduating from college to work for PricewaterhouseCoopers. He and some friends made and posted the video online in 2012. He was arrested in April. He was interrogated and arrested in Dubai before being transferred to a maximum security prison in Abu Dhabi. His family says it was five months before he was notified of the charges against him. 'It was just for fun' In an interview with CNN on December 5, Cassim's brother, Shervon, said Shezanne had made the video for fun. ""It was just for fun. It was -- he's a big fan of sketch comedies. He's a big fan of 'SNL,' 'Funny or Die,' all those shows, and he and his friends just wanted to make a funny sketch comedy in their spare time,"" Shervon Cassim said. ""There was no indication in local law that making a comedy video, making fun of teenagers in the suburbs, was a threat to the UAE's national security."" Family members said they had spoken to him when he was allowed a phone call out. ""He tries to put on a brave face,"" Shervon Cassim said. ""He said that he was doing fine, not to worry about him, but I could just sense that he's a little depressed -- my impression is that he's going just a little bit crazy in his cell.""","Newspaper says Cassim is accused of defaming the UAE's image abroad .

"Five university students who used the signature three-fingered salute from ""The Hunger Games"" in front of Thailand's Prime Minister were detained Wednesday and told they'll face a charge of breaking martial law, a lawyer said. The students were taken away after flashing the salute -- popularized by the film's central figure, Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) -- at a speech in northeastern Thailand by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to civil servants, according to Phavinee Chumsri, from the group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. At the time, the quintet in Khon Kaen province -- about 450 kilometers (280 miles) northeast of Bangkok -- was in a line wearing shirts bearing the words ""Don't want a military coup,"" Phavinee said. A Thai government spokesman did not respond to CNN calls for comment on the matter. But, according to Phavinee, the Khon Kaen University students were taken to a Thai army facility, Camp Sri Patcharin, where they refused to sign an agreement not to participate in political activities. They were released after about eight hours, the lawyer said, but have been asked to come back on the charge that they broke the martial law that's been in effect in Thailand since Prayuth -- then the army's chief -- announced in May the the country had been placed under military control. Since then, the junta imposed a series of measures purportedly aimed at restoring order and resolving the crisis, including media blackouts, curfews and bans on public assembly. Yet, the opposition hasn't gone away. Hollywood has played a role in part of this movement, thanks in part to protest leader Sombat Boonngamanong. On Twitter and elsewhere, Sombat has often used pop-culture references to spread his messages. One such reference that appears to have resonated comes from the films based on the book series by Suzanne Collins. Katniss, a teenage girl who competes in a spectacle of blood lust known as the Hunger Games, displays the three-finger gesture, which becomes a symbol of revolution against a tyrannical government. The third movie installment in the series, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"" is due to hit theaters in Thailand on Thursday. But one cinema in Bangkok canceled all showings of the movie after a pro-democracy student group bought tickets and planned to hold a meeting at the Lido Scala in the center of the city, according to Ratthapon Supasopon, of the League of Liberal Thammasart for Democracy (LLTD). He said the management informed them of the move and refunded their money.","Lawyer: 5 Thai students flash ""Hunger Games"" salute in front of Prime Minister .

"On Thursday, Dr. Kent Brantly thought he was going to die. It was the ninth day since the American missionary worker came down sick with Ebola in Liberia. His condition worsening by the minute, Brantly called his wife to say goodbye. Thankfully, the call was premature. Brantly is back on his feet -- literally -- after receiving a last-ditch, highly experimental drug. Another American missionary with Ebola got the same. Brantly's and Nancy Writebol's conditions significantly improved after receiving the medication, sources say. Brantly was able to walk into Emory University Hospital in Atlanta after being evacuated to the United States last week, and Writebol is expected to arrive in Atlanta on Tuesday. On July 22, Brantly woke up feeling feverish. Fearing the worst, Brantly immediately isolated himself. Writebol's symptoms started three days later. A rapid field blood test confirmed the infection in both of them after they had become ill with fever, vomiting and diarrhea. It's believed Brantly and Writebol, who worked with the aid organization Samaritan's Purse, contracted Ebola from another health care worker at their hospital in Liberia, although the official Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case investigation has yet to be released. The experimental drug, known as ZMapp, was developed by the biotech firm Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc., which is based in San Diego. The patients were told that the treatment had never been tried before in a human being but had shown promise in small experiments with monkeys. Questions about this new Ebola drug . According to company documents, four monkeys infected with Ebola survived after being given the therapy within 24 hours after infection. Two of four other monkeys that started therapy within 48 hours after infection also survived. One monkey that was not treated died within five days of exposure to the virus. Brantly and Writebol were aware of the risk of taking a new, little-understood treatment and gave informed consent, according to two sources familiar with the care of the missionary workers. In the monkeys, the experimental serum had been given within 48 hours of infection. Brantly didn't receive it until he'd been sick for nine days. The medicine is a three-mouse monoclonal antibody, meaning that mice were exposed to fragments of the Ebola virus and then the antibodies generated within the mice's blood were harvested to create the medicine. It works by preventing the virus from entering and infecting new cells. The Ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which refers to a group of viruses that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding. Early symptoms include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. They later progress to vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function -- and sometimes internal and external bleeding. The ZMapp vials, stored at subzero temperatures, reached the hospital in Liberia where Brantly and Writebol were being treated Thursday morning. Doctors were instructed to allow the serum to thaw naturally without any additional heat. It was expected that it would be eight to 10 hours before the medicine could be given, according to a source familiar with the process. Brantly asked that Writebol be given the first dose because he was younger and he thought he had a better chance of fighting it, and she agreed. However, as the first vial was still thawing, Brantly's condition took a sudden turn for the worse. Brantly began to deteriorate and developed labored breathing. He told his doctors he thought he was dying, according to a source with firsthand knowledge of the situation. Knowing his dose was still frozen, Brantly asked if he could have Writebol's now-thawed medication. It was brought to his room and administered through an IV. Within an hour of receiving the medication, Brantly's condition dramatically improved. He began breathing easier; the rash over his trunk faded away. One of his doctors described the events as ""miraculous."" By the next morning, Brantly was able to take a shower on his own before getting on a specially designed Gulfstream air ambulance jet to be evacuated to the United States. Writebol also received a vial of the medication. Her response was not as remarkable, according to sources familiar with the treatment. However, doctors on Sunday administered Writebol a second dose of the medication, which resulted in significant improvement. She was stable enough to be evacuated back to the United States. The process by which the medication was made available to Brantly and Writebol is highly unusual. World Health Organization spokesman Gregory Hartl cautioned that health authorities ""cannot start using untested drugs in the middle of an outbreak, for various reasons."" Doctors Without Borders similarly weighed in on the side of caution. ""It is important to keep in mind that a large-scale provision of treatments and vaccines that are in very early stages of development has a series of scientific and ethical implications,"" the organization said in a statement. ""As doctors, trying an untested drug on patients is a very difficult choice since our first priority is to do no harm, and we would not be sure that the experimental treatment would do more harm than good."" ZMapp has not been approved for human use and has not even gone through the clinical trial process, which is standard to prove the safety and efficacy of a medication. It may have been given under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's ""compassionate use"" regulation, which allows access to investigational drugs outside clinical trials. Getting approval for compassionate use is often long and laborious, but in the case of Brantly and Writebol, they received the medication within seven to 10 days of their exposure to the Ebola virus. On July 30, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, an arm of the military responsible for any chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high-yield explosive threats, allotted additional funding to MAPP Biopharmaceutical due to ""promising results."" American Ebola patient 'seems to be improving'","Untested drugs can't be used in the midst of an outbreak, spokesman says .

"A federal judge ruled Monday that Chicago's ban on virtually all sales and transfers of firearms is unconstitutional. ""The stark reality facing the City each year is thousands of shooting victims and hundreds of murders committed with a gun. But on the other side of this case is another feature of government: certain fundamental rights are protected by the Constitution, put outside government's reach, including the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense under the Second Amendment,""  wrote U.S. District Judge Edmond Chang. ""Chicago's ordinance goes too far in outright banning legal buyers and legal dealers from engaging in lawful acquisitions and lawful sales of firearms,"" he continued. Chang explicitly did not rule out other types of regulation, short of a complete ban, in order to ""minimize the access of criminals to firearms and to track the ownership of firearms. ""But the flat ban on legitimate sales and transfers does not fit closely with those goals,"" Chang wrote. 'It's got to stop,' grandmother says after 3-year-old injured in Chicago shooting . The judge stayed his ruling to give the city time to file an appeal. The FBI's latest annual crime report showed Chicago had 500 homicides in 2012, up from 431 in 2011 and more than any other American city. Still, Chicago does not have the highest homicide rate in the United States. That unwanted distinction belongs to Flint, Michigan, with one homicide for every 1,613 residents, according to the FBI data. Detroit is close behind, with one killing for every 1,832 residents.

"It's too soon to say what steps the United States will take against ISIS in Syria, President Barack Obama said Thursday. ""I don't want to put the cart before the horse,"" Obama told reporters during a White House news briefing. ""We don't have a strategy yet."" Obama said he's asked America's top defense officials to prepare ""a range of options"" about what the United States could do to go after ISIS in Syria, which he described as ""a safe haven"" for the Sunni extremist group that calls itself the Islamic State. The President's remarks follow days of speculation about whether the United States had a plan to go after ISIS in Syria. ""We need to make sure that we've got clear plans, that we're developing them. At that point, I will consult with Congress and make sure that their voices are heard,"" Obama said. ""But there's no point in me asking for action on the part of Congress before I know exactly what it is that is going to be required for us to get the job done."" Torture allegations . The Washington Post on Thursday reported that journalist James Foley, who was decapitated by ISIS, was tortured during his captivity. Specifically, Foley was waterboarded, the newspaper reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the treatment of abducted Westerners. Waterboarding is a controversial technique that was used by the U.S. in its war of terrorism. Waterboarding is a interrogation technique where water is poured over a cloth covering the subject's face, creating the sensation of drowning. A senior U.S. official declined to confirm to CNN if the waterboarding claims are true, saying that such details would not be discussed out of sensitivity to the families of those still being held. ""As we have said, hostages held by ISIL are at risk every day they are in ISIL's custody, given what we know about the nature of this brutal group,"" the official said, using an alternate acronym for ISIS. 'We're not going to do that alone' But the President made clear any plan to go after ISIS in Syria would take time and require a regional strategy. ""We're not going to do that alone,"" he said. The President said he was sending Secretary of State John Kerry to the region to work on building a coalition needed to face the threat of ISIS militants. ""Clearly, ISIL has come to represent the very worst elements in the region that we have to deal with collectively, and that's going to require us to stabilize Syria in some fashion,"" Obama said. ""And stabilizing Syria means that we've to got get moderate Sunnis who are able to govern and offer ... a real alternative."" But that may prove to be problematic. Syria's ally, Russia, has repeatedly blocked attempts by the U.N. Security Council that call on President Bashar al-Assad to step down as part of an effort to end the civil war that has wracked the country for three years. Among the options Obama said he requested from the U.S. military were plans to make sure ISIS does not overrun Iraq. U.S. airstrikes in Iraq are working, he said. ""The terrorists of (ISIS) are losing arms and equipment,"" Obama said, and Iraqi and Kurdish forces are making inroads. But ""the idea that the United States or any outside power would perpetually defeat ISIS ... is unrealistic,"" Obama said, insisting that a strong, trusted Iraqi government is critical to ousting the Islamist terror group permanently. What can the U.S. do against ISIS, and could it work? ISIS claims mass execution in Syria . ISIS said Thursday that it has executed at least 250 Syrian soldiers at an air base in the northeastern city of Raqqa. The group said on one of its official websites that it killed the soldiers Wednesday. It also claimed to have killed 600 government soldiers in the fight for the Tabqa air base since August 19. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, meanwhile, reported that 200 Syrian soldiers and 346 ISIS fighters died in the fight for the air base, which was considered the military's last holdout in eastern Syria. Hundreds more were wounded, the London-based activist group said. ISIS claims that a video it posted online Thursday shows Syrian soldiers being paraded through the desert in their underwear. Another video posted by Syrian activists purportedly shows bodies lined up on the ground. Later, ISIS posted a video that it says shows captured Kurdish soldiers, known as Peshmerga, wearing orange clothing similar to that worn by by American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff in other videos posted by the militant group. Three masked men appear to decapitate one of the orange-clad soldiers in front of a mosque in Mosul. In the video, titled ""A message with blood to the leaders of the America Kurdish alliance,"" ISIS demands that the Kurdish government withdraw its forces from areas where it is battling the group. CNN could not independently confirm the claims or the authenticity of the videos. A 13-year-old witness to ISIS' beheadings, crucifixion in Syria . Fighting flares near Mosul Dam . The videos come amid reports of fresh fighting between ISIS and Kurdish forces near Iraq's Mosul Dam and the burning of oil wells near the strategic town of Zummar. The Peshmerga are battling the militants near the town, important because of its location to the main thoroughfare that connects Mosul to the Syrian border, as well as near the Mosul Dam and the strategic Ain Zala oilfield, which ISIS forces seized from the Kurds this month, said Faud Hussein, chief of staff for Kurdish regional President Masoud Barzani. Torching the three oil wells that make up the Ain Zala oilfield is an apparent effort by ISIS fighters to try to interrupt a Peshmerga advance on ISIS positions, Hussein said. The extent of the damage to the oil fields wasn't immediately known. The fighting comes nearly two weeks after thousands of Peshmerga and Iraqi commandos ousted ISIS forces for control of the dam, a crucial facility that provides electricity for millions of people in Iraq. Kurdish officials have credited U.S. airstrikes against ISIS with helping Peshmerga forces push back against the extremists, whose breathtaking gains and brutal tactics captured the attention of world leaders.

"Jose Antonio Vargas trumpeted that he was an undocumented immigrant for years. But authorities never apprehended him. Until now. On Tuesday, U.S. Border Patrol agents detained the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist-turned-activist in McAllen, Texas, after he told them he was in the country illegally, officials said. He was released on his own recognizance with a notice to appear before an immigration judge, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. Vargas was detained Tuesday morning at the McAllen airport while trying to pass through security en route to Los Angeles, said Ryan Eller, campaign director for Define American, a group Vargas founded in 2011. Vargas became an outspoken advocate pushing for an overhaul of the nation's immigration laws in 2011, when he revealed he was undocumented in a column for The New York Times Magazine. Recently, he detailed his life story in ""Documented,"" a film about the U.S. immigration debate that he wrote and directed. CNN aired it on June 29. Vargas said in a statement released by a spokesperson Tuesday evening that he had been released. ""I want to thank everyone who stands by me and the undocumented immigrants of south Texas and across the country,"" he said. ""Our daily lives are filled with fear in simple acts such as getting on an airplane to go home to our family."" Even with his high profile and frequent speaking events about his immigration status, Vargas hadn't found himself in the cross hairs of authorities until his trip this month to the border region to support unaccompanied minors coming from Central America . ""Mr. Vargas has not previously been arrested by (Immigrations and Customs Enforcement) nor has the agency ever issued a detainer on him or encountered him,"" the Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday. ""ICE is focused on smart, effective immigration enforcement that prioritizes the agency's resources to promote border security and to identify and remove criminal individuals who pose a threat to public safety and national security."" Tania Chavez, an undocumented youth leader who met with Vargas recently and has accompanied him around the McAllen area, told CNN that he was detained because he did not have proper documentation. It was a possibility Vargas feared after he arrived in the region. ""Because I don't have any ID besides my Filipino passport, it's going to be hard for me to actually get out of here at some point when I decide to get out of here in the next couple of days,"" he told CNN on Sunday. Early Tuesday, Vargas tweeted that he was about to go through security at McAllen-Miller International Airport. Since outing himself as an undocumented immigrant three years ago, he says he has traveled extensively, visiting 40 states. ""I don't know what's going to happen,"" he tweeted, directing his followers to the Twitter handles for Define American and the University of Texas-Pan American's Minority Affairs Council. Within minutes, the latter retweeted a photo of Vargas in handcuffs with the caption: ""Here's a photo of (Vargas) in handcuffs, because the Border Patrol has nothing more pressing to do apparently."" In Politico last week, Vargas wrote a piece headlined ""Trapped on the Border."" The story documents how he went to McAllen to visit a shelter where undocumented immigrant children were being held. He also wanted to share his ""story of coming to the United States as an unaccompanied minor from the Philippines,"" he wrote for Politico. Once in McAllen, he spoke to Chavez, who expressed concern that he might not make it through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection checkpoints about 45 minutes outside McAllen. ""Even if you tell them you're a U.S. citizen, they will ask you follow-up questions if they don't believe you,"" Chavez told him, according to the Politico piece. ""In the last 24 hours I realize that, for an undocumented immigrant like me, getting out of a border town in Texas -- by plane or by land -- won't be easy. It might, in fact, be impossible,"" he wrote Friday. Vargas, Define American and other groups traveled to McAllen to ""stand in solidarity with and humanize the stories of the children and families fleeing the most dangerous regions of Central America,"" Eller told reporters Tuesday. Vargas told CNN on Sunday that he traveled to McAllen to document the plight of refugees. Before he went to bed Monday, Vargas told Eller, ""Our America is better than this. We're more humane. We're more compassionate. And we're fighting for a better America, a country we love but has yet to recognize us,"" the Define American campaign director recalled Tuesday. At 12, Vargas came to the United States from the Philippines in 1993 with a man he'd never met but whom his aunt and a family friend introduced as his uncle, wrote in his 2011 New York Times Magazine column. Once in the States, he lived with his grandfather, a security guard, and grandmother, a food server. Both were naturalized American citizens who had been supporting Vargas and his mother since Vargas was 3. He'd later learn that his grandfather had paid $4,500 for this purported uncle -- who was a coyote, or people smuggler -- to bring Vargas to the United States under a fake passport and name. ""After I arrived in Mountain View, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area, I entered sixth grade and quickly grew to love my new home, family and culture. I discovered a passion for language, though it was hard to learn the difference between formal English and American slang,"" Vargas wrote for the magazine. One of his earliest memories, he wrote, was a schoolmate asking him, ""What's up?"" He replied, ""The sky."" Vargas says he didn't know he was in the country illegally until he was 16, when he applied for a driver's license and was told his green card was bogus. He went home and asked his grandfather whether that was true, according to the magazine story. ""Lolo was a proud man, and I saw the shame on his face as he told me he purchased the card, along with other fake documents, for me. 'Don't show it to other people,' he warned,"" Vargas wrote. Vargas has written for numerous publications as a journalist, including The New Yorker. He interned for The Seattle Times and worked for The Huffington Post, the San Francisco Chronicle and the Philadelphia Daily News. In 2008, he was part of the Washington Post team that won the Pulitzer Prize for its breaking news coverage of the previous year's shooting rampage at Virginia Tech. Vargas got bylines on two of the nine stories the Pulitzer board cited. ""Over the past 14 years, I've graduated from high school and college and built a career as a journalist, interviewing some of the most famous people in the country,"" he wrote in his 2011 magazine piece. ""On the surface, I've created a good life. I've lived the American dream. But I am still an undocumented immigrant."" Vargas: Undocumented and hiding in plain sight .

"A week after a powerful 7.0 tremor ripped through Haiti in January 2010, time was running out for Ena Zizi. The 64-year-old woman was trapped, without food and water, eight meters under the rubble of Port-au-Prince's ruined cathedral. A  team of rescuers from South Africa worked against the clock to rescue her, with the stench of decomposing bodies in their nostrils. After two-and-a-half hours, the rescuers from the Gift of the Givers Foundation managed to pull Zizi out of the debris of the once-imposing building. The South African team, working alongside a Mexican group, made headlines around the world and became front-page news back home. Imtiaz Sooliman, who founded Gift of the Givers, says the rescue mission marked the first time rescuers from an African country pulled someone out of earthquake rubble alive in another part of the world. ""We achieved a world first for the African continent,"" he says. Sooliman added that the rescue is proof of his continent's ability to make a positive contribution to the rest of the world. ""Africa is always viewed as people receiving aid, here Africa went across another part of the world and saved somebody in another land, how much greater can it be?"" he says proudly. ""That was an achievement for Africa: This time, we are not asking, this time we are saying, 'We are going to give,' that is a step in the right direction,"" the South African doctor-turned-aid worker adds. But, it wasn't the first time Sooliman's organization made a big difference in disaster-hit areas outside Africa. Launched in 1992, Sooliman's Gift of the Givers has so far delivered aid to 32 countries -- from deploying the world's first containerized mobile hospital in war-torn Bosnia and delivering food and water in flood-hit Pakistan, to helping Zimbabwe tackle its cholera outbreak and saving lives in Haiti. It is now the largest disaster relief group of African origin. Sooliman's foundation has been providing life-saving aid for almost two decades now and he says it has been shattering stereotypes about Africa along the way. ""When I was in Pakistan in 2005 and some other countries were getting together for the earthquake, and when we came they got confused and they said, 'Who are you people?'"" recalls Sooliman. ""'I said we're from South Africa,' 'Oh, you're from Africa, did you come to ask something here?' I said 'No, I didn't come to ask something, I brought something,'"" he adds. More recently, Sooliman's group was among the first to respond to the devastating famine in Somalia. Gift of the Givers say they have flown 180 tons of emergency aid from South Africa to the east African country's capital, Mogadishu and delivered a further 2,000 tons by sea. Sooliman, a household name in South Africa, credits the media for encouraging his compatriots to give generously. ""South Africa sent a very strong statement: They said we are African and Somalia is African and we're going to respond to our brothers and sisters in Africa -- even to the point people told me that poor people in South Africa refuse to receive donations that they normally receive. ""They said 'Give these donations to the people of Somalia, they need it more than we need it.' It was an amazing spirit, in South Africa we call it Ubuntu: The spirit of sharing, of goodwill, of compassion,"" he says. Sooliman has personally traveled twice to famine-ravaged Somalia to deliver, not only food, but also medical expertise and equipment . In what is the group's biggest project ever, Gift of the Givers doctors have also treated thousands of people and performed surgical operations. In recognition of his humanitarian work, Sooliman has been presented with numerous accolades over for the years by several governments and organizations across the world, including the PMB civic commendation award in 1997 from Nelson Mandela. The celebrated philanthropist says he often invites the media to join him in his missions to make his group's operation transparent and to be accountable for what he is given by South Africans. ""I tell the media, 'Come -- no restriction, no telling you what to say, speak or write, you report what you see, what you observe and what you perceive,' and they've been traveling with us for many missions."" Sooliman says his aid agency, which has three warehouses in South Africa packed with supplies, would be able to feed tens of thousands of people if a disaster struck now.

"Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, the man allegedly behind the inflammatory film ""Innocence of Muslims,"" was ordered held without bail Thursday after being arrested in California and accused of violating his probation. ""He engaged in a likely pattern of deception both to his probation officers and the court,"" Judge Suzanne Segal said in issuing her ruling. The preliminary bail hearing began with Segal asking the defendant -- dressed in gray slacks and a white and yellow striped T-shirt, with handcuffs and chain around his waist -- what his true name was. ""Mark Basseley Yousseff,"" he replied. The judge then asked again, what is your name? ""Mark Basseley,"" he said this time, again without spelling the name out. He has used at least 17 false names, according to court documents, but is mostly referred to as Nakoula. An attorney for the man then argued for $10,000 bail. Attorney Steve Seiden said his client had always maintained contact, in person and by telephone, with probation officers who have been monitoring him since his 2010 bank fraud conviction. But the main reason Nakoula shouldn't be jailed, his lawyer argued, was for safety reasons, saying the anti-Islam film would make him a target of fellow inmates. ""It is a danger for him to remain in custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles because there are a large number of Muslims in there,"" Seiden said. ""We are extremely concerned about his safety."" Making no mention of aliases, the lawyer added that Nakoula had made no attempt to flee Southern California and never would. Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Dugdale told the judge that the man -- whom he referred to as Nakoula or Bassil -- had engaged in a ""pattern of deception"" and ""a person who cannot be trusted."" Dugdale pointed to a probation report citing eight allegations in which Nakoula had allegedly violated his probation. One of those was a requirement not to use aliases without permission from his probation officer, something the prosecutor said Nakoula did on at least three instances: during his fraud case, when he tried to get a passport in 2011 and during the making of the film. Dugdale said Nakoula had deceived the cast of the film as well as his probation officers. The prosecutor also noted that Nakoula was able to afford to make payments during the making of the film, saying it further raised concerns about the possibility of him fleeing the area while the legal case against him proceeds. ""He poses a flight risk and poses a danger to others,"" Dugdale said, alluding to the probation report's recommendation that Nakoula be sentenced to 24 months in prison. The prosecutor added that he had received assurances from the Metropolitan Detention Center that Nakoula would be placed in protective custody if he was ordered jailed, meaning he would not have contact with other inmates. The judge, who ordered a future identity hearing to determine the defendant's actual name, cited the many instances in which he misrepresented his name. She also noted his ""unstable"" residence and work history, referring to the film project, as also among the reasons for denying him bail. When asked if he understood the nature of the hearing, Nakoula answered, ""Yes."" The judge then waived his right to a preliminary hearing and left open a future date for a revocation hearing. Immediately following Thursday's hearing, Nakoula was escorted away by the U.S. Marshals Service in a three-car caravan and driven two blocks to the Metropolitan Detention Center. 'Innocence of Muslims' actress sues filmmaker, YouTube . Earlier this month, Nakoula met with a probation officer in the wake of a federal review of his five-year supervised probation in the 2010 case. Nakoula was cooperative at that voluntary interview, authorities said. He was bundled up in a coat, hat and white scarf when he was escorted from his house for that interview. He wasn't under arrest at that time. Having served one year in federal prison at Lompoc, California, officials couldn't determine this month whether Nakoula paid any of the court-ordered restitution of $794,700, according to probation department officials and court records. While on probation, Nakoula was prohibited from using aliases as well as accessing computers or any device that can access the Internet without approval from his probation officer. Iran blocks YouTube, Google over Mohammed video . He came to the world's attention after his movie, a trailer of which had been posted to YouTube, was highlighted this month by media in Egypt. Violent protests subsequently erupted in Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Israel and the Palestinian territories, with some of them targeting U.S. diplomatic missions. On Friday, a Chechen court ruled the film to be extremist and banned it in the Russian republic, according to information minister Murat Tagiyev. The film has potential to inflame sectarian hatred and may cause ""destabilization of the political situation in the region, most of whose population is Muslim,"" he said. As the protests raged, Nakoula remained out of public view and ensconced with his family in their home in Cerritos, California, southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Actor: Anti-Islam filmmaker 'was playing us along' When news of his movie first broke, the filmmaker identified himself as Sam Bacile and told The Wall Street Journal he was a 52-year-old Israeli-American real estate developer from California. He said Jewish donors had financed his film. But Israel's Foreign Ministry said there was no record of a Sam Bacile with Israeli citizenship. A production staff member who worked on the film in its initial stages told CNN that a different name was filed on the paperwork for the Screen Actors Guild: Abenob Nakoula Bassely. A public records search showed an Abanob B. Nakoula residing at the same address as Nakoula Basseley Nakoula. Another staffer who worked on the film said he knew the producer as Sam Bassil.

"The millennials are growing up, but they are not growing out of their liberalism. The generation born since 1981 is the age group most likely to vote Democratic. The eldest of them are in their 30s now, and they continue to be much more liberal than previous-age cohorts at the same point in their lives. A big new survey by the Pew Research Center seeks to understand why. Its report carries political warnings for conservatives -- and some larger warnings for us all. The warning for conservatives is: Millennial attachment to the Democratic Party is not a phase. Millennials are far less likely to be religiously affiliated than their elders. They are more likely to have children outside marriage (47% of their children are born outside marriage, compared with only 35% of Generation X children in 1996). They are poorer than their predecessor generations at the same point in their life cycles. Despite facing higher levels of unemployment and student loans, millennials stand out -- in Pew's phrase -- ""as the nation's most stubborn economic optimists."" A majority expect that they will earn enough money in the future to live the lives they want. Let's hope their dreams come true. But looking at the demographic and economic statistics, that's not the way to bet. What then? Here's a generation detached from religious institutions and only weakly attached to the country: Only 49% of millennials describe themselves as patriotic, compared with 64% of the next older cohort and 75% of baby boomers. Millennials are alienated. What will happen if they feel disappointed as well? One prediction about their future is already coming true: The millennial generation will be a generation characterized by high levels of inter-ethnic political conflict. Among the young as among the old, political preferences are cleaved by race and ethnicity. One obvious example: Non-white millennials approve of President Obama's job performance by a 2-1 ratio. White millennials disapprove by almost the same margin. By a margin of 52% to 39%, white millennials prefer a smaller government that offers fewer services to a bigger government that offers more. Non-white millennials say the opposite by a margin of 71% to 21%. These numbers show a racial gap about the same as among the older cohorts. However, since non-whites make up a bigger portion of the millennials than in older generations, their overwhelming preference for a more activist government will sway future elections even more than recent ones. Good news for liberals? Maybe. But maybe not. Since John F. Kennedy's clarion ""ask not,"" liberals have tried to call Americans to a politics of common purpose. The continuing sharp divide between the politics of the country's dwindling white former majority and its emerging non-white new majority may portend that common purpose will recede even further out of reach than ever. A quality of millennials that leaps out from the survey is their deep mistrust of other people. In response to the question, ""Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you can't be too careful in dealing with people,"" just 19% of millennials say most people can be trusted, compared with 31% of Generation Xers, 37% of the silent generation and 40% of boomers. Pew hypothesizes that this low level of trust is a consequence of the economic vulnerability of the milllennial generation: ""People who feel vulnerable or disadvantaged for whatever reason find it riskier to trust because they're less well-fortified to deal with the consequences of misplaced trust."" Yet there's another -- and more ominous -- explanation lurking in the numbers. Robert Putnam of ""Bowling Alone"" fame has collected data showing that social trust declines as a community becomes more ethnically diverse. ""The short run effect of being around people who are different from us is to make all of us uncertain -- to hunker down, to pull in, to trust everybody less. Like a turtle in the presence of some feared threat, we pull in."" In other words, in a more diverse society, it's not just those who feel vulnerable who trust less. In a more diverse society, everybody trusts less. The clarion call of common purpose begins to sound more like a warning alarm that your group is about to be used for the benefit of another. The accusation that the (non-white) ""takers"" are plundering the (white) ""makers"" has powered protest politics since 2009. If anything, that accusation looks likely to increase in its political effect in the years ahead. As America has become more ethnically diverse, political leaders have insisted ever more persistently that this diversity is a source of strength. Let's hope that proves to be true. America will need that strength in a future that, by the number, seems likely to be more mutually suspicious, more alienated, more unequal and less united by patriotism.","A Pew report says millennials are most likely to vote Democratic .

"The militant Islamist group Boko Haram has issued an ultimatum giving Christians living in northern Nigeria three days to leave the area amid a rising tide of violence there. A Boko Haram spokesman, Abul Qaqa, also said late Sunday that Boko Haram fighters are ready to confront soldiers sent to the area under a state of emergency declared in parts of four states by Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan on Saturday. ""We will confront them squarely to protect our brothers,"" Abul Qaqa said during a telephone call with local media. He also called on Muslims living in southern Nigeria to ""come back to the north because we have evidence they will be attacked."" Recent weeks have seen an escalation in clashes between Boko Haram and security forces in the north-eastern states of Borno and Yobe, as well as attacks on churches and assassinations. Nearly 30 people were killed on Christmas Day at a Catholic church near the federal capital, Abuja -- a sign that Boko Haram is prepared to strike beyond its heartland. Human rights activist Shehu Sani told CNN that the latest Boko Haram threat is credible, but many Christians born and raised in the north have nowhere else to go. ""The killings will continue,"" he said, and Boko Haram may respond to the state of emergency by taking its campaign of violence to areas not yet affected. Sani said the state of emergency and an enhanced presence of the security forces would not improve the situation, alleging that troops had already been involved in human rights abuses and had done little to reduce violence. Nigeria has almost equal numbers of Christian and Muslims, with the south predominantly Christian. Boko Haram and other Islamic groups claim the north has been starved of resources and marginalized by the government of Jonathan, who is a Christian. Boko Haram (which according to the group means ""Western civilization is forbidden"") is demanding the imposition of Islamic sharia law across Nigeria. Christian leaders have demanded a stronger response to the attacks from the government and the Muslim community. Ayo Oritsejafor, head of the Christian Association of Nigeria, complained last week that the response of Islamic leaders had been ""unacceptable and an abdication of their responsibilities."" ""The Christian community is fast losing confidence in government's ability to protect our rights,"" Oritsejafor said. David Cook of Rice University, who has studied the rise of Boko Haram, said that ""if radical Muslim violence on a systematic level were to take hold in Nigeria ... it could eventually drive the country into a civil war."" Corruption, poverty and a lack of government services have helped Boko Haram gain support, especially among young Muslims out of work. So has a perception that the Muslim north has been marginalized by a political establishment drawn largely from the Christian south. Cook says the group has been responsible for at least 45 major attacks, which have included assassinations -- frequently using gunmen on motorbikes -- and, more recently, suicide bombings beyond its northern heartland. Beyond the security forces and Christian targets, it has assassinated Muslim clerics who oppose the group, and even killed a prominent Boko Haram member who had attended talks to explore a truce. Boko Haram's presence in the city of Maiduguri has made it almost ungovernable, according to analysts. Its ability to inflict mass casualties has grown fast. In August, a suicide bomber struck the U.N. building in Abuja, killing 23 people. In November, some 150 people were killed in a series of bombings and shootings in Damaturu, capital of Yobe state. The commander of U.S. Africa Command, Gen. Carter Ham, has suggested Boko Haram may have developed links with other Islamic jihadist groups in the region, especially al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Sani agrees, and says Boko Haram's leaders have established sanctuaries across the desert borders in Niger and Chad, out of reach of the Nigerian security forces. The former U.S. ambassador in Nigeria, John Campbell, says that Boko Haram is able to finance itself ""through bank robberies and is arming itself by thefts from government armories and purchases -- there is no shortage of weapons on the market."" Less than two months ago, President Jonathan described attacks by Boko Haram as a temporary setback, which would soon be a thing of the past. Now he appears to see the group as a lethal threat that demands the full attention of the security services. But since Yusuf's death, Boko Haram has had no obvious leader or structure, and appears to act as loosely connected cells. And it is feeding on deep-seated grievances that the government seems unable to address. Cook warns that ""as more and more territories become ungovernable, such as Maiduguri, then Muslims more and more will want to join Boko Haram, if only because it represents the one group that can actually project power and hold out the illusion of security to the people.""","Boko Haram fighters are ready to confront soldiers sent to the area, a spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Was it a debate? A berating? A surreal televised ""stunt""? No matter what you call radio host Alex Jones' appearance on ""Piers Morgan Tonight,"" one thing is certain: It's generating a great deal of social media buzz. On Tuesday morning, Jones was a top-trending topic on Twitter as people read about the interview, watched clips online or shared their thoughts after watching Monday night's fiery exchange live. The man behind a petition to deport Morgan back to the UK for expressing his views on gun control went on the attack, calling the CNN host ""a hatchet man of the new world order."" ""1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!"" Jones yelled. ""It doesn't matter how many lemmings (mindless followers) you get out on the street begging for them to have their guns taken! We will not relinquish them! Do you understand?"" Morgan has pushed for stricter gun control regulations since a gunman killed 27 people before committing suicide last month in Newtown, Connecticut -- 26 of them in a mass shooting at an elementary school, including 20 children. ""I'm in favor of a nationwide ban on military-style semiautomatic assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,"" he said as he opened his Monday night show, before introducing Jones. Alex Jones: ""The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns"" Watch: 'Deport Piers Morgan' host's rant, Part 1 . Jones' petition, posted on the White House website, accuses Morgan of being ""engaged in a hostile attack against the U.S. Constitution by targeting the Second Amendment."" It has more than 100,000 signatures. Morgan prefaced his confrontation with Jones with a live report on Monday's testimony in a preliminary hearing for Aurora movie theater shooting suspect James Holmes and a live interview with relatives of two victims who died in a hail of bullets from a military-style rifle in that shooting in July. ""I appreciate you having your First Amendment right. I am glad you are speaking out,"" said Dave Hoover, whose nephew died in the movie theater. The White House also made reference to First Amendment freedoms, in a statement Monday night. ""The White House responds to all petitions that cross the threshold, and we will respond to this one,"" spokesman Jay Carney said, referring to petitions on whitehouse.gov that get at least 25,000 signatures. ""In the meantime, it's worth remembering that freedom of expression is a bedrock principle in our democracy."" Read more: Piers Morgan and guests react to various gun incidents . 'World tyranny' warning . Jones thanked Morgan for having him on the show, and then said he and others started the petition to point out that ""we have all of these foreigners"" and globalist forces, including ""megabanks that control the planet,"" trying to take away American guns. ""When they get our guns, they can have their world tyranny,"" he said. Morgan's attempt to interject questions ran up against Jones' heated chatter, leading up to a crescendo with Jones reciting a list of despotic world leaders who he said took away guns: Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Castro, Chavez. Live Blog: ""Guns in America,"" a discussion . As Jones continued, Morgan looked on, tight-lipped and silent. After 2Â½ minutes, Jones rounded off his monologue with a friendly offer to take Morgan out shooting, so he could ""become an American"" and ""join the Republic."" He also offered to climb into a boxing ring with Morgan. At the end of the interview, he imitated the Briton's English accent, before declaring him a ""Redcoat"" who should go back to where he came from. Watch: 'Deport Piers Morgan' host's rant, Part 2 . Morgan asked: ""Are you finished?"" Jones said: ""Yes."" Then he began a tirade against makers of antidepressant drugs. Jones said he owns about 50 weapons. His radio show can be heard on 140 radio shows around the country, he said. Morgan: No better advertisement for gun control . Morgan says Jones' rant backfired, making Morgan's point for him. ""I can't think of a better advertisement for gun control than Alex Jones' interview last night,"" he said Tuesday on CNN's ""Newsroom."" ""It was startling, it was terrifying in parts. It was completely deluded. It was based on a premise of making Americans so fearful that they all rush out to buy even more guns."" ""I think silence was the best weapon against him because he just dug himself an ever bigger hole,"" Morgan said, adding that Jones ""spouts dangerous nonsense."" Jones, on his website infowars.com, had an image of Morgan dressed as a ""Redcoat"" next to Jones himself dressed as a ""patriot."" A summary of his plan for Tuesday's radio show said he would discuss ""his effort to defend the Constitution and the Second Amendment from attack by the establishment media as the government prepares its latest gun-grabbing assault on law-abiding Americans."" The description adds that through the interview, ""we have put the globalists on notice."" On the program, he said that 95% of people he has heard from ""think that I just told it like it was"" and ""slammed them hard,"" delivering an important message. ""I have been overworked,"" Jones added, describing a busy schedule. ""But I did the best job I could and I'm proud of the job I did overall."" Responding to Morgan's depiction of how the interview went, Jones asked whether that was because he is ""a hillbilly that won't be your slave and knows history."" He described Morgan as being like ""a mannequin, a vampire."" 'Piers Morgan can't understand being American' Though many found fault with Jones' performance, some found common ground with his arguments. ""The tact with which Jones presented himself with was inexcusable. However; looking past that (I know... hard to do especially after that English accent he so offensively portrayed)... I have to say that his statistics were much more compelling than Piers's. I mean, ok, gun violence is higher here in America... but it has a lower violent crime rate than those countries with banned fire-arms?"" PhilipCabibi wrote in the comments section of this article. ""I see where Jones was trying to go, but unfortunately, he presented his facts in such a manner that it will turn most off to them. Which is unfortunate... because no matter how rude someone is, it doesn't change facts and it doesn't change history."" 'Meltdown' or 'punching out?' Reactions on social media were blunt. New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen called the interview a ""meltdown"" and called Jones ""revolting."" James Poniewozik, TV columnist for Time -- which, like CNN, is part of Time Warner -- wrote, sarcastically: ""Shocking: You reward a lunatic on TV for pulling a stunt,"" and he fails to ""behave with civility."" Facebook user Steve Spark made similar comments in a CNN discussion. ""If you have a nutjob as a guest, you can't be surprised when they act like a nutjob,"" he wrote, adding, ""Some might say it makes for good TV, but I think it's just embarrassing."" The Huffington Post summarized the program this way: ""Piers Morgan's pro-gun guest goes absolutely nuts at him."" Jones retweeted a supportive note from Gerald Celente, who has 36,000 followers. ""Bravo,"" the tweet said, praising Jones for ""punching out CNN Presstitute Piers Morgan."" CNN iReporter Jason Asselin posted a video saying he believes that Morgan has no right to debate gun control in America, and that only U.S. citizens should do so. Follow 'Piers Morgan Tonight' on Twitter . Piers Morgan: Sandy Hook must be a tipping point for change . Jones' appearance on ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" was followed by an interview with famed attorney and Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz. ""We lawyers refer to people like that not as witnesses, but as exhibits,"" he said of Jones. ""He was an exhibit, like a piece of evidence. You see him speaking and you say to yourself, 'I don't want that man to have a gun.'"" Dershowitz said Americans who want even-handed gun policy should not leave the arguments up to gun advocates such as the National Rifle Association and Jones without speaking up themselves. ""We have to fulfill what the real meaning of the Second Amendment is: reasonable access to guns for self-protection and for hunting. And there's no room in America for these semiautomatic, automatic and other kinds of weapons that are simply designed to cause mass havoc,"" Dershowitz said. In addition to the limitations on military-style rifles, Morgan wants gun show loopholes closed and demands that gun dealers be required to run background checks on purchasers at shows. He also advocates an increase in federal funding for mental health treatment to anyone who needs it. Morgan recently wrote a column in the Daily Mail saying that for every critic, he has had many Americans thank him for speaking up in favor of gun control. ""If you don't change your gun laws to at least try to stop this relentless tidal wave of murderous carnage, then you don't have to worry about deporting me. ""Although I love the country as a second home and one that has treated me incredibly well, I would, as a concerned parent first -- and latterly, of a one-year-old daughter who may attend an American elementary school like Sandy Hook in three years' time -- seriously consider deporting myself,"" he wrote.

"Former Arkansas Governor and presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee sparked outrage across the country this week for his offensive remarks about women and birth control. But the real problem isn't what he says -- it's what he and too many other politicians believe, and it's the policies they would advance if they have the chance. In a speech to the Republican National Committee, Huckabee said that it was wrong to give women access to no-co-pay birth control under the Affordable Care Act -- that by doing so, women were being told ""they are helpless without Uncle Sugar coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control because they cannot control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of government."" Of the thousands of types of medical care covered by insurance companies -- somehow  he and a lot of other politicians have focused like a laser on birth control -- on taking coverage away from women. Indeed, Huckabee's remarks were no ""gaffe,"" as too many pundits have called them. This is a speech he's made before, and his remarks are a look inside the playbook of politicians who appear to have no idea how birth control works and why it's so important to millions of women as a basic, preventive health care. They ignore the fact that women use birth control for a whole host of medical reasons -- and that's their business, not Mike Huckabee's. In Huckabee's vision, every boss in America would be empowered to decide whether his or her female employees should have access to birth control the way they do for any other prescription medication. Huckabee is joining a battle being waged cross the country. Over 40 for-profit companies have filed lawsuits against the birth control benefit of the Affordable Care Act, and the Supreme Court will hear arguments in two of those cases in March. If the court rules in favor of the for-profit companies, employers for the first time ever could have the right to dictate to their employees the type of health care they may have access to. Meanwhile, 20 state legislatures have moved to exempt certain employers and insurers from allowing their employees access to birth control without a co-pay.  In Kansas, pharmacists are allowed to refuse to fill a prescription for birth control if they have a moral objection -- even if there's no other pharmacist in the area that a woman can go to instead.  And while the states are individually waging separate battles, on the national front the U.S. House of Representatives approved an amendment a few months ago to roll back the birth control benefit. The politicians behind these moves disregard how important birth control is for women and families. It allows women to take control of their health and economic security and to take personal responsibility for their family planning decisions.  Many women also need birth control for medical reasons.  For example, it can help relieve painful menstrual cramps, and help avert infertility by addressing the symptoms of endometriosis. Access to birth control is also an economic issue. Until now, the cost has been expensive, with many women paying an average of $600 a year -- but sometimes much more -- for contraceptive protection. The Affordable Care Act enables 27 million women to receive their prescription birth control without a co-pay. Birth control also allows women, who make up nearly two-thirds of minimum-wage workers, to remain in the labor force. For a woman working for minimum wage at a retail store, or for tips at a restaurant, the birth control benefit is tremendously important. For many women, it means the difference between taking birth control regularly and not being able to -- between getting pregnant and not getting pregnant. As we look toward the midterm elections later this year, it's increasingly clear that access to birth control will be on the ballot. Mike Huckabee's remarks this week underscore what's at stake -- and why women will not allow out-of-touch politicians to take us back to the 1950s.","Cecile Richards: Mike Huckabee caused uproar with clueless comments about birth control .
He said women told they need goverrnment ""Uncle Sugar"" to pay for their birth control .

"Washington (CNN) -- Facing low approval ratings and constant Republican criticism as his re-election campaign starts up, President Barack Obama challenged Congress on Thursday night to put the good of the nation over political benefit and pass a huge jobs plan he proposed. In a speech to a joint session of Congress, Obama told the legislators to ""stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy"" by quickly approving the $447 billion package of measures so he can sign it into law. ""The people of this country work hard to meet their responsibilities. The question tonight is whether we'll meet ours,"" Obama said to applause. ""The question is whether, in the face of an ongoing national crisis, we can stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy. The question is whether we can restore some of the fairness and security that has defined this nation since our beginning."" Obama also told legislators that they should quickly pass his plan, called the American Jobs Act. ""There should be nothing controversial about this piece of legislation,"" the president said. ""Everything in here is the kind of proposal that's been supported by both Democrats and Republicans -- including many who sit here tonight. And everything in this bill will be paid for. Everything."" Obama said he will ask Congress to increase the $1.5 trillion target in deficit reduction being pursued by a special joint congressional committee to cover the cost of the American Jobs Act. He said he will propose his own deficit-reduction plan on September 19 that would reform entitlement programs such as Medicare while changing the tax system to end loopholes, lower the corporate tax rate and increase taxes for the wealthy. In essence, Obama resurrected his push for a so-called ""grand bargain"" -- a comprehensive deficit reduction package that includes all the drivers of government spending and deficits, including those traditionally favored and protected by both parties. Republican reaction ranged from an expressed interest in trying to work out compromise to outright rejection and criticism of what was labeled a repeat of failed policies from the past. House Speaker John Boehner, who backed out of talks with Obama on a major deficit reduction-deal deal earlier this year, said the proposals the president outlined ""merit consideration,"" and added that he hoped for serious consideration by the White House of Republican ideas. ""It's my hope that we can work together to end the uncertainty facing families and small businesses, and create a better environment for long-term economic growth and private-sector job creation,"" said Boehner, R-Ohio. Conservative Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, was much more critical. ""President Obama, perhaps not knowing what else to do, is simply calling for more of the same, as if giving us more of the failed policies of the last two-and-a-half years will somehow yield different results,"" Kyl said in a statement. ""I believe President Obama's new 'stimulus' will further delay economic recovery and continue to inflict harm on so many Americans."" The Senate's top Democrat, meanwhile, said Obama's proposal will present a ""litmus test"" for Republicans. ""I hope they (Republicans) will show the American people that they are more interested in creating jobs than defeating President Obama,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said in a statement. ""Experts from the ratings agencies to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke have said that political gridlock is the main obstacle standing in the way of our economic growth. It is time to put jobs and the economy ahead of partisan politics.""\ . That point resonated with veteran Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who joked on CNN that the president's poll numbers were very bad, but ""have you seen Congress' numbers?"" ""We seek approval, too,"" McCain said. According to Obama, the purpose of the proposed jobs legislation is ""to put more people back to work and more money in the pockets of those who are working."" ""It will create more jobs for construction workers, more jobs for teachers, more jobs for veterans, and more jobs for the long-term unemployed,"" Obama said. ""It will provide a tax break for companies who hire new workers, and it will cut payroll taxes in half for every working American and every small business. It will provide a jolt to an economy that has stalled, and give companies confidence that if they invest and hire, there will be customers for their products and services. You should pass this jobs plan right away."" He also told Republicans he would take his case directly to the American people, and called on ""every American who agrees to lift your voice and tell the people who are gathered here tonight that you want action now."" ""Tell Washington that doing nothing is not an option,"" Obama said. White House spokesman Jay Carney told CNN that Obama will send Congress jobs plan legislation next week. Obama's plan comes as unemployment remains lodged at 9.1% with no new jobs reported in August, raising fears of a possible return to recession. With 14 months to go until the presidential election, he wants the plan -- as well as the speech to Congress to present it -- to clearly illustrate to the American public the ideological differences between his policies and those of the Republican right. The mood in the House chamber was jovial before the speech, with Vice President Joe Biden playfully hugging Speaker John Boehner when he arrived at the dais. Democratic legislators repeatedly applauded during the address. House Republican and White House sources told CNN that Obama called Boehner and McConnell on Thursday afternoon to preview the speech. Even so, a legislative struggle is certain. Republicans call for corporate tax cuts and deregulation as steps to spur job growth, opposing what they label new stimulus spending. The Democratic leader in the Republican-controlled House -- Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California -- asked the ranking Democrats on committees that will consider the legislation proposed by Obama to urge their Republican chairmen to ""schedule immediate hearings and legislative action"" on the measures. Boehner, meanwhile, invited 12 business leaders -- dubbed ""job creators"" in his statement -- who have been affected by regulations enacted by the administration to attend the speech. These are ""people with real world experience on how the regulations coming out of this administration are impeding their ability to grow their business and create jobs,"" Boehner's statement said. At least five Republicans -- two senators and three House members -- didn't plan to attend the speech, which Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said was more of a political event than a policy statement. ""By all accounts, the president's so-called jobs plan is to try those very same policies again and then accuse anyone who doesn't support them this time around of being political and overly partisan, of not doing what's needed in this moment of crisis,"" McConnell, R-Kentucky, said Thursday morning. ""This isn't a jobs plan. It is a re-election plan."" Anticipating such criticism, Obama said he was proposing needed and logical measures that traditionally receive broad support. ""This isn't political grandstanding. This isn't class warfare. This is simple math,"" he said. ""These are real choices that we have to make. And I'm pretty sure I know what most Americans would choose. It's not even close. And it's time for us to do what's right for our future."" Obama said his plan would increase the current payroll tax cut to put additional money in the pockets of Americans at a cost of $175 billion. The current cut, which has cost $112 billion so far, allows employees to pay 4.2% instead of 6.2% on their first $106,800 of wages into Social Security. Obama's proposal included extended unemployment benefits, which were lengthened to the current 99-week maximum in 2009. Top Democrats argue that such money will immediately be pumped back into the economy in the form of new consumer spending. In addition, the plan proposes $60 billion for infrastructure development such as repairing roads and bridges, including establishment of an infrastructure bank to help finance such projects. Other provisions in the president's proposal include money to refurbish schools and provide state aid for teachers and first responders, and tax incentives for small businesses to hire the long-term unemployed and military veterans. Looking abroad, the president also renewed his push for congressional approval of stalled free trade deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. The measures, despite the congressional roadblock, have relatively broad bipartisan support. The president took aim at tea party conservatives who call for deep spending cuts to shrink government instead of the comprehensive approach he advocates. ""In fact, this larger notion that the only thing we can do to restore prosperity is just dismantle government, refund everyone's money, let everyone write their own rules, and tell everyone they're on their own -- that's not who we are,"" Obama said. He repeatedly urged the legislators to ""pass this jobs bill,"" using a rhetorical flourish that regularly prompted cheers and applause form Democrats. ""No single individual built America on their own,"" Obama said. ""We built it together. We have been, and always will be, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all; a nation with responsibilities to ourselves and with responsibilities to one another. Members of Congress, it is time for us to meet our responsibilities.""

"Charles Darwin once said that we can understand some parts of nature and the universe, but we can't comprehend them. For instance, take the fact that in the next 12 years, we're projected to add another billion people. Since a billion seconds equal 31.7 years, at the rate people are arriving, we can't even count them. Or that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change now says that if we want to stay below a 2-degree Celsius (3.6-degree Fahrenheit) increase in average global temperature, we can't emit any more carbon dioxide than what's released by burning 1 trillion tons of carbon. But we've already used more than half our allotment. There's a direct link between those two hard-to-grasp figures -- the more humans, the more carbon. Every mile we drive, ours cars emit about a pound of carbon dioxide. The average U.S. driver clocks 12,000 miles per year, pushing six tons of carbon out of his auto's tailpipe. The quarter-billion cars in the United States expel 150 million tons a year. In the whole world, there are now well over 1 billion cars. Those numbers are mind-boggling, even before we add the exhaust from our industries, power plants, and home heating and cooling. No, we can't easily comprehend the sheer scale of the problem, let alone imagine what we can do about it. But maybe this helps to frame it. According to the World Resources Institute, to stay on the safe side of a 2-degree Celsius increase, we'd have to go back to the amount we were expelling in 1990 -- and then cut that in half. How might we possibly do that?  It will depend on how wisely we address the matter of those billion new humans. Here are four ways to cut greenhouse gases, from the most unlikely to the most plausible: . The first is to trap them before they float skyward and start acting like glass in a greenhouse. This is possible -- theoretically.  We know how to capture carbon dioxide from smokestacks (though not from all those cars). We'd then have to dig deep holes to pump it underground and somehow keep it there. One way is to inject the gas into underground saline aquifers, turning their contents into salty carbonic acid, which would then react with surrounding rocks until the carbon dioxide becomes entombed in solid carbonates. That's very neat but very expensive. The only attempt in the United States, in West Virginia, was abandoned in 2011 by American Electric Power because it would have cost two-thirds of $1 billion, even with the Department of Energy footing half the bill. Realistically, we'll never afford this -- and we're one of the rich countries. Imagine the rest of the world doing it. The second possibility is finding new ways to produce clean energy. We must keep trying, but so far we can't concentrate enough diffuse sunlight or intermittent wind to run all our cities and factories (and it's hard to hang solar panels or wind turbines on cars). Also, a 2012 paper in Environmental Research Letters by former Microsoft chief technology officer Nathan Myhrvold and Carnegie Institution physicist Ken Caldeira showed that the carbon debt incurred by construction of renewable energy plants, including mining their materials, takes decades to amortize before their energy is truly emission-free. And exotic methods such as controlled nuclear fusion, which powers the sun's core, are enticing but perpetually decades away. Third, we can use incentives such as carbon taxes and moral persuasion to bring down energy consumption. Again, these help, and must be encouraged. Although a number of countries and some U.S. states have passed carbon taxes, consumption is exceedingly hard to control in a world where, for example, even the world's poor masses, increasingly living in cities, manage to get cell phones. Whether the power is pirated or not, they plug in their chargers nightly. Despite all our best efforts to conserve and consume less, global carbon emissions reached a record high in 2012, and keep climbing. Last, however, if we can't control consumption, we can control the number of consumers. This is technology we already have, and it's cheap. Every woman, everywhere, could have contraception. Most of us would find coercive government limits on child bearing abhorrent. But giving women access to contraception and to education makes draconian edicts unnecessary. An educated woman has an interesting and useful contribution to make to her family and her society. Since she can't easily do that with seven children hanging on her skirts, most women who get through secondary school want two children or fewer. Providing access to contraception and educating women may be the fastest path to giving our planet a break. In September, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change presented compelling evidence that seas are rising faster than ever in human history. The last time there was this much carbon in the atmosphere, at least 3 million years ago, oceans were 30 to 100 feet higher. Much of the world's most widely consumed foodstuff, rice, is grown near sea level, and the cost of protecting it with coastal dikes would be astronomical. This month, a team of University of Hawaii climate modelers added in the journal Nature that in just seven years the tropics will be experiencing average temperatures unprecedented in recorded history -- and within a generation, so will the entire planet, unless we stabilize greenhouse gases in the next 20 years. Population management can't do it all; we need a full-court press on all fronts. But if we want a secure future, we need to start with the fastest, most affordable way we know to limit carbon emissions: by bringing fewer emitters into the world.","Alan Weisman: In the next 12 years, world is expected to add another billion people .

"President Barack Obama said Sunday that the United States ""can't accept"" last week's killing of 12 people at Washington's Navy Yard as ""inevitable,"" but the shooting should instead ""lead to some sort of transformation"" on gun violence in the United States. ""It ought to be a shock to all of us, as a nation and as a people,"" Obama said at the Marine Barracks, just a few short blocks from the Navy Yard. ""It ought to obsess us. It ought to lead to some sort of transformation."" The president said during his speech that grieving with the families impacted by mass shootings is something he has had to do five times in his presidency, citing shootings in Fort Hood, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; Aurora, Colorado; Newtown, Connecticut; and now the Washington Navy Yard. ""Part of what wears on as well is the sense that this has happened before,"" Obama said. ""What wears on us, what troubles us so deeply as we gather here today, is how this senseless violence that took place in the Navy Yard, echoes other recent tragedies."" The president continued: ""Sometimes I fear there is a creeping resignation ... that this is somehow the new normal. We can't accept this."" Twelve people were killed and eight were wounded when Aaron Alexis, a Navy contractor, entered the sizable naval instillation in Washington and opened fire in Building 197. The victims, whose ages ranged from 46 to 73, all worked at the Navy Yard and many were gunned down as Alexis shot at them from above in the Navy building. The issue of gun violence has dominated much of Obama's second term in office, with a concerted effort to strengthen gun laws coming after 26 people -- including 20 children -- were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in December 2012. 'There's a guy slaughtering people with a shotgun' The push, however, eventually failed, with the lawmakers on Capitol Hill failing to pass any laws tightening gun restrictions. Groups including the National Rifle Association and Gun Owners of America vociferously protested the proposed changes. In response to last week's shooting at Navy Yard, most gun-control advocates were resigned to the fact that not much in the of legislative changes would be made in response. ""We don't have the votes,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a supporter of gun control, on Tuesday. ""I'd like to get them but we don't have them now."" The NRA, in response to the shooting, on Sunday suggested more armed guards at military installations. Obama attempted to take what he saw as acceptance of gun violence head on, worrying that mass shootings could not become the ""new normal."" ""I do not accept that we cannot find a common-sense way to preserve our traditions including our basic Second Amendment freedoms and the rights of law-abiding gun owners while at the same time reducing the gun violence that unleashes so much mayhem on a regular basis,"" Obama said, pointing to the fact that other countries, like Great Britain and Australia, lowered gun violence by restricting access to guns after mass shootings rocked their country. Throughout much of the speech, the president acknowledged a hesitance in Washington to fight over gun laws and, instead, said change would need to come because of the American people's desire for it. Who were the victims? ""It may not happen tomorrow, it may not happen next week, it may not happen next month, but it will happen, because it's the change that we need,"" the president said. Obama also used the speech to give a glimpse into the life of each of the 12 victims, mentioning everything from Arthur Daniels' love of polishing his white Crown Victoria to John Johnson's last words to his wife: ""Good-bye, beautiful. I love you so much."" ""Our tears are not enough,"" he said to the families. ""Our words and our prayers are not enough. If we really want to honor these 12 men and women, if we really want to be country where we can go to work and go to school and walk our streets free from senseless violence without so many lives being stolen by a bullet from a gun, then we're going to have to change. We're going to have to change."" Washington, D.C., Mayor Vincent Gray joined Obama on Sunday in calling for tighter gun laws in response to the shooting, telling the audience that ""our country is drowning in a sea of guns."" In taking the stage, Obama was stepping into a role he has become very familiar with, counselor-in-chief, and Sunday's remarks were reminiscent, in some ways, of past speeches he has given at memorial services for mass shootings. Reframing the gun control debate: Is mental health the next focus? Obama, however, is not the first president to play the role of counselor-in-chief. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton were praised for the leadership they showed in the aftermath of two domestic disasters -- the space shuttle Challenger explosion in 1986 and the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. Representatives from the military, including Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus and Vice Adm. William Hilarides, commander of Naval Sea Systems Command, also spoke at Sunday's event. All honored the fallen by noting that they died in the line of duty, just like those killed in battle. ""These 12 members of our Navy team, our Navy family, were killed in the line of duty, they died in the service to our nation, the service to our Navy, service they were just as committed to as anyone in uniform,"" an emotional Hilarides said. ""For that service, we honor them. For that service, we will never forget them.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano apologized Thursday after some veterans groups were offended by a department report about right-wing extremism. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano apologized to offended veterans Thursday morning. The report said extremist groups may try to attract veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also said extremists also may use the recession and the election of the nation's first African-American president to recruit members. The American Legion was among those who objected to the report's mention of veterans. ""I think it is important for all of us to remember that Americans are not the enemy. The terrorists are,"" the American Legion's national commander, David K. Rehbein, said in a letter to Napolitano. Napolitano apologized on CNN on Thursday morning. ""I know that some veterans groups were offended by the fact that veterans were mentioned in this assessment, so I apologize for that offense. It was certainly not intended,"" she told CNN's ""American Morning."" She said the report was an assessment -- not an accusation -- and said she would meet with leaders of veterans groups next week.  Watch Napolitano talk about Mexico, apology to veterans » . She noted that the Veterans of Foreign Wars, which bills itself as the nation's largest combat veterans group, defended the report. amFIX: Full Napolitano interview . Glen M. Gardner Jr., the national commander of the 2.2 million-member VFW, said the assessment ""should have been worded differently"" but served a vital purpose. ""A government that does not assess internal and external security threats would be negligent of a critical public responsibility,"" he said in a statement. The report mentioned numerous factors that could strengthen right-wing extremists, including anger over illegal immigration and the poor economy. Yet it was the section on veterans that caused controversy among conservative politicians and some veterans. It said ""the return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone-wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks."" It cited Timothy McVeigh, who returned from military service and went on to bomb the federal building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in 1995. ""Timothy McVeigh was only one of more than 42 million veterans who have worn this nation's uniform during wartime,"" wrote Rehbein, the American Legion commander. ""To continue to use McVeigh as an example of the stereotypical 'disgruntled military veteran' is as unfair as using Osama bin Laden as the sole example of Islam."" The report, which was prepared in coordination with the FBI, was published last week. It was distributed to federal, state and local law enforcement officials. Mainstream media outlets picked up the story after it was reported by conservative bloggers.  Watch how the report sparked objections » . Though the nine-page report said it had ""no specific information that domestic right-wing terrorists are currently planning acts of violence,"" it said real-estate foreclosures, unemployment and tight credit ""could create a fertile recruiting environment for right-wing extremists and even result in confrontations between such groups and government authorities similar to those in the past."" The report compared the current climate with that of the 1990s, saying a recession, criticism over outsourcing of jobs, and a perceived threat to U.S. power at that time fueled a ""resurgence"" of right-wing extremism. However, it said, ""Despite similarities to the climate of the 1990s, the threat posed by lone wolves and small terrorist cells is more pronounced than in past years."" It warned that the groups may use proposed restrictions on firearms and the debate on immigration as recruiting tools, and said the groups may try to reach out to veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh decried the report on Tuesday, saying, ""There is not one instance they can cite as evidence where any of these right-wing groups have done anything,"" according to a transcript of his remarks on his Web site. ""You have a report from Janet Napolitano and Barack Obama, Department of Homeland Security, portraying standard, ordinary, everyday conservatives as posing a bigger threat to this country than al Qaeda terrorists or genuine enemies of this country like Kim Jong Il,"" he said, referring to the leader of North Korea. Michael Savage, another conservative commentator, also criticized the report. ""What does Big Sis say these right-wingers are concerned about?"" he wrote on his Web site, referring to Napolitano. ""Illegal aliens, the increasing power of the federal government, gun grabs, abortion and the loss of U.S. national sovereignty. In other words, anyone who is worried about preserving our borders, language, and culture is on Big Sis' watch list."" In a written statement Wednesday, Napolitano said the agency is on ""the lookout for criminal and terrorist activity but we do not -- nor will we ever -- monitor ideology or political beliefs."" She said she was ""briefed"" on the general topic, which ""struck a nerve as someone personally involved in the Timothy McVeigh prosecution."" Napolitano said in her statement that she will tell Rehbein face-to-face that the Department of Homeland Security honors veterans and employs thousands of them, including Deputy Secretary Jane Holl Lute. The Obama administration in January issued a warning about left-wing extremists. Both reports were initiated during the administration of former President George W. Bush.","Janet Napolitano regrets line in report on extremist groups .

"A young woman leaves her farming village at age 16 to find work in a distant city. With three younger children at home, her parents can't afford to keep her in school. Her first job, on a factory assembly line, pays only $50 a month. Over two years she takes night-school classes, gets a series of secretarial jobs, and lands a coveted position in a factory's purchasing department that pays more than $1,000 a month. She meets a young man, a fellow migrant; they marry and have two children. The couple saves enough money to buy an apartment for her parents and a secondhand Buick for themselves. Then the young woman leaves her daughters in the temporary care of her husband and his parents, so she can return to the city to work again. ""A person should have some ambition while she is young,"" she writes, ""so that in old age she can look back on her life and feel that it was not lived to no purpose."" Watch Leslie Chang's TED Talk . The outlines of this young woman's story are familiar; she could be one of the millions of immigrants who crossed an ocean to make a new life in America. We acknowledge that their lives were hard, but we believe that with adversity came opportunity and transformation. But if I tell you that this woman's name is Lu Qingmin, and that she lives in China, all such possibility seems to fall away. She is recast as a victim of the world's largest authoritarian regime, where workers earn less than a dollar an hour and independent unions are against the law. Her story becomes one of misery and exploitation. How could it be otherwise? I spent two years getting to know assembly line workers in the south China factory city of Dongguan. These young men and women labored long hours every day, sometimes for weeks on end without a break; the best factories gave one day off each week. A government-mandated 11-hour workday was routinely ignored, and factories frequently paid less than the minimum wage or withheld pay for minor infractions. Injuries on the factory floor resulted from safety violations and minimal employee training. Workers might sleep 10 or 15 to a room, with 50 people sharing one bathroom. TED.com: Behind the great firewall of China . Yet these workers did not strike me as cowed; despite their youth and inexperience, they were capable and resourceful at improving their situations over time. Almost every worker I met told me a story of challenging her boss over some injustice, which frequently led her superiors to take notice and treat her better. The workers figured out who were the best employers, took private classes to learn computer or secretarial skills and talked their way into higher-paying jobs. They became the chief earners in their families and challenged long-held traditions. They urged their parents to keep younger siblings in school; they resisted pressure to marry early and return to a way of life they no longer wanted. For these young women, the factory experience could not be boiled down to a set of working conditions. It also changed their lives. Surveys have shown that Chinese migrants are younger and better educated than the people who stay behind in the village, and that they choose to leave home as much to see the world and to develop new skills as to earn money. Factory work is an informed choice, not a desperate response to poverty. Other studies by Chinese and Western scholars show that migration fuels economic growth, social mobility and the spread of progressive ideas. Income from migrant work is the biggest source of wealth accumulation in rural China. TED.com: The generation that's remaking China . By 2025, McKinsey & Co. has estimated, the Chinese middle class will swell to 520 million people, most of them former migrants who have done well in the cities and stayed. One study has shown that having done migrant work makes a rural woman more likely to choose her own husband, to give birth in a hospital, and to seek equality in marriage. It's possible to acknowledge that the Chinese factory regime has immense problems but that it also brings benefits to individuals within that system. Perhaps Chinese workers deserve our interest and respect instead of our pity. Just to say these things makes some people angry. Since my TED talk on Chinese factory workers was posted online, I have been accused of working in league with the technology industry to perpetuate the enslavement of Chinese workers. ""You sicken me with your effort to discount the negatives of factory workers in China by making it sound like the workers want this,"" one person wrote. What accounts for such visceral reactions? One answer lies in the nature of daily journalism. By focusing on extreme events, such as a violent brawl earlier this week at a Foxconn Technology plant that manufactures for Apple, journalists create the impression of an enormous underclass on the edge of revolt. TED.com: Does democracy stifle economic growth? Write about ordinary workers who have not endured violent protests or extraordinary suffering, and you may be attacked for hiding the truth or shilling for the corporations. A widespread fear of China—a monolithic force that is taking over the world and stealing American jobs—blinds people to the complexities of life there. The Chinese government is not a democracy, yet its economic policies over the past three decades have improved the lives of millions. But it's far easier to believe that everyone there is exploited and miserable. It's true that Chinese factories have harsh conditions. It's also true that Chinese factories have allowed huge numbers of people to improve their lives and change their fates. This same set of contradictory facts characterized America's industrialization more than a hundred years ago. To insist on seeing China in black and white reflects an ignorance of history and a failure of the imagination. Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter .","Leslie T.

"The Chicago teachers strike drags into a second week, after a representative group of the Chicago Teachers Union decided over the weekend not to end the walkout even though union leaders and school officials had reached a tentative contract deal. The strike in the third-largest school system in the country is affecting more than 350,000 children. A quick primer: . Q. What's the sticking point? A. Among the major issues, the teachers are negotiating over the length of the school day, objecting to their evaluations being tied to performance and fretting about potential job losses. Q. How would the length of school days change? A. Elementary students would gain 75 minutes to create a seven-hour school day.  High school students would gain 30 minutes to create a seven-and-a-half-hour school day. Teachers wants additional money to teach the additional hours. Chicago mayor takes strike fight to court . Q. Why are teachers objecting to evaluations tied to performance? A. The union says student performance is directly linked to conditions in the home or neighborhood, making it unfair for teachers to be punished if students don't do well in the the classroom for those reasons. Q. How many jobs will be lost under the evaluation plan? A. As many as 6,000 teachers could lose their jobs under the evaluation system, according to CTU President Karen Lewis, who has called the system ""unacceptable.""  The mayor's office, the city and school officials have questioned that job-loss figure. Q. How many school closings are being talked about? A. The teachers union says 200 schools will be closed, but Marielle Sainvilus, a spokeswoman for Chicago Public Schools, calls the claim ""false,"" asserting that union leaders said recently that 100 schools would close.  ""I'm sure it'll be another number tomorrow,"" she said. Q. What is the status of the strike? A. The Chicago Teachers Union will make no decision Monday.  They are taking the day off for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is vowing to go to court to force teachers back to work, calling Sunday's actions by the union ""a delay of choice that is wrong for our children.""  He announced in a statement that he's asked city lawyers to file an injunction in circuit court to ""immediately end this strike."" My view: From the picket lines . Q. What's next? A. The House of Delegates, a group of 800 union representatives, will reconvene Tuesday afternoon, at which point delegates could decide to end the strike. If they do, classes would resume no earlier than Wednesday.  The rank-and-file of the Chicago Teachers Union would still have the opportunity at some point to accept, or reject, the proposed contract. But as of Sunday, Lewis said a ""clear majority"" of union delegates did not want to suspend the strike given the proposed contract, saying ""they are not happy with the agreement."" Q. How many teachers are in the union and how much do Chicago teachers make? A. The Chicago Teachers Union represents 26,000 teachers.  Chicago has the nation's third-largest school system with some 35,000 students, and its teachers are among the highest paid in the country. The median base salary for teachers in the Chicago public schools in 2011 was $67,974, according to the system's annual financial report. Q. What sort of raise are they being offered? A. The pay structure would change with a 3% pay hike for the first year of the contract, 2% for the second year and 2% for the third year. If a trigger extends the contract to four years, teachers would get a 3% pay increase. Union members would no longer be compensated for unused personal days, health insurance contribution rates will be frozen and the ""enhanced pension program"" is being eliminated. Q. How is the public reacting to the strike? A. The reaction is predictably mixed in the pro-union town. Parents have had to juggle work schedules and lay out money for child care, but many remain supportive of the union's action. Q. What do the presidential candidates have to say? A. Mayor Rahm Emanuel is President Barack Obama's former chief of staff, but the White House has had little to say about the strike. Unions are a major support base for the Democratic Party. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, meanwhile, has tried to make political hay, saying, ""I am disappointed by the decision of the Chicago Teachers Union to turn its back on not only a city negotiating in good faith but also the hundreds of thousands of children relying on the city's public schools to provide them a safe place to receive a strong education.""

"(CNN)Climbers conquer Everest. Runners complete the marathon. And globe-trotters master the ultralonghaul flight. Amazing advances in technology now let nonstop flights fly farther and cheaper for airlines than ever before. Many follow routes that take them near the North Pole as they whip over the top of the globe to the other side of the world. But these giant intercontinental leaps present their own challenges: How do passengers and pilots deal with annoying and potentially dangerous fatigue that comes with marathon air travel? How do twin-engine planes figure into the future of longhauls? Let's start with the king of nonstop flights: Singapore Airlines Flights 21 and 22 between Singapore and Newark, New Jersey. The route is the longest both in distance -- about 9,500 miles -- and in time -- about 19 hours. Business traveler Charles Yap is a big fan of this route because it avoids a connection in Germany, which he says saves six hours. All 100 seats aboard the flight are business class. Add hundreds of in-flight movie choices, and longhaul travel isn't so bad for this Discovery Channel executive. ""If you're stuck on a flight, you might as well enjoy it,"" says Yap, 39. His long-distance travel tips for surviving 19 hours aloft: ""Walk around. Explore the cabin. Don't force yourself to sleep."" Ah yesssssssss, ssssssssslumber. Conversations with ultralonghaulers inevitably will turn to the subject of sleep. Specifically, avoiding jet lag. ""You should try on the day before to get on the same clock as your destination,"" advises Chris Uriarte, 36, an American Express exec who's flown the route about a dozen times. ""For long west-to-east flights -- a day or two before you leave, start moving your bedtime earlier in the evening. For long east-to-west flights, try to delay sleep until late at night. Planning ahead makes you a lot more productive when you hit the ground."" Uriarte should know. He logs more than 200,000 flight miles a year. Your seating position on the plane is ""absolutely key,"" to a good longhaul, Uriarte says. Singapore uses Airbus A340s with a spacious 1-2-1 seating configuration. The back two rows are even better with 1-1-1 seating. In general, Uriarte recommends aisle seats in the center section. Sleeping is easier when ""there's no one climbing over you,"" he says. Seats behind the plane's four wing-mounted engines will be louder, but some travelers enjoy being lulled to sleep by the jet noise. 'Dr. Sleepgood' Sleep is Curt Graeber's business. During his 19 years as Boeing's chief engineer for human factors, pilots nicknamed Graeber ""Dr. Sleepgood"" because he helped them manage fatigue on longhaul flights. ""Buy a seat that has a bed, and you're fine,"" Graeber says with a chuckle. (The price tag -- often thousands of dollars -- is the real challenge.) Sleeping in a coach seat is no easy feat, Graeber acknowledges. Try to sleep at the time when your body is asleep, he says, although ""that's not always possible."" And avoid eating a heavy meal. For the traveler, avoiding exhaustion is nice if you can swing it. For pilots, it's critical.

Source: Singapore Airlines passengers . Graeber ran a 1989 NASA/Federal Aviation Administration study that recommended allowing U.S. pilots to catnap in the cockpit -- but only under supervision of another pilot. Cockpit napping is allowed for pilots in Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere. It's been accepted by the International Civil Aviation Organization. The FAA won't allow it. ""Longhaul flights require relief crews,"" the FAA said in a written statement to CNN. ""Rest is provided outside the cockpit. The FAA does not permit napping in the cockpit on U.S. air carriers."" The FAA's rejection of cockpit napping ""doesn't makes any sense,"" Graeber says. ""Everyone I talk to who uses it says it's an important stopgap measure to improve safety and reduce sleep loss."" Related: UK probes whether pilots fell asleep . National Transportation Safety Board investigators said they were concerned that pilot fatigue was a factor in July's deadly crash landing of Asiana Airlines Flight 214, a Boeing 777 which caught fire on a San Francisco runway after a 10-hour flight from South Korea. The NTSB has not yet issued a final report on the reasons behind the crash. International longhaul pilot Justin Schlechter says he's seen the effects of flight fatigue firsthand. ""It's tough,"" Schlechter admits. ""It affects your reasoning surrounding your flying and the speed that your brain processes information."" Schlechter predicts that the FAA eventually will reverse itself and allow cockpit catnaps. ""The international standard allows it,"" he says. ""I think it's safer to take a controlled catnap. I'm in favor of it."" Here's what U.S. longhaul pilots are allowed to do to manage fatigue: . Typically, during a 14-hour flight, the captain and first officer will fly the first three hours. Then, they hand off the plane to a second crew and get some rest in a special compartment -- or in reserved seats in the passenger cabin. During the cruise portion of the longhaul, pilots use various methods to keep sharp, such as checking fuel consumption and navigation, adjusting the ventilation, turning up cockpit lighting and engaging in energetic discussions with the other pilot. Every three hours, the two crews will switch off command of the cockpit until about 90 minutes before landing, when the captain and first officer will land the aircraft. Twin-engine longhaulers . So, those are some of the ultralonghaul challenges for humans. As for the machines -- they have their own hurdles. Obviously over vast oceans it's critically important for airliner engines to be reliable and powerful. But hey, it's a business, so the engines also have to be efficient enough to keep airline fuel costs low. The twin-engine Boeing 777 holds the long-distance commercial airliner record. In 2005 it flew 13,423 miles from Hong Kong to London. Total time: 22 hours, 22 minutes. Decades ago, that meant ultralonghaulers were likely four-engine planes, like the 747. In the unlikely event that an engine failed, the other three engines could power the plane the rest of the trip, no problem. The downside: Four engines guzzle a lot of fuel. ""Now, engines are way more reliable,"" says travel expert and former airline manager Brett Snyder of CrankyFlier.com. They're also more powerful and fuel-saving. That's why Boeing's twin-engine 777 Worldliner flies so many of the world's longest nonstop routes. In the coming years look for newer wide-bodies to fly more longhaul routes, like Boeing's twin-engine 787 Dreamliner and the twin-engine Airbus A350 XWB. Both aircraft are made with superlightweight materials which also cut down on fuel costs. Already, United Airlines has announced its Dreamliners will begin 14-hour nonstop service from San Francisco to Chengdu, China. British Airways plans to use the plane for a 10-hour nonstop from Austin, Texas, to London. The FAA requires twin-engine planes to fly within close reach of a safe landing spot, in case of engine trouble. Some travelers seem intrigued by the idea that an airliner can fly in a straight line with only one engine. ""Wouldn't the thrust from the engine be unbalanced and make the plane fly in circles?"" they ask. If a 777 lost one of its two engines, the plane has a computer that automatically adjusts the aircraft's controls to compensate for unbalanced thrust. Pilots flying other airliners may have to manually adjust the plane to compensate. How reliable are those engines? ""We've never seen an issue where a twin-engine plane has lost one engine during a transoceanic flight and can't make it somewhere with the other engine,"" says Snyder. ""And engines almost never fail. With high reliability, airlines are free to look at economics and say, 'Why would we have aircraft with four engines when we can have one that performs the same mission with two and save us money?'"" What killed the longest flight in the world? In fact, money is exactly what's being blamed for killing the longest flight in the world. That's right -- after nine years of service, Singapore Airlines Flights 21 and 22 are scheduled for cancellation. Snyder and most other experts suspect the airline got tired of dealing with poor profit margins on the fuel-guzzling four-engine Airbus A340. ""They do use a ton of fuel, and that's always painful,"" says Snyder. ""But the schedule advantage isn't that great either when you fly so far."" Also, the world's second-longest nonstop -- a Singapore Airlines 18-hour flight between Singapore and LAX -- is scheduled to be canceled this month. That will leave Qantas Flight 7, a Boeing 747 from Sydney to Dallas, atop the list of world's longest nonstops by distance, at 8,600 miles. The longest nonstop by time will be Delta's Flight 201 -- a 777 from Atlanta to Johannesburg which clocks in at about 17 hours. Fans of the Singapore-Newark flight say they'll miss its spacious seats and well-trained flight attendants. On a Singapore passenger website, commenter Buster CT1K -- tongue firmly in cheek -- called the airline's decision to cancel the flight a ""very sad day in the history of aerospace and aviation. First, man stops going to the moon. Then the space shuttle stops flying. Then Concorde stops flying. And now this. I will miss the Newark-Singapore nonstop very much."" The way Amex exec Uriarte sees it, for now, the airline industry appears to have pushed the longhaul envelope to the maximum. ""That's about as long as we're going to get,"" he says. ""The days of the 19-hour flight are over."" CNN's Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","World's longest nonstop flight (19 hours) linking Singapore and Newark canceled .

"DES MOINES, Iowa (CNN) -- Barack Obama and Mike Huckabee have claimed victories in Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses. With all Democratic precincts reporting, Obama had the support of 38 percent of voters, compared to 30 percent for John Edwards and 29 percent for Hillary Clinton. ""The numbers tell us this was a debate between change and experience, and change won,"" said CNN political analyst Bill Schneider. Iowa delivered fatal blows to the campaigns of Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware. Both have decided to abandon their White House runs. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who finished fourth, said his campaign plans to ""take the fight to New Hampshire."" New Hampshire holds the nation's first primary Tuesday. Clinton and Obama are in a statistical dead heat in New Hampshire, according to the latest CNN/WMUR poll.  Watch where millions of dollars and months of campaigning have left candidates » . On the GOP side, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, whose campaign was languishing six months ago, and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney are now tied for first place in New Hampshire, according to the poll, which was released Wednesday. McCain left Iowa before caucus night even began.  He was already in New Hampshire by Thursday afternoon, trying to get a jump on his rivals. For the winners of both party's caucuses in Iowa, it's an age revolt for Democrats versus a religious revolt for Republicans, Schneider said. Among Democrats, Obama took 57 percent of the under-30 vote, according to CNN's analysis of entrance polls. Watch Obama celebrate his victory . Speaking to supporters, Obama called the night a ""defining moment in history."" ""You came together as Democrats, Republicans and independents to stand up and say that we are one nation, we are one people and our time for change has come.""  Watch an audio slideshow of the candidates' speeches » . Huckabee's victory can be attributed to his overwhelming support among evangelical voters and women, the polls indicate. With 92 percent of Republican precincts reporting, Huckabee, former governor of Arkansas, had the support of 34 percent of voters, compared to 25 percent for Romney. Fred Thompson had 13 percent, McCain had 13 percent and Ron Paul had 10 percent.  What do the results mean? » . Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who has turned the focus of his campaign to the February 5 ""Super Tuesday"" primaries, trailed with 4 percent. ""We've paid a lot of attention to states that some other candidates haven't paid a lot of attention to,"" Giuliani said, adding, ""Time will tell what the best strategy is.""  Watch Giuliani describe his strategy » . Huckabee was vastly outspent by Romney, who poured millions of dollars into a sophisticated get-out-the-vote operation. ""People really are more important than the purse, and what a great lesson for America to learn,"" Huckabee said in thanking his supporters.  Watch Huckabee claim victory » . For most of 2007, Huckabee languished in the single digits in the polls and had very little success raising money. But his momentum picked up in the final six weeks of the year when social conservatives -- an important voting bloc in Iowa -- began to move his way. ""We won the silver ... You win the silver in one event. It doesn't mean you're not going to come back and win the gold in the final event, and that we are going to do,"" Romney said. Clinton, speaking with 96 percent of the vote in, portrayed herself as the candidate who could bring about the change the voters want. ""I am so ready for the rest of this campaign, and I am so ready to lead,"" she said. Clinton had worked to convince Iowa caucus-goers she has the experience to enact change, while Edwards and Obama preached that she is too much of a Washington insider to bring change to the nation's capital. Edwards, in a tight race for second, said Iowa's results show that ""the status quo lost and change won.""  Watch Edwards describe his next move » . ""Now we move on ... to determine who is best suited to bring about the changes this country so desperately needs,"" he said. McCain, who had largely abandoned Iowa to focus on the New Hampshire primary, said, ""The lessons of tonight's election in Iowa are that one, you can't buy an election in Iowa; and two, that negative campaigns don't work.""  Watch what McCain says about the results » . With such a close race on both sides, voter turnout was key. The Iowa Democratic Party reported seeing record turnout. The party said there were at least 227,000 caucus attendees. The Iowa GOP projected that 120,000 people took part in the Republican caucuses.  See how candidates courted voters » . The Iowa Democratic Party said 124,000 people participated in the 2004 caucuses, while the Republican Party of Iowa estimated that 87,000 people took part in the 2000 caucuses. (President Bush ran unchallenged for a second term in 2004.) Caucus-goer Kathy Barger, inside a Democratic caucus site in Walnut, Iowa, said the room she was in was packed to the brim with a line out the door.  Watch what it was like inside the caucus » . ""I don't know how they are going to be able to fit everybody in the room, much less count the votes,"" she said. ""There are bodies in every available space in the room."" The White House hopefuls campaigned down to the wire in Iowa, determined to reach as many people as possible before the 1,781 caucuses that started at 7 p.m. Iowa Democrats, unlike Republicans, use a more complicated system to determine a candidate's viability. Republican caucus-goers are asked for their support for a candidate only one time during the event. Democrats are asked twice: an initial question of support, and a second if their first-choice candidate does not reach a 15 percent threshold to achieve viability. Among Republican candidates, Thompson, a former senator from Tennessee, and Rep. Duncan Hunter of California needed strong showings in Iowa to keep their campaigns going, while Paul, a representative from Texas, is likely to ride his surge of popularity through February 5 -- ""Super Tuesday,"" when 24 states hold their primaries --  no matter where he places in the early contests.

"Female Formula One driver Maria de Villota is conscious after suffering ""severe facial and head injuries""  in a crash during a test event on Tuesday. The Spanish racer, one of only two female drivers involved in the sport, was in Britain driving the Marussia team's MR-01 car for the first time when she struck a stationary truck. Emergency medical charity Magpas confirmed it had treated a woman in her 30s after a slow-speed Formula One crash at Duxford in the county of Cambridgeshire. A later statement from Marussia confirmed De Villota had received hospital treatment and the tests were still being conducted on her at  Addenbrookes Hospital. ""Since Maria's arrival at the hospital at approximately 1045 BST, she has been receiving the best medical attention possible at the hospital, which is the region's major trauma centre,"" said the Russian-owned team. ""Maria is conscious and medical assessments are ongoing. The team will await the outcome of these assessments before providing further comment. ""The team's first priority at this time is Maria and her family."" Earlier in the day, Marussia had said: ""At approximately 0915 this morning, Maria De Villota had an accident in the team's MR-01 race car at Duxford Airfield where she was testing the car for the first time. ""The accident happened at the end of her first installation run and involved an impact with the team's support truck. Maria has been transferred to hospital. Once her medical condition has been assessed a further statement will be issued."" The 32-year-old Spaniard joined Britain-based Marussia in July, after a career which had included spells in Spanish Formula Three, the Euroseries 3000 and the Daytona 24 Hours. The Madrid-born racer is the daughter of former March team Formula One driver Emilio de Villota. De Villota made her debut behind the wheel of an F1 car when testing for Lotus Renault in August 2011. The only other female driver currently contracted in the elite division of motorsport is Britain's Susie Wolff, who is a development driver with Williams.","Maria de Villota hospitalized after a crash during a test event on Tuesday .

"New York Yankees player Alex Rodriguez walked out of an arbitration hearing into his record-setting 211-game suspension on Wednesday after learning Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig would not testify, saying later that he's done with what he called a ""farce"" and an ""abusive process."" After arbitrator Fred Horowitz made the decision on Selig, Rodriguez slammed his hand on a desk, looked at MLB Chief Operating Officer Rob Manfred and then at Horowitz, and cursed, a source who was in the room in New York told CNN. The Yankees third baseman then walked out, according to the source. Later, Rodriguez appeared on WFAN radio, which was simulcast on the YES cable TV network, and said he will meet with his attorneys to decide whether he will testify Friday, as scheduled. As of now, if Selig doesn't appear, Rodriguez won't either, he said. One of his attorneys told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live"" that Selig needs to answer questions about the suspension. ""Come here, sit in the chair, take an oath, explain your unprecedented, unexplainable decision to make the suspension,"" attorney Joe Tacopina told CNN. ""What this really is, is cowardice and hypocrisy."" Rodriguez is appealing his suspension, which MLB levied after accusing him of taking performance-enhancing drugs and having ties to the now-shuttered Biogenesis clinic. After leaving the hearing, Rodriguez released a statement saying he was ""disgusted with this abusive process, designed to ensure that the player fails."" ""I have sat through 10 days of testimony by felons and liars, sitting quietly through every minute, trying to respect the league and the process,"" Rodriguez said. ""This morning after Bud Selig refused to come in and testify about his rationale for the unprecedented and totally baseless punishment he hit me with, the arbitrator selected by MLB and the players' association refused to order Selig to come in and face me. ""The absurdity and injustice just became too much. I walked out and will not participate any further in this farce."" A spokesman for Major League Baseball told CNN that the league will continue to take part. ""Despite Mr. Rodriguez being upset with one of the arbitration panel's rulings today, Major League Baseball remains committed to this process and to a fair resolution of the pending dispute,"" Pat Courtney said. The players' union said it disagrees with the decision that the commissioner doesn't have to testify, saying players have the right to face their accusers. Rodriguez told WFAN he invited Selig to talk in person in early in 2013 but the commissioner declined. ""I think they wanted this big spectacle, and they got it,"" he said on WFAN. He said Selig has a personal problem with him and is ""trying to destroy me."" Rodriguez lashes out against MLB commissioner . The suspension involves Biogenesis, the former anti-aging clinic in South Florida that MLB says supplied steroids to at least a dozen baseball players. Rodriguez was one of 14 players suspended in the Biogenesis scandal and is the only one who appealed his suspension. Though he was suspended in August, Rodriguez played out the 2013 season because he appealed. Rodriguez, 38, is fifth on MLB's list of all-time home run leaders, just six runs behind Willie Mays. He would make $25 million in 2014 if his suspension is overturned. If his suspension is upheld, he won't be eligible to return until 49 games into the 2015 season.

"(CNN) -- The show ""Archer"" has decided to use some levity to deal with a name that is far from funny these days. The adult animated FX series focuses on operative Sterling Malory Archer (voiced by actor H. Jon Benjamin), who works for the New York-based International Secret Intelligence Service, or ISIS. Given the negative connotation now attached to the name, the Daily Beast reports that it will be phased out when the show returns in January. Creator Adam Reed said he and the executive producers Casey Willis and Matt Thompson decided that the name will go away in the first show of season 6. Reed said he suspected it might become an issue as the terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria began to make headlines. ""Back in season 5, FX said, 'This might be a thing,' and I thought, 'Maybe it won't be? Maybe it'll be the mole that I'm gonna ignore and nothing will happen,' "" he told the Daily Beast. ""We got sort of lucky and could organically make a merger with the CIA, so we went back and retroactively painted out the ISIS logos in parts of the show, and we just don't talk about it in dialogue."" Fans will see two movers pushing out the large circular blue ISIS sign while spy Malory Archer (voiced by veteran actress Jessica Walter) explains to her son that they now work for the CIA. ""It's just the most awful thing, and we didn't want to have anything to do with it,"" Thompson said. ""There were people online saying that we should address it and say, 'Oh, I can't believe these guys have co-opted our name.'

"Maybe. That's the verdict from scientists trying to answer a question that has riveted people around the Middle East and beyond for nearly a decade: Did someone kill Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat by poisoning him with a radioactive isotope? His widow insists he was assassinated, a conclusion scientists who have completed an exhaustive study of the evidence did not reject, but said Thursday they could not confirm either. ""Was polonium the cause of death?"" asked professor Francois Bouchud, director of Lausanne University Hospital's Institute of Radiation Physics about Yasser Arafat's death in 2004 in a Paris military hospital. ""Our study has not been able to prove categorically a hypothesis of poisoning or another of non-poisoning by polonium."" He was fielding questions from reporters in Lausanne, Switzerland, about his group's work a day after Al Jazeera released a report prepared by his laboratory that concluded that levels of polonium-210 measured in Arafat's personal effects and in tissues from his exhumed body ""moderately"" support a proposition that he died of polonium poisoning. Bouchud said Thursday that the results ""support reasonably the hypothesis of poisoning"" by polonium, but he bemoaned the lack of tissue samples from just after death, which the hospital has destroyed. ""If we had access to samples, we could be more categorical. Unfortunately, they disappeared."" Still, ""Poisoning from polonium-210 was possible,"" Bouchud said. The findings, released by the University Center of Legal Medicine of Lausanne, do not address how Arafat, who died at age 75, might have been poisoned or who might have done it. Bouchud also cited the passage of nine years since Arafat died as a complicating factor. The half-life of polonium is 138 days, which means less than a millionth of the isotope that was present at death would still be there. A polonium expert who was not involved in the work praised the Swiss researchers' efforts as scientifically sound, but said they were given a tough job. ""It's like a blindfolded man holding the tail of an elephant and using that to estimate the weight of the elephant,"" said Paddy Regan, a professor of radionuclide metrology in the physics department at the University of Surrey in Guildford, England. ""You can do it, but there is a huge amount of extrapolation involved."" And the mere presence of the isotope -- even in amounts significantly higher than what occurs naturally -- does not necessarily mean that that is what killed Arafat, he told CNN in a telephone interview, citing the scientists' measurement of a urine stain on Arafat's underwear. ""If you were being cynical about such a thing, if you wanted to put a false trail out there, you could put a tiny amount of polonium-210 on that urine stain. That doesn't mean that the urine stain came from inside him."" Regan described the amount of polonium needed to kill a man as ""terrifyingly small ...the size of a grain of salt, something like that."" Professor Patrice Mangin, director of the forensics center at Lausanne University Hospital, underscored the uncertainty. ""We have never said in a categorical way we have the absolute proof that we're dealing with polonium poisoning,"" he said. But that caution was not shared by Arafat's widow. ""I'm convinced it was a political murder, a political assassination,"" Suha Arafat told CNN in a telephone interview from Doha, the capital of Qatar. ""They wanted to get rid of him,"" she said, without saying who ""they"" are. ""I'm not pointing fingers, but this polonium came from a nuclear reactor, and the next step is to identify its source."" It was her suspicions that led authorities to exhume Arafat's body after polonium-210 was found last year on his personal belongings. Yet another complication: The chain of custody of Arafat's personal effects -- from the time he died to 2012, when the center began to study them -- is unclear. But the report said that Suha Arafat had ""certified that the measured personal effects have been stored in a secured room."" Invoices for the two analyses, whose cost Mangin would not disclose, were sent to the Palestinian Authority and to Suha Arafat. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has ordered that a probe into his predecessor's death continue ""to reveal the complete truth to the Palestinian people and the entire world,"" presidential spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh told WAFA, the official Palestinian news agency, on Thursday. What polonium does to the body . The report may renew suspicions over how Arafat -- the most prominent face of Palestinian opposition to Israel for five decades -- died. The Palestinian Authority, which runs the West Bank, has said Israel would have been behind any poisoning of Arafat, who was regarded by many Palestinians as a father figure. ""I believe that all fingers are pointed at the Israeli occupation ... who have experience in such cases of poisoning,"" said Wasel Abu Yousef, a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Yousef called for a ""criminal international committee"" to be formed to look into the report. An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said Wednesday that any such accusation would be ""utter nonsense."" ""This is nothing to do with us, and for the moment they refrained (from) making accusations,"" Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said. ""They know why -- there's no strictly no connection to Israel."" French prosecutors launch murder inquiry in Arafat's death . Arafat, who first led the Palestine Liberation Organization and then the Palestinian Authority, died in November 2004 after suffering a stroke, ending weeks of illness. Palestinian officials said in the days before his death that Arafat had a blood disorder -- though they ruled out leukemia -- and that he had digestive problems. Rumors of poisoning circulated at the time, but the Palestinian Authority's then-foreign minister, Nabil Shaath, said he ""totally"" ruled them out. French authorities, responding to a request from Arafat's widow, opened a murder inquiry last year after the isotope was found on Arafat's toothbrush, clothing and his keffiyeh, the black-and-white headscarf he often wore. France opened the investigation partly because Arafat died there. Forensic experts from Switzerland and Russia took their own samples for independent analysis. Radiation poisoning caused by polonium-210 looks like the end stage of cancer, according to medical experts. The substance can enter the body via a wound or through contaminated food, drink or even air.

"(CNN) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton said she ""misspoke"" last week when she gave a dramatic description of her arrival in Bosnia 12 years ago, recounting a landing under sniper fire. Clinton was responding to a question Monday from the Philadelphia Daily News' editorial board about video footage of the event that contradicted her assertion that her group ""ran with our heads down"" from the plane to avoid sniper fire at the Tuzla Air Base. Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for rival Sen. Barack Obama's campaign, said the Bosnia claim was part of ""a growing list of instances in which Sen. Clinton has exaggerated her role in foreign and domestic policymaking."" Clinton told the paper's editorial board it was a ""minor blip.""  Watch how Clinton described her trip » . ""I say a lot of things -- millions of words a day -- so if I misspoke, that was just a misstatement,"" she said. In a radio interview that aired Tuesday, Clinton said she wasn't worried about the incident hurting her credibility. ""I have been in the public eye for many, many years, and this is something that I think happens to anybody,"" she told radio station KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In a foreign policy speech last week at George Washington University, Clinton used the description of a dangerous arrival to bolster her argument that she has the foreign policy experience needed to be commander in chief. She said when she arrived in Bosnia on March 25, 1996, ""I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base."" But news video footage of her arrival at Tuzla shows Clinton, then the first lady, calmly walking from the rear ramp of a U.S. Air Force plane with her daughter, Chelsea, then 16, at her side. Both Clintons held their heads up and did not appear rushed. The video shows Clinton spending several minutes talking with the group, including an 8-year-old Bosnian girl who presented her with a poem, and later greeting U.S. troops. Clinton has mentioned the sniper fire at least twice earlier in the campaign, including in December in Dubuque, Iowa, before the caucuses in that state. Clinton's campaign has made foreign policy experience a centerpiece of her effort to come back against Obama, whom she is trailing in delegates for the Democratic presidential nomination.  Watch a report on the Bosnia story and other political news » . During Monday's editorial meeting -- in which Clinton was seeking the Daily News' endorsement ahead of Pennsylvania's April 22 primary -- she was asked about the apparent discrepancy. The newspaper reported her response: . ""Now let me tell you what I can remember, OK -- because what I was told was that we had to land a certain way and move quickly because of the threat of sniper fire. So I misspoke -- I didn't say that in my book or other times but if I said something that made it seem as though there was actual fire -- that's not what I was told,"" she told the newspaper. ""I was told we had to land a certain way, we had to have our bulletproof stuff on because of the threat of sniper fire. I was also told that the greeting ceremony had been moved away from the tarmac but that there was this 8-year-old girl and, I can't, I can't rush by her, I've got to at least greet her -- so I greeted her, I took her stuff and then I left. Now that's my memory of it."" Meanwhile, as Clinton backpedaled from the description of her Bosnia trip, the senator from New York was keeping her focus on the economy with a town hall-style meeting Tuesday in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. Clinton also pushed back against recent speculation by pundits and Democratic insiders that her chances of securing the nomination are quickly diminishing. ""I know there are some in Washington, and some in the media, who want this race to be over,"" she said to a loud chorus of boos. ""There are some who think we don't need to hear the voices of people in Pennsylvania or Indiana or North Carolina or Montana or any of the other states that haven't had their chance to vote. Well, I disagree."" Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, focused on the economy and the housing situation Tuesday, participating in a roundtable discussion in Santa Ana, California.

"U.S. President Barack Obama on Tuesday hailed the achievements of the Nuclear Security Summit here, including some countries' agreements to give their highly enriched uranium to the United States for degrading. ""We've seen such steps as Belgium and Italy completing the removal of their excess supplies of highly enriched uranium and plutonium so that those supplied can be eliminated,"" he said at a joint news conference with Mark Rutte, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands. And dozens of other nations have agreed to take steps to improve nuclear security in their own countries and to support global efforts, the U.S. President said. ""So what's been valuable about this summit is that it has not just been talk, it's been action."" Hours after Obama landed Monday in The Netherlands for the summit, the White House announced a deal to dispose of huge quantities of nuclear material from Japan. Obama credited the heads of state who participated in the effort, ""as well as the extraordinary work of foreign ministers and sherpas and others who have helped to move this process forward."" The United States is doing its part, too, by installing more radiation detection equipment at ports and other transit sites to thwart would-be smugglers of nuclear materials; by developing guidelines to strengthen cybersecurity at nuclear power plants; and by pursuing production of an isotope used in medicine that does not require weapons-usable materials, he said. But more work is to be done ""to fully secure all nuclear and radiological material ... so that it can no longer pose a risk to our citizens,"" he added. ""Given the catastrophic consequences of even a single attack, we cannot be complacent."" He noted that Ukraine agreed at the first such summit, in 2010, to remove its highly enriched uranium from its nuclear fuel sites. ""Had that not happened, those dangerous nuclear materials would still be there now, and the difficult situation we are dealing with in Ukraine today would involve yet another level of concern."" Before the next such summit, to be held in 2016 in Chicago, ""we have to set very clearly what are the actionable items that we've already identified that we know can get done if we have the political will to do them, and let's go ahead and get them done,"" he said. Tuesday's session marked the third such gathering of world leaders since Obama helped launched the initiative in 2009. According to a report issued last year by the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, the United States will spend at least $179 billion over the nine fiscal years of 2010-2018 on its nuclear arsenal.","""It has not just been talk, it has been action,"" Obama says of the nuclear summit .

"(CNN) -- Nelson Mandela's willingness to forgive and forget helped peacefully end an era of white domination in his native South Africa. But as news of his death spread, mourners there and around the world professed that he, himself, would never be forgotten. ""Mandela's biggest legacy ... was his remarkable lack of bitterness and the way he did not only talk about reconciliation, but he made reconciliation happen in South Africa,"" said F.W. de Klerk, South Africa's last white president before giving way to Mandela, the country's first black leader. South Africa's current leader announced late Thursday that, after years suffering from health ailments, the man known widely by his clan name of Madiba died at 8:50 p.m. (1:50 p.m. ET) surrounded by family. He was 95. ""He is now resting. He is now at peace,"" President Jacob Zuma said late Thursday. ""Our nation has lost its greatest son. Our people have lost a father."" Special report: Nelson Mandela . The official SAPA news agency reported early Friday that Mandela's body had been moved to a military hospital in Pretoria. It's expected to be embalmed in the next three to four days, after which there will be a public memorial service at a Johannesburg soccer stadium, according to government sources. Then, his casket will lie in state for several days in Pretoria, and next week -- probably Friday or Saturday -- it will be flown to his ancestral hometown of Qunu for a state funeral and burial, the sources said. Until that funeral, Zuma has ordered flags around South Africa to be ""flown at half-mast,"" something that other countries including the United States and United Kingdom are also doing. The African National Congress -- the political party long associated with Mandela -- said ""our nation has lost a colossus, an epitome of humility, equality, justice, peace and the hope of millions."" ""The large African Baobab, who loved Africa as much as he loved South Africa, has fallen,"" the party said in a statement, comparing Mandela to a sturdy tree found in Africa. ""Its trunk and seeds will nourish the earth for decades to come."" As news spreads, mourners recall 'remarkable man' Throngs -- some of them in pajamas, due to the late hour -- gathered outside Mandela's house in a Johannesburg suburb after word of his death was announced, with people of all races singing, dancing and otherwise paying tribute to the late leader. Some said the news hadn't sunk in yet, while others expressed relief that he died peacefully, according to the official SAPA news agency. ""We must pay tribute to Mandela, the best state leader of all time,"" said 23-year-old Zaid Paruk. Similar scenes broke out elsewhere in the country including Soweto, southwest of Johannesburg, where some celebrated Mandela's life draped in ANC and South African flags. Leon Curling-Hope said she was at a work Christmas party when revelers began singing the national anthem upon hearing the news. ""Everyone is emotional but the messages that are going out are of love and happiness,"" said Curling-Hope, a CNN iReporter. ""Everyone is holding each other singing and talking about the great memories we all have."" Describing him as ""a remarkable man,"" de Klerk told CNN's Christiane Amanpour, ""South Africa, notwithstanding political differences, stands united today, in mourning."" Carrying on the work of Mandela . While the pain resonated most in his homeland, news of Mandela's death echoed worldwide. Moments after Zuma spoke, the U.N. Security Council had a moment of silence in his honor, with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon later calling Mandela ""a giant for justice and a down-to-earth inspiration."" Irish leader Enda Kenny said Mandela's name ""became synonymous with the pursuit of dignity and freedom across the globe."" ""A great light has gone out in the world,"" tweeted British Prime Minister David Cameron. ""Nelson Mandela was a hero of our time."" Reaction from U.S. politicians was similarly swift, with ex-Presidents George H. W. Bush calling Mandela ""a man of tremendous moral courage"" and Bill Clinton remembering him as ""a man of uncommon grace and compassion, for whom abandoning bitterness and embracing adversaries was not just a political strategy but a way of life."" Obama: 'He belongs to the ages' ""We've lost one of the most influential, courageous and profoundly good human beings that any of us will share time with on this earth,"" said current U.S. President Barack Obama, the first black leader of his own country who said his first public activism was an anti-apartheid protest. ""He no longer belongs to us. He belongs to the ages."" Kenyan activist: Mandela saved my life . The immensely popular leader largely stayed out of the public spotlight in recent years due to his medical issues, including a hospitalization for a lung infection in June. On September 1, Mandela was discharged from a Pretoria hospital where he had been receiving treatment since June, according to Zuma's office. He was moved to a home in the Johannesburg suburb of Houghton, where a bedroom was transformed into something akin to an intensive care unit, according to his ex-wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Last month, Madikizela-Mandela told South Africa's Sunday Independent newspaper that tubes used to clear his lungs meant to prevent infections also made it so that he could not speak. She said then that he ""remains quite ill,"" with doctors tending to him regularly. ""He communicates with the face, you see,"" Madikizela-Mandela told the newspaper then. His history of lung problems dates to his days in Robben Island, where he was imprisoned for 27 years as part of his fight to overturn the country's system of racial segregation. Tokyo Sexwale, who was incarcerated a few meters from Mandela, recalled him as ""a very formidable and larger-than-life figure"" who was nonetheless ""very humble"" and loving. ""He was embraced even by white wardens, his own jailers, because he demonstrated that through the power of dialogue ... people on different sides, former enemies can come together,"" Sexwale told CNN. Toiled to dismantle entrenched apartheid . Mandela emerged from prison more prominent than ever and in 1994 -- four years after his release and one year after earning the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk, who was then South Africa's president -- he became South Africa's first black president. Statesman, President, ambassador to the world . Mandela left the presidency in 1999, but remained one of South Africa's most respected and revered international ambassadors, a model for world and particularly African leaders. And a new generation has been introduced to him through movies such as ""Invictus"" and ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom."" The latter film was in the middle of its London premiere when news broke of Mandela's death, though attendees -- Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, among them -- didn't learn about it until producer Anant Singh came onstage as the closing credits ran. He explained that Mandela's daughters had said the premiere should go on; there then was a moment of silence in Oden Cinema. ""It was as if he was born to teach the age a lesson in humility, in humor and above all else in patience,"" said Bono, the U2 singer and Africa activist. ""In the end, Nelson Mandela showed us how to love rather than hate, not because he had never surrendered to rage or violence, but because he learned that love would do a better job."" Hollywood reacts to loss of a legend . His last high-profile public appearance came in 2010, when South Africa hosted soccer's World Cup. His family members and South African officials have updated the public on his life since, including numerous hospitalizations and his eventual return to his . Mandela has been hailed as a pioneer, a statesman, a hero, someone who maintained his easy smile and demeanor after decades of turmoil. To many South Africans, he was known simply, affectionately as Tata -- the word for father in Xhosa tribe. ""What made Nelson Mandela great was precisely what made him human,"" said Zuma.

"(CNN)Molly Norris drew a cartoon four years ago that depicted the likeness of Mohammed on several items, including a tea cup, a thimble and a domino. She received her first death threat within days. One was a fatwa that came from radical and influential cleric Anwar al-Awlaki -- an American-born imam who lived in Yemen -- who said Norris was a ""prime target"" for execution for creating blasphemous cartoons. Norris had kicked off controversy in April 2010 with a cartoon published online about an imaginary group called ""Citizens Against Citizens Against Humor"" that proposed an ""Everybody Draw Mohammed Day."" She disappeared, at the advisement of the FBI, in the fall of that year and has been in hiding since. 'Lighten up' ""She didn't mean to skewer or offend. She just thought people should lighten up,"" her friend Tim Appelo said. ""She was just standing up for free speech. But in a very gentle way."" At the time, Norris told a Seattle magazine that the consequences of the drawing were unintended. ""I didn't mean for my satirical poster to be taken seriously. It became kind of an excuse for people to hate or be mean-spirited. I'm not mean-spirited,"" Norris told City Arts Magazine. Norris said in media interviews at the time that she was inspired by the furor created from an episode of the show ""South Park"" that depicted Mohammed dressed in a bear suit. Comedy Central, which airs ""South Park,"" aired an edited version of the episode after the show's creators received threats. Why Islam forbids images of Mohammed . Internet vulgarity . Norris' cartoon inspired others to launch a campaign to create pictures of the Islamic prophet across the Internet. More than 100,000 people signed up on a Facebook page. A Pakistani court ordered access to Facebook there cut off for two weeks. Competing sites that blasted the campaign also drew tens of thousands of followers. ""When she learned about the Facebook page that had the most vulgar cartoons you can imagine, she distanced herself immediately,"" Arsalan Bukhari, the executive director for the Washington chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""She realized this is the wrong thing to do, to deliberately insult a minority group."" Norris made a short film about the experiences of American Muslim women who wear head scarves. She was trying to destroy stereotypes about Muslim women, he said. It was too late and the death threats too many. She changed her identity and went into hiding. Muslims' mixed response to new Mohammed cover . FBI's dilemma . The threat posed a challenge to the FBI, retired agent David Gomez told CNN's Don Lemon. Gomez was once in charge of Norris' case. His regional office told FBI leadership in Washington they thought they needed to protect Norris to avoid her becoming the first U.S. citizen victimized by Islamist extremists for exercising her right to free speech. ""Of course, it came back and said 'absolutely,'"" he said. Whether or not to go into hiding was her choice, he said. ""She wasn't forced. She was given the option,"" Gomez said. He and his colleagues believed back then that the threats were credible. ""Now, four and a half years later the credibility of that threat has been shown,"" he said. The attack on the cartoonists at Charlie Hebdo in Paris has boosted the danger to people on terrorists' kill lists. He hopes Norris is keeping an extra low profile right now. ""There is an argument to be made that increased publicity increases her risk. I don't know what can be done to avoid that,"" he said. Like cancer . One of her employers, the Seattle Weekly, wrote this when it announced she was leaving: ""She likens the situation to cancer. It might basically be nothing, it might be urgent and serious, it might go away and never return, or it might pop up again when she least expects it. We're hoping the religious bigots go into full and immediate remission, and we wish her the best."" Unfortunately, Tom Fuentes, a former FBI agent and a CNN analyst, said it means leaving everything -- family, friends, job, home -- behind and likely never coming back. Al-Awlaki was killed by a drone strike in Yemen in 2011 but the threats against her remain. Recently, Norris' name popped up on al Qaeda's most wanted list in the jihadist magazine, Inspire. The list also included Charlie Hebdo's editor, Stéphane Charbonnier, gunned down along with 11 others last week in Paris. ""A chill ran down my spine because I saw her name on a list of ""A Bullet a Day Keeps the Infidel Away"" and it was horrible,"" Appelo said. ""I'm sure she felt the chill too."" 7 questions being asked about Islam .

"In Germany, high tech has come to airport parking. Last week, Düsseldorf airport (DUS) introduced robot valets to take the hassle out of parking for travelers. SEE ALSO: 13 Robots Who Don't Know How to Robot . Travelers can leave their cars at the arrival level of the ParkingPLUS structure. As they leave, they confirm on a touch-screen that no one is in the car. The robot valet, nicknamed ""Ray,"" takes it from there. The robot measures the vehicle, picks it up with a forklift-like system, and takes it to the back area, where it will position it in one of the 249 parking spots reserved for automated valets. The machine is capable of carrying standard cars weighing up to 3.31 tons. The robot valet is even connected to the airport's flight data system, and by checking customer trip data with the database, Ray knows when the customer will return for the vehicle. A traveler can note any itinerary changes in a parking app, which is available for iOS and Android. Düsseldorf's airport is relatively small, and officials touted the convenience of heading to the terminal from the parking structure entrance. Ray ""makes the distances between planes and passengers' vehicles even shorter,"" according to a statement from the airport. ""Our product is especially appealing to business travelers, who arrive at the airport shortly before the flight, seek efficient parking, and return within a few days,"" said Thomas Schnalke, the airport's managing director. The introductory rate for robot valet parking at Düsseldorf is 29 euros ($39.59) per day or 4 euros ($5.46) per hour. Although the airport is targeting business travelers in a hurry, the service is open to anyone. If airport customers use the robot valet, airport officials said they would consider expanding the system. Ray was produced by Serva Transport in the Bavarian town of Grabenstätt. Serva previewed the robot valet in 2013; Düsseldorf is the first installation of the system.","A German airport has introduced robot valets .

"Fifty-five years after Maria Ridulph vanished from a small-town street corner while playing in the snow, a former neighbor was sentenced to life in prison for kidnapping and killing the brown-eyed second-grader. Jack Daniel McCullough, who was 17 and known as John Tessier back in 1957, was finally identified two years ago by Maria's childhood companion as ""Johnny,"" the blond man with the ducktail haircut who offered the girls piggyback rides and carried Maria off into oblivion. McCullough, who worked as a police officer for a time in Washington state, was convicted of child abduction and murder after a two-week trial in September. He continues to assert his innocence. In court Monday, McCullough claimed he was framed by corrupt police and prosecutors. He pointed at a white box on the defense table that he said contained 4,000 pages of FBI reports from 1957. He said agents interviewed 1,800 people and cleared him. And then, his hand still resting on the box, he urged the judge, ""Your honor, in the name of justice and fairness, open the box and view the truth."" Judge James Hallock had ruled the documents inadmissible at McCullough's trial. The case is believed by investigators to be the oldest cold case to go to trial and result in a conviction. McCullough was sentenced under laws that were in effect in 1957. Suspect in 1957 cold case charged as fugitive . After the 90-minute hearing, snowflakes fell on Ridulph's brother, Charles, and sister, Patricia Quinn, as they stood on the courthouse steps and said they were relieved Maria had finally received justice. ""This has been a nightmare for our family,"" Charles Ridulph said. Quinn added that the crime ""changed Sycamore. People were afraid."" McCullough, now 73, was questioned during the first days of the investigation but was never considered a suspect because he seemed to have the perfect alibi: He and his parents said he was miles away in Rockford, enlisting in the Air Force and taking a physical. He left Sycamore days after Maria's disappearance and served in the Air Force and then the Army. He was stationed for a time in Vietnam, rose to the rank of captain and was awarded the Bronze star for bravery in combat, his lawyer said. The murder case went cold, but Sycamore never forgot about Maria Ridulph. On the 40th anniversary of her disappearance, a monument was erected outside Sycamore's police station. It says, in part: ""This is in memory of Maria Ridulph who on December 3, 1957, was kidnapped while playing near her home. She was found murdered in the spring of 1958. This also is in honor of the great people in our community that reached out in love and compassion."" McCullough's youngest sister, a baby at the time of the crime, contacted an Illinois State Police tip line in 2008 and told investigators that her dying mother had pulled her close in her hospital room years earlier and, referring to Ridulph's murder, said, ""John did it. John did it, and you have to tell someone."" Janet Tessier added that her mother was agitated and emotional at the time and ""expressed a great deal of guilt,"" according to a transcript obtained by CNN. After state police reopened the case, they interviewed a former girlfriend in Florida and eventually poked holes in McCullough's alibi. A government-issued train ticket fell out of the back of a photograph the woman mailed to police, and an expert authenticated the ticket and said it had not been used. Kathy Sigman Chapman, who was playing with Maria the night she was abducted, picked that photo of McCullough out of a police lineup in September 2010. Although she had viewed hundreds, if not thousands, of photos before, it was the first time she'd been able to identify ""Johnny."" She testified that she was certain she had identified the right man. Illinois girl's body exhumed in 1957 slaying . The girls had been excited as the first snowflakes of the season fell on the evening of December 3, 1957, Chapman recalled. They asked to go back outside after dinner. The Tessier family lived around the corner and two blocks down Center Cross Street from Archie Place, where the girls' families lived. Because he was older, Maria and Kathy did not know John Tessier, a high school dropout. ""Johnny"" asked the girls if they liked dolls and if they'd like to ride in a truck, bus or train. Maria ran home and returned with a favorite doll. Then Chapman left Maria alone with Johnny and went home to fetch her mittens. When she came back, they were both gone. She alerted Maria's brother, Charles. A massive search began, which continued throughout December. Maria's doll was found by a neighbor's garage. The missing child case drew dozens of FBI agents to this small farming community about 60 miles west of Chicago. FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover demanded daily updates, which were shared with President Dwight Eisenhower. The disappearance of the 7-year-old with the perfect Sunday school attendance was national news for a while as 1,000 volunteers scoured fields of corn stubble for clues. Maria's remains were found in the spring by a retired couple looking for mushrooms under the melting snow. She was 120 miles from home, in a field near the town of Galena and not far from a river campground where the Tessier family spent vacations.","Man sentenced to life in 1957 kidnapping and murder of 7-year-old girl .

"PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago (CNN) -- President Obama said Friday he is seeking ""a new beginning"" in U.S. relations with Cuba. President Obama and Venezuela President Hugo Chavez greet each other Friday at the Summit of the Americas. Before addressing the representatives of 34 countries at the Summit of the Americas, Obama and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez saw each other and shook hands. ""Every one of our nations has a right to follow its own path,"" Obama told the assembly. ""But we all have a responsibility to see that the people of the Americas have the ability to pursue their own dreams in democratic societies. ""Toward that end, the United States seeks a new beginning with Cuba."" Obama arrived in Trinidad and Tobago on Friday evening for the Summit of the Americas, a key meeting of hemispheric powers. Although it was not represented at the talks, the subject of Cuba dominated the president's speech. In prepared remarks, Obama said that ""decades of mistrust"" must be overcome, but noted that he has already loosened restrictions that limited Americans from traveling to visit relatives in Cuba and from sending money to them. Obama lifted all restrictions Monday on the ability of individuals to visit relatives in Cuba, as well as to send them remittances. That may be just the beginning. ""I am prepared to have my administration engage with the Cuban government on a wide range of issues -- from human rights, free speech and democratic reform to drugs, migration and economic issues,"" he said. ""Let me be clear: I am not interested in talking for the sake of talking. But I do believe that we can move U.S.-Cuban relations in a new direction."" Obama's comments represent a significant shift in a U.S. policy that has remained largely unchanged since 1962, when the U.S. government imposed a trade embargo with Havana. They come a day after Cuban President Raul Castro said he was prepared to discuss ""everything, everything, everything"" with the United States. Castro told a summit of leftist Latin American leaders gathered in Venezuela, ""We are prepared, wherever they want, to discuss everything -- human rights, freedom of the press, political prisoners,"" Castro said Thursday. Havana played a major role in Obama's remarks, where he called for rejection of ""stale debates"" that have undermined opportunities to forge new partnerships.  Watch Obama speak about ""a new day"" » . ""They would have us make the false choice between a rigid, state-run economy and unbridled and unregulated capitalism; between blame for right-wing paramilitaries or left-wing insurgents; between sticking to inflexible policies with regard to Cuba or denying the full human rights that are owed to the Cuban people. ""I didn't come here to debate the past -- I came here to deal with the future. As neighbors, we have a responsibility to each other and to our citizens. And by working together, we can take important steps forward to advance prosperity, security and liberty."" Chavez's press office said Obama walked up to Chavez to greet him, a meeting it called ""historic."" ""President Chavez expressed his hope that relations between the two countries would change,"" the press office said, quoting Chavez as having told his U.S. counterpart, ""Eight years ago with this same hand I greeted Bush. I want to be your friend."" It said Obama then thanked Chavez. Chavez once referred to former President Bush as ""the devil."" On other matters, Obama, who said he is committed to fighting inequality ""and creating prosperity from the bottom up,"" announced a Microfinance Growth Fund for the hemisphere and proposed creating an Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas ""to promote renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions."" He also vowed to ""take aggressive action"" to slash demand for illegal drugs, and to halt the movement of arms and money to Mexico. Obama's push for a rapprochement with Havana is supported by most Americans, 71 percent of whom said they favor re-establishing diplomatic relations, according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll carried out April 3-5. The poll had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.","President Obama says ""decades of mistrust"" must be overcome .

"(CNN) -- Aid organizations have deployed emergency response teams to Haiti and appealed for donations after the Caribbean nation was was struck by a devastating earthquake described by local officials as a ""catastrophe of major proportions."" The magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck southern Haiti on Tuesday, knocking down buildings and inflicting a new catastrophe on the western hemisphere's poorest nation. Humanitarian charity Oxfam said Wednesday it was rushing rescue teams to the country from around the region to provide clean water, sanitation, shelter and emergency supplies and called for donations to fund its efforts. Impact Your World: How you can help . ""At this stage it is too early to tell the severity of the earthquake in Haiti, but the early signs are not good with communications down across the country,"" said Jane Cocking, humanitarian director of Oxfam. Kristie van de Wetering, a former Oxfam employee based in the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, said the situation in the capital was ""very chaotic"" with many buildings reduced to rubble. ""We can hear people calling for help from every corner. The aftershocks are ongoing and making people very nervous,"" she said. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said volunteers in Haiti were assisting the injured and supporting hospitals which had been overwhelmed by the disaster. It said it had enough supplies in Haiti for 3,000 families. Experts in disaster response are due to arrive in the country later Wednesday to coordinate international relief efforts, it said. ""The most urgent needs at this time are search and rescue, field hospitals, emergency health, water purification, emergency shelter, logistics and telecommunications,"" the group said in a statement. The quake struck about 15 km (10 miles) southwest of Port-au-Prince shortly before 5 p.m. local time, cutting off communications across much of the country. ""Port-au-Prince is devastated, lot of deaths. SOS. SOS...,"" wrote Louise Ivers, the clinical director of medical charity Partners In Health, in an e-mail to the group's offices in Boston, Massachusetts. She added: ""Temporary field hospital ... needs supplies, pain meds, bandages. Please help us."" Raymond Joseph, Haiti's ambassador to the U.S., told CNN's Wolf Blitzer by telephone that the country was going throug . ""I'm calling on all friends of Haiti and people who are listening to me to please come to our aid,"" said Raymond Joseph, Haiti's ambassador to the U.S. told CNN's Wolf Blitzer by telephone. ""Today as Haiti is going through the worst day in its history I am calling for all others who got help from us in the beginning to help in support,"" Joseph said. ""The only thing I can do now is pray and hope for the best."" Singer Wyclef Jean, nephew of ambassador Joseph, stressed the need for help for what is considered among the poorest nations in the Western Hemisphere. ""We're going to need immediate aid,"" Jean told Blitzer on CNN. ""We're going to need the United States and the international community to react immediately."" He founded Yele Haiti, whose community service programs include food distribution and emergency relief. In Washington U.S. President Barack Obama said the government would ""stand ready to assist the people of Haiti."" At the Pentagon, the U.S. military said humanitarian aid was being prepared for shipping, but it was not yet clear where or how it would be sent. A U.S. aviation source said the control tower at the Port-au-Prince international airport collapsed, possibly hindering efforts to fly relief supplies into the country. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters that Washington is offering ""our full assistance"" to Haiti. ""And our prayers are with the people who have suffered, their families and their loved ones,"" she said. The deputy chief of the U.S. mission in Haiti, David Lindwall, told Clinton that he saw ""significant damage"" from the quake and said U.S. officials there expect ""serious loss of life,"" Crowley said. And Clinton's husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton -- now the U.N. special envoy for Haiti -- said the world body was ""committed to do whatever we can to assist the people of Haiti in their relief, rebuilding and recovery efforts."" Haiti's government is backed by a U.N. peacekeeping mission established after the ouster of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 2004. The United States has been heavily involved in Haiti commercially, politically and militarily for most of the last century. U.S. intervention under Clinton restored Aristide to power in 1994 after a 1991 coup, and a U.S. jet hustled him out of the country again in 2004 following a rapidly spreading uprising against his government. With people stripping the trees for fuel and to clear land for agriculture, the mountainous countryside has been heavily deforested. That has led to severe erosion and left Haitians vulnerable to massive landslides when heavy rains fall. Roads in Haiti were unsafe to travel on because of a lack of lighting and because many buildings along transportation routes had collapsed or were not deemed safe, said Ian Rodgers of the relief organization Save the Children. ""What I can hear is very distressed people,"" Rogers said. ""There is a lot of distress and wailing of people trying to find loved ones."" A representative for the aid group Catholic Relief Services in Haiti described the situation in the nation as ""a total disaster,"" said Robyn Fieser, regional information officer for the group. Haiti's dense population will increase the risk to its people, Jean said. The nation's need for aid will range from water and food to medical and building supplies. ""This is the worst devastation that we as Haitian people have faced,"" he said. Hurricane Gordon killed more than 1,000 people in 1994, while Hurricane Georges killed more than 400 and destroyed the majority of the country's crops in 1998. And in 2004, Hurricane Jeanne killed more than 3,000 people even as it passed north of Haiti, with most of the deaths in the northwestern city of Gonaives. Gonaives was hit heavily again in 2008 when four tropical systems passed through. According to the U.N. Office for the Special Envoy for Haiti, unemployment reaches 70 percent nationally, and 78 percent of Haitians live on less than $2 a day.

"Bolivian officials say their country's presidential plane had to land in Austria on Tuesday after false rumors circulated that former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden was aboard the aircraft. Portuguese authorities wouldn't let President Evo Morales' plane land for refueling in Lisbon, Bolivian Defense Minister Ruben Saavedra told CNN en Español. French authorities also wouldn't let the plane enter their airspace, he said. ""We are told that there were some unfounded suspicions that Mr. Snowden was on the plane,"" Bolivian Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca said. ""We do not know who has invented this lie. Someone who wants to harm our country. This information that has been circulated is malicious information to harm this country."" In a televised address late Tuesday night, Bolivian Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera described Morales as a ""hostage of imperialism."" ""The president has been kidnapped by imperialism, and he is being held in Europe,"" he said, calling for workers worldwide to protest ""this act of imperial arrogance."" The situation is the latest twist in what has become a global guessing game over Snowden's next steps. Snowden has admitted leaking classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs and faces espionage charges in the United States. He has applied for asylum in 21 countries, including Bolivia. Morales, a left-leaning president who has long criticized the United States, had been attending a conference of gas-exporting countries in Russia, where he told the Russia Today news network that he would be willing to consider asylum for Snowden. But Bolivian officials stressed that accusations that an official aircraft would harbor Snowden were baseless. ""We cannot lie to the international community by carrying ghost passengers,"" Choquehuanca said. Garcia Linera said that since the plane's landing in Austria, some European officials have said they would let the plane fly over their airspace only if investigators are allowed to search it -- a condition which the vice president called unacceptable. ""We are not going to accept blackmail or any type of conditions,"" he said. Protesters waving Bolivian flags crowded outside the French Embassy in La Paz Tuesday night, calling for the embassy to be booted from the South American country, state-run Bolivia TV reported. Snowden's asylum options dwindle . Bolivian defense minister: U.S. government was behind Snowden rumor . Choquehuanca said authorities from the South American country are investigating the source of the false rumors about Snowden. Saavedra told CNN en Español that he believed the U.S. government was behind the rumors. ""This is a lie, a falsehood,"" he said. ""It was generated by the U.S. government."" Bolivia's air travel rights were violated, he said. ""It is an outrage. It is an abuse. It is a violation of the conventions and agreements of international air transportation,"" he said. The plane had been flying from Moscow back to Bolivia. The original flight plan had a refueling stop scheduled in Lisbon, said Saavedra, who is traveling with Morales. Once Portuguese authorities told them they couldn't land there for ""technical reasons,"" the crew changed course for the Canary Islands, the defense minister said. Right before the plane was about to fly over the French border, authorities there said they couldn't enter the country's airspace, again citing ""technical issues,"" according to Saavedra. ""The crew informed us of this situation ... and out of caution they suggested we turn back and land at the airport in Vienna, which we did,"" Saavedra said. Bolivia's foreign minister told reporters that the move had put the president's life at risk. ""Portugal owes us an explanation. France owes us an explanation,"" Choquehuanca said. 'Unbowed' Snowden seeks new havens . Bolivia's allies react . The situation drew a swift rebuke from Ecuador's foreign minister, who told reporters he planned to call a regional meeting of the Union of South American Nations, known as UNASUR, to discuss it. ""We consider this a huge offense, and I will call for a UNASUR special summit with foreign secretaries to discuss this issue,"" Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said. Cuba's Foreign Ministry released a statement condemning the incident. ""This constitutes an unacceptable, unfounded and arbitrary act which offends all of Latin America and the Caribbean,"" the statement said. A history of tense relations . It isn't the first time Bolivian authorities have accused U.S. officials of trying to meddle with their presidential plane. In 2011, Morales said he was worried that U.S. authorities would plant something on his presidential plane to link him with drug trafficking when he attended a United Nations General Assembly meeting. ""I think they have to be preparing something,"" he told a convention of female farm workers. ""So much that I'm afraid to go with our airplane to the United States."" Bolivia and the United States have had diminished relations since September 2008, when each country expelled the other's ambassador. Morales, a strong proponent of the cultivation of coca plants -- the source of cocaine -- expelled the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration a month later. He also delivered a strong verbal criticism of the U.S. government at the United Nations General Assembly that year. In May, Morales said he was expelling the U.S. Agency for International Development from his country for allegedly meddling and conspiring against the government. The U.S. State Department denied the accusation, called the decision regrettable and said the ones who will be hurt by the expulsion will be ordinary Bolivians.","Bolivian VP: President Evo Morales is a ""hostage of imperialism""

"Jacmel, Haiti (CNN) -- Much was lost in the town of Jacmel, Haiti's cultural center. The nation's only film school has lost two buildings. The huge, colorful paper mache floats for Carnival, just 10 days away, are crushed. The mountains of sheet music for the classes at Ecole Musique are scattered in the rubble of a street named La Berenthe, the labyrinth. It's estimated 10 percent of the town's residents have perished. And with them they took a country's film festival, its music studios, the paintings and masks that draw tourists and Haitians to this seaside town of 40,000. Left behind are crushed limbs and brain injuries, nursed in an open-air hospital that replaced the real one. Cuban doctors had been working with Haitians when the earthquake hit, and they have continued their collaboration outside. ""Where there is life, there is hope,"" says Dr. Silda Del Torro of Cuba while standing over a 4-year-old girl who has drifted in and out of consciousness. iReport: Looking for loved ones . Del Torro says the head injuries are very hard to treat under these conditions, and she worries they will be left with crippling injuries, or worse. The doctors working in the open air also fear they have reached the limits of their abilities. They aren't orthopedists or anesthesiologists, and some patients with crushed limbs are developing gangrene. There are surgeries that need to be done. This seaside town is just over an hour's drive from the epicenter of the earthquake. It has an airport and a port that bring in tourists. But much of the growing international relief effort has been focused on Port-au-Prince until now. The residents dug out trapped neighbors largely on their own for days. But intrepid Jacmel residents got out word they needed help through the Internet, texts, Facebook and YouTube. Latest updates | Twitter | Full coverage . The Cine Institute was left homeless, but its young filmmakers pulled their equipment from the rocks and moved into a building next to the airport. They set up generators, powered up laptops and started moving visual images across oceans in a cry for help. ""We just got the information out. Our filmmakers just went out and started shooting and sent it away even as their own families were being affected, their homes being lost,"" said David Belle, institute director. Their plea was heard, and Colombia rescue workers arrived just in time to pull a child from the rubble. The Chileans sent doctors. Sri Lanka sent security. The French assembled a clinic where parents had dug for a trapped child unsuccessfully for days. Canada brought in the big guns -- a Navy ship and Army helicopter with engineers and supplies. Impact Your World . ""We brought in light engineering equipment, drills, the jaws of life, anything that can be carried portably,"" said Robert Brown, a naval commander from Halifax, Canada. The United States joined the effort Tuesday, announcing they will fly in C130s with supplies that will assist the Canadians in making Jacmel's airport the center of the rescue efforts to southern provinces not touched by the aid sent to Port-au-Prince. High-resolution images of damage . But this town needs so much more than just immediate relief. The days without aid wore down their psyche and hampered relief efforts.

"(CNN) -- It's Ibrahim Hamadto's turn to serve. Holding the bat in his mouth, the Egyptian para-table tennis champion gets the rally going by flicking the ball up high with his right foot. Sinking through the air, the delicate white sphere meets his racket and comes out charging like a bullet with a powerful spin. Hamadto, 41, is armless. He lost both his upper limbs in a train accident when he was just 10 years old. But the terrible misfortune didn't stop him from pushing himself to follow his dreams. ""In our village, we could only play, at that time, table tennis and soccer -- that's why I played both,"" Hamadto, who hails from Kafr Saad in northeastern Egypt, told CNN. ""It was logic to play soccer first due to my case; then I played table tennis as a challenge."" Starting at 13, Hamadto spent years working hard to perfect his game -- initially he tried different options at gripping the bat, including holding it under his armpit, before deciding to handle it with his mouth. ""It was quite difficult playing table tennis after the accident,"" Hamadto recalled. ""I had to practice hard for three consecutive years on a daily basis. At the beginning, people were amazed and surprised seeing me playing. They encouraged and supported me a lot and they were very proud of my willing, perseverance and determination."" People were also very proud of his athletic achievements. Hamadto, who is married and a father of three, has won several honors over the years, including the silver medal in the African Para-Table Tennis Championships last year. Earlier this month, the Egyptian champion demonstrated his skills at the World Team Table Tennis Championships, held in Tokyo, Japan, where he was the guest of honor and played against some of the sport's biggest names. ""Ibrahim is a very nice man with faith and perseverance,"" said Alaa Meshref, the president of Egyptian Table Tennis Federation. ""He is very polite and modest. Although his circumstances, both financially and physically, are not that easy going, he never asked for anything,"" he added, going on to describe Hamadto as a role model for every young person. ""People without disabilities should learn more from him, as they always find excuses for minimal nuisances. They need to understand how he was able to conquer his tragedy and prove that insisting on your goal is always achievable."" Indeed, watching Hamadto playing, seeing the artistry in his game as he defends with panache and attacks with vigor, it's hard to disagree. ""I believe that nothing is impossible, as long as you work hard,"" said Hamadto. ""This is the message I would like to send to people."" Read more: Kenya's cycling hero .

"Hamas and Israel blamed one another for the lack of a cease-fire in a conflict that has left more than 1,200 people dead, raising questions about just what it will take to end the fighting in Gaza. The violence continued Wednesday morning, when Israeli forces shelled the Abu Hussein School in northern Gaza and killed at least 20 people, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. The Israeli military said they are looking into the incident. International efforts to broker a deal to end the violence failed again Tuesday, with Hamas rejecting a cease-fire proposal put forward by the Palestinian Authority that called for a 24-hour truce that could be extended to 72 hours. Hamas maintains that any deal must include an end to Israel's blockade of Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said any truce must allow for its protection against tunnels used by Palestinian militants in Gaza to make their way into Israel. ""Hamas is responsible for all deaths on their side and on our side because they are the ones who kept this conflict going,"" Mark Regev, a spokesman for Netanyahu, told CNN. ""People are fighting and people are dying because Hamas said no to a cease-fire."" Israel is ""ready for a period of sustained peace and security"" Regev said earlier in the day on CNN. But he asserted that Hamas has consistently rejected truces and an Egyptian initiative for a cease-fire put forth this month. On Hamas-run television, Mohammed Deif, chief of the group's military wing, said that ""there is no middle ground"" regarding a truce until Israel ends its ""siege"" of Gaza. ""The Israeli enemy will not have security as long as we don't have security for our people,"" he said. Hamas wants Israel to lift a blockade it began on Gaza in 2007, a move Israel has said was necessary to stop Hamas and other allied militant group from bringing weapons into Gaza. But Israel has been under fire for sealing the borders, with aid groups saying the blockade has cut off basic supplies and created a humanitarian crisis. Deaths mount as fighting rages . While leaders continued to talk, the lights in Gaza flickered on and off in many homes after its only power plant was hit. Palestinian officials blamed an Israeli airstrike. But Israel said the power plant was not a target. At least 40% of Gaza's fuel had been burned by early Tuesday, according to Fathi al-Sheikh Khalil, deputy chairman of the Palestinian Energy Natural Resources Authority in Gaza. The plant will have to be reconstructed and will not operate as it did for at least a year, he said. ""We cannot supply electricity"" for hospitals, sewage treatment or domestic use, he said. ""This is a disaster."" Hamas-run television reported early Tuesday that Israeli strikes hit the Ministry of Finance in western Gaza and the house of Ismail Haniyeh, a senior political leader of Hamas. A radio station run by Hamas was bombed. At least 1,242 people in Gaza have died and more than 7,000 have been wounded since the conflict between Israel and Hamas began, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza said. The number of militants killed is unclear, but the United Nations estimates that 70% to 80% of the dead are civilians. Fifty-three Israeli soldiers have died since Operation Protective Edge began July 8, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Three civilians have been killed in Israel as well. 'Underlying kinds of issues' In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry defended the Obama administration's efforts to seek a cease-fire and sloughed off strong Israeli public criticism of his initiative. He also said Netanyahu ""consistently said he would embrace a cease-fire that permits Israel to protect itself against the tunnels"" used by Palestinian militants in Gaza. ""We are working very carefully, and I think thoughtfully, with our Israeli friends in order to be able to find a way to reduce the civilian loss of life, to prevent this from spiraling downwards into a place from which, you know, both sides have difficulty finding a way forward in order to address the underlying kinds of issues,"" Kerry said. The official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported that Palestinian leadership in the West Bank was offering a 24-hour truce, which could be extended to 72 hours, and that the idea had support from Hamas and Islamic Jihad, another militant group in Gaza. But Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spokesman in Gaza, said the WAFA report was not true and ""not related to the resistance,"" which ""speaks for itself."" When Hamas gets a guarantee from Israel for ""international mediation regarding a humanitarian pause, then we can consider it,"" he said on Hamas TV. Israel repeatedly has condemned Hamas for rejecting an Egyptian proposal for a cease-fire that Israel agreed to earlier this month. Some temporary cease-fires have taken place throughout the conflict, with each side quickly accusing the other of violating the pauses in shooting. Refugee camp hit, 'terror sites' targeted . The Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza was shelled Tuesday, Hamas said. A medical official said more than 10 people were killed. ""Witnesses have told paramedics that entire families are still buried under the rubble,"" said al-Qidra, the spokesman for the Gaza Health Ministry. Meanwhile, Israel reported that five people were seen emerging from a tunnel shaft in Gaza. They fired at Israeli troops, who ""responded and engaged the perpetrators,"" the IDF said. ""In addition, forces uncovered ammunition which included AK-47 assault rifles, machine guns and explosive devices. Since midnight, the IDF targeted over 110 terror sites."" Israel has uncovered 32 tunnels used by Hamas to smuggle weapons and launch attacks, Israel Defense Forces said. Hamas has an estimated 10,000 rockets, more than a quarter of which have been fired into Israel in the past few weeks, the IDF said. A cache of rockets was discovered at a U.N.-operated school in central Gaza that was closed for the summer, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. The school was not being used as a shelter, it said. The rockets were discovered Tuesday during a regular UNRWA inspection, the agency said. It's the third time the rockets have been discovered at a closed school in Gaza. ""Because of fighting in the vicinity of the school we have been unable to get a U.N. munitions expert to the school, but we hope to do as soon as the security conditions allow,"" Chris Gunness of the UNRWA said.

"An audio recording purportedly from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria promises more fighting in more Iraqi cities, including Baghdad. ""Continue your march as the battle is not yet raging,"" a voice said to be that of ISIS spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani says on the message posted early Thursday (last Wednesday night ET)  on the group's media website. ""It will rage in Baghdad and Karbala. So be ready for it."" CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the audio or time and date of its recording, which is nearly 17 minutes long. ""Don't give up a hand's width of  ground you've liberated,"" the voice says in apparent encouragement of ISIS fighters. The message, if authentic, is further proof that the militant group are not content with control of the places they have already taken over -- and are setting their sights higher. Open to U.S. strikes . On Wednesday, Iraq's government indicated a willingness for the United States military to conduct airstrikes against the radical Islamist militants. Several U.S. officials said Washington views the situation as ""extremely urgent"" and is looking to see what more support the United States can provide to the Iraqi government, in addition to weapons and vehicles it has already provided. Part of this will be giving Iraqi officals intelligence they can use to go going after ISIS. Assistance could also involve training and ""kinetic"" activity, U.S. officials told CNN, but they wouldn't specify whether those options included airstrikes. Baghdad's openness to airstrikes was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday night. One of the officials said there clearly was a breakdown in Iraqi security, but Washington believes it was a combination of factors, including the fact that Iraqi forces were already stretched thin by limited success against ISIS in Anbar province. Government forces in the northern cities of Mosul and Tikrit ran when attacked this week, the officials said. One silver lining, the officials said, is that Iraqi officials now seem to have a coordinated approach with the semiautonomous Kurdish regional government. It appears Iraqi forces will team up with Kurdish fighters, known as the Peshmerga, to fight militants with ISIS, an offshoot of al Qaeda. Peshmerga forces took up positions in southwest Kirkuk after militants took over several villages and districts north and west of the city and the Iraqi army withdrew, police officials there told CNN. The U.S. State Department on Wednesday updated its travel warning to Iraq, saying terrorist activity and violence is at ""levels unseen since 2007."" It has warned against all but essential travel to the country. Rapid takeovers . A day after taking over Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, ISIS militants gained nearly complete control of the northern city of Tikrit, witnesses in the city and police officials in neighboring Samarra told CNN. Heavy fighting erupted inside Tikrit -- the hometown of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein -- as the military tried to regain control, the sources and a police official in Baghdad said. According to the witnesses in Tikrit and the Samarra police officials, two police stations in Tikrit were on fire and a military base was taken over by militants. The governor of Salaheddin province, of which Tikrit is the capital, was missing, according to the sources. Suspected ISIS militants raided the Turkish Consulate in Mosul on Wednesday, capturing 48 people, including diplomats, and they also seized parts of Baiji, the site of Iraq's largest oil refinery, police officials in Tikrit told CNN. The devastating ISIS advance is proving an object lesson of much that is wrong in Iraq and the region -- with a festering civil war over the border in Syria adding fuel to the growing sectarian tensions at home. ISIS is exploiting this to expand its influence, from cities like Falluja and parts of Ramadi that it wrested from the government in Anbar early this year, and from Syrian towns like Raqqa it controls over the border. That it is capable of fighting the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on one hand, its fellow radicals on another and the Iraqi government on top of that is an indication of the depth to which ISIS has established itself in the region. Militants were responsible for the deaths of many U.S. troops in western Iraq. With American help, Iraqi tribal militias put ISIS on the defensive. But when U.S. troops left the country, the extremist militants found new leadership, grew stronger while in Syria, and returned to Iraq, making military gains often off the backs of foreign fighters drawn to Syria's conflict. Half million civilians displaced . The clashes across Iraq come on the heels of a sudden and danger-fraught exodus from the fighting in Mosul, which fell to militants Tuesday. More than 500,000 people have fled the fighting there, the International Organization for Migration said Wednesday. The group said there were many civilian casualties. The city's four main hospitals are inaccessible because of fighting, and some mosques have been converted for use as clinics, the IOM said. Those fleeing the fighting -- some on foot, some bringing only what they can carry in plastic bags -- were heading to the city's east or seeking sanctuary elsewhere in Nineveh province or in Iraq's Kurdish region. The U.N. Refugee Agency said many people were traveling with no belongings and little or no money. That including one family of 12 people, including a 70-year-old grandmother, who had walked for two days from a farm near Mosul to a checkpoint. They had no idea what they were going to do next, and they had spent all their cash, the United Nations said. Mosul, a predominantly Sunni city with 1.6 million residents, collapsed swiftly. American-trained Iraqi forces ran in the face of the onslaught, leaving behind uniforms, weapons and armored vehicles. A U.S. Department of Defense official said Washington has provided $15 billion in training, weapons and equipment to the Iraqi government. The heavily armed radicals overran police stations, freed more than 1,000 prisoners from the city jail and took over the city's international airport. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki ordered that all military leaders who fled be court-martialed. The Defense Ministry said the air force killed a group of ISIS militants along a highway leading south toward Samarra. The ministry also said it would push back the militants. ""This is not the end, we are very confident that we will be able to correct the path and to overcome mistakes,"" the ministry said on its website. The Interior Ministry said that military commanders have started deploying fighters from local Shiite militias on the western outskirts of al-Nasiriya to protect that city. Turkish consulate targeted . Turkish special forces members, consulate workers and three children were among those detained and taken to the ISIS headquarters following a raid on the Turkish Consulate in Mosul on Wednesday morning, Turkish officials told CNN. ""The condition of the Turkish citizens is fine, developments are being monitored,"" the officials said. Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said consulate staff had been urged to leave this week, but the decision to evacuate was left up to individuals. ""We were told that it would be more risky for our 48 people to go outside than to stay inside,"" Davutoglu said, speaking on Turkish television. ""If any harm is done to any of our citizens, it will not go unanswered. No one should test Turkey."" Oil town under attack . Meanwhile, suspected ISIS militants seized parts of Baiji, a small Iraqi town in Salaheddin province about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the capital, Baghdad, police officials in Tikrit told CNN. The Baiji oil refinery is still under the control of Iraqi security forces, officials said. The fact that ISIS forces are trying to take the town suggests a wider strategic aim besides oil. Baiji sits on the main highway north from Baghdad to Mosul that passes through rural areas in which ISIS has much influence. For the government to reinforce its troops in Mosul, it needs to drive them through Baiji. If ISIS controls the town, the government's task will be much harder. Explosions struck three Shiite areas in Baghdad, killing 25 people and injuring 56, police officials told CNN. The deadliest attack was in Sadr City, where a car bomb exploded near a funeral tent, killing 15 people, police said. Discontent feeds violence . In his weekly address to the nation Wednesday, al-Maliki described the assault on Mosul as a ""conspiracy"" to destabilize the country and called on Iraqis to ""stand as one united front."" Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr said in a statement Wednesday that he is ready to form a ""peace brigade"" to work in coordination with the Iraqi government ""to defend the holy places"" of Muslims and Christians. But this brigade probably would be viewed by many as a resurgence of al-Sadr's Mahdi Army, the powerful Shia militia that disbanded at the end of 2008. Its formation could risk worsening the country's underlying problem -- festering sectarian division. The country's minority Sunni population, which prospered under Hussein, feels shut out by al-Maliki's Shia majority-dominated government. A U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN that ISIS had been active in Nineveh province ""for a long time and clearly sensed that Mosul was vulnerable now after engaging in sporadic attacks earlier this year. ""Strategically, the group looks at Syria and Iraq as one interchangeable battlefield, and its ability to shift resources and personnel across the border has measurably strengthened its position in both theaters."" However, the official said ISIS still ""has shown little ability to govern effectively, is generally unpopular and has no sway outside the Sunni community in either Iraq or Syria."" A spokeswoman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry said the fall of Mosul and the situation in Tikrit validates neighboring Tehran's concerns. ""The Islamic Republic of Iran had earlier warned that the danger of terrorism won't be limited to one region and will spread beyond countries. And unfortunately today we are witnessing this issue,"" Marziyeh Afkham told the semiofficial Fars news agency. The siege of Mosul: What's happening? Why is it significant?

"Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ordered a comprehensive review of the military health care system on Tuesday in the wake of the growing VA scandal. Hagel's move comes the same day the Department of Veteran Affairs announced veterans waiting for appointments for more than 30 days at VA hospitals and clinics will have an opportunity to see a doctor sooner. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told CNN that Hagel had been considering the review for some time but decided to act now as he saw the VA scandal, first uncovered by CNN, unfold. The review, which is expected to last for 90 days, will focus on three areas: access to care, hospital safety and quality of care. Meanwhile, amid heavy pressure to address allegations of scheduling tricks and secrets lists to hide monthslong waits for care, the VA released details of its ""Accelerated Access to Care Initiative."" Those accusations have mushroomed since CNN first reported the problem in November in a detailed investigation examining several VA hospitals, reports that prompted President Barack Obama and lawmakers to call for investigations. Part of the initiative, which the VA says was implemented on May 23, calls for all veterans waiting more than 30 days for an appointment to be contacted by the VA to determine whether they want to be seen by a doctor sooner. According to the initiative, the VA will make at minimum three attempts to contact each veteran. If the veteran wants to see a doctor sooner, ""and the capacity and resources exist -- (following the facility assessment), the veteran will be scheduled into new appointment openings,"" according to a fact sheet provided by the VA. If a facility can't handle all of the patients, ""non-VA medical care referral will begin,"" it said. Under the initiative, reviews have been ordered of each VA facility to determine whether it can handle its current patient load. This includes examining whether VA clinics need to extend hours or approve overtime so more veterans can be seen. The reviews are expected to be completed by Friday, according the VA. Obama has promised to hold accountable anyone found to have manipulated or falsified records. The most disturbing problems emerged at the Phoenix VA, with sources revealing details of a secret waiting list. According to the sources, at least 40 American veterans died while waiting for care at the VA there. The top officials at the Phoenix VA denied any existence of a secret waiting list after CNN's initial Phoenix report went out. A fatal wait: Veterans languish and die on a VA hospital's secret list .

Do a similar search in Google Images and your screen is quickly inundated with piles of scattered hacked bodies, grisly mountains of skulls and long columns of fleeing refugees. It's been 20 years since the devastating violence that left about one million people dead in Rwanda, but global perceptions of the tiny country in east-central Africa are often still stuck in 1994. Images of horror and ruin, as captured by the lenses of foreigners, are still circulating internationally, even though the country has come a long way since those dark days. To address this, a new exhibition opens Friday in London, showcasing insightful snapshots of daily life in today's Rwanda as seen through the eyes of local photographers. Called ""Rwanda in Photographs: Death Then, Life Now,"" the show aims to ""communicate the complexities of survival after mass violence,"" organizers say, while helping international audiences to ""understand the scale and scope of the country's journey."" The exhibition features arresting images by more than 10 professional and amateur photographers who back in November took part in an eight-day workshop led by the prominent Nigerian photographer Andrew Esiebo and the Kenya-based American photojournalist Brendan Bannon. ""We worked with the Rwandan photographers to give them the opportunity to visually tell how they see their country,"" explains Esiebo, whose work has been exhibited around the world. ""It was a platform to allow people to come together to tell their stories,"" he adds. ""Often, if you see images coming from Rwanda, the majority has been taken by non-Rwandans -- this is a chance for them to question the way their country is being interpreted."" The final result is a collection of diverse images ranging from intimate portraits to eye-catching landscapes that provide an insight into the complex changes that are currently underway in Rwanda -- snapshots of the rising capital Kigali, where new buildings pop up and assertive women take a leading role in urban commercial life, are accompanied by scenes of rural life, where poverty and hardship endure. The exhibition also features ""Returnees,"" a series of portraits taken by Esiebo capturing Rwandans from all walks of life who've come back to help in the redevelopment of their country. ""The people make the country,"" says Esiebo, who decided to extend his stay in the landlocked country after the workshop to shoot the ""Returnees"" and also produce a Rwandan version of his popular series of photographs of West African barber shops. ""It was quite interesting to see young, vibrant people coming to add value to the society,"" he says. ""It's one of the most fulfilling projects I've seen myself doing lately, especially in the frame of questioning what people see about Rwandans."" Click through the gallery above to see some of the photographs featured in the exhibition. ""Rwanda In Photographs: Death Then, Life Now"" is presented by the Cultural Institute at King's at the Inigo Rooms, Somerset House East Wing, London from 21st March -- 30th April . The exhibition is open daily 12.00-18.00, and until 8pm on Thursdays. Admission is free. Find out more about it here. READ THIS: Orphaned siblings create Rwanda's Craigslist .

"Congress returns to Washington facing the biggest international crisis in years. It is critical the House of Representatives and Senate work together to send a strong and unified message that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is unacceptable, and take quick action to punish President Vladimir Putin. While we are both relatively new to Washington, we've been here long enough to realize that our divided Congress isn't good at ""quick action"" or ""unified messages."" Yet we also recognize that the roots of Russia's actions last week to invade and control Crimea are complex, and they predate President Barack Obama's tenure. This challenge is truly bigger than our partisan divides. Putin clearly decided that the benefits of an armed intervention in Ukraine outweighed whatever costs the United States would be willing to impose. The United States must reset that calculation. In that spirit, we welcome Obama's call for bipartisan action in the Congress, which will hopefully move to quickly pass a serious package of financial support for Ukraine and to bolster the authorities that the administration already has to pursue and penalize Russian individuals and entities. Live blog: 'Strong belief' Russian incursion is illegal . The United States must make clear to Putin that by violating Ukraine's sovereignty and violating multiple international commitments, he has made a strategic miscalculation that will lead to severe impacts for Russia's economy and its standing in the world. Beyond immediate financial actions against the Russian regime and even Putin himself, if Russia attempts to expand its military operations and threatens eastern Ukraine, we and our allies in Europe need to be ready to implement a trade embargo, explore restrictions on imports of Russian natural gas, and cut off Russian banks from the international financial system. We also need to open up exports of domestic natural gas to our allies and partners in the region so that they are less susceptible to Russia's efforts to use energy as a weapon. If, in the coming days, Russia does not back down, Ukraine will require more than just our moral and financial support, including defense assistance in the form of a military assessment team to examine Ukraine's needs, as well as enhanced intelligence cooperation. Putin: Military force last resort . Our allies and partners in Central and Eastern Europe are undoubtedly watching this situation with much apprehension about what it says about the credibility of American leadership and the future of the transatlantic alliance. To this end, we need to support our emerging partners in the region. For years, Georgia has been requesting a defensive arms package that would include anti-aircraft and anti-tank capabilities that the 2008 conflict showed were sorely needed. We need to provide this support and finalize a Membership Action Plan (MAP) for Georgia to join NATO. For those partners already in the pipeline for membership, we should move up accession as soon as possible, even as early as the NATO Summit in Wales in September. Recent events should break the freeze on NATO expansion that has been in place for the past five years. It is precisely the ambiguity in which NATO left Georgia after the 2008 Bucharest Summit that fueled Russia's belief that it can bully NATO partners and not face a credible response. Opinion: Why it will be hard for West to stop Putin . We also need to show solidarity with our allies who are already in NATO. We should make clear that we share Turkey's concerns about the status of Crimean Turks and other ethnic minorities. And we should reject Russia's claims that it is protecting ethnic Russians. How should our friends in Vilnius, Riga, or Tallinn take Russian rhetoric about the need to ""protect"" ethnic Russians in Ukraine when they, too, have significant populations of ethnic Russians living in their countries? NATO should review its force posture in the region and take tangible steps to show the credibility of our Article V guarantee to the most vulnerable members of the alliance.  This should include strengthening the NATO and U.S. military presence in frontline member states. We also need to admit to ourselves that the significant military cuts proposed by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel a week ago are entirely unrealistic in today's threat environment, and that as we focus more on Asia, we cannot ignore ongoing threats to European security. None of this will be easy. It will require leadership, not crisis management focused on de-escalation, which seems to be the primary concern of the White House. Some of our European allies have responded strongly, and others will need prodding from the administration and even the President himself. Some may argue that these actions are overly provocative and will only encourage Russia to be more aggressive. But provoking Russia is exactly what five years of ""reset"" has now achieved. If we do not take these steps, similar actions by Russia and other authoritarian regimes around the world will only proliferate. So, too, will the uncertainty and hedging of our global allies and potential partners, who already, from Latin America to the Middle East to Asia, have plenty of reasons to doubt our seriousness and question whether America will continue to be the leading force for peace and stability in the world in the decades to come. The stakes are extremely high, but this is an opportunity to correct some of the mistakes we have made recently in our relationship with Russia and to send a message heard around the world that America is not going anywhere.

"On the subject of Silvio Berlusconi Italians and non-Italians are, to paraphrase George Bernard-Shaw's famous quip about Britain and America, divided by a common political language. We think we share the view that in a political world dominated by mass communications, there is little room for forgiveness about scandals, or other personal failures, or a poor record in office. Yet on those grounds, Berlusconi should have died a political death long ago, rather than coming a very close second in this week's Italian elections. Foreigners, perhaps, will always remain baffled by Berlusconi's success in continuing to attract voters. But Italians, horrified by him though plenty of them are, tend to be a lot less surprised. That is because they think of him in context, rather than in isolation. In Italian politics, the context is all. What this means, and what it meant for Berlusconi's remarkable feat in nearly doubling his share of the vote between his opinion poll ratings in November 2012 and the election itself, can be laid out in the following evidently misleading indicators: . He makes unbelievable promises. In part this is true: one of Berlusconi's traits is his willingness to say one thing today and the opposite tomorrow, to attract attention from different groups or on different occasions, totally without shame. Italians know this, and those who support him tend to see it as an endearing part of his character, part of his desire to entertain and to please. But also it is misleading: the key promise he made during the 2013 election campaign was entirely believable -- that he would cut or even abolish a dreaded property tax, known by its Italian initials as IMU. His record makes him untrustworthy. Yes, on overall economic policy. But not on taxes. He has promised to cut them before, and has delivered on at least some of those promises. The promise to cut IMU was made in an incredibly artful way, as he wrote to voters saying he would pay them back for the tax from his own pocket, which very few will have believed. But that did not matter: it drew attention to the proposal in an eye-catching way, and reinforced the only important point -- that he would cut the tax. Opinion: Italy's election leaves country, and eurozone, on financial high-wire . He is irresponsible. Yes, but so is almost everyone to the cynical Italian political mind. His plan for how to finance this tax cut had as many holes in it as a sieve, but that did not really matter. It would have to be financed by taxes on other people, or cuts in spending on other things. Fine, said his voters: at least this awful tax will go. In offering a relentless focus on that tax, he showed that he was listening to the pain of his voters and taking them seriously, rather than talking down to them like most other parties. His trials and sex scandals make him a national shame. Not really, though at times his behavior has stretched even the Italian tolerance. But the context is important: plenty of people think the justice system works disastrously badly in Italy, so if Berlusconi is caught up in it -- like so many others -- then so what? And his sex scandals are really part of his own marketing plan: he cavorts with scantily clad young women in order to make himself look glamorous, young, entertaining and happy. Moreover, his antics with women act as a distraction from his other weaknesses, like a kind of tranquillizer for those who might otherwise get angry with him. A lot of Italians, especially young women, hate him for this. But enough either don't care or are sympathetic enough to him to mean that this does not harm him fatally in political terms. His opponents are more statesmanlike and responsible. Yes, that is true of Mario Monti, the caretaker prime minister for the past year who then decided to run in the elections with a centrist list of candidates. But it is not particularly true of his big opponents -- including the left-wing Democratic Party, which has its own scandals, its own selfish interests and, during the election campaign, its own evidence of the abuse of political power in the case of Italy's third-largest (and oldest) bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena, whose business was allegedly run and distorted in the interests of local Democratic Party politicians in that area. So the PD (by its Italian initials) is also viewed as selfish by the public, neutralizing Berlusconi's disadvantage on that measure. Since both the PD leader, Pier Luigi Bersani, and Monti are dull, leaden communicators who failed to offer any positive, hopeful message for their voters, the way was opened for Berlusconi. News: Italy seeks way out of political chaos . Only one party in the election really stood for change: the Five Star Movement of Beppe Grillo. This meant that Berlusconi's old-fashioned, tax-cutting message, geared towards preserving his own political power, had plenty of space in which to operate. And although Berlusconi did not stand for change, he was at least cheerful, smiling and entertaining. Politics is now all about personalities, as was shown by the rise of Grillo, but he and Berlusconi are opposites in this regard. It is true that the discrediting of traditional political parties, combined with the preeminence of television, has given personalities a huge advantage in Italian politics, even if neither the PD nor Monti seemed able to grasp this. Personalities and even personal stories breed attention and loyalty, even if from different groups. One of the last Italian politicians to understand and exploit this was, unfortunately, Benito Mussolini. Oh, and did I forget to mention that Berlusconi owns Italy's three main commercial TV channels and its biggest advertising sales agency, and has billions of euros in cash to hand around to supporters and allies? Well, that isn't a misleading indicator. But it is a reason, perhaps too obvious to dwell upon, for Berlusconi's continuing success at the ripe old age of 76.","Scandal-plagued three time ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi finished second in Italy's election .

"(CNN) -- Two goals from Ji Dong-won ensured South Korea ended the Asian Cup in third place after they beat Uzbekistan 3-2 in Qatar. Their victory also means they qualify automatically for the next installment of the competition, to be held in Australia in 2014. It had looked like the result would not be in any doubt as South Korea raced into a three-goal lead inside 39 minutes but Uzbekistan hit back to ensure a nervy last half an hour. Having been beaten by Japan on penalties in the semifinal, South Korea flew out of the traps and looked to put pressure on their opponents, who were thrashed 6-0 by Australia in the other final four clash. It took just 17 minutes for South Korea to find the net as Koo Ja-cheol latched onto Lee Yong-rae's pass to finish emphatically past Uzbek goalkeeper Ignatiy Nesterov. It was 2-0 ten minutes later when Ji Dong-won ended a neat passing move with a low finish into the bottom corner. And when Ji's downward header crept past Nesterov after 39 minutes it looked like Uzbekistan were on course for another painful defeat. But just before half time they were offered a glimmer of hope when Hwang Jae-won brought down Timur Kapadze in the penalty area. Alexander Geynrikh successfully dispatched his first effort but it was ruled out because players from both sides had encroached into the area. The striker made no mistake with the retake. Geynrikh then registered a superb second to put Uzbekistan right back in the game. He swiveled on a cross from the left and beat Lee Jung-soo before shooting into the net. Ji hit the inside of the post with an effort on 61 minutes and as the game entered its final stages Uzbekistan piled on the pressure. But South Korea held firm.","South Korea beat Uzbekistan 3-2 to take third place at the Asian Cup .

"Baltimore Ravens star running back Ray Rice was indicted Thursday on an aggravated assault charge stemming from an altercation with his fiancée at an Atlantic City, New Jersey, casino last month, prosecutors said. Rice was charged with third-degree aggravated assault, a crime that carries a potential penalty of three to five years' imprisonment, according to Acting Atlantic County Prosecutor Jim McClain. Rice's attorney, Michael Diamondstein, could not be immediately reached for comment Thursday. Police were called to the Revel Casino and Hotel in the early morning hours of February 15 to respond to a domestic dispute between the Pro-Bowl running back and his girlfriend, Janay Palmer. ""After reviewing surveillance footage it appeared both parties were involved in a physical altercation,"" read the Atlantic City Police report. Both Rice, 27, and Palmer, 26, struck each other with their hands, according to the complaint. Both were arrested on  assault charges and released the next morning. Shortly after the incident, TMZ.com posted surveillance video of a man it said was Rice dragging an apparently unconscious woman from an elevator at the Revel Casino. The video does not show either party striking the other. Diamondstein confirmed to CNN's Alexandra Field that the man in the video was indeed his client shortly after TMZ posted it. ""There's a significant set of facts that the public doesn't know about yet,"" Diamondstein told Field. ""As soon as those facts come to light, we believe the public will have a different opinion."" ""No party committed any crime,"" Palmer's lawyer, Robert Gamburg, told CNN at the time. The simple assault against Palmer was dismissed, according to McClain. ""This is part of the due process for Ray,"" Baltimore Ravens Director of Media Relations Chad Steele said Thursday of the indictment.

"A Connecticut judge has ordered the release of 911 calls from the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, according to court documents obtained by CNN. Connecticut Superior Court Judge Eliot Prescott's ruling upholds a decision by the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission to release the calls related to the December 2012 shooting. In doing so, the judge denied an application from State Attorney Stephen Sedensky to stay the commission's decision. In his ruling, Prescott grants ""the plaintiff and Newtown respondents a short period of time to attempt to obtain appellate relief from this decision."" If no higher court grants the appeal, the 911 audio recordings will be released on December 4 at 2 p.m. ET. The massacre at Sandy Hook left 26 people dead, including 20 children, making it the second-deadliest shooting in U.S. history. The gunman, Adam Lanza, shot himself at the end of his 11-minute rampage. The killings in Newtown, about 60 miles outside New York, happened less than five months after a similar bloodbath at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, outside Denver. Those mass slayings triggered a nationwide debate over gun violence, school safety and mental health, a debate that produced some new restrictions on firearms in several states. A backlash against those laws by gun-rights advocates followed, and there was only limited action on a federal level after a Republican filibuster blocked expanded background checks for gun buyers.

"Washington (CNN) -- The annual Conservative Political Action Conference drew 10,000 activists to Washington over the weekend. The event traditionally concludes with a presidential straw poll. Last year, the poll was won by Mitt Romney. This year, Ron Paul won, with 31 percent of the ballots cast. CPAC's organizers cautioned against over-interpreting the Paul win. Participation in the poll had been light, the Paul team had just out-organized, etc. All true enough. But it's also true that Ron Paul-style themes have percolated through the conservative movement since Paul's beat-the-spread 2008 presidential campaign. Of all those themes, the one that has achieved the widest audience is Paul's call for a return to money based on precious metals such as gold and silver. G.K. Chesterton observed that you should never pull down a fence until you understand why it was put up. So let's rediscover why it was that Americans abandoned the gold standard in the first place. In 1929, the U.S. economy slumped into recession. Under the weight of a series of terrible decisions, that recession collapsed into the worldwide Great Depression. But why did decision-makers make so many bad decisions? The short answer is that they were trapped. Almost all of the right decisions would have ballooned the U.S. federal budget deficit. As budget deficits expanded, investors would inevitably worry that their dollars might lose value in the future. They would demand to trade their dollars for gold at the fixed price of $20.67 to the ounce. Under the rules of the gold standard, the U.S. government would be obliged to sell. As long as the deficits continued, the U.S. government would lose gold. Threatened with the exhaustion of its gold supply, the government felt it had no choice: It had to close the budget deficit. So, in the throes of a severe downturn, the U.S. government did exactly the opposite of what economists would otherwise advise: It cut spending and raised taxes -- capsizing the economy even deeper into depression. It's very strange to hear gold standard advocates criticize President Hoover for imposing steep tax increases in 1932, the Depression's worst year. Yet the gold standard they champion was the reason for the tax increases they deplore. Between 1929 and 1932, the U.S. money supply collapsed, as banks failed and bank deposits and commercial credit vanished. In their classic ""Monetary History of the United States"" (1966), Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz identified this contraction of the money supply as the proximate cause of the Great Depression. Why didn't the Federal Reserve act to prevent the contraction? Again: the gold standard. In a modern recession, the Fed will buy Treasury securities in the open market. After the purchase and sale, the Federal Reserve has more securities -- and the former owners of the securities have new cash. Those new cash owners then spend or lend their cash, spurring economic activity. But in 1930, the new cash owners didn't spend or lend. They swapped their cash for gold. The ""open market"" operations that were supposed to accelerate economic activity instead accelerated the country's gold drain. So the Fed ceased -- and instead passively allowed the economy to collapse in order to save the nation's currency. Every other gold-standard country faced similar challenges in the 1930s. Those countries that quit gold first, like Britain, suffered least. Those that hung onto gold longest -- the United States and France -- suffered most. Imagine now if the gold standard were in operation today. The federal government would be scrambling to balance its budget in the midst of recession, cutting spending and raising taxes. Instead of pumping money into the economy, the Federal Reserve would be sucking money out. Priority 1 would not be creating and saving jobs, but preserving the nation's gold hoard. Instead of living through the nastiest recession since the war, we'd be deep into a second Great Depression. But in a way, this counterfactual is impossible. No government ever can return to the gold standard. Back in the 1930s, governments accepted horrific suffering because they were terrified of the consequences of going off gold. When President Franklin Roosevelt told his budget director, Lewis Douglas, of his decision to quit gold, Douglas replied: ""This is the end of Western civilization."" He wasn't kidding either. In fact, the decision was the turning point of the Depression, the beginning of recovery. And every monetary economist knows it. Which means that the first thing any future gold-standard government would do in the event of recession would be to jettison gold. And every market trader knows that too. So ... as soon as the first sign of recession materializes on the horizon, the traders would dump the currency of the gold standard country. The gold standard country would then have to decide whether to self-impose draconian 1932-style budget-balancing or forgo the whole painful experience and surrender right away to what is inevitable sooner or later. Since everybody knows that a gold standard country would quit gold as soon as times got tough, nobody will ever believe the decision to restore the gold standard in the first place. It's as dead as monocles and walking sticks. Deader, really. The punch line to one of my favorite anecdotes goes, ""Son, your answers are so old, I have forgotten the questions."" Has the Depression receded so far into history that the answers that once plunged the nation into misery can possibly look credible again? The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of David Frum.","Ron Paul won the presidential straw poll at the CPAC conference .
David Frum says part of Paul's appeal is his advocacy of basing dollars on precious metals .

"The three-year war in Syria has claimed 162,402 lives, an opposition group said Monday, as the raging conflict shows no signs of abating. The dead include 8,607 children, according to the the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. It said the total numbers included civilians, military members, defected  soldiers and foreign fighters, among others. United Nations officials said they stopped updating their death toll in July because of lack of access and the inability to verify information from sources. At the time, it said that well over 100,000 people, including many civilians, have been killed in the war pitting government forces against rebels seeking to end the rule of President Bashar al- Assad. The political uprising against al-Assad's regime started with mostly peaceful protests in Daraa province in March 2011. Syria responded with a ferocious crackdown against demonstrators and has consistently said it is battling armed terrorist groups as it targeted anti-government protesters. Al-Assad, whose family has ruled Syria for more than four decades,  succeeded his father in 2000 and won a second term in 2007. Syria's next presidential election is scheduled for next month, and al-Assad has registered to run again. The United Nations has asked his government to reconsider the election as the carnage mounts daily.

"(CNN) -- Ruby Dee, the award-winning actress whose seven-decade career included triumphs on stage and screen, has died. She was 91. Dee died peacefully Wednesday at her New Rochelle, New York, home, according to her representative, Michael Livingston. Dee -- often with her late husband, Ossie Davis -- was a formidable force in both the performing arts community and the civil rights movement. The couple were master and mistress of ceremonies at the 1963 March on Washingon, and she was friends with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. Dee received the Frederick Douglass Award in 1970 from the New York Urban League. As an actress, her film credits included ""The Jackie Robinson Story"" (1950), ""A Raisin in the Sun"" (1961), ""Buck and the Preacher"" (1972), ""Do the Right Thing"" (1989) and ""American Gangster"" (2007). Dee earned an Oscar nomination for her performance in ""Gangster."" She won an Emmy and Grammy for other work. Broadway star Audra McDonald paid tribute to Dee when she accepted a Tony Award on Sunday, crediting Dee, Maya Angelou, Diahann Carroll and Billie Holiday for making her career possible. McDonald won a best actress Tony in 2004 for playing the same role Dee created on Broadway in 1959 and in the 1961 film version of ""Raisin."" In a statement, Gil Robertson IV of the African American Film Critics Association praised Dee's contributions. ""The members of the African American Film Critics Association are deeply saddened at the loss of actress and humanitarian Ruby Dee,"" said Robertson. ""Throughout her seven-decade career, Ms. Dee embraced different creative platforms with her various interpretations of black womanhood and also used her gifts to champion for Human Rights. Her strength, courage and beauty will be greatly missed."" Dee was born Ruby Ann Wallace in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1922, and moved to New York's Harlem as a child. She took the surname Dee after marrying blues singer Frankie Dee two decades later. She divorced Dee after a short marriage and was wedded to Davis in 1948. Davis preceded his wife in death in 2005. 'With Ossie and Ruby' Her acting career started in New York in the 1940s, first appearing onscreen in the 1946 musical ""That Man of Mine."" A role in ""The Jackie Robinson Story"" brought her national attention. Dee became known to a younger generation with roles in two Spike Lee films. She co-starred with Davis in Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"" and in his 1991 film ""Jungle Fever."" First lady Michelle Obama tweeted that she was ""deeply saddened"" by Dee's death. ""I'll never forget seeing her in 'Do the Right Thing' on my first date with Barack."" Dee's television work included 20 episodes of ""Peyton Place"" in 1969 and the role of Queen Haley in the 1979 miniseries ""Roots: The Next Generation."" 'The finest performance I have ever seen' She was regularly praised for her acting. In the 1961 film version of ""Raisin,"" Lorraine Hansberry's play about a working-class black family trying to move up in the world, she played Ruth Younger, the wife of Sidney Poitier's striving Walter. ""Miss Dee is quietly magnificent as the angry young man's hard-working wife,"" wrote Bosley Crowther in The New York Times. Her stage work was equally lauded. ""Ruby Dee as Lena is giving the finest performance I have ever seen,"" wrote The New York Times' Clive Barnes in 1970 of Dee in Athol Fugard's play ""Boesman and Lena."" ""Never for a moment do you think she is acting."" She won an Obie for that performance in 1971. Other awards included a 1972 Drama Desk award for ""Wedding Band,"" a 1991 Emmy for ""Decoration Day,"" a 2007 Grammy for spoken-word album and a Golden Globe for ""American Gangster."" Actor Samuel L. Jackson, who was in ""Jungle Fever"" and ""Do the Right Thing"" with Dee, tweeted: ""We Lost A Jewel Today, Mrs Ruby Dee, So Great, So Loved! R.I.P. All sympathy to her family."" Director Spike Lee tweeted that he was ""crushed"" by the loss of Dee, whom he called ""'spiritual mother."" Always an activist . Dee and Davis -- the two, who were married 56 years, always seemed connected -- were an odd couple in some ways: She from New York, he from Waycross, Georgia. She was small and stylish, he was big and bluff. But their beliefs were often as one, and they practiced what they preached. ""We shared a great deal in common; we didn't have any distractions as to where we stood in society. We were black activists. We had a common understanding,"" she told Ebony in 1988. Dee and Davis met while acting in the 1945 Broadway play ""Jeb"" in 1945. He proposed three years later with a telegram he sent from Chicago, where he was touring in a play, according to their joint autobiography ""With Ossie and Ruby: In This Life Together,"" published near their 50th anniversary. The telegram to his girlfriend said he ""might as well marry"" her. Dee wrote back, ""Don't do me any favors."" Their book revealed the challenges of their long marriage, including a phase in the 1960s in which they agreed they could sleep with others when work separated them. The arrangement lasted only a short time, they said. ""We ultimately decided that what we had chosen as a possibility didn't really work for us,"" Davis said in 1999. ""You have to learn how to be married,"" Dee said. ""You have to learn to love somebody."" There was no television in their home for years, The New York Times observed in a 1995 profile, because ""television represented an industry that refused to hire black people in significant numbers or in anything other than stereotypical roles."" They appeared at protest rallies and took their children with them. She admitted to a fiery temperament: In a famous ""American Gangster"" scene, she slaps star Denzel Washington across the face, noting she put everything into the motion. ""It's not far from my nature to whack,"" she told USA Today. ""There's a streak in me."" Ruby Dee, Ossie Davis arrested at protest . Dee and Davis were arrested in 1999 while protesting outside New York City police headquarters against the police shooting of an unarmed African immigrant, Amadou Diallo. Dee told reporters the shooting ""reminds me of when there were lynchings all over the country."" ""We've got to start saying 'No further. This must stop,' "" Dee said. Even before the appearances in Spike Lee movies made them famous faces again, Dee and Davis were always working, always pushing, whether it was producing a 1986 PBS special on King or creating a two-person show drawing on the work of African-American writer Zora Neale Hurston. The two also shared a lot of laughter. ""The life is the fun,"" she told the Times in 1995. ""We walk in the middle of humor every day, and we laugh,"" Davis responded. ""And we fight, too,"" Dee replied. ""Yeah. I win."" Dee is survived by three children, Guy Davis, Hasna Muhammad Davis and Nora Day Davis.

"Miranshah, Pakistan (CNN) -- In a tea shop in Miranshah, a dusty town in northeastern Pakistan, an empty kettle hangs on a hook waiting to be used, while flies hover over baskets piled high with sweetmeats drying out in the July sunshine. The surrounding streets are unusually quiet -- no children playing, no old men selling fruit, no whir of machinery from local workshops. The buzz of life has been replaced by deathly silence in the largest town in Pakistan's troubled North Waziristan. Much of it now lies in ruin, its population nowhere to be seen. In a rare visit organized by Pakistan's military, I was one of the few journalists transported into the region where the army has been waging a full-scale ground offensive against militants since mid-June. The operation has been named Zarb-e-Azb after a famous sword of the prophet Muhammad. Maj. General Zafar Khan, the commander of the Pakistan army's 7th Division and the man in charge of the operation, told CNN that in the months leading up to campaign, the region had become ""a hub and safe haven"" for militants -- foreign and local -- in Pakistan. For almost three weeks, North Waziristan, a mountainous region bordering Afghanistan, was pummeled by a series of air strikes before ground troops moved in. According to Khan, 80% of Miranshah and its surrounding areas have been cleared of militants. Unfortunately, the local population appears to have been cleared too. The head of Pakistan's Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR), Maj. General Asim Bajwa, guides us through various compounds recovered in the town, which is now back under military control. Leaving the 7th division base, we're driven through a land of beige, past villages such as Machis, which has been hit by drone strikes and now lies abandoned. Soldiers stand guard outside a suspected al Qaeda compound near the village. According to Bajwa, recovered pamphlets and papers indicate it was used by fighters affiliated with the terror network. We're led down a series of steep steps inside the compound, and we find ourselves in a cold, labyrinth of tunnels, with only the dim light from our torches to guide us. Bajwa tells us the tunnels ""go on for at least two kilometers."" It's a formidable operating base for militants. The drive to the town proper is surreal: vintage film music plays as the soldiers accompanying us discuss the Germany-Brazil World Cup match the previous night. Outside our windows, we see troops searching blast-damaged and hollowed-out buildings. We're told not to stray from the group since the area has not been completely cleared of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) -- the signature bomb of militants in the region. According to Maj. General Khan, at least 23 tons of IED-making equipment has been recovered from Miranshah. In the courtyard of a house in the battered remains of the town's bazaar, guns and ammunition have been displayed in abstract designs, bullets placed in macabre symmetry. Military officials tell us that this was the compound used by the East Turkestan Islamic Movement -- a murky terror group blamed for attacks in other countries in the wider region such as China. We're shown the in-house dental clinic that they had established for themselves. Alleged terrorists get toothaches, too, it would seem. A mosque provides the front for another underground hideout; a series of steps lead up to a bookshelf that opens up like a door into a secret passageway that we're told was used as an escape route. It seems that no one was captured. Maj. General Khan says leaders of other groups such as the Pakistan Taliban fled into Afghanistan before the ground operation began. ""They now manage things from across the border,"" he says. Military sources say over 400 militants have been killed in this operation, but information about which groups they are affiliated with is vague. Meanwhile, the number of internally displaced people from North Waziristan has now reached over 876,000, according to figures released by the FATA Disaster Management Authority, Pakistan's federal government organization that administers the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Despite the access, details about the captured militants seem opaque. As we're leaving North Waziristan, we find that a new militant group called Lashkar-e-Saif has declared its existence, claiming that the regions of ""Spinwam, Dosalli, Razmak, Dattakheil, Shawal, Shava and other parts of Waziristan are under the full control of Taliban while security forces are only controlling Mirali Bazaar and Miranshah Bazaar."" The military denies the existence of any such group. ""We will never let militants return to North Waziristan,"" Khan tells the press in this valley in the foothills of the Hindu Kush Mountains. Yet the very next day, Abidullah Abid, the spokesperson of the shadowy Lashkar-e-Saif claims they ""will welcome security forces with bullets in Waziristan."" This month of alleged gains by the Pakistani Army, it would seem is only the beginning for operation Zarb-e-Azb. Journalist Saleem Mehsud contributed to this report from Islamabad.","Miranshah remains empty after Pakistan military operation in North Waziristan .

"The recent op-ed by Rick Santorum and Joel C. Rosenberg is yet another attempt to stymie and shackle Iran and international negotiators in ongoing talks about Iran's peaceful nuclear program. Iran should be able to enjoy its right to peaceful nuclear energy while avoiding further hostilities and instability. Particularly illogical is their joining in the decades-old rhetoric, comparing who they see as their foe -- Iran -- to Adolf Hitler. Their view of the diplomatic path is misguided. Their attempt to compare the Iranian government to the murderous Third Reich is ludicrous, counterproductive and unfortunate. The Hitler analogy has a long and tortured history. For many decades, those seeking to circumvent peaceful conflict resolution have resorted to the crude Hitler analogy, comparing others to the hideous ruler. Santorum and Rosenberg affirmed comparisons of Russian President Vladimir Putin to Hitler earlier in the same article. But their comparisons to Hitler carry some insidious inferences. They say that since Hitler's claim that he desired peace was a lie, Iran's claims to want peace cannot be believed. Therefore diplomacy in general can't happen and thus nations are locked in a policy of continuous war and aggression. They also seek to undermine any constructive debate about policy, and instead have the public and policy makers act out of sheer panic rather than thoughtful statesmanship. Those favoring a rush to hostility have always used the Hitler comparison to circumvent sensible deliberation and intimidate others. They want nations to support the impulsive use of force at times when they know using force is the wrong path and that diplomacy is best for national and global security. This is not to say that there aren't many valuable lessons to be learned from the failure to quickly confront the menace of the Third Reich. The world should not have stood by as Hitler invaded his neighbors. Iran, by contrast, has not invaded any of its neighbors over the past 250 years. Thus, comparing Iran to Nazi Germany is illogical and should be condemned for the sake of peace and global security. The current efforts by the Iranian government to reach a diplomatic resolution on the nuclear file is not a tactic but, as many independent observers have noted, reflects its will to compromise and re-engage the world with mutual respect and the peaceful resolution of conflict. President Hassan Rouhani, who won an election that had a voter turnout of 73%,  campaigned on the platform of reaching understanding with the West on a number of issues, including the nuclear file. That is the basis of Iran's current policy. Santorum and Rosenberg also recommend President Barack Obama support efforts by some in Congress to pass new sanctions. But those sanctions would violate the terms of the interim agreement, or at the very least, impose the strictest possible parameters on the American negotiators.  Those parameters would either significantly harm sensitive international negotiations or derail the process altogether. Also, the interim accord reached in Geneva is a very transparent agreement based on verification as well as strict inspections, so both sides feel assured as they seek a final status agreement. Santorum and Rosenberg also point to a poll commissioned by Rosenberg that they claim indicates popular support for their perception of Iran. It's worth noting that neither Rosenberg nor the conservative polling firm have disclosed the full results of the poll or their methodology. But even if this poll was to be given weight, the spread of this extremely negative perception of Iran among some in the American public -- championed by people like the authors -- is not a logical rationalization. Additionally, if we are to look at polls, numerous ones published by major nonpartisan polling firms show strong support for diplomacy among the American people, according to some by a 2-to-1 margin. For example in a CNN/ORC International Poll, three out of four Americans support diplomacy over conflict, including 87% of Democrats and 68% of Republicans. Rosenberg is a former Israeli official. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's complete opposition to any peaceful solution has been on full display since the potential of diplomatic conflict resolution became apparent. Santorum's attempt to put out hawkish statement is understandable in light of his electoral ambitions. But since global security is on the line, the decisions that guide this process should not be made based on political posturing or hysteria. And they should not give outsized consideration to the overzealous hyperbole of those who reflexively oppose diplomacy, who still consider the Iraq boondoggle a prudent war. They should rather be made with meticulous consideration of the national interests and with an eye -- and cautious optimism -- toward a negotiated settlement that could relieve tensions and even a reversal of the current dynamic of hostility.

"The first official nuclear negotiations since Hassan Rouhani came to power in Iran have concluded in Geneva. And while the negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 will continue in November, this week's meetings have raised several crucial questions. Can these talks be characterized as positive diplomatic and political moves for all sides, including Iran, Britain, China, France, Russia, the United States and Germany?  And how can we characterize and analyze the Iranian presentation, titled ""Closing an unnecessary Crisis: Opening new horizons"", which aimed at proposing ways to address international concerns on Iranian programs in return for sanctions relief and international recognition of Iran's right to enrich uranium? Firstly, these two-day talks should be contextualized within the larger context of past and future negotiations between Iran, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the P5+1. These talks and first round of negotiations ought not be analyzed and viewed as the sole indicators of success or failure in the discussions on Iran's nuclear enrichment and program. Without doubt, several indications from these first formal talks project a constructive image of the negotiations. Michael Mann, spokesman for Catherine Ashton, the European Union's top foreign policy official and the lead negotiator in the talks, said that the Iranian proposal had been ""very useful ... For the first time, very detailed technical discussions continued this afternoon."" Other recent diplomatic progress can be seen at the bilateral meetings between the U.S. and Iranian delegations -- meetings that can be regarded as an extension of a potential U.S.-Iran rapprochement, Rouhani's charm offensive, and the exchange of letters and pleasantries between Rouhani and Barack Obama. Despite being in the early stages, the talks seem to have been more of a success for Iran than the U.S. and its Western allies. Speaking in English and using PowerPoint to outline his proposal, the U.S.-educated foreign minister, Javad Zarif, created the first (and necessary) positive impression that would set the stage for future nuclear talks and the possible easing of sanctions that are crippling Iran's economy. The Iranian lauded ""serious"" talks that had been conducted in a ""highly positive atmosphere."" Iran has now made it much more difficult for the Western powers to make an effective case for further sanctions on Iran. The critical issue, however, is whether Iranian authorities as well as representatives of P5+1 have achieved their major political and diplomatic objectives with regards to Tehran's nuclear program. The significant complexities and nuances of the objectives of Iran, the IAEA, and P5+1 have not yet been made clear based on these two-day talks in Geneva. Tehran's fundamental aim is to ease the economic sanctions and put an end to the country's prolonged economic isolation through a softening of its tone and making efforts to reach a resolution. The West's major objective is to move from cautious optimism to confidence, with the ability to assert that Iran is not pursuing its nuclear program for weaponry but rather for peaceful purposes with full transparency. It remains to be seen whether Iran and the P5+1 can achieve their goals in these talks, particularly at a time when the underlying political gap between the Iranian and Western stance on Tehran's nuclear enrichment seems to be too deep to bridge. In these talks, Iran has clearly stated that it possess the right to continue enriching uranium according to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, with Western leaders pointing out that Iran ought to slow down or suspend its activities until a resolution is reached. The next round of negotiations will undoubtedly shed more light on the nuances and underlying complexities of the situation. Only then will we find out whether these talks marked a new chapter in Iran's relationship with the West, or merely a disappointing continuation of the last one.","The talks seem to have been more of a success for Iran than the U.S., writes Majid Rafizadeh .

"Four U.S. Air Force personnel died after a military helicopter crashed Tuesday evening near Cley, on the North Sea coast of England, authorities said. A news release from police in Norfolk said a U.S. Air Force Pave Hawk HH-60G helicopter from a British base in Lakenheath had crashed and the four people aboard were dead. ""I would like to pass on my condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of those US Air Force personnel who have sadly lost their lives in this tragic incident,"" Sarah Hamlin with the Norfolk Constabulary said in a statement released Wednesday. The Pentagon had no update on the official status of those on board.  The Norfolk Constabulary said details on those killed would not be released until next of kin have been notified. Police said a large area had been cordoned off as authorities responded and secured the site.  An investigation into the cause of the crash is expected to take several days. The RAF base said the crash occurred during an evening training mission while the helicopter was flying low. Cley is 180 kilometers (about 110 miles) northeast of London. According to the Air Force website, a Pave Hawk is a ""highly modified"" version of a Black Hawk helicopter that often carries a crew of two pilots, one flight engineer and one gunner.","An investigation into the cause is expected to take several days, police say .

"Turkish Airlines has gone from strength to strength in recent years, adding new routes across Europe and Asia as well as expanding into Africa. A new multi-billion dollar hub airport in the works in Istanbul means this impressive growth story will soon be given yet another boost. But with many ambitious competitors also expanding across the Gulf and the Middle East, can the Turkish aviation vision continue to soar? John Defterios spoke to the airline's CEO, Temel Kotil, to find out. Below is an edited version of their conversation. John Defterios (JD): Why do you think there is so much growth coming out of Turkey? Temel Kotil (TK): The airline business is so big and economies are growing in East Asia, Africa and Europe which is feeding us so we are going to grow. This is very simple. JD: When do you get to the point when the market is too saturated as there are also many expanding hubs across the Middle East and particularly in the Gulf states? TK: That's the beauty of the airline business. There are about 3.1 billion travelers and by 2030 that will be between seven or eight billion, so there are more coming. We are growing at 18%. Our friends in the Gulf are growing at about 10% to 15%. What is happening is that passengers are floating (between carriers). So you have the option to go from City X in Europe to City Y in Asia to go via Istanbul, via Dubai, via Abu Dhabi and so on. Who will become the winner will be the airline who loves the passengers. We love the passengers. We are the best airline in Europe for the last two years. Hopefully we will continue that but who knows? We will work hard. It's a big business and it's a big market. If we are good we can become the winner. (Having a) good brand, quality, prices, network, size; this matters. JD: You're building major infrastructure in Istanbul with a third airport that has a $35 billion price tag. Some say this is grandiosity and that you don't really need an airport of that size. How do you counter these critics? TK: No, we need it. From Istanbul we have to cover the whole of Europe. We have more than 100 destinations coming as a European carrier. We (also) cover the whole of the Middle East, Africa, northern Africa, Central Africa all through Central Asia. This means Turkish Airlines becomes a nice feeder from Istanbul. By 2023, depending upon ourselves will be... 120 million (passengers every year). Because of this... you can make a big investment in the airport. (We can) combine these bigger airports with the passenger capabilities of the Turkish Airlines. History will change. The Asian carriers who are feeding the other hubs (just now) they will appear in Istanbul. Today they want to fly to Istanbul but because of capacity concerns they are not coming. Turkey is a growing country. The cost issue is not a problem because of the volume from Turkish Airlines is already put on the table already.","Turkish Airlines expanding into Asia, Europe and Africa .

"(CNN)Looking for a spa break? In the past, the world's chill-seekers might have ventured to Thailand or India to get their massage fix. In the future, they're more apt to be Africa-bound. A new report in the Global Spa and Wellness Monitor puts Sub-Saharan Africa as the world's fastest growing region for wellness tourism. The number of spas has tripled since 2007, and spa revenue has leaped 184%. The number of those lured to the continent for a little R&R has also soared. 2013 saw 4.2 million wellness tourists -- a 90% increase from 2012. As a testament to this growth, this year's annual Global Spa and Wellness Summit took place in Morocco -- the first time the event was held on African soil. ""Africa is seen as the final frontier. It's virgin territory,"" says Magatte Wade, the Senegal-born founder and CEO of beauty brand Tiossan, and a keynote speaker at the summit. She attributes the continent's spike in spas not only to the increase of international travelers, but to the growth of the consumer class within Africa. ""The middle class is growing, there are more African billionaires right now, and then you have people like me, who've had the opportunity to live all over the world and have money to spend, and want to go back home and have the same top-of-the-line service you have in New York or Tokyo,"" she says. The wellness trend has also started to leak into Africa's safari industry, according to Henry Hallward, founder of both the Good Safari Guide and the Safari Awards, and former chairman of the African Tourism and Travel Association. Hallward estimates there are 9,000 safari lodge operators today, up from approximately 400 in 1995. Pampering, he admits, has also become a stronger focus. ""Almost every safari lodge that I'm aware of has added into its suite of services either massage, or else an entire spa branded by product suppliers,"" he says. A geographical shift . Even countries that were once eschewed due to political concerns are set to emerge as wellness hotspots. Hallward says he's seen growth in markets such as Ethiopia and even the Sudan, ""now that the politics has calmed down."" He is also noticing a shift in the type of safaris on offer. The old formula of trekking the ""Big Five"" in the Masai Mara from the comfort of a jeep is outdated. Instead, safaris are becoming more active, and different countries are starting to specialize in niche versions. ""Botswana has become the center for safaris on horseback, while Malawi and Zambia are emerging for the underwater wildlife experience,"" he says. Wade too is also noticing growth in regions that were once considered off-limits. ""Angola is getting up there, and Rwanda is starting to pay attention. It's still in its infancy there, but it will grow fast,"" she says. A taste of the continent . Wade says there is an incredible opportunity for new properties to embrace the numerous healing traditions and natural ingredients indigenous in the continent. Her product line, which boasts Senegalese black seed oil, is one of the few to do so, but Wade is hoping it's a trend that will spread. ""There are 54 countries in Africa, and each of these has dozens upon dozens of different healing rituals. There is a richness and diversity that we need to tap into,"" she says. So far only a handful of brands have taken a similar track -- such as the South African spa brand Healing Earth, which incorporates local ingredients like Kalahari melon or mongongo nut. Wade worries about the implications if more don't follow suit: . ""If we're not careful, the wellness industry will come and put a blanket over what we already have. They'll bring the Asian- and European-inspired traditions they already know, and what we've had for thousands of years will be lost,"" she warns.","Africa has a multitude of healing traditions and ingredients .
The spa industry in Africa is soaring. It's the fastest growing market for wellness tourism .

"Zhuhai, Guangdong Province (CNN)Zhuhai's Air Show has always been a venue for surprises, usually first-time showings of advanced Chinese military hardware. China's pathologically secretive defense industry normally shows nothing official of its weapons programs to anyone, which makes the biennial Zhuhai expo the only chance to see what its weapons makers have been up to. Much has been written in the past few years about China's defense sector developing increasingly more capable weapons systems that approach the capability of their U.S. and European analogues. Some Chinese weapons, such as a full range of anti-ship and air-to-surface missiles, seem to show that its military -- the People's Liberation Army (PLA) -- is equipped to challenge U.S. Navy carrier battle groups and potentially deny the U.S. the ability to operate in certain areas of the Pacific. But questions remain about how battle-ready the PLA is and whether it can function in a modern, network-centric warfare environment. Today's battlefield operates on the premise that autonomy should be pushed down to the lowest level -- even down to the man in the field -- because time is of the essence. Getting inside of the enemy's ""decision loop"" is the key to victory. But, giving individual units the ability to make their own tactical decisions without their orders being delivered from several layers up the chain of command is an anathema to the ""control uber alles"" mentality of the Chinese leadership. In terms of new weapons, the number one attraction at Zhuhai this year was the new Shenyang FC-31 fighter.  It has generated a good deal of excitement as it's the first time a new Chinese military aircraft has been unveiled while still in the early stages of development -- we usually have to wait until after they start serving in the PLA's air force. The FC-31 is designed to look like a stealth fighter aircraft in the class of the American Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.  It is also the second, but smaller, stealth-type design to be developed by China. The FC-31's ""Big Brother,"" the Chengdu J-20, first flew in January 2011 but has been shrouded in secrecy ever since. The FC-31 ""looks"" stealthy and its shape mimics that of the F-35 in some respects.  But it is impossible to tell just how successful the Shenyang design team has been in developing an aircraft with a low radar cross section without knowing the materials used, the placement of the engines inside the aircraft, and how well the heat signature from the engines has been suppressed by the design of the exhaust nozzle section. Like other PLAAF fighter aircraft, the FC-31 is powered by Russian-made jet engines, in this case two Klimov RD-93 models, which are a specialized variant of the same engine that powers the famous Mikoyan ""MiG-29.""  There have been rumors that a team of renegade designers from the Mikoyan bureau in Moscow assisted Shenyang in the development of the aircraft, but a senior MiG official stated ""no, as far as I know they [the Chinese] completed this design themselves, and they seem to have done a good job on their own."" The MiG official may be correct.  An aircraft of this type designed with Russian assistance would probably perform better. The FC-31's flight routine shows that it ""bleeds"" too much energy -- so when it enters into a turn it begins to lose altitude. Even during straight and level flight the pilot has to engage the engine's afterburners in order to keep the aircraft from sinking to a lower altitude. These are defects in the aircraft's aerodynamic design that a Russian design team would not have made. Western aerospace analysts point out that the FC-31 flown at Zhuhai is a ""clean"" jet in that it is not armed, which means that an aircraft configured for a real mission and fitted with weapons would be even heavier and would perform even worse. So, why has the PLAAF chosen to exhibit an aircraft that is either overweight, underpowered or both? It could be an oblique signal to Washington timed to coincide with President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing for the APEC summit. The underlying message: ""China is stronger than you think."" This would not be the first such example of China trying to use its defense industry to flex its muscles.  In January 2011, when the J-20 first flew, then-U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates was in Beijing for an official visit.  His read was that the timing of the two events was in no way coincidental. Unfortunately for the PLA, the gesture falls flat. Many would have been more impressed by the FC-31 in photos posted on Chinese websites than after seeing it actually fly at the air show. Looks can be deceiving, as they say.","Air show provides rare glimpse of China's home-grown military hardware .

"Byblos, Lebanon (CNN) -- The ancient town of Byblos has long been a draw for visitors to Lebanon's picturesque west coast. Home to a fascinating history, it is believed to have been the first Phoenician city and can be dated as far back as 7000 BC. But these days Byblyos (or Jbeil as it is more commonly known in Arabic) dances to a very different tune. Every summer a 600 strong production crew comes together to put on the Byblos International Festival (BIF), transforming the Mediterranean town into an unlikely haven for music lovers. This year's event witnessed a record number of artists on stage in one night -- a testament to how popular and ambitious the event has become. ""Lebanon and this particular venue, for those who have experienced it, has a particular aura,"" said Naji Baz, the festivals producer and artistic director since 2003. For Baz, the festival is a full time job, which he and his core team spend all year working on without pay. It's this passion and commitment that has allowed them to convince international stars like the Gorrillaz, Patti Smith, Snow Patrol and Lana Del Rey to perform at Byblos. ""Artists do talk to each other, so each one who came here over the past 13 years has become our best ambassador."" Artistic roots . BIF first began in the 1960s and ran periodically through the next four decades before becoming an annual fixture since 2003. The spectacular setting backlit by a 12th-century castle has become the event's defining feature. But putting on the show doesn't come without its challenges. ""We're in the site that's 2,500 years old so each time you need to use a hammer, you have to get proper written authorization from the Ministry of Tourism and stuff because it's very much a protected site,"" Baz said. Ancient artifacts aren't the only obstacles. Putting world-renowned artists on show is an expensive business. Baz describes how this year's festival will cost between $4 million and $4.5 million. Sponsors and public funds take care of $1.5 million worth of this cost meaning the extra $3 million must be met ticket sales. Just to break even on expenses, therefore, the event has to sell 40,000 tickets. Whereas most other festivals rely on ticket sales for a third of their income, in Byblos they make up 75% of revenues. Regional unrest . Then there's the difficulty of bringing international musicians and fans to a country that has experienced its fair share of turmoil in recent years. Visitor numbers have been dipping since the war in neighboring Syria began three years ago. ""We're relying almost solely on locals (for ticket sales),"" Baz explained. 2014 headline act Marcel Khalife, a Lebanese singer and composer, led an ensemble of 160 musicians. He spoke of the concerns of his fellow artists on visiting and performing in his country. ""I always play with large orchestras around the world,"" Khalife said. ""However, here in Lebanon in these difficult situations to be able to carry out this sort of work is not easy. ""People come warily because maybe something will happen, an explosion, so it was difficult."" Fortunately for Baz and Khalife, this year's event has been a success despite all of the difficulties entailed with staging such a sizable event in this part of the world. ""We're achieving our quantitative goals year after year because Lebanon has got a strong middle class and a strong need for cultural events,"" Baz said . But after all the drama and the stress of ensuring everything goes off without a hitch, there is now another pressing concern for the indefatigable organizers. How to begin preparing for next year.","Byblos International Festival attracts music lovers from across the world .

"Willem-Alexander was sworn in as the first Dutch king in more than 120 years on Tuesday after his mother, Queen Beatrix, abdicated the throne, ending 33 years as the country's monarch. The 75-year-old monarch handed over power in a constitutionally ordained ceremony in the Mozes Hall of the royal palace in Amsterdam. The transfer became official as she signed the ""instrument of abdication"" that means she will now be known as Princess Beatrix. Cheers erupted from crowds gathered outside the palace who were watching proceedings on a big screen as the queen signed the document. CNN's Max Foster reported that many in the Netherlands had been partying well into the night. Thousands of well-wishers, many of them wearing orange wigs, T-shirts and hats, flooded down Damrak towards the center of the city. Lots of flags were waving, saying ""Dag Beatrix"" on one side and ""Hallo Willem-Alexander"" on the other. Church bells rang out across the city as the family appeared on the balcony of the royal palace and people in the square waved flags and blew horns. ""I'm happy and grateful to present you your new King Willem-Alexander,"" Beatrix told the crowd. King Willem-Alexander told the crowd he was ""grateful for your confidence and support"" as he started his reign and thanked his mother for ""33 touching and inspiring years."" iReport: Happy faces as crowds applaud new king . Beatrix stepped down on the national holiday known as Queen's Day, an opportunity for people across the Netherlands to dress up and party. The investiture during which the new king took the oath of office before a joint session of parliament was the high point of a year of celebrations marking the end of the Napoleonic occupation in 1813. Before taking his oath, the king thanked his mother for the ""many beautiful years during which she was our queen."" ""Dear mother, he said, ""remained calm in difficult times and stayed her course,"" he said. ""I'm treading in your footsteps but no one knows what the future brings,"" he said. The king swore ""to preserve the independence and territory of the kingdom to the best of my ability ... so help me God."" Beatrix announced her abdication in January, saying it was time for a new generation to lead. ""I have always considered it as an extraordinary privilege to be able to put a big part of my life at the service of our country and in accordance with my task to add substance to my kingship,"" said Beatrix, who acceded to the throne when her mother, Queen Juliana, abdicated in 1980. ""Until today, this beautiful task has given me a lot of satisfaction. It is inspiring to feel close to people, to sympathize in grievances and share times of joy and national pride."" The Dutch media has speculated that the queen was abdicating to spend more time with her second son Friso, who was injured in an avalanche at an Austrian ski resort last year. He remains in a coma in a London hospital. In a televised address Monday night, Beatrix said she knew the new royal couple would have the loving trust of the nation. ""My oldest son will now take over a beautiful task which is filled with great responsibility,"" she said.  ""I am absolutely convinced that Willem-Alexander will be committed in faithful devotion to be a good king and to do what a good King is asked to do."" A king for the 21st century . The 46-year-old new king was educated in Wales and Holland, where he earned a history degree at Leiden University. He served in the Dutch Royal Navy from 1985 to 1987.  As Prince of Orange -- the title given to the person first in line to the Dutch throne -- he was interested in sustainability and innovation. He is married to Máxima, who was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. She has a degree in economics and has worked for HSBC and Deutsche Bank. The couple have been married for 11 years and have three daughters. Last week, the couple gave their first joint TV interview in which Willem set out how he intended to rule. ""I want to be a king who is first of all traditional, built on the tradition of my predecessors, who stands for continuity and also for stability in the country ... but also a king who in the 21st century can bind together and represent society as a whole."" Asked how he intended to do that, Willem told the NOS state broadcaster: ""By being present where you think people need support or help, by giving extra attention and presence to worthwhile events and by supporting people who are in need."" Notable absence . One notable absence at Tuesday's ceremony was the new queen's father, Jorge Zorreguieta, who was a minister during the 1976-1983 Argentinian military dictatorship. Maxima said her family would not attend her swearing-in as queen because of her father's controversial past. ""This is a constitutional event, when my husband becomes king and my father doesn't belong there, especially if there are issues,"" the princess told NOS. ""He remains my father, we still enjoy our private moments."" READ MORE: Why Elizabeth isn't abdicating .","Willem-Alexander is first Dutch king in more than 120 years .

"(CNN) -- The Pennsylvania official was just talking about one area, but he summed up a winter storm that struck much of the eastern United States on Wednesday. ""We dodged a bullet,"" said Steve Cowan, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. As night fell, travelers and transportation authorities breathed a collective sigh of relief as the worst of holiday travel fears failed to materialize. The storm caused some complications and inconveniences, but no major delays or breakdowns. Forecasters see mostly smooth sailing into Thanksgiving. CNN meteorologist Todd Borek predicted some lake-effect snowfall over the Great Lakes and fresh snow from a weak disturbance for the Upper Midwest. But, he added: ""The worst in terms of widespread snow and rain is over. Tomorrow will be a quieter day, although wind gusts will continue to be a problem overnight and Thursday for the Northeast."" That's good news for people like Latasha Abney, who joined the more than 43 million Americans expected by AAA to travel over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Abney said Wednesday that she arrived more than two hours early at Washington's Reagan National Airport to catch a flight to New York's JFK. ""I thought the lines were going to be ridiculous,"" she said in an e-mail. ""I was second in line checking my bag with Delta (checked into my flight last night) and security was a breeze. I walked right up, the TSA agent checked my info and I immediately started the security process. And now the wait begins. It's pretty quiet by the gates. Not too many people roaming around. So far, so good! Happy Thanksgiving!!!!"" Brian M. Good said he, too, was expecting a horrible trip when he departed New York for Newark to get a flight to San Diego. ""Instead the roads were dead,"" he said in an e-mail. ""It's warm outside and it stopped raining. No lines at the airport and flight is on time. Wish the forecasters were wrong all the time :)"" Will winds whip parade balloons? Though the worst of the storm has passed, winds could still pose a problem. The forecast has left up in the air the fate of the balloons in Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. They are to be grounded if sustained winds reach 23 mph or gusts exceed 34 mph -- both slightly above predicted strength. A decision will be made Thursday morning before the parade's 9 a.m. ET scheduled start. ""Tomorrow before the event, we'll make a determination -- the police department, the incident commander -- whether the balloons will fly or not,"" Patrol Chief James Hall with the New York Police Department said Wednesday. ""It looks good. It looks very good,"" he said about the possibility of balloons in the air. But there is ample reason to support the caution. In 1997, a woman spent more than three weeks in a coma after the Cat in the Hat balloon -- tossed by heavy winds -- struck a pole that hit her. In 2005, two other people were hurt in a similar incident involving the M&Ms balloon. Officials say that improved weather monitoring devices en route and a police sergeant assigned to each balloon will minimize any danger. ""We came all the way from Puerto Rico to see the parade, so it will be a disappointment if we don't see the balloons,"" said Jose Ramirez, who was in New York with his family. Either way, the parade -- with or without the balloons -- will go on, organizers say. Planes, trains ... Delays were reported at several airports in the Northeast on Wednesday. Don't get trapped by bad Thanksgiving weather: Top tips . Heavy winds at all three New York-area airports -- LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy and Newark-Liberty -- resulted in delays of 30 minutes to an hour, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Departure delays from Philadelphia International Airport averaged nearly two hours. American Airlines' Kent Powell reported three cancellations, none of them related to the weather. At US Airways, Todd Lehmacher called the impact of the weather ""pretty minimal, at this point,"" with six weather-related cancellations and an on-time performance of about 67%. The impact was more pronounced at US Airways Express, which tallied 56 cancellations because of the weather, he said. ""The real story is people are getting to their destinations, albeit a little delayed in some but not all cases,"" he said. #ATL24: A day in the life of the world's busiest airport . Amtrak reported no major delays systemwide. Using the weather as a marketing tool, the nation's rail system was adding seats on some routes. ""Rail travel remains one of the most reliable and comfortable transportation options, especially in weather conditions that negatively impact other modes,"" Amtrak said. There may be something to that. ""QUIET CAR. Window seat. Polite seatmate. I have hit the Amtrak travel trifecta. #blessed,"" Ellie Hall tweeted early Wednesday. 5 healthy eating tips for holiday travelers . ... and automobiles . Snow blanketed parts of the Midwest, where crews scrambled to clear roads. The storm was blamed for scores of accidents. Up to a foot of snow fell in parts of Pennsylvania, and it was falling from upstate New York into Canada, where more than a foot was possible. Snow also continued to fly in the central Appalachians and around the Great Lakes as cold air moved in and produced lake-effect snows. Road conditions were not great in much of the Northeast. ""It's sleet; it's rain; it's 31 degrees. It's ugly out there,"" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. Still, a call for anecdotes elicited a number of comments, but no horror stories. ""Well, since the forecast said we would be hitting an ice storm on our way, we ended up leaving the night before we had planned and took an alternate route,"" Sarah Martini said in an e-mail. ""This morning we took smaller roads to avoid DC traffic and have made great progress! We managed to avoid bad weather and traffic and are getting close to getting to Pittsburgh from NC!"" The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that 416 motorists died during Thanksgiving weekend last year, that 60% of the dead had not been wearing seat belts and that 42% of the accidents involved a drunken driver. Last week, 12 people died, most of them in car crashes, when one of the fronts making up the current storm iced roads from the Rockies to Texas and Oklahoma. More than 100 vehicles ended up in wrecks. ""I get on the highway, and the next thing I know I'm spinning,"" said Seqret Watson, among the dozens of drivers in Northwest Arkansas sent sliding when their cars hit icy bridges and roads. ""I try to grab my wheel and then I just hit the wall. Just jumped out to make sure my kids were OK,"" Watson told affiliate KFSM. The Peterson family had initially planned to drive from Northern Virginia to Massachusetts. But after seeing the forecast, they booked seats on a flight at the last minute. ""It was a small fortune,"" Jennifer Peterson told CNN affiliate WUSA. ""We could've gone to the Bahamas for what we paid!"" Storm prompts airlines to relax travel policies .

"English football fans have been warned they face criminal prosecution if they continue to chant a word which has been deemed anti-Semitic. The English Football Association (FA) have told fans to stop using the word ""Yid"", a term which at different times throughout history has been used by Jews and also to abuse them. Tottenham Hotspur, a north London-based club, are known for having a large number of Jewish supporters. A section of Spurs fans have attempting to reclaim the ""Y word"" by referring to themselves as the ""Yid Army"" and chanting it at matches. But the FA has warned that such practices are no longer acceptable as it continues its fight against discrimination in the English game. ""We are committed to tackling discrimination in all its forms and that includes anti-Semitic behavior in football,"" FA general secretary Alex Horne said in a statement. ""The Y-word has no place in our game and its use in stadiums can result in a football banning order.  We are determined that everyone can enjoy football in a fan friendly and safe environment."" The FA also stated that, while it understands the motives of fans attempting to reclaim an offensive term, it still deems the word a discriminatory slur. ""The FA appreciates that language is a complex issue: the use and meaning of words is constantly evolving,"" read a statement. ""This means that, over time, sometimes neutral words or phrases can come to be understood as offensive; and, similarly, words or phrases previously considered as offensive can become more acceptable. ""Although the term derives from the Yiddish word for a Jew, its use in the English language has been, both historically and in contemporary use, derogatory and offensive. ""It is noted that many minority communities have sought to reclaim historic terms of abuse such as this as a means of empowerment.  The process of empowerment through reclaiming language is complex and can often divide opinion within the same community. ""In light of the historic and contemporary use of the term, The FA considers that the use of the term 'Yid' is likely to be considered offensive by the reasonable observer."" Speaking on behalf of Maccabi GB, a British charity aimed at promoting Jewish participation in sports, Dave Rich declared the word does not have a place in modern language due to its associations with fascist views of Oswald Mosley, a politician during the early decades of the 20th century. ""The Y-word causes offense to many people, Jewish and non-Jewish, however it is intended,"" said Rich. ""Its historic association with Mosley's fascists and continued use by antisemites outside football mean that it has no place in football grounds or anywhere else."" Raymond Simonson, chief executive of the Jewish Community Center in London, says he has no problem with fellow Tottenham fans using the word, although he cannot bring himself to say it out loud. He told CNN World Sport: ""I've had that word spat at me in the street, had the word scrawled over my exercise book at school and been held up by the scruff of my neck and had that word shouted at me. ""That word has a lot of meaning for me and it's the reason I can't say the word. ""The problems with words which have racist connotations is that it's about context. ""When I go to football matches and I have to listen to fans, a minority mind you, hissing to make the sounds of the gas chambers,I don't believe anybody can tell me the reason they do it is because some Spurs fans are singing a song about Jermain Defoe which rhymes with the ''y"" word."" Tottenham explained how the uses of the term by their fans was a ""defense mechanism"" rather than a deliberate attempt to insult the Jewish community. ""Last season saw a number of incidents where fans were targeted by allegedly far-right activists on the continent and subjected to anti-Semitic abuse by opposition fans,"" said a club spokesman. ""Subsequently, the debate on this issue has two key considerations. ""Firstly, whether or not its use now plays a role in deflecting or attracting unjustified abuse, abuse that is inexcusable on any grounds; and secondly, whether it is liable to cause offense to others even if unintentionally.  Our fans have themselves engaged in this debate following the events of last season. ""We recognize that this is a complex debate and that, in the interests of encouraging a positive and safe environment for all supporters, consideration should be given to the appropriateness and suitability of its continued use. ""We are already in the process of engaging with our fans and shall be consulting more widely in due course."" But Peter Herbert, chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers, believes Tottenham supporters must take more responsibility in tackling the issue. ""We're not blaming Spurs fans,"" he told CNN World Sport. ""But they have to take responsibility. Those same fans would not dare use that word on a Saturday afternoon outside the ground. You cannot have an area of London which is ring fenced for racism or anti-Semitism."" In recent years, the FA has shown its sensitivity to the concerns of the English football's Jewish community. The England national team paid a visit to the World War II concentration camp Auschwitz I in Berkanau ahead of the Euro 2012 tournament in Poland and Ukraine last year. In October, England manager Roy Hodgson will open the ""Four Four Jew"" exhibition at the Jewish Museum London. The exhibition celebrates the Jewish community's contribution to British football.","English football fans could face criminal charges for using an offensive term .

"Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh was admitted Sunday to a military hospital in Sanaa, the second time that he's been to a hospital this month, a government official said. Saleh led Yemen for 30 years before stepping down, amid widespread protests as well as international pressure, last November as part of a long discussed deal brokered the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council. He suffered extensive burns and a collapsed lung in a June 2011 strike on the mosque in Yemen's presidential compound, a U.S. government official said then. In subsequent months, he has gotten continued medical treatment in various places, including in Saudi Arabia and New York. The Yemeni official said Sunday that Saleh was in the hospital for ""a scheduled checkup, not an emergency,"" while acknowledging he continues to face health issues. There are ""concerns from Saleh's staff that he still needs more medical procedures and treatment,"" the government official said. Since leaving office last year, Saleh has remained a force in Yemeni politics. That includes threatening this March to withdraw all members of the nation's ruling party, which he still heads, from the national government and warning Prime Minister Mohammed Saleh Basendowah he could face imprisonment. The leaders of the current government have expressed support for extensive reforms, while Basendowah attended a ceremony at Change Square in Sanaa and condemned the old regime's attacks against unarmed youth protesters. New al Qaeda video rails against Yemen's president . U.S. President Barack Obama issued an executive order last Wednesday targeting ""those who threaten the peace, security, or stability of Yemen,"" including by obstructing implementation of the transition agreement. The new order allows the U.S. Treasury Department to freeze U.S.-based assets of anyone who might subsequently be listed under the order. While no specific entity was named, it is widely believed to be aimed at the former president's circle.","Ex-President Ali Abdullah Saleh is admitted to a military hospital in Sanaa, an official says .

"Looking slightly wan but smiling, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, left a hospital Thursday morning, three days after being admitted for acute morning sickness. She emerged from the hospital accompanied by her husband, Prince William, and carrying a bouquet of yellow roses, and was driven away by a waiting car. A St. James's Palace spokesman said: ""The Duchess of Cambridge has been discharged from the King Edward VII Hospital and will now head to Kensington Palace for a period of rest.‬‪ . ""Their Royal Highnesses would like to thank the staff at the hospital for the care and treatment the Duchess has received."" On her way out, Catherine acknowledged the crowd of reporters who have been camped outside the hospital since she was admitted Monday with hyperemesis gravidarum, a condition that involves nausea and vomiting more severe than the typical morning sickness many women suffer during early pregnancy. Her hospitalization prompted the early announcement of her pregnancy. Opinion: Pregnancy and privacy . In his first public comments since then, Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, said he was ""thrilled"" by the news. ""It's a very nice thought to become a grandfather in my old age, if I can say so,"" he told reporters in London. ""I'm very glad my daughter-in-law is getting better.  Thank goodness!"" He also made a humorous reference to a story that dominated the UK headlines Wednesday, involving two Australian DJs who made a prank call to the hospital in which they impersonated Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles. ""How do you know I'm not a radio station?"" the prince joked. The hospital said it deeply regretted that the hoax call had been transferred to a ward in the early hours of Tuesday morning and a short conversation was held with one of the nursing staff. The conversation included some general details of the duchess's condition and care, according to audio posted online by the DJs' Sydney-based radio station, 2Day FM. 2Day FM apologized Wednesday for a prank it said was ""done with light-hearted intentions."" The duchess is not yet 12 weeks pregnant, Clarence House told CNN on Monday, so the palace is not announcing a due date for the child. Confirmation of the pregnancy followed months of speculation among royalty-watchers. William and Catherine's child will be next in line to the British throne after William, regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl. Planned changes to the law of succession that end the tradition of a boy taking precedence over an elder sister are already de facto in effect, the British Cabinet Office said. William and Catherine were married at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011, in London's biggest royal wedding in three decades. Their baby would be the first grandchild of Prince Charles and the late Diana, Princess of Wales.","Prince Charles is ""thrilled"" by the prospect of becoming a grandfather .

"The stores that line New York City's Fifth Avenue are filled with mannequins that come to life, DJs huddled over mixing boards and waiters lofting trays of free-flowing Champagne -- a scene lit by blinding flashbulbs. Women pair their Sunday best with heels that would make a podiatrist cringe, as they strut by, ogling the latest handbag collections. For men, it's all about the pocket squares, bow ties and smoking loafers. Fashion's Night Out, which took place last night in New York and across the world, is not for the self-conscious. The streets run rampant with stylish people taking pictures of stylish people taking pictures. Everyone is looking at everyone else -- Tweeting, Facebooking and Instagramming their favorite looks of the night. One can judge the success of their ensemble by the number of times they're asked for a photograph. While that might sound a bit pretentious, and just about as fun as, say, a sewing needle injury, Fashion's Night Out started for a more practical reason: To help the struggling U.S. clothing industry in an era of economic uncertainty. The trademarked event started four years ago, when retail sales were anything but vibrant. By December 2009, retail sales had fallen for six straight months. The #NYFW diet: Part of the job? ""In 2009, in-store traffic was incredibly low, affecting sales and threatening jobs. It was clear that something needed to happen to get people comfortable with shopping again and to remind them that their purchases were helping to support the economy and the lives of those around them that worked in fashion,"" said Susan Portnoy, vice president of media relations at Condé Nast. Condé Nast is the parent company of heavy-hitting fashion publications like Women's Wear Daily, Vogue and GQ. ""We feel that Fashion's Night Out helped to jump-start that thinking then, and each year it serves as a reminder,"" she said. Vogue, the Council of Fashion Designers of America, NYC & Company (New York City's official tourism organization) and the City of New York decided to team up to ""restore consumer confidence"" and ""boost the industry's economy during the recession"" with a one-night celebration of style, but more importantly, commerce. They brought in celebrity meet-and-greets, DJs, free drinks, swag bags and limited-edition, Fashion's-Night-Out branded merchandise. Forty percent of the proceeds from branded products benefit the New York City AIDS Fund in the NY Community Trust. Since 2009, Fashion's Night Out has expanded to 19 countries and more than 500 cities in the U.S. ""In addition to the retailers, this event gives a boost to hotels and restaurants, public transportation and dozens of other industries. In the end, we feel local economies on many different levels benefit,"" said Portnoy. Yuriko Ogura, 22, is visiting from Osaka, Japan, for the event as well as Fashion Week. Ogura, standing out in Rockefeller Center with a bright yellow blazer and black cloche hat, said the event's appeal lies in its accessibility: It's an opportunity for the general public to connect with the seemingly intimidating fashion community on a more personal level. As Katerina Kriticos, a 24-year-old recent graduate from the Fashion Institute of Technology, strolls into the Ted Baker store on Fifth Avenue, she's clearly in her element. The shop is modeled after a London townhouse in the 1920s, and merry women dressed in black and white maid costumes flit about the crowd waiting to enter the store. Spring 2013 Fashion Week: Behind-the-scenes Instagrams . Kriticos, who lives in New Jersey and is an aspiring accessories designer, met her best friend in New York City for the extravaganza. ""It's not only about the inspiration from all around and being in stores and seeing the new line and getting excited for Fashion Week, it's everyone coming together for a good cause,"" she said. Just outside on Fifth Avenue, friends Jason Campbell, 25, Jamel Pearson, 23, and Darnell Barclift, 22, came together to take advantage of the limited time offers, but to also visit friends who work in the retail shops that line the way. ""We always see a little boost in sales due to the increased foot traffic that results from the excitement of the evening,"" said Fiona Zeman, who handles public relations and marketing for Ted Baker. ""It is a wonderful opportunity to welcome in potential new clients and delight them with our unique store environments."" ""It's something fun and exciting to look forward to and everyone is invited. It galvanizes the community around a common love of shopping and fashion in unexpected and creative ways,"" said Portnoy. ""It also provides an excuse to broaden a shopper's horizons by exploring new stores and learning about new designers, plus it's a great excuse to gather with friends and enjoy an evening out on the town."" Further downtown, the air is clouded with cigarette smoke while crowd control barriers line the street to help herd the fashionistas. At designer Nicole Miller's SoHo boutique, assistant manager Fantcha Mendes bops along to the DJ with an enormous smile because, to her, Fashion's Night Out ""encourages people to feel good about themselves."" Wear what you want, own it, and in the words of Madonna, express yourself. Despite all the distractions, she's also smiling because Fashion's Night Out, at least for her boutique, achieved its original goal.

"So where, exactly, is Edward Snowden? President Vladimir Putin knows. But Russia's chief snooper isn't telling. Not exactly, anyway. The ex-KGB officer and master of doublespeak described Snowden as a ""free man"" ( biding his time in a ""transit area"" in Moscow's Sheremetyo airport. So free, of course, that the young American ex-surveillance officer -- watched around the clock by hawkish Russian security agents - has become as ubiquitously and transparently invisible as the brightly lit subject of a dystopian Kafka story. Read more: How to hide your data from Internet . Snowden isn't alone in his fate. The truth is that anyone who uses the Internet is also all in that brightly lit ""transit area."" I'm afraid we are all in danger of becoming Edward Snowden now. ""Mr. Snowden really did fly into Moscow,"" Putin said, with just the glimmer of a secret policeman's smile. ""For us it was completely unexpected."" Oh, yes, it must have been totally unexpected. So unexpected, indeed, that the area between passport control and the arrival gates in Sheremetyo airport has been transformed into a high security hotel designed to both shield Snowden from public view and to watch him. Yes, Sheremetyo is beginning to mirror the Internet, a vast all-seeing digital panopticon, a network in which somebody might be watching everything we do, a place where individual privacy no longer exists. And Snowden's fate -- of being watched around the clock, of having zero privacy  -- could easily become all of our fates. Opinion: In digital age, everyone is becoming a spook . Ironically, it's Snowden himself who has most clearly revealed to us our fate. In secret National Security Agency (NSA) documents which Snowden gave to the Guardian newspaper, we now know that for more than two years, the Obama administration allowed the NSA, to continue -- as the newspaper put it  -- ""collecting vast amounts of records detailing the email and internet usage of Americans."" Doublespeak isn't, of course, unique to the Russian security apparatchik. The Americans are pretty skilled at it too. ""I'm not going to say we're not collecting any internet metadata,"" thus one Obama Adminstration official told the Washington Post. But, as the Guardian notes, the distinction between metadata and data is mostly semantic. The truth is that the NSA has been data-mining us all of us to death -- Americans and foreigners alike -- in their paranoid search for enemies of the American state. Last year I wrote a book warning about this and called it ""Digital Vertigo""  -- in homage to Alfred Hitchcock's nightmarish movie about a San Francisco private eye whose life is destroyed by both surveillance and voyeurism. Some people said I was exaggerating. Now they know I wasn't. By being able to read our emails and Internet usage, by harvesting over a trillion metadata records, the NSA knows absolutely everything about us. They know our tastes, what we think, where we go, what we eat, how we sleep, when we are angry, when we are sad. They have become our eyes and our brains. Hitchcock's 20th century movie about surveillance and voyeurism really has become the truth about 21st century digital life. More from Andrew Keen: Should we fear mind-reading future tech? It's almost as if the agents at the NSA have become as omniscient as Google or Facebook. The really terrifying thing about Snowden's revelations is the doublethink articulated by the Silicon Valley technology companies whose pipes and platforms have been hijacked by the snooping NSA bureaucrats. Google, Facebook and the rest all, of course, claim, in the sophisticatedly obtuse doublespeak of their lawyers, both ignorance and innocence about the NSA allegations. But, as Techcrunch founder Mike Arrington notes, the truth about Silicon Valley's complicity is this horror story is much murkier, much more like the dark transit area in Sheremetyo airport where Vladimir Putin's spooks are monitoring Snowden's every movement. Silicon Valley's fetish with radical transparency, with encouraging us to broadcasting everything we do and think, is destroying our privacy. And without privacy, I warn, our individuality, the very thing that defines us as unique human-beings, is fatally compromised. Snowden's fate, whether he ends up in Ecuador or Guantanamo or stays in Sheremetyo airport, is to be watched by spooks for the rest of his life. Snowden, the ""free man"" in Putin's doublespeak, will never truly be alone again. To avoid becoming Edward Snowden, we need to be much more critical of the invasiveness of Silicon Valley's big data companies. We must recognize the creepiness of all-seeing location devices like Google Glass. Most of all, we need to remember that the Internet is never really private so our most intimate thoughts are best kept to ourselves. Visibility is a trap. Remaining free in our digital age requires us to be alone. We have to teach the internet how to forget. We must build an off-switch to the internet, to reinvent it as a dark space, a place where nobody can know what anyone else is doing.","Snowden is stuck in the transit zone in Moscow, watched by Russian security services .
Keen: Presumably it is his fate to be watched for the rest of his life wherever he ends up .

"(CNN) -- How do you follow a phenomenon like Frankel? It is 18 months in April since one of the greatest horses ever to grace the planet retired in a blaze of glory, with his 14th race win from 14 starts to take his career earnings just shy of £3 million ($5 million). It led to a rating of 147 from Timeform, making him the highest-rated horse since the records began. His trainer Henry Cecil, who passed away last year following a battle with cancer, said of the horse with a top speed of 42 mph: ""He's the best I've ever seen. I'd be very surprised if there's ever been a better horse."" Frankel was once described as a ""lightning strike of genetics, which may not be repeated for 100 years."" Jockey Tom Queally was on board for the duration of his career and likens him to the ""Usain Bolt of horse racing."" ""Really, you can compare him to any of the greats in any sport, in fact in any walk of life and that's him. He was just head and shoulders above everyone else."" Today, Frankel stands in a luxury stable at Banstead Manor Stud in southeast English county of Suffolk, fed and watered and walked out to breed with the world's fastest and most famous horses. The world's wealthiest horse owners pay £125,000 ($210,000) for every impregnation, as they try to unearth the next Frankel. In his first season alone, he covered 133 mares. Queally admits that part of him will be excited to get the opportunity to ride these offspring in future, but he is also under no illusions about the reality of life after Frankel. Following that last race, he asked: ""Everything's going to be an anticlimax after Frankel isn't it?"" In reality, he knew the answer. ""No-one can compare to Frankel, no one will ever compare to him as every moment spent on his back was a special moment,"" the Irishman told CNN. ""There's different eras in different sports and inevitably people will always make comparisons. But I'm a realist, I know I won't ever ride a horse like that again. It'll be fun to ride his impact. I think we'll still see Frankel's impact on horse racing in that regard. I think he'd like the idea he's still making a mark."" Frankel's temperament is not quite like that of some of the great racehorses, who are often jittery, tetchy animals, highly sprung and highly strung. In contrast, Frankel has always been a fairly placid soul. But even a year and a half on from that moment he last delighted packed stands as he ripped up the turf at Ascot to win the Champions Stakes, Queally can still easily recall his majesty. ""He was just a superstar, pure and simple,"" says Queally. ""He had an enormous amount of ability and he just dominated simply because he was far superior to everyone else. He had a lovely temperament and was just very professional in every way imaginable. ""He wasn't that easy to ride to start with -- he had a bit of a hold but he just got easier. I think part of it was down to his intelligence. He was such a quick learner and, by the end of it, I'd just push a button and he'd go. There was never once a time when I thought he'd lose."" Life after Frankel has changed markedly for Queally and those around him. After Cecil passed away, aged 70, Queally -- who had been the official jockey at the trainer's Warren Place stables in Newmarket -- has since opted to go freelance. A once great team has dissipated but Frankel lives on, as does the memory of what he achieved. Queally's home is littered with memories of him, from the trophies to photographs of the pair's famous victories. However, Queally has seen him just once since their final day in action together, but there remains an indelible bond between jockey and horse. ""I know it sounds strange but we got on well,"" he says. ""I'd chat to him a lot when racing, trying to relax him or maybe just me. ""It seemed important as there was always such hype when we raced. I wouldn't say there was pressure as I was always happy on his back, and really I always knew the result."" But the issue for Queally is that he has achieved his career high, at least in terms of the absolute class of the horse that follows him. However, he now distances himself from that earlier ""anticlimax"" comment. ""There's an element of anticlimax in that they'll never be another one like him, but then there's two other parts,"" he explains. ""One is that I was very lucky to have ridden him in the first place but the other thing is that I have other career goals. ""As a freelance rider, you hope to get some top rides. Basically how it works is my agent will get contacted about certain rides and then they get lined up. I still want to compete in the top races immaterial of who I'm riding, to win things like the Derby. ""I'm looking forward to that and, in some ways, winning the races and championships tops what's gone before."" However, one thing he is aware of is that should he ride another trailblazer of the track, the comparisons will inevitably come to the fore. ""I know that the first question I'll be asked about will always be Frankel,"" he says. ""And I'm okay with that.""","It is 18 months since wonder horse Frankel retired from racing .

"A fire that shut down and extensively damaged Nairobi's Kenyatta International Airport -- a major travel hub in Africa that is crucial to Kenya's export industry -- appeared to have restarted early Thursday. CNN Correspondent Nima Elbagir saw smoke behind the arrivals area and a small fire that seemed to be getting bigger. There was no immediate word from authorities about the new fire. Large parts of the international terminal were destroyed by the massive blaze that broke out before dawn Wednesday. The fire engulfed the terminal, Ken Mijungu of CNN affiliate NTV reported, before firefighters got it under control. No casualties were reported. Authorities later said the fire was contained, and domestic flights resumed in the afternoon. Video from NTV in the aftermath showed the burned-out interior of the international arrivals section with the roof caved in. International arrivals were supposed to resume Thursday from a different part of the airport, according to Transport and Infrastructure Cabinet Secretary Michael Kamau, but it wasn't clear how the rekindled fire Thursday morning would affect them. There was no information about when departures would begin. The blaze could have a serious impact on the flow of tourists into the country and the export of agricultural products. Nairobi, Kenya's capital, is a major travel hub in Africa, and fresh fruits and vegetables are exported from there to Europe by plane many times a week. President Uhuru Kenyatta visited the scene Wednesday and reassured the aviation industry and local and international travelers that everything was being done to get back to normal, Secretary of Communications Manoah Esipisu said. ""To the thousands of passengers, including tourists, whose journeys were disrupted, the president shares your concerns and regrets the inconvenience. We are concerned that the incident interrupted travelers' schedules and appreciate that they are being routed to their destinations as soon as is possible,"" Esipisu said in a statement. Some witnesses said the fire began in the customs section, but others said it started in the duty-free area, parts of which were demolished for construction last week, Mijungu reported. ""The cause of the fire is being investigated. There is no reason to speculate at this point. There was no loss of life,"" Esipisu said. The blaze occurred on the 15th anniversary of the fatal terrorist attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. It also came days after the United States issued a worldwide travel alert and closed a number of embassies and consulates in large areas of the Middle East and Africa, though not in Kenya or Tanzania. In the 1998 near-simultaneous attacks, 224 people died and about 4,500 were wounded.","The fire appears to restart early Thursday in the arrivals area .

"(CNN) -- It is not easy to capture a man's life in 152 minutes, let alone a life as illustrious and complex as Nelson Mandela's. For London-born actor Idris Elba, who played the South African leader in the 2013 biopic ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom,"" the task was sure to feel Herculean. ""I could never really articulate what it felt like to play Mandela properly in an interview,"" he admits in a phone conversation with CNN. Though the actor is British, and physically bears little resemblance to the late South African leader, Elba recalls the unexpectedly warm reception he received, particularly from extras on set -- many of whom were locals who lived through the apartheid era. ""South Africa is very embracing. Even though I'm not from South Africa and was about to play Mandela, they still gave me a lot of love,"" he says. By the end of filming, many were even calling him ""Madiba."" The experience, life-changing in many ways, was bound to feel odd. For Elba, the best way to capture not just the man but the feeling of playing him on film, was through music. Next week will see the release of ""Mi Mandela,"" a tribute to Mandela made up of songs written and produced by Elba himself, and performed by a mixture of South African and British talent, including Mumford & Sons, the Mahotella Queens and Maverick Sabre. ""There were various sensations I experienced (playing Mandela), and I could never give an answer I was satisfied with. I think this album represents that answer. It allows me to express the feelings of playing him,"" says Elba. The ""Luther"" actor describes the record as a ""character album,"" and hopes to produce similar projects for the many other roles he's taken on over the years. In this respect, ""Mi Mandela"" is as much about his own journey as it is about Mandela's. In the album's title song -- the only one that Elba performs on -- he has a tongue-in-cheek lyric about the casting choice. ""All the families showed me love, the people wished me well/The whole town wondering how Mandela could be played by Stringer Bell,"" he sings, referring to his breakout role in HBO's ""The Wire."" ""It's the thoughts I was thinking at the time of making that film. Music is a good way to get closer to a character, closer to an actor. It describes the whole journey of playing Mandela. It's better than any picture, any postcard, any script, any autograph from an actor,"" he says. ""I would love to hear a character album from Marlon Brando in 'The Godfather,'"" he admits. ""Just to understand what Marlon was going through at the time of making that film, how he was feeling playing that character. What kind of music would that be? What would it sound like? That would be fascinating for me."" A link to his father . For Elba, playing Mandela had personal resonance as well, as filming for the role coincided with the death of his father. ""I lost both men around the same time,"" Elba confides. ""Mandela reminded me of my dad, and my dad reminded me of him. They were both massive symbols in my life."" Elba describes how his father, a Sierra Leone-born shop steward working out of London's Hackney, fought for the rights of union workers at a time in English history when their plight was particularly arduous (it was Maggie Thatcher's time in power, after all). ""He was always equating himself with Mandela and people like Mandela who were standing up for what they believed in, and I would always succumb to 30-minute lectures about rights,"" he recalls. He co-wrote the song ""Tree,"" which features on the album and is performed by American artists Audra Mae and Cody Chesnutt, partially as a tribute to his father. ""Somebody tell my father, that we are standing by his tree/ And even though we miss him, we are glad that he's set free,"" the lyrics go. ""That song is particularly moving to me,"" says Elba. ""As much as I wrote it for my dad, it relates to Mandela too, even more so now."" Idris Elba's ""Mi Mandela"" is set for release on November 24 .","Actor Idris Elba releases his first album, ""Mi Mandela"" next week .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- All major indicators of violence in Iraq have dropped by between 40 and 80 percent since February 2007, when President Bush committed an additional 30,000 troops to the war there, the Pentagon reported Monday. The quarterly report to Congress noted that the military, political and economic gains made in the five-year-old war remain ""fragile, reversible and uneven,"" and that Islamic jihadists loyal to al Qaeda in Iraq remain capable of high-profile attacks. But civilian deaths have dropped from a peak of nearly 4,000 a month from December 2006 to January 2007 to about 500 a month as of May, and U.S. troop deaths have dropped from 126 in May 2007 to an all-time low of 19 in May 2008. The report cited the emergence of the Sons of Iraq as a major reason for the downturn in civilian-oriented violence and deaths. The groups are made up of an estimated 90,000 Iraqis, often former insurgents, paid by U.S. commanders to help protect neighborhoods and provide intelligence on extremists. U.S. troop deaths and civilian deaths spiked in March, when Iraqis battled militia forces loyal to Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr in Basra. At the end of March, an operation in Sadr City by U.S. and Iraqi forces to clear out insurgents firing rockets into the Green Zone also kept the death toll up, according to the report. But while the death toll went up in March, it remained lower than the numbers that prevailed before the ""surge"" campaign began in early 2007. The next April and May saw a sharp downturn in deaths across the board, the report found. The fighting in Basra and Baghdad was a major test for Iraqi troops. Military officials said the Iraqi operation in Basra initially looked like a failure, but has turned out to be a success as Iraqi troops continue to hold and stabilize the southern city. In ongoing operations in the northern city of Mosul to drive out al Qaeda, Iraqi forces are showing clear signs of independent operational capability with little to no U.S. help, U.S. military officials said. The report suggested those successes are bolstering the ranks: More than 27,000 Iraqis have joined the country's security forces since the last Pentagon report, in March, bringing the total number of Iraqi soldiers and police to about 560,000. Since the March report, the Iraqi government focused on resolving conflicts from Basra and Sadr City that dominated the political and security landscape over the past three months, the report said. The report also said increasing oil export revenues are putting more money into the country for development, reconciliation programs and security. Insurgents continue to strike, however. An attack by a female suicide bomber Sunday in Baquba, which killed a reported 15 people, is one example of instability in regions with a heavy insurgent presence. While death tolls are down, the report highlighted the negative influence Iran is having inside Iraq. The report said Iraq's neighbor ""continues to fund, train, arm and guide"" anti-American ""special groups,"" the U.S. term for splinter factions of al-Sadr's Mehdi Army and other Shiite militants. Iran has denied U.S. allegations it is supporting insurgent factions within Iraq. But U.S. and Iraqi troops have discovered Iranian weapons inside Iraq, including Iranian made roadside bombs -- and during the fighting in Basra, large stashes of Iranian-made weapons were found with manufacture dates on them as recent as this year, according to U.S. military officials. The report said the Iraqi government continues to press the Iranians, who deny blame. May 2008 marked a sharp drop in high-profile attacks from al Qaeda, according to the report. Attacks in May hit a two-year low, about 70 percent lower than the peak in March 2007. The U.S. military said the drop is connected to U.S. and Iraqi operations directed at al Qaeda, but pointed out that in a single day -- April 15 -- a high-profile attack killed more than 150 people.","Pentagon's quarterly report to Congress notes violence reduction .

"A federal judge in New Orleans Tuesday approved a $4 billion plea agreement for criminal fines and penalties against oil giant BP for the 2010 Gulf oil spill, the largest criminal penalty in U.S. history. U.S. District Court Judge Sarah Vance imposed the terms that the Justice Department and BP had agreed to last November, which include the oil company pleading guilty to 14 criminal counts -- among them, felony manslaughter charges -- and the payment of a record $4 billion in criminal penalties over five years. Vance's ruling came after hearing from eight witnesses Tuesday, including family members of those killed, cleanup workers, and members of the Southeast Asian Fisherfolks Association. Transocean to pay $1.4 billion for role in Gulf oil spill . The plea agreement is with the oil company and not with indicted individual employees, so it doesn't result in anyone going to jail. Two high-ranking supervisors on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig have been indicted on 23 counts, including manslaughter, for allegedly ignoring warning signs of a possible blowout on the rig. It caught fire April 20, 2010, resulting in the deaths of 11 workers. Those separate criminal cases remain in litigation. Luke Keller, a vice president of BP America, Inc., apologized again in court Tuesday for his company's role in the accident. ""We -- and by that I mean the men and the women of the management of BP, its board of directors, and its many employees -- are deeply sorry for the tragic loss of the 11 men who died and the others who were injured that day,"" said Keller. ""Our guilty plea makes clear, BP understands and acknowledges its role in that tragedy, and we apologize -- BP apologizes -- to all those injured and especially to the families of the lost loved ones. BP is also sorry for the harm to the environment that resulted from the spill, and we apologize to the individuals and communities who were injured."" The London-based oil giant also agreed to pay $525 million over three years to settle claims with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the company concealed information from investors. The oil firm has not agreed with the Justice Department on a separate civil settlement involving federal and state claims of damages to natural resources.  At stake are potential fines for violations of the Clean Water Act, which could range from $5 billion to almost $20 billion if BP is found guilty of gross negligence or willful misconduct.  That case is being heard by another federal court in New Orleans. According to Justice Department officials, $1.3 billion of the $4 billion fine will go to the government, nearly $2.4 billion will go to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and $350 million will go to the National Academy of Sciences.

"In many ways, the 2012 election was the year of the woman. Women — who have historically formed one of President Barack Obama's key constituencies — once again united behind him in large numbers and helped fend off defections from white male and independent supporters. A record 20 women will hold U.S. Senate seats next year—including newly-elected Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin, the first openly lesbian senator. The New Hampshire congressional delegation will be all female and, in Obama's home state of Hawaii, Democrat Mazie Hirono will represent the islands in the Senate. ""I'm not sure if it was as much a coincidence as a perfect storm,"" said Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor with the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. ""The conditions were right and the Republican nominee gave women pause."" According to CNN's exit polls, 55% of women and 45% of men voted for Obama and 44% of women and 52% of men voted for Romney. That level of female support for the president made an especially big impact in swing states like Ohio where the gender breakdown mirrored the national figures. Big gains for women in 2012 . It is a gender advantage Obama clinched even as early as mid October when data showed that among white women, the president led 52%-46%. Back in 2008 when Obama carried Ohio, he received 47% of votes from white women in that state. Nationally, Obama received 56% of the female vote in 2008. ""I think it's one of the things Republicans have to look at,"" Duffy said. ""'Why are we the party of white men.'"" Political experts also say Romney, who saw an early October surge of support among female voters, may have undone those gains during the second presidential debate when he said he used ""whole binders full of women"" as a hiring tool as governor, whiffed on an equal pay question, and alluded to helping women get home to cook dinner. ""That a presidential candidate in 2012 can utter such superficial answers to a serious question about women's economic equity and autonomy reveals a lack of serious thought about issues of substantive importance to women,"" Kathleen Dolan, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin, and Jennifer L. Lawless, an associate professor of government and director of the Women & Politics Institute at American University, wrote recently for CNN. ""It also demonstrates a lack of commitment to the change necessary to allow women and men to lead fully integrated professional and personal lives,"" they said. But Republican woes with women cannot be blamed solely on Romney. Opinion: Women gain wider access to power . Verbal gaffes from down-ballot candidates such as Rep. Todd Akin, whose comments about a woman's body preventing pregnancy after ""legitimate rape"" may have cost him the election, also reinforced for some voters concerns that the GOP is out of touch with women. ""Part of the reason Democrats had a good day was some conservative Republicans said some stupid things and it made some issues more salient than they usually are,"" said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta. ""When people are making comments about legitimate rape ... it scares women who might not have thought about it. Even the conversation about contraception ... this was a way to make women's health issues very, very personal,""  Gillespie said. The first portion of this year's political season saw a heated partisan showdown over a federal mandate requiring religious institutions to offer contraception insurance coverage to employees. The ensuing back and forth sparked a ""war on women"" fight between Democrats and Republicans that bled into congressional hearings, the campaigns and talk radio and re-ignited the gender wars. Democrats were able to use the rhetoric to suggest that Republicans would threaten the right to contraception—something studies indicate the majority of the public supports, said Michele Swers, a Georgetown University American government professor. Move over boys, New Hampshire goes to the women . ""The debate can be more framed on the aspects of the debate that were more popular with the general public,"" Swers said, adding that Democrats were also able to connect other GOP positions on abortion as extreme. There are some indications that social issues directly impacting women might have helped sway votes in some states. Tuesday's early exit polls showed 51% of Missouri voters said they believed abortion should be legal all or most of the time. Of those voters, exit polls showed 76% supported Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill, who won Tuesday night, while 19% voted for Akin. Forty-seven percent of Missouri's voters said abortion should be illegal. Exit polls showed Akin netted 67% of this group's votes while 27% of people who think abortion should be illegal supported McCaskill. But much more than social issues, pocketbook economic issues most concerned women voters, exit polling showed. ""Women like all voters felt the economics were most important,"" Swers said. ""Women tend to be more supportive of government spending (such as cutting things as Medicaid, and food stamps) than men are ... so they were less responsive to Romney in that way and more responsive to Obama's message on empathy and helping the middle class.""","Women were seen as the key to the election this week .
