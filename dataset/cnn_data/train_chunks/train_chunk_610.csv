An NYPD officer shot dead his wife and then took his own life in the Queen's area of New York last night . An off-duty policeman shot and killed his wife before turning the gun on himself in Queens, New York, last night. Police said the 33-year-old officer chased his wife outside their home in the St Albans area and shot her dead in front of a neighbor's house. He is said to have used a shotgun to shoot her four times at around before shooting himself dead. The officer's 46-year-old wife, who also worked for the NYPD as a school safety agent, was said to be wearing her work uniform at the time of the shooting. She was rushed to Queens General Hospital but died shortly afterwards. Her husband was found inside the couple's home by police shortly afterwards, reportedly with a gunshot wound to his head. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The area was cordoned off last night as police and forensics investigators worked to piece together what had happened. A neighbor told CBS New York: 'I just heard, like, about four big booms, and I went to the back and I didn’t see anything, and about 10 minutes later, I saw about four police trucks come in, and she said she heard smoke – this is my friend just coming back to the store. She said she smelled smoke, and she heard big, four booms.' Police recovered a gun but said that it was not the police officer's standard issue weapon and that they are not sure where the firearm came from. According to the New York Post, he had his police issue weapon confiscated following a previous domestic incident. The couple's eight-year-old son, who has not been named, was found unhurt at a relative's house.

China could spy on British citizens and firms through its supply of broadband equipment to UK telecoms giants, Parliament’s intelligence watchdog has warned. MPs on the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) said they had serious concerns about the internet deals signed by BT and O2 with the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei. China could ‘intercept covertly or disrupt traffic passing through Huawei-supplied networks’, their report said, adding that oversight of the firm in the UK is ‘feeble’ and suffers from the ‘absence of any strategy’. Security risk: Chinese hackers could use weaknesses in equipment sold to British firms as an espionage opportunity, MPs said . Huawei supplies mobile handsets, . routers and equipment in telephone exchanges and street cabinets to a . string of British telecoms companies. So scathing was the report that George . Osborne, the Chancellor, yesterday took the unusual step of issuing a . statement in response to the ISC’s findings, stressing the importance of . Chinese investment in Britain. Clearly anticipating a diplomatic row, . he said: ‘Inward investment is critical to generating UK jobs and . growth. It is a personal priority of mine to increase trade links . between the UK and China and I cannot emphasise enough that  the UK is . open to Chinese investment.’ The MPs’ report even called for staff . from the GCHQ listening agency to take over the running of Huawei’s . cyber security evaluation centre which it built in Banbury, Oxfordshire. Failings: The Intelligence and Security Committee, chaired by Sir Malcolm Rifkind, said government action to address concerns had been unaccceptable . Huawei secured a contract with BT . eight years ago as part of the £2.5billion super-fast broadband deal to . supply two-thirds of British homes and companies by 2015.  The Chinese . firm has also signed  deals with O2, TalkTalk and EverythingEverywhere. National security concerns were . sidelined in favour of money as the Chinese had managed to undercut . local companies for the contracts, the report said. Members of the ISC were ‘shocked’ that . ministers were not even informed about the BT deal until a year after . it was signed. Chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind said: ‘Such a sensitive . decision with potentially damaging implications should have been handed . to ministers. A lack of clarity around procedures, responsibility and . powers means that national security issues have risked, and continue to . risk, being overlooked.’ Ahead of the report’s publication, . members of the committee had warned that it would be heavily censored . because of the Treasury and Number 10’s fears of scaring away Chinese . investors – claims denied by Downing Street. Relations with China have been . strained since David Cameron agreed to meet the Dalai Lama, Tibet’s . spiritual leader, last year. Granting him an audience was seen by . Beijing as a terrible snub to China’s sovereignty over Tibet. In its last annual report, the ISC . said that a fifth of detected cyber attacks against the UK were so . sophisticated that they had to be state sponsored or part of an . organised crime ring. China is often cited as one of  the main perpetrators of state- sponsored cyber attacks. Suspicions: Questions have been raised about whether Huawei's intentions were 'strictly commercial or are more political' A spokesman for Huawei said it was . ‘willing to work with all governments in a completely open and . transparent manner to jointly reduce the risk of cyber security.’ In a statement BT said: ‘Security is at the heart of BT and it will continue to be so in the future. ‘Our testing regime enables us to . enjoy constructive relationships with many suppliers across the globe. One of these is Huawei, with whom we have had a long and constructive . relationship since 2005.’","Intelligence and Security Committee raises concerns about Huawei .

Fall: George Michael was airlifted to hospital after tumbling out of his chauffeur-driven Range Rover on the M1 last month . George Michael will not face charges after tumbling from his chauffeur-driven Range Rover onto a busy motorway, police confirmed today. The singer, 49, was airlifted to hospital after falling from the back seat of the car as it hurtled along in the fast lane of the northbound M1 at St Albans on May 16. Michael - said to have fallen out accidentally as he tried to open and shut a passenger door that wasn't properly closed - gave a statement to police in the wake of the bizarre incident, and Hertfordshire Police today confirmed that no further action would be taken. It is an offence for drivers or passengers not to wear a seatbelt where one is fitted. A spokeswoman for the force told MailOnline: 'We're not taking any further action against anybody in the vehicle.' George Michael's driver and another passenger travelling in the vehicle at the time were also spoken to by police about the incident. Speculation was rife following the singer's fall last month, which saw motorway drivers forced to brake and swerve to avoid Michael as he fell onto the carriageway. Eyewitnesses described seeing the musician bounce several times along the carriageway after hitting the tarmac. Some reports suggested Michael had in fact thrown himself from the vehicle - a claim that was branded 'absurd' by friends of the pop star. Representatives for the former Wham heart-throb said in a statement after the fall that Michael was being treated for cuts and bruises but was 'fine'. While a statement on his website said his injuries were 'superficial', Michael spent almost two weeks in hospital before being discharged. Scene: The bizarre incident brought rush hour traffic on the northbound M1 to a halt last month . After the incident driver Katherine Fox, 23, from Dunstable in Bedfordshire, described how she was forced to slam on her brakes to avoid hitting the star as he fell out of the car, and said the 49-year-old was lucky to be alive. Miss Fox said she reversed her mini to shield Michael from oncoming traffic following his fall, which she said left him covered in blood with his tracksuit top torn to shreds. She said the singer looked 'terrible' as he lay on the third of four lanes on the busy stretch of motorway, adding: 'There was so much blood on his face that I didn't recognise him.' Following his release from hospital on May 28 a statement on his website thanked fans for their messages of support. 'We can confirm that George Michael has been discharged from hospital and continues to rest and recuperate,' it said.","Singer was airlifted to hospital after tumbling from car onto the M1 .

Policy disarray: Labour Party Leader Ed Miliband said he would not reverse the coalition's cuts to child benefit for the better off . Ed Miliband vowed yesterday to slash the cost of welfare without cutting the size of benefits. In a speech designed to convince voters that Labour can be trusted with the welfare system, he vowed to cap the overall costs of the social security system. Mr Miliband admitted that the last Labour government got benefits wrong by letting incapacity payments run out of control. But his attempts to turn the page were denounced as ‘vacuous’ after he failed to name a single new benefit that he would cut. He simply repeated Monday’s announcement that Labour would take away winter fuel benefit from wealthier pensioners – a proposal which would cut just £100million from the benefits budget. The Tories pointed out that Mr Miliband has opposed £83billion in benefit cuts during this Parliament. The Labour leader also said ‘I don’t agree’ that his party spent too much money during its time in office. Repeatedly questioned on where he would find welfare savings, he would not commit to back the Government’s decision to limit benefits rises to 1 per cent or ditch his opposition to the Coalition’s cuts to the spare room subsidy, better known as the bedroom tax, which cuts housing benefit when rooms are unoccupied. The Labour leader used a speech in Docklands opposite City Airport in London to make a bold bid to regain the upper hand in the benefits debate . Mr Miliband pledged to cap total spending on welfare, but gave little detail about how it would work in practice . He did not spell out at what level the . cap would be set, or what would happen  if a future Labour government . breached it. Instead, Mr Miliband claimed that he could cut the cost of . welfare by getting more people back to work and driving down the costs . of housing benefit by getting councils to negotiate cheaper rents with . landlords. He told an audience in London’s . Docklands: ‘The next Labour government will have less money to spend. If . we are going to turn our economy around, protect our NHS, and build a . stronger country we will have to be laser-focused on how we spend every . single pound. ‘Social security spending, vital as it . is, cannot be exempt from that discipline.’ He said Labour, if elected, . would introduce a cap on ‘structural spending’ – such as housing . benefit and disability allowances which are not affected by sharp . upturns in unemployment – for three years. Mr Miliband admitted voters’ faith in . the social security system had been ‘shaken’. Kingston Jobcentre: Mr Miliband will call for those who have paid National Insurance for five years to get JobSeeker¿s Allowance of more than £100 a week - compared to £71 now . 'No credible alternative': Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said Mr Miliband is too weak to deliver the tough policies that the country needs . He said: ‘Successive . governments did not do enough to deal with the rise in people on . incapacity benefit. It was a legacy of unemployment from the years Mrs . Thatcher was in power. But the last Labour government should have acted . on it sooner.’ Mr Miliband also spelled out plans to . pay a higher rate of JobSeekers’ Allowance to those who have worked for . at least five years. The full rate of JSA currently kicks in when people . have two years of contributions. ‘People’s faith in the system has been . shaken by a system that appears to give a minority of people something . for nothing and other people nothing for something,’ Mr Miliband said. He confirmed that he would not reverse the Coalition’s cuts to child benefit for high earners. But even that U-turn will not save him . money compared with the Government’s plans. It means simply that he . will not spend even more than the Coalition. Mr Miliband claimed that Labour is . ‘the party of work’ and added: ‘We will tackle the deep, long-term . causes of social security spending and tackle the costs of failure, like . housing benefit.’ He said Labour would also press employers to pay a . ‘living wage’ higher than the minimum wage – a move which some . businesses have claimed will actually cost jobs. The Labour leader repeatedly used the . term ‘social security’ rather than ‘welfare’, apparently because polls . show that voters regard Labour as the ‘welfare party’. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain . Duncan Smith said: ‘They’ve become the welfare party, they’ve voted . against £80billion of our savings in welfare and now we get finally a . vacuous message saying they’re kind of in favour of an overall limit but . they don’t tell us what they would cut. ‘Having got us into this mess, today’s speech told us nothing about how he would get us out.’ Mr Duncan Smith said Labour had been . billing yesterday’s speech as Mr Miliband’s ‘big moment’, and added: ‘If . this is his big moment, God help us when he has a small moment.’ The Labour leader tried yesterday to restore his party’s battered credibility on welfare with a string of policy announcements. Here, our Home Affairs Editor examines if the proposals will actually work, or if they are more empty gestures. CAP THE BENEFIT BILLProposal: Impose a limit on so-called structural benefits, which means those payments such as Housing Benefit which do not fluctuate with the country’s economic fortunes. The cap will last three years to give ministers time to balance the books.Problem: Mr Miliband repeatedly refused to give any details on how the policy would work. A cap would be meaningless if it were deliberately fixed so high that it would never be reached. Labour does not support the Government’s individual benefits cap – which restricts the amount of welfare paid to families to £26,000 a year. The Tories say Mr Miliband has already opposed £83billion of welfare savings proposed by the Coalition. GET EVERYBODY WHO’S FIT INTO WORKProposal: Slash welfare payments by getting the long-term jobless back into the workplace. The State would pay a person’s wages for 25 hours a week, on at least the minimum wage. The business would provide training of at least ten hours a week. Those who refused to take part would lose their benefits.Problem: Will fail if the jobs do not exist. Labour is reliant on  the private sector to create employment opportunities. Yet, at the same time, Mr Miliband is threatening to reinstate the controversial 50p tax rate for high earners – penalising the very wealth creators who will determine the idea’s success. Also, what will he do with the rump of people who simply refuse to work? Neither Labour MPs or the unions would tolerate withdrawing their benefits completely. SLASH TAX CREDIT BILL BY INCREASING WAGESProposal: Expect employers in the private sector to pay a living wage of £7.45 an hour, or £8.55 in London. Mr Miliband claims that, for every pound that employers pay above the minimum wage (currently £6.19), government would save 50p in lower tax credits and benefits. The State would give contracts only to firms which pay the living wage.Problem: It would have a huge cost on businesses struggling their way out of recession and would cut tax income for the Exchequer. In a scathing assessment, Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says: ‘There is not some sort of magic money out there that can allow big companies to pay more without any effect. If that money has to come from somewhere, it may come from their profits, which means less corporation tax. It may come from other people’s pay which means less income tax.’ FIX RENT LEVELS IN PRIVATE SECTORProposal: Give councils the power to force private landlords to reduce the rent they charge to tenants receiving Housing Benefit.Problem: Landlords will resent the State trying to interfere in the free market. They are under no obligation to rent to benefit claimants. Many may decide no longer to bother and rent only to tenants who pay their own bills. TARGET SINGLE MUMS ON BENEFITSProposal: Send single mothers on courses, including CV writing, when their child is aged three or four to prepare them for the workplace.Problem: Mr Miliband is categorical that there would be no requirement to go back to work until the youngest child is five. This is the status quo so the policy will not save any money. Critics say it fails to address the issue of women who have large families who could still be reliant on benefits for a decade or more. Labour will not consider the idea of limiting child benefit to two or three children (though it now supports axing the payments altogether for higher earners).","Ed Miliband will today announce he wants to cap the welfare budget .

Tragedy: Derek Sarkar and his nine-year-old daughter Abbie, whose face has been obscured to protect her identity . A father and his teenage son were killed in a horrifying head-on collision which left his wife and young daughter fighting for their lives. The pensioner driver of the other car was also killed. The accident provoked a huge emergency services response with two air ambulances, three land ambulances and two rapid response paramedic units joining firefighters and police at the remote scene near the village of East Cowick, East Yorkshire. The investigation and clear-up operation took more than seven hours before the road was reopened. Derek Sarkar, 46, and his family, from Sheldon in Birmingham, are believed to have been on an Easter break. Mr Sarkar was driving over a canal bridge on the A614 with his 14-year-old son Ethan in the front passenger seat when their silver Volkswagen Golf collided head-on with a Volvo driven by Sheila Stavert-Lee, 70. A police spokesman said: ‘It appears the Volvo crossed on to the wrong side of the carriageway into the path of the oncoming Golf.’ Mr Sarkar and Ethan were pronounced dead after the crash shortly after 1.30pm on Saturday afternoon. Mr Sarkar’s wife, Karen, 43, and their nine-year-old daughter Abbie were airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary, where they were in a critical condition last night. Mrs Stavert-Lee’s daughter was travelling some distance behind her in another car and came across the scene. Witnesses told how they ran to the scene of the crash and could hear a child screaming. Scroll down for video . Devastation: Front seat passenger Ethan Sarkar was pronounced dead at the scene, Karen Sarkar was airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary where she is in a critical condition . Debbie Hinchliffe, who lives a short distance from the bridge over the Aire and Calder Navigation canal, said she found Mrs Stavert-Lee unconscious in the Volvo, which had smoke pouring from its front. She said: ‘I was standing at my  gate and I heard the crash. I ran to  the scene. ‘The old lady was unconscious and people were screaming in the back of the other car. I couldn’t get anybody out. ‘The car was going to catch fire with the old lady in. ‘So I got in the car with her to turn the ignition off. I released her seatbelt and just stuck with her. I couldn’t do anything else.’ Mrs Hinchliffe said it was clear that both Mr Sarkar and his son were already dead. Within minutes other people arrived at the scene, including emergency services, and they were able to free the occupants from the mangled wreckage. Wreckage: A badly damaged car at the scene of the crash in which three people were killed . Locals complain the stretch of road is a death trap and the scene of regular accidents . Mrs Hinchliffe said she took the . pensioner’s shocked daughter to her house. Police arrived a short time . later to tell her that her mother had died. Mrs Hinchliffe claimed the stretch of road, which has a 40mph limit, was an accident blackspot. ‘There’s . accidents every other week,’ she added. ‘We want speed cameras. You . take your life in your hands every time you pull out. ‘How many accidents and deaths is it going to take before they  do something? ‘We have to live with this on a daily basis. It’s horrendous.’ Hugh Dales, a 55-year-old construction worker, said: ‘There are two or three serious accidents here each year. ‘They came out and did tests  and decided the speed limit  was correct. ‘My wife was told that as there had not been any fatalities there was nothing they could do. Both drivers and a 14-year-old passengers were killed when these two cars collided in Goole, Yorkshire, yesterday . ‘It’s shocking that they have had to wait for somebody to die.’ Last night a neighbour of the Sarkars said: ‘They were an absolutely lovely family, just lovely. ‘We all used to pop in and out of each other’s houses all the time, to chat and do things for each other. ‘Derek used to tease me about anything he could and the kids were really nice kids.’ n A father died yesterday while trying to rescue his son after a giant wave swept him out to sea.

Travel firms have been charging two parents and two youngsters more than they would four adults booking exactly the same package. The levy applied to popular Thomas Cook and Thomson hotels and apartments in Spain, Greece and Turkey. Both firms admitted the pricing discrepancy existed. Penalty . Effectively an under-occupancy charge, the policy is similar to the supplements single travellers fall foul of. The Daily Mail obtained quotes for a family with two children aged six and ten for a week’s holiday on August 3 and compared them with the same stay for four adults. Thomas Cook’s website charged £2,060 for the family at apartments in Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands – £244 more than for a group of four adults. At a hotel on neighbouring Gran Canaria, the price was £1,932 – a premium of £196 over the adult group. Thomson quoted £2,025 for the family to stay at apartments on Menorca – £173 more than the same trip for four adults. A stay at a holiday village in Bodrum, Turkey, cost £1,611 – a £135 premium. Thomas Cook¿s website charged £2,060 for a family which was £244 more than for a group of four adults . A spokesman for the consumer group Which? condemned the policy, saying: ‘It’s completely unfair that holidays should cost more for parents because of under-occupancy charges for children.’ Even though travel companies generally charge for each child – in terms of flights and accommodation – they are often not treated as adults in terms of occupancy targets. As a result, computer systems can trigger a supplement. Hotels use the policy to make up for lower restaurant and bar sales from children. Thomas Cook suggested parents may find it cheaper to describe their youngsters as adults when booking. Thomson apologised for what it claims was a mistake rather than a deliberate policy. ‘We are aware of an issue with the pricing of a very small number of our villa and apartment holidays,’ a spokesman said. Thomson apologised for what it claimed was a mistake rather than deliberate policy . ‘On occasion, a villa or apartment will be more expensive if booked including adults and children compared to a purely adult booking.

The forgotten logbook of a former Royal Navy diver has revealed fascinating details about a unique World War One submarine that sank over 80 years ago as the result of a simple failure to secure the door. The faded diary of Plymouth-born Albert ‘Bob’ Smale who, as a 23-year-old recently-qualified Navy Diver participated in a year-long salvage operation to raise the world’s very first underwater aircraft carrier, HMS M2, has been found by his family. Lee Smale, 62, of Plymouth, Devon, the youngest son of four children born to Bob and Gladys Smale remembers his father’s logbook from childhood. The forgotten logbook of a former Royal Navy diver Bob Smale by his son Lee (pictured) has revealed a fascinating insight into attempts to raise a unique World War One submarine that sank over 80 years ago . The fading diary was rediscovered by the family of Plymouth-born Naval diver who participated in a year-long salvage operation to raise the world's very first underwater aircraft carrier, HMS M2 . It reveals that the World War One submarine that sank over eighty years ago as the result of a simple failure to secure the door . All of the vessel's 60-strong crew lost their lives in the tragedy - believed to be a direct consequence of a failure to secure the submarine's hangar doors before diving . 'The logbook had always been in the family but it we’d never really given it much thought,' he said. 'He died in 1968 but it was only when we began sorting through my mother’s things when she moved into sheltered accommodation that it resurfaced. 'But looking through all his belongings and coming across the logbook again the family recognised its significance.' The M2 was one of four ‘M’ class submarines put into service during WW1 and following the cessation of hostilities was modified to carry a small two-seater Parnell Peto biplane. Intended for aerial reconnaissance . during advance scouting missions, the aircraft had hinged wings to allow . it to fit within a specially designed watertight hangar. Launched by hydraulic ‘catapult’ the Peto, on its return was recovered via a deck-mounted crane.

All of the vessel’s 60-strong crew lost their lives in the tragedy - believed to be a direct consequence of a failure to secure the submarine’s hangar doors before diving. Lying upright on the seabed at a depth in excess of 30 metres, the Royal Navy salvage team, hindered by the strong tidal currents that swirled around the M2, worked around the clock for 11 months to seal the hull prior to filling the vessel with air to refloat the stricken submarine. But as the salvage attempt reached its final stage, and only six metres from the surface, a heavy gale resulted in the operation being aborted and the M2 dropped back down to the seabed. The neat handwritten pages of the logbook initially record Mr. Smale’s diver training, but further examination revealed a passage dedicated to the M2 salvage work carried out by himself and his colleagues. Under a heading entitled 'M2 Salvage” Mr. Smale describes the 'method of sealing hatches with cement.' 'Hatch is closed down and then a layer of small bags filled with cement is placed on top, and then a few buckets of loose cement is put on to fill in the spaces between bags.' The logbook also contains a detailed hand-drawn illustration of the submarine showing its position, features and amendments prior to the failed lifting operation. The . difficulties of working at such a depth, contending with strong tides, . poor visibility and bad weather while dressed in the heavy brass helmets . of the era are also conveyed in detail in a collection of newspaper . cuttings pasted among the book’s pages.

Going on to achieve the rank of Petty . Officer, Bob Smale was a contemporary and close friend of Lionel . ‘Buster’ Crabb, the Royal Navy frogman who disappeared in mysterious . circumstances at the height of the Cold War. Lieutenant Commander Crabb, came to prominence for his pioneering work in underwater bomb disposal during WW2 and while he had all but retired by 1955 just a year later he was recruited by M16 to investigate an advanced propulsion system used by the Soviet cruiser Ordzhonikidze during the vessel’s visit to the United Kingdom. On the evening of April 19, 1956 Crabb descended into the murky waters of Portsmouth Harbour on what was to be his final mission and was never seen again. Several months later the headless and handless corpse of a diver was discovered floating in a nearby harbour, but this was not the end of Commander Crabb’s story. At the inquest into Crabb’s disappearance, the coroner’s report suggested that the body was in all probability that of the missing 47 year-old OBE and George Medal holder - despite to the lack of firm evidence which could have been provided by fingerprints or dental records. Unsurprisingly various theories abounded . as to Crabb’s fate: he was killed by a Soviet sniper; eliminated by M15 . or even defected to the USSR to head their military diving team.

Two bottles of French champagne confiscated by the Nazis during World War Two and then 'liberated' by a British RAF member are to go under the hammer. The bottles - a Chateau de Mareuilsay Montebello 1937 and a Monopole Red Top, by Heidsieck, from an unknown date - are both unopened and in good condition. They were discovered by an RAF serviceman who was serving in France following D-Day in 1944, and who left them to his daughter. She then sold them to the unnamed vendor 10 years ago. The two bottles of champagne were confiscated by the Nazis during the Second World War. Both are unopened and in good condition . The bottles have been stamped with identical red labels in German and French which read 'Wehrmachts - Marketenderware Verkauf in Freien Handel verboten' - Sales in the Free Market are Prohibited - and 'Reserve a la Wehrmacht, Achat et Revente interdits' - Reserved for German Army Not for Resale or Purchase. Around 80 per cent of French champagne was seized by the occupying Germans following the invasion of 1940. Auctioner Charles Hanson said while Adolf Hitler was teetotal, chief of the Luftwaffe Hermann Goering filled vast cellars with stolen bottles of champagne following the invasion of France. He said: 'Following the German conquest of France, the Nazi high command consumed vast amounts of champagne to flaunt their victory. 'They even set up a permanent office at Reims to control the production of fizz, ensuring themselves a constant supply. 'It is remarkable that these two bottles of bubbly still exist, considering the unquenchable thirst the Nazi forces seemed to have for fine French Champagne.

Speaking out: Anna Soubry said midwives should return to routinely weighing pregnant women to help fight the obesity epidemic . Midwives should return to routinely weighing pregnant women to help fight the obesity epidemic, a health minister has said. Anna Soubry said it was ‘absolutely bonkers’ that the NHS had stopped the practice. The mother-of-two said women need not feel such weigh-ins were intrusive – and said that she was happy to be weighed when she was pregnant because it helped her ‘keep an eye on things’. Midwives could then use the information to give women advice on eating more healthily and taking more exercise. The Health Service is having to deal with more and more overweight women having children – putting them at increased risk of pregnancy complications. There is also a concern fat mothers can pass their obesity on to their children. A third of children are now overweight or obese. Yet despite the risks of harm to mother and baby, the NHS stopped routinely weighing pregnant women around the turn of the millennium for fear of stigmatising the obese. Miss Soubry, the public health minister, revealed she was looking at the issue of weighing mothers-to-be during a debate on childhood obesity in Westminster Hall. She also said she wanted updated advice for new mothers to ensure they are better at feeding their babies rather than putting them at unnecessary risk of obesity. Obesity puts mothers at risk of high blood pressure and gestational diabetes, which can make pregnancies more dangerous. There is a higher risk of early induction and Caesarean sections, and a greater threat of pre-eclampsia, which can lead to life-threatening seizures. Maternal obesity also makes babies more likely to be obese in later life, and it can lead to a range of birth defects such as spina bifida. Way forward: It is claimed that midwives could use the information from weighing women to give them advice on eating more healthily and taking more exercise. This picture is posed by a model . The minister’s call was welcomed by Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum. He said: ‘Weighing stopped around the beginning of the last Labour administration when it was considered the practice was unduly concerning women about their size. ‘Measuring them frequently was considered to be non-PC, but what they did was throw the baby out with the bathwater. It has fuelled the consequences of obesity, with effects for mothers, babies and huge expense to the NHS.’ The Royal College of Midwives however said there was no reason to weigh all women, and that it was usual practice to weigh those who are clearly obese. Janet Fyle, a midwife adviser to the college, said: ‘We stopped weighing women because it didn’t make much difference in terms of assessing the state of the pregnancy and foetal wellbeing. ‘You can visibly see if a woman is getting obese, and there are protocols in place so that sometimes we may need to weigh them.’ She added that it was more important to help mothers feed their child healthily.","Anna Soubry said NHS should return to weighing pregnant women .

It was the scene of some of D-Day’s fiercest fighting, where almost 700 brave British troops were killed or wounded. Exactly 69 years ago today - June 6 1944 - courageous UK forces went ashore at Sword Beach into a ferocious barrage from German guns. But on the anniversary of the Normandy landings, as thousands congregate on the coast to remember the selfless Allied sacrifice, veterans are furious their role in history is being airbrushed by money-grabbing French tourism chiefs. Exactly 69 years ago today - June 6 1944 - courageous UK forces went ashore at Sword Beach into a ferocious barrage from German guns . A new promotional campaign to highlight the ‘secteur mythique’ - or ‘mythical sector’ where the invasion took place - has wiped the legendary landing zone off the map. D-Day was a key turning point in the destruction of the Nazis. But the tourist trail, designed to appeal to visitors from all over the world, covers only four of the five main areas of Allied assault. It stretches from Utah and Omaha in the west, where US troops landed, to Gold and Juno beaches, where British and Canadian servicemen respectively attacked occupied Northern Europe. But under controversial proposals it stops short of Sword, the eastern-most flank of Operation Overlord, the largest seaborne invasion in military history. It also excludes drop zones inland where British paratroopers and glider pilots from Army’s 6th Airborne Division landed to secure fabled Pegasus Bridge, the strategically-vital crossing over the Caen Canal. The successful taking of the bridge played an important role in limiting the effectiveness of a German counter-attack in the days and weeks following the invasion. Six tourist boards along the Normandy coast said they wanted the ‘mythical sector’ to concentrate on the American sectors - featured in the Hollywood blockbuster Saving Private Ryan - which attract 85 per cent of the 4.5 million visitors each year. But veterans and local people have accused officials of being motivated by greed rather than honouring the sacrifices made on Sword Beach. George Batts, 88, the honorary secretary general of the Normandy Veterans’ Association, said: ‘I’m astounded. I can’t see how you can do the story of Normandy without including all the beaches.‘During the ten weeks of the Normandy campaign the British accounted for almost half of those killed. Surely this has to be covered. ‘A couple of my good mates were on Sword Beach and they went through hell. To ignore it is disrespect to those who were killed, injured or fought there.’ Mr Batts, who served in the Royal Engineers on D-Day, said that were he alive today the British commander in chief General Sir Bernard Montgomery ‘would be absolutely livid.’ David Churchcroft, 92, a former British infantryman who landed on nearby Gold Beach, said: ‘Leaving places like Sword and Pegasus out of a D-Day tourist trail is disgraceful – there can be no good reason for it, except to perpetuate the myth that the Americans did all the fighting. A new promotional campaign to highlight the 'secteur mythique' - or 'mythical sector' where the invasion took place - has wiped the legendary landing zone off the map . ‘This kind of nonsense has been going on for too long. The sacrifice our troops made should never be forgotten.’ French historian Marc Laurenceau, who runs the Battle of Normandy website D-Day Overlord, criticised the decision by local tourism officials. He said: ‘What they consider is money. Instead of making an effort on Sword Beach and the Commonwealth drop zones, these tourist offices just care about the most popular areas. ‘What will British and French veterans who landed at La Brèche-d’Hermanville on D-Day think? What will be the thoughts of those who were parachuted northeast of Ranville? ‘What about their fallen comrades, killed to free a piece of land that is not considered “mythical” enough according to these six tourist offices?’ Admiral Christian Brac de la Perriere, head of Normandy Memoire, which organises D-Day commemorations in France, said Sword was a ‘sacred’ sector, and that the initiative was driven by money-spinning tourist concerns. ‘There should be a rethink,’ he said. A protest petition calling for the scrapping of the ‘disrespectful’ project has attracted more than 3,000 signatures. On June 6 some 135,000 Allied soldiers landed on the five beaches. By the end of the ferocious fighting on what was immortalised in film as the Longest Day, around 4,000 Allied troops had been killed – but the invaders had secured a foothold in Nazi Europe. Sword Beach stretches roughly five miles from Ouistreham to Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer. The Allied forces most heavily involved in the assault there were the British 3rd Infantry Division.This was where Brigadier Lord Lovat landed with a brigade of Special Forces soldiers who later linked up with troops holding Pegasus Bridge. Symbolically, the British were accompanied by a small unit of Free French commandoes, led by Gallic war hero Philippe Kieffer. The French lost 177 men on Sword Beach. Léon Gautier, president of the Kieffer Commandos Association, said: ‘Is the sweat, the blood shed by the British and French commandoes of less value?’ The ‘mythical sector’ campaign is designed to promote the area ahead of next year’s 70th anniversary, and is the theme for this month’s D–Day Festival, organised by the tourist boards. Loïc Jamin, mayor of Bayeux, and a tourist chief supporting the six local boards’ decision, said: ‘I don’t understand the controversy. ‘The draft mythical sector and its scope are still under consideration. We have not committed to anything.’","69 years ago today courageous UK forces went ashore at Sword Beach .

Oklahoma City attorney Thomas Steece, who is representing Tygard, wrote in the petition that his client ‘has suffered permanent, progressive and painful injuries’ due to the elevator incident. Tygard ‘has suffered and will suffer physical and emotional pain and suffering ... as a result of the subject negligence,’ he wrote.

Since Tygard filed her lawsuit against the school district last June, it appears to have dramatically changed its stance over the issue, reports Newsok.com. Ambri Tygard was one of three girls who got trapped under an elevator at an Oklahoma school in November 2011 . At the time district Superintendent Karl . Springer admitted that the door to the older, lift-style elevator . should've been locked. ‘It's not their fault,’ he said at the time. Now the school district's attorney, Andy Fugitt, is denying nearly all of the allegations made by the girl's lawyers. 'Plaintiff's own negligence was the sole cause of her injuries,' Fugitt wrote. 'Plaintiff was comparatively negligent, and her comparative negligence is in sufficient percentage to reduce or bar any recovery herein.' Despite the apparent contradiction, Fugitt told Newsok.com on Monday that the district's stance on the incident was unchanged.

'At its core, this is an issue about . defending basic human rights but it's also a long-term threat to the . strength of our military. We have to ask ourselves: if left uncorrected, . what impact will this problem have on recruitment and retention of . qualified men and women? 'I cannot overstate my disgust and . disappointment over continued reports of sexual misconduct in our . military. We’ve been talking about this issue for years and talk is . insufficient.' Military leaders admitted sexual assault in the ranks is 'like a . cancer' that could destroy the force, but . they rejected efforts by Congress to strip commanders of some . authority in dealing with cases. Army General Martin Dempsey, chairman . of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the head of each branch of the . military testified at a packed hearing for what is viewed as . an epidemic of sexual assault in the services. After . recent high-profile cases, including an investigation into an alleged . sexual assault by three Navy Academy football players, lawmakers have . moved on legislation to address the scourge of sexual assault. Michigan senator Carl Levin, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said the problem of sexual assault 'is of such a scope and magnitude that it has become a stain on our military'. In previous years Congress has ensured the investigation and prosecution of sexual assaults, Mr Levin said, but more needs to be done. The committee is considering seven bills to deal with sexual assault. As important as additional protections would be, Mr Levin said, the problem will not be addressed successfully without a cultural change throughout the military. And that starts at the top of the chain of command. Impact: Army General Ray Odierno says sexual assaults are destroying the military . Reforms: Senator Kirsten Gillibrand says commanders should not say if a claim goes to trial . 'The military services are . hierarchical organizations: The tone is set from the top of that chain, . the message comes from the top, and accountability rests at the top,' Mr . Levin, who has not endorsed any of the bills, said. The military leaders offered no disagreement about the impact on the services. 'Sexual . assault and harassment are like a cancer within the force - a cancer . that left untreated will destroy the fabric of our force,' Army General . Ray Odierno said. 'It's imperative that we take a comprehensive approach . to prevent attacks, to protect our people and, where appropriate, to . prosecute wrongdoing and hold people accountable.' While . acknowledging the problem and accepting that legislation is inevitable, . military leaders insisted that commanders keep their authority to . handle sexual assault cases. 'Reducing command responsibility could adversely affect the ability of the commander to enforce professional standards and ultimately, to accomplish the mission,' General Dempsey told the committee. The four-star chiefs told the committee they support Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's April recommendation to change the Uniform Code of Military Justice and mostly curtail commanding officers of the power to throw out a verdict. The change, which is included in several of the Senate proposals, is likely to be adopted by the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday in their version of the annual defense policy bill. But service chiefs expressed concern over making broader changes to the military's legal code that would undercut the ability of commanders to discipline troops. General Odierno, the Army's chief of . staff, said a commander's ability to punish quickly, visibly and at the . unit level is essential to maintaining discipline. Out in force: The heads of the U.S. forces testify about the impact of sexual assaults in the military . 'Maintaining the central role of the commander in our military justice system is absolutely critical,' he said. One of the bills proposed by New York . senator Kirsten Gillibrand, would go the farthest by removing . commanders from the process of deciding whether serious crimes, . including sexual misconduct cases, go to trial. That judgment would rest with trial counsels who have prosecution experience and hold the rank of colonel or above. Her . legislation, which has 18 co-sponsors including four Republicans, would . take away a commander's authority to convene a court-martial. That . responsibility would be given to offices outside the victim's chain of . command. Commanders would . maintain their current authority in the legal process in cases of . espionage, theft, sedition and conduct unbecoming an officer in her . bill. The Air Force's top officer, General Mark Welsh, said airmen should have no doubt about who will hold them accountable. 'Commanders having the authority to hold airmen criminally accountable for misconduct ... is crucial to building combat-ready, disciplined units,' he said. A Pentagon report estimated that as many as 26,000 military members may have been sexually assaulted last year, up from an estimated 19,000 assaults in 2012, based on an anonymous survey of military personnel. While the number of sexual assaults that members of the military reported rose 6 per cent to 3,374 in 2012, thousands of victims were still unwilling to come forward despite programs to help them. Barbara Mikulski, a co-sponsor of the Gillibrand bill and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, called the legislation 'bold' and dismissed concerns that it goes too far in overhauling the military justice system. 'I think 26,000 sexual assaults is going too far,' Ms Mikulski said. 'And now there is even a criminal investigation of the football team at the Naval Academy, where we are training the next best.' The Pentagon said last week that the U.S. Naval Academy is investigating allegations that three football team members sexually assaulted a female midshipman in Annapolis more than a year ago. A lawyer for the woman claimed she was 'ostracized' on campus after reporting it. Full house: The congressional hearing into how to stop the rise in cases of sexual assaults was packed . Other recent cases include a soldier . at the West Point Military Academy in New York being charged with . secretly photographing women in a bathroom and the arrest of an Air . Force officer, who led a Sexual Assault Prevention and Response unit, on . charges of groping a woman. James . Inhofe, the top Republican on the committee, said he was wary of . proposals to restrict the authority of commanders to discipline their . troops. 'Fundamentally we cannot abolish sexual assault by legislation alone as you point out. Eliminating sexual assault requires commanders to drive cultural change and achieve accountability,' he said. The power of a commander under military law to convene courts-martial and uphold or dismiss their verdicts dates back to the Articles of War adopted by the Continental Congress in 1775. Service members were not allowed to appeal a conviction to a higher military court until much later. That access to what Mr Hagel has described as a 'robust system of appeal rights' led to his recommendation to take away a commander's power to grant clemency in court-martial cases. The push by members of Congress to further restrict the authority of commanders stems primarily from a case in which Air Force Lieutenant General James Franklin overturned a guilty verdict against a lieutenant colonel convicted on charges of abusive sexual contact and aggravated sexual assault. In cautioning against making significant changes to military law without careful consideration,General Welsh told the committee that complete reversals of court-martial findings in Air Force sexual assault cases were rare. Lieutenant General Franklin's decision is the only one out of 327 cases over the past five years, he said.","Senator McCain said he could not support women joining the military while sexual assault epidemic spreads .

Blow: George Osborne's austerity policies have again been called into question after public borrowing rose last month . George Osborne is drawing up plans for ‘nuclear’ spending cuts this autumn after ‘terrible’ borrowing figures showed the country has plunged deeper into the red. The Chancellor has resisted calls to draw up a Plan B for the economy, but senior civil servants say the Government is working on ‘Plan C’ to prevent a multi-billion-pound black hole opening in the public finances. Official figures showed the Government borrowed £557million last month as a dramatic slump in tax receipts and a surge in spending on benefits punctured the Chancellor’s economic plans. The grim news sent shockwaves through the City and Westminster, where experts had predicted a surplus of £2.5billion. The national debt soared to £1.03trillion – or more than £41,000 per household – compared to £940billion a year ago and less than £400billion a decade ago. Senior Treasury officials admitted that could mean further spending cuts in November’s autumn statement. Mr Osborne is planning to announce a major housebuilding programme when Parliament returns next month. As well, the Government may reform the Highways Agency so it can borrow money to spend on roads, boosting the economy and reducing congestion. The agency, which runs the network of . motorways and A-roads, could be made a government-owned company or . public trust, allowing it to borrow large amounts without increasing the . public deficit. Earlier this year the Government suggested plans to . privatise roads, creating new tolls roads and ‘Lexus lanes’, where . wealthy motorists can pay to beat jams. Whitehall officials say the Treasury . has told Government departments to prepare a fresh round of savings. One . senior civil servant said: ‘The ideas being kicked around are the kind . of unmentionable economies that would make your eyes water. ‘The Treasury is reaching for the . nuclear bunker plans to deal with a liquidity crisis. There simply isn’t . enough money coming in. ‘You will see the kind of cuts that they have had to push through in Ireland and Greece. Nothing is off the table. ‘This isn’t Plan B. We already have a . Plan B and it isn’t working. That was to get the banks lending and move . on big infrastructure projects. It’s not  happening. Now we’re into Plan . C territory, which means more retrenchment.’ Staying the course: The Treasury said today it must stick to its guns on cuts but critics have called on the Chancellor to adopt a plan B . Senior Treasury officials say the full . picture won’t be clear until October, when the independent Office of . Budget Responsibility delivers a critical ruling that will determine . whether the Treasury has to borrow billions more or take an axe to . public spending. A source close to Mr Osborne said: ‘We won’t know the . full situation until October’, and added: ‘The Treasury always prepares . contingency plans.’ In a fresh blow to Mr Osborne a new . ComRes poll for ITV News at Ten showed confidence in the Chancellor at . an all-time low. Just 16 per cent of voters trust him to see the country . through the current crisis against 62 per cent who do not trust him. Yesterday’s figures also provoked a . renewed bout of sniping from Liberal Democrats, many of whom want to see . the Chancellor change course. Lord Oakeshott, the party’s former . Treasury spokesman in the Lords, called on the Government to stimulate . the  economy with ‘two real big bazookas’ – a housebuilding programme . and measures to get banks lending again. He said: ‘I’m afraid just firing off . scattergun shots at the target won’t work. We are in danger of slipping . down into a sort of vicious cycle, whereby no growth then means the . deficit gets worse, then people talk about cutting again. That really . would be self-harm.’ Yesterday’s figures were particularly . worrying because July is usually a bumper month for the public finances – . there was a surplus of £2.8billion last year, meaning the State repaid . rather than borrowed money. But tax receipts were 0.8 per cent . lower than a year earlier while government spending rose 5.1 per cent. Benefits payments jumped 6.2 per cent. And in another blow to ministers, the . Institute of Directors blasted the ‘ineffective’ government. Economist . Graeme Leach said: ‘Business is battening down the hatches in the . expectation that the recession will continue for the rest of the year. Low confidence leads to delayed decisions, and delayed decisions further . undermine economic confidence – it’s a vicious cycle. ‘If the Coalition wants to break this cycle of low economic confidence, then they need to take some bold steps.’ Labour Treasury spokesman Rachel . Reeves said: ‘This is a damning indictment of a Chancellor who promised . to secure the recovery and get the deficit down. His failed plan has . delivered the exact opposite.’ A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The Government remains committed to the credible plan we have set out to deal with Britain’s debts.'","Official figures show rise in borrowing in July unexpectedly rose sharply .

The father of baby and a toddler, who died after their mother left them in a shower for 10 hours when she passed out, told an inquest that his former partner was simply exhausted and not depressed. Miranda Hebble, who was 22 at the time of the tragedy, left her sons Lochlan and Malachi Stevens in the bathroom at their house in Perth, Australia, for ten hours after she passed out. When she woke up she discovered ten-month-old Malachi floating in the shower on his side with bruises on his cheek while Lochlan, two, was lying on the floor with blood coming from his mouth. Father Christopher Stevens with sons Lochlan (left) and Malachi, said he did not believe his then-partner was depressed, but just exhausted . Miranda Hebble, seen with baby Malachi, suffered from anaemia and would sleep even when her children cried . Ms Hebble had been caring for the boys at home alone while their father, Christopher Stevens, was working on a fly-in fly-out basis, the Australian Associated Press reported. Mr Stevens told the court today that Ms Hebble suffered from anaemia and struggled to adapt her sleeping patterns to those of her sons, NineMSN reported. Instead of napping when the children slept, she would watch television. Despite having a baby monitor she would fall asleep while the children wept or screamed, he told the court. Miranda Hebble left the boys - aged two years and 10 months - in the bathroom and closed the door, before either passing out or falling asleep . Ms Hebble had been caring for the boys at home alone while their father, Christopher Stevens, was working on a fly-in fly-out basis . Mr Stevens said although his former partner was a quiet, antisocial person who would not let problems affect her, and he did not believe she was depressed. 'She likes being alone. She always has,' he said. 'If there's any form of conflict she wouldn't go near it.' Lochlan had smeared faeces from his nappy on floors, walls and the baby's cot, spurring her to put the boys in the shower to clean them up. She left to fetch something, closing the bathroom door behind her, but fell asleep before she could return, the inquest was told. When she returned to the bathroom, some ten hours later, both children were dead. Ms Hebble told an emergency services operator: 'I passed out and the plug in the shower got plugged up ... and the shower filled up ... and they're not breathing. They're dead.' Doctors pronounced both boys dead at 2am the following morning. Post-mortem examinations could not reach a definitive conclusion as to how Ms Hebble's sons died in November 2008. Drowning may have caused Malachi's death while Lochlan may have suffered exhaustion, hunger and possible hypothermia with exposure, said forensic pathologist Dr Jodi White.

Fifty-five per cent said that a good day out at the shops is a bigger thrill than spending time between the sheets, even though 10 per cent of items purchased will never make it out of the wardrobe. A retail-addicted 11 per cent told researchers that shopping is always better than love-making, regardless of the circumstances. Thrill: For more than half of British women, a day shopping is better than a night of passion with their husband . The study of 2000 British women, all of whom were in relationships, also found that the average woman thinks about shopping six times a week compared with four times a week spent indulging in 'sexy' thoughts. Worryingly, the study also found that shopping can be a source of tension for couples, with 37 per cent saying that joint shopping trips are often the cause of a heated row. As a result, the majority of women prefer to shop with friends or alone, with just 16 per cent saying that they wanted to spend more time shopping with their partners. Even children were seen as a better choice of shopping partner - 23 per cent of the mothers polled said their husbands were more trouble than their offspring. Is he the reason?

'We . hope our new series Ultimate Shopper will remind people just how much . fun shopping can be and how incredible British high-street fashion is.' But the survey also found that the British passion for fashion also resulted in a significant amount of wasted cash, with nine per cent admitting that 30 per cent of the things they buy are never used or worn. Wasteful habits were particularly notable among those who splashed the cash on accessories, with over a third of women admitting to owning at least three pairs of shoes that they have never worn while nearly a fifth have at least three unused handbags gathering dust. In total, the average woman has unworn clothing and accessories worth £697.23 piled up in their closets. The stack of unworn and unwanted clothing also has a negative impact on stress levels, with more than a quarter of women polled admitting that they suffer from regular bouts of guilt thanks to the amount of shopping they do.

A set of pictures taken by the ape has sold for £50,000 at auction . Mikki, a performer with the Moscow Circus, was trained to take pictures in the 1990s by Russian conceptual artists Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid. The project called Collaboration with Animals aimed to challenge ideas of artistic value by asking the question of whether only humans were capable of creating true art. It began in 1978 with a series of drawings done by a dog. A series of paintings by an elephant in an Ohio zoo later resulted in the founding of three Art Academies for Elephants in Thailand. One of the ape's better efforts shows a view of St. Basil's Cathedral on Red Square, Moscow . Not quite textbook: One of Mikki's efforts shows part of a building in Red Square . The sale also included some images of Mikki standing by his camera which were taken by the duo. Jo Vickery of Sotheby's contemporary art department said, 'You know when people say with contemporary art, ""I could do that"", this really talks to that.' The buyer, Russian art collector Kira Flanzaich, said the photos were a fine example of conceptual art. 'Sometimes you think that animals can maybe photograph or do other things better than a human being,' she said. ""So we could see it in this particular piece, because Mikki took the photographs that are quite good of Red Square."" The set of pictures went under the hammer at Sotheby's auction house in London and were snapped up by a Russian bidder . Unfortunately Mikki was not around to enjoy the praise. The chimp died in 2007. The Sotheby's sale, Changing Focus: A Collection of Russian & Eastern European Contemporary Photography, is expected to achieve over £313,250. It included over 800 photographs by artists of the former Soviet Union. Ms Vickery added: 'This auction marks a significant step in the market for Russian and Eastern-European contemporary photography. 'It reflects the mounting international appetite for such works, and reveals the radical critical reassessment of the genre which has taken place in recent years.'","Blurry images were taken by Russian circus ape Mikki in the 1990s .

Forecasters predict Andrea to slam the west coast of Florida on Thursday before moving northeast, according to the National Hurricane Center. The tropical storm warning covered Florida's Gulf Coast from the southern tip at Boca Grande to Ochlockonee River in the panhandle.

The tropical storm is likely to bring wet weather to parts of Florida's west coast by the end of the week . The first warning comes just two weeks after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season to be particularly 'active'. 'This year, oceanic and atmospheric conditions in the Atlantic basin are expected to produce more and stronger hurricanes,' said Gerry Bell, the lead seasonal hurricane forecaster with NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. 'These conditions include weaker wind shear, warmer Atlantic waters and conducive winds patterns coming from Africa.' Tropical Storm Andrea developed in the Gulf of Mexico in the last few days, inching toward Florida at 3 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storms slow movement is expected to continue through Wednesday night, with maximum winds of 40 mph. Andrea is supposed to pick up speed on Thursday, continuing its movement through Friday. Heavy rainfall ahead: Tropical Storm Andrea is forecast to make landfall over northwest Florida late Thursday . Andrea's center should reach Florida's 'Big Bend'—the intersection of the peninsula and panhandle—on Thursday afternoon, the center reported. It will then move over southeastern  Georgia and eastern South Carolina on Thursday night and Friday. The Weather Channel reported the 'main concern' from Andrea will be heavy rainfall in Florida, which is expected to continue through Friday, because of a combination of upper atmosphere wind shear and dry air on the storm system’s west side. The effect traps the heaviest winds on the east side of the system. Localized flooding throughout the peninsula could result from Andrea's heavy rain. The Weather Channel also reported isolated tornadoes could develop by Thursday. Andrea may also enhance rainfall along the East Coast.","A tropical storm warning has been issued for most of Florida's Gulf Coast .

He was just 13 and I was 23 so I’d been like a father to him. He was a special boy and was following in my footsteps, gaining my passion for food and developing a love for gathering mushrooms from the fields. He looked up to me and I was his mentor – it was the perfect sibling relationship. The mushroom men: Like Antonio, younger brother Enrico developed a love for gathering mushrooms before he died . My life fell apart when the director . of the Olivetti typewriter company, where I was working, called me to . one side and said, ‘I have to tell you something dreadful.’ My blood froze. Enrico had died swimming in the lake near our home at Borgofranco d’Ivrea where the water is extremely cold. He . was the youngest of seven Carluccio children and I couldn’t envisage . anything happening to him. I simply broke down and had to be taken home. We . were always told never to go in the water in hot weather after eating . as it can cause severe cramps and you can drown. But that’s what Enrico . did – and he went down in five feet of water. My . father was the first on the scene and for two hours tried to give him . the kiss of life. We visited Enrico in the morgue that night, and to see . my little brother lying stiff and contorted on the marble is an image . I’ve never been able to forget. My father was devastated, and my mother never recovered. A year later, I moved to Vienna to follow my girlfriend Gerda. It was a double loss for my parents, who didn’t want me to leave, but I had to escape the grief that had engulfed our family and myself. It was there I learnt to cook. Then I became a wine merchant in Germany and never went home again. Embracing change: Antonio with fellow chef Gennaro Contaldo on Two Greedy Italians . I came to London in 1975, having married and divorced Gerda. Then I met my second wife, Priscilla Conran, sister of Sir Terence and head buyer at The Conran Shop. She encouraged me to enter a cookery competition and, though I came second, my love of mushrooms sparked much media interest and led to Terence offering me the job of manager of Conran’s Neal Street restaurant in 1981, which I bought from him in 1989. This became the platform, in 1991, for Priscilla and me to launch the Carluccio’s brand – an Italian restaurant/deli that now has 72 branches. But I sold my shares five years ago because, to tell the truth, I’m not really a businessman. Priscilla and I separated in 2008 and I began to suffer deep depression. I felt I’d never found proper happiness in life, probably because of Enrico’s death. My depression got worse and I tried to take my life. But I’m glad I failed as I ended up at The Priory, which balanced me by encouraging me to explore my spiritual side.

A New Jersey-based Army major and his wife have been accused of torturing their three foster children, breaking bones, force-feeding them hot sauce, denying them water and using one of their biological kids to guard toilet bowls and sinks to ensure the foster kids couldn't get access to water. Carolyn Jackson, 35, was arrested Tuesday morning at their Mount Holly home, while John Jackson, 37, surrendered to federal agents a short while later. The couple have been charged with 17-counts includes conspiracy to endanger the welfare of a child, assault and more than a dozen counts of endangering the welfare of a child. John and Carolyn Jackson of Mount Holly, New Jersey pictured with their three biological kids and two surviving adopted children . The case is being prosecuted federally because the offenses were allegedly committed at the Picatinny Arsenal Installation in Morris County, the military base where Major Jackson is based. According to the indictment, the Jacksons engaged in a constant course of neglect and cruelty toward the three children they fostered and then adopted from August 2005 through April 2010 while they lived at Picatinny Arsenal, which is about 35 miles west of New York City. One of their adopted children, referred to by the initials ‘J.J. (hash)2,’ died in May 2008; although the Jacksons have not been charged in connection to that child's death. During the five years of abuse, the Jacksons allegedly ordered their three biological children not to report the physical assaults, telling them the punishments were supposed to ‘train’ the adopted children how to behave properly, reports NBC4. Prosecutors say the Jacksons allegedly physically assaulted their children with various objects, giving two of them broken bones.

Major John Jackson, center in uniform, and his wife Carolyn, to his right, are charged with conspiracy to endanger the welfare of a child, assault and more than a dozen counts of endangering the welfare of a child .

The couple allegedly ordered one of their own biological children to guard the sinks and toilet bowls in their home on the military base to prevent the foster children from access to water. The Jacksons are also accused of using food as punishment, allegedly forcing their foster children to eat quantities of red pepper flakes, hot sauce, raw onion and salt.

The Duke of Edinburgh proved he's back on his feet after his recent health scare by looking happy and relaxed as he undertook a solo engagement in East London today. Prince Philip visited the Royal Victoria Dock in Newham to  inaugurate the world's oldest complete steamship, the SS Robin. The ship has been restored with the help of lottery funding and will now have a permanent home in the capital. The cause is close to the Prince's heart as he has been campaigning for decades to save the ship for the nation. Back to his old self: The Duke of Edinburgh smiled and waved as he arrived in East London today and chatted to staff who have worked on the SS Robin . Preserved: The Prince is given a tour of the world's oldest complete steamship that he campaigned to save for the nation . In the Seventies the ship, that was built in Britain 1890, was due to be scraped after working as a trade ship in the Atlantic ocean for the British and then Spanish for nearly a century. It survived the First and Second World Wars not to mention numerous treacherous sea voyages. The ship was bought back from the Spanish by the Maritime Trust in 1974 and then returned to British shores, where campaigners, supported by Prince Philip, made it's preservation possible. The Prince was given a tour of the newly restored ship today, before it will be opened to the public next year, and met staff who had made the £3m restoration possible. All board: The prince had to cancel an engagement earlier this week but was feeling shipshape again today . Inauguration: The SS Robin now has a permanent home in Royal Victoria Dock, East London . David Kampfner, chief executive and co-founder of the SS Robin Trust, said: 'She's a true London icon, symbolising the spirit of engineering, innovation, technology and true grit which made - and continues to make - the East End great. 'In his speech the Duke was saying the vessel was very high tech when it was built. He described it as the 'jet plane of its day'. 'That resonates with him. People think of its history but it was very modern when it was built. He related it to the origin of modern shipping.'

She made her name with We Need To Take About Kevin, a book about a mass-murderer's mother's struggle to accept her son's killings. The novel that was turned down by 30 publishers before Serpent's Tail launched it to cult status was adapted to a hit film starring Tilda Swinton. And now edgy writer Lionel Shriver is back with another shocking book, but this one is a lot closer to home. Lionel Shriver poses after winning the Orange Prize For Fiction for We Need To Talk About Kevin in 2005 . 2011 film We Need to Talk About Kevin by British director Lynne Ramsay starred Scottish actress Tilda Swinton . Big Brother tells the story of Pandora, a middle-aged woman who moves in with her obese older brother, Edison, to help him lose weight on an extreme liquid diet. Her very own older sibling Greg was obese, weighing 24 stone at his heaviest. He suffered from diabetes, was reliant on a portable oxygen tank, and died of cardiac arrest in 2002. Despite the apparent similarities Shriver professes the family in Big Brother bears no resemblance to her own. Unsurprisingly for someone who has experienced such tragedy, Shriver is in unbelievably good shape for her 55 years - the same age her brother was when he died. She admits to embarking on a torturous diet and exercise regime in an interview with Grazia, and reveals some eccentric views on life and health. 'We are meant to be hungry,' she says. 'It's more exciting and enjoyable to be striving for something than to actually get it.' Shriver, pictured with husband Jeff, says we are meant to be hungry. Obesity was an issue in her family . She cycles everywhere and has a meticulous daily exercise regime consisting of 130 press-ups, 200 side crunches, 500 sit-ups and 3,000 star jumps. Even with all this exercise to consider Shriver still doesn't eat anywhere near enough food to actually put weight on, skipping lunch entirely in favour of a bowl of popcorn. Somewhat haunted by obesity, Shriver wards the disease away from herself while indulging in voyeuristic television on the topic. 'Over the years I've watched an appalling number of TV shows like half Ton Man and Embarrassing Bodies - I'm a real sucker for all that.' While she puts pressure on herself to stay slim, she doesn't believe women should be pushed to extremes by the media. 'I would rather see models weigh a little more,' she tells Grazia. I'm especially antagonistic to computer-fiddling. 'So not only do you take women who are improbably thin to begin with but then you start shaving away bits of them until there's not even room for their intestines anymore.'

"At least 28 public executions in Iran in recent months . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 08:25 EST, 22 July 2011 . Lined up standing on buses in front of a baying mob with their necks tied to a bridge, these are the final moments of three men subjected to a public hanging. But rather than originating from decades ago, these pictures were taken last week in Iran, where the death penalty is still publicly used to this day. After the ties are secured, the buses on which the men stand are driven away, leaving the hastily-convicted criminals hanging in front of crowds of onlookers, many of whom are children. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A shocking video has been released by Amnesty International showing a public execution in Iran . Outrage: The video was passed on to human rights campaign group Amnesty International . The footage was released by human rights group Amnesty International, who have denounced the renewed surge in the use of the death penalty across the Islamic republic. The video was shot on July in Azadi Square, in the western city of Kermanshah and features the public execution of three men convicted of rape. During the 26-second clip in which the crimes of the men are announced over a loudspeaker, numerous onlookers are seen photographing or filming the graphic executions. Human rights officials are concerned not only about the executions, but also the legal system preceding them. It is thought the three men seen hanged were tried and convicted of rape within two months, raising questions about the fairness of their trial. Amnesty International say the deaths are among at least 28 executions acknowledged by the authorities. The group's Middle East and North Africa Deputy Director Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui said: 'These latest public executions underline the continuing horror of the death penalty in Iran. Amnesty International have described the videos as 'deeply disturbing' and a 'gross affront to human dignity' Grisly: At the end of the video the buses move away and the prisoners die in front of the crowd . 'Not only those executed, but all those who watch public executions, including, children, are brutalised and degraded by the experience. 'These public displays of killing perpetuate a culture of acceptance of violence and bloodlust, rather than a belief in justice. 'It is deeply disturbing that despite a moratorium on public executions ordered in 2008, the Iranian authorities are once again resorting to this inhuman practice. 'All executions violate the right to life. Those carried out publicly are a gross affront to human dignity which cannot be tolerated. 'Executions after speedy unfair trials are no solution to the extremely serious problem of rape in Iran, which feeds on the acceptance of violence against women at all levels of society. 'The Iranian authorities should be aiming to combat this culture of violence rather than perpetuate it through these public displays of brutality.' The executions follow several widely publicised gang rapes of women this year in Iran. In some cases, officials blamed the victims for failing to adhere to the official code on dress or gender segregation. According to UN human rights experts, executions in public serve no legitimate purpose and only increase the cruel, inhuman and degrading nature of this punishment. The Iranian authorities do not publish official statistics on their use of the death penalty, despite repeated calls for transparency by UN human rights bodies. Note: Some readers may find the footage disturbing.",At least 28 public executions in Iran in recent months .

When Boston bombing victim Erika Brannock left hospital on Monday, she thanked her support team but asked for one final favor: To help find the woman who had saved her life that day. She only remembered the woman as 'Joan from California' but after a plea from CNN to its viewers, the hero has been tracked down, and has been identified as Amanda North from the Bay area. North, who is in her 50s and has two children, can be seen in photographs beside Brannock's injured body on April 15, giving EMTs a belt for tourniquet to stop the blood from her badly mangled leg. Brannock, a pre-school teacher from Maryland, needed her left leg amputated above the knee and also lost part of the bone from her right leg. She was the last victim to leave hospital on Monday. Scroll down for video . Hero: Erika Brannock, left, said she wanted to track down the woman who had saved her life and comforted her after the Boston bombings.

As she left, she told the Boston Globe . that after the bomb blasts, a woman approached her with a belt for a . tourniquet and said: 'I'm Joan from California, and I'm not going to let . you go.' 'She had short . brown hair and a yellow jacket,' Brannock said, adding that she was . desperate to find her. 'I honestly don't believe I'd be here if it . weren't for her.' On Monday night, CNN decided . to help her and posted an image to Facebook of the woman beside . Brannock following the blast. It was shared more than 1,500 by people . from across the country. Then . the woman herself - now identified as Amanda North - emailed the . network with the subject: 'That's me!' She had received text messages . from friends who had seen the segment on AC 360. Search: Anderson Cooper's team asked if anyone knew the woman, believed to be called 'Joan' North's niece, sister-in-law and a friend confirmed her identity in emails to the network. As Brannock suffered a perforated eardrum, she misheard North's name. North, who also suffered hearing loss from the blast, likewise believed that the woman she helped was called 'Irene'. North was later treated at hospital for cuts and lacerations, and also had badly singed hair, which she cut. But CNN reported that she was so busy helping Erika she did not even realize she was hurt. She told CNN she had been at the marathon to support her daughter, a Harvard student, in the race. Reporter Randi Kaye told Anderson Cooper on Tuesday night that the woman was overcome with emotion when they contacted her about Brannock. Injured: Erika lost her left leg above the knee and bone in her right leg and suffered burns and loss of hearing . 'She was so choked up,' Kaye said. 'She said that she's been thinking about Erika since the marathon. She had no idea what happened to her. She didn't even know if she survived. 'She did want us to give a message to Erika: That she never stopped holding her hand.' North added that her life was transformed on the day of the bombings. The network has arranged for the women . to be reunited in Baltimore, where Erika is still receiving treatment, . and will air their meeting on Anderson Cooper 360 on Wednesday evening.

Pull a British-owned suitcase off an airport conveyor belt and chances are you will be able to tell where in the country its owners are from, just by opening it up and taking a peek inside . And you needn't even look too closely at the contents of the bag to make your guess... just at how they have been packed. Whether you're a roller, a wrapper, a shrinker, a flinger or a stacker may provide clues as to where in the UK you reside, according to new research into the holiday packing habits of the population. Are you a flinger, a roller, a wrapper or a stacker? Where in Britain you live might determine it . Holiday-makers from Scotland, the East Midlands and Northern Ireland are most often space-saving 'rollers', turning each item of clothing into a neat little sausage to maximise space and prevent crumpling. The West Midlands, North East and South West is home to the super-neat and ultra-careful 'wrappers', fond of neatly encasing each piece of clothing in tissue paper to minimise ironing later. Architecturally-savvy 'stackers' are most often found in East Anglia and the North West, and they can be spotted building piles of clothes, beginning with the largest pieces and working their way up to the smaller items in an orderly manner. One third of Britons will be stowing away food and beverage . favourites such as teabags, brown sauce, pork pies, digestive biscuits . and marmalade into their suitcase to enjoy while on holiday. 'Shrinker' fashionistas - most frequently found in London and Wales - are the most forward-thinking of the lot, choosing outfits for every day of the holiday, then vacuum-packing each one to utilise on space and aid un-packing later. And then there are the 'flingers', those who don't have the time, energy or inclination to bother with any of the above, and instead just hurl anything they can find into the open suitcase and pray it will close. And these busy souls are living in Yorkshire and the South East. Flingers, those who don't have the time, energy or inclination to bother rolling or stacking, instead just hurl anything they can find into the open suitcase and pray it will close . The research, conducted by Travelodge, also found that 52 per cent of the Britons who will be going on summer holiday this year (75 per cent) will dedicate an enormous seven hours . packing their holiday essentials, which includes shopping for bits and pieces needed for the trip.

(South East, Yorkshire) Despite this, British holidaymakers will collectively splash out . £684 million during their holiday on essential items they have accidentally left at home, an average spend of £26.50. Some 51 per cent of us forget something important at home, and the items most frequently needed to be bought at the airport or holiday destination are men's swimming trunks, followed by jumpers and cardigans, then bikinis, dresses, sunglasses, shorts, underwear, coats and finally shoes. In all, the UK will splash out a staggering £684 . million (an average spend of £26.50) on forgotten items every year.

(21 per cent) of lazy Britons just throw a selection of items into their . suitcase and play pot luck with their belongings on holiday, while 61 per cent pack with military precision and dedicate time to prepare a detailed schedule and essentials check-list . prior to starting the task. Ironically, whilst British . holidaymakers' bulging suitcases may be lacking one holiday essential, more . than two thirds of us (67 per cent) of Britons usually bring back home . up to six unworn complete outfits and three pairs of shoes that were not . suitable for their holiday. How do you pack yours? To help Britons pack better for their . holiday, Travelodge developed a seven step guide to ensure no . essential holiday items are left behind for this year’s summer break. Step One: Think . What & Where . Consider everything you might be doing during your . holiday (Posh dinners, sporting activities, sight seeing) then put your . favourite items for these scenarios on your bed in piles of tops, . bottoms, dresses, shoes, jackets/cover-ups, swimwear. Anything that . doesn't have a specific use doesn't need to come with you. Step Two: Colour Code Clothes: . Look at everything and choose items based on the fact they will work . with lots of other items. Thinking of a colour palette makes this even . simpler. What you are doing here is ensuring everything works really . hard and you don’t end up lugging loads of things that just don’t go . with anything else and you will end up never wearing. Step Three: Divide . & Rule . Once you have decided on your clotting, lay it out on the . bed before you place them in the suitcase and cut in half. It may sound . drastic but it forces you to focus and just remember all the items you . have taken on holiday before and never worn. Step Four: Rollin’, . Rollin’, Rollin’ Roll every item that can be rolled, as this will . negate creasing. If you take anything remotely tailored, turn it inside . out and tuck in the sleeves and it will arrive in the best shape . possible. Sitting on your suitcase to cram everything in is a common last resort . Step Five: Bury . the shoes . Pack shoes at the bottom of your suitcase and surround . them with your underwear. Remember to pack into the corners of your bag - . lots of space can be wasted by not filling a bag correctly. Step Six: Go . See Through . See through wash bags with compartments are brilliant . for organising your toiletries. They tend to be lightweight and you can . check quickly to see if you've forgotten anything . Step Seven: Weather . planning . Look at an updated weather forecast just before packing to . ensure you are taking the right clothes for the weather conditions at . your destination.","Britons will spend an average of £26.50 buying items we forgot to pack .
Despite this, two-thirds of us always overpack .
67% of us bring home six unworn outfits and three unworn pairs of shoes ."

David Cameron has developed a ‘special relationship’ with Tony Blair, holding at least eight conversations with him on how to run the country. Mr Blair visited Mr Cameron’s official country residence of Chequers last July – a meeting that has previously never been disclosed by Downing Street. The pair have also had at least seven phone conversations since Mr Cameron took the keys to No10, a rate of around once every three months. Advice: David Cameron (left) has held at least eight conversations with Tony Blair on how to run the country . Mr Cameron and Mr Blair had a phone chat as recently as February this year. They also spoke in January and have another call scheduled for September according to Downing Street sources. Officials have previously admitted Mr . Blair has briefed Mr Cameron in his capacity as a Middle East envoy. But the full extent of their conversations has never before been . revealed. Meetings: Labour peer Lord Adonis, left, met Mr Cameron on Monday in talks previously kept quiet by No10. Mr Blair is understood to have held talks with Mr Cameron's recently departed policy guru Steve Hilton, right . Is David Cameron wise to seek Tony Blair's advice? Well-placed sources admit their discussions stray far beyond foreign affairs and into how the Government should reform public services and the civil service. They have also discussed the euro crisis and the economy. Mr Blair has also been advising Mr Cameron on how to cope with the rigours of the job as he undergoes the most testing time of his premiership. ‘They have a lot to talk about,’ said a senior source. ‘It is quite a special relationship between one Prime Minister and another. Who else knows what you’re going through? ‘They ostensibly talk about the Middle East but when you’ve got him on the phone it is natural to talk politics.’ Mr Blair has also had discussions on public service reform with senior ministers and it is understood he has held talks with Mr Cameron’s recently departed policy guru Steve Hilton. A spokesman for Mr Blair said: 'Of course, from time to time he speaks to the PM, particularly in his role as Quartet Representative, as he does with many world leaders. 'But he does not routinely advise the PM on domestic or other policy.' Labour peer Lord Adonis, who helped pioneer Mr Blair’s academy schools programme, which Education Secretary Michael Gove has dramatically expanded, was in No10 for talks with Mr Cameron on Monday. That meeting was also previously kept quiet by No10. Discussions: Tony Blair has been advising Mr Cameron on coping with the rigours of the job at Number 10 . Senior Tory sources say the Prime . Minister has not ruled out offering a job to Lord Adonis, who is . supposed to be running Labour’s own industrial policy review. Mr Cameron’s policy unit has also . been consulting Matthew Taylor and Geoff Mulgan, two former heads of Mr . Blair’s Downing Street policy unit. Details of the extensive web of contacts are likely to enrage partisans on both Tory and Labour benches. Tory . backbenchers are already concerned Mr Cameron spends as much time . listening to the Liberal Democrats as he does Conservative backbenchers. Mr Cameron gained notoriety with his own party by dubbing himself the . ‘heir to Blair’ during the 2005 leadership contest. The disclosure he is . advising Mr Cameron will send many into orbit. Mr . Blair has let it be known he wants to play a larger role in domestic . politics. But it will surprise Labour loyalists he is lending his wisdom . to Mr Cameron as well as Labour leader Ed Miliband. Mr . Blair is privately said to admire Mr Cameron who has sought to drag his . party to the political centre ground. The former Prime Minister has also advised him how to get . around obstructionists in the civil service who slow the pace of reform. To . the fury of their party grassroots, many Cameroons regard Mr Blair as a . folk hero whose attempts to reform the public services they must build . on. A senior Tory said: . ‘His influence is very firmly felt. 'He’s like the footballer Cristiano . Ronaldo – gone but still greatly admired.’ Tory backbencher Stewart Jackson pointedly observed that Mr Blair, unlike Mr Cameron, has won a general election. He . said: ‘Mr Cameron is facing mid-term difficulties with the euro crisis, . a lack of growth in the economy and having to put up with the Liberal . Democrats. ‘I . don’t blame him for seeking advice from a variety of sources including . Tony Blair, who after all has actually won an election. ‘But he needs to remember he is actually in a coalition not just with the Lib Dems but also with the rest of his party.’","Blair visited Cameron at Chequers last July, Downing Street reveals .

So the Lammars decided to do what was for the greater good - they turned him over to police. Last year, Tricia Lammers found a receipt for an $865 shotgun in her mentally-ill son's pocket. Blaec Lammars was able to buy the shotgun from the same Missouri Walmart where he was picked up by police a year earlier holding a butcher knife and a Halloween mask. He later told his parents he had picked out an employee who he was going to follow into the back of the store and kill after watching Halloween, because the character Michael Myers 'got him to thinking'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Arrested: Blaec Lammers, 20, is accused of planning to launch shooting sprees in Bolivar, Missouri . Parents: Whatever the outcome was going to be, the Lammars were sure to lose their son, so they decided to do what was for the greater good - they turned him over to police . His father Bill said: 'What he told us was he had picked out someone. He was going to watch them go into the back room, follow them back there, and hopefully the police would get him and shoot him first before he did anything.' Yet Blaec was able to buy the assault rifle despite being in and out of mental hospitals throughout his life - one time for threatening to put a pipe bomb under his teacher's car. On turning her own son in to the . police, Tricia said: 'My first thought was, ""What have I done? I just . destroyed my son's life."" And people would come up to me and say, ""No, . you saved our lives"". 'This is my hell. This is my hell. If I make it through this, I go to heaven.' When his parents checked him into mental institutions, he could only stay for four days at a time, which is the legal limit without a court order. The Lammars told CBS they didn't realize how serious his condition was despite spending $50,000 on medical bills. Troubled: Throughout his life Blaec Lammars was in and out of mental hospitals and was diagnosed with various different conditions including Asperger's and bipolar . Scared: Blaec's violent outbursts and manic behavior, forced the family to lock up their belongings. One time, he came up behind his sister, center, holding a knife . 'Mentally ill': The 20-year-old is said to have suffered from depression and been off his medication . His doctors would give him new meds and a new diagnosis each time - everything from Asperger's to bipolar to schizophrenia. Bill said: 'Maybe it's just teenage hormones. You try and figure out anything but a mental condition.' By the time he bought the shotgun, he had been committed seven times, but this did not show up in his background check because he had never been committed involuntarily by the courts. A day after discovering the receipt, Tricia contacted police, who arrested Blaec. Investigators later determined he had recently purchased two assault rifles and 400 rounds of ammunition. He allegedly admitted that he was planning to launch a murderous shooting spree in a movie theater during the opening weekend of the new Twilight film and had already bought a ticket to a screening of Breaking Dawn Part 2. He admitted to police that he was inspired by a number of well-publicized mass shootings, such as James Holmes' attack on a theater showing The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado, last year. On turning her own son in to the police, Tricia said: 'My first thought was, ""What have I done? I just destroyed my son's life."" And people would come up to me and say, ""No, you saved our lives"" They spent $50,000 on medical bills to figure out what was wrong with him. Father Bill said: 'Maybe it's just teenage hormones. You try and figure out anything but a mental condition' Locked up: Lammars, now 21, is currently languishing in Polk County jail charged with making a terrorist threat, first-degree assault and armed criminal action. He faces life in prison . Lammers also said he planned to ‘just . start shooting people at random’ at the Walmart store less than a mile . away, so if he ran out of bullets, he could ‘just break the glass where . the ammunition is being stored and get some more and keep shooting until . police arrived,’ investigators wrote. Her son, now 21, is currently languishing in Polk County jail charged with making a terrorist threat,  first-degree assault and . armed criminal action. He faces life in prison. After he was arrested he spoke to authorities about the day he planned to murder a Walmart employee. He said he watched the clerk for more than two hours and was planning to follow him into a storage room and kill him when he heard his name over the public address system and his father calling his name. No charges were filed in that case. Instead, Lammers, who was 17 at the time, was committed for 96 hours for . a mental health examination. 'Quiet': The suspect described himself as a 'loner' and admitted he had had 'homicidal thoughts' Death: Lammers had bought a ticket to the new Twilight film where he planned to launch his massacre . Inspiration: Lammers planned to imitate James Holmes, who killed 12 movie-goers in Aurora, Colorado . 'Thankfully we had a responsible family member or we might have had a different outcome,' Bolivar police chief Steve Hamilton said. He said Lammers is under a doctor's care for mental illness, and court documents said he was 'off of his medication'. Mr Hamilton said it appeared that Lammers obtained the firearms legally but that police were continuing to investigate 'to determine how in fact he was able to obtain a permit'.","Blaec Lammers followed a male clerk for more than two hours with a knife in his hand when he was 18 .

A woman whose ex-boyfriend forced her to watch as he stabbed her sister and best friend to death says she will never forgive herself for bringing him into their lives. Kim Frank, 17, and Samantha Sykes, 18, were murdered by 21-year-old Ahmad Otak at Kim's flat in Wakefield in March last year. He plunged his knife into Kim as he pretended to be leaving the flat she shared with her older sister, his former girlfriend Elisa Frank. Otak stood over Kim's body laughing, then licked blood from the knife and spat on her. Scroll down for video . Kim Frank, left, was murdered in front of her sister Elisa, right, by Ahmad Otak last March . He then tied Elisa up, held her at . knifepoint, and forced her to summon Miss Sykes to the flat, where he . stabbed and slashed her 34 times. Now Miss Frank, 20, has spoken about the double killing for the first time, and says she wishes Otak had killed her instead. ‘Every day I wish he had taken my . life instead of theirs and I’ll never forgive myself for bringing him . into their lives,' she told the Sunday Mirror. 'The only thing that stops me from killing myself now is that I can’t allow him to get three out of three.’ Miss Frank said she will never forget . the bloody scene of the deaths. She is haunted by flashbacks and . nightmares and last year was sectioned under the mental health act after . a drug overdose. The asylum seeker from Afghanistan . was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to the murders. He . must serve at least 34 years before he can be considered for release. Otak abducted Miss Frank after the killings, using Miss Sykes' car to drive to Dover in a failed bid to flee to France. His plan was foiled when an Iranian refugee who was trying to leave Britain managed to grab his knife, told Miss Frank to run, and helped her to raise the alarm. Sadistic Otak then claimed his ex had . helped him kill the two women and she was arrested. It took three days . for her to be released. Their relationship began when Miss Frank met Otak in a children's . home in Wakefield. He had arrived in Britain in 2007 and claimed he was younger . than he was. He told Miss Frank that his parents were dead and spoke . about the murders he had seen back home. Elisa and Kim had been taken into care when they were 14 and 13 respectively because their mother couldn't cope. Their father walked out on the family when she was a baby, but has been reunited with his daughter since her horrific ordeal. Elisa's best friend Samantha Sykes, left, was stabbed 32 times while her sister Kim, right, had 15 wounds . Kim was sent to live with a foster family in Wales, and Miss Frank turned to Otak to help her cope with depression following the separation. Once she left the care system, the couple moved in together. They planned to marry in 2011, but Miss Frank called off the wedding once Otak's violent and controlling nature showed itself. He controlled what she wore and made her walk behind him at all times. 'He started making up weird rules,' she told the paper. 'One day he told me I wasn’t allowed to talk to men any more. I wasn’t allowed to drink either because it wasn’t allowed in his culture. Then he stopped me from seeing certain girls he said were a bad influence.' These 'bad influences' included her younger sister and Miss Sykes. When Miss Frank protested against Otak's attitude towards the women, he hit her. He thought the girls were 'dirty', despising Miss Sykes for 'flaunting' her body in her fledging modelling career and decrying Kim because she had had more than one boyfriend. In September 2011 Miss Frank decided their relationship was over but relented when he threatened to throw acid in her face and petrol bomb her mother's house. By February last year, Miss Frank had fled to Kim's flat after her sister's return to Wakefield. Otak . had held a kitchen knife to her throat while forcing her to have sex . with him. He then told her he would sew her mouth up if she screamed. He bombarded his ex with calls and text messages, pleading for the couple to reunite. Miss . Sykes reported Otak to the UK Border Agency and contacted police, but . no action was taken because Miss Frank did not want to make a statement . against him. Ahmad Otak must serve 34 years in prison for the double murders before he can be considered for parole . A month after their split, Otak agreed to return the belongings Miss Frank had left behind when she fled their shared home for the safety of her sister's flat. Once he had slaughtered Kim, he made Miss Frank speak to her best friend Miss Sykes on the phone. 'I was shaking with fear and praying she’d tell from my voice that something was wrong and raise the alarm, but 10 minutes later there was a knock at the door,' she told the paper. 'Ahmad went to meet her. I’ll never forget the sound of her screams as he plunged the knife into her. She called my name but I couldn’t get to her. Then he dragged her bleeding body into the living room and dumped her at my feet next to Kim.' Miss Frank, who recently spent two months receiving psychiatric care in hospital, recalled the gurgling noises her sister and best friend made as they strugged for their last breaths. But she has vowed to keep going for Kim and Miss Sykes.","Elisa Frank, 20,was forced to watch as Ahmad Otak stabbed the women .

If the lady in your life is closing in on the age of 31, you may not want to make too much of a fuss of the following. According to a survey, it seems that women start adopting the same attitudes and tastes as their mothers when they are 31 – the same age as the Duchess of Cambridge. The key turning point which sees daughters become more like their mothers is the birth of their first child. Will the Duchess of Cambridge, pictured left yesterday at the Coronation celebration, begin morphing into Carold Middleton, right, now that she is 31 years old and expecting her first child? Beyonce, right and her Tina Knowles, left, have always had a close relationship, and the singer's fashion designer mother came to prominence as the costume designer for her daughter's first pop group, Destiny's Child . The early 30s are also typically the . time at which a woman gets married and starts to adjust to family life . and the need to pay a mortgage. More than half of the 1,000 women . surveyed by online gambling firm Dotty Bingo said they stopped rebelling . against their mothers in their early 30s and started mimicking them . instead. Only 5 per cent of women said they turned into their mothers in their 20s. By far the most popular age for the change was 31. The Duchess celebrated her 31st birthday in January and her first baby is due in July. She plans to live with her 58-year-old mother Carole Middleton at the family home in Berkshire following the birth. The poll’s conclusions chimed with . official statistics. Figures assembled by the Office for National . Statistics show the average age at which a woman has a baby has now . climbed to 29.7, and the typical age at which a woman marries is 30. Some 51 per cent of those in the study . named their mother as the most inspirational woman in their lives. Sisters came second with 18 per cent, grandmothers gained 10 per cent . and best friends were fourth with 8 per cent. More than a third of those polled said giving birth was the most obvious trigger for women turning into their mothers. 30-35 - 52% . 35-40 - 26% . 40-50 - 10% . Over 50 - 7% . 20-30 - 5% . Around a quarter said enjoying the same TV shows or soaps was a telltale sign. Other popular indicators included . taking up the same hobbies, using the same sayings and even being . attracted to the same type of men. Dotty Bingo's Craig Perrott said: 'Virtually all women turn into their mothers at some point in their lives and that is something to be celebrated. 'Our mums are the most wonderful people in our lives. It is interesting that the Duchess Cambridge has reached 31 - the age when most people think women turn into their mothers. 'Kate has just about the most glamorous mum in the world in Carole Middleton - and Carole will soon be the most glamorous granny.'","Duchess of Cambridge and Beyonce are both 31 years old .

Actor and comedian Jay Mohr incited a Twitter-storm of backlash Monday, tweeting in reaction to a massacre at the Boston Marathon that the '2nd Amendment must go. Violence has 2 stop.' The Boston terror attacks were carried out with pressure cooker-encased explosive devices, not with firearms. 'The 2nd Amendment lends itself to the . CULTURE of violence we are living in,' he clarified later, as The Daily Caller reported, after a fan responded that his argument was 'silly. How can you connect the 2nd amendment [sic] to a terrorist act?' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Jay Mohr, who has defended violent movies in the guise of at least one on-screen character, tweeted an anti-gun rant on Monday, later saying he didn't mean to connect with Monday's Boston bombings with a call to abolish the Second Amendment . Mohr seemed to confuse the Boston Marathon bombings with a an episode of gun violence, but later clarified that he was talking in generalities . Mohr played a movie producer in the TV series Action. The character defended violence in films, saying that Hollywood gives Americans what they want . In a short-lived Fox television series called Action . that aired in 1999 and 2000, Mohr played a movie producer whose violent . and bloody productions offended members of Congress. In one scene captured on YouTube, he . lectures a U.S. senator, saying American audiences 'want the good guy to . win. They want the bad guy to die, hopefully in the biggest explosion the budget will allow.' 'If I'm a malignancy and my movies are cancer,' Mohr's character Peter Dragon shouts during a fictional congressional hearing, 'I hope the whole country gets cancer.' Mohr also played a police sergeant in the 2008 Keanu Reeves action flick Street Kings, about an officer whose wife is violently gunned down and finds himself accused of viciously slaying a fellow policeman. But responding to Twitter users who defended American gun rights, Mohr insisted that he was '[j]ust sick of watching bloodshed on TV. It's become reality tv and we're becoming numb.' The 'Newtown tragedy was gun violence,' he said in another tweet. 'Where . are u maniacs coming from. I'm just stating that its so sad we're . getting used to watching it on tv.' One Twitter reply captured the irony, advising him that 'if u want the culture of violence to stop, look in your acting mirror. Hypocrite.' Fellow actor Adam Baldwin got in on the act, tweeting a one word assessment of Mohr's political position: 'Stupid!' Adam Baldwin responded quickly to Mohr's tweet that the '2nd Amendment must go' Adam Baldwin (L) pictured as Jayne Cobb in the TV program Firefly, jumped all over Jay Mohr for saying Americans should ditch their constitutional guarantee of 'the right to bear arms' Mohr lost his temper after fans slammed him for confusing bombs with guns . Mohr later lost his temper while tweeting that he was talking generically about violence, and not about the Monday bombings in Boston. 'LISTEN! The 2nd amendment has nothing 2 do w 2day in Boston. I didn't say it did,' he wrote. The '[l]ast few times in front of tv like this was guns. F--koff.'

Tax havens which allow the mega-rich to hide their wealth from the UK taxman have been summoned to London to explain themselves. David Cameron has warned Britain's overseas territories and crown dependencies that he is determined to tackle the ‘scourge of tax evasion’ which costs Britain billions. Senior ministers from 10 territories including Jersey, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands have been invited to a meeting this month where they will be urged to sign up to greater tax transparency. Scourge: David Cameron, pictured walking to Parliament today, has summoned ministers from British territories to a tax summit this month . Mr Cameron has made the tax avoidance and evasion a priority of the G8 summit which he is hosting in Northern Ireland on June 17 and 18. He has warned overseas territories of the need to ‘get our own houses in order’ and will attend the Open for Growth conference on the weekend before the G8 summit opens. Senior ministers from Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Anguilla, Montserrat, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man are expected to attend. Some of the islands and outposts are widely regarded as offshore tax havens, though they dispute this description and regard their low-tax regimes as vital to their economies. There is said to be disagreement in Whitehall about how much pressure to put on the islands, fearing excessive demands from London could lead to them refusing to co-operate. Mr Cameron is examining the idea of getting the tax havens to sign up to an OECD convention on the sharing of information on tax between countries, which is seen as a key to tackling evasion. Last month he wrote to the British overseas territories warning them that he had made ‘fighting the scourge of tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance’ a priority for the G8 summit. Haven: A total of 10 overseas territories and crown dependencies, including Gibraltar, have been told to 'get their own houses in order' Summit: Ministers from the Cayman Islands (left) and Bermuda have been urged by Mr Cameron to ensure tax transparency ahead of the talks in London this month . He added: ‘I am looking to all the overseas territories and crown dependencies to continue to work in partnership with the UK in taking the lead on two critical issues: tax information exchange and beneficial ownership. ‘I respect your right to be lower tax jurisdictions. I believe passionately in lower taxes as a vital driver of growth and prosperity for all. ‘But lower taxes are only sustainable if what is owed is actually paid - and if the rules to achieve this are set and enforced fairly to create a level playing field right across the world. ‘There is no point in dealing with tax evasion in one country if the problem is simply displaced to another.'' A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘We strongly welcome the overseas territories' positive engagement with our G8 presidency agenda on tax transparency and the significant progress they have made in this area. ‘We look forward to welcoming them to our G8 Open for Growth event in the run-up to the G8 leaders' summit and will continue to work with them and others to agree commitments to advance trade, ensure tax compliance and promote greater transparency.’ Last month Mr Cameron hailed a breakthrough in talks to secure an Europe-wide deal on sharing information to stop multi-national firms avoiding paying tax. The Prime Minister said European Union agreement had been reached on tackling tax evasion and avoidance, after warning countries face 'staggering' losses.","David Cameron summons senior ministers from 10 British territories .

Tragedy: 10-year-old Eric Klyaz was shot in the chest Tuesday afternoon while playing with a friend in his Southern California apartment complex . Eric Klyaz, a 10-year-old in Miramar Ranch North, California, died Tuesday after accidentally being shot in the chest. The shooting occurred at an apartment complex on Ivy Hill drive, in a garage owned by a neighbor's family. Klyaz was playing with a 9-year-old girl in her parent's garage when a repairman heard a single gun shot and the girl screaming. He found the two kids in the garage and called 911 - dispatchers then instructed him on how to perform CPR. A neighbor, Mike Mee, also heard the gunshots and ran to the scene. Mee told San Diego 6 that he 'saw a young child laying on the floor in the fetal position with his back and there appeared to be a blood spot on his right side. Klyaz was on the floor, and the gun was laying on a nearby sofa. Police investigators said it was unclear yet whether Klyaz brought the handgun himself, or if the two found the 9mm semi-automatic in the garage. It was also unclear who shot the gun. The girl's parents were not home at the time of the shooting - her 14-year-old brother was in charge of her. After hearing the gun shots, Klyaz's father rushed out and found his son, who was not breathing. He cradled his son's head as CPR was performed on the boy. An injured Klyaz was rushed to Rady Children's Hospital, but was pronounced dead there later. Accidental shooting: Police investigators say it's still unclear who shot the gun or who owned the gun . The neighborhood clubhouse: The garage where the shooting took place was a popular place for the local kids to hang out, according to neighbors . Klyaz was a fourth grader at Dingeman Elementary, and had celebrated his tenth birthday the weekend before. Before the shooting, neighbors saw him riding his scooter around the neighborhood. Neighbor Michelle Rhea said he played with her children almost every day. Rhea described Klyaz to San Diego 6:'He was very sweet, he was very athletic. He loved to ride his bike and his scooter and he used to sound really creative and just - he was a nice kid.' Pending the investigation, the owners of the gun could face charges such as negligent storage of a firearm.","Fourth-grader Eric Klyaz was playing with a friend in her parent's garage when he was shot in the chest .

Celebrity Big Brother star and Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty has become embroiled in a betting scandal over matches in cricket's richest league. Shilpa, who co-owns Indian Premier League team Rajasthan Royals with her husband Raj Kundra, has been accused of placing bets on matches that her own team played in. The allegations were made by Umesh Goenka, an alleged bookmaker who is a witness in an investigation into a spot-fixing scandal that has hit the league. Delhi police chief Neeraj Kumar said that Shilpa's husband Mr Kundra had admitted to betting on his own team and lost 'huge sums of money' in the process, according to the BBC. Officers have now confiscated British national Mr Kundra's passport and told him he must stay in India. Police may question Shilpa too after Mr Goenka claimed that she had placed a bet on a Rajasthan Royals game against the Kolkata Knight Riders, reports India Today.

The blonde model was also given an Afro wig in an attempt to make the Dutch star look like Grace Jones and Josephine Baker - the inspiration for the Louis Vuitton A/W08 and S/S09 collections. A retrospective look at Marc Jacobs' work for Louis Vuitton, the magazine's Heritage Heroes shoot attempted to recreate Jacobs' inspiration for each season. Controversial: The May issue of Dutch Vogue features a shoot in which a white model has been blacked up . Star: The shoot features Dutch model Querelle Jansen, who has been made up to resemble Grace Jones . But Dutch Vogue's attempt to recreate Jones and Baker has caused outrage among bloggers, with many asking why the magazine didn't substitute Jansen for a black model for those shots. Fashionista.com's Dhani Mau wrote: 'A couple of alternative ideas: use a model who already looks something like Grace Jones or Josephine Baker without face paint. 'Or just, you know, don’t paint a white person’s face black ever? Why is this even something we have to keep pointing out? European editors and stylists especially, it seems, are really not getting it.' However, it seems that not everyone is convinced. Commenting on the site, Alexandrea Merrill wrote: 'So would it be offensive if the makeup were green....or blue.....or yellow....? Because it was dark facepaint there is an imagined issue and therefore must be racist? 'I don't remember anyone screaming racism when Asian inspired pictorials featuring women of all colors in kabuki face paint or wearing ""Asian"" styled hair extensions. 'It seems so many are set to find offense in anything and everything these days. You ""guess"" that the pictorial is inspired by a particular collection? So based on your personal ""guess"" you cry racism? 'We have all justified outrageous outfits, demanding that fashion is art, and expression of influences and personal experiences and imagination, but it can't just be art when we like it. Sorry Dhani Mau, but you need to get over yourself.' Inspiration: Marc Jacobs was inspired by cabaret star, Josephine Baker (left) and Grace Jones (right) Others hit back, with 'everything' saying: 'You are soooo offended that people get offended by things. You are ridiculous and tone deaf. 'Blackface is racist. If NOTHING else in the world is racist, blackface is.' The controversy comes in the wake of a shoot called African Queen in French magazine Numero, which featured a heavily bronzed white model. 'It's impossible to look at this and not ache for young women of color who want to pursue careers in modelling,' said Jezebel blogger, Laura Beck at the time. 'If jobs for ""African Queen"" photo spreads aren't going to black women, what hope is there?'

Prince Charles has expressed an interest in Wentworth Woodhouse but is not yet directly involved in the project to save it . Prince Charles has expressed an interested in saving Britain's largest stately home, it was reported today. Wentworth Woodhouse, near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, is a 365-room house which is twice as wide as Buckingham Palace. The majestic house, built in the early 18th century, was in the hands of the country's wealthiest family after the Royals, the Fitzwilliams, from the late 18th-century to 1989. But it was bought for just £1.5million by the Newbold family in 1999 because it was damaged by extensive mining in the region in the late 1940s which seriously affected its structure. Its current owners are trying to sue the Coal Authority for £100million compensation and hope to use the money to restore the building. Prince Charles, who has been on a private visit to the stately home, has received a letter from Marcus Binney, chair of Save Britain's Heritage, setting out plans to set up a trust to save the property. The Prince has spoken to ministers about his interest in the house, the Sunday Times reported, but is not directly involved and is not expected to fund the project. The enormous Grade I-listed house is 606ft across the front - the widest in Europe - and has more than 1,000 windows. It is so large inside guests regularly got lost going back to their rooms after dinner so had to lay trails of confetti to find their way. Owner Clifford Newbold and his sons Paul, Marcus and Giles, who live in a small section of the building, have already spent £5million keeping the house going, on top of legal fees. The restoration project is expected to be a mammoth task. Already it has taken 60 electricians to rewire the house. Wentworth Woodhouse, near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, is Britain's largest stately home . The Newbold family bought the house in a dilapidated state in 1999 for just £1.5million but have already ploughed £5million into its upkeep . The house's current owners hope a trust will be set up to fund the restoration project . The front of the house is 606ft wide - twice the width of Buckingham Palace - and it has more than 1,000 windows . And when the owners decided to redecorate some of the more elaborate furnishings it caused a national shortage of gold leaf. In addition to any money they are granted through the courts from the Coal Authority, they are also hoping to receive support from the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the Heritage Lottery Fund. They want to turn part of the building into a hotel, spa and conference centre, leaving other wings open to the public, including incorporating a museum into the house. Giles Newbold told the newspaper: 'We have spent at least £5m trying to . keep the house going but there is only so much that we as a family can . put in. And then there has been the cost of the legal case. 'We just hope that finally we can bring this place back to its former glory.' The structure of the 365-room home was badly damaged by extensive coal mining in the region in the late 1940s . It will take millions to restore every room in the house, including the gymnasium pictured here, to its former glory . The owners are currently in a court battle to get £100million in compensation from the Coal Authority . Peter Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, the 8th Earl, died in a 1948 plane crash in the south of France . Wentworth Woodhouse was built in the 18th century for the Rockingham family. The wealthy family included the second marquess, Charles Watson-Wentworth who was prime minister twice. The Fitzwilliam family inherited Wentworth Woodhouse in the late 18th-century and remained owners until 1989. As a family, they were the subject of numerous scandals. Billy Fitzwilliam, the 7th Earl, was accused of being a changeling who was swapped with an unwanted girl at birth. He had to defend his rights to the estate in court. But his son Peter did little to respect his father's struggle to keep the property in the family. He spent most of his time on the French Riviera womanising and hanging out with the son of the Aga Khan, Aly Khan. Peter was seeing John F Kennedy's sister Kathleen, but both died in a plane crash in 1948. In a separate scandal, George Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, grandson of the 5th Earl, married Evie, a former chorus girl. She in turn was so upset when her oldest son married a chorus girl she declared him illegitimate and disinherited him.","Wentworth Woodhouse near Rotherham needs restoration .

Victim: Daniel Pelka, four, was left looking like a 'concentration camp victim' after being starved, the jury has been told . A four-year-old boy allegedly starved and beaten to death by his parents was so hungry he scavenged food from a school compost bin, a court heard. Daniel Pelka later died looking like a . 'concentration camp victim' after suffering months of ill-treatment at . the hands of his Polish mother Magdelena Luczak, 27, and stepfather Mariusz . Krezolek, 33, the jury was told. The schoolboy was so hungry he would regularly scavenge food from other children and would  eat fruit left in the classroom, it was claimed. On Shrove Tuesday the pupils made pancakes and used some of the left-overs to do . counting activities and races carrying them in frying pan. Afterwards, Birmingham Crown Court heard Daniel retrieved one, covered in grit, from the bin. His teacher at Little Heath Primary School in Holbrooks, Coventry, Lisa Godfrey, said that on another occasion Daniel 'demolished' half of a chocolate cake during the lunch hour which she had planned to share with . the class to celebrate her birthday. Miss Godfrey told the jury yesterday that the young boy . 'looked like an old man' before his death. On his final day at school he had winced when she . playfully ruffled his hair. Daniel . is thought to have been killed in a ‘violent assault in his own home’ by one or both defendants during the following 48 hours. A . post mortem examination revealed he had suffered a blood clot on the . brain at the time of his death, and he had 24 separate injuries across . his body. He weighed just 1.5st (10kg) - 15lb (7kg) below what would be expected – with a body mass index so low it was ‘off the scale’. The jury were shown pictures charting the six months Daniel spent in the reception class of his primary school. Pictures taken in his first weeks showed a healthy looking boy. A picture taken at the start of Daniel’s final week showed him looking markedly thinner. Schoolboy: Daniel, who weighed just 1.5st, was caught taking food from other pupils and once retreived a pancake covered in grit from the bin, the court heard . Miss Godfrey said that when the teacher discussed Daniel's determination to 'steal' food with his parents, they insisted Daniel had an eating disorder which gave him an insatiable appetite. Struggling . to maintain her composure as she recalled his final week at the school, . the teacher said: ‘He looked sad. He looked like an old man. ‘I . hadn’t seen him look that bad before. He was very, very thin (with) big . black eyes. He was so pale I could almost see through him. ‘His eyes were sunken in to his head.’ Teacher Lisa Godfrey said that Daniel had the appearance of an 'old man' in the days before he died . She began sobbing as she added: ‘I . spent a lot of my time with Daniel that week because he looked so sad, . lonely and desperate and I didn’t know what else to do with him.’ She said she sat with him at lunchtime . on his final day at school, after earlier stopping him from eating a . pear she saw him retrieve from a playground bin. As usual, he ‘devoured’ his packed lunch and although 'subdued', he was alert and mobile. The court heard that in January last year, two months before Daniel died, she had noted in a 'concerns book' how the child had bruises around his neck. Mindful of Luczak's 'sharp temper', she told the jury she feared the marks could have been caused by his mother hitting or ‘trying to strangle him’. The following month, Daniel came to school with two black eyes and bruising across his nose, prompting her to go 'straight to the headteacher'. The court heard that in the autumn term, Miss Godfrey had twice contacted Luczak over concerns about Daniel stealing food from children’s lunchboxes - which eventually caused her to lock them away in a cupboard – and his poor attendance. When he returned to school after the Christmas holidays, she said he was noticeably 'thinner' than when he joined the school, with a 'large round tummy'. She added: 'I remember saying once that when Daniel had a hat on he looked like a child that had leukaemia.’ Miss Godfrey, who no longer works at the school, said that following the February half-term, Daniel was 'even more placid than normal' and even more desperate for food. 'It was like he stopped caring (about being caught taking food)', she said. 'He wanted the food and he would get it without worrying who would see.' Class teaching assistant Amy Tokely . said Daniel, who had very limited English, wore smaller clothes than a . lot of the children in the class. After February half-term she said it . was 'noticeable that his clothes were hanging off him and his attempts . to get food became more desperate.' Hungry schoolboy: Daniel, who went to Little Heath Primary School in Holbrooks, Coventry, pictured, repeatedly tried to take food from others, the court heard . Miss Tokely said Daniel would 'eat anything he could get his hands on'. His lunchbox, she said, initially . typically consisted of half a ham sandwich, a drink and a bag of crisps, . although he was later given a full sandwich. The jury has heard that both an education welfare officer and the school nurse visited Daniel at home during his time at school, and he was also seen by a consultant paediatrician, who gave his mother nutritional tablets. The tablets were opened but never used. Luczak and Krezolek, an automotive worker, dialled 999 after claiming to have found Daniel unresponsive in his bed in the early hours of March 3. He was pronounced dead in hospital. When police searched the three-bedroom family home in Coventry, they discovered Daniel had been locked in a box room akin to a ‘cell’, with no door handle. Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC told the court that Daniel had been 'subjected to a campaign of incomprehensible and escalating cruelty' by the defendants. The couple, who came to the UK separately in 2006 and began a relationship four years later, deny murder and causing or allowing the death of a child. The trial continues.

In another shot her hair is slicked back off her face with simple fresh make up, jazzed up with a pop of colour from her pink matte lips. Despite her plan for a drastic chop, the 37-year-old says that she finds having short hair can have its problems.

I owe Dr Deepa Apte, the gentle, softly-spoken medic-turned-Ayurvedic masseuse who slathered my whole body in fragrant sesame oil for an hour, a sincere apology. Some two-thirds of the way into my decadent session on her massage table, my consciousness suddenly plummeted into the most delicious state of sleep, prompting my leg (as body-parts are want to do when slipping out of wakefulness) to involuntarily spasm... kicking the good doctor in the face. It is testament to the power of her soothing hands and flawless technique that I managed so completely to leave life's stresses at the door of her North Greenwich day spa and drift off. The award-winning Ayurveda Pura practices the ancient Indian holistic medical system of Ayurveda - a 5000-year-old system of beliefs meaning 'science of life' and based on achieving physical and mental harmony with nature . But it also left me considering one of her full-body treatments ill-advised if your day's to-do list is as long as the Jubilee line: I left her spa deliriously calm, sublimely happy and went home to take a nice long nap. The award-winning Ayurveda Pura practices the ancient Indian holistic medical system of Ayurveda - a 5000-year-old system of beliefs meaning 'science of life' and based on achieving physical and mental harmony with nature. As a complete way of life, Ayurveda comprises diet, Yoga, massage, detoxification, herbal remedies, meditation and daily lifestyle, all aimed at improving a person's health, wellbeing, behaviour and state of mind. In other words: massages are essential. This is my kind of belief system. As Dr Deepa explained to me in her softly-scented room, Ayurveda sees everything in the universe - including humans - as composed of five basic elements: space, air, fire, water and earth. Ayurveda views illness as an imbalance of elements within a person¿s constitution. Its practice aims to restore balance and reinstate health . These combine as air and space (Vatta), fire and water (Pitta), water and earth (Kapha). And while every individual has within them all three forces, it is the concentration of each that makes up a person's individual constitution, or Prakriti. Ayurveda views illness as an imbalance . of elements within a person’s constitution. Its practice aims to . restore balance and reinstate health. And massage can do this. So, after holding my wrist and . determining my body type (Vatta-Pita: ambitious, hard-working, hungry, . medium build, often with a gap in teeth - all pretty accurate), Dr Deepa . lay me on her soft table. Unlike a deep tissue massage, a . Swedish massage or a sports massage, an Ayurvedic massage is a gentler, . smoother, more sensory experience. Instead of pumelling knots, cracking . joints and bending elbows the way they aren't meant to bend, Dr Deepa . slathered my whole body in comestible, herb-infused oils (in Ayurveda . nothing is put on your skin that cannot be put in your mouth) and swept . her palms over me, her hands never leaving my skin. Her touch - coupled with the soft, . plinky-plunky music, the warm, dark room and the soft bed - sent me . drifting off into sleep. Hence all the kicking. When the hour was up, Dr Deepa gently . woke me, allowed me to wash off the oil (she'd used enough to deep fry a . human whole) and poured me a fresh herbal tea while I showered, both to . rehydrate and to extend the glorious sense of calm and contentedness . for a while longer. As I floated back out into Greenwich . the world seemed somehow muted, less frantic and not quite so urgent. To-do list? What to-do list?

Part the hair in a deep side parting - straight works better than angled. 3. Take sections of hair of between 1-2 square inches in size and curl forwards with a medium barrel tong.

Do this all the way around your head leaving the parting you have made firmly in place. 7. Grab your section grips once more and place them around the hair to hold the curl waves in place. Make sure curled waves fall neatly all around the head and over the ponytail. Keep the grips in for as long . as possible.

Expensive new creams, lotions, scrubs and serums land on chemist shelves every day, each promising to reverse the hands of time and make our faces and hair smoother and more beautiful. But British women prefer something much more basic when it comes to maintaining glowing cheeks and lustrous locks, according to research. Rubbing coffee granules on thighs to combat cellulite and applying baking soda to teeth to make them whiter are revealed to be among women's weirdest beauty secrets. Putting cold damp tea bags on tired eyes made the list, as did using honey as a face mask . Other tricks include rinsing hair with raw eggs or beer to make it shine, and dabbing toothpaste on spots and insect bites to help them heal. The research - which delved into popular beauty regimes, habits and rituals - found that one in ten women would be prepared to try any tip, however bizarre, if it made them look better. And 10 per cent said they were a sucker for the latest beauty fad. Sleeping in socks full of moisturiser and brushing talcum powder through hair are also common. The extreme lengths women go to were revealed following a study of 2,000 by skincare experts Simple. Women in the survey also said they would be prepared to shell out £79 on average for the latest all-singing, all-dancing wonder product. Some women put lipstick on their cheeks when they run out of blusher . A spokesman for Simple said: 'This bizarre list of beauty tips and tricks just shows the lengths some women will go to look beautiful and how confusing some of these tips are.

'We wanted to poll women to find out what alternative beauty treatments they use and what their approach is to the latest 'must-have' products.' More conventional remedies to stay . looking youthful include drinking plenty of water, milk and cranberry . juice, the survey found. Other unconventional remedies include rubbing strawberries on the face to minimize the appearance of freckles and adding sugar to soap to exfoliate. Wrinkle busting tips were listed as sleeping on your back to avoid lines on your face and investing in a silk pillow case. The poll also delved into women's opinions of harsh cosmetic procedures, and one in five said those who go under the knife to stay youthful are 'vain and self-absorbed'. Nearly a third said they have 'more money than sense'. When asked what the key to looking young was, three quarters of women said it was maintaining a healthy diet. Two thirds hailed drinking lots of water as the key to keeping youthful, but 57 per cent said it was down to the genes you were born with. Baking soda on teeth to make them whiter came number 13 in women's top beauty tips . A third attributed it to a good daily beauty routine and religiously removing make-up. A dedicated 14 per cent eat particular foods in order to look young, with broccoli being the most popular, followed by oily fish. Two thirds said they find conflicting claims from beauty products confusing, but ten per cent said 'anything was worth a shot'. A spokesman for Simple added: 'This survey shows many women are prepared to go to extreme lengths to find the right beauty regime. 'Many women are prepared to go to extreme lengths to fight the aging process and that is their choice. 'But our advice would be to follow a healthy lifestyle instead of being pressured to try the latest fads or any invasive surgery.

Boris Johnson is to study Winston Churchill’s rise from political outrider to Prime Minister, in a move seen as research for his own political ambitions. The London Mayor has announced he is writing a book on the wartime PM, fuelling suspicions in Westminster that he is biding his time before bidding for the top job himself. Doing little to play down speculation about his hopes of succeeding David Cameron as Tory leader, Mr Johnson said he wanted to show how ‘one man can make all the difference’. Churchill Factor: Boris Johnson is to write a biography of Sir Winston Churchill, because hwa wants to show how 'one man can make a difference' Some might argue that as mayor of one . of the world’s great capital cities, Mr Johnson has enough work to do . without writing a biography on one of Britain’s greatest leaders. He already receives a reported £250,000-a-year to write a weekly newspaper column on top of the £144,000 as Mayor of London. But . friends of Mr Johnson insist he is a workaholic, and is determined to . press ahead with the book on Sir Winston for publication in autumn 2014. Publishers . Hodder & Stoughton said the Churchill Factor would focus on the . ‘character, life, legacy and meaning today’ of the former Prime . Minister, adding to the sense that this is not entirely an historical . work. The more mischievous . will no doubt look for references in the finished work to Mr Johnson’s . own hopes to swap City Hall for Number 10. Mr Johnson said: ‘I am interested in the memory of Churchill, and how it has been distorted.

A one-year-old whose face is paralyzed due to an extremely rare neurological condition is set to . undergo groundbreaking surgery that will see him smile for the first . time. Preston Tassi from Des Moines, Iowa, is one of several thousand people worldwide who suffers from Moebius Syndrome, which means he cannot blink, look side-to-side or move his mouth. However, doctors told KCCI.com that they are planning to treat his debilitating symptoms through a special procedure that will insert nerve and muscle tissue from his inner thigh into the jaw area. Expressionless: Preston Tassi from Des Moines, Iowa, whose face is paralyzed due to an extremely rare neurological condition, is set to undergo groundbreaking surgery that will see him smile for the first time . Preston's parents are now desperately trying to raise the $100,000 needed for the operation, often referred to as smile or reanimation surgery, which will take place when he turns five. Sarah Tassi said she and her husband, Jason first realized something was wrong shortly after Preston's birth on May 18, 2012. While ultrasounds had not detected anything unusual, they were surprised to see that he only had one finger on his right hand. Nurses were also concerned that he was breathing oddly and his eyes stayed wide open while he cried. Hoping to see their son smile: Sarah and Jason Tassi are desperately trying to raise the $100,000 needed for surgery to correct Preston's debilitating symptoms . After doctors assessed the newborn's condition, Mr and Mrs Tassi were called in to meet with a neurologist. An MRI scan confirmed that Preston had Moebius Syndrome. The incurable birth disorder prevents the cranial nerves around the brain from developing, resulting in an inability to move the eyes and face. In some cases it also impacts hearing. 'Just because someone may not smile on the outside, doesn't always mean they're not smiling on the inside' Other indicators include clubbed feet, missing digits and breathing difficulties. It is thought to affect roughly two to 20 births in every one million and a 2007 study identified 2,000 cases globally. Since birth Preston has been going to . weekly physical therapy sessions, but to restore control of his lips and . tongue surgical intervention will be needed. Mrs Tassi says that at the moment he is unable to eat unaided. 'As we feed him we have to hold his . cheeks in,' she explained. On the flip side Preston's motor skills are . on track with other children his age and he is almost ready to walk. In a bid to raise the thousands of dollars needed for surgery the Tassis have moved back in with their parents and set up a website called smilesforpreston.com. Step-by-step: Since birth Preston has been going for weekly physical therapy sessions . On their site they write: 'Preston is a remarkable little boy. Nothing is going to stand in his way. And we hope that sharing our story (his story), it will raise more awareness for others with this very rare syndrome. 'And for others to realize you can't always judge a book by it's cover. Just because someone may not smile on the outside... doesn't always mean they're not smiling on the inside.' Dr Nate Noble, Preston's doctor at Blank Children's Hospital, says his case will help professionals to better understand Moebius syndrome. Despite the challenges they have faced as new parents, Mr Tassi added: 'We just feel blessed to have him in our lives. Every second of it.' Moebius Syndrome, first described in 1888, is an extremely rare congenital neurological disorder which is characterized by facial paralysis and the inability to move the eyes from side-to-side. Most people with the condition have normal intelligence but they are born with complete facial paralysis and cannot close their eyes or form facial expressions. Other indicators include clubbed feet, missing digits and breathing difficulties. It is thought to affect two to 20 births in every one million. The disorder results from the underdevelopment of cranial nerves around the brain which control lateral eye movement and facial expression. Ocassionally hearing can also be affected. It is estimated that there are two to 20 cases of Moebius syndrome per million births. There is no single course of medical treatment or cure. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy are recommended to improve motor skills and coordination. Smile or reanimation surgery, which transfers muscle and nerves grafted from the thigh to the corners of the mouth, can be performed to provide the ability to smile.","One-year-old Preston Tassi from Des Moines, Iowa, suffers from Moebius Syndrome, characterized by facial paralysis .

He said the number of men having the procedure has doubled in the last year . Rising numbers of men are having laser treatment to remove hair from their ‘Hobbit feet’, according to doctors. They say trends for wearing flip-flops and sandals have made men increasingly self-conscious about the look of their legs. At one private clinic in London, the numbers coming forward for the £700 treatment to remove hair have doubled in the past year. Dr Michael Prager, a dermatologist based just off Harley Street, says he performs two sessions each day on men worried about looking like Hobbits from JRR Tolkien’s fantasy novels, in which they are described as having feet covered with curly hair and thick, leathery soles, making shoes unnecessary. He said: ‘The fashion has changed: men show more leg and they want their feet to look good. I think what you’ll see soon is a trend for men to have no leg hair as well.’ Margaret Dabbs, a foot expert with clinics in Britain and Dubai, said the number of male clients had grown substantially over the past few months. It takes about eight sessions of up to an hour to remove the hair from men’s lower legs and feet. The treatment involves using a laser that damages the follicles and prevents hair growth. The hair will normally grow back within a few months or years depending on the individual. Although it is often referred to as ‘permanent’, the hair will normally grow back within a few months or years depending on the individual. Ms Dabbs said: ‘It used to mainly be metrosexual men, but we now have the whole spectrum. Men are paying up to £700 to have foot hair removed in preparation for flip-flop season. Patients are said to be seeking professional help to avoid the hairy 'Hobbit feet' effect, that make-up artists created for Martin Freeman in the Hobbit (pictured right) ‘We have lawyers, company owners, MPs, even royalty.’ This is the latest trend that suggests men are becoming increasingly proud about their bodies. In January, the Private Clinic on . London’s Harley street reported that the numbers going under the knife . to have their so-called ‘man boobs’ removed had risen by 38 per cent in a . year. Dr Dennis Wolf one of the specialist doctors said: ‘I have certainly noticed an increase in the number of men who come to me to find out more about male chest reduction procedures. ‘Today men are more aware of the treatments available to them and are more open to the possibility of undergoing a cosmetic procedure in a bid to get the shape and the physique that they would like.’ Men account for ten per cent of all cosmetic surgery procedures - which doesn’t include laser treatment - according to the British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons.","Takes up to eight hours and £700 to remove hair from lower legs and feet .

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 18:28 EST, 19 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:54 EST, 20 May 2013 . Women are hiring private midwives to help them give birth on overstretched NHS maternity units. They are paying up to £5,000 for their own, dedicated midwife to ensure they get the best care during labour who can also offer advice throughout the pregnancy. One company, UK Birth Centres, claims that 200 women have paid for its top-up care in 18 NHS hospitals. It points out that while the women are in hospital the private midwives take on advisory roles while the NHS medical staff carry out the hands-on care. Breaking point: The Royal College of Midwives has warned that NHS staffing levels are unable to keep pace with rising birth rates . According to the website, they ensure women are supported ‘by someone known and trusted’ who ensures their ‘needs and wishes are respected.’ Recently senior midwives have warned that maternity units are at breaking point with staffing levels unable to keep pace with the rising birth rates. Mothers say they were left on their own for hours on end during the labour as the midwives were just too busy to offer care and support. Charlotte Ellis, 26, from Lichfield, Staffordshire, paid to have a private midwife from UK Birth Centres after what she described as a ‘horrific’ experience giving birth to her first child, now 10, in an NHS hospital. Strain: The British birth rate has increased by 19 per cent but the number of midwives has only gone up 12 per cent . She said the midwife never left the room while she was giving birth to her son Harrison two weeks ago at Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield. She said: ‘I wanted, this time, for it to be my choice and what I wanted. Not to be left for hours on end. ‘My [private] midwife never left the room. If she noticed something was going a bit wrong, she would say to the [NHS] midwife ‘Charlotte is getting distressed, I think you need to do this, this and this.’ Cathy Warwick, general secretary of the Royal College of Midwives has recently warned that maternity units are ‘teetering on the brink.’ She has said that maternity staff have told her that ‘the service they are giving to women and babies is deteriorating, and that safety is too often being compromised’. The College has also calculated that the birthrate has increased by 19 per cent but the number of midwives has only gone up by 12 per cent. It has also pointed out that many mothers are either older or obese meaning that there has been an increase in high-risk, complicated births. Jon Skewes, a director at the Royal College of Midwives said: ‘We are campaigning for 5,000 more midwives in the NHS to ensure quality and safety in the face of the increasing birth rate.’","Women are paying up to £5,000 for their own midwives in NHS hospitals .

Almost a fifth of casualty departments are being left entirely in the hands of junior doctors at night, an alarming report by the body which represents A&E doctors reveals. The A&E units have no consultants or any other senior doctors present overnight and are instead run by medics with a few months’ experience. The report, by the College of Emergency Medicine, warned that A&E units are ‘facing their biggest challenge in well over a decade’ due to ‘unsustainable workloads’ and a shortage of high-level doctors. A new report says junior doctors are in charge of fifth of all A&E units overnight . Already there is mounting concern that hospital emergency departments are in crisis and struggling to cope with soaring numbers of patients. Last week a senior doctor called them a ‘war zone’ as they were increasingly overwhelmed with patients let down by GP out-of-hours services, a rise in the frail, ageing population, and problems caused by the new 111 non-emergency service with patients wrongly referred to A&E by untrained call centre staff. A report today by the college shows there is a gap of eight hours overnight where no consultants are present at any units in the country. And in almost a fifth – 17.5 per cent – there are no ‘middle grade’ doctors, the level in between consultants and juniors. The report also showed that blunders such as scalpels being left inside patients which are known as ‘never events’ – because they should never happen – occurred in 6 per cent of all A&E units last year. The college examined the staffing levels, admissions and waiting times at 131 emergency departments in Britain. Dr Taj Hassan, vice president of the college and an A&E consultant at Leeds Teaching hospital, warned: ‘Because of the pressures we have there is no doubt that we have an increasing number of units that at times probably are unsafe or where they have serious safety issues.’ He said the lack of senior medics overnight was partly due to a national shortage of A&E doctors, with many regarding the job as ‘highly stressful’. There is gap of eight hours overnight where no consultants are present at any units in the country . Dr Hassan added: ‘There is a steady move in the NHS towards improving the amount of time consultants are present but obviously that can’t happen immediately. ‘We have to create sustainable and safe working practices which are attractive to future trainees.’ There are 22million admissions to A&E units each year, a rise of nearly 60 per cent in the past decade. The report says between 15 and 30 per cent of patients going to A&E could be seen by GPs. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, blamed the crisis in A&E on a ‘complete lack of faith’ in local GP out-of-hours services, ‘exacerbated by the complete erosion of public confidence in the NHS 111 service’. Labour health spokesman Jamie Reed said: ‘It has come to something when A&E doctors issue statements like this.’ A government review of A&E units and out-of-hours GP care is expected to report this summer. Last month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that since family doctors had been allowed to stop working evenings and weekends, an extra four million patients were attending casualty each year. Many areas outsource out-of-hours care to private firms which have been accused of putting profits before patient safety. This week the Mail revealed how the largest of these companies, Harmoni, was using nurses instead of doctors to cover districts with up to 250,000 patients.","A&E's have no consultants or senior doctors present overnight .

Barrister Robert Francis said he is concerned the nursing profession is not doing enough to raise standards . Nurses are not doing enough to ensure patients do not suffer callous treatment or appalling neglect, an expert has warned. Robert Francis, a barrister who specialises in medical negligence, said he was concerned the profession was failing to make urgent improvements. Earlier this year Mr Francis led an inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire scandal in which as many as 1,200 patients are feared to have died from neglect. He made a number of urgent recommendations for the health service about how to improve care – to ensure the tragedy could not be repeated at other hospitals. But Mr Francis said that while doctors and managers were taking action, he had ‘little cause for optimism’ that nurses were doing the same. The inquiry’s findings, published in March, described how patients at Mid Staffordshire had been left ‘unwashed, unfed and without fluids’ and ‘deprived of their dignity’. But it concluded that such failings were not a ‘rare event’ and almost certainly existed at other hospitals across the country. Mr Francis issued the NHS with 290 recommendations. In an interview with Nursing Times and Health Service Journal he said that, overall, his recommendations had been ‘well received by all the professions in general terms.’ Referring to doctors and managers he said: ‘They are taking this very seriously.

Now almost 15 years and several odd jobs later, Van de Velde has found his way back to the front of a classroom with a cleared name. Van de Velde, 53, was never charged in the murder of Suzanne Jovin, a 21-year-old political science major. But the slaying was so violent - she was stabbed 17 times in the neck and back and left to die on a curb - that Van de Velde was made a national pariah after he was named a suspect in the crime, in spite of the fact that police found no hard evidence tying him to the scene. In a matter of weeks, James R. Van de Velde turned from prestigious Yale University lecturer to scorned murder suspect in a high-profile slaying of one his students . Van de Velde says he was pushed out of Yale as a result and found it difficult to find a job anywhere else. 'I felt I was in some ways at the very top of a very successful career and I was dropped through a trap door to the very bottom,' he told the New York Times in an interview published Wednesday. Victim: Suzanne Jovin, a political science major at Yale, was murdered near her home at 21 years old . Fifteen years later, Van de Velde has won his first victory in the legal battle to clear his name. Yale University and and the City of New Haven announced on Monday that they had reached a settlement in his lawsuit against them, in which he claimed that being named a suspect violated his civil rights and damaged his reputation, career and health. He brought the lawsuit against the city in 2001 and added Yale as a defendant in 2003. The amount that Yale will pay as part of the settlement has not been disclosed. New Haven's portion comes to $200,000. Van de Velde was 21-year-old Jovin’s thesis adviser at the time she was killed. He told the police that he had been home alone when she was stabbed and left on a curb to die. 'I wasn’t a boyfriend, ex-husband, a work colleague. I had no argument with her,' Van de Velde said in a 2009 interview with The Associated Press. 'My DNA was not at the scene. I was not seen at the scene.' Following Jovin's murder, Van de Velde sought employment in the Defense Department, based on his previous employment in the naval intelligence reserves, as well as the State Department.

Pushed out: Van de Velde, pictured in 1998, says he was pushed out of Yale and found it difficult to find a job anywhere else . He was eventually able to get a position as a senior intelligence analyst at the Department of Defense, the Times reports. Later on, after taking the foreign service exam in 2004, he joined the State Department and began working for consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton as counterterrorism analyst. As he rebuilt his career, Van de Velde met his wife and they had two kids, who are now eight and three years old. He also picked up a job teaching a graduate course on intelligence and counterterrorism at Johns Hopkins University. 'I’d like to think I was able to rebuild my career through perseverance,' he told the Times.

Documents seen by the Mail reveal Harmoni has been offering doctors £150 an hour for a nine-hour shift because managers are so desperate to cover evenings and weekends. They are also offering GPs a £1,000 bonus for referring a friend to work for the service. Lucrative business: Harmoni, Britain's biggest out of hours care provider, is paying doctors £150 an hour for a nine-hour shift because managers are so desperate to cover evenings and weekends . The shocking revelation  comes a day after the Mail told how in one county, Harmoni was using just one advanced nurse practitioner to cover up to 250,000 patients overnight. But despite mounting concern about out-of-hours care, the Health Secretary insisted family doctors should still not be forced to work outside normal office hours. In a statement, Jeremy Hunt said GPs should not ‘necessarily’ be on call at evenings and weekends – as they were a decade ago – because ‘they work hard, they have families and they need a life’. Under Labour’s 2004 renegotiation of their contracts, GPs were allowed to hand responsibility for out-of-hours care to private firms such as Harmoni. But many GPs refuse to work for Harmoni, which has contracts in London, the South East, the Midlands and the West Country, because they are unhappy about care standards. Unless managers offer what are described as ‘market rates’, rotas would not be filled. Out of hours services: The shocking revelation comes a day after the Mail told how in one county, Harmoni was using just one advanced nurse practitioner to cover up to 250,000 patients overnight . The documents seen by the Mail include an email from a senior manager working for Harmoni which reveals how doctors have been offered bonuses for referring a friend. The memo, sent last year, reads: ‘I would remind you that there remains a £1,000 bonus fee for staff who successfully introduce a colleague to the service.’ As Harmoni and the other firms are paid by the NHS to provide out-of-hours care, this money effectively comes from the taxpayer. The documents also include desperate emails sent by managers to GPs begging them to work shifts that start in just two hours. One, with the subject line ‘Urgent Cover Need [sic] Today’, was sent to doctors at 11.43am asking them to fill two shifts, one of which started at 2pm that day. Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘This is an astonishing amount of money to pay for just one shift. ‘Not only does this place a huge burden on the NHS and taxpayers, excessive pay could encourage staff to work though the night regardless of their circumstances.’ There is concern that out-of-hours care is so poor that an extra four million patients are flooding A&E units each year because they have nowhere else to go. Yesterday the Mail published a series of allegations from a whistleblower, a GP who has worked for Harmoni in Somerset, which included claims that terminally ill cancer sufferers were being made to wait eight hours for pain relief. He also revealed how the firm was using advanced nurse practitioners to cover districts of up to 150 square miles when GPs could not be found. Referring to doctors’ hourly pay rates, a spokesman for Harmoni said: ‘We pay market rates which are appropriate for the day and time of shift being offered.’ Mr Hunt, who is overseeing a review of how the system must be improved, said yesterday: ‘It was a historic mistake to remove responsibility for those services from GPs as part of a contract renegotiation in 2004. ‘Not because family doctors should necessarily go back to being on-call in evenings and weekends; they work hard, they have families and they need a life too. ‘But when responsibility for those services moved outside the GP practice, the personal accountability for 24/7 access to general practice was destroyed.’","GPs are reluctant to work for out-of-hours care provider Harmoni because they are unhappy about standards .

The billionaire's over-the-top nuptials allegedly paying homage to Game of Thrones, which were expected to take place at the Ventana Inn & Spa in Big Sur June 1, hit a snag last week when Monterey County planning officials and the state Coastal Commission launched an investigation into possible violations of the building code. Parker, 33, is marrying Alexandra Lenas, a . singer-songwriter with whom he has a two-month-old daughter, Winter . Victoria, after a two-year engagement. The massive event, believed to be based on the hit HBO series, possibly with elements from J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings thrown in, reportedly would include set designs incorporating fake ruins, waterfalls and bridges  - all to the tune of $10million . Getting hitched: Sean Parker, the founding president of Facebook, is marrying singer-songwriter Alexandra Lenas this summer . Back in action: The grounds of Big Sur's Ventana Inn were swarming with workers loading trucks with huge industrial generators, apparently in preparation for Sean Parker's nuptials . Brace yourselves: One observer said the wedding could turn into a 'Game of Thrones' fantasy re-enactment . The construction, however, appears to have drawn the ire of California Coastal Commission, which accused the organizers of erecting edifices on the site with the necessary permits. “We have opened a code enforcement investigation on Ventana Inn,' Monterey County planning director Mike Novo told the Pine Cone. Neither the Ventana or Parker or his representatives have applied for permits, . Novo said. One of the wedding’s contractors promised county officials that . everything would be torn down after the wedding. Associate county planner Joseph Sidor said the state coastal commission is investigating as well.

The New York Post reported that the save-the-date cards for the June 1 wedding look like wizard scrolls. However, following the uproar over the permits, a source told MailOnline that the couple were 'strongly considering an alternate plan which would happen at . a different location in pebble beach'. And the source added today: 'Sean is considering various options.' On . Monday, however, the grounds of Ventana were swarming with workers . loading trucks with huge industrial generators as security guards stood . watch at the entrance to the 40-acre site, suggesting that Parker and . Lenas decided to keep their wedding plans on track. In 2011, the pair dressed as victims from the Alfred Hitchcock film 'The Birds' Game of Thrones is a popular medieval fantasy TV show on HBO that features knights and dragons and sorcery. Parker . is worth an estimated $2billion after becoming the founder of Napster . and other tech start-ups and working with Facebook creator Mark . Zuckerberg during the early days of the social network. He was portrayed in the 2008 movie 'The Social Network' by Justin Timberlake, though he has taken issue with how his character was portrayed. Parker proposed to Lenas, a singer-songwriter, in February after she gave birth to the couple's daughter, Winter Victoria Parker. The fantasy wedding won't be the first time the the couple has played dress-up together. They have been pictured during previous Halloween parties dressed as Justin Timberlake and Brittney Spears and as a gruesome duo from the Alfred Hitchcock film 'The Birds.' Meanwhile, this week it was revealed Sean and Alexandra are now living at the Plaza hotel in New York while their Greenwich Village townhouse is being renovated - and will be there for more than a year.

"By . Sophie Borland Health Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:03 EST, 12 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:34 EST, 13 May 2013 . Britain's biggest out-of-hours care provider is using senior nurses to cover up to a quarter of a million patients when they cannot recruit GPs to do the shifts. The firm, Harmoni, regularly employs advanced nurse practitioners to work eight-hour overnight shifts covering districts of up to 150 square miles. They have a greater range of expertise than a nurse, but critics say they cannot be expected to replace a fully-trained family doctor and attend emergency callouts. Harmoni, Britain's biggest out-of-hours care provider, is using senior nurses to cover up to 250,000 patients . At times of staffing pressures, there has been just one advanced nurse practitioner working overnight in North Somerset, which covers 250,000 patients. The revelations come from a whistleblower – a GP who worked for the firm in Somerset – who has made a number of other startling allegations about how the firm is routinely jeopardising safety to cut costs. They include: . The whistleblower said that working for Harmoni was like ‘taking a loaded gun and sitting with it because at some point it’s going to become so unsafe it’s going to go off. 'My personal feeling is that at times it has been unsafe. It’s a dereliction of duty. Everything is secondary to meeting budget. Patient care is compromised, employee care compromised. 'It’s an edict from on high. They have thinned rotas down to a bare minimum.’ A whisteblower said on one occasion a terminally ill cancer patient had to wait eight hours for pain relief (file picture) Harmoni has contracts in London, Berkshire, Sussex, Dorset, Hampshire, Milton Keynes, Stoke-on-Trent, Suffolk, Surrey, Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Essex and North Somerset. It is responsible for the care of millions of patients and makes £100million a year from NHS contracts. Many of its services are now accessed . by the controversial 111 service which effectively acts as a call . centre when patients try to seek advice if their local surgery is shut. But . the Harmoni whistleblower revealed that when shifts cannot be filled . with on-call doctors, advanced nurse practitioners are drafted in . instead. They are senior nurses earning up to £70,000 who have had extra training in advanced medical practice that allows them to carry out some tasks normally done only by a qualified doctor. Harmoni has admitted they are used to cover out-of-hours shifts elsewhere in the country when it is unable to find doctors. The firm claimed there would always be a GP on call at home to provide ‘covering support’. But the whistleblower, who has requested anonymity, said he was once telephoned by a nurse who was desperate for advice on treating a patient with a complicated condition. In March, he said, Harmoni was forced to draft in a nurse from Stoke-on-Trent to cover a night shift in Somerset. The whistleblower said many family doctors no longer volunteered to work out-of-hours shifts for Harmoni because of the intense workload. Instead, less experienced locum doctors drive down from London and do blocks of shifts spanning several days. Incredibly, the firm also relies on several European doctors who fly to Bristol by easyJet from Spain and Austria – and some ‘clearly struggle’ with the English language. The whistleblower said Harmoni assumed the English-speaking abilities of foreign doctors had been tested by the NHS trust. Last year, according to the whistleblower, a man dying of cancer waited eight hours for a doctor to give him pain relief. He also alleged that last month a manager instructed a junior official to change the figures on a spreadsheet for waiting times so they were more ‘favourable.’ A spokesman for Harmoni said: ‘On very rare occasions, and only after consultation and agreement with our commissioning colleagues in North Somerset that the service remained clinically safe, we have run an overnight shift with a very experienced advanced nurse practitioner providing the first point of contact with a GP available on-call to support with any advice needed.’ Harmoni relies on several doctors who fly from Spain and Austria and some 'clearly struggle' with English . When asked if this happened elsewhere in the country, Harmoni added: ‘Advanced nurse practitioners do have certain limitations on the care they can provide such as with very young children and palliative care. ‘Therefore, on the occasions when . they are the first point of patient contact, we ensure there is always . covering support available from a GP. For Harmoni, and indeed virtually . all out-of-hours providers, there are some occasions where filling all . the planned GP rota slots is a challenge.’ When . asked if staff were ever asked to change performance figures to make . them look more favourable, the spokesman said: ‘Our performance figures . are accurately recorded in line with national guidelines and, again, . carefully scrutinised by our commissioning colleagues.’ The . Department of Health said: ‘It is a legal requirement for the NHS to . make sure the right, high quality out-of-hours services are in place for . patients in their area. If this is not happening, it is totally . unacceptable.’","Care provider Harmoni uses nurse practitioners to work eight-hour overnight shifts when they cannot recruit GPs to do the shifts .

Daniel Veness, 23, attacked a five-year-old girl in the same month his sex offender treatment was delayed for six months because staff were off sick . A paedophile attacked a sleeping five year-old girl in the same month his sex offender treatment was delayed because staff were off sick, it emerged today. Daniel Veness, 23, had been ordered to carry out the treatment after being convicted of possessing over 600 child abuse images on his computer. However, two years into his three-year community order he had still not joined the programme. It has now emerged that the urgent treatment was delayed for six months because staff were on sick leave. In March 2012, when Veness was due to begin the Thames Valley Treatment Programme, he attacked a five-year-old girl as she slept and filmed the assault. Veness, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, was arrested three months later when a friend found the vile images. He was jailed for two years and eight months in April this year. Norfolk and Suffolk Probation Service, which runs the programme, said today there was no specific requirement as to when the treatment should begin but the delay has been criticised by politicians and the local Police Commissioner. Probation workers have revealed the treatment programme was delayed following a Freedom of Information request. It also emerged that five other sex offenders were due to start the delayed programme. Veness was originally ordered to start treatment after the first offence in March 2011 but a year later he had still not joined because he had been on holiday. He was eventually given two start dates in March and October 2012, but each time the scheme was postponed before being scrapped because of 'insufficient resources'. Norfolk and Suffolk Probation Trust runs the programme for convicted sex offenders . Norfolk and Suffolk Probation Service said the only legal requirement for treatment is that the defendant should complete the programme by the end of their sentence. But Conservative MP for Waveney, Peter Aldous, said it was 'highly unsatisfactory'. He said: 'I am very surprised and extremely disappointed that this information has come to light. 'If an offence is serious enough for someone to go on a treatment programme that should be carried out as soon as practically possible after their sentencing. 'I think in this instance a delay of six months before the course was reconstituted is not acceptable.' Suffolk's Police and Crime Commissioner Tim Passmore said: 'I find this approach quite extraordinary. 'As far as I am concerned as Police and Crime Commissioner one of the key roles is to look at the accountability and the public interest. 'While this delay may be within the law I would have thought common sense should have prevailed here and the required course or treatment would have been done straightaway. Local MP Peter Aldous said the delay was 'highly unsatisfactory' 'I don't understand why the course should have been delayed for six months. I find the whole process absolutely ridiculous.' Veness . admitted to offences of sexual touching, taking indecent pictures of a . child and downloading indecent images of children at Ipswich Crown Court . in April. He also pleaded guilty to breaching a Sexual Offences Prevention Order and failing to notify police of a change in his address under the terms of the Sex Offenders' Register. In addition to being jailed an extended licence period of three years was imposed on Veness because of the danger he represented to young girls. He was also ordered to sign on the Sex Offenders' Register and made the subject of an indefinite sexual offences prevention order. A probation service investigation into the Veness case has now been forwarded on to the National Offender Management Service. The Thames Valley Sex Offender Programme was designed to alter sex offenders' behaviour by changing their attitudes towards victims and helping them take responsibility for their behaviour. It is generally intended for male sexual offenders, aged over 21, who are sentenced to community orders.","Probation workers on sick leave when Daniel Veness was due to start .

And while the 26-year-old founder will receive an estimated $253 million in cash as well as a small amount of Yahoo stock from the deal, his loyal colleagues certainly won't go away empty-handed. Most of the core team have been with David since the early days of Tumblr and the first 30 employees stand to make an average of $3.6 million each, according to PrivCo, a New York-based research firm that tracks private companies and the venture capital industry. Thanks to their stock options, Tumblr's 178 employees will divvy up $66 million, according to Time. While after taxes, David will reportedly be worth about $190 million. They're rich!

Proud: Tumblr founder David Karp hugs his mother Barbara Ackerman at the Webbys in New York on Tuesday - just hours after selling his company to Yahoo! for $1.1 billion. David, a high-school drop-out, initially wanted to keep his company to a minimum, according to Tumblr's first lead developer Marco Arment, but as the firm expanded, they were forced to hire more staff. While some of the initial Tumblr team are not with the company any more - they will still benefit from the Yahoo deal and their joy is clear to see. This week, Marco blogged: 'I won't make yacht-and-helicopter money from the acquisition. But as long as I manage investments properly and don't spend recklessly, Tumblr has given my family a strong safety net and given me the freedom to work on whatever I want. And that's exactly what I plan to do.' John Maloney, Tumblr's former President, tweeted: 'Emotional day, I first met @davidkarp when he was 15 and we spent 8 years together across two startups, we put our hearts/souls into Tumblr,' before adding: 'Just bought some Yahoo stock.' 'Emotional Day, I first met David Karp when he was 15 and we spent eight years together across two startups, we put our hearts/souls into Tumblr' Mr Maloney first met David Karp while working for Urban Baby, of which he is a co-founder, and joined Tumblr in 2008 to help turn the site into a real business. Upon his departure in April 2012, David wrote: 'As a mentor he taught me, among many things, how to convincingly act like an adult.' Mr Maloney was never replaced after he left, although Tumblr has been looking for a new President. David admitted Mr Maloney was in charge of bills, investors, offices, hiring, lawyers 'and the thousands of emails that were sitting in my inbox...John magically put everything in order...John was the catalyst for everything Tumblr has accomplished.' Marc LaFountain was Tumblr's community director and third employee and now lives in Switzerland, where he is the CEO of Elixr, an app which helps you find the best watering holes in cities around the world. He was praised by Mr Maloney for having 'incredible commitment', and building customer support from zero, as well as being a 'lovely person and talent,' and replied on Twitter: 'Thanks so much, John. I learned a ton from working with you. It was an amazing experience!' Mr Maloney, who is also an angel investor and a co-chair of the Tech4Obama ‘12 Committee. also paid tribute to Jacob Bijani, Tumblr's product engineer and employee number five, calling him a 'massive talent yet such humility, positivity, whatever needed to be done, Jacob deserves some glow here.'

Forbes reported that with Yahoo’s acquisition of Tumblr, nearly a third of David's windfall will go to federal and New York state coffers following the close of his company’s deal with Yahoo. As a New York City resident, David will face taxes of almost 33 per cent since his payday – cash and stock included– will be treated as capital gains.

Smokers cost their employers an extra $5,816 annually compared to nonsmoking workers, according to researchers. The costs primarily come from higher health care expenses, excess absenteeism and lost productivity due to smoke breaks, according to the study, which was published in the journal Tobacco Control. 'This research should help businesses . make better informed decisions about their tobacco policies,' said lead researcher Micah Berman of Ohio State University. 'We constructed our calculations such that individual employers . can plug in their own expenses to get more accurate estimates of their . own costs.' The extra expense that an employer will pay on average for a smoking employee could run as high as $10,125, the study found. One . eight-minute smoke break a day could cost employers $1,641 annually, . based on the average hourly rate plus benefits ($26.49) earned by a . smoking employee. But the . researchers say it is more likely that employers lose even more money - . up to $3,077 annually - to smoke breaks, now that most companies ban . smoking directly outside of their offices, so employees must venture . further from the office to puff a cigarette. The larger number assumes that employees are taking two 15-minute smoke breaks daily.

Berman calls the cost estimates . conservative because, saying it even takes into account the annual . pension savings from a smoker's early death, which amount to roughly . $296 per year. 'Employers try to correct for the . idea that smokers cost more by paying them somewhat less,' lead . researcher Micah Berman of Ohio State University told NBC News. 'Even when we adjusted for that, smokers still cost more,' he said.

Future peace negotiations in Pakistan are now in jeopardy after the Pakistani Taliban's deputy leader Waliur Rehman was killed in a U.S. drone strike on Wednesday. Rehman was considered the best chance for talks with the incoming Pakistani government over his more hardline superior, Hakeemullah Mehsud, who remains at large. The Pakistani Taliban withdrew their offer of peace talks today, a group spokesman said. It is also widely believed that the Islamic militant movement has selected a replacement for Rehman. Killed: Wali-ur-Rehman, deputy commander of the Tehreek-e-Taliban, was allegedly one of seven people killed in a US drone attack in the North Waziristan region . Taliban spokesman Ahsanullah Ahsan . said the group is discussing whether Khan Sayed, Rehman's deputy, will . succeed him as head of the militant group's most powerful branch in . South Waziristan, which would effectively make him the . second-in-command. Two Taliban commanders said commanders voted in favor of Sayed at a meeting, but Ahsan said a vote had yet to be taken. Rehman was killed yesterday when drone-fired missiles landed on a house on the outskirts of Miran Shah, the main town in the North Waziristan tribal region. Four other people were killed, according to Pakistani intelligence officials. Two militants also confirmed that they had attended his funeral on Wednesday night but spoke on condition of anonymity. Journalists have little access to the tribal regions bordering Afghanistan, making independent confirmation of his death difficult. Sayed is believed to be about 40 years old and is known mainly for coordinating attacks in Afghanistan, say intelligence and militant sources. He was responsible for organizing an assault on a prison in northwestern Pakistan in April 2012 in which close to 400 prisoners, including 20 who were considered dangerous insurgents, were freed. Ahsan also told The Associated Press in a telephone call from an undisclosed location that the militants withdrew an offer to join peace talks because they believe the Pakistani government approves of the U.S. drone strikes, despite official statements to the contrary. He also formally confirmed that Rehman had been killed. Willing to talk: Wali-ur-Rehman, centre, was poised to take over leadership of the Tehreek-e-Taliban . Controversial: Drone attacks like the one that killed Waliur Rehman are a highly contentious method of tackling the Taliban and other militants . 'We had made the offer for peace . talks with the government with good intention but we think that these . drone attacks are carried out with the approval of the government so we . announce the end of the talks process,' he said. Three of the others killed were . mid-level Pakistani aides to Rehman, two Pakistani intelligence . officials said, also speaking on condition they not be identified . because they were not authorized to release the information. They said . they are still trying to confirm the nationality and identity of the . fifth militant. White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to confirm Wednesday if Rehman was dead. However, he said if true, Rehman's . death would deprive the militant group of its chief military strategist, . a man the U.S. says was involved in an attack that killed seven CIA . employees in Afghanistan. In 2010, Washington offered $5million for information leading to Rehman. Pakistan's incoming prime minister, . Nawaz Sharif, had said that he was ready to negotiate with the Pakistani . Taliban but Rehman's death has now deprived the process of a key . player. Sharif earlier this month criticised the U.S.'s drone strikes as a ‘challenge’ to Pakistan's sovereignty. This . drone attack is the first since the country’s general election on May . 11 where the U.S.’s use of the unmanned aircrafts was one of the most . debated issues. It followed President Barack Obama's speech last Thursday during which he pledged more restrictive rules on the use of drones. The Pakistani Taliban has been battling government forces for years in a bid to push them from the tribal regions, cut Pakistan's ties with the U.S. and eventually establish their brand of hardline Islam across Pakistan. North Waziristan is on the Afghan border . and has long been a stronghold of militants including Afghan Taliban . and their Al-Qaeda allies.","Pakistan Taliban's second in command killed by US drone strike .

The . only defect on the camera, which was a successor to the groundbreaking Leica I, is a small dent on the underside of the camera, which . resulted from the photographer dropping it which carrying out an . assignment. The photograph of the kiss, a 17.5x12in print . bearing Mr Eisenstaedt's signature on the back, also exceeded its estimate when it went under the hammer. It was expected to make about $22,000 at auction but sold for almost $31,000. However, the historic camera was not the most expensive sold at the auction on Saturday. A gold-plated Leica III 'Luxus', which had been passed down passed through the family that owned German sparkling wine company Henkell, sold for $682,366. The 1930s camera used for the iconic shot in 1945 boasts a Summitar 2/5cm lens . The Leica was widely used during the Second World War but mostly by the Nazis and Luftwaffe model was made . The camera, with a VIOOH viewfinder, went under the hammer at the auction on Saturday . German . firm Leica, founded in 1913, distributed thousands of cameras during . the Second World War - but nearly all of them went to the Nazi side. The company made a 'Luftwaffe' model for the German air force but at the same time as supplying the Nazis, staff at the company helped Jewish employees flee the country. The Leica III series helped pave the way for the small hand-held cameras which became commonplace in the 20th century. It was one of the earliest 'rangefinder' cameras, which allowed photographers to measure the distance between them and their subjects in order to make sure their pictures were in sharp focus. The IIIa was first made in 1935, and represented an advance on its predecessors by allowing photographers to use a shutter speed of just 1/1000 seconds. The model used by Mr Eisenstaedt is mounted with a Summitar 2/5cm lens and VIOOH viewfinder . Mr Eisenstaedt . bought the camera when he was living in Germany, before emigrating to . the U.S. at the age of 26 in 1935 as the Nazi government became . increasingly oppressive towards the Jews. Before . his departure, he photographed senior Nazis including Adolf Hitler, . whom he snapped during a meeting with Benito Mussolini, and Joseph . Goebbels, who is scowling in his photograph - apparently because he had . just discovered that Mr Eisenstaedt was Jewish. After settling in the Jackson Heights neighbourhood of Queens in New York City, he became a staff photographer for Life. Mr Eisenstaedt's work appeared on 90 covers of the magazine, showcasing stars such as Sophia Loren and Ernest Hemingway. He was awarded the National Medal of . Arts by George H.W. Bush at a White House ceremony in 1989, and in his . old age took a series of intimate photographs of the Clinton family on . holiday. However, his most famous work remained the iconic picture of the sailor and the nurse. Mr Eisenstaedt used the camera until his death, including for a photo shoot of President Bill Clinton . The photographer himself also stole a kiss from a woman in Times Square in 1945 . The back of the famous image is signed by Mr Eisenstaedt and stamped with copyright marks. It sold for almost $31,000 at auction . George Mendonsa, the sailor from the photograph, with his wife Rita Petry last year . The . first Leica prototype was built by the company Ernst Leitz in Wetzlar . in 1913,  but it was not until 1925 that the firm produced its first . commercially available camera. The . small, portable cameras became quickly popular, and established Leica's . reputation as one of the world's leading photography companies, which . it remains today. Like . many German firms, Ernst Leitz co-operated closely with the Nazi . government in the 1930s and 1940s - Goebbels encourage citizens to use . its cameras to produced idealised depictions of the Aryan race. However, behind the scenes the company was working to save its many Jewish employees by helping them leave Germany. Ernst . Leitz II set up what would become known as the 'Leica freedom train', . sending workers to its offices overseas to allow them to escape the . racist Nuremberg laws within Germany and start a new life in Britain, . France or the U.S. Leitz . never talked about his heroic deeds, which were brought to an end by . the onset of war in 1939, but Jewish groups have recently paid tribute . to his altruistic attitude. The identity of the two people in the . photograph is not entirely clear, but they are widely believed to be . George Mendonsa and Greta Friedman. In . 1979, Edith Shain wrote to Mr Eisenstaedt  claiming she was the woman . who was kissed, but experts later claimed she was too short to be the . person depicted. However, when Life magazine asked the . subjects of the photograph to step forward, a total of three women and . 11 men claimed to be the kissers. An examination of the sailor's scars . and tattoos soon suggested that Mr Mendonsa was the man, and he . identified Ms Friedman - who was a dental hygienist - as the woman. The sailor was at the cinema with a . date when news came of the Japanese . surrender, and he says he kissed the woman because he considered her . uniform showed she was part of the war effort. Mr Mendonsa's date, Rita Petry, would . later become his wife - she has since said she did not mind the . passionate embrace, which took place right in front of her, but added: 'In all these years, George has never kissed me like that.' Ms Friedman played down the significance of the kiss in later years, saying: 'It wasn't that much of a kiss. It was more of a jubilant act that he . didn't have to go back [to fight in the Pacific].' She also paid tribute to the upbeat atmosphere in Times Square on VJ Day: 'All throughout the day and the evening, people were there. It was like New Year's Eve, only better!' And . she had no idea she was being photographed when the stranger grabbed . her - she was just anxious to get back to her job at the dentist's .","Alfred Eisenstaedt used Leica IIIa rangefinder to capture famous image .

"By . Becky Evans . PUBLISHED: . 11:55 EST, 2 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:55 EST, 2 June 2013 . The popularity of British music is declining internationally as fans around the world choose to listen to music produced in their own country instead. Britain's share of the global pop charts has steadily dropped since the so-called British Invasion of the 1960s when The Beatles and the Rolling Stones ruled the world. Research shows that while Britain is still punching above its weight, music fans are increasingly choosing to listen to songs produced by domestic artists. Flying the flag: Dido and Robbie Williams were the only Brits to feature on a list of international 'superstars' Economists Joel Waldfogel, a professor at . Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota, and his . co-author Fernando Ferreira took data from the charts of 22 countries between 2001 and 2007 - which represented 98 per cent of the global music market. The project, which looked at the work of 23,000 artists, found that during the 1960s 30 per cent of music in the charts was made by a Brit. Since then it has steadily declined after a brief jump in the mid-80s when bands like Duran Duran and Wham! were the most popular groups in the world. The popularity of American music has continued to grow but the emergence of the internet has also helped artists from smaller countries. According to the economists, 31 artists appeared in at least 18 country's charts simultaneously for at least a year between 2001 and 2007. Twenty-three, such as Backstreet Boys, Christina Aguilera, Eminem, and Jennifer Lopez, were from the U.S. British invasion: British artists made up 30 per cent of the international charts in the 1960s but its share has declined almost continuously since . Industry boost: Bands like Duran Duran (pictured) and Wham! helped increase British share in the 1980s . Only 31 artists across the world featured simultaneously in 18 countries's pop chats for at least one year: . U.S. artists: Avril Lavigne - (Canadian but first album made in the U.S) Backstreet Boys . Beyonce . Black Eyed Peas . Britney Spears . Christina Aguilera . Destiny's Child . Eminem . Enrique Iglesias (Spanish but first album made in the U.S.) Evanescense . Faith Hill . Gnarls Barkley . Gwen Stefani . Jennifer Lopez . Justin Timberlake . Madonna . Mariah Carey . Outkast . P!Nk . Red Hot Chili Peppers . Rihanna . Usher . Vanessa Carlton . UK artists: Dido and Robbie Williams . OTHERS . Kylie Minogue (AUS) Las Ketchup (SPN) Nelly Furtado (CAN) Shaggy (JAM) Shakira  (COL) T.A.T.U. (RUS) Just two Brits - Dido and Robbie Williams - made it onto the elite list. American music currently makes up 60 per cent of the charts, up from about 40 per cent in the mid-1980s. Despite U.S. dominance in the list of 'superstars', Waldfogel and Ferreira said the amount of music bought by indigenous stars is also on the rise. In the 1980s about half of the music bought was by domestic artists but by 2007 that had increased to 70 per cent. They credited the growth of the internet and MTV as helping to 'democratise' music and help increase the popularity of home-grown artists. The authors said: 'Some smaller countries actually benefit substantially in this global market, as they are able to achieve market shares that are sometimes two or three times larger than the relative sizes of their economies. 'Moreover, new technologies that lower trade costs do not appear to have a destructive effect on local production and consumption of music.' It is not all bad news for the British music industry either. The UK is one of just six countries - alongside Sweden, New Zealand, the U.S., Finland and Canada - whose music industry share is greater than their relative GDP share. The report, published in the Economic Journal, found: 'Despite widespread fears about American dominance, music trade is roughly proportional to countries' GDPs' British music sales were 52 per cent higher than its relative world GDP share. Sweden - the home of the likes of Roxette and the Cardigans - had sales 59 per cent above its GDP, compared to America's 33 per cent. Waldfogel said far from killing diversity in the music industry,  MTV and the growth of the internet has actually had a positive effect. He said: 'Overall, our findings suggest that concern about cultural domination by large economies – particularly the US – may be misplaced for music.' Although, the study does not include digital sales in the past six years, the trend suggests the internet will continue to help artists, such as South Korea's Psy, reach a global audience.

Black sacks are overflowing on the streets and communal bins are threatening to become a haven for rats and seagulls. Mountains of rubbish have been left to rot on the streets of Brighton and Hove after five weeks of dispute between binmen and the country's only Green Party-controlled council. Furious residents are now threatening to withhold their council tax payments in protest at the weeks of stalemate. A seagull picks open rubbish that has been left uncollected on the Brighton and Hove streets for up to five weeks . Some residents say that as well as seagulls they have spotted rats and maggots among the waste . The city's communal bins are overflowing with waste and bags of rubbish are spilling on to the ground . They have spoken of maggots breeding in their bins and say the filth has now become so bad it is a health hazard. Seagulls, a noisy nuisance that Brighton and Hove residents are used to, have now been joined by rats, which are ripping open refuse bags and scattering rubbish across the pavements. The ugly sight, reminiscent of scenes from the 1970s when rubbish went uncollected in many cities for weeks, has been caused by unofficial action by binmen. Five weeks of negotiation have so far failed and the local branch of the GMB union is now balloting for industrial action and leaders warn a walkout would cause 'major, major disruption.' The backlog was created when refuse collectors went on strike on the Wednesday and Thursday after the early May bank holiday weekend. According to The Argus, residents are now planning to withhold council tax payments until the backlog is cleared. George Mower, 66, told the newspaper: 'It is disgusting. I saw two rats running around it. It’s a health hazard. 'I’m stopping my council tax as a result. I’m using my car and it’s my labour so why should I pay? Let them take me to court if they want to.' Bins are overflowing with black sacks and recycling boxes are full with uncollected waste . Pavements in residential roads are strewn with rubbish and food and locals have warned it is a health hazard . It is not the first time the city has suffered as piles of rubbish infest their streets. In 2009, a bin strike brought Brighton and Hove to its knees. No rubbish was collected from the city's 120,000 households for a week. The latest dispute comes after town hall bosses announced changes to the way binmen are paid. For their part, the union claim the changes would leave binmen up to £95 a week out of pocket, whereas others in the department are getting a pay rise under the changes. The council says the workers who lose money will take an average of £1,000 a year pay cut. GMB branch secretary Mark Turner told Mail Online: '280 of our members will see between a £35 and £95 a week pay-cut. 'We are very confident on the result . of the ballot and it would see a significant course of industrial action . and cause major major disruption in the city. The Green-controlled Brighton and Hove City Council have apologised to residents for the disrupted service . 'We are amazed that a green council is doing this. In 2009 they stood on the picket line with us.' However, the city councillor Jason Kitcat wrote on his blog this month: 'The majority of staff, about 90%, will see little or no change to their total pay, and of those affected more will gain than see detriment. Any detriment will be compensated and we expect the total wage bill to rise slightly.' A statement on the council's website said: 'We do not know how long the disruption will last and we are sorry, but we cannot provide a normal standard of service.' It added: 'As a result of the ongoing dispute between employees and the council we are still experiencing targeted disruption to recycling and rubbish collections. 'This means more vehicles than normal are being found to have problems, some crews are not collecting additional waste beside a bin and are working more slowly. No employees are working overtime on recycling and rubbish.'","Rubbish and recycling has not been collected because of an ongoing dispute .

A postal worker claiming disability benefits after injuring herself on the job has been accused of being a liar after she appeared on The Price is Right and spun the 'big wheel' twice without difficulty. Cathy Wrench Cashwell, a grandmother from Fayetteville, North Carolina, said that she was unable to lift trays of mail after she hurt her shoulder while at work in 2004. But she pleaded guilty to fraud in federal court on Monday after an indictment claimed she appeared physically well while on the game show in September 2009. Caught: Cathy Wrench Cashwell, pictured with her husband, allegedly claimed disability benefits for an injured shoulder even though she was seen spinning the wheel twice on The Price is Right . It explained that she 'raised her left arm above her head and gripped the handle with her left hand' during her first spin of the wheel, WRAL reported. On the second spin, she 'raised both arms above her head and gripped the same handle with both hands', the September 2012 indictment added. But the game show, where contestants guess the prices of items and then spin the wheel for more money, was not the only time Cashwell was caught allegedly swindling her employers.

A four-year-old boy who was allegedly starved and murdered by his mother and stepfather tried to eat the core of a piece of fruit after taking it out of a school bin, a court heard today. Teaching assistant Beatrice O'Brien said she and other members of staff watched Daniel Pelka reach into a bin in the playground on one occasion and ‘pick out either the core of an apple or a pear’. She said shortly before his death he felt ‘like a bag of bones’ and his skin was ‘ashen-coloured’. Schoolboy: Daniel Pelka, four, allegedly died from a head injury after an 'incomprehensible' campaign of abuse . Daniel, of Coventry, West Midlands, allegedly died from a head injury after an ‘incomprehensible’ campaign of abuse at the hands of Magdelena Luczak, 27 and her partner Mariusz Krezolek, 33. On day three of their trial at Birmingham Crown Court, the jury heard that teachers at Little Heath Primary School watched inside the staffroom from 30ft away as Daniel reached into a bin. ‘We watched him walk up to the bin, look to see if anyone was looking and pick out either the core of an apple or a pear and he started to eat it,’ Mrs O'Brien said. Later that same day, she said he took an empty tube of yoghurt from a bin in the classroom ‘and was trying to get the last bit of yoghurt out’. ‘I said to him “Oh no Daniel, don't do that”,’ she added. The problem of Daniel taking food in school became so frequent that Mrs O'Brien said teachers stopped punishing him, and started ‘gently’ explaining to him what he was doing was wrong. She said: ‘We started to think it was an obvious problem and almost became something he couldn't help.’ She added that the instances of him . taking food grew as time went on from ‘once or twice’ to ‘any . opportunity’. Mrs O’Brien said: ‘I believed he might have had some sort . of eating disorder.’ Evidence: Teachers at Little Heath Primary School (pictured) watched as he reached into a bin, the court heard . On the last afternoon he was at school, Mrs O'Brien said he tried to shell and eat ‘dried kidney beans’ that were part of the children's sandtable. ‘He had sand around his mouth,’ she said. Death: Daniel was 'quite solitary' and 'walked around with his hands in his pockets', the court heard . ‘Then I really noticed that the sand didn't really stick - there wasn't much saliva and his mouth seemed very dry.’ She passed her concerns on to colleagues at the time. When he first started at the school in September 2011, she described him as ‘quiet, he was small, he had a cheeky side’. ‘Sometimes he could be quite awkward or stubborn if he didn't like the look of an activity,’ Mrs O'Brien said. Describing how he looked on the last day he attended school in March 1 2012, she said: ‘I was very concerned. He did not look at all well and he had lost a lot of weight. His skin colour was ashen, it wasn't healthy.’ She added that he had ‘dark circles under . his eyes’ and said she tickled him on one occasion, because of her . concerns about his health, to find ‘he felt like a bag of bones’. Mrs O'Brien said Daniel started school with a smart haircut and well-fitting uniform, but towards the end of his life ‘he seemed to be wasting away’, his hair was untidy, and his uniform was too big for him. Mrs O'Brien said Daniel was ‘quite solitary’ and he ‘walked around with his hands in his pockets’. Earlier, headteacher Darren Clews said Luczak and Krezolek went to the school on March 5 looking ‘upset’ and explained to him that Daniel had died. 'We watched him walk up to the bin, look to see if anyone was looking and pick out either the core of an apple or a pear and he started to eat it' Beatrice O'Brien, teaching assistant . Afterwards, Luczak's barrister Stephen Linehan QC said it was accepted that his client had given Mr Clews a false account of the events leading up to the child's death. Mr Clews confirmed the details of the school's register showing that between September 14 2011, when Daniel started school, and his death in March 2012, he had missed 28-and-a-half days at school. Daniel, whose mother and stepfather came to Britain from Poland in 2006, was pronounced dead in the early hours of March 3 after paramedics were called to his home. Krezolek and Luczak deny murder and causing or allowing the death of a child. The trial continues.

Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude revealed that the Government has achieved savings of £10 billion over the past financial year . Civil servants waste three days a year waiting for their computers to turn on, it emerged today. As minister trumpeted saving £10billion in the last year by changing the way Whitehall works, officials admitted slow IT systems had cost the taxpayer time and money. Senior advisers said the government has been paying 'top dollar' for services but has not been getting the best service. Stephen Kelly, the Government's new chief operating officer, said: 'I came into the office and I pressed my PC and it took me seven minutes to boot up. 'That's government in the old world, that's three days of the year I waste of my time booting up,' the Standard reported. 'I think the average cost of a desktop [computer] a year is about £6,000. You could go and buy 10 iPads a year.' His comments came as Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude boasted that the government has secured savings of £10 billion over the past financial year, a 25 per cent increase on their target. He said the Cabinet Office was charged £57 for a PC power cable which is on Amazon for £20 and can be bought wholesale for £8. According to Government figures, the savings are equivalent to nearly £600 per working household in the UK. The Efficiency and Reform Group, run by the Cabinet Office and the Treasury, said it has effected the savings by cutting civil service costs. Measures include reducing the size of the civil service and reshaping civil service pensions, the centralisation of the procurement of good and services, improving online services, raising money from the sale of empty buildings and reviewing large-scale projects like construction. The Government had set itself a £8 billion savings target after the last general election. Mr Maude said: 'This Government is taking radical decisions to make Whitehall leaner and more efficient so Britain can compete in the global race. 'Civil servants across Government are changing the ways they work and we are on the way to managing our finances like the best-run FTSE100 businesses. 'I'm pleased to announce that this work has saved £10 billion, the equivalent of almost £600 for each hard-working family. These are popular savings which support Britain's deficit reduction and encourage growth. 'In the first year of this Government we saved £3.75 billion compared with the year before the last General Election. In 2011/12 we managed £5.5 billion. The unprecedented £10 billion savings last year shows we have defied expectations and accelerated the pace of reform. 'There can be no going back to the old, wasteful ways of doing things which we saw in the past. 'We know there's a long way still to go to achieve our ambitious plans for savings over the next few years. Hard-working taxpayers rightly expect their money to be spent judiciously. 'The Efficiency and Reform Group are the taxpayers' champions in Whitehall. Cash to splash: The £10bn of savings are equivalent of nearly £600 for every hard-working family . 'I am determined to push ahead with this savings programme and I would like to thank all the civil servants who have worked to make it happen so far.' Chief secretary to the treasury Danny Alexander said: 'This is a good result and a testament to the hard work being done by departments into making Government as lean as possible. 'There is a great deal more to do before Government is as efficient as it needs to be - that's why in the spending round we will find another £5 billion of savings as a major contribution to reducing the deficit in 2015/16. 'Cutting waste means taxpayers' money can be focused on building a stronger economy in a fairer society.'","Savings made by cutting civil service costs and reshaping pensions .

New Children's Laureate Malorie Blackman plans to use her two-year tenure to 'bang the drum' for diversity . Parents can be put off buying a book if it has a black character on the front cover, the new Children's Laureate has said. Malorie Blackman, the 51-year-old author of dozens of books including the award-winning Noughts & Crosses series for teenagers, has said there was still a need for 'more ethnically diverse literature in this country'. The author, from London, has said she will use her two-year tenure to 'bang the drum' for diversity. She said there was a lack of black and Asian children in picture books and described feeling 'totally invisible' when she was younger due to never reading a book that featured a black child, The Telegraph has reported. She said: 'Children will go with any story as long as it's good but white adults sometimes think that if a black child's on the cover it is perhaps not for them. 'Books teach children to see the world through the eyes of others and empathise with others. It's about the story.' She said there was still a need for 'more ethnically diverse literature in this country'. She also told the paper she wanted to spend her time as laureate focusing on older children and teenagers. The mother-of-one, who worked as a computer programmer before becoming a full-time writer 23 years ago, said she will use her position to be an 'advocate' for public libraries and campaign against 'short-sighted' closures. She said she owed her success to her local libraries when she was growing up in Lewisham, south-east London. She said: 'Each laureate can bring their own passions to it, but one of my passions is the public library service and I wouldn't have become an author and I certainly wouldn't have been standing here now as the Children's Laureate if it had not been for my local library service so that's definitely something I want to be an advocate for and cherishing our libraries and speaking out against library closures as well. The author said she will use her position to be an 'advocate' for public libraries and campaign against 'short-sighted' closures . 'I will do everything I can to ensure our library service is maintained or improved especially when you look at other countries like South Korea which in 2012 initiated a programme to actually build 180 libraries and Russia are building libraries and we seem to be closing them and I just think its a very short-sighted move.' The author, whose novel Pig-Heart Boy was shortlisted for the Carnegie Medal and made into a BBC series, said it was 'a real honour' to be chosen for the role and that children's books needed a champion. Blackman, who lives in Kent, follows previous holders of the role include Quentin Blake and Jacqueline Wilson.","Malorie Blackman said she will use position to 'bang the drum' for diversity .

John Bercow was at the centre of a storm last night after claiming migrants work harder than the British. The Commons Speaker said the arrival of thousands of migrants from Eastern Europe has had great advantages for Britain. He spoke of an ‘important wave’ of people that have come in recent years and praised their work ethic over that of the British. The remarks raised questions about the strict political neutrality required from his office and led to an accusation that he had behaved ‘disgracefully’. Speaking on a visit to the Romanian parliament in Bucharest, Mr Bercow said: ‘I believe things should be controlled and monitored when it comes to migration – any state that wants to protect its own people should do this – but there are also great advantages. ‘I want to underline the fact that there has been an important wave of immigrants that came to Great Britain from new member states and in many cases they came with aptitudes and a commitment, an involvement we haven’t always seen in our labour force.’ The remarks drew a furious reaction from some fellow  politicians, including Nigel Farage, the UK Independence Party leader who challenged Mr Bercow at the last election. Last night he said: ‘It is outrageous that Mr Bercow is happy to overthrow the wisdom of ages and think it acceptable to comment on matters that are both highly political and deeply contentious. He is a disgrace to the office of Speaker. ‘There are very good practical and constitutional reasons why the Speaker is neutral, reasons that he obviously believes are beneath his own august self image.’ Speaking on a visit to the Romanian parliament in Bucharest, Mr Bercow said: ¿I believe things should be controlled and monitored when it comes to migration... but there are also great advantages' The Speaker criticised sections of the media for raising questions about immigration, claiming there had been negative and discriminatory reporting on the issue. He suggested media coverage of immigration did not reflect the views of Parliament or the Government. ‘A free media is a vital part of a democracy,’ he added. ‘But the media is not the Government and it is not Parliament. I am here as a friend of Romania and someone who sees the benefits of immigration.’ Nigel Farage said Bercow was 'a disgrace to the office of Speaker' Rob Wilson, a Conservative MP who has previously questioned Mr Bercow’s political bias, said: ‘Immigration is an incredibly important and sensitive matter that generates very strong opinions. ‘The Speaker needs not only to be neutral in his handling of debates on the issue, but he needs to be seen to be neutral. ‘It would be a dangerous precedent if a Speaker were to start airing their views too freely on a subject like this.’ However Philip Hollobone, a Conservative MP who has criticised loose immigration rules, said he did not object to Mr Bercow’s remarks. He said: ‘As Speaker of the House of Commons, it is absolutely right that if he is asked a question, he is able to answer it freely and honestly.’ Ministers have promised a series of measures designed to limit the scale of immigration from Romania and Bulgaria when transitional controls are lifted in the New Year, including limits on rights of incomers to claim benefits and use the NHS or other public services.","Made remarks on a visit to the Romanian parliament in Bucharest .

A British boy was left critically ill in a Turkish hospital as doctors fought to save his legs - after he was crushed by a careering car during a holiday stroll. Mark Lalor-Smith, ten, was rushed to intensive care at the Akdeniz University Hospital in Antalya to be treated for severe injuries after the out-of-control car crushed him against a wall on Monday. He is understood to be on his way back to Britain for more specialist treatment. Mark Lalor Smith (centre) has reportedly lost his legs after being involved in the horrific accident . Harrowing amateur video footage of the aftermath of the horror crash, played on a Turkish website, shows young Mark laying prone in the road while his distraught father Julian and mother Sara cradle him in their arms. A female British voice can be heard shouting threats at the driver responsible for the horror crash, while Mr Lalor-Smith, 54, a senior civil servant on the Isle of Man, tends to his son. In the video Mark is lying immobile while a pool of blood spreads beneath him. The sun is shining, but tears and cries of anguish fill the air as the family desperately seek help, imploring passers by to phone an ambulance. Mark had set out for a holiday walk in the sunshine with his parents and twin siblings, Terence and Courtney, 11, to get from their hotel in Fethiye in Antalya on the Mediterraean coast, to a nearby restaurant. According to eye-witness Ugur Etiman, the car driver responsible lost control and crashed into a van before spinning into Mark and slamming him into a wall. Mrs Etiman said the scene was ‘horrible’ and described Mark’s legs as ‘torn’.  A passing Danish tourist administered first aid to Mark at the scene. Mark was rushed to the local Lokman . Hekim hospital in Fethiye (pictured) where he was stabilised before being . transferred 125miles to the regional university teaching hospital on . Turkey’s south coast . Mark was rushed to the local Lokman Hekim hospital in Fethiye where he was stabilised before being transferred 125miles to the regional university teaching hospital on Turkey’s south coast. A spokeswoman for the Akdeniz University Hospital confirmed:  ‘Mark is currently in intensive care.  He’s suffered extensive injuries to both legs but the doctors are currently trying to repair his arteries and restore blood supply to his feet. 'They are doing everything they can to repair the damage and save his legs. It’s too early to say the outcome. ‘His parents, Sarah and Julian  are with him and are in constant contact with the doctors about his progress any decisions about amputation will be made in consultation with them.’ The family declined to comment. But Turkish video footage last night showed Mr Lalor-Smith and the rest of the family pacing up and down nervously in the hospital where young Mark is being treated. And on Mrs Lalor-Smith’s Facebook page – which is covered with happy photographs of the family together – she makes clear that they had happy holiday experiences in Fethiye in the past. She had last October written to an American friend living in Fethiye, saying excitedly ‘Just looking at flights for next year!’ Among Mrs Lalor-Smith’s friends is an instructor at a surf school in the town. Idyllic: But the family's holiday in Fethiye turned into a nightmare following the horrific accident . He and his family live in Foxdale on the island. On an internet profile Mr Lalor-Smith says he and the family enjoy walking their four West Highland Terriers, and that his is a committed member of the leadership of his church. Last night Isle of Man Home Afffairs minister Juan Watterson said: 'Julian is a popular officer within the department of home affairs - and our thoughts and prayers are with him.' Fethiye is a popular resort on Turkey’s south west coast. Known as part of the so-called Turkish Riviera, it has been increasingly thronged by British tourists over the last decade. Just 30 mins from the resort airport of Dalaman the population of the original fishing port swells from its 70,000 residents in the winter to hosting more than half-a-million visitors each summer. The majority of tourists are British followed by Russian and Sweden – with many Brits loving the climate so much that they have recently bought property in the town, developing British ex-pat enclaves in suburbs such as Calis Beach and Hisaronu. Olu Deniz bay, the poster beach of Turkey is ten miles out of Fethiye. But the town has seen its fair share of tragedy involving the Britons that flock there each summer. In Aug 2009 British tourist John Kirkham disappeared while walking the famous Lycian Way – a Roman route from Fethiye to Antalya.  His body was discovered months later where he had fallen into a dried up river bed. And the following year in July 2010 little Cerys Matthews, nine, who was holidaying in Fethiye died in a white water rafting tragedy. Despite the tragic holiday deaths many Brits have been surprised and impressed by the excellent standard of care provided by the Turkish emergency services – particularly the paramedics and state of the art hospitals.","Boy, named as Mark Lalor Smith, 10, pinned against the wall by car .

The revelation shows the full scale of the past abuse of the student visa system. The non-EU nationals faced removal from Britain after their bogus colleges were shut down in a crackdown by the Government. A Home Office survey over three months revealed that 50 . per cent of the ceremonies involved people who had first entered the country as . students (File picture) But, instead of returning home, they are arranging fake weddings with British nationals or EU citizens to prolong their stay, often paying thousands of pounds in fees to 'fixers'. Under a Brussels edict, marrying an EU citizen can grant the same rights to stay as marrying a Briton. Officials say the trend shows that the migrants' true reason for travelling to the UK in the first place was to settle, not  to study. Last year, they identified a suspected 2,000 sham marriages. A snapshot Home Office survey over three months revealed that 50 per cent of the ceremonies involved people who had first entered as students. The revelations came as the latest figures showed that while there has been a huge reduction in the number of student visas handed out, the number of  non-EU nationals going to UK universities is up by more than 5 per cent. This dispels claims by Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, that universities are missing out because of the Government's immigration policies. Mr Cable has repeatedly clashed with Tory ministers over student visas. Last week, he claimed that public 'panic' over immigration was harming the British economy. The number of foreign students coming to the UK was down 22 per cent to 190,000 between  September 2011 and September 2012. But officials said this was the result of closing bogus colleges and strict new rules on non-EU nationals attending colleges. Since 2010, more than 600 institutions have been barred from recruiting non-EU students. But rather than declining, UCAS applications from non-EU students are up 5.5 per cent compared with this time last year, and now stand at 59,324. The number of non-EU students at elite Russell Group universities was up 6 per cent in 2011/12 to 109,165. A Government source said: 'This shows that the message is getting through that our stricter rules will not enable bogus students to come to the UK, but that the brightest and the best are welcome.' Last month, the Office for National Statistics revealed that net migration to Britain – the difference between those arriving and leaving – fell to 153,000 in the year to September 2012. It means that Prime Minister David Cameron is on course to hit a key election pledge to cut net migration to tens of thousands by 2015. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migration Watch, said: 'Vince Cable is not only completely  out of touch with public opinion but also completely wrong on  his facts.' A Conservative Party source said: 'Net migration is at its lowest point for almost a decade, and is more than a third lower than when this Government came to power. The fall in immigration is in large part down to ending the widespread abuse of student visas.'","Figures come from a snapshot Home Office survey over three months .

The five men struck a total of 14 times in three months in the Ribble Valley area of Lancashire, stealing power cables at rural beauty spots at locations including electricity substations and farms. Police said the gang put their own safety at risk by stealing the live cables, which can carry up to 765,000 volts, as well as putting at risk the homes of the people served by the power lines. Gang members: Gabriel Predusca (left), 24, and Alexandru Beligan (right), 28, both admitted conspiracy to steal . Thefts: Marius Avram (left), 48 and Mahai Georgian Antonala (right), 28, were also in the Romanian gang . They went out in the dead of night and, after climbing electricity pylons, used professional ‘jumpers’ to isolate the power so they could handle and steal the copper cables. When arrested the gang had hundreds of feet of copper wiring, weighing over a tonne, in the back of a van. Also seized by police were boots adapted with a large spiked hook to aid climbing up poles. Thefts took place at the Ribble Valley rural sites of Clitheroe, Ribchester, Sabden, Dinckley, Hurst Green and Whalley. The cabling itself was worth £28,000 and the cost of restoring it was £90,000. In one raid, the gang, who had planned and were prepared for the stealing expeditions, caused an electrical flash when they were trying to steal cable from Clitheroe, and left empty- handed. They were caught in the early hours of July 3 last year, within hours of taking cables from Dinckley and Sabden, when stopped in a convoy of two vehicles travelling south on the M6 in Staffordshire. In the lead car were four of the defendants with ‘incriminating’ documentation, addresses and postcodes of sites where cables had been stolen. In the following van was a haul of copper. Evidence: When arrested the gang had hundreds of feet of copper wiring, weighing over a tonne, in a van . The gang members - Alexandru Codrut Tudor, 21, Mahai Georgian Antonala, 28, Alexandru Beligan, 28, Marius Avaram, 48, and Gabriel Predusca, 24, all from Birmingham, admitted conspiracy to steal. Antonala also pleaded guilty to disqualified driving and was banned for three years. Tudor was ordered off the road for two years. Beligan, described by a judge as the ‘driving force’ behind the plot, was jailed for six years. 'People are entitled to expect that those who did as you did will receive immediate, substantial, prison sentences' Judge Graham Knowles QC . Antonala got four and a half years, Tudor and Avaram were each given four years and two months and Predusca received 44 months. All had been allowed legally allowed into the UK. Mark Lamberty, prosecuting, told Burnley Crown Court that between March 29 and July 3 last year, there were 14 recorded thefts of copper cabling from locations in the Ribble Valley. They took place on four main occasions - March 29, mid-May, mid-June and on the night of 2 and 3 July. Mr Lamberty said on July 3, at a farm in Sabden, there was some indication of technical knowledge in that ‘jumpers’ had been cut in a manner so as to isolate a section of wire for safe removal. The prosecutor said at 3.30am, on May 22, a witness whose home overlooked a car park in the centre of Ribchester awoke, saw a small van, got his binoculars and noted the number. Aiding theft: Also seized by police were boots adapted with a large spiked hook to aid climbing up poles . On that night, cable had been stolen from Gallows Lane, near the centre. On July 3, a three-year-old boy in Dinckley woke his young mother at 2.30am, upset his bedroom light had gone out. That night there were two thefts of cable from the area. Mr Lamberty said police stopped two vehicles on July 3, at 5.20am. The driver of the first vehicle was Antonala, who was banned. He gave a false name. Avaram was the front seat passenger and he had two mobile phones on him. When he was searched in custody, officers found a piece of paper in his pocket with addresses in the Ribble Valley on it. At the farm in Sabden, there were marks on the poles, indicative of the use of equipment to scale up them. Also found in the car were boots with metal attachments which an electricity representative was able to identify as similar to pole climbing equipment. Police found postcodes entered by the gang on Google Maps were found to be in roads where overhead cabling was present. Sentencing, Judge Graham Knowles QC, ordered that the gang's car be seized. In the van: The gang went out in the dead of night and, after climbing electricity pylons, used professional 'jumpers' to isolate the power so they could handle and steal the copper cables . He told the gang: ‘This type of crime is prevalent across the nation, the conspiracy was successful and professional and you believed you would profit handsomely from it. It caused inconvenience and could potentially have put safety at risk. ‘People are entitled to expect that those . who did as you did will receive immediate, substantial, prison . sentences, to make plain the seriousness of the offence and to act as a . deterrent to others who may be tempted to steal in the same way.’ 'These thefts left hundreds of homes without power and were highly dangerous' Detective Sergeant Kathryn Cussans . After the case Detective Sergeant Kathryn Cussans of Lancashire Police said: ‘These thefts left hundreds of homes without power and were highly dangerous. ‘By cutting into copper wiring, thieves are not only putting themselves at risk but they are risking the lives of the residents whose homes are connected to the power supply. I hope today's sentence sends out a strong message that this type of behaviour will not be tolerated.’ Lee Maxwell, Lancashire area manager at Electricity North West, added: ‘These five men had stolen overhead power lines and caused major disruption to our customers. ‘Although the men have been successfully sentenced we still have a long struggle ahead as we receive reports of metal theft every day across the region. ‘This causes thousands of pounds worth of damage and affects livelihoods, critical health services and also vulnerable people, including the elderly.’","Five men struck 14 times in three months in Ribble Valley, Lancashire .

New Government regulations which would hurt small businesses will be 'reformed or binned', the Department for Business will announce today. In a dramatic attempt to crackdown on red tape, Michael Fallon will ban the introduction of new regulation by any Government department which would hit small firms. He is expected to say: 'On my watch, new regulations will now only extend to small businesses if they are essential, justified and where disproportionate burdens are fully mitigated. And where regulation is not fit for purpose it will be reformed or binned.' Cutting red tape: Business and Enterprise Minister Michael Fallon will announce changes today . The crackdown will come into effect immediately, and will apply to small businesses employing up to 50 staff. The vast majority of British businesses will benefit. Of the 4.8million businesses in this country, only 1.2million actually employ one or more people, according to official figures. It comes after red tape has for years been regularly cited by small firms as the biggest problem that they face. While entrepreneurs want to be focused on growing their business, millions complain their time is wasted on the constant mountain of red tape paperwork which needs to be filled in. Small business lobby groups have regularly warned their members are 'hammered' by red tape which they insist is thwarting Britain's chance of a full economic recovery. Today Mr Fallon will say he has listened to their fury about red tape, and promise to stem the flow of time-consuming regulation which distracts them day in, day out. Small business lobby groups have regularly warned their members are 'hammered' by red tape . He will say: 'We all want faster growth. As Britain recovers, small businesses are leading the generation of ideas, the creation of new jobs and the shift towards a balanced economy. 'We cannot afford to hold them back with more rules and regulations.' Last night, business lobby groups welcomed the move, which will affect all new ideas with immediate effect and apply to all regulations coming into force after 31 March 2014. John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: 'The burden of regulation often falls heaviest on the smallest of firms. 'This announcement should mean that business owners will be able to devote time to growing their business and creating jobs, rather than form-filling.' Alexander Ehmann, head of regulatory policy at the Institute of Directors, said they are 'much-needed powers to throw out rules which are unmanageable for the UK's smallest businesses.' Under the new system, all new regulations must be scrutinised by two committees, which have the power to veto them if they are deemed to be harmful to small businesses. Alternatively, the committee can grant an exemption to small businesses, or change the rules to mitigate the impact on small firms. For example, the rules around record-keeping for small firms – one of their biggest bugbears – might be simplified, but not for large firms. The British Chambers of Commerce said it will 'keep an eye' on the new policy to ensure that it is actually making a difference to firms, rather than just becoming another failed attempt to curb the explosion of red tape. It comes after the Prime Minister said yesterday he will accept all the recommendations made by his small business tsar Lord Young in his recent report. They include scrapping the age restriction, currently 30, on people who can apply for a popular 'start-up loan' from the Government to allow entrepreneurs of all ages to apply.","Department for Business to ban new regulation hitting small firms .

Dragon's’ Den entrepreneur James Caan was accused of ‘total hypocrisy’ yesterday after he insisted parents should not help their children get jobs – but failed to mention he has employed both his daughters. On his first day as Nick Clegg’s adviser on social mobility, Mr Caan insisted that job prospects should not depend on ‘who you know rather than what you can do’. He suggested children should be encouraged to make their own  way in life and that their parents should step in only if they were in serious difficulty. Double standards: New government tsar James Caan, pictured with wife Aisha (left), said parents should not help their children to get jobs despite employing his daughter Hanah (right) three times . However, Mr Caan, 52, a private equity . and recruitment tycoon and a former panellist on the BBC’s Dragons’ Den, made no mention of the fact that his daughter Hanah has held three . positions in his various ventures. Miss Caan, 25, who describes herself . as ‘sort of like Maggie Thatcher meets Paris Hilton’ on Twitter, spent a . year working at her father’s private equity firm Hamilton Bradshaw. Since 2010, she has been on the board . of trustees of the James Caan Foundation, which helps fund building . projects in Pakistan among other causes. And in May last year, she started as . an adviser with the government-backed Start-Up Loans Company, of which . her father is chairman. It also emerged that his older daughter Jemma, 26, works for a recruitment firm he part-owns. Later, Mr Caan sought to defend his . daughters’ appointments but admitted that, like any parent, he has an . ‘innate’ sense he should help his children in to work. Tory MP Brian Binley, a member of the . Commons Business Select Committee, accused Mr Caan of being ‘totally . hypocritical’, adding: ‘If parents aren’t there to give all the help . they can to their children then I don’t know what they are there for.’ Embarrassment: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is due to name Mr Caan as an adviser on opening up business to 'talent' tomorrow . Downing Street suggested David Cameron . does not agree with Mr Caan’s advice. ‘His view is every parent wants . what’s best for their children,’ a spokesman said. In response to the furore, Mr Caan, . who has been chosen to lead the Government’s Opening Doors campaign to . encourage businesses to have ‘open and fair’ recruitment processes, . insisted both his daughters were treated the same as other applicants to . his companies. He said: ‘I absolutely believe that . parents should encourage their children to explore their own . opportunities. The fact is that parents will always have the innate . feeling to help their children into jobs. I’m no different. ‘In my own situation, my eldest . daughter Jemma spent four years of pursuing many jobs to establish . herself on her own career path. More recently over the last six months . she joined a recruitment company that I have an investment in. ‘Despite my involvement she still had . to go through a rigorous recruitment process with a number of different . candidates and demonstrate her own abilities. ‘When my daughter Hanah... graduated . she volunteered in my then start-up business Hamilton Bradshaw. She . later submitted her CV and interviewed for a graduate internship . position within the business to enable her to follow a formal process.’ Speaking on Sky News today, he added: 'I find some parents have a very clear idea about what they want their children to do, but it is also important to understand what the child wants to do.'","Parents should only use influence if children fail to find work after year .

Whole Foods markets are re-evaluating their English language-only policy after two employees who questioned it were suspended at an Albuquerque, New Mexico store. It all started at a recent employee meeting at the Whole Foods store located on Wyoming Boulevard when a manager brought up the store's policy. The manager said that Spanish was not to be spoken during work hours. Two employees, Bryan Baldizan and Lupe Gonzales, wrote a letter to the manager questioning the policy. Don't speak: Whole Foods is facing heavy criticism after two employees were suspended at an Albuquerque, New Mexico, market for complaining about the company's English language-only policy . 'I could not understand how for Cinco de Mayo, we dressed employees up in sarapes and sombreros with fake mustaches but the language that is connected with that was suddenly forbidden,' Baldizan wrote in the letter. Soon after both Baldizan and Gonzales were put on suspension. 'I couldn't believe it,' Baldizan told the AP. 'All we did was say we didn't believe the policy was fair. We only talk Spanish to each other about personal stuff, not work.' Libba Letton, spokesman for Whole Foods, refutes that Baldizan and Gonzales were suspended for complaining about the policy. Instead, Letton says, they were suspended due to their behavior when meeting with the manager where they were 'rude and disrespectful' in an office. 'Their suspension was due to their behavior alone,' Letton said in a statement. Suspended: Bryan Baldizan was one two Whole Foods employees suspended for speaking out against the language policy . Ben Friedland, the Rocky Mountain region executive marketing director for Whole Foods, explained that the policy only states that employees speak English with other customers and workers when on the clock, unless the customer speaks another language. 'Team members are free to speak any language they would like during their breaks, meal periods and before and after work,' Friedland said. Friedland went on to say that the policy doesn't prevent Spanish-speaking if all 'parties present agree that a different language is their preferred form of communication.' The policy, Letton says, was put in place for safety reasons and so customers and other employees don't feel uncomfortable. The actual policy: A copy of the store's language policy shows that there is some flexibility as to when languages other than English can be spoken . Still, the Austin, Texas-based company is investigating the incident, and is in the process of evaluating the policy 'as we speak,' according to Letton. The policy, she says, will be a topic of conversation at the company's leadership conference next week. 'I'm glad they are willing to re-evaluate that policy because I think every state is different,' said New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez. The Spanish language, Gov. Martinez says, 'is part of the fabric of what makes New Mexico great.' What makes New Mexico great: Gov. Susana Martinez - the nation's first and only Latina governor - said she was glad that the company is re-evaluating their English-only policy . The company still faces heavy-criticism from the New Mexico League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). The director of the organization, Ralph Arellanes said Thursday he will give the company seven days to implement a new policy 'or we will hold them accountable.' Letton said the company will speak to civil rights groups when reviewing the policy. 'We are also in the process of reaching out to groups like LULAC to discuss the issue and hear their perspective,' Letton said. Seven days: Ralph Arellanes, director of LULAC, is one of the leaders speaking out against the policy.

An internationally renowned artist who molested young girls he used as models walked free from court yesterday. Child abuse campaigners said the  suspended sentence on 70-year-old Graham Ovenden was 'outrageous’ and sent out the message that such crimes are not taken seriously. But the judge said he had taken account of the artist’s age and his 'irreversibly tarnished reputation’. Ovenden, whose work has been exhibited at major galleries including The Tate in  London, invited girls as young as six to sit for portraits and photographs. Free man: Shamed artist Graham Ovenden, 70, pictured arriving at Plymouth Crown Court today, escaped with a 12 month suspended sentence . He would blindfold his victims and . make them wear Victorian nightwear before removing the clothing and . committing indecent acts, a jury heard. The artist was found guilty in April, . but left court yesterday after he was sentenced insisting arrogantly . that he had been the victim of a 'witch-hunt’ and had 'been through . considerable hell’. Asked if he thought everybody was . wrong apart from him, he replied: 'Since I’m probably 20 times  more . intelligent than most people I think that would be a very reasonable . assumption.’ His self-assessment does not match the description of him in court as 'a paedophile, a sexual abuser of children’. Suggesting that he would be appealing . the guilty verdict, Ovenden added: 'I am not backing down and under no . circumstances am I apologising for crimes that were never committed.’ The jury chose to believe the evidence that showed Ovenden was a . predatory child abuser who assaulted young girls in incidents dating . back between 25 and 40 years at his former home in Hounslow, West . London, as well as at his studio in Cornwall. On his way to court yesterday the artist said Judge Graham Cottle, who could have put him behind bars, was a 'poisonous man’. 'Fallen from grace': Ovenden, 70, was placed on the Sex Offender's register for five years by the judge . But as he left court Ovenden said: 'I . am quite gobsmacked and I have to thank Judge Cottle for his judgment . this time. With the language he used one anticipated getting banged up.’ He denied suggestions that his victims were traumatised by what he put them through as 'complete and utter b*******’. Judge Cottle had told Ovenden: 'You . would take the children to your studio to photograph them. They had no . understanding at that time what you were doing. Shamed: At the peak of his popularity, Ovenden's paintings sold for £25,000-a-time and were displayed at London¿s Victoria and Albert Museum and the Tate, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York . 'There can be no doubt that at that . time you had a sexual interest in children.’ But the judge then . justified his decision to suspend a 12-month prison sentence for two . years, saying the artist no longer posed a threat to children. Adding that guidelines allowed for a . jail term of up to five years, the judge told Plymouth Crown Court: 'I . take into account your age, the age of the offences, the considerable . self-inflicted punishment that comes with your convictions, your steep . fall from grace and your irreversibly tarnished  reputation.’ Peter . Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused . in Childhood, said: 'It’s an absolutely outrageous decision. 'The judiciary is sending out the message that this crime is not taken seriously.’ Ovenden, who lives on Bodmin Moor, . Cornwall, was convicted of six charges of indecency with a child and one . allegation of indecent assault, relating to three children.

He had one of the best jobs in Hollywood, picking up an estimated £250,000 an episode and a clutch of coveted TV awards along the way. But it seems that Hugh Laurie was every bit as hard to please as his fictional alter-ego, the grumpy Dr Gregory House. The British actor today sets out the full depth of the despair he felt while filming his hit TV series House. Laurie, 53, says he found his filming commitments so bleak that he hoped to have an accident on the way to the studio just to earn a few days rest. His starring role as Dr House made him one of the highest-paid TV actors of all time. The U.S. drama, which finally ended last year after eight series, also won him two Golden Globe awards and six Emmy nominations. But in an interview he says: ‘[It was] a gilded cage. At this distance it all sounds absurd. Ridiculous. After all, what was I doing other than playing about, telling stories with a very nice bunchof people? What could be constricting about that? ‘But the repetition of any routine, day after month after year, can turn into a bit of a nightmare.’ He adds: ‘I had some pretty bleak times, dark days when it seemed like there was no escape. And having a very Presbyterian work ethic, I was determined never to be late, not to miss a single day’s filming. ‘You wouldn’t catch me phoning in to say, “I think I may be coming down with the flu.” But there were times when I’d think, “If I were just to have an accident on the way to the studio and win a couple of days off to recover, how brilliant would that be?”’ At its peak, House was watched by more than 18million viewers in the US and was syndicated around the world, including to Channel 5. His starring role in House made Hugh Laurie one of the highest paid actors of all time . Laurie has two sons and a daughter with his wife, theatre administrator Jo Green, but spent nine months of every year apart from them while filming in Los Angeles. He has complained before that the relentless filming schedule made him morose and revealed the strains of being away from his family. The actor tells Radio Times that returning to the family home in north London had required adjustment. ‘[It was] difficult, yes, but probably more so for the family,’ he says. ‘For me it’s been a delight to be back with them.’","Hugh Laurie's starring role as Dr House made him one of the highest-paid TV actors of all time .

Microsoft is bringing back the Windows 'start' button following a massive consumer backlash, it has been revealed. The world's largest software company is . hoping to kickstart sales of its latest Windows version, which has not . made the splash with computer users it was hoping for. Many complained it was too complicated, and sales of iPads and tablets have also eaten significantly into Microsoft's profits as users move away from desktop computers. A leaked screenshot of the Windows 8.1 software posted on Paul Thurett's Windows Supersite reveals the return of the start button in the bottom left of the screen . Windows 8.1 also includes a vastly . improved 'search' function, which allows a user to search for documents, . apps, or items on the Internet from a single search bar. It . also allows users to see all their applications immediately in a grid . by swiping down or pressing a button on-screen. Users . can also customize the start screen much more easily, changing sizes of . app icon 'tiles' or controlling which apps appear. For the first time, it will be possible to open two windows simultaneously in the new-look interface. Windows . 8.1 includes Microsoft's latest browser, Internet Explorer 11, and lets . the user restore the address bar and tabs to the screen view. However, leaked screenshots of a new new version today revealed the button has returned. 'It’s back, baby,' said Paul Thurott, who posted the image to his blog. 'And if you are familiar with how Start 8 looks and works, this will look awfully familiar. 'Here, confirmed for the first time, is the Windows 8.1 Start button.' Executives say the plan is now to update Windows periodically, rather than waiting three years or so between big releases. Although Microsoft has sold more than 100 million Windows 8 licenses since October, broadly in line with Windows 7 three years ago, the company must tackle a dwindling PC user base and its inability to make a mark in the exploding tablet market. Shipments of traditional PCs - the most reliable gauge of Windows' popularity - are expected to fall almost 8 percent this year, while Microsoft's Surface has taken less than 2 percent of the tablet market. Windows 8 was designed to be used both on touch-screen tablets and traditional PCs. But while touch-screen users tend to like the new 'tile'-based interface, many mouse and keyboard users complained that the new design was confusing. Confirming speculation, Microsoft said the Windows 8.1 update will have a button in the bottom left corner of the screen that acts like the 'start' button in previous versions of Windows. Although it will not be labelled 'start', it features the Windows logo and takes the user straight to a grid of applications. 'The work you are seeing us do here is continuing to advance the modern (interface), while really taking into account some of the things we've learned from people who still want to use the desktop, to make the transition easier,' Antoine Leblond, corporate vice president of the Windows unit, said in an advance briefing on the Windows 8.1 update last week. The windows 8 start screen, which many users complained was confusing to use . Windows 8.1, previously known by the code name 'Blue', will be available for free to all Windows 8 users some time later this year. Microsoft will make a test version available at its annual developer conference on June 26. Windows 8.1 also includes a vastly improved 'search' function, which allows a user to search for documents, apps, or items on the Internet from a single search bar, like a souped-up version of Apple Inc's Spotlight feature. It also allows users to see all their applications immediately in a grid by swiping down or pressing a button on-screen, which should make it easy for unfamiliar users to get to the app they want quickly. Users can also customize the start screen much more easily, changing sizes of app icon 'tiles' or controlling which apps appear.

Windows 8.1 includes Microsoft's latest browser, Internet Explorer 11, and lets the user restore the address bar and tabs to the screen view. That feature was missing in the initial version of Windows 8, which was designed to make the most of limited screen space on a tablet but tended to disorient traditional mouse and keyboard users. Users will also no longer have to switch to the old desktop view to make changes in their default settings. But they will still have to switch back to a traditional desktop set-up to use some programs such as Word or Excel, which have not been redesigned to function in the new Windows 8 style.","Windows 8.1 set to be made available later this year .

Gamblers who prefer their laptops to blackjack tables could soon get a boost from Washington. Republican New York Congressman Peter King proposed federal regulations on Thursday that would rescue online gambling from the legal gray zone where it currently languishes. The federal government cracked down on online poker in 2011. But the same year, the U.S. Justice Department issued a ruling making online gambling legal so long as it's permitted on the state level. Look out Las Vegas: Morgan Stanley predicts that by 2020 online gambling in the U.S. will generate $9.3 billion . The federal government cracked down on online poker in 2011, but the same year a ruling was issued making it legal on a state level . Congress flirted with an online gambling bill last year, but industry infighting and partisan disagreement ultimately doomed it. When that legislation failed, states began moving ahead on their own. Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware have legalized some kind of online gambling, and legislatures in other states are weighing the issue. Morgan Stanley predicts that by 2020, online gambling in the U.S. will produce the same amount of revenue as Las Vegas and Atlantic City markets combined: $9.3 billion. But a larger, more fluid market is needed to drive up pots and create a robust stream of tax revenue. King says his measure, called the Internet Gambling Regulation, Consumer Protection and Enforcement Act of 2013, would help states and players to navigate the world of online betting with confidence. Congressman King claims the Internet Gambling Regulation, Consumer Protection and Enforcement Act of 2013, would help states and players to navigate the world of online betting with confidence . 'A common federal standard will ensure strong protections for consumers, protect against problem and underage gambling, and make it easier for businesses, players, lawmakers and regulators to navigate and freely participate,' he said in a statement. The bill would create an office of gambling oversight in the Treasury Department, impose uniform safeguards against underage and compulsive gambling, and facilitate interstate online wagering. Individual states could continue to ban the practice, or refuse to collaborate across their borders. The gambling lobby has been pushing for uniform federal legislation, warning that a patchwork of state laws will make it impossible for the global corporations that run the gambling industry to do business. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., pursued federal internet poker regulation last year but ultimately gave up before even introducing the legislation. Individual states could continue to ban gambling or refuse to collaborate across their borders . 'We spent the last four years working very, very hard to get in a position to support such legislation if it was introduced,' said American Gaming Association CEO Frank Fahrenkopf. 'So we're now left in a situation where Kyl, who was very important in the process, has retired, and you've got a multitude of states starting to pass legislation. So we think the urgency is even more important now.' The lobby, which historically supported an online poker only strategy, is expected to decide whether to change its stance and support the King bill at a meeting next month. This summer could see a relative flood of online gambling bills. Texas Republican Rep. Joe Barton plans to introduce online poker legislation by the end of next month, according to his spokesman Sean Brown. And Reid, who once called the passage of an online poker bill, 'the most important issue facing Nevada since Yucca Mountain,' continues to work on new legislation with Republican Nevada senator Dean Heller.","The federal government cracked down on online poker in 2011, the same year it was permitted on a state level .

A young man who lost his leg three years ago in an accident at a recycling plant has posted a recording of his 911 call online as part of his on-going commitment to helping other amputees adapt to living without a limb. John Maynard was 20 years old when his leg got cut off by a baler at the Taft Recycling Plant where he worked in Orlando, Florida. The harrowing 911 call features Maynard speaking to emergency services in the vital minutes after his leg had been ripped off. Listen to the call below . John Maynard was 20 years old when his leg got cut off by a baler at the Taft Recycling Plant where he worked in Orlando, Florida . In its entirety his call to the Orange County Sheriff's Office and the Orange County Fire Department lasts over 11 minutes and features him having to explain several times what has happened to him and where he is located. 'This is not a joke. I'm... gonna die. I'm gonna bleed to death I'm afraid. Please help me,' he tells the dispatcher. Later he asks the 911 operator to phone his mom. 'My mother is gonna... Ha Ha... I'm gonna die from this. My mother is gonna kill me,' he says, sounding quite delirious. Fearing he may be about to die he tells the dispatchers that he loves him and asks him to pray with him. Then he remembers his step-dad. 'I forgot about my dad. My, my step-dad he adopted me. Please tell him I love him.' Since learning to walk with a prosthetic he has been rock climbing and also got married . 'It's pretty gruesome in here. I'm not gonna lie to you,' he then confesses. Overall Maynard managed to stay remarkably calm during the ordeal considering he was alone and had just lost a limb. ‘I am very pleased with the job they did keeping me alert and responsive,’ writes Maynard, who has stayed in contact with all three of the people in the audio, including the responding officer who found him. The incident happened on July 9, 2010 when Maynard was working the night shift. When the baling machine jammed, he unclogging it but before he could get out it started up again and the compacting ram began moving towards him. Maynard managed to pull himself out of the way of the moving ram, by lifting his body up but unfortunately his right boot was not up far enough and the ram caught his boot. The incident occurred at the Taft Recycling Plant where Maynard worked in Orlando, Florida . ‘It [the bailer] pulled my leg closer and closer to the teeth, until it disappeared out of sight,’ writes Maynard about his experience. ‘Suddenly a splitting pain shot up my leg as I felt my foot get crushed all the way up to my shin. At this point, my leg became severed. I pulled myself up and out of the machine.’ It was at that stage that he called 911 and experienced what he describes as the ‘longest 16 minutes of my life’ as he fought to stay alive long enough for the emergency services to find him. In hospital later he had his leg amputated six inches below his knee and learned to walk with a prosthetic. Now he runs, rock climbs and does as much as he can to help others who have also lost limbs. The incident happened on July 9, 2010 when Maynard was working the night shift . He initially launched his YouTube channel – crew9t – as a coping mechanism, but says it has since grown to be a lot more. The channel is his way of interacting with and helping to guide new and recent amputees, as well as older amputees who still need help, and anybody who is interested in learning more about amputees and their our way of life. ‘My accident has changed my outlook toward the world, and I feel that my goals and even my way of thinking have changed too,’ writes Maynard who has also got married since the incident.

A Nigerian people smuggler who used witchcraft rituals to force children to work as sex slaves was jailed for 20 years yesterday. Osezua Osolase, 42, tricked poverty-stricken Nigerian orphans into travelling to the UK with the promise of a better life. But the young victims were raped, sexually abused and subjected to voodoo-style rituals by a child trafficking ring. Osolase, the linchpin of a multi-million pound global sex trafficking ring, used 'juju' magic to control his victims. He told the teenage girls they would die or never bear children if they tried to escape or revealed what had happened to them. Judge Adele Williams told Osolase: 'You are arrogant and manipulative, you are devoid of conscience, devoid of any compassion to your victims. 'You were dealing in exploitation and misery and degradation. You have been convicted on clear and compelling evidence of trafficking two girls in and out of the UK. 'Once they arrived in the UK the reality was explained to them that they were going to have to work as prostitutes. 'They were petrified that if they spoke out they would be harmed and killed.' During the trial it emerged that Osolase raped one of the young girls knowing he had HIV. Judge Williams described this as a 'seriously aggravating' feature to his crimes. At Canterbury Crown Court on Friday, Osolase was convicted of five counts of trafficking for sexual exploitation, one of rape and one of sexual activity with a child.

Sentencing: Judge Adele Williams told Osolase, a recycling worker from Beaumont Drive, Gravesend, Kent, that he was 'devoid of conscience, devoid of compassion to your victims' Osolase was convicted at Canterbury Crown Court of trafficking three girls aged 14, 16 and 17 . The charges relate to three girls aged . 14, 16, and 17. One was raped and all three endured juju rituals, . including one conducted by Osolase himself. One feared she was being taken to . another country to be used as a human sacrifice.

Chloe Madeley tweted this photograph of her doing sit-ups in the kitchen with her boyfriend Danny Young, a personal trainer . Cervical smear tests are crucial for the prevention of cervical cancer . Every year in the UK, over 3,000 women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer and nearly 1,000 women will die from the disease. Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women aged 35 and under. Cervical cancer is not thought to be hereditary. Cervical cancer, in 99.7 per cent of cases, is caused by persistent infection with a virus called human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a very common virus transmitted through skin to skin contact in the genital area. Around four out of five people (80 per cent) will be infected with HPV at some point in their lives. However, for the majority of women this will not result in cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is rare while HPV infection is common. Each year around five million women in the UK are invited for cervical screening (smear test). Cervical screening is not a test to find cancer, it is a screening test to detect abnormalities (pre-cancer) at an early stage in the cells in the cervix. Cervical screening is the process of taking a sample of cells from your cervix which are then examined to detect abnormalities that might develop into cancer in the future. The sample of cells is placed in liquid so that it can be analysed in the laboratory. This process is called liquid based cytology (LBC). Screening can detect precancerous/abnormal cells and the detection and successful treatment of these cells usually prevents the occurrence of cancer. Changes in these cells are generally caused by certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Testing for the HPV virus itself can also be done on the same LBC sample that is examined under the microscope, although at the moment this is not done routinely on all samples in the UK. Regular cervical screening provides a high degree of protection against developing cervical cancer and is offered free on the NHS. It is estimated that early detection and treatment through cervical screening can prevents up to 75% of cervical cancers from developing in the UK [2]. Not going for cervical screening is one of the biggest risk factors for developing cervical cancer.","Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan's daughter, 25, models for Sainsbury's .

"By . Claire Bates . UPDATED: . 23:59 EST, 12 December 2011 . The parents of a schoolboy who was struck down with narcolepsy after receiving a flu vaccine, said the Government should have carried out more tests before issuing the drug. Josh Hadfield, 6, lost muscle control and started sleeping for up to 19 hours every day just three weeks after getting the swine flu vaccine Pandemrix. He would fall asleep up to every five . minutes - even when he was walking, eating and swimming - and suffer . sudden bouts of cataplexy (loss of muscle tone) when he laughed. Josh, 6, at home during a narcolepsy attack with his mother Caroline. His school now has an area where he can nap . Now nearly two years later his mother Caroline, 41, said he was still suffering from the after effects of the controversial jab. 'I’m up with him around four times each night to feed him snacks and also comfort him because he has horrendous nightmares,' she said. 'He used to be sent home from school . every time he fell asleep but now they have set aside an area in his . classroom where he can take a nap.' He is being treated with Ritalin and anti-depressants but has never returned to the happy-go-lucky boy he once was. Earlier this year it emerged that the swine flu vaccine he received, called Pandemrix, has been linked to narcolepsy across Europe. Previous studies have recorded a 13-fold increase in cases among children who have received the jab and in July the European Medicines Authority advised against giving it to the under-20s. Wakeful: Caroline is up four times a night with Josh, which is when he now becomes hungry . Mrs Hadfield, a civil servant, believes the Government did not carry out sufficient tests before issuing it to millions of people. She said: 'Nothing could convince me it was anything but the jab which caused Josh’s conditions. 'The Government had a knee-jerk reaction to swine flu and put out this vaccine, giving it to very young children. 'Josh was absolutely fine straight after the jab. But three weeks later he began sleeping for up to 19 hours a day. 'He was halfway through his reception class at school and he would sleep as soon as I picked him up until the next morning. I had to bring a push chair to collect him. 'He slept more than he was awake. He would fall asleep in just a few seconds up to every five minutes. 'It was like he was a puppet whose strings had been cut, he just fell to the ground. 'Before the jab he was completely healthy. He was one of the most energetic boys that I have ever met. He was constantly on the go. 'His personality changed drastically as well. We had this happy, cheerful little boy who turned into someone who was aggressive and frustrated.' Pandemrix protects against the H1N1 virus, which caused by the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Only-child Josh received it at his local GP surgery on January 21 2010 after Caroline was told he was “at risk” of the virus as he was under five. Tests in the UK have not revealed a link between the jab and narcolepsy, but it has been confirmed in other countries, such as Finland and Sweden. In Finland, investigators found 79 vaccinated children and adolescents had developed narcolepsy, 12 times more than they would expect.  The Finnish government has accepted the link and promised compensation and support for affected families. Within three weeks of being given the jab, Josh began sleeping up to 19 hours a day and suffered from cataplexy episodes after extreme laughter or fear. He would “go ballistic” if mum Caroline or dad Charlie, 46, tried to wake him up - often throwing pushchairs or items of furniture at them. Caroline took him to the doctors and medics spent a year trying to diagnose him, giving him “test after test” including MRI scans, lumber punctures and brain scans. Josh was finally diagnosed with his conditions in January this year and has since been put on high doses of Ritalin, which he takes 45mg daily, and anti-depressants, which he takes twice a day. His condition has now slightly improved but he has had to make “massive” changes to his life. Collect photo of Josh after falling asleep in a supermarket trolley. His parents believe a swine flu vaccine is to blame . Caroline added: 'He is never hungry throughout the day because of his condition. Funnily enough, he doesn’t sleep much at night and that’s when he is hungry.' Caroline, who lives in Frome, Somerset, with husband Charlie, a printer, is now campaigning to raise awareness of the link. In July, the European Medicines Authority said studies showed a six to 13-fold increased risk of narcolepsy in children and adolescents vaccinated with Pandemrix, compared to those who had not been vaccinated. But it believed the vaccine “is likely to have interacted with genetic or environmental factors which might raise the risk of narcolepsy, and that other factors may have contributed to the results”. A spokeswoman for the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said the vaccine had already been banned from use in the under-20s. She said: ""The Finnish and Swedish studies were considered as part of the European safety review of Pandemrix earlier this year. 'The outcome of this review was that Pandemrix may only be used in persons aged under 20 years if the annual seasonal vaccine is not available and if there is a particular need to immunise against H1N1. 'No restrictions on use in adults were imposed, and the EU review acknowledged the important role that Pandemrix played in reducing the consequences of H1N1 in Europe during the pandemic. 'This risk is yet to be confirmed in other countries, and it is possible that other geographical factors in Sweden and Finland, at the time of the pandemic, contributed in some way to the cases of narcolepsy seen after vaccination with Pandemrix. 'Further work is on-going to explore this, including a study in the UK'. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said it could not comment on individual cases. She added: 'We would advise these families to seek independent advice.' The vaccine is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, who pointed out that only seven children had been reported to have developed narcolepsy out of six million doses given. Dr Pim Kon, UK medical director for the company, said: 'There is currently no evidence at all to suggest there is a causal link between Pandemrix and narcolepsy. 'We are working very hard with the regulatory authorities to try to understand what is happening. 'At the end of day, patient safety is of utmost importance to us and we wouldn’t ever put out a drug or leave it out there if we believed that it actually was a true issue.'","Our son 'was like he was a puppet whose strings had been cut'

Network Rail has been condemned for missing all of its punctuality targets across England and Wales – a finding that will come as little surprise to millions of regular train passengers. The rail infrastructure firm – whose top five directors were awarded annual bonuses totalling more than £350,000 – was blamed for 61 per cent of all trains running late over the past year. That rises to 70 per cent on the key West Coast mainline from London to Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool and Glasgow.. Failures by Network Rail caused trains to be delayed for millions of minutes . The rail infrastructure firm was responsible for the majority of delays on most lines, the damning new report showed . Of the 657,000 trains which ran late during the past 12 months, Network Rail was responsible for 401,000 of them, say watchdogs. Their damning report lists a catalogue of failures from punctuality to passenger disruption and concludes that Network Rail ‘must do better’. More than 70,500 long-distance services were either cancelled or ran more than ten minutes late – putting Network Rail on track for a £75million fine. And more than 361,000 train services in London and the South East were either cancelled or more than five minutes late last year, according to the report by the Office of Rail Regulation. Regional services also narrowly failed to meet their punctuality targets, with 91.1 per cent on time, compared to a target of 92 per cent. Failure: Network Rail has missed every punctuality target in England and Wales . The report comes amid anger that the top . five Network Rail directors will be awarded annual bonuses totalling . more than £350,000, with chief executive Sir David Higgins getting . almost £100,000 to go with his £577,000 annual salary. Anthony Smith, chief executive of independent watchdog Passenger Focus, . said: ‘Passengers will be disappointed to see that Network Rail is . failing to deliver on their top priority – performance.’ Bonus: Network Rail chief executive David Higgins is to receive £100,000 extra on top of a salary of £577,000 . Bob Crow, general secretary of the RMT transport union, added: ‘This is a ludicrous way to run our railways.’ Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle said: ‘It is not good enough that . commuters are facing so many delayed and cancelled trains, despite . inflation-busting fare rises and huge public investment in our railways. 'These latest figures make it all the more outrageous that Network Rail . bosses have received massive bonuses.’ Rail minister Norman Baker said: ‘Passengers expect their trains to arrive on time but unfortunately the industry’s performance over the past year has not been good enough. The industry needs to up its game.’ The watchdog also cites failures on the length of delays, freight punctuality, and Network Rail’s ability to manage its assets, including tracks and bridges. The report concludes bluntly: ‘Network Rail missed all of its targets for the punctuality of passenger services in England and Wales in 2012-13. ‘Levels of punctuality for passenger services in England and Wales remain below what Network Rail has been funded to achieve. The company has some catching up to do.’ The watchdog is also investigating ‘whether Network Rail did everything reasonably practicable to deliver punctuality targets for passenger services in the long-distance and London and South East sectors’. A Network Rail spokesman said: ‘The economic times in which we live mean that alongside delivering new capacity we need to keep a constant drive for improved efficiency.’ Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group has launched legal action against Network Rail for alleged breach of contract .","Damning report reveals catalogue of 'fails' and says firms 'must do better'

Bosses at the BBC were told three years ago that a doomed IT project – axed only after wasting £100million - was heading for trouble. It emerged yesterday that a whistle-blower warned managers in 2010 that the supposed £95.4million ‘benefit’ from the project was ‘hugely overoptimistic and difficult to deliver’. The Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was meant to allow BBC staff to access everything in the archive from their computers doing away with the need for video or audio tapes. Scrapped: Lord Hall, the new Director General, finally abandoned the Digital Media Initiative which intended to do away with the need for video or audio tapes . But the corporation announced that they were dropping the failed technology project nearly two weeks ago after frittering away almost £100 million of licence-fee payers money. Reports have also suggested it had delivered no savings at all to the corporation. The BBC’s chief finance officer Zarin Patel and a member of the BBC Trust Anthony Fry are to face the Public Accounts Committee on Monday, where they are expected to be grilled about the debacle. Earlier this week it was revealed that BBC chairman Lord Patten was warned a year ago about problems by former senior BBC manager, Bill Garrett, who was head of technology in the corporation’s programme-making department until 2010. He wrote to Lord Patten in May last year to warn him about ‘serious concerns’ over the cost of the DMI and that there was a risk that the National Audit Office – the government’s spending watchdog - may have been misled about the project. But further details of Mr Garrett’s correspondence with Lord Patten reveal he raised his concerns about the project to BBC management back in 2010. Warning: Lord Patten, the BBC Chairman, was told of 'serious concerns' over the cost of the project . In particular he questioned the financial projections the BBC was making to back the continuation of the project, after the corporation took over running of it after previous deal with technology company Siemens was brought to an end in 2009. When Mr Garrett looked at the figures, he told Patten in his letter, it had been ‘professionally difficult for me not to question the value proposition of the revised investment case. ‘I believed the stated benefits to be hugely overoptimistic and difficult to deliver, accordingly I made my concerns clear to BBC management.’ Lord Patten is said to have passed the concerns on to a colleague at the corporation’s governing body, who had responded by saying there were ‘no plans to carry out a further review’ of the project. However trustee Mr Fry did write to Public Accounts Committee chair Margaret Hodge last year to tell her he was ‘not content’ with progress on the project. There is growing concern that elements at the broadcaster had failed to make clear the scale of the trouble the project was in. Complaint: A trustee wrote to the Public Accounts Committee chair Margaret Hodge about trouble with the DMI . The BBC Trust is thought to be very interested in discovering why it was not told by executives earlier about the problems. The governing body was said to have been ‘shocked’ when it learned about the scale of the disaster, following a report last month. Hearing that Mr Garrett had raised the matter with bosses back in 2010 will no doubt be of interest to them. MPs have accused Lord Patten of ‘lurching from one crisis to another’ and being ‘asleep at the wheel’. Politicians branded the wasted money an ‘outrage’ when the corporation announced its closure about two weeks ago. It’s chief technology officer, John Linwood, has been suspended as a review is conducted into what went wrong. At the end of last month new director general Lord Hall finally abandoned the technological overhaul. He had admitted that the initiative ‘wasted a huge amount of licence-fee payers money.’ He said he had concerns about how the project had been run and a review had been ordered to find out what went wrong. Lord Patten was said to have personally replied to Mr Garrett earlier this week, apparently after the trust was informed the former BBC man had let MPs know about his letters. The BBC chairman is thought to have told him that his concerns, along with others, had led the Trust to ‘seek further information’ from the corporation’s management in the summer last year.","Whistleblower says BBC's costly IT project failure raised three years ago .

A letter written by novelist Rudyard Kipling, in which he appears to admit he plagiarised part of one of his best known works has been unearthed. The one-page autographed letter, written in 1895, addressed to an unknown woman, makes reference to the famous Laws of the Jungle, included in one of his most famous and well-loved novels, The Jungle Book. In the letter, Kipling admits it is 'extremely possible' he helped himself 'promiscuously' to others peoples' ideas, but that he cannot remember 'from whose stories I have stolen.' In his letter written in 1895 (left), author Rudyard Kipling (right) appears to admit it was 'extremely possible' he had plagiarised from other people . The letter is set to be sold for £2,500 at auction. The author, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907, was at one time believed to be the highest-paid writer in the world. His works include The Jungle Books, Kim and the Just So Stories. The letter makes reference to the famous Laws of the Jungle, included in Kipling's well-loved The Jungle Book . The letter, which is being sold by Andruiser Autographs, reads: 'I have been absent from home for some days. Hence the delay in answering yours of no date, in regard to my account of the Law of the Jungle. 'I am afraid that all that code in its outlines has been manufactured to meet ""the necessities of the case"": though a little of it is bodily taken from (Southern) Esquimaux rules for the division of spoils. 'In fact, it is extremely possible that I have helped myself promiscuously but at present cannot remember from whose stories I have stolen. 'Very sincerely, Rudyard Kipling.' Autograph expert Adam Andrusier said: 'Letters by Kipling that mention his most enduring work are extremely rare.' Born in Bombay, Rudyard Kipling was named after Rudyard Lake, Staffordshire, a beauty spot his parents visited. Kipling was the first English-language writer to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, at 42, and is still its youngest ever recipient. He died in 1936 and his ashes were buried at Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. The Jungle Book is one of the most loved children's books in the English language. In 2010, a rare proof edition of the classic was discovered that revealed the book was dedicated to his baby daughter Josephine in 1894 who was just one year old. She died just five years later of pneumonia. Rudyard Kipling won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907 and remains its youngest ever recipient . Joseph Rudyard Kipling was born in 1865 in Bombay to his British colonial parents, John and Alice Kipling. His father was an artist and worked at the Jeejeebhoy School Of Art in Bombay. When Kipling was six, his mother decided he needed an English education and sent him to live with a foster family, the Holloways, while he attended school in Southsea. Mrs Holloway beat and bullied him and he struggled to fit in at school, finding comfort only in books. At the age of 11, Kipling was on the verge of a nervous breakdown, so a family friend contacted his mother and she rushed over from India and removed him from the Holloways' clutches. After finishing his schooling in Devon, Kipling returned to India to work on a local newspaper. He also began to write short stories, and published a collection of them, entitled Plain Tales From The Hills, in 1888, just after his 22nd birthday. As Kipling's writing career burgeoned, he returned to England. His arrival in London was met with great acclaim, and he met and became friends with American agent and publisher Wolcott Balestier, at around the same time as he published The Light That Failed. Kipling fell in love with Balestier's sister Carrie, and married her in London in 1891.  The newlyweds moved to America and had a baby girl, Josephine, shortly after settling in Vermont in a house called Bliss Cottage. It was in this cottage that Kipling began work on what would become the Jungle Books - he had an idea about a boy who was brought up by wolves. In four years Kipling produced a series of Jungle Books, and a second daughter, Elsie, was born in 1896.  His tales of and for children won huge acclaim, and by the age of 32, Kipling was the highest-paid writer in the world. A legal scandal sent the Kiplings back . to England, and another child, a son, John, was born in 1897. But . tragedy struck when the Kiplings sailed back across the Atlantic to . visit Carrie's mother: Rudyard and his elder daughter became seriously . ill with pneumonia, and the child died.  It was said Kipling never got . over the tragedy. Batemans, a National Trust property in East Sussex, which was the home of Rudyard Kipling from 1902 to 1936 . The Kiplings returned to England and the picaresque novel Kim was serialised in a magazine and then published in book form in 1901. In 1902 Kipling bought Batemans, a house dating back to 1634.  Here, the author published his Just So Stories, which he had crafted for his late daughter as he put her to bed. In 1907 he won the Nobel Prize for Literature - the first English-language recipient - and in 1906 he published Puck Of Pook's Hill and Rewards And Fairies, which contained the poem If, came in 1910. In 1915 Kipling travelled to France to report on the First World War. In October of that year the family heard Kipling's son John had gone missing in France but no trace of him was found. Kipling felt so guilty about encouraging his son to sign up, he went to France to search for him but no trace was ever found. Kipling continued to write but, with two of his three children dead, he lost the will to write the children's stories that had made his name.","Letter, written in 1895, makes reference to famous Laws of the Jungle .

Wealthy property developer Michael Moore moved to Wargrave in Oxfordshire from his home in Surrey last year to spend more time on the water . A wealthy property developer drowned during a family day out on the river only yards from where his wife and daughters were enjoying rowing lessons. Michael Moore capsized in a kayak in a weir just 300 yards away from his family - including wife Sarah, whom he married just months ago. The 43-year-old was found floating face-down in the River Thames in Shiplake, South Oxfordshire, after he was dragged under the water for more than 10 minutes. The businessman had recently left his family's property firm in south London to set up a new company in the countryside and pursue his passion for kayaking before the tragedy happened. Mr Moore's devastated brother Tony, aged 45 years, said today: 'He loved the river, the surroundings and the people and the family wanted to get totally involved in it. 'We were a really tight family and everyone is in pieces. Michael was so young, fit and full of life. I would give everything to have him back.' Michael and his wife Sarah, aged 42 years, only tied the knot in February, said Tony. The couple and their two daughters - Imogen, aged 12 years, and Evie, aged 11 years - all ventured out onto the Thames last Saturday. Mr Moore had gone down the river in his kayak while his wife and children were having rowing lessons at Wargrave Boating Club. The father was last seen paddling past an island campsite towards the weir before he vanished. A while later, he was seen floating face-down in the water and was pulled out by two paramedics who were at the campsite on holiday. They performed CPR in an attempt to resuscitate him before he was rushed to Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, where he was pronounced dead. Mr Moore had just finished developing his first home since moving his young family from Sutton, Surrey, to a house in Wargrave, Oxfordshire, last year.

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 08:16 EST, 7 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:21 EST, 7 June 2013 . A council has been forced to pay a former school technician more than £100,000 after colleagues fashioned male genitalia from Blu-Tack and stuck them to her telephone. Male staff at Baldragon Academy in Dundee also scrawled pictures of penises on drawings devout Christian Margaret Malcolm, 56, had done for her Brownie pack during a 'shameful' campaign of sexual harassment. An employment tribunal in the city also heard that they used 'coarse industrial language' directly in front of Miss Malcolm, who they were aware was deeply religious, and that they regularly baited her. Devout: Christian Margaret Malcolm, 56, was subjected to harassment of an 'obscene and shameful nature' by male colleagues at Baldragon Academy in Dundee, a tribunal heard . The tribunal ruled that the behaviour of three of Miss Malcolm's male colleagues was 'of an obscene and shameful nature', after several episodes dating back from 2001 were recounted at the hearing. A judgement published yesterday found Miss Malcolm had been subjected to 'serious' sexual harassment over a period of several months. The tribunal ruled she should be awarded damages from Dundee City Council. The tribunal was told about another episode with a slogan to do with a Dundee Football Club player from 2001. The judgment published yesterday said a male colleague wrote on a noticeboard 'Caniggia is God' in a reference to the Argentinian footballer Claudio Caniggia, who signed for Dundee in 2000. When she saw it, Miss Malcolm changed 'God' to 'good' but the male colleague changed it back. According to the judgement, Miss Malcolm's colleagues 'decided to conduct a planned campaign of obscene behaviour against Miss Malcolm because they considered that she was a vulnerable individual who was very naive sexually and a devout Christian'/ . The judgement added: 'It was sexual harassment of a serious kind and went on for seven or eight months.' The tribunal ruled that Miss Malcolm should receive £25,000 from Dundee City Council for the injury to her feelings, and remarked that - although she had complained on several occasions to her superior - no satisfactory action was taken by the authority to ensure there was no repeat of the obscene behaviour by the three men. The council was also ordered to pay her £12,500 for psychiatric injury and £25,603 for loss of earnings. The sums amount to £63,103 and the tribunal ruled that she should also receive interest at 8 per cent from as far back as 2001 - plus a sum for loss of pension rights. This puts the total at more than £100,000. 'Long and complicated': Miss Malcolm left her position as a school technician at Baldragon Academy in 2002 . The council accepted that they owed compensation to Miss Malcolm for the unlawful and 'plainly shameful' conduct of their employees between May and December 2001. Miss Malcolm's case has a long history and was returned to the tribunal from the Court of Session in Edinburgh, where a judge said the time and expense involved in Margaret Malcolm's row with Dundee City Council was 'staggering'. The judge Lord Malcolm called for a deal to be reached and chronicled the 'long and complicated saga' which an employment appeals tribunal had described as 'a mess'. Miss Malcolm left her job early in 2002 and in April of that year she went to an employment tribunal alleging sexual harassment by fellow employees and blamed the local authority. After a legal row about whether she had waited too long before going to the tribunal, a series of hearings went ahead but in April 2003 her claims were dismissed. Although the tribunal accepted that the harassment had happened, they ruled that the council was not 'vicariously liable'. In March 2004 the decision was reversed after it was revealed that one of the tribunal members, ill at the time, had fallen asleep. A fresh tribunal heard the case again between March 2005 and November 2006, and there were further hearings in each of the next three years before the case arrived at Scotland's highest civil court. In sending the case back, Lord Malcolm expressed concern that the long and expensive saga had occurred in a system which was supposed to improve efficiency and cut costs. A spokesman for Dundee City Council said today: 'We are studying the details of the judgement thoroughly.'","Margaret Malcolm suffered 'serious' sexual harassment from male colleagues .

Two bungling robbers crashed a stolen tanker through a call centre's front door before using the vehicle to repeatedly ram a cash machine - before fleeing empty-handed. Now George Nicol, 37, and David Fowler, 27,  have been sent to prison after they targeted banking firm HSBC in Blantyre, Lanarkshire, in October last year. The High Court in Edinburgh heard that the pair stole the vehicle from a firm in East Kilbride, Lanarkshire, late on October 19 last year.

Now the pair have been jailed after their 'bizarre' botched robbery . The court heard heard how Nicol drove the truck a few hours later to HSBC. His side kick Fowler followed behind him in a Skoda Octavia which had false number plates and a sawn off shotgun and ammunition hidden in the boot. The court heard how once the pair arrived at the premises, Nicol used the industrial vehicle to smash his way through the glass door. In stunning footage that was played before Lord Glennie, people sitting in the court's public benches could see a glass door being smashed - and the frame being thrown several feet in the air. The giant vehicle can then be seen skidding along the floor in the call centre's reception before Nicol aims it at a cash machine and hits the ATM.

Nicol was caught on camera using the industrial vehicle to smash his way through the glass door . He then reverses before propelling the tanker again for a second time - when repeated attempts fail, the pair then take turns to hit the cash machine with a sledge hammer before leaving the scene empty handed. However, the court heard that the pair were arrested moments later after a high speed car chase through Lanarkshire. Police then found the sawn off shot gun and ammunition in their possession. The court also heard that HSBC had to spend £197,298 to repair the damage caused in the raid. The court heard that the owners of the sewage truck lost between £40,000 to £60,000 in business because of the theft of the sewage truck. It is estimated that it would cost £50,000 to replace the vehicle. Nicol and Fowler pleaded guilty last month to theft, robbery and firearms charges. Sentence had been deferred to Friday so that the court could obtain reports about their characters. On Friday, Lord Glennie sentenced Nicol to five and a half years in prison - Fowler received a five year sentence. The giant vehicle can be seen skidding along the floor in the call centre's reception before Nicol aims it at a cash machine and hits the ATM . The court heard that HSBC had to spend £197,298 to repair the damage caused in the raid . Passing sentence, Lord Glennie branded the botched robbery 'bizarre.' He added: 'You have both pleaded guilty to a bizarre attempt to rob money from a cash machine. 'The only saving grace in this case is that the crime was carried out in such an incompetent fashion. 'Offences of this nature require the imposition of significant periods of custody. You will both go to prison.' The pair can then be seen on the CCTV footage speeding away, before police chased them and caught them. Today Nicol's defence advocate Paul Nelson told the court that his client - who had owned a garage in Glasgow - had turned to crime because he had financial problems. Mr Nelson added: 'The video footage shows the inept nature of the crime. It is a demonstrable fact that the person who committed the crime is monumentally stupid or desperate. The pair pleaded guilty last month to theft, robbery and firearms charges. The judge said the crime was carried out 'in such an incompetent fashion' 'He is not stupid my lord. He was quite desperate. Prior to the crime he owned a garage business. He employed several people and made charitable donations.' Mr Nelson said that Nicol's garage ran into financial problems because he sold partly worn tyres. In 2011, Glasgow City Council changed local laws with regard to businesses who sold partly worn tyres. Mr Nelson said that Nicol didn't comply with the law changes and that police raided his premises. Mr Nelson added: 'The police came to his premises and seized £20,000 of stock. This placed him on a slippery slope. What happened with regard to his firm led him into entering into this enterprise.' Fowler's solicitor advocate John Keenan told the court that his client also had financial difficulties at the time of the robbery. He added: 'He had lost his job. At the time of the offence, he had learned his partner was pregnant and his was very worried about his ability to provide for their future. 'He fully appreciates that he is facing a lengthy custodial term. This has been brought into sharp focus by the fact that his partner is due to give birth in the next week and he won't be there to see the birth of his child or participate in its formative years. 'I would ask your lordship to take his guilty pleas into account and restrict his sentence.' Lord Glennie said the only sentence available to him was to impose custodial terms.","George Nicol, 37, and David Fowler, 27, drove the sewage truck through the glass doors of the offices of banking firm HSBC in Blantyre, Lanarkshire .

'Evil killer': Aaron Mann (left), 33, strangled his girlfriend Claire O'Connor (right), 38, to death after a New Year's Eve party then tried to hide her body . The 38-year-old's body was found wrapped in a sleeping bag in the boot of her car on January 2 last year. Mann told a court ‘voices in his head’ told him to kill his lover, and denied murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. But he was sentenced to life in prison today, after being found guilty of murder yesterday following a week-long trial. Warwick Crown Court heard how he had previously sent his girlfriend chilling death threats; one which read 'You aint going to be around for long', and another that said simply 'I will kill you'. Mann was told he must service a minimum of 16 years in court today. Domestic violence: The body of the mother-of-four was discovered wrapped in a sleeping bag in the boot of her Ford Focus on January 2 last year . His victim's heartbroken parents Graham and Patricia Griffiths said after the sentencing they had been in 'no doubt' that Mann was guilty of the 'savage and brutal murder of our daughter'. 'We would like to thank the jury, who have seen through the lies and deceit of Aaron Mann in his attempt to minimise his responsibility for the brutal murder of our daughter Claire,' the couple said in a statement issued through Warwickshire Police. 'His suggestion that “voices told him to do it”, were in our opinion completely fabricated. 'Claire had decided to split up from Mann, but she was murdered before she had a chance to leave him. 'We . have had to live with the terrible consequence of Mann’s murder of our . daughter, the details of which have been both shocking and graphic. 'At . no stage has Mann shown any remorse whatsoever and his account of how . he murdered Claire is quite the worst thing any parent could possibly . imagine.

'Difficult': Bouncer Mann was convicted of murder and told he must serve at least 16 years in prison following a week-long trial . Detective Chief Inspector James Essex, from Warwickshire Police, said the force was pleased with the outcome of the trial. 'This has been a particularly difficult trial for Claire’s family and friends,' he said. 'Unfortunately domestic abuse is largely a hidden crime that all too often takes place behind closed doors. Often no one other than those directly involved, know it is taking place. 'Sadly it is too late for Claire, but I am urging anyone who suffers from domestic abuse, in whatever form, be it physical, psychological, sexual, financial or emotional, to seek help from the police or other support agencies. 'The message to anyone affected by domestic abuse is that you do not have to put up with the abuse and you don’t have to cope on your own. 'There are people who can help, people who can listen and who can provide you with support.' The court heard throughout the trial how Mann was driven to jealousy after seeing Ms O'Connor socialising with other people, and she had told him their relationship was over. Mark Wall QC, prosecuting, said the attack occurred on January 1 after the pair returned from a pub called the Green Bear, near their home in Nuneaton. Mr Wall said: 'They returned home at around 12.30am and Mann killed Claire by applying such force to her neck as to asphyxiate her. 'A pathologist found other injuries as a result of the attack, including a broken jaw and two broken ribs. 'There can be no doubt that what Mann did was a significant attack, which was intended to either kill her or cause her very serious injury.' Mr Wall added that the pair’s relationship 'had not run smooth' and that the previous spring Ms O'Connor had gone to the police to report violence and threats against her by Mann. Giving evidence to the court himself, Mann - who had already admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility - demonstrated how he had gripped her neck and put a pillow over her face. He added: 'The voices told me to finish her off'. Prosecution psychiatrists dismissed Mann’s claims he had an acute psychotic illness - finding he had been perfectly 'rational' and careful in trying to cover his tracks. Mann's medical records - which included frequent visits to doctors and psychiatrists since 2009 - had made no mention of hearing voices.","Aaron Mann, 33, broke Claire O'Connor's jaw and two of her ribs .

"By . Nick Mcdermott, Science Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 05:07 EST, 7 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:34 EST, 7 June 2013 . The world of a Jane Austen novel was a dangerous place for a single, young woman. Not only must they fight it out for the best husband, but they are forever falling victim to a fever - usually as the result of something as simple as wet stockings or being caught in the rain. But now medical historians have claimed that Jane Austen's hypochondriac characters did, in fact, have plenty to fear. With deadly airborne diseases such as . tuberculosis much more widespread in the 19th century, being wet could . actually have made them much vulnerable to illness. Sensitive: An emotional Marianne Dashwood (Charity Wakefield) falls into a 'putrid fever' after walking through wet grass in twilight in Sense and Sensibility . Science broadcaster Vivienne Parry, who is presenting a talk on Pride, Prejudice and the Doctor at the Cheltenham Science Festival today, said: ‘We may laugh at Jane Austen and her heroines susceptibility to dampness. ‘But the reality is we still cling this idea that going out without shoes or going to bed with wet hair means we could catch our death of cold. ‘At the time no-one treated the cause, but the symptoms. ‘And death rates from infectious diseases such as TB were very high, while four of Jane’s sister-in-laws died in childbirth. ‘So women had every reason to be cautious.’ Professor John Oxford, Britain’s leading flu expert, said that in Austen’s time, it was possible that a good soaking could leave a person more vulnerable to the biological infections rife during the period. He said: ‘I don’t think it’s possible to catch a virus from getting wet and cold. ‘What really happens in winter time is that we all stay indoors and huddle closer together making it easier for infections to spread. It has nothing to do with wet hair or unslippered feet. ‘But in Jane Austen’s time there were a . lot of horrible bacteria around like TB, and if your whole body got wet . you could become more vulnerable to these illnesses, so there may be . some basis in it.’ Victims: In Pride and Prejudice, eldest daughter Jane Bennet (left, played by Morven Christie) falls sick after being caught in the rain and is bedridden for days. Right, hypochondriac Mr Woodhouse in the novel Emma . Worried: Other characters in Austen's novels were famous hypochondriacs, including Mrs Bennet asking for 'compassion for my poor nerves' Modern medicine has dismissed the idea that a slight drenching could result in a life-threatening condition. But in fact, bizarre as it may sound, the malaises afflicting Austen’s leading ladies may not be as outlandish as they first seem. With medical knowledge slowly advancing in the late 18th century, events that ‘excited’ the system were being linked with the onset of illness by the educated classes began. Walking through the wet grass at twilight leads Marianne Dashwood to rapidly fall into a ‘putrid fever’ in Sense and Sensibility, while Pride and Prejudice’s Jane Bennet falls swiftly ill after being caught in the rain on horseback. Danger: Jane Austen's characters frequently fell ill after being exposed to the elements in 19th century Britain . Other characters in her novels were famous hypochondriacs, with Mrs Bennet asking for ‘compassion for my poor nerves’, while in Emma her father Mr Woodhouse refused to eat cake on the orders of his apothecary. Professor Michael Worboys from Manchester University said the concept of nerves was also introduced in the 18th century, with ‘nervousness becoming a disease of the English, particularly the English aristocracy’. ‘They talked about nerves in terms of fibres. They had this dual function of communicating and motor function,’ he said. ‘One of key ideas was fibres that somehow vibrated and people were highly strung. People talked about the tone of their nerves.’ As a result, in Georgian England, greater medical understanding resulted in hypochondria becoming fashionable, as the middle-class affected illness to emulate the cautions of the aristocracy.","Medical historians say hypochondriac characters had plenty to fear .

A bungling cat burglar fleeing the scene of a break-in was caught on camera falling head first out of an upstairs window. Stuart Marsden, 48, had shimmied up a drainpipe to clamber through a sash window in the hope of grabbing valuables from a pensioner's upstairs bedroom. But he was forced to flee empty handed when he was disturbed by a relative of the 85-year old householder who had family over for tea. Watch the CCTV below . Bungled getaway: Stuart Marsden is seen dangling out of the upstairs window moments before he fell to the floor headfirst in Blackburn. He is hanging out the window for some time before he fell to the floor . Hopeless burglar: Marsden hangs out of the window for several seconds before eventually plunging to the floor . Drop: Marsden is caught on CCTV falling into the sloping roof before plunging further down onto the floor . Bungling burglar: Stuart Marsden, 48, fell out the window during the burglary in Blackburn . As he tried to make his escape after being disturbed, Marsden slipped as he was grabbed by the legs and fell 15feet - landing on his head as he tumbled from the terraced property. He was caught on CCTV footage falling to the ground before he got to his feet and limped away from the scene. Despite making his getaway, he was arrested after police recovered DNA from a woolly hat he dropped at the scene. Amazingly it was the second time Marsden had survived a fall during a bungled cat burglary. In 2010 he suffered a fractured pelvis, ankle and wrist when he jumped from the first floor window of the home of another pensioner. Today Lancashire Police issued CCTV of . the raid after career criminal Marsden, from Blackburn, was jailed for . 28 months. He pleaded guilty to burglary with intent to steal. Preston . Crown Court was told the raid occurred in March after Marsden walked . past the victim's house in Blackburn and noticed an upstairs window was . open. Assuming the property . was empty, he clambered up the drainpipe unaware 85-year-old Jean West . was in the lounge downstairs with her daughter, son-in-law and grandson. Son-in-law . Neil Morrison, 38, from Edinburgh, heard Marsden climbing up the . drainpipe and went outside to investigate - only to see the intruder's . legs disappearing through the upstairs window. Mr Morrison then ran upstairs and made a grab for Marsden and a struggle broke out out. He tried to stop the intruder climbing back out of the window only to be kicked repeatedly in the face. But as Marsden broke free he slipped and fell head first onto a porch roof, before landing on the ground below. He was arrested the following month. He claimed he had carried out the burglary in a bid to get money to pay for a deposit on a flat, and to pay for flights to Spain so he could look for work. At Preston Crown Court Marsden, who has 67 previous convictions including 12 for burglary, asked for two similar offences to be taken into consideration. Passing sentence Judge Michael Byrne told him: 'Your recording of offending is appalling.' Fall: Marsden topples off the sloping roof and onto the floor. In total he fell around 15ft . Getaway: Marsden is seen limping away down the street. Although police didn't catch him immediately, he left his hat at the scene and was caught by his DNA . After the case, Mrs West, a widow who has five children and eight grandchildren, said: 'I am just really surprised he survived that fall going out of that window head first like that. It is a real drop but he got what he deserved preying on an old lady like that. 'I'm just glad I had family round at the time because if I had been on my own I think the shock of him being in the house would have killed me. 'We heard a noise. My son-in-law went to check it out and came running back inside saying he had seen a man climbing into my bedroom window. 'Neil ran upstairs and switched on the light as the man dived onto the floor to try and hide between the wardrobe and the bed.' Flee: Marsden thought the property was empty - and didn't realise the 85-year-old woman was in with her family at the time . She added: 'This is the second time I have been burgled. The first time was about two years ago when a man sneaked into my house at tea time and hid under the stairs for hours. 'When I went to bed around midnight it just felt like something was wrong, so I kept getting up. Around 3am the man popped out from under my bed, apologised and ran off. 'That was horrific, especially thinking about what could have happened. To be targeted again is horrible.' Detective Inspector Paul Langley, from Lancashire Police said: 'This CCTV footage shows the lengths opportunist thieves will go to. If they see an open window or door, they will take their chances and, in Marsden's case, risk life and limb to get into your home. 'I hope people are reassured that Marsden is now off the streets and behind bars for a considerable amount of time. 'At the same time, I hope this acts as a warning to residents to make sure they lock their doors and windows before they go out and before they go to bed.' In the previous burglary in Bolton, Greater Manchester in August 2010, Marsden was disturbed by a neighbour of his 76-year old victim after he clambered up a drainpipe to steal her handbag. He assumed the house was empty and leapt out of a landing window to escape only to be seriously injured in the fall. He later appeared in court on crutches after undergoing surgery and was jailed for 16 months.","Stuart Marsden, 48, fell while trying to jump out of an upstairs window .

A London council has been been accused of 'cultural vandalism' over plans to sell off £13million of its giant collection of Ming and other Chinese dynasty antiques. At least 24 of Croydon's Council's most expensive items, including tomb models and china dating back to the ninth century, could now be auctioned. The borough says it cannot display much of its 230-piece collection - bequeathed by local businessman and collector Raymond Riesco in 1964 - because they cannot afford 'Louvre-style security'. Historic: This stoneware narcissus bowl from the 14th century is among the items likely to be sold by Croydon Council, who hope it'll raise £13million in a move being called 'cultural vandalism' Delicate: This perfectly preserved porcelain cake box from the Wanli period in China, made between 1573 and 1619, will also probably go to auction . Some of the collection, which spans from Neolithic times to the 19th century, has featured at other galleries and museums, including the British Museum. Magical: This antique, a porcelain pilgrim bottle from the Xuande Period (1426 to 35), is also likely to be up for grabs for a small fortune . The items proposed for sale have been moved to a central London location for valuation. The council said the sell-off had the backing of the Riesco family as long as the proceeds were spent on culture in the borough. It plans to use the proceeds to help fund the refurbishment of Fairfield Halls, the 1962 concert hall in Croydon. But the plans have angered some local historians and residents, with a petition calling on council leader councillor Mike Fisher to stop the sale reaching nearly 200 signatures in five days. Oliver Lewis, who started the petition, said the sale would be 'cultural vandalism', adding: 'These pieces are a real asset to the borough and should be cherished for the benefit of all. 'Selling them off to chase a quick buck is short sighted.' Sean Creighton, a local historian and archivist, said the threatened collection could have educational value as well as attracting visitors. He added: 'The collection may not seem part of our heritage but it is, because Ming porcelain was very popular in 18th century Britain and Europe and English potters were inspired by it, launching our own fine china industry.' A rival petition supporting the sale currently boasts 86 signatures. It was launched on Wednesday. Valuable: This fine porcelain saucer from the Jiajing period, 1522 to 1566, is one of 24 items likely to go under the hammer . Well known: Some of Croydon's collection has been at the British Museum (pictured) but the council say they cannot afford the 'Louvre-style security' they need for it . Councillor Tim Pollard, the council's culture spokesman, said the items proposed for sale - which he claimed had never been exhibited in Croydon - were wasted as it could not afford to insure them for display. He said: 'Individually they are all very valuable items, very small and very portable, so to a professional gang a very tempting target. 'In order to put the items we are talking about on display we would have to add Louvre-style security to the Riesco gallery - things like laser alarms - and that would cost hundreds of thousands of pounds.' He added: 'What is the point of keeping some very valuable items in a crate in a vault? Isn't it better to use the money you've got tied up in that for something we can all access?' The sale will be considered by the council's corporate services committee on July 24.","Croydon Council plans to sell off at least 24 items dating back to 9th century .

Texas authorities today confirmed that a three-year-old boy adopted from Russia was covered in bruises and unresponsive when he was brought into hospital last month, where he was later pronounced dead. The news comes a day after Russia's Investigative Committee accused Little Max Shatto's adopted American mother of causing his tragic Jan. 21 death after she allegedly abused him and gave him psychiatric drugs. An autopsy into Max's cause of death is . pending but Ector County Medical Examiner's office today gave weight to the Kremlin's claims after it confirmed marks on the child's body that could have been caused by abuse. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Inhuman treatment': Russian authorities are also saying Maxim was given psychiatric medication and are demanding to play a part in the investigation . Accused: Laura Shatto, right, is accused of beating little Max, right, to death last month . Chief investigator Shirley Standefer said there were signs of bruising on Max's body, including in the lower abdominal area. However, she refused to comment on whether the bruises appeared to be intentional or accidental. The State Department has meanwhile cautioned people not to jump to conclusions about the boy's cause of death and to instead wait until the investigation and autopsy have delivered their results. Max's tragic death has received international attention in the wake of a recent Russian ban on all American adoptions. Russia's Investigative Committee said that it had opened an . investigation into the little boy's death. 'Three-year-old Maxim was beaten, . according to the investigators, by his adoptive mother, who fed him . psychoactive drugs over a long period of time, saying that he had some . psychiatric illness,' said Pavel Astakhov, the Russian Children's Rights . Commissioner alleges, according to The Telegraph. Tragedy: Max Shatto, 3, died last month after being adopted by a family in Texas. Russian authorities are claiming he was abused . Russian born: Maxim was born the town of Pskov, near Russia's western border with Estonia. The boy lived with a family in Gardendale, Texas with his family before his death . He said the toddler had numerous bruises on his body and damage to organs. 'Our consuls must be allowed to see the materials of the case and take part in the formulation of the prosecution,' he added. Texas Child Protective Services spokesman Patrick Crimmins confirmed . the agency had received a report on Jan. 21 of the death of a three-year-old . named Max Shatto, and that the Ector County Sheriff's Office in West . Texas was investigating. Crimmins said CPS had received allegations of physical abuse and . neglect, but had not determined whether those allegations were true. Parents: The boy's adopted parents, Alan and Laura Shatto, denied knowing about the allegations being made by Russian authorities. No arrests have been made . Sad: The little boy, pictured right, was pronounced dead in hospital on Jan. 21 . Sgt. Gary Duesler, spokesman for the Ector County Sheriff's Office, said . no arrests have been made and authorities are waiting for autopsy . results. An obituary for Max Shatto published Jan. 26 by the Midland . Reporter-Telegram says he was born on Jan. 9, 2010, in the town of . Pskov, near Russia's western border with Estonia. The boy lived with a . family in Gardendale, about 350 miles west of Dallas, before his death . on Jan. 21, according to the obituary. When reached by telephone, Mr Shatto told the Telegraph: 'We're not aware of what any Russian envoy has said. We're not making any comment.' On the funeral home's website, . Max's parents wrote: 'Max, you were not with us long enough to leave . fingerprints on the walls but you left fingerprints upon our hearts. Accusations: Pavel Astakho has alleged that Maxim was beaten to death by his American mother. American authorities have not confirmed the allegations are still investigating . 'When we get to Heaven, we know we will hear your sweet voice singing with the angels. We love you and will always miss you.' The death comes weeks after Russia announced it was banning all American . adoptions in retaliation for a new U.S. law targeting alleged Russian . human-rights violators. The ban also reflects lingering resentment over . the 60,000 Russian children adopted by Americans in the past two . decades, of which at least 19 have died. Russian Foreign Ministry official Konstantin Dolgov said in a statement that the boy's death was 'yet another case of inhuman treatment of a Russian child adopted by American parents.' Duesler said he could not immediately confirm or deny Russian allegations of abuse. Dolgov also accused the U.S. Department of State of not helping Russian consular officials investigate the death. Look of love: Alan Shatto embraces his son, Maxim, in this photo. Max's parents wrote in his obituary, 'When we get to Heaven, we know we will hear your sweet voice singing with the angels. We love you and will always miss you' Timing: Max's death comes weeks after Russian authorities announced it was banning all adoptions by Americans . A State Department official said the government is aware of the case and 'takes very seriously the welfare of children, particularly children who have been adopted from other countries.' 'We will continue to assist the Russian Embassy and consulate officials in making contact with the appropriate authorities in Texas,' said the State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak on the record about the matter.

A former airline pilot accused of murdering his wife by deliberately crashing his car into a tree faked unconsciousness when emergency services tried to assist him, a court has heard. Iain Lawrence, 53, is accused of murdering his estranged wife Sally Lawrence, 47, because he had not come terms with the break up of their marriage. Prosecutors allege Mrs Lawrence's seatbelt was unclipped before the crash and her airbag had been disabled. A court sketch shows Iain Lawrence in the dock at Leicester Crown Court where he is on trial accused of murdering his wife Sally, right, by deliberately crashing his car into a tree with her in the passenger seat . Gartree Road near Leicester, where Mrs Lawrrence died. The court heard the passenger's side airbag had been turned off . Today Peter Hawkin, a retired . firefighter, told the jury at Leicester Crown Court that Lawrence had . his eyes shut in the driver's seat 'like a child' when he stopped at the . scene to help. Describing Lawrence, Hawkin told the . court: 'It was as if a child was squeezing his eyes shut pretending to . be asleep. He was squeezing but the eye was twitching.' Nirmal Shant QC, prosecuting, asked him: 'Was he unconscious?' 'No,' Mr Hawkin replied. 'Was that the impression that was being given that he was unconscious?' Miss Shant continued. 'I believe so in my opinion,' Mr Hawkin answered. In police interviews after the crash, . Lawrence claimed to have no memory of what had happened or of getting . into his red Peugeot car at the start of the journey, the court has . heard. Mr Hawkin told the court he assessed Mrs Lawrence and believed her to be seriously injured. 'I did suspect (she was dead) because . of the pallor and having experience, looking at the scene, looking at . the individual I knew it wasn't good.' He added: 'By looking at her, I knew it was too late.' Lawrence is alleged to have adopted . the brace position while his wife, who was not wearing a seatbelt, died . almost instantly in the crash on Gartree Road, in Oadby, Leicestershire . at around 6.30pm on October 6 last year, the prosecution claims. The Lawrences' £300,000 family home in Oadby, which the couple still shared. The court heard they had an 'acrimonious' discussion about the division of their assets the day before the crash . Today the court heard from a collision . expert who said his examination of the road and tyre marks showed . Lawrence's car had travelled straight towards the tree. Police constable Timothy O' Donnell, a . forensic collision investigator from Leicestershire Police, said: 'The . Peugeot began to negotiate the left hand bend. It has to have made a right turn (to generate the tyre marks). 'But the marks are two straight lines that is telling me that there is no longer right hand drive applied. 'It's a straight path. Straight towards the tree,' he concluded. He also said he could find no evidence of tyre grinding and no feathering to the tyres to suggest emergency braking. The officer said friction marks on the . seatbelts suggested Lawrence had been wearing his at the time of the . impact but that his wife's was either not plugged in correctly or that . she was not wearing it. Moving on to the airbags, Mr O'Donnell . told the jury the driver's airbag had deployed successfully while the . passenger's had not. On examination of the vehicle, the officer could find no fault with the airbag system, he told the court. He said the gear lever of the car was in fifth gear when he examined it and the speedometer stuck at 54mph. Mr Lawrence's Peugeot 406, pictured before the collision. There was no evidence he had attempted an emergency stop, the court heard . Mr O'Donnell also told the court that . visibility would have been good at the time of the incident and that the . road surface had been dry. Lawrence, who was not seriously injured in the crash, denies a single count of murder. The jury has heard Mrs Lawrence, who . had instigated divorce proceedings, had told friends she feared her 'calm and cold' husband would try to kill her. She died a day after 'locking horns' with her husband over how to divide up their assets - and just two days . before the first stage of the divorce was due to be granted. Mr Lawrence was still living with his . wife at their matrimonial home in Ring Road, Leicester, at the time of . the crash, although they were leading separate lives.

A south-east Missouri man accused of killing his estranged wife, the mother of his then-five-year-old triplets, has pleaded guilty to murder. James Clay Waller II, 42, was given a 20-year . prison sentence on Thursday after pleading guilty to second-degree murder . and admitting inside a packed Cape Girardeau . County courthouse that he  choked his wife Jacque Waller, 39, to death before burying her . body on a nearby island in the Mississippi River nearly two years ago. Prosecutors originally charged Clay Waller with first-degree murder last year, despite the fact that Jacque Waller's body hadn't been found. His guilty plea to the lesser charge was conditional on his leading detectives to his wife's body. Abuse: Jacque Waller's husband murdered her after a meeting with divorce lawyers more than two years ago . Left behind: Jacque Waller's seven-year-old triplets are being adopted by her sister, Cheryl Brenneke . Neither Jacque Waller's sister Cheryl Brenneke nor Circuit Judge Benjamin . Lewis were happy with the lighter sentence, but were left . with few options, since Waller was the only person who could lead . authorities to Jacque Waller's body. Guilty: James Clay Waller II leaves the courtroom after pleading guilty to second-degree murder for the death of his wife, Jacque Sue Waller at the Cape Girardeau County Courthouse in Jackson, Missouri . Authorities finally found 39-year-old Jacque . Waller's body on May 29 in Alexander County, after she had been missing . since 2011. The plea deal ensured a conviction for Clay Waller and offered grieving . family members closure in the case. 'I did not want this deal,' said Brenneke, who has custody of her sister's now-seven-year-old triplets and plans to adopt the two girls and one boy. 'My mother and father and these children deserved to bury her, though.' Judge Benjamin Lewis acknowledged that 'there will . be a number of people critical of this plea agreement. However none of . those critics could provide the body of Jacque Waller.' 'That . is not what you deserve, but it will have to do,' he said in handing . down the 20-year sentence to Clay Waller. Under the original charge of . first-degree murder, Waller could have faced the death penalty or life . in prison without parole. 'It was decided that it was more important to get Jacque back,' said County prosecutor Chris Limbaugh. Clay Waller is already serving a . five-year term in federal prison for threatening Brenneke over the . Internet. His sentence in the murder case will run concurrent with the . federal case, officials said. Jacque Waller went missing on June 1, . 2011, the same day she and her husband met with a divorce lawyer and . argued over money. The had been living in separate houses for three . months prior to the meeting. The . Honda Pilot belonging to Jacque Waller was found along Interstate 55 . with its tires slashed the day after she disappeared. It had been seen . the day before at Clay Waller's home. Several searches since then turned . up sporadic leads, including the discovery of her purse near where the . car was found. Memories: In a statement on their Facebook page Waller's family confirmed 'with a heavy heart' that Jacque Waller's remains were found . The FBI . said last year that Clay Waller suggested to his father that he had . broken Jacque Waller's neck and buried her in a hole that he had dug in . advance. But Clay Waller made no confessions to police, and his father . died before he could testify against his son. During . the hearing, Clay Waller heard a taped statement from his . own seven-year-old son in which the boy disowned him. 'I never want . to see you again for my entire life,' said the boy, calling his father a . 'big, fat jerk.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 22:21 EST, 27 November 2011 . After challenging the President to a series of live debates, GOP frontrunner Newt Gingrich has said that President Obama can use a teleprompter if he wants to. The Republican hopeful made the gibe at a speech in Naples, Florida. He said: 'If he wants to use a teleprompter, then it would be fine with me.' Following cheers and laughter, he added: 'It has to be fair. If you [were] to defend ObamaCare, wouldn't you want a teleprompter?' My turn: Newt Gingrich got a coveted endorsement from New Hampshire's largest paper . In challenging the President to a series of seven live unmoderated debates the GOP contender is taking a bold stance but his confidence may be misplaced. While Obama is an exceptional orator, Gingrich has comfortably held his own in the debates. But with his Republican competitors concentrating on attacking Obama rather than each other, he has not yet come any real pressure. Gingrich appears to have an unlikely admirer in one-time adversary Bill Clinton. Explaining Gingrich's recent popularity the former president told News Max: 'I think he’s doing well just because he’s thinking, and people are hungry for ideas that make some sense. He's being rewarded for thinking.' Clinton refused to predict a GOP winner but praised Gingrich's performance in the debates. 'I still think Romney comes across as strong and forceful and knowledgeable and I thought Perry had a better debate last night, he did much better than he's doing,' he said. In his new book 'Back to Work' Clinton called Gingrich 'creative, flexible, and brimming over with new ideas' and, in September, prophesised that the Republican would make a comeback. New Hampshire's largest newspaper today endorsed former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in the 2012 GOP presidential race, signalling that rival Mitt Romney isn't the universal favourite and potentially resetting the contest before the state's lead-off primary January 10. 'We are in critical need of the innovative, forward-looking strategy and positive leadership that Gingrich has shown he is capable of providing,' The New Hampshire Union Leader said in its front-page editorial, which was as much a promotion of Mr Gingrich as a discreet rebuke of Mr Romney. 'We don't back candidates based on popularity polls or big-shot backers. We look for conservatives of courage and conviction who are independent-minded, grounded in their core beliefs about this nation and its people, and best equipped for the job,' the editorial said. Mr Romney enjoys solid leads in New Hampshire polls and remains at the front of the pack nationally. A poll released last week showed him with 42 per cent support among likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire. Mr Gingrich followed with 15 per cent in the WMUR-University of New Hampshire Granite State poll. Rep Ron Paul of Texas posted 12 per cent support and former Utah Gov. John Huntsman found 8 per cent support in that survey. Those . numbers could shift based on the backing of The Union Leader, a . newspaper with a conservative editorial stance that proudly works to . influence elections, from school boards to the White House, in the . politically savvy state. No longer the favourite: The New Hampshire paper's endorsement potentially resets the contest before the state's lead-off primary . Front and centre: The editorial endorsing Mr Gingrich was featured on the front page of the Union Leader . The front page one editorial, signed by . publisher Joseph W. McQuaid, suggested that the only state-wide . newspaper in New Hampshire was ready to again assert itself as a player . in the GOP primary.'We don't . have to agree with them on every issue,' the newspaper wrote in an . editorial that ran across the width of the front page.

Massachusetts governor. That . led to the rise, and fall, of potential challengers such as Mr . Huntsman, Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Texas . Governor Rick Perry. Yet with six weeks until the primary, The Union Leader's move could shuffle the race and further boost Gingrich. Endorsed: The paper praised Mr Gingrich's 'innovative, forward-looking strategy and positive leadership' In recent weeks, he has seen a surge . in some polls as Republicans focus more closely on deciding which . candidate they consider best positioned to take on President Barack . Obama. 'A lot of candidates say they're going to . improve Washington.

'A lot of candidates say they're going . to improve Washington,' the newspaper wrote. 'Newt Gingrich has . actually done that, and in this race he offers the best shot of doing it . again.' As voters started . focusing more on the race, Mr Gingrich has turned in solid debate . performances and found his stride on a national stage. He . has rebuilt his campaign after a disastrous summer that saw many of his . top aides resign en masse and fundraising summaries report million in . debt. Qualified: Mr Gingrich once served as the Speaker of the House . In New Hampshire, he brought on . respected tea party leader Andrew Hemingway to lead his efforts and his . team has been contacting almost 1,000 voters each day. Rick Perry will be endorsed by 'America's toughest sheriff' this week, according to NBC News. Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, who fervently backs tough . immigration laws and their enforcement, will campaign with Mr Perry . later this week in New Hampshire, sources say. Mr . Arpaio is currently under investigation by a grand jury for an alleged . abuse of power: He famously provided pink underwear for inmates and . created a tent jail in the desserts of Arizona. Hemingway's . team of eight paid staffers in New Hampshire has been adding more than . 100 volunteers each day, campaign officials said. Mr Gingrich's team has lined up leaders . in the major cities and has started identifying representatives in each . ward in the state. Mr . Gingrich has opened offices in Manchester, New Hampshire's biggest city, . along with Dover in the eastern part of the state and in the North . Country's Littleton. He plans two more. Mr Gingrich hasn't begun television advertising and has refused to go negative on his opponents. Yet The Union Leader's backing could give him a nudge in New Hampshire and provide a steady stream of criticism. Four years earlier, the newspaper threw . its support to Arizona Senator John McCain's bid and used front page . opinion columns and editorials to boost him and criticize chief rival Mr . Romney. In the time . since, Mr Romney has worked to court Union Leader publisher Joe McQuaid, . who often runs columns on the newspaper's front page under his . signature. ‘The Union Leader's style is we don't . just endorse once,’ McQuaid told The Washington Post in 1999. ‘We . endorse every damn day. We started endorsing Reagan in 1975 and never . stopped.’ Nobody's perfect: The newspaper said 'Newt Gingrich is by no means the perfect candidate' Preferences: 'We would rather back someone with whom we may sometimes disagree than one who tells us what he thinks we want to hear' Mr Romney and . his wife, Ann, had dinner with the McQuaids at the Bedford Village Inn . near Manchester, hoping to reset the relationship earlier this year. Yet it didn't prove enough and Mr McQuaid's newspaper seemed not to appreciate the outreach. ‘Newt Gingrich is by no means the perfect candidate,’ Mr McQuaid wrote. ‘But .

The woman who claims to have allowed 84-year-old Powerball winner Gloria Mackenzie cut in line when she bought her lucky ticket said today she doesn't regret the decision - even though it might have cost her $590million. Mindy Crandall, 34, says allowing the elderly Mackenzie to buy her lottery ticket first taught her young daughter an important lesson about kindness. When Mackenzie came forward on Wednesday to finally claim her prize - two weeks after the record May 18 drawing - she thanked the anonymous woman who let her cut in line at that Publix grocery store in Zephyhills, Florida. Mackenzie has since left the tin-roof duplex where she resided in Zephyrhills and moved in with her son Scott, who lives in a modest home in a working-class neighborhood in Jacksonville. She said she plans to split her winnings with him. Not the winner: Mindy Crandell says she could possibly have won $590million if she had not allowed Glorida Mackenzie to step in front of her in line . Very wealthy: This is the 84-year-old widow Gloria Mackenzie who just claimed a $590.5million jackpot . Neighbors say the elderly millionaire plans to continue living with Scott in Florida - albeit in a slightly bigger home. It's unknown how she will split her winnings with her other three children and her grandchildren. 'It could have been us, but things happen. Sometimes it's better to be patient than right. I knew we were teaching our daughter the right thing,' told ABC News. Mrs Crandall says she believes she is the woman Mrs Mackenzie was talking about when she revealed in her public statement: 'While in line at Publix, another lottery player was kind enough to let me go ahead of them in line to purchase the winning Quick Pick ticket.' Mrs Crandall, who lives in Zephyhills - the same small city where Mrs Mackenzie retired, told ABC News that she still remembers the elderly woman who stepped in front of her while she was waiting in line to buy her Powerball tickets last month. Mrs Crandall says she was tending to her children at the time and didn't notice that someone had cut the line. 'My 10-year-old said, ""Mom, There's a lady in front of us."" I noticed that the lady was there. Didn't pay a lot of mind to it,' she told ABC. Buzz: News of the winning ticket being sold in Zephyhills, Florida, brought international attention to the small city . When Mrs Mackenzie made it to the register, the clerk motioned for Mrs Crandall to come forward instead. Mrs Crandall waited. 'Go ahead,' she told the elderly Mrs Mackenzie. 'The joke was, that's the lady that's going to win it. I was like, ""Yeah right. No one is going to win from little Zephyrhills,"" Mrs Crandall said. Mrs Mackenzie, a widow and with four children and at least four grandchildren, also said in her statement that she is planning to split her winnings with her son, 54-year-old Scott Mackenzie, who lives in Jacksonville, Florida. She declined to appear at the Florida Lottery news conference announcing her winnings on Wednesday and refused to speak with reporters as she left lottery headquarters. She opted to take the lump sum payment of $370million - which will result in winnings after taxes of about $278million. The door on the left is Mrs Mackenzie's home. Before her lottery win, she lived in this squat, modest duplex in Zephyhills, Florida . Home sweet home: Mrs Mackenzie's home front door has a sign that reads 'Private. No soliciting.' Mrs Mackenzie, . who was the wife of a machine technician at a Maine paper mill, left the . trailer park where she spent more than two decades last year so that . she could move into a low-income housing duplex across the street from a . cow pasture. The building was worth just $105,000. Now she can buy the . entire property more than 2,500 times over. When . Mrs Mackenzie's former neighbor Nancy Williams, 79, learned that she . had won millions, she responded: 'Oh bless her heart. Lord knows she . could use it, too.' Mrs Williams lives in the well-kept . trailer park where Mrs Mackenzie spent 25 years with her husband Ralph. She said that Mrs Mackenzie came over every Sunday to visit with her . neighbor and talk about family. Not a word: Mrs Mackenzie and her son Scott, right, did not speak to anyone in the media as they filed out of the Florida Lottery headquarters . Larry MacKenzie, whose Facebook page says he's single, likes Nascar and action movies, could not be reached for comment . She said her grown children came to visit several times - even her family still living in Maine. 'She . never complained about anything. She was very nice and very friendly. We'd sit here and talk over an hour every Sunday,' Mrs Williams said. Mrs Mackenzie bought four other Powerball tickets for the May 18 drawing, but the winning scorecard was her final purchase. Last year, she moved from her trailer to a small grey duplex across the street of a cow pasture. Her old Ford Taurus sedan still sits out front. News that a millionaire is living next door was pretty shocking to most of her neighbors, but in a good way. 'I was floored. I was shaking,' said a neighbor. 'I had no idea, I'm still shaking, I don't believe it. It's hard to believe.' 'We ain't seen her in awhile,' said . another neighbor Sharon Cecil. 'I know she has kids I don't know where . they're from or anything, but they might have come and got her!' 'I remember one time someone came and . stole her alumninum off her air conditioning and somebody was replacing . it and that's when I actually got to see her more,' said another . neighbor James Hill.

A gay couple is pursuing a discrimination complaint against a Colorado bakery, saying the business refused them a wedding cake to honor their Massachusetts ceremony. The couple are alleging the owners have a history of turning away same-sex couples. As more states move to legalize same-sex marriage and civil unions, the case highlights a growing tension between gay rights advocates and supporters of religious freedom. Scroll down for video... David Mullins, left, and Charlie Craig, right, allege their order for a rainbow wedding cake was turned down by a Colorado bakery because of their sexual orientation . Married: The couple tied the knot in July of 2012 but ended up getting their cake from somewhere else . 'Religious freedom is a fundamental right in America and it's something that we champion at the ACLU,' said Mark Silverstein, the legal director of the group in Colorado, which filed the complaint on behalf of the couple. 'We are all entitled to our religious beliefs and we fight for that. But someone's personal religious beliefs don't justify breaking the law by discriminating against others in the public sphere.' The attorney for Jack Phillips, one of the owners of Masterpiece Cakeshop, sees it differently. 'We don't believe that this is a case about commerce. At its heart, this is a case about conscience,' said Nicolle Martin. She said the matter is important because it will serve as an example for future cases across the country as more gay couples gain legal recognitions for their relationships. 'It brings it to the forefront. I just don't think that we should heighten one person's beliefs over and above another person's beliefs,' she said. Owner: Jack Philips says that he believes in Jesus Christ and because of his religion does not wish to make cakes for same-sex couples . Habit: The couple say they are not the only gay couple to have had their order refused on the grounds of their sexuality . The Colorado Attorney General's office filed a formal complaint last week after the ACLU initiated the process last year on behalf of David Mullins and Charlie Craig. The case is scheduled for a hearing in September before Colorado's Civil Rights Commission. Nationwide, 12 states now allow gay marriage, with Rhode Island, Delaware and Minnesota doing so this year. And in a year that Colorado lawmakers approved civil unions, they also elected the first gay Speaker of the House. But Colorado's civil union law does not provide religious protections for businesses despite the urging of Republican lawmakers. Democrats argued that such a provision would give businesses cover to discriminate. Priorities: In another instance a gay couple had their order refused but when told the order was for a dog, the bakery happily agreed to proceed . Tensions: As more states move to legalize same-sex marriage and civil unions, the case highlights a growing tension between gay rights advocates and supporters of religious freedom . Mullins, 28, and Craig, 33, filed the discrimination complaint against Phillips after visiting his business in suburban Denver last summer. After a few minutes looking at pictures of different cakes, the couple said Phillips told them he wouldn't make one for them when he found out it was to celebrate their wedding in Colorado after they got married in Massachusetts. Phillips has said making a wedding cake for gay couples would violate his Christian religious beliefs, according to the complaint. 'We were all very upset, but I was angry and I felt dehumanized and mortified,' Mullins said. He said he vented his frustration on Facebook and was surprised at how 'the story ended up catching fire,' with responses from local media and bloggers in other countries posting about it. 'We felt that the best way to honor the support that they had given us was to follow this complaint through,' he said. In the process, the ACLU said they found out about two other gay couples who had been refused a wedding cake from the same shop. Both have written affidavits in support of the discrimination claim. Recent advances on gay rights only underscore Colorado's difficult past on the issue. In 2006, voters banned gay marriage. Now what? Colorado law says it¿s illegal to discriminate based on sexual orientation in employment and housing. But when it comes to things like selling cakes, the law is less than clear . More notably, in 1992, voters approved a ban on municipal antidiscrimination laws to protect gays, leading some to brand Colorado a 'hate state.' Four years later, the U.S. Supreme Court said the law, known as Amendment 2, was unconstitutional. The complaint seeks to force Masterpiece Cakeshop to 'cease and desist' the practice of refusing wedding cakes for gay couples, and to tell the public that their business is open to everyone. If Phillips loses the case and refuses to comply with the order, he would face fines of $500 per case and up to a year in jail, his attorney said . 'It would force him to choose between his conscience and a paycheck. I just think that's an intolerable choice,' Martin said.","Cake shop refused to bake a cake for gay couple specifically because of their sexual orientation .

Drinking alcohol in moderation could slash the risk of rheumatoid arthritis, according to new research. Some regular drinkers were nearly half as likely to develop the crippling condition as teetotallers or those who rarely drank. Researchers discovered the connection after carrying out an extensive review of previous studies that looked into the role of alcohol and rheumatoid arthritis. The results, published in the journal Rheumatology, suggest a few drinks a week could have a protective effect against a disease that affects around 600,000 people in the UK. Although the latest investigation did not look at the reasons why a regular tipple might offer some protection, earlier research suggested it could be because alcohol appears to dampen down inflammation in the body and also has a mild pain-killing effect. Rheumatoid arthritis is triggered when the immune system, the body's in-built defence mechanism, goes into action unnecessarily, attacking joints and sometimes other parts of the body. The reasons why remain a mystery but some evidence suggests exposure to mild infection may be enough to launch this over-reaction. As a result, joints become inflamed and swollen, causing pain or stiffness, and many sufferers also experience flu-like symptoms. In very severe cases, they can end up crippled and unable to live a full or active life. Several small studies in recent years . have hinted that drinking moderate amounts of alcohol could reduce the . risks of developing the incurable condition. Animal studies, for example, indicate . mice are less likely to suffer arthritis if they have small amounts of . alcohol added to their drinking water. Rheumatoid arthritis is a crippling condition that causes extreme pain and in some cases deformity . Now researchers from King's College London have carried out a meta-analysis, where data from earlier investigations are pooled to provide a more definitive answer. They gathered findings from nine different studies involving a total of nearly 12,000 patients. When they combined all the results they found that regular drinkers were 48 per cent less likely to be diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. However, the benefits were confined to patients who tested positive for anti-citrulllinated protein antibodies. These are proteins that are released into the bloodstream when the disease in emerging and can often be detected before any symptoms appear. They affect around two-thirds of arthritis sufferers and their presence indicates a more severe form of the disease. Patients who tested negative for the protein, which suggests they have a milder form of the disease, saw little or no benefit from regular drinking. In a report on their findings the researchers said: 'Alcohol intake is inversely associated with ACPA-positive rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting a protective effect. 'But further research is needed to confirm this relationship.'","British review of studies found alcohol to have a protective effect against rheumatoid arthritis .

A mother has to keep her five-year-old daughter locked out of the kitchen at all times - because a rare condition means she could eat herself to death. Ava Carvey has Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) which leaves her constantly hungry meaning the family kitchen has to be kept behind bars. Her mother, Marika Carvey, 35, has to keep Ava on a strict low calorie diet to prevent her overeating. Five-year-old Ava Carvey (with mother Marika) has Prader-Willi syndrome, which means she is constantly hungry . She was diagnosed when she was nine-weeks-old because doctors noticed she was not moving or feeding properly . Mrs Carvey, from Bromley, said: ‘If Ava had access to the food, she would eat whatever she could lay her hands on. ‘She's not just permanently hungry - she's ravenous. If there's food on the floor, she'll pick it up and eat it, and if someone else has food she wants theirs too. She'll even take food away and hide it. ‘It's scary because if we didn't watch her she'd eat until her she made herself sick. ‘When she gets older we will have to put locks on the fridge and cupboards too. ‘She's such a lovely little girl and sometimes I feel so sorry for her - imagine always feeling like you're starving. ‘It must be horrible but she's always got a smile on her face, she's always running about enjoying herself just like any other five-year-old.’ Ava was diagnosed with the genetic condition at just nine-weeks-old after doctors noticed she was failing to feed and move around properly. The condition also means her body burns calories very slowly so she is in danger of obesity . She has to be locked out of the family kitchen to prevent her eating too much . She gets so hungry that her mother must ensure her other children, Joshua, 11, and Finnian, two, never eat in front of her.Mrs Carvey said: ‘If Ava sees her brothers eating she'll try to take their food, so we have to make sure that if she's not eating, no-one else is. ‘PWS sufferers are prone to tantrums, so if we go out to eat we have to be very careful. I'll ask the waiters to give her a smaller portion, and as soon as we finish a meal at a restaurant, we have to leave immediately. ‘If she noticed other people's food she'd start getting upset - or try and eat the leftovers. ‘If we go to parties with a buffet it can be a bit of nightmare. She'll just stand by the table and eat whatever she wants on it. We have to watch her like a hawk and often have to leave if she doesn't get what she wants.’ When she goes to a restaurant she has to leave as soon as she has finished her food because she becomes distressed if she sees others eating when she is not . If she was allowed to she would eat until she was sick . PWS also means that sufferers don't burn energy as quickly as the average person, leading them to gain weight easily. Mrs Carvey, therefore, has to ensure that Ava only eats healthy food as she could easily become obese. She said: ‘Obesity is a common problem in children with PWS. Instead of sweets and biscuits, she has raisins and rice cakes for her treats. ‘I've never given her Easter eggs and on her birthday she has jelly instead of a cake. ‘She does have tantrums sometimes, especially if there's food around and she can't have it, but most of the time she's a really happy little girl. Ava's brothers are not allowed to eat in front of her as she has tantrums if tempted with food she is not allowed . ‘We keep her busy between meals, and she's starting to understand that the PWS makes her hungry but doesn't stop her eating. She's doing really well. ‘Her brothers are really good with her too, especially Joshua as he's old enough to understand what PWS is about. Finnian isn't quite so sure though - I try and slip him a treat every now and then when Ava's not around.’ Mrs Carvey, and her husband Martyn, 32, were told about Ava's condition when she was just nine-weeks-old. Mrs Carvey said: ‘The day after Ava was born it became clear that things weren't quite right. ‘She wasn't moving much and hadn't fed. I wasn't too worried but the doctors were looking at her a bit strangely and all of a sudden she was whisked off to special care. Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare genetic condition. It causes a constant desire to eat, dangerous weight gain, restricted growth, reduced muscle tone, learning disabilities and behavioural problems. It affects on in every 15,000 children born in the UK. Children with the condition will eat three to six times more than other children and will still want more. There is no cure but the condition itself is not life threatening. However, people with the syndrome often develop obesity related conditions such as type 2 diabetes and heart failure. ‘The next thing I knew she was being transferred to St Thomas's Hospital in London for tests. ‘By this stage she wasn't moving at all - apart from her eyes - and she couldn't even cry. She still hadn't fed either, it was just awful. ‘We were in a ward where all these children were covered in tubes and we wondered if Ava was going to end up like that too. ‘The doctors were running test after test but we asked them not to tell us what they thought she had until they were certain. ‘We didn't want to start Googling all these medical conditions that she could have and worry ourselves needlessly.’ Nine weeks later Ava’s parents were finally told that she had been diagnosed with PWS. Marika said: ‘I'd heard of the condition before because I know Katie Price's son has it, but I wasn't really sure what it involved. ‘They gave us some leaflets and told us about some groups we could join, but we asked if we could just have six months alone to get used to the idea. ‘We were lucky because we knew about Ava's PWS from a very young age, so she never got very big. We were able to control it.’ As Ava grows older, there is a concern that it will be harder to keep her PWS under control. As she is on a low calorie diet Ava has jelly for her birthday instead of birthday cake . Mrs Carvey said: ‘The older she gets and the bigger she gets, it's going to be harder for me to stop her eating. ‘She's already quite a restless sleeper, so when she's older she could easily get out of bed in the middle of the night and eat anything she wanted. ‘I do worry that she'll form a bad relationship with food, and I'd hate for her worry about her body and things like that, but for now she's doing really well. ‘She's an adorable little girl, with a really happy, affectionate personality, and we love her to bits.’ A spokesman for the PWS Association said: ‘PWS is a genetic condition, usually not hereditary, which is present from birth and affects a person throughout their entire life. When Ava was a baby she underwent a barrage of tests before being diagnosed with Prader-Willi syndrome . ‘Its main features are an almost constant feeling of hunger and consequent desire to eat, low muscle tone, short stature, immature sexual development, immature emotional and social development and, in most cases, learning disability. ‘Children with PWS have a much higher risk than other children of becoming obese at an early age because of two key factors: overeating and low muscle tone - the latter meaning that they do not burn up energy as fast as other children. ‘They also have more fat mass and less lean body mass than other children. Muscle burns more energy than fat, so again there is less burning up of energy in PWS. ‘While growth hormone treatment is now helping many children with PWS increase their height and muscle strength, parents must still put controls in place to prevent their children from eating and provide a lower calorie diet to enable their child to maintain a healthy weight.’","Ava Carvey was diagnosed with Prader-Willi syndrome at nine-weeks-old .

They found it significantly improves muscle function, right down to the muscle fibre level. A study which put muscle fibres under the microscope found cells were arranged differently in post-menopausal women taking HRT compared with those who did not. The difference reduced age-related changes and improved muscle function, the researchers said. A new study has found HRT significantly improves muscle function . An estimated one million women in the UK are prescribed HRT in their 50s to replace oestrogen lost in the menopause. It can combat symptoms such as hot flushes and mood changes. HRT is known to slow bone loss and increase bone density, and reverse declining levels of skin collagen, which is responsible for the stretch in skin and muscle. Previous studies have suggested HRT reduces the drop in muscle mass and strength in post-menopausal women, improving the ability to jump higher and walk faster than those not taking drugs. The latest study, in Sweden, is the first to explore these effects at cellular and molecular levels to find how the changes are occurring. Researchers at Uppsala University Hospital observed six pairs of post-menopausal identical twins – of whom only one of each pair was receiving HRT – to rule out genetic differences. They then examined muscle biopsies taken from them, says a report published in The Journal of Physiology. Women take HRT to combat symptoms such as hot flushes and mood changes . They found HRT had a significant effect on slow-twitch muscle fibres, enabling cells to work more efficiently. Dr Lars Larsson, from Uppsala University Hospital, said negative publicity over the past decade has made many women reluctant to use HRT, but the study shows a positive outcome. He said: ‘Even though individual muscle fibres did not change in size, the muscles of HRT users showed greater strength by generating a higher maximum force compared to non-HRT users. It is thought that using HRT, at least in part, reduces modifications of muscle contractile proteins that are linked to ageing. ‘HRT is also associated with a more efficient organisation of myonuclei, which are essential components for muscle fibre function.’ Experts last year reappraised HRT risks after claims that users were at higher risk of breast cancer, heart disease and strokes – contrary to previous research suggesting oestrogen protected them from heart problems. Re-analysis of data from the US Women’s Health Initiative found the extra health risks applied to older patients in their 60s and 70s, who do not normally use HRT but were given it for research purposes. It showed women taking HRT at the start of the menopause for ten years can reduce their risk of heart failure, heart attacks and premature death.",Those who took HRT had reduced age-related changes and improved muscle function .

Women with a high risk of breast cancer could soon be given a drug to reduce their chance of getting the disease. Landmark research has found that taking the hormone pill tamoxifen - or three other similar drugs - can reduce the risk by 40 per cent. The aim is to reduce the odds of . developing breast cancer in the first place – just as statins are given . to patients to ward off heart disease. Cancer Research UK estimates that up . to 10 per cent of women are considered to be at high risk of breast . cancer - equivalent to around half a million people. The study found that taking osteoporosis drugs can reduce the risk of breast cancer by 40 per cent . Tamoxifen has been used to treat the . illness for more than 30 years, usually after surgery, saving the lives . of hundreds of thousands at a cost of just a few pence a day. But it is not currently approved as a preventative treatment for breast cancer in the UK. The other drugs involved in the . research, raloxifene, arzoxifene, and lasofoxifene, are all primarily . treatments for the fragile bone disease osteoporosis. The . National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the watchdog . responsible for advising the NHS on good practice, provisionally . recommended the medication in January. It is likely to make a decision in the summer, in a move that could benefit up to half a million women. A new study into the medical records of 83,000 women revealed that taking the drugs reduced the risk of developing breast cancer by 38 per cent. After five years of taking the medication the risk fell by 42 per cent. There was still a reduction of 25 per cent in women who had stopped taking the pill for five years. After five years of taking the medication the risk of breast cancer fell by 42 per cent . Tamoxifen, a hormone pill already used to treat breast cancer, has the same effect as the bone disease drugs . The drugs, known as selective oestrogen receptor modulators, target oestrogen-sensitive molecules on cells in the breast and other parts of the body. Professor Jack Cuzick, from Queen Mary, University of London, who led the research said: ‘These are very encouraging results. ‘[They] pave the way for more widespread use of these drugs in high risk women in a manner similar to the way statins and blood pressure lowering drugs are used to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.’ The risk of . breast cancer in the general population is one in eight – but this rises . to one in three for women at high risk and one in four for those at . moderate risk. Almost 50,000 . women a year are diagnosed with breast cancer. Of these, around 2,400 . have inherited faults in known breast cancer genes while a further . 5,000-7,000 are affected by genes not yet identified. Previous international trials showed . that tamoxifen reduces the risk of the most common kind of breast cancer . by one third after five years, with the preventative effect lasting up . to 20 years. Experts say the cost to the NHS would be relatively low because the drugs are not branded - plus fewer women would need treating for the disease. Many breast cancers rely on the female sex hormone oestrogen to grow. These cancers are known as oestrogen-receptor positive (ER-positive) breast cancers . Hormone-positive breast cancer cells have proteins called receptors, which sex hormones attach to. When oestrogen comes into contact with the receptors, it . fits into them and stimulates the cancer cells to divide so that the . tumour grows. Tamoxifen fits into the oestrogen receptor and blocks . oestrogen from reaching the cancer cells. This means the cancer either . grows more slowly or stops growing altogether. But despite the positive results from the research, the study showed that the drugs significantly increased the risk of blood clots, while tamoxifen raises the risk of developing womb cancer. Hazel Nunn of Cancer Research UK, which funded the study, said: ‘These results provide some of the clearest evidence to date of the ability of these drugs to prevent breast cancer. The study also offers clarity on the frequency of side effects that can be expected from these drugs. She added: ‘Research like this has the potential to reduce the number of women diagnosed with the disease in the future. ‘We look forward to the final guidance from Nice and hope this marks the time when women have more options to reduce their risk of breast cancer. These drugs have a range of side-effects though, so they will not be suitable for all women. We urge them to discuss their options with their doctors.’","The hormone pill Tamoxifen is already used to treat breast cancer .

It seems there is only one thing more irritating than the rotund opera singer from the Go Compare TV commercials – any attempt to do away with him. Two commercials where the character was attacked drew more complaints than any other to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) last year. The Italian character, Gio Compario, created by Welsh singer Wynne Evans, was designed to be deliberately annoying as he repeatedly blasted out the company jingle. Scroll down for videos . An ad showing Go Compare's opera-singing character Gio Compario being kicked in the stomach by Stuart Pearce generated over 1,000 complaints . Opera singer Gio Compario lies injured on the ground. Viewers complained the ad was potentially harmful to children . Stuart Pearce as he appears in the ad . Unsurprisingly, the price comparison website thought the nation would welcome a series of creative and funny efforts to wipe him off our TV screens. However, it appears many were upset by the dastardly comic book methods they came up with. The first commercial featured former England left back, Stuart Pearce, who is famous for his hefty left foot, aiming a football at the annoying Gio. More than 1,000 people complained that kicking a football into the singer’s stomach was likely to set a bad example to children. The ASA disagreed, insisting most people would understand it was light-hearted and comical. The second commercial saw Sue Barker, the BBC sports presenter and former tennis player, firing a rocket launcher at the character in a bid to kill him off. This time there were 797 complaints from people who were unhappy at the suggested violence. Again the ASA backed the company, saying the images were clearly meant to be a joke, while Gio was unharmed. The two commercials feature at the . top of a list of the ten most complained about advertisements of 2012 in . the watchdog’s annual report published today. In . third place was a more serious advertisement by Channel 4 for its . controversial series, My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, which was deemed to have . sexualised a teenage girl. The poster showed the 15-year-old . blonde, who was heavily made up, spilling out of a low cut top that . revealed her breasts and cleavage. The . broadcaster was also criticised over a second poster of a 10-year-old . boy with an aggressive expression which was deemed to have stereotyped . youngsters from the traveller community. One commercial saw Sue Barker, the BBC sports presenter and former tennis player, firing a rocket launcher at the Go Compare character in a bid to kill him off . The watchdog’s annual report reveals that it rejected the vast majority of the 31,298 complaints received about 18,990 ads last year. Among those to be cleared were images of a naked rambler character in a TV ad for Richmond ham, which provoked complaints from more than 300 viewers that it was unsuitable to be seen by children. Asda came under fire last Christmas for a commercial that suggested the job of preparing for the festivities was essentially woman’s work. Women complained it promoted sexist stereotypes while men, including Fathers for Justice, were unhappy that it failed to recognise the value of dads. However, the ASA sided with the supermarket which produced research showing that mums really do carry the burden of organising Christmas. The organisation received more than 300 complaints about advertisements on the YouTube channel of the Paddy Power betting firm, which poked fun at transsexuals. It could not make a ruling as the firm is based in Ireland, however it did censure the firm over a similar commercial that appeared on British TV. Surprisingly, the St John’s Ambulance was responsible for one of the most controversial advertisements of the year. Its TV ad showed a man and his family coping with his diagnosis, treatment and eventual recovery from cancer, only for him to die by choking to death on a piece of food. More than 144 complained, however the ASA ruled the strong storyline was justified because it carried an important message that relatively simple first aid techniques can prevent a tragedy. Other commercials in the top ten, included a Morrisons ad where a dog was apparently being fed Christmas pudding, which might be harmful, and a Kellogg’s cereal ad which some thought was distressing because it showed a man being attacked by a snake. The ASA partly upheld complaints about a TV ad for the Kayak Software Corporation which showed a man receiving brain surgery. Some viewers thought the theme was distressing. The watchdog’s work led to just 3,700 ads being changed or withdrawn last year. Its chairman, Lord Smith, the former Labour Culture Secretary, said: ‘We want to make sure that consumers aren’t being misled, misinformed, harmed or offended. ‘They need to be able to make proper, informed choices about what products and services are available to them. And we want to make sure that there is a fair comparison between advertisers, so that responsible marketing isn’t being under-cut by the irresponsible.’ 1.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening announced yesterday that the UK will end its aid programme with South Africa . Britain is to stop giving millions of pounds of aid every year to South Africa, Justine Greening said yesterday. The International Development Secretary said Britain’s relationship with the country, one of the richest in Africa, should be about trade and should no longer be about handouts. The Government’s aid programme to South Africa is currently worth £19million a year, but will stop by 2015, she said. The decision provoked a furious reaction from a spokesman for the South African government, who accused Britain of ending the aid budget unilaterally and warned that it could redefine the relationship between the two states. But the Department for International Development insisted that it had notified Pretoria about the decision months ago. South Africa is one of the richest countries on the continent, and the UK wants to target its aid budget towards the poorest nations. The country now accounts for over a third of sub-Saharan Africa’s gross domestic product, and is a member of the BRICS  (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) group of emerging economies and the G20. Britain has already announced that direct bilateral aid to India will also end by 2015. However, despite these decisions, Britain’s aid budget is still soaring to 0.7 per cent of GDP while domestic services are facing cuts. Ms Greening made the announcement at a conference of African ministers and business leaders in London yesterday. ‘South Africa has made enormous progress over the past two decades, to the extent that it is now the region’s economic powerhouse and Britain’s biggest trading partner in Africa,’ she said. ‘We are proud of the work the UK has done in partnership with the South African government, helping the country’s transition from apartheid to a flourishing, growing democracy. ‘I have agreed with my South African counterparts that South Africa is now in a position to fund its own development. Britain's aid budget to support countries such as Haiti, pictured, is still soaring to 0.7 per cent of GDP . ‘It is right that our relationship changes to one of mutual co-operation and trade, one that is focused on delivering benefits for the people of Britain and South Africa as well as for Africa as a whole.’ But last night the South African government accused Britain of ending the aid budget unilaterally. Clayson Monyela, spokesman for the country’s international relations department, said: ‘This is such a major decision with far-reaching implications on the projects that are currently running, and it is tantamount to redefining our relationship. ‘Ordinarily, the UK government should have informed the government of South Africa through official diplomatic channels of their intentions and allowed for proper consultations to take place, and the modalities of the announcement agreed on.’ He said it had been expected that a review of the UK-South Africa strategy and decisions about how to move forward, including on direct aid, would take place later this year at a bilateral forum. ‘This unilateral announcement no doubt will affect how our bilateral relations going forward will be conducted,’ he said. ‘We are however, looking forward to the SA/UK bilateral forum later this year to clear up this matter among others.’ But Britain’s Department for International Development said it had held months long discussions with South African government over ending aid. A spokesman said: ‘Today’s announcement comes after months of discussions with the South African government. DfID ministers and senior officials have met with the South African government on many occasions to discuss our decision.’ South Africa is the UK’s 24th biggest trading partner, with annual trade amounting to £10.5billion.","UK will stop aid programme with South Africa by 2015 says Justine Greening .

A robber who ripped a wedding ring from the finger of a 94-year-old widow who had not taken it off in 60 years has been jailed. Slovakian Marion Pokuta, 22, attacked frail Doris Burnett, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, in her home in Bradford on January 16 while he had been released on bail for another theft. Mrs Burnett died two months later. She had been living in her home for 13 years supported by her family but was so distressed by the robbery she was moved to a nursing home and suffered a stroke on March 27. Devoted wife: Doris Burnett, pictured left and right, had not taken off her wedding ring in 60 years . Although she had dementia, the widow would tell the home's manager about a man who stole her wedding ring. Prosecutor Philip Adams said: 'It left a profound effect on her in the final months of her life.' Mrs Burnett married husband John at the age of 34 and the couple remained together for 30 years before he died. Both worked in the mills in Bradford but the couple never had children. After the case at Bradford Crown Court, Mrs Burnett's nephew Clifford Lupton described Pokuta as 'despicable'. He said: 'The way he took it was terrible. That ring had not been off her finger for 60 years.' Despicable: Slovakian Marion Pokuta has been jailed for seven years after carrying out a string of robberies on elderly people . Mr Lupton's wife, Diane, 65, added: 'She was tough but we had to put her in the home and she only lasted eight weeks. 'I think it did make her health deteriorate, she always wanted to stay in her own little house and she wanted a birthday card from the Queen and she would have got one if it hadn’t been for this idiot.' Sentencing Pokuta for seven years, Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC, said: 'I wish I could order your deportation. 'What you did was wicked and cowardly.' In another attack, the court heard how Pokuta demanded a glass of water and was invited into the home of Laura Clarke, 92. He pushed Mrs Clarke, who walks with a stick, to the ground before snatching her jewellery. Pokuta pleaded guilty to stealing two gold chains from her neck in her home in Bradford on November 4 last year. The court heard this was third time Pokuta had targeted the dementia sufferer in her home. In December 2010, he twice stole money from her and was given a four-month jail sentence. Speaking outside court, Mrs Clarke described how she suffered a heart attack two days after the attack and spent a week in hospital recovering. The great-grandmother said: 'I’m lucky compared to some of his other victims but it very nearly killed me - I must have had a guardian angel looking over me that day. 'I’m getting over it a bit better now but I couldn’t sleep for a while. It still comes back into my head whenever there’s a knock on the door and I never answer it alone.' Pokuta's solicitor advocate, Kam Dhesi, mitigating said his family was horrified and ashamed. Detective Constable Sean Donoghue, of West Yorkshire Police, added: 'These were disgraceful and despicable acts against some of the most vulnerable members of our community. 'Pokuta targeted his victims in the full knowledge that they would not be able to defend themselves and would succumb to superior force. 'The fact that he physically pulled a wedding ring from the fingers of one of his victims is a clear indication of his conscienceless character.'","Marion Pokuta attacked Doris Burnett in her Bradford home while he on bail .

The British sailor missing in the Pacific is a company executive based in Japan whose fiancée watched in terror as he was swept into rough seas during an ambitious 16,000 yacht trip. Luke Stimson, 38, had been attempting to sail from Osaka, Japan, to Southampton with Laura Vernon, 35, when he fell overboard into the Pacific Ocean in the early hours of Sunday. As their vessel was battered by six-foot waves she could only look on helpless as Mr Stimson disappeared in raging seas 2,000 miles from the coast of Hawaii. After raising the alarm via satellite phone Miss Vernon was plucked from the stricken craft by a U.S. Navy rescue helicopter. A massive search operation has so far failed to find any trace of her fiancé. Their boat, named Jonetsu, Japanese for 'passion for life', has been left adrift in the ocean after attempts to moor it to a warship failed. The U.S. Navy and Coastguard continued their efforts to find Mr Stimson but warned that 'challenging' conditions might hamper the search. Coast Guard officer Eric Chandler said: 'It's real challenging out there. We can't get our cutters out there.' He told the Evening Standard that although the location where Mr Stimson was lost is remote it was not unusual for yachts to be so far from land. 'People often sail pretty far out of reach,' he said. 'I don't think that it's that unusual for him to be out there.' Mr Stimson is Asian director of UK flower firm David Austin Roses, based in Albrighton, Shropshire, and had been spearheading the company's successful Japanese operation since 2009. His mother Betty, 65, was too distressed to speak from her home in Wellington, Shropshire, today, but she confirmed Luke had been with his fiancée when he was swept overboard. 'It's a very distressing time,' she said.

You may kiss the bride: After all the splashing around in the sea, the couple get to the highlight of the ceremony and seal the ceremony with a kiss . The wedding picture: Most people are surrounded by the ornate architecture of a church, but Mr and Mrs Engler's wedding picture will be that of sea and wetsuits . Still time for tradition: The now Mrs Engler throws her bouquet to relatives watching the service . Audience: Friends and relatives - some of whom were concerned about the extreme wedding - look on teary-eyed as the couple are married . Wedding dance: The couple have the equivalent of a jet pack dance on the water, to the sound of Frank Sinatra's Come Fly With Me . And . it was 25-year-old hotel manager Mr Engler's choice of T-shirt - one . bearing a Zozi logo during his proposal to his beloved partner - that opened . the door to their bizarre service this week. He . had enlisted a stranger to photograph his proposal on the Mexican . shoreline and later sent his picture to the adventure company to say . thanks for providing the perfect setting. The company later approached the pair and offered them the chance to wed by jet pack. Zozi's offer was eventually was accepted - but not before some cautious words from Mr Engler's new in-laws - parents Roger and Anna. Beaming bride: Mrs Engler is all smiles at the wedding. Her white surfing vest provided an alternative to a flowing white dress . Mrs Engler poses with her mother Anna who was initially quite reluctant for her daughter to be married wearing a jet pack, but came round to the idea after being assured it was safe . Together: The couple stroll along the beach, with the groom in his black wetsuit and white bow tie . 'They were kind of quiet,' said Mrs Engler. 'They were curious if it was safe.' She added: 'They're not ultra conservative, but they just didn't want to miss out on any of the traditions that as parents I'm sure they were looking forward to once I was engaged.' The Jetlev R200 retails at an introductory price of $99,500, according to Jetlev's website. The jet pack ostensibly straps to the user, and is connected by a 30-foot hose to a boat unit that feeds water to power the device.","Grant Engler and Amanda Volf have world's first jet pack weddin, arriving for the ceremony from the air above the sea .

There were no warning signs that anything was wrong – indeed, he seemed to be in perfect health. But his heart simply stopped beating. ‘He was sitting on the bed, texting, and that was it. It was like switching off a light,’ explains his sister Katherine. She was told about the harrowing events later by Simon’s two best friends who were with him. Scroll down for video . Life and soul: Simon McNamara, who died aged 25 of SADS, with his sister Katherine at a wedding . ‘They did all they could,’ she says. ‘They called for help and a nurse was there within minutes, but there . was no hope. He had gone. ‘Waiting . at Gatwick Airport for Si’s luggage, but knowing he wouldn’t be coming . through the doors too, was perhaps the hardest thing I have ever done. I . just felt as if I couldn’t possibly go on.’ After . a post-mortem failed to determine a definite cause, the tragedy in July . 2008 was attributed to Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome (SADS), a . catch-all term for an undiagnosed heart condition. Shockingly, the syndrome kills 12 Britons aged between 14 and 35 every week. In . 1992, Daniel Yorath, the son of former Wales footballer Terry Yorath . and the brother of TV presenter Gabby Logan, died from an undiagnosed . heart condition aged 15 while playing in his garden. Tragic event: Simon McNamara, pictured with friends as a teenager, died while on holiday in Croatia in 2008 . Cameroon footballer Marc-Vivien Foe died on the pitch during an international match in France in 2003, while Motherwell captain Phil O’Donnell also collapsed and died during a game against Dundee United in 2007. And just three months ago, Chloe Waddell, a teenage swimming star tipped to represent Team GB at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, died at her home in Greater Manchester after going into cardiac arrest. Like 25-year-old Simon, they were all extremely fit, making their deaths all the more unfathomable. Aside from being an adored son and brother, Simon was also carving out a successful property career, had a flat in Fulham, West London, and planned to marry his girlfriend. ‘Si was extremely intelligent – he got straight As at school and achieved a top 2:1 in his economics degree from Durham University,’ says Katherine, a financial manager from Nottingham. ‘He was the life and soul of the party, stupidly good-looking and incredibly caring.’ In the months after Simon’s death, the McNamara family’s collective grief manifested itself in various ways. ‘I thought I felt my heart break – a sharp, physical pain I’d never experienced before,’ Katherine says. ‘How could I go on without my gorgeous little brother? Shock: Simon, right as a child, was a fit and healthy young man when his heart suddenly stopped beating . ‘Previously, whenever anything had gone wrong in my life, I would turn to my parents, but they were suffering too. We were united, yet I felt incredibly alone. As a sibling, there was a very particular sense of desperation and loneliness.’ Help was at hand from Cardiac Risk in . the Young (CRY), a charity set up in 1995 to help prevent SADS through . better screening. The charity’s teams visit schools and sports clubs . across the country, offering simple heart-monitoring scans that can flag . up abnormalities. It also . provides support for families in mourning thanks to volunteers who train . to become accredited counsellors. Most recently, CRY launched a new . service aimed at helping siblings of SADS victims. ‘When . someone loses a brother or sister, there’s a very real risk of . implosion because they’re not prepared to make themselves – or their . pain – heard,’ says CRY founder Alison Cox. Professor . Richard Schilling, consultant cardiologist at BMI The London . Independent Hospital, believes the best way to prevent SADS is to offer . screening using an echocardiogram (ECG), a painless test that detects . electrical or rhythm problems with the heartbeat. ‘There . may be no warning signs at all,’ he says. ‘But an unexplained collapse . or blackout, a family history of sudden death in the young, or sustained . palpitations – more than a few seconds of feeling your heart race – . could be an indicator.’ Dr Ffion Davies, a consultant in emergency medicine at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, has been campaigning for better awareness of SADS for a decade. ‘Most cases have a genetic origin,’ she explains. ‘Cases tend to come to light in teenagers and those in their early 20s, as the heart grows and matures. Frequently we hear about SADS happening during sport when the heart beats faster and harder, and may also suffer slightly low oxygen levels. ‘If a person already has an abnormal heart structure or a genetic problem with the electrical conduction, exercise may trigger the heart to go into an abnormal rhythm and, in the worst case, a cardiac arrest.’ Katherine, who is now a long-term CRY volunteer, devotes much of her time to spreading this message in a bid to save other families from the same anguish she still experiences. ‘The hardest time for me is January because Si’s birthday was the day after mine. These days, I prefer to lie low and instead of gifts, I ask everyone to donate to CRY. That’s the best possible present because it’s for him too.’ To find out more about CRY’s bereavement support services, click here .

Warning: Professor John Ashton fears private schools could become 'reservoirs of disease' Britain's 600,000 children at private schools face the greatest risk from the measles outbreak and could pose a health threat to the rest of the population, a leading doctor has warned. Professor John Ashton claimed a mix of large numbers of middle-class children who were not vaccinated against measles following the MMR scare in the 1990s, along with pupils from overseas with unknown health records, meant schools could become 'reservoirs of disease'. The professor, who represents the UK's . public health doctors, told the Daily Telegraph the risk was similar to . that from groups such as gypsies and travellers, who have previously . spread the disease. He said: 'You've got a lot of . middle-class, well-off parents, large numbers of whom did not have their . children immunised because of the [Andrew] Wakefield scare [the discredited . doctor who linked the MMR vaccine to autism] - which was a very middle-class . phenomenon. 'Layered . on top of that you have got a lot of children from abroad, especially . from the Far East, from countries such as Hong Kong and China, and there . are few checks being done to establish their immunisation records.' Scroll down for video . Vaccine: A nurse administers the MMR vaccine to two-year-old Sophie O'Sullivan at Neath Port Talbot Hospital . He said private schools were a 'law unto themselves', and warned both pupils and the wider population were being put at risk from infectious diseases because the schools do not have proper policies to protect children and are bad at keeping adequate medical records of pupils from abroad. Prof Ashton, who will soon become president of the Faculty of Public Health, added: ""The danger is that you have a population that can potentially become a reservoir of infection. 'Normally when you are talking about subsections of the population that are at particular risk of disease outbreaks, such as measles, you are talking about groups like gypsies and travellers. 'But actually children in private schools, and in particular boarding schools, are one of the categories most at risk.' He urged independent schools to check immunisation records of overseas pupils as a matter of urgency, and advised them to 'engage with' families who refused to vaccinate their children. Sick child: There has been an epidemic in Wales with cases in the greater Swansea area certain to pass the 1,000 mark over the weekend . Dr David Elliman, an immunisation specialist from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said he believed there was a high chance that an outbreak of measles would occur at an independent school, saying health officials were braced for such a crisis, the Telegraph reported. First victim? Gareth Williams was found dead at his home in Port Tennant . Prof Ashton's warning comes as health chiefs launched a major in-school vaccination drive across three counties neighbouring a region battling a measles epidemic. Thousands of unprotected children are being targeted as part of an exhaustive four week programme to stop the disease spreading in South Wales. The number of measles sufferers in the greater Swansea area looks certain to pass the 1,000 mark over the weekend. Four local hospitals will host drop-in vaccination clinics today, for the fourth consecutive Saturday. Vital vaccination sessions will also continue in a number of Swansea and Neath and Port Talbot schools next week. A parallel programme is now being rolled out across three counties to the west of the city. It . comes as a major £20 million vaccination programme was announced in . England targeting one million unprotected children and teenagers. Gareth Williams, 25, from Swansea, may be the first victim of the epidemic after he was found dead at his flat in Port Tennant. Further tests have been ordered on Mr Williams after a post-mortem proved inclusive.","Mixed with pupils from overseas with unknown health records, these schools could become 'reservoirs of disease' claims Prof John Ashton .

"By . Associated Press Reporter and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:40 EST, 6 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:40 EST, 6 June 2013 . Sarah Murnaghan, the 10-year-old girl in desperate need of a lung transplant moved closer to that goal when the national organ transplant network complied with a judge's order to place her on the adult waiting list. The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network added her to the list on Wednesday night after U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson's original ruling on June 5th U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said on Thursday. The little girl, also remains on the priority list for a lung from a pediatric donor, Sebelius said. However, her family, through their official spokeswoman, said Sarah's condition had worsened through today. Battle: Ten-year-old Sarah Murnaghan has been on the waiting list for a lung transplant for 18 months . Sarah's parents had challenged existing transplant policy that made children under 12 wait for pediatric lungs to become available, or be offered lungs donated by adults after adolescents and adults on the waiting list had been considered. 'We are beyond thrilled,' Janet Murnaghan, the girl's mother, told The Associated Press on Wednesday. 'Obviously we still need a match.' The ruling applied only to Sarah, who has end-stage cystic fibrosis and has been awaiting a transplant at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. An expert has questioned the decision on medical and ethical grounds. In this May 30, 2013 file photo provided by the Murnaghan family, Sarah Murnaghan, center, celebrates the 100th day of her stay in Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with her father, Fran, left, and mother, Janet . Loved: Her mother Janet, pictured, has just learned her daughter has a chance to live - after being approved for the adult organ transplant waiting list . Lung transplants are the most difficult of organ transplants, and children fare worse than adults, which is one reason for the existing policy, said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone Medical Center. He called it troubling, and perhaps precedent-setting, for a judge to overrule that medical judgment, and predicted a run to the courthouse by patients who don't like their place on the waiting list. 'I'm not sure I want judges or congressmen or bureaucrats trying to decide what to do with organs at the bedside,' Caplan said. Sarah's family, who live Newtown Square in suburban Philadelphia, filed suit Wednesday. The Murnaghans say pediatric lungs are rarely donated, so they believe older children should have equal access to adult donations. Baylson suspended the age limit in the nation's transplant rules for 10 days for Sarah, who has been at the Philadelphia hospital for three months. A June 14 hearing on the request has been scheduled for a broader injunction. Holding on: Sarah's mother said her eldest daughter has just three to five weeks left to live . Support: Sarah, who has been living in hospital since February, is pictured with her three younger siblings . Nationwide, about 1,700 people are on the waiting list for a lung transplant, including 31 children under age 11, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Sebelius had declined to become involved in the case earlier this week, despite urgent pleas from several Pennsylvania congressmen. Sebelius said there were three other children at Children's Hospital alone in the same condition as Sarah. She has called for a review of pediatric transplant policies amid the higher death rates for pediatric patients, but the Murnaghans say Sarah doesn't have time for that. Sarah's doctors, one of whom testified Wednesday at an emergency hearing before Baylson, believe they can perform a successful transplant on her with adult lungs. 'She definitely understands things have improved quite a bit,' the girl's aunt, Sharon Ruddock, said after the ruling. The Murnaghans' attorney, Steve Harvey, said a committee of the organization that sets transplants policy may meet next week and he hoped it would change the policy. 'I hope that they decide to discontinue it completely for children under 12. I won't be satisfied until Sarah Murnaghan receives a set of lungs,' he said. 'The risk of her dying until she gets those lungs is high.' Joel Newman, spokesman for the United Network for Organ Sharing that operates the nation's transplant network, said he was unaware of any previous court order that overruled a transplant policy. 'Incredibly agonizing': U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told a congressional panel on Tuesday that she wouldn't overrule federal regulations to help save young Janet . Sisterly: Despite her poor prognosis, Sarah remains upbeat about her chances of getting a transplant . Fears: Janet and Fran Murnaghan are now hopeful their daughter's life will be saved after she was placed on the adult transplant list . While many more adult lungs than children's lungs wind up being donated, the ruling doesn't guarantee Sarah a new set of lungs. The matches are based on blood type, the risk of dying, the chance of surviving a transplant and other medical factors. The donor lungs would also have to be an appropriate size for her chest. Newman said some lungs donated from deceased adults have been offered for children's transplants over the past two years, although he couldn't give a number. But he said all were turned down by the children's surgeons. The UNOS system was established to avoid bias in determining who gets organs, thus ensuring that the rich or celebrities, for example, don't have a better chance, Caplan noted. He said it is transparent, with policies open to public comment and scrutiny before they're enacted. 'When a judge steps in and says, 'I don't like these rules, I think they're arbitrary,' they better be very arbitrary or he's undermining the authority of the whole system. Why wouldn't anybody sue?'","The national organ transplant network has complied with a judge's unusual order and placed Sarah Murnaghan, 10, on the adult waiting list .

A woman who started a fire which killed five members of the same family – including three children under five – was facing life in jail last night after being convicted of murder. Melanie Smith, 43, set fire to a baby’s pushchair because she was fed up with it being outside her front door. But the blaze spread into a devastating inferno which ripped through the first-floor flat in Prestatyn, North Wales, last October. It trapped and killed Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, her partner Liam Timbrell, 23, their baby son Charlie, 15 months, Miss Shiers’s nephew Bailey, four, and niece Skye, two. Jobless Smith, who lived in the flat below, was yesterday convicted by a 10-2 majority of five counts of murder, making her one of the most prolific murderesses in modern British history. She will be sentenced next month. Her ex-husband, Paul Smith, said the killer ‘deserves to rot in hell’. Smith collapsed in tears at Mold Crown Court after the jury returned their verdicts. She sobbed ‘Oh my God, no’ when the first verdict of murder was returned. The victims’ relatives in the packed public gallery gasped ‘Yes!’ when the foreman announced the verdicts. The jury was told that as the fire took hold, Mr Timbrell was heard in the background of a 999 call screaming: ‘Oh my God, oh my God, we’re going to die.’ Despite being badly burned, Mr Timbrell managed to tell police that he heard  Smith shouting through the letterbox: ‘I’m going to burn your house down.’ After the case, Lee-Anna’s parents Joy, 45, and Peter, 64, told of their relief. Mrs Shiers said: ‘I am overjoyed. 'I am sorry for her  family because we have always got on well with them. All our family are so happy at the verdicts.’ Blaze victims: Liam Timbrell, right, with Lee-Anna Shiers and their baby Charlie shortly after his birth . Young love: Ms Shiers' described the couple as 'heroes' would would have done anything to save the children . Her husband added: ‘Nothing will bring . them back but we have at least seen justice served. There is a big hole . in our lives and how do we fill that hole? It is just impossible.’ The Daily Mail can reveal that Smith had a history of cruelty to her own children. She stubbed cigarettes out on her . baby son’s forehead, hacked off her toddler daughter’s blonde hair, . scalded her with boiling water and locked her in an understairs cupboard . as punishment. Tragic: Skye Allen, two, and her brother Bailey , four, who were killed in the fire in the first-floor flat in . Prestatyn . Deaths: Ms Shiers, left, and her 15-month-old son Charlie were both killed following the blaze set by Smith . One of Melanie Smith's victims made a harrowing 999 call from the burning building and was heard shouting: 'Oh my God, oh my God, we're going to die.' The jury in her murder trial heard a recording of Liam Timbrell's call to emergency services, in which he said: 'Help, help. Someone has put it on purpose. We're inside the flat.' Mr Timbrell, the only person from inside the flat who could give an account of the fire, later told rescuing paramedics that 'it was arson' and 'it was Mel from downstairs'. He was very badly burned but became alert and awake, and said: 'Babies, are the babies okay?' He then added: 'I heard a woman shouting in the street.' Asked by the paramedics what he meant, he replied: '""I'm going to set fire to the house"" - yes, yes I heard this woman shouting she was going to set fire to the house.' Mr Timbrell repeatedly said 'Mel did it,' and told a police community support officer: 'She was shouting through the letterbox, ""I'm going to burn your house down.""' Asked if he recognised the voice, Mr Timbrell said 'Yes', adding: 'It was Mel from the downstairs flat.' Mr Smith, 51, said she inflicted . terrible cruelty on the three children they had together, before . abandoning them aged three, two and nine months. He said: ‘She destroyed my family . years ago, and by setting fire to that house she’s ruined the lives of . so many other people. 'The sentence is totally deserved and none of us . ever want to see her again. ‘She was an appalling mother to her . own children, and now she’s done this to these other kids. 'It’s . horrific. That evil woman deserves to rot in hell.’ Born in the seaside town of Prestatyn, Smith was 17 when she married Mr Smith. Over the next few years they had three children. Mr Smith said his ex-wife resented being tied down to three young children and regularly mistreated them. One of Smith’s daughters, Charlotte, . now 23 and a mother of one, said: ‘It shocked me to know what she’d . done, but it’s not out of character. 'She was cruel to us as kids, so why . shouldn’t she be cruel to other kids years later? ‘She was a mother from hell to me – . and she still is. Spending the rest of her life in prison won’t come . close to what she deserves.’ Mr Smith added: ‘I shudder when I . think that Melanie will probably spend the rest of her days in prison, . but she’s brought it on herself. ‘She’ll go down in history as a  notorious killer.’ Innocent: Bailey and Skye were staying with their aunt, Ms Shiers, at the time of the killing . Relief: The children's parents celebrated after the guilty verdict was delivered today . Self-confessed alcohol 'binger' Melanie Smith had a 'propensity' to make drunken threats to burn . people's houses down 'with their children inside'. Mold Crown Court was told of numerous . occasions when Smith threatened to set fire to property and how in the . six weeks before the fire she stepped up her campaign of threats against . Lee-Anna Shiers. In late 2007, Smith was barred from the Victoria Hotel in Prestatyn for being 'loud and argumentative', the court was told. In April 2008 Smith and her boyfriend Steven Clarkson were again refused service at the pub by the landlady. Smith's response was to say: 'I'm going to f****** torch this place', and to storm out of the door in a temper, the court heard. Threats: Smith, pictured outside court last week, repeatedly said she wanted to burn down people's houses . The court heard Smith 'hated' Samantha Schofield, whom she claimed had been having an affair with Clarkson. In August 2012 Smith 'trashed' Mr Clarkson's car while it was parked outside Ms Schofield's house. The windscreen wipers were bent back, the wing mirrors kicked out of position and pink milkshake thrown at the windscreen. Around 20 matches were also strewn . around the road outside Ms Schofield's house and a matchbox was found . beneath Mr Clarkson's car. Smith then had two conversations with Ms Schofield's sister, Amy, in which she said she was 'going to set fire to Sam's house'. Smith said that she had nearly set fire to the house but was 'too drunk to ignite the matches'. When it was pointed out to her that . Ms Schofield had children living with her who 'had done nothing wrong', . Smith replied: 'I'm not finished with Sammy yet and I can't make any . promises.' Fire: The smoke-damaged property in Prestatyn after the blaze which killed five people last year . On September 1 2012, Smith told Ms Shiers's friend Stacey Brady that she was going to 'make Lee-Anna's life hell'. The court heard Smith was 'ranting' about her throwing cigarette butts and shouted up at Ms Shiers: 'I am . going to set your house on fire with you and your kids in it.' On September 5 Ms Shiers' brother, . Michael, called to see his sister and she told him that when the . defendant was drunk she made threats to burn her house down, saying: 'I . have threatened to burn someone else's house down and I will do the same . to you.' The manager of the Vegas Bar in Rhyl, . Yvette Giblin, told police that on October 13 she heard the defendant . rowing with Clarkson. She claims Smith said in a raised . voice: 'You're shagging the woman upstairs. I will burn the house down . with her and the kids in it.' On October 18 2012, Smith told her . friend Pamela Handley she was going to 'torch or bomb' her landlord's . flat and that he was not going to get any money from her rent. On the morning of October 19, Smith . went to Chantelle's hair salon where hairdresser Sophie Griffiths . noticed she smelled of alcohol and was complaining about her flat. She said it was too small and that . she did not like her neighbours or landlord, adding: 'To be honest, I . wish they'd burn it to the ground because the council would have to put . me up then.'","Melanie Smith set fire at neighbours' home after long-running argument .

Sexual assaults in India have been increasing for many years, but the fatal gang rape of a woman on a New Delhi bus has pushed the issue to the top of the national agenda. The brutal attack sparked outrage about the treatment of women in the country and has made females more aware of the danger they face. Sexual crimes against women and children are reported every day in Indian newspapers, and women often complain about feeling insecure when they leave their homes. Since the bus gang-rape incident dozens of rapes cases in India - against both Indian women and tourists have been highlighted. Clashes: Police have been criticised for using heavy handed tactics against demonstrators who are demanding better protection of women following the brutal bus gang rape . The attack forced India to confront the reality that sexually-assaulted women are often blamed for the crime, forcing them to keep quiet and discouraging them from reporting it to authorities for fear of exposing their families to ridicule. Activists say passing new, strong laws is not enough, and that the government must ensure that police and the justice system crack down on crimes against women. Women face daily harassment across India, ranging from catcalls on the streets, groping and touching in public transport, to rape. Government data show the number of reported rape cases in the country rose by nearly 17 percent between 2007 and 2011. Rape victims rarely press charges because of social stigma and fear they will be accused of inviting the attack. Many women say they structure their lives around protecting themselves and their daughters from attack.","Child was found unconscious by her parents on April 18 .

The so-called Chili Finger Lady was arrested in October after she . told police that her son had been shot in the ankle by two men. The infamous 'chili finger lady' Anna Ayala (left) made up a story to protect her son Junior Reyes (right) who was found with a gunshot wound despite not being allowed to own a gun due to being on parole . Her son, Guadalupe Reyes, . accidentally shot himself with a gun he wasn't supposed to have, because . he was on parole for a felony burglary conviction. Ayala lied to prevent . him from going to prison as a felon in possession of a firearm. Reyes . will also receive two years in prison for that very charge.

The bizarre scam gathered . worldwide attention after Ayala dropped the 1 1/2 inch section of ring . finger in her bowl of fast-food chili. Bizarre hoax: Anna Ayala and her husband, Jaime Plascencia, were jailed in 2005 after cooking up a scheme to plant a severed finger in a bowl of Wendy's chili to extort money from the fast food chain . It was revealed Ayala's husband, Jaime Plascencia, had bought the digit for $100 from a co-worker who lost it in an accident. He then took it home where Ayala cooked it before depositing it in her meal on March 24, 2005. Wendy's claimed they lost $21 million in business because of the bogus allegations. In her most recent allegations, the mom said one of the attackers . wore a black Oakland A's cap and Air Jordan sneakers, while his . accomplice was a big man with a goatee and abnormally large ears who . rode a black bicycle. Ayala even gave a name for the . supposed attacker. But when authorities found a match for the supposed . suspect, they quickly ruled the man out of the accusations. 'I don't know if it was someone she . knew who she described or how she came up with the description,' said . Santa Clara County prosecutor Bret Wasley. When officers went back to question . mother and son, Wasley said that 'She backed off from her statements' while 'Junior changed his story into something unbelievable about him . chasing after a dog.' On her Facebook page 'about' section Ayala describes herself as 'Crazzzzzyyyyy and a very good chili cook... (finger lady )' San Jose police Detective Nathaniel Braxton then confronted Reyes with the theory that the pair had made up the whole story as he wasn't supposed to even own a gun. 'I told Reyes that shooting yourself in the foot is not a crime, it's an accident, but making a false report is a crime,' reports the Mercury News. 'Yea,' said Reyes, according to the report. 'I shot myself.' But when Braxton asked his mother about the new information she told him: 'I don't know nothing.' Braxton said that he 'reminded Ayala that she went to prison for doing the same thing before' and asked her where the gun was. She replied 'There's no gun no more, . it's done, thrown away' before telling police she had returned the . firearm to an unidentified friend. 'Ayala's statement confirms Reyes shot himself and she admitted to getting rid of the evidence,' reads the report. According to the detective's report, 'Ayala's final statement was, 'I'm not going back to prison for something that has nothing to do with me.' Ayala appeared contrite after her release from prison, telling CBS that she had faced ridicule in jail for her part in the scam and that 'I learned my lesson and I just want to move on with my life.' The 'chili finger lady' was convicted in 2005 and released for good behavior in 2009 . In 2005, the Associated Press revealed that even before the chili finger episode, Ayala had been involved in at least half a dozen legal battles in the San Francisco Bay area. She brought a suit against an ex-boss in 1998 for sexual harassment and sued an auto dealership in 2000, alleging the wheel fell off her car. That suit was dismissed after Ayala fired her lawyer, who said she had threatened him. The case against her former employer was settled in arbitration in June 2002, but it was not known whether she received any money. Ayala acknowledged, however, that her family received a settlement for their medical expenses about a year ago after reporting that her daughter, Genesis, got sick from food at an El Pollo Loco restaurant in Las Vegas. She declined to provide any further details.","Anna Ayala, 47, made up evidence to protect son who 'shot himself in foot' despite being banned from owning a gun .

Six out of ten people are worried about spiralling energy bills, far eclipsing the number concerned about climate change. Despite ministers’ efforts to convince the public of the need for costly ‘green’ energy projects, just one person in 20 said climate change was Britain’s biggest challenge. When asked to rate the relative importance of ten issues, climate change was picked by just 5 per cent of those asked in the Government survey. The quarterly survey by the Department for Energy and Climate reveals growing anxiety about energy bills in the last year . Gas and electricity bills are more than 7 per cent higher than a year ago, but the government claimed that the public was most concerned about climate change . Unemployment was top of the list, at . 37 per cent, followed by the NHS, inflation and rising prices, law and . order, education, tax, energy supply, climate change and national . security. Only 17 per cent put climate change in their top three . challenges, according to interviews with 2,500 people by the Department . for Energy and Climate Change. Rising energy bills, however, were . very much on people’s minds, with 23 per cent saying they were ‘very . concerned’ and another 37 per cent ‘fairly concerned’, higher than in . the previous four surveys. Some 43 per cent believed energy . prices had risen more than shopping or transport costs, despite a rise . in numbers of those who had switched suppliers to get a better deal. The survey revealed only five per cent of people thought climate change was the top challenge facing the UK . More people were aware of ‘collective . switching’ – in which people club together to obtain a better deal – . but two-thirds were ‘not interested’ in it. Energy Secretary Ed Davey said it 'comes as no surprise' that people are worried about bills . Despite the figures, Energy Secretary . Ed Davey said: ‘The findings show energy and  climate change issues are . at the forefront of people’s minds. ‘It comes as no surprise that energy . bills are a concern, but the increase in collective switching awareness, . as more and more people club together to increase their energy buying . power, is encouraging.’ He said it also showed ‘clear public . support for the Government to continue in its efforts of developing for . low-carbon, home-grown forms of energy’. The number of people who said they supported renewable energy rose to 82 per cent, 3 per cent up on a year ago. Solar panels were one of the most popular and onshore wind power one of the least. Last year, all of the Big Six energy . firms introduced inflation-busting rises of up to 11 per cent, raising . the average dual fuel bill to over £1,300.

The pensioner is one of 11 people arrested so far under Operation Yewtree – the Met’s investigation into alleged offending by the former disc jockey and others. A Scotland Yard spokesman said last night that the man, who has not been named, was interviewed under caution on November 29 last year, five days after a search warrant was executed at an address in Berkshire. The 82-year-old's arrest is the 11th so far under Operation Yewtree - the Met's investigation into former disc jockey Jimmy Savile . He has been given police bail until May. Earlier this week the Mail revealed that as few as three of the men arrested by Scotland Yard over suspected sex offences in the Savile case are likely to be charged. Details of the small number of Yewtree prosecutions emerged a day after a former BBC producer was released without charge following his arrest over an alleged sex assault in 1965. Wilfred De’ath, 75, who spent four months on bail before being cleared, accused police of being ‘over-zealous’ because they had failed ‘lamentably’ to stop Savile’s reign of terror while he was still alive. Amid claims of a celebrity witch-hunt, there has been growing speculation that Freddie Starr could soon be told that he, too, will not be charged.

A woman called Karin Ward claimed Starr had had a ‘very bad attack of wandering hands’ with her nearly 40 year ago. He vehemently denied her claims. Last month a Metropolitan Police report said Savile had abused adults and children across the country over more than five decades.

Ministry of Justice figures show a 700 per cent rise in High Court inheritance actions in five years. Experts linked the surge to the recession, which has left relatives inheriting less than they expected. As a result, families are left ‘fighting over the scraps’. Lawyers also cited  social changes such as family breakdown. Remarriage and the growth in second families mean there are more potential inheritors.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 06:56 EST, 8 November 2011 . The Border Agency is accused of a massive cover-up to hide the number of people let in to the country under a secret relaxation of immigration controls this summer. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said in the House of Commons that 'the shredders are on and there is a ban on internal emails,' as she urged Theresa May to investigate attempts to conceal the scale of the fiasco. Her claims came as the Home Secretary admitted that we will never know how many terrorists and criminals entered Britain in the latest borders blunder. Attack: Labour's Yvette Cooper, left, yesterday criticised Theresa May, . right, for her part in allowing immigrants to enter Britain unchecked . Mrs May made the admission yesterday as she explained to MPs her role in the relaxation of controls. The Home Secretary said she ordered a ‘pilot’ scheme to water down passport checks in July for Britons and other EU nationals – without telling Parliament. Up to five million foreign nationals may have entered the UK during the downgrade, which applied at every port and airport. It will never be known how many were illegals. Senior Home Office sources conceded Mrs May agreed to extend the pilot scheme in September – even though she did not know whether it was working properly. As the Home Secretary prepares to face the Home Affairs Select Committee today, one of the committee's members has criticised her 'shambolic' handling of the affair. Labour MP Alun Michael, a former Home Office minister, said: 'She didn't answer some very straight questions in the House yesterday.' Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning, he added: 'The Home Secretary knew of the deep concern about the Border Agency, and yet there doesn't seem to have been a link between ministers and the chief people, particularly in the border force.' Suspended: Brodie Clark, the head of the UK Borders Agency, has had the blame for the fiasco placed squarely at his door by Mrs May . Last night a . damaging leaked document also revealed that the rule change was brought . in to cut queues at airports, not for security reasons. Home Office . sources also admitted Mrs May was kept informed about the original . scheme. The scandal is hugely embarrassing . for the Tories, who campaigned at the election on a platform of reducing . immigration to ‘tens of thousands’ a year, after it soared to more than . a quarter of a million under Labour. UK . Border Agency boss Brodie Clark was suspended on Thursday after Mrs . May was told a separate round of additional checks on foreigners from . outside the EU against a ‘watch list’ had also been suspended at Calais . as well as some Heathrow fingerprint checks. But . last night the Public and Commercial Services Union – which represents . hundreds of Border Agency officials – claimed the fingerprint checks . were actually scrapped months before the pilot scheme was introduced. Mrs May’s critics, however, have still to produce ‘smoking gun’ evidence that she knew of Mr Clark’s decision to further water down the checks last summer. Yesterday Labour disclosed an email – circulated on July 28 – which ordered UKBA staff to ‘cease routinely opening the chip’ in biometric passports from the EU. Downgraded: An extraordinary document says that staff were told to downgrade the checks to ensure there were no hold ups at airports . Officials were also told to stop ‘routinely checking’ children from the EU ‘against the Warnings Index’, which is designed to weed out possible terrorists and criminal gangs. And staff were told to not routinely question visa holders from outside the EU on arrival in the UK either – though Home Office officials said this was standard practice. The Daily Mail first reported on the fiasco in Saturday's edition . Crucially, the document also gave the . green light for the border staff to take ‘further measures’ without . clearing them with ministers. Extraordinarily, . the document makes clear that the downgrade in checks was carried out . to ‘ensure good order in the arrival hall, disruption to flight . schedules’ and prevent ‘passengers being held on the aircraft’. That . revelation is particularly damaging for ministers as union chiefs say . the changes were made because ministers are laying off 5,200 staff as . part of cut-backs and there aren’t enough staff to handle the volume of . passengers at peak times. Announcing . no fewer than three inquiries into the fiasco, the Home Secretary . insisted the measures were authorised on the basis that they were . subject to a ‘risk-based assessment’ and not used routinely. But . that claim was in tatters as Border Agency whistleblowers said . passport controls were relaxed for half of working shifts at most ports . of entry and ‘almost round the clock’ at some airports like Luton and . Stansted. Mrs May placed . the blame squarely at the door of Brodie Clark, telling MPs he . ‘authorised the wider relaxation of border controls without ministerial . sanction’. The UKBA was at the . centre of another controversy this summer when it emerged officials . missed six chances to stop a banned Palestinian activist from entering . the UK. Mrs May said an . investigation into how Sheikh Raed Salah was able to enter the UK in . June despite being banned found 'insufficiently robust processes' led to . six missed chances to intervene overseas, on departure to, and in the . UK. ‘Indeed I told officials explicitly that the pilot was to go no further than we had agreed,’ she said. ‘As a result of these unauthorised . actions, we will never know how many people entered the country who . should have been prevented from doing so after being flagged by the . Warnings Index.’ Around 100,000 foreign nationals . enter Britain every day. If the rules were relaxed for half of all . shifts, it is likely that up to five million foreign nationals entered . the UK while the weaker rules were in operation. A . briefing note circulated by Tory whips yesterday urged Conservative MPs . to ask the Home Secretary whether those responsible should be . prosecuted – effectively agitating for Mr Clark to be charged. UKBA sources, unions and opposition politicians said it was inconceivable that the Home Office did not know what was going on. Home Office officials admitted Mrs May did receive an update on the operation of the scheme when she signed off a decision to extend it from mid-September to November. Aides said she would not have seen the ‘operational instruction’ from Border Agency bosses to frontline staff at ports of entry. Mrs May was supported by David Cameron, but Downing Street made clear he was only informed about the pilot scheme in recent days ‘when it was apparent that there was a problem’. Ms Cooper accused Mrs May of ‘doing nothing, even now, to find out and assess who has entered the country and what the security risk might be’. She added: 'We need to know what pressures officials were put under to cut corners as a result and keep queues down with reduced staff.'","Theresa May admits she ordered 'pilot' scheme .

Missing: Rembrandt's Lieven Willemsz, van Coppenol, Writing-Master etching which a Norwegian gallery bought a copy of for $8,500 only for it to be lost in the post . They wanted to save money on courier and insurance costs of it coming from the UK - and chose for it to be delivered in the post. But everything did not go to plan. And as days past by without the work arriving through the letter box it became clear that the virtually irreplaceable had been lost. 'Using a courier or special insurance is quite expensive so we have used regular mail until now,' Ole Derje, the gallery's chairman said. 'It is worth around 40,000 to 50,000 crowns ($6,900-$8,600) and the postal service is offering us compensation of 500-1,000 crowns.' Derje said his gallery, which is displaying works by Dürer, Rembrandt, Goya, Munch and Dali, received notice to pick up the package but when he went to collect it, it was nowhere to be found. Derje declined to name the seller, citing confidentiality concerns. The Soli Brug Gallery in Greaaker near Oslo, that refused to pay for couriers for the rare Rembrandt is bought from Britain. It was then lost in the post . 'We are sorry that this has happened; . we have advised him to use a more appropriate form of mail when sending . items that are worth as much as this with the appropriate insurance . connected,' said Hilde . Rembrandt was a dutch painter and etcher who is considered to be one of the greatest painters in European art. His works include the The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, 1633, and The Abduction of Europa, 1632. The Dutch artists Night Watch is valued at a staggering $305,000,000. While in 2009, his 'Portrait of a Man' sold for $36m at Christies in London. Master: An early self-portrait of Rembrandt and right, a later portrait of the great Dutch master . If the lost etching was stolen in the . post, it will join a register of missing pieces of work that stands at . an incredible £1bn, according according to the Art Loss Register. The organisation claims that there are 350,000 stolen works of art in the world. It is not clear what would happen to the picture if somebody found it in the post but it would be hard for them to sell it legally without attracting the attention of the authorities.

Victims: Commuters lie on the ground outside Tokyo's Tsukiji subway station after the sarin nerve gas attack . The attacks, with pictures of bodies lying across platforms and soldiers in gas masks sealing off subway stations, shattered the country's self-image as a haven of public safety. Hirata was arrested immediately after he turned himself in on suspicion of involvement in the abduction of a notary office clerk in Tokyo in 1995, the Kyodo new agency said. Police also suspect Hirata, who joined the cult in about 1987, may have been involved in the 1995 shooting of the chief of the National Police Agency.

If they have deep enough pockets they could land themselves Britain's most expensive Tudor mansion - which has just gone on sale for a cool £9.5m. Grade II listed Isfield House near Lewes, East Sussex, boasts its own billiards room, gun and rod room and swimming pool. Being just 55 miles south of London it would seem to make an ideal retreat for wealthy businessman and city financiers. Isfield Place started life as a motte and bailey castle under Henry VIII but is now the most expensive Tudor mansion in Britain on sale at £9.5m . The idyllic gardens to the rear of the mansion, which are immaculately trimmed by a dedicated team of gardeners and would make for a perfect summer evening party . Blue skies dotted with clouds create an idyllic scene over the mansion, just like they would have hundreds of years ago when it was first built . The River Ouse even runs through part of the eight-bedroom 16th century property's estate - ideal for anglers who would enjoy a spot of weekend fishing. The property has always been privately owned since being a motte and bailey castle under the reign of Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I. Since then it has survived a civil war, an industrial revolution and two world wars. Despite the age, the mansion is as impressive today as it would have been 500 years ago. The oak beams across the roof of the living room give a clue to the heritage of the building, as does the brick fire place, which could warm the new owners in the winter . Plush: The oak-panelled dining room could provide a magical setting for many dinner parties, served up by a team of cooks . A spokesperson for estate agents . Savilles, who are handling the sale, said: 'The first record of the . settlement is a motte and bailey castle site, believed to have been . owned by the De La Warr family. 'From the early to mid 16th it underwent a transformation by the Shurley family. 'A new mansion was designed to accommodate guests of the Shurley family, who included Royal household officials.' Warm: A log fire rages in another of the mansion's main rooms, which has plenty of room for sofas and arm chairs for the whole family to gather round in . Every chef's dream: The granite surfaces and 'island' in this very modern kitchen could be used by a keen cook to prepare luxury meals . Library: A solitary book case currently lies in this reception in the £9.5m mansion, but it could be easily be transformed into a library . Comfortable: The master bedroom in the country mansion 55 miles south of London has its own fireplace.. and views over the estate's 311 acres of land . Other features include a tennis court, reception room and drawing room. Two cottages and one flat are included in the estate, as well as several more outbuildings. The 311 acres of land within the grounds include woodland, arable and pasture. This patio swimming pool is plenty big enough to stretch the arms and legs before enjoying the rolling views across the countryside . Properties: This is one of two cottages in the grounds of the mansion. It could be used to guests and family members . A second cottage has had various uses over the years, including as a store room for gardeners tasked with keeping the sprawling meadows and pastures looking fine . One for grandmother? This addition to the main building could make the ideal 'granny flat' for elderly relatives... or even a place for grown up children to stay . A magnificent oak-panelled dining room could provide the setting for many fine dinner parties, while the kitchen is big enough to accommodate a team of chefs and waiters to serve. While to burn off all those calories there is a goo-sized patio swimming pool with breath-taking views of the immaculately-trimmed front gardens. In the evenings, the future owners will no doubt enjoy doing what generations before them have, and relax in the wood-floored living room with the heat of the roaring log fire set in a brick fire place keeping them warm. Noble: Anyone who splashes out £9.5m on the mansion will surely have enough to pay for the upkeep of a few fine horses in the mansion's stables . Tranquil: The River Ouse even runs through part of the eight-bedroom 16th century property's estate - ideal for anglers who would enjoy a spot of weekend fishing . The mansion has 311 acres of land, including pastures, arable and even woodland - plenty of room for a long walk or canter on the horses from the stables . There are stables close to the main building - and plenty of room in which to gallop steeds across the rolling fields within the grounds of the estate. The spokesman added: 'The house, which is set in the heart of its own land, dates back to the early 16th century and provides a wonderful core to this historic estate. 'The eight-bedroom manor house, which has been the subject of refurbishment and improvements, is surrounded by outstanding formal gardens and supported by modern and traditional farm buildings, two cottages and a staff flat. 'Accessed via a long gated drive and protected by its own land with no public rights of way near the house and gardens, it commands magnificent unspoilt views south towards the Downs.'","Started life as a motte and bailey castle in the 16th century under Henry VIII .

But, according to his girlfriend Carina Trimingham who visited him in Wandsworth jail yesterday, the former Cabinet minister is ‘absolutely fine and in good spirits’. That may have something to do with the fact that they were able to spend two and a half hours sitting hand-in-hand, laughing and joking, according to witnesses. Scroll down for video . Saying hello: Carina Trimingham visited Chris Huhne at Wandsworth Prison . Driving away: Carina Trimingham managed to get a penalty notice outside Wandsworth Prison in south-west London today after parking her Toyota in a residents' parking bay while visiting Chris Huhne . On leaving the prison in South West . London, Miss Trimingham said claims that the 58-year-old . multi-millionaire was ridiculed and bullied on his first day inside were . ‘utter nonsense’. Miss Trimingham said: ‘He is getting on well both with inmates and officers.’ The former Energy Secretary and his . ex-wife Vicky Pryce, 60, were each jailed for eight months on Monday for . perverting the course of justice after swapping speeding points 10 . years ago. Ironically, Miss Trimingham’s visit was beset by a motoring offence. After driving from the couple’s . £1.25m flat in Clerkenwell, central London, she left their eco-friendly . Toyota Prius in a residents’ parking bay ... and returned later to find a . penalty ticket on the windscreen.

Dubious honour: Huhne is the first former Cabinet minister since Jonathan Aitken to be jailed . Miss Trimingham denied claims her partner has been mocked and bullied in jail. ‘There’s not a grain of truth in it,’ she said. Vicky Pryce is 'actively considering' launching an appeal against her conviction, her lawyer said today. Robert Brown said the case 'may be subject to appeal' and he would review transcripts of evidence given in court. But he questioned whether Ms Pryce should have been charged with perverting the course of justice at all. 'More careful consideration could have been given to whether or not she should have been tried or whether she should have been treated as a potential victim or a potential witness,' he told BBC Radio 4. Ms Pryce was sentenced to eight months in prison for her role in taking three penalty points for ex-husband Chris Huhne. Asked if she would launch an appeal, he added: 'That is something we will actively consider.' The 46-year-old said she had asked . the former Liberal Democrat MP about the rumours and he had told her: ‘I . can’t believe it, nothing could be further from the truth.’ Miss Trimingham said her partner had . been moved to the regular wing of the prison on Tuesday and is passing . the time by reading, mainly novels. She said: ‘The first night you are . all watched for your first night and then you get moved, if you’re OK, . to the regular wing. That’s where he is going to stay. He has got no . desire to move to another wing. ‘He has not been bullied or ridiculed by any prisoners or officers and no-one has asked him for any money.’ Meanwhile, Pryce has been moved to a . dormitory at Holloway Prison which she must share with three other . women, a former inmate claimed. The 27-year-old, who was freed . yesterday, said there had been an ‘excited buzz’ among prisoners when . they learned Huhne’s ex-wife was on her way there. She said: ‘If she keeps her head down she’ll be fine. As far as I know, no one’s threatened her or anything.’ Yesterday it emerged that the .

Named: One of the alleged abusers was named as violin teacher Chris Ling, photographed in California where he moved after a police investigation in 1991 . Two more former staff at the music school attended by abuse victim Frances Andrade were facing a police probe last night. The mother of four killed herself following a cross-examination by the barrister for Michael Brewer, a teacher who assaulted her at Chetham’s. Three more women have told police they were sexually abused as pupils at the Manchester school. One of the alleged abusers was named as violin teacher Chris Ling, who moved to California after a police investigation in 1991. Police have been given details of at least six women who claim that – when they were 15 or younger – Mr Ling would make them play their instrument naked, smack their bare bottoms to punish them, and buy them lingerie. At least one of the former Chetham’s students who has directly contacted police is understood to have made allegations against a third teacher, in addition to Brewer and Mr Ling. Brewer, who spent nearly 20 years as director of music at Chetham’s – and his ex-wife Kay, both 68 – were last week convicted of indecently assaulting Mrs Andrade while she was studying at the exclusive school. The jury were not informed until after returning their verdicts that the 48-year-old had taken a fatal overdose part way through the trial. Her family say she was traumatised by a gruelling cross-examination in which she was branded a liar and a fantasist. They want Brewer to be stripped of his OBE. He and his wife are awaiting sentence. Mr Ling, 55, is understood to have joined Chetham’s as a violin teacher in the early 1980s where his close relationship with his pupils reportedly saw Brewer refer to the girls as ‘Ling’s Strings’. He is married to a former pupil, Pippa Clarke, who is a concert violinist. But according to Press reports in 1991, Mr Ling faced a five-month police probe into allegations of sexual abuse of girls aged 16 at Chetham’s. No action is understood to have been taken, although neither the Crown Prosecution Service nor Greater Manchester Police have traced files on what happened. Mr Ling had by then moved to the US . where he now lives in a £1.6million home in an exclusive area of Sherman . Oaks in Los Angeles. He works as a classical music agent. Assault: Michael Brewer - who spent nearly 20 years as director of music at Chetham's - and his ex-wife Kay were convicted of indecently assulating Francis Andrade while she was studying at the exclusive school . At the weekend he told a reporter he had no comment to make on the allegations. Asked about the claims as she walked her . dog near their home last night, Mr Ling’s wife said: ‘There’s no . comment being made at the moment.’ Victim: Mother-of-four Frances Andrade killed herself following a cross-examination by the barrister for Brewer, who assaulted her at Chetham's . Yesterday Chief Superintendent Russ Jackson, of Greater Manchester Police, said his officers had been given a list of potential victims by the Guardian newspaper following their own investigation. He added: ‘In addition to this, several people have also come forward directly to police. ‘We will be affording them, and anyone else who comes forward, all the appropriate time and support.’ Chetham’s school has stressed it has put strict child protection measures in place. The police handling of the Brewer case could deter rape victims from coming forward,  Theresa May said last night. The . Home Secretary promised to see if any lessons could be learned from the . tragedy, which has sparked widespread alarm at Westminster. ‘This whole . question of how the police deal with rape cases is one that is being . looked at,’ she added. ‘We all recognise that one of the issues here is . the difficulty victims feel in coming forward.’ Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper . said Mrs Andrade was ‘let down by the criminal justice system whose job . it was to help and protect her’. Academics have called for an inquiry into claims that sexual abuse was rife at leading music schools in the 1970s and 80s.

The affidavit includes text messages . in which Cable tells her boyfriend that she tried pushing Dube off her, . but he wouldn't stop and ended up leaving a bite mark on her. Kyle Dube, 20, of Orono, Maine, seen here in June last year,  was charged last month with murdering . Nichole Cable, right, who was last seen on May 12, 2013 . Disastrous plot: Kyle Dube, pictured in court this week, used a Facebook account to lure Nichole Cable from her home and kidnap her. He planned to stage a rescue so he could look like a hero . Kyle Dube was indicted last week on . charges of murder and kidnapping in the death of 15-year-old Nichole . Cable, whose body was found in a wooded area of Old Town this month a . week after she went missing. In . an affidavit released after Dube was indicted, Detective Thomas . Pickering outlined the scenario leading to the high school sophomore's . death. He wrote that . Dube told his brother that he used Facebook to trick her into going out . of her house in Glenburn, not far from Old Town, while he waited in the . woods wearing a ski mask. When Nichole came along, the . 20-year-old Dube jumped out and snatched her, duct-taped her and put her . in the back of his father's pickup truck, the affidavit said. Dube . later discovered that she was dead, so he dumped her body and covered it . with branches, it said. The affidavit doesn't go into details . about how Nichole was duct-taped, and the cause of her death is still . being determined by the medical examiner's office. Dube told his brother that he . ""intended to kidnap Nichole and hide her; that he would later find her . and be the hero,"" Pickering wrote. The 'Missing' poster circulated by the authorities prior to finding Nichole's body on May 20th . Dube's attorney, Stephen Smith, did . not immediately return a phone call left at his office Wednesday . evening. He had argued for the affidavit to be withheld, citing threats . against Dube in jail, concerns about whether he could get a fair trial . and fears for the privacy of his relatives. Earlier Wednesday, Justice William . Anderson had denied a motion by The Associated Press and the Portland . Press Herald to unseal the affidavit on First Amendment grounds. The judge's original order had sealed . the affidavit only until Dube was indicted. When the indictment was . handed down, the affidavit was made public. Nichole was reported missing on May 13 . by her mother, who said she had left the night before to meet a friend . at the end of the driveway but hadn't returned. Police interviewed a friend of . Nichole's named Bryan Butterfield, who said somebody had set up a fake . Facebook account in his name and he suspected Dube. Butterfield told . detectives that Dube wanted to have sex with Nichole but that she had . rejected his advances, the affidavit said. Investigators determined that Nichole . had frequent contact with the fake Butterfield on Facebook and that the . person posing as Butterfield repeatedly requested to meet with her . before she agreed to meet with him at the end of her road to get some . marijuana the night she went missing, the affidavit said. Police asked Facebook officials to . produce records to identify the owner of the fake Butterfield account, . which was traced to Dube and his parents' home in Orono.

One laptop had been locked away in its storage drawer, but the key placed in an unlocked drawer with the other computer.

One of the laptops held the council's creditor payment history file, containing the personal information of 20,143 people, including the bank account details of 6,069 individuals. Employees had asked for these laptops to be encrypted, but the council had not done so, it was reported by the BBC.

David Cameron called his daughter Florence suggesting that he is more left wing than we might have thought . The name you choose for your baby gives away your political affiliation, new research has revealed. Conservatives tend to choose more masculine-sounding names for their children with lots of K’s and B’s. They are also fond of choosing names with lots of D’s and T’s because they sound tough. The study showed that people with more left wing views do the opposite and tend to include a lot of feminine words. These include L sounds and soft-A endings such as Sophia. The findings may give a clue into how the likes of David Cameron really think - he chose Nancy, Florence, Arthur and Ivan for his kids suggesting that he is really more liberal than conservative. Labour leader Ed Miliband has two sons, called Daniel and Samuel, who seem more in keeping with his left-of-centre political beliefs. The US researchers looked at birth records from 545,018 babies born in California in 2004, representing 52,589 different names. They then compared the names to voting returns in each neighbourhood and used these as an indication of their parents’ political inclination. The study found that ‘soft’ sounds, like the L in ‘Lola’, the A in ‘Ella’ or the Y in ‘Carly’ were more likely to be found in areas which voted on the left. Examples of this include ‘Julian’ or ‘Liam’ for a boy or a girl’s name like ‘Malia’ - one of US President Barack Obama’s daughters. Conservatives by contrast went for ‘harder’ sounds such as Track, Trig, Bristol and Piper, names chosen by the family of former vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin. True red: The names of Labour Party Leader Ed Miliband and wife Christine's children, Daniel and Samuel, are more in keeping with his centre-left views . Lead researcher Eric Oliver, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, said that the difference could be to do with perceptions of names that are linked to wealth. Traditionally masculinity has been linked to economic success, so by giving your child a more masculine name parents could in theory be hoping they will become wealthy too. Professor Oliver said: ‘The fact that we would find any kind of systematic differences, much less the magnitude of differences that we found - I really did not anticipate that. ‘I think most of this happens unconsciously...underneath there is a lot of signalling going on’. Left wing: President Barack Obama children's names Sasha and Malia indicate his left leaning . Another finding related to the kind of names that parents chose. Liberal parents are more likely to choose an obscure name to denote status whilst conservatives usually opt for something more conventional, the study showed. Left-wing mothers and fathers try to use obscure cultural references to inflate their social position and show how smart they are. What's in a name: Couples who choose more outlandish names for their children, like Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, are more likely to be left wing . This could explain why many actors and actresses, who usually have left-wing views, choose odd names for their children such as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie who count Pax and Shiloh among their brood. Conservatives by contrast tend to opt for traditional names like John, Richard, or Katherine because the elites in society have them and they want their children to be part of the club. The findings have not yet been published but were presented at the 2013 Midwestern Political Science Association Annual Meeting in Chicago.","Conservative voters tend to choose masculine sounding names .

David Cameron is facing an angry backlash from Tory MPs for failing to prevent Nick Clegg wrecking plans to cut the cost of childcare. The Deputy Prime Minister yesterday revelled in his success in blocking proposals drawn up by the Department for Education to give nurseries the option of increasing the number of toddlers they care for, as long as better qualified staff were taken on. Its analysis suggested the reforms could save parents an average £1,329 a year per child. 'They thought this was a bad idea': Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, told listeners to his weekly radio call-in show that his consultations had shown that parents and nursery staff were opposed to the proposals . But Mr Clegg told his weekly radio phone-in yesterday that the department’s analysis was wrong and that the reform could even push up costs - and also denied Tory claims that he had previously signed off the plans. Tory sources said childcare minister Elizabeth Truss - who drew up the blueprint for reform as a backbench MP -- had been told when she was appointed by the Prime Minister to go ahead and implement them in full. One senior MP said that since the reforms did not require legislation, Mr Cameron should have insisted on them going ahead anyway and was ‘spineless’ for not doing so. Another source said: ‘When the coalition started we thought the Lib Dems would have influence over policy in proportion to the number of MPs they have in the Commons. Instead it seems the balance of power at the top of the Government is something like 49 per cent Tory and 51 per cent Liberal.’ The row over childcare has plunged . coalition relations to a new low, with Tories in Downing Street accusing . Lib Dems of deciding to torpedo the plans before discussions had even . been concluded in ‘revenge’ for aggressive Tory moves this week on union . funding and wind farms. Foiled: Childcare minister Elizabeth Truss, right, had been told when she was appointed to go ahead and implement the changes in full, Tories said . But Mr Clegg told LBC radio: ‘What we said was we would consult people on this idea and then we would react to how people responded. ‘What I said very explicitly within Government is that you can only decide on this when we’ve heard the responses from people who frankly know better than any politician what it’s like to look after four, five, six two-year-old toddlers. 'The response, not just from nurseries, but overwhelmingly from parent groups was they thought this was a bad idea. They thought it was a bad idea for a number of reasons but the one I focused on was the claim initially made that it would somehow reduce the weekly childcare bill for families. I, like everyone desperately want to do whatever I can to bring childcare costs down. ‘What came back was a really clear answer that there was no real evidence that this would reduce childcare costs. In fact at one nursery after another that I visited, they said, ""To be honest Mr Clegg"", they would say to me privately, ""It might well drive costs up because we’re going to have to spend more money on more higher-qualified staff"".' From September, the ratio for under-ones had been due to rise from three per adult to four. Each adult would be able to look after six two-year-olds instead of four. But the ratio for three-year-olds was to stay at eight or 13 children per adult, depending on whether a qualified graduate was present. Earlier this week Mr Clegg met the Prime Minister to inform him that he was opposed to the plans and would be blocking them. However, he did not tell him when he would be making any announcement. Other reforms to childcare, including a generous tax break for working couples to be introduced in 2015, are still going ahead. Senior Tory minister Michael Fallon . betrayed the growing frustration in his party at being in a coalition . Government, saying ‘life would be a lot easier’ if the Conservatives . were not sharing power with the Lib Dems. Mr . Fallon, the Business and Energy Minister, said being in coalition meant . getting agreement across Whitehall was harder and the process of . government could be ‘tedious’. But . the minister, the senior Tory in two departments led by Lib Dems, did . praise the junior coalition partner for sticking to the coalition’s . commitment to getting the deficit down. Relaxation: Under the proposals one childminder would have been able to look after four babies under the age of one instead of three, and one adult would also have been able to look after six two-year-olds instead of four . In an interview with political magazine The House, Mr Fallon said: ‘Life would be a lot easier if we didn’t have the coalition. ‘The process of coalition for both sides is time consuming, bits of it can be tedious, there are an awful lot of people to be consulted, getting agreement across Whitehall is made doubly difficult by the coalition. ‘But then if we didn’t have the coalition we would be stuck with the rest of Europe, way behind on our fiscal plan. The great strength of the coalition is that it is a five-year programme which we have struck to, of getting the deficit down. ‘Fair play to the Liberal Democrats, they have never wavered in that central purpose.’","Tories sources say childcare row has sunk coalition relations to a new low .

"By . Reuters Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:43 EST, 24 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 22:44 EST, 24 May 2013 . Yahoo Inc has submitted a formal proposal to buy Hulu, joining a growing list of bidders for the video service owned by News Corp and Walt Disney Co. Yahoo just this week announced a $1.1 billion acquisition of blogging service Tumblr. Sources close to the process say the bids from Yahoo! and half a dozen other suitors value Hulu well over a billion dollars. Spending spree: With the ink barely dry on her $1.1 billion deal to purchase Tumblr, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is now making a bid for video site Hulu . If Yahoo is successful, it could be CEO Marissa Mayer’s second $1 billion deal inside a month. The company just acquired micro-blogging service Tumblr for $1.1 billion. It now joins rival bidders for Hulu, including Time Warner Cable Inc, DirecTV, former News Corp president Peter Chernin and Guggenheim Digital Media, sources have said. It is unclear how much the Internet company bid. Sources have said Chernin is bidding $500 million, excluding an additional sum to cover Hulu's debt and programming commitments. In-demand: Yahoo and pay TV operators DirecTV and Time Warner Cable are among the seven bidding for Yahoo . But a source close to the bidding told Reuters his offer was too low, that Hulu could be worth as much as $1 billion to $2 billion. Time Warner Cable's bid was fashioned as an equity investment, another person said, as the cable operator hopes to set up a joint venture with other cable companies to operate Hulu. Yahoo did not respond to requests for comment. Its shares closed up 1.2 percent at $26.33. At least five bidders have emerged for the five-year-old video service with 4 million users, potentially setting up a bidding competition. A second source close to the bidding said the offers submitted so far were non-binding and dependent on Hulu amending content licensing agreements the bidders found too restrictive. Silver Lake, a minority owner of influential Hollywood talent agency William Morris Endeavor, has also submitted an indicative letter of interest, the source familiar with the Hulu bidding said, confirming an earlier Bloomberg report. Free-spending: Hulu is reportedly valued at over $2 billion, and Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer has shown she is very willing to spend that kind of money . The private equity firm teamed up with William Morris Endeavor, which it invested in a year ago, for the bid, according to the source. Hulu, which generated revenues of around $700 million last year, streams TV shows online in similar fashion to Netflix Inc. It is being advised in the sale by Guggenheim Partners, a separately funded group from the digital media unit that placed the bid. Yahoo has gone on an acquisition spree to bring in talent as well as beef up its mobile and online products and content, as CEO Marissa Mayer tries to revive a once-dominant Internet icon that has for years bled users. Yahoo remains one of the Web's most popular destinations, but has seen its revenue shrink, as consumers and advertisers favor rivals such as Google Inc and Facebook Inc.","Hulu reportedly attracted at least seven bidders .

The U.S. emerged as the biggest growth market for luxury brands last year as the economy recovers and consumer confidence grows. Luxury spending in the U.S. collapsed after the 2008 financial crisis but roared back to pre-crisis . levels in 2012. Most men might balk at spending $600 on a . pair of Dior sneakers but for U.S. shoppers like Ephraim, an upbeat . 30-year-old, such indulgences are becoming increasingly commonplace. Ephraim is the kind of man who gives . luxury goods makers high hopes that the U.S. market can fuel future . growth, as China runs out of steam and demand in Europe sags. 'There is a cultural shift,' Ephraim . says while browsing at Saks Inc's New York City flagship. 'Men are . becoming more fashion forward.' The growing appeal of luxury . goods to men and increased confidence among affluent spenders as the . U.S. economy and asset prices recover have boosted sales and encouraged . luxury brands to step up their investments in the United States. More foreign shoppers are also thronging stores as the U.S. government eases visa restrictions to attract more tourists. Luxury spending in the United States . collapsed after the 2008 financial crisis but roared back to pre-crisis . levels by 2012. Last year, the world's No.1 and No.3 luxury groups LVMH . and PPR saw higher growth rates in the United States than in China for . the first time in years. Sales in the Americas are expected to . grow 5-7 per cent this year, compared to 6-8 percent in mainland China . and 0-2 per cent in Europe, according to consultancy Bain & Co. Each year, research consulting firm Millward Brown ranks the top luxury brands. For 2013, the top brands are: . Louis Vuitton . Hermès . Rolex . CHANEL . Gucci . Prada . Cartier . Hennessy . Moët & Chandon . Burberry . Evidence is already showing through. Ralph Lauren this week forecast U.S. sales growth of 4-7 per cent while high-end department store Saks reported quarterly sales up 5.9 per cent, almost double what analysts had forecast. '[There is] renewed confidence, a genuine rebound in fashion and luxury consumption', said Sidney Toledano, head of French fashion house Christian Dior, part of LVMH. Major brands like Prada, Hermes, Burberry, and Hugo Boss are opening shops or expanding existing ones in the United States, and are stepping up their advertising spend. In July, Alexander McQueen will open a 3,900-foot store on New York's Madison Avenue. Next year, Burberry plans to launch a new flagship on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. LVMH and PPR, soon to be renamed Kering, are also expanding in the United States while putting the brakes on China, which had been the major driver for luxury sales until last year. 'I think the U.S. holds a lot more potential than people believe while the focus has very much been on the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) countries,' said Robert Chavez, head of U.S. operations at Hermes. The French group, which opened its only shop dedicated to men on Madison Avenue in 2010, now makes about 15 per cent of its sales in the United States, up from 10 per cent five years ago. China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao account for 20 per cent. 'We have noticed a rise in men's purchases, particularly in the last two years,' said Chavez. Ties, shoes and $8,000 custom-made three-piece cashmere suits are all doing equally well. In the 212 billion euro luxury as a . whole, the United States outguns China, even before the new growth . spurt. Bain & Co. values the U.S. market at 59 billion euros, Europe . at 74.2 billion and China-Hong Kong around 22 billion. PPR . boss Francois-Henri Pinault reckons that rising numbers of tourists to . the United States will enable it to narrow the gap with Europe, where . visitors account for about half of luxury sales. That contrasts with . 15-20 per cent in the United States. 'We . will never have as many tourists as in Europe but I think that ratio . could reach 30 per cent over the next few years,' said Milton Predaza, . chief executive of Luxury Institute, a U.S. consultancy. In . 2010, 6 million tourists from Brazil, India and China flew to Western . Europe compared to 2.6 million to the United States. Travel agents say . U.S. visa approvals require more proof of employment history and . finances than for France or Italy. The . United States would earn $20 billion more from luxury sales if it had . as many tourists from emerging markets as Europe, New York-based . brokerage International Strategy & Investment Group (ISI) estimates. Coveted: The Hermes Birkin bag, seen here on the arm of Lindsay Lohan, costs about $10,000 . The U.S. State Department says it has cut the wait for a visa-related interview in Brazil, where most U.S. luxury shopping tourists come from, to two days. Clerks at Saks said they had noticed an increase in Brazilian tourists. The State Department also plans to waive interviews for some visa applicants and is expanding or building new consulates in China and Brazil. Tourism from China is expected to more than triple to 3.9 million people by 2017 from 2011. Tourism from Brazil is forecast to rise 83 per cent to 2.8 million, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. 'We have not had a major breakthrough yet. However, it is moving in the right direction,' said Omar Saad, senior managing director and head of the luxury team at ISI. The appeal of America to Brazilians is twofold - it is closer than Europe and prices are much lower than at home. A Burberry man's coat costs $3,100 in Sao Paulo against $995 at the New York flagship on 57th street. Pam Danziger, president of marketing consulting firm Unity Marketing and author of studies on the U.S. luxury industry, believes growth is also being driven by what she calls HENRYs - 'high earning, not rich yet' Americans making $100,000-$249,000 a year. She estimates about 24.2 million households are HENRYs. To capture those buyers, brands are now expanding beyond New York, which accounts for a third of U.S. luxury sales, and the next two main cities of Los Angeles and Miami. Growth: Louis Vuitton now has 460 shops in 50 countries and is set to expand its existing stores in the U.S. Last month, Hermes opened in Greenwich, Connecticut - an area popular with financial professionals and their families - and plans to expand in cities like LA, Miami, Houston, Dallas and Boston over the next two years. PPR's brands, which include Balenciaga, Gucci and Stella McCartney, are looking at Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, Orlando and Philadelphia. 'The U.S. is an emerging country when it comes to luxury,' said Boston Consulting Group senior partner Jean-Marc Bellaiche.","The market for luxury fashion in China is worth $28.4bn compared to $76.2bn in the U.S.

Coronation Street actor Bill Roache vowed to 'vigorously protest his innocence' as he arrived at court today to face new sex abuse charges. His lawyer said the actor finds the allegations 'deeply upsetting' in a statement. Roache, 81, was last night charged with sexually assaulting another four girls, one as young as 11. He was re-arrested yesterday, a month after he was charged with twice raping a schoolgirl in 1967. Speaking outside Preston Magistrate's Court, the actor's lawyer Brian Russell said that the new charges were made after fresh 'victims' came forward in the last month. 'Yesterday, Mr Roache was interviewed at length in the police station, and as you know was then charged with five offences of indecent assault,' said Mr Russell. 'These allegations arose out of the publicity which was generated when Mr Roache was interviewed on May 1 for offences of rape. 'So during two lengthy police interviews,Mr Roache has fully co-operated with all the questions that police have had for him in relation to these matters.' The lawyer added that Roache will fight the case 'vigorously'. 'We expect that later this year, or possibly early next year, a jury will be asked to consider whether Mr Roache is guilty or not guilty of those charges,' he said. 'Mr Roache looks forward to standing before that jury where he will vigorously protest his innocence against what he regards as deeply upsetting allegations made against him.' The new allegations against Roache, who has played Ken Barlow over six decades, are claimed to have happened in the Manchester area between 1965 and 1968. Roache was later bailed to appear at . Preston Crown Court on Monday, when he is due to face an earlier charge . of raping a 15-year-old girl in 1967. During . the hearing, he exchanged greetings with Lona Smith, chair of the bench . of magistrates, before he gave his full name - William Patrick Roache - . his address, date of birth and the name of his legal representative. The court clerk then proceeded to outline the details of the five fresh charges which were made yesterday. Mr Russell interrupted her to state: 'I indicate they are not guilty pleas.' The . dates of the alleged indecent assaults in the Manchester area and the . names of the four alleged victims - who cannot be named for legal . reasons - were then read out. Two . counts relate to a girl aged under 16 in 1965, one to a 16-year-old in . 1965, one to a girl aged under 16 in 1968 and one to a girl under 13 in . 1968. Contesting the charges: Lawyer Brian Russell (right) makes a statement on behalf of the veteran actor (left) outside the court today saying Roache will vigorously contest the allegations . Sex abuse charges: Coronation Street Actor Bill Roache arrives at court this morning after being charged with five offences last night . Bill Roache will 'vigorously protest his innocence' when his sex abuse case goes before a jury, his lawyer said today. Speaking outside Preston magistrates' court, Mr Russell said: 'Yesterday Mr Roache was interviewed at length at the police station and, as you know, was then charged with five offences of indecent assault. 'These allegations arose out of the publicity that was generated when Mr Roache was interviewed on May 1 for offences of rape. 'So during two lengthy police interviews Mr Roache has fully co-operated with all the questions that the police have had for him in relation to these matters. 'Today we expect those cases to be transferred to the Crown Court and there will be another appearance of a short nature on Monday. 'We expect that later this year, or possibly early next year, a jury will be asked to consider whether Mr Roache is guilty or not guilty of those charges. 'Mr Roache looks forward to standing before that jury where he will vigorously protest his innocence against what he regards as deeply upsetting allegations made against him. 'Ladies and gentlemen, I can't go into any more detail, it would be inappropriate at this stage.' Joanna White, prosecuting, said the eldest alleged victim was 16, one was 14, one was aged 13 or 14 at the time and the other was 11 or 12. She added the above matters were not suitable for summary trial before magistrates with a possible sentence of up to 18 months in prison for such an offence. Roache is one of the best-known stars to be held over child sex allegations in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal. His friend Stuart Hall, the disgraced BBC TV presenter, is due to be sentenced later this month after he admitted indecently assaulting 13 girls during the 1960s, 70s and 80s. One was aged just nine when she was molested by the It’s a Knockout host. The Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday three of the new offences allegedly committed by Roache took place in 1965 and two in 1968. Nazir Afzal, Chief Crown Prosecutor . for CPS North West, said: ‘We have carefully considered all the evidence . gathered by Lancashire Police in relation to recent allegations from . four complainants that William Roache indecently assaulted them in the . 1960s. ‘Having completed . our review, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it . is in the public interest for Mr Roache to be charged with five offences . of indecent assault relating to four girls who were aged between 11 or . 12 and 16 at the time that the alleged offences happened. ‘We . have been reviewing evidence and providing early investigative advice . to Lancashire Police regarding these allegations, which were made to . police after Mr Roache was charged with two offences of rape on 1 May . 2013.’ Roache – the world’s . longest-serving soap actor – has played Ken Barlow in the ITV1 soap . since its launch, but will not be appearing in the programme until legal . proceedings are concluded. 'Fighting the allegations': Bill Roache (left) with his lawyer Brian Russell outside Preston magistrates' court this morning. The lawyer said Roache would 'vigorously protest his innocence' after he was charged with five indecent assaults . Charged: Roache has been charged with five indecent assaults against four girls aged between 11 or 12 and 16 . Fans of the soap were stunned when . the twice-married star was taken into custody following a raid at his . home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, last month and charged with twice raping a . 15-year-old girl in 1967 when he was 35 and married to his first wife. In a statement issued by his lawyers . after he was charged with those offences, he said he 'strenuously' denies the allegations and vowed to fight 'to preserve my . innocence in the challenging times ahead'. In March, Roache issued a public . apology after he claimed in a TV interview that sex abuse victims . brought it upon themselves and were being punished for sins in a past . life. He also called for the same anonymity . for those accused of child sex offences as alleged victims are given . until conviction because of the stigma they faced even if subsequently . found innocent. Off air: Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell was charged with 19 sexual offences against a child. His charges are not connected to William Roache's charges . Fellow Coronation Street star Michael . Le Vell, who plays mechanic Kevin Webster, is also currently off air . after being charged with 19 sexual offences against a child, including . rape, indecent assault and sexual activity. He denies the charges, which . are not linked to Roache. Roache’s marriage to his first wife, Anna, ended in divorce in 1974. His second wife Sara died in 2009. Earlier this year it was revealed he . ended his two-year relationship with TV weathergirl Emma Jesson, 44, so . he could explore a ‘mystic message of love’ linked to his membership of . the Pure Love Movement, a religious group. Last month, the Mail revealed that . comedian Jim Davidson is being investigated by Yewtree officers over . claims he indecently assaulted a woman in the Falkland Islands in the . 1980s during a concert tour. The attack is alleged to have . happened while the former Generation Game host was entertaining British . troops stationed there after the Falklands conflict. Davidson, 59, was originally arrested . in January of this year over alleged sex offences in the UK. He denies . all the allegations. Other arrested celebrities include entertainer Rolf . Harris, DJ Dave Lee Travis and comedian Freddie Starr. Disgraced pop star Glitter has also been detained. They all deny any wrongdoing. PR guru Max Clifford has been charged with 11 historic counts of indecent assault against teenage girls. The 70-year-old has vowed to clear his name, labelling the allegations ‘a load of nonsense’. Critics claim the Yewtree investigation has become a celebrity witch-hunt. But Yard chiefs insist it is fair and proportionate. At least one more celebrity is expected to face criminal charges in the coming weeks. Detained: Chris Denning helped launch Gary Glitter's career . A former Radio 1 DJ has been arrested by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile scandal. Chris Denning, 72, was detained at a hostel in East London by officers working on Operation Yewtree. Scotland Yard said the suspect, whom they have not formally named, was questioned on suspicion of sexual offences. Yesterday it emerged that the arrested man was Denning and that he was quizzed over ‘historic allegations’. It is understood he is not accused of any offences with Savile, a former colleague. Denning was one of the original Radio 1 DJs alongside Tony Blackburn, Jimmy Young, Kenny Everett, Terry Wogan, Pete Murray, Ed Stewart and John Peel when the station launched in 1967.

Rutgers President Robert Barchi is facing further calls for his resignation following the latest abuse scandal at the university's athletic program. Julie Hermann, who was hired as Rutgers' athletic director on May 15, quit her job at Tennessee 16 years ago over accusations that she put her volleyball team through a storm of humiliation and fear, a scathing report has claimed. Now, prominent New Jersey politicians, including former Governor Richard Codey, have demanded that Barchi steps down. Current Governor Chris Christie is said to be considering the issue. Scroll down for video . Under the microscope: Julie Hermann, Rutgers' new athletic director, says she doesn't remember the letter that accused her of taking jabs at her former volleyball players' weight, and calling them whores and learning disabled . 'A great university with great students and alumni deserve better,' Codey said. The Star-Ledger reported on Saturday night that all 15 of the Tennessee team members said Hermann called them 'whores, alcoholics and learning disabled.' They wrote: 'It has been unanimously decided that this is an irreconcilable issue.' 'The mental cruelty that we as a team . have suffered is unbearable,' the players said about Hermann, . Rutgers' new athletic director who had served as the No. 2 . athletic administrator at Louisville. Democrat State Senator and former Governor Codey told the paper: 'This is becoming Comedy Central. 'It's an embarrassment to the students and alumni of a great . university and it's time Mr. Barchi take his show on the road.' Current Governor Christie said on Sunday that he would speak to Rutgers officials about the controversial athletics department but didn't call for any resignations. 'Comedy Central': Former New Jersey Governor Richard Codey said the latest Rutger's scandal is an 'embarrassment to the students and alumni of a great university' Axed: Former Rutgers coach Mike Rice was fired on April 3 after a video emerged of him shoving players and berating them with insults and gay slurs . 'Listen, I'm as curious as anybody . and given my position, I get to ask questions more quickly than others,' Christie said. 'So I'll be asking questions and we'll see what . happens.' State Senator Raymond Lesniak also spoke out against Barchi and claimed that Rutgers' former president, Richard McCormick, should return to the school. 'I've had problems with Barchi before . this. He's just in over his head and not capable of giving a forthright . answer,' Lesniak said, according to the New York Daily News. The 49-year-old Hermann, set to take over the Rutgers' program June 17, told The Star-Ledger she didn't remember the letter. The newspaper said that when it was read to her by phone Wednesday, she replied, 'Wow.' Hermann, the first woman to head Rutgers' athletic program and one of three female ADs at the 124 schools that make up college football's top tier, has promised a restart for the program following the ouster of its men's basketball coach and the resignation of other officials. She is set to replace Tim Pernetti, who quit last month after the firing of basketball coach Mike Rice. Investigations: Governor Chris Christie says he'll be 'asking questions and see what happens' Angry: The video, which was screened by ESPN, showed several moments when Mr Rice angrily pushed, shoved and grabbed his players during practices . Admission: Tim Pernetti, pictured right with Rice, has admitted that his decision to suspend Rice in December - and not fire him - was the wrong move . The video showed numerous clips of Rice firing basketballs at players, hitting them in the back, legs, feet and shoulders. It also showed him grabbing players by their jerseys and yanking them around the court. Rice can also be heard yelling obscenities and using anti-gay slurs. The controversy went public in April when ESPN aired the videos and Rutgers President Robert Barchi admitted he didn't view the video in the fall. Rice was fired and Pernetti, assistant . coach Jimmy Martelli and interim senior vice president and university . counsel John Wolf resigned. Whistleblower: The video was provided to ESPN by Eric Murdock, a former NBA player who also served as Rutgers' director of player development from 2010-2012 . Anger: In this clip, Mr Rice, in white, is seen gesturing aggressively towards one of the Rutgers players . Slurs: In one portion of the video, Rice unloads a homophobic rant against one of his players, saying: 'You f***ing fairy! You're a f***ing f****t!' After a series of interviews with many of the former Tennessee players about Hermann, The Star-Ledger said: 'Their accounts depict a coach who thought nothing of demeaning them, who would ridicule and laugh at them over their weight and their performances, sometimes forcing players to do 100 sideline pushups during games, who punished them after losses by making them wear their workout clothes inside out in public or not allowing them to shower or eat, and who pitted them against one another, cutting down particular players with the whole team watching, and through gossip. 'Several women said playing for Hermann had driven them into depression and counseling, and that her conduct had sullied the experience of playing Division I volleyball.' The Star-Ledger asked Hermann about the players' lingering grievances. 'I never heard any of this, never name-calling them or anything like that whatsoever,' she told the newspaper.

Waitorse has apologised to a customer after a member of staff refused to fillet a trout because it was deemed 'too slippery'. The bizarre decision was branded the latest example of health and safety rules being misused. The unnamed female customer was visiting her local branch of the upmarket chain to buy a filleted trout. Apology: A member of staff working behind the fish counter at Waitrose refused to fillet a trout because it was 'too slippery' None were available pre-packed so she asked the assistant behind the fresh fish counter if he could fillet some from a whole fish. He agreed, but his supervisor stepped in and refused on the grounds of health and safety because the fish are 'too slippery'. On its website Waitrose says 'just ask if you'd like your fish skinned or filleted'. In another case, London publishing company owner Stuart Rock said that a butcher had refused to bone a leg of lamb for him. He said the assistant had said he was 'competent to do the job', but was not permitted on health and safety ground. The woman who was unable to have a trout filleted complained to the Health and Safety Executive and yesterday the watchdog's Myth Buster Panel ruled that she was in the right. In a statement the panel said: 'Whilst fish filleting requires the . person to know how to use knives safely, it is reasonable to expect this . service to be available at a fishmonger's counter in a supermarket . especially when the website advertises the service. 'Slippery fish are a . fact of life!' it added. Slippery customer: The Health and Safety Executive ruled Waitrose was in the wrong for refusing to fillet a trout . Judith Hackitt, Chair of the Health and . Safety Executive said: 'I'm glad the customer didn't fall for this red . herring. This is just another case of poor customer service and nothing to do . with health and safety.' Waitrose apologised for the inconvenience to its customers. A spokesman said: 'I'm afraid we don't . know which branch this refers to so we are unable to comment in detail.

Protest: Maria Alyokhina, pictured last year, has gone on a hunger strike after a court blocked her from attending her parole hearing . A jailed member of the Russian punk group Pussy Riot was taken to hospital yesterday on the seventh day of her hunger strike. Maria Alekhina, 24, is protesting against what she claims is a campaign of persecution against her. She was transferred to a hospital in her prison colony in the Ural Mountains town of Berezniki, according to Pyotr Verzilov, the husband of one of her band mates, who visited the prison yesterday. Alekhina went on a hunger strike after she was barred from attending her own parole hearing. The court, which is across the street from the colony, denied her release. Three members of the band - Alekhina, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Yekaterina Samutsevich - were convicted last year of 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred' for an impromptu punk protest against Vladimir Putin in Moscow's main cathedral and given two-year sentences. Samutsevich was later released on appeal. Last month a court in the Mordovia province denied parole to Tolokonnikova, 23, who is married to Verzilov. In a letter dated Monday and published by her lawyers, Alekhina said prison officials were attempting to turn fellow inmates against her by holding a security crackdown in advance of the parole hearing. Inmates could previously enter and leave their workplace freely, but now they have to wait for up to an hour for prison guards to escort them, Alekhina's lawyer Irina Khrunova said. The wait denies them prompt medical care when they sustain injuries during their work sewing uniforms, she added. Samutsevich said the prison administration directly linked the crackdown to Alekhina's 'fight against the prison colony and her open statements against the violations of inmates' rights'. Pussy Riot: Yekaterina Samutsevich, Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova were convicted of 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred' in August last year . Anti Putin: Members of Pussy Riot, pictured before the 'punk prayer', performed a protest song in a protest song criticising Vladimir Putin in a central Moscow cathedral in February last year . She said the prison administration, . as an arm of the government, had taken a negative attitude toward the . Pussy Riot members from the beginning. 'This negative attitude has been . building up all the time and now it has turned into an open conflict . between the prison colony administration and Masha (Alekhina), and . surely this has very unpleasant consequences,' Samutsevich said . yesterday. Alekhina earlier spent five months in . solitary confinement after claiming that officials deliberately lodged . her with hardened criminals, including a convicted murderer, and . encouraged them to intimidate her. In a complaint filed in January, . Khrunova wrote that officials did nothing after seeing criminals . threaten Alekhina with violence. Helping hand: Sir Paul McCartney has written to the court asking them to allow Ms Alyokhina to attend her hearing . The lawyer said officials also wrote false psychiatric reports and pushed Alekhina into violating colony rules. Judges have recently lifted several reprimands that officials filed against Alekhina. Following Ms Alyokhina’s decision to . go on hunger strike, Sir Paul McCartney wrote to Russian authorities . asking them to consider her parole. The . former Beatle, who has previously expressed his support for the group, . has asked officials to grant Ms Alyokhina the right to be present at a . future hearing in several handwritten letters. He . said: ‘My personal belief is that further incarceration for Maria will . be harmful for her and the situation as a whole, which, of course, is . being watched by people all over the world. ‘In the great tradition of fair-mindedness which the Russian people (many of whom are my friends) are famous for, I believe that you granting this request would send a very positive message to all the people who have followed this case.’ In a further letter, regarding Ms Tolokonnikova, Sir Paul said: ‘I have had a long relationship with the Russian people, and, with this in mind, I am making the following request in a spirit of friendship for my many Russian acquaintances who, like me, believe in treating people - all people - with compassion and kindness.’ Ms Alyokhina's mother, Natalia, said . she had little faith in Russian justice and would not raise her hopes of . her daughter's parole. 'I don't expect anything good from the judge. It will be hard,' she said. According to documents read in court . Ms Alyokhina's behaviour in prison may risk her parole. She is said to . be rude to prison staff and to not respect sleeping hours. The three Pussy Riot members were convicted of 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred' last August, following a trial seen by their supporters as part of a clampdown on dissent by Putin during his third term in power.","Maria Alyokhina is serving two years for Moscow cathedral 'punk prayer'

The new batch of photos include pictures of Martin’s belongings on the night he was killed including the cell phone he used to speak to his girlfriend for the last time, plus the Skittles and bottle of ice tea he had just bought at a local 7/11.

The photos, taken by Zimmerman's defense team on Aug. 8 at a state crime lab, show other important pieces of evidence including the hoodie with a bullet hole in it that Trayvon wore, reports the Orlando Sentinel. Two photos that had not been released before Wednesday show Zimmerman in a cap and gown during a graduation ceremony at Seminole State College. Zimmerman was pursuing a two-year criminal justice degree, but while he attended the ceremony, school records show he did not actually graduate, having failed one of his classes. Other images, which have been seen before, include photos of Zimmerman with a broken and bloody nose and surveillance images showing Martin buying Skittles and a bottle of iced tea at a 7-Eleven just minutes before the deadly scuffle. Final moments: Included in the batch of photos released by Zimmerman's defense attorneys are surveillance images showing Martin buying Skittles and a bottle of iced tea at a 7-Eleven just minutes before the deadly scuffle . A photo of Trayvon Martin's hooded sweatshirt showing the bullet hole that killed him has been submitted by George Zimmerman's defense lawyers . This can of Arizona iced tea was found at the scene of Trayvon Martin's death . These are the photographs his defense team believe will best serve their client's self-defense case when his trial begins next month hope these are the images that .

It include items they opted not to . make public because of Florida privacy laws, including half dozen . autopsy photos of Martin plus 17 taken of him at the scene of the . shooting. The 29-year-olf former Neighborhood . Watch volunteer killed Trayvon, an unarmed black 17-year-old, on Feb. 26, 2012, after calling Sanford police and describing the teenager as . suspicious. Zimmerman's defense team also filed a motion on Tuesday asking the judge to deny a request by prosecutors to ban blood samples from Trayvon Martin's autopsy from being submitted as evidence during the trial. According to Zimmerman's lawyers, the results of those blood tests showed traces of marijuana in Martin's system, and they argue jurors should know that. Other images include photos of Zimmerman with a broken and bloody nose . Zimmerman volunteer killed Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black 17-year-old, on Feb. 26, 2012, after calling Sanford police and describing the teenager as suspicious . The defense claimed Martin brought pot with him to Sanford and used it at least once before he was killed. But prosecutors called that evidence irrelevant to the events surrounding the shooting, saying there was no evidence suggesting Martin used the pot at or even near the time of his death, and no witnesses have suggested that the level of marijuana in Martin's blood had any bearing on the cause of his death. Two weeks ago Zimmerman told a circuit judge he would not be seeking an immunity hearing under the state's ‘Stand Your Ground’ self-defense law. Under questioning from Circuit Judge Debra Nelson, George Zimmerman repeatedly said ‘yes’ to a series of questions asking if he was aware he was giving up the right to a hearing before his second-degree murder trial in June. Back in court: George Zimmerman, defendant in the killing of Trayvon Martin, arrives with his attorney Mark O'Mara, right, for a pre-trial hearing . Heavy burden: Zimmerman, pictured left during his latest court appearance and right in a mugshot,  reportedly has put on more than 100lbs from the time of his arrest in 2012 . A judge would have sole discretion in an . immunity hearing to decide if Zimmerman is exempt from culpability in . the shooting. A jury would make the determination in the murder trial. ‘After consultation with my counsel, yes, your honor,’ Zimmerman said. The judge had set aside two weeks at the end of April for an immunity hearing should Zimmerman want one. Prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda had filed a motion asking that Zimmerman make clear his intentions on whether he wanted the hearing. Zimmerman's defense attorney, Mark O'Mara, told the judge there was nothing in the law that required the immunity hearing to take place before Zimmerman's trial and could be requested after prosecutors have presented their case. Major move: The former neighborhood watch leader told a judge that he will not seek an immunity hearing under the state's 'Stand Your Ground' self-defense law . High-profile case: Zimmerman (left) is accused of shooting dead Trayvon Martin (right), an unarmed 17-year-old boy, during a February 2012 confrontation in a gated community in Florida . ‘We'd much rather have the jury address the issue of criminal liability or lack thereof,’ O'Mara said. Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty, claiming self-defense. Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old boy, was fatally shot February 26, 2012, during a fight with Zimmerman in a Sanford gated community. O'Mara also wanted the court to unseal details on a civil settlement totaling more than $1million that Martin's parents received from Zimmerman's homeowner's association. O'Mara contended the settlement could influence the testimony of Martin's parents, if they are called as witnesses. The judge said defense attorneys and prosecutors could see full copies of the settlement but the public would only be able to see a version from which some information has been removed. Opposing sides: Zimmerman's attorney Mark O'Mara (left) asked the court to unseal details of a settlement that Martin's parents, represented by Benjamin Crump (right), received from homeowner's association . Nelson rejected a request by O'Mara to find fault with prosecutors for what the defense attorney described as violations in providing discovery evidence to them. O'Mara said that prosecutors' failure to disclose evidence in a timely manner had caused his team ‘hours and hours of work.’ The judge said she would hold a hearing after the trial to determine if prosecutors should have to pay for some costs that O'Mara said he incurred because of the alleged discovery problems.","Zimmerman's second-degree murder trial is set to start next month .

Graduating high school on Saturday was especially emotional for 18-year-old Alyson Costilla as it fell just days after she lost her mom to the tornado which hit the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore at the start of the week. Terri Long was one of 24 people killed in Monday’s devastating tornado. As the storm hit she called her daughter and told her to drive as far south as she could, while she sought refuge in a 7-Eleven bathroom. When the storm was over Alyson couldn’t reach her mom by phone and after she and her sister had called all the local hospitals they found out the tragic news that she was dead. Emotional ceremony: Alyson Costilla, 18, graduated high school on Saturday just days after losing her mom to the terrible tornado that struck Moore, Oklahoma on Monday . An emotional Alyson said she missed her mom at her graduation because she wanted to hug her . On Friday Alyson buried her mom and the next morning was her graduation. ‘She talked about how exciting, like how excited she was to see me walk across the stage,’ Alyson told NBC News. ‘How excited she was going to be for me to move to college.’ In a heartfelt tribute to her mom, when Alyson’s name was called during Saturday’s ceremony friends and family in the audience not only cheered her, but held aloft large photographs of Terri Long. ‘It's just really hard because I wanted her there, and you can't physically hug her,’ said Alyson, choking back tears. Saturday's graduations for Westmoore, Southmoore and Moore high schools are another step toward normalcy for the Oklahoma City suburb ravaged by an extremely strong tornado. Monday's twister killed 24, including seven children at Plaza Towers Elementary School. When Alyson's name was called at Saturday's graduation ceremony friends and family in the audience not only cheered her, but held aloft large photographs of her mom . Alyson graduated high school on Saturday and will now attend Oklahoma State University . ‘I wouldn't want to be in any other place. It's our roots. Tornadoes are a part of life here,’ said 18-year-old Brooke Potter, whose current college aspirations will take her to two neighboring towns. Other students also vowed that graduation wouldn't be their farewell to Moore. ‘I want to end up back here,’ Madison Dobbs, 18, said. ‘I've been here my whole life and can't picture myself anywhere else. Tornadoes happen anywhere.’ While that's true, few other places have the amount and severity of tornadoes like Oklahoma - and no other place has had a tornado like Moore. The Storm Prediction Center in Norman says the Oklahoma City area has been struck by more tornadoes than any other U.S. city, citing records that date to 1893. When the current graduating class was in second grade, Moore experienced an EF4 tornado with winds approaching 200 mph. And three months before they started pre-kindergarten, a twister with the highest winds on record - 302 mph - sliced through their town. Terri Long was one of 24 people killed in Monday's devastating tornado, while she sought refuge in a 7-Eleven . The 7-Eleven convenient store where Terri Long sought refuge was destroyed by the killer tornado that hit Moore, Oklahoma on Monday . ‘Crazy storms happen; the goods outweigh the bads,’ said Potter, who wants to attend Oklahoma City Community College, and then transfer to the University of Oklahoma in neighboring Norman. With graduates wearing red, blue or black caps and gowns, Westmoore was the first of three schools to hold commencement ceremonies Saturday at the Cox Convention Center in Oklahoma City. A teacher in the district said despite being big enough to have three high schools, the 56,000-strong community is still tightly knit. ‘This is such a big district, but this is a small town,’ said Tammy Glasgow, a second-grade teacher at Briarwood Elementary, which was also destroyed but didn't have any deaths. ‘When you see somebody in the street, it's not a “hi” and a handshake, it's a hug.’ Some students lost everything in the violent storm. Southmoore senior Callie Dosher, 18, said she sifted through the debris of her family's destroyed home in the past few days, looking to recover precious possessions - her mom's two Bibles and the teddy bear Callie's granddad gave her shortly before he passed away. Southmoore High School senior Jake Spradling hugs a classmate as they get ready to attend their commencement ceremony in Oklahoma City on Saturday . Southmoore High School senior Miranda Mann, center, talks to a classmate as they get ready to attend their commencement ceremony on Saturday . But Dosher, too, wants to stay: ‘These people, I've grown up with them. I have all my friends here,’ she said. Miranda Mann, an 18-year-old Southmoore grad whose family also lost their home, couldn't recognize her own neighborhood because of the damage. Yet the family has vowed to rebuild on the same ground. ‘We loved the house we were in,’ she said. ‘But we get to make new memories in the new house.’ Westmoore Senior Alex Davis, 18, will attend University of Oklahoma after graduation partly so he can stay close to friends and family. ‘It speaks to how the community's banded together,’ he said. ‘We're not going to let a natural disaster beat us.’ Video: Watch Alyson Costilla talk about losing her mom and her graduation . , .","Alyson Costilla lost her mom during Monday's tornado .

In addition to news of the sex . discrimination lawsuit, a member of the Rutgers' athletic director . search committee said she was dumbfounded that the firm hired to vet . potential candidates for the athletic director's job never uncovered . allegations by former Tennessee women's volleyball players that Hermann . verbally abused them while she was their coach. The Star-Ledger reported . the claims for Sunday editions. The new boss: Hermann, the first woman to head Rutgers' athletic department, has promised a restart for the program . Axed: Former Rutgers coach Mike Rice was fired on April 3 after a video emerged of him shoving players and berating them with insults and gay slurs . 'One of the primary reasons for using a . search firm is that they're supposed to completely vet a candidate for a . senior management position, so I'm a little mystified as to why this . comes from the press and not the search committee,' said Susan Schurman, . dean of the School of Management and Labor Relations at Rutgers, who . was on the search committee but out of the country for much of the . process. Yet the embattled athletic director . also found some allies. A retired Tennessee official and a former . graduate assistant each voiced support for Hermann during her tenure . with the Vols. Joan Cronan, women's athletic director . emeritus at Tennessee, said in a statement that she holds Hermann in . high regard, and that while the ex-coach's tenure in the 1990s 'was a . very frustrating time for everyone connected with the volleyball . program, I do not recall it being an abusive situation.' Hermann denied having knowledge of a . letter players say they submitted to the school. She acknowledged she . made mistakes, but says she has matured and believes she is qualified to . lead Rutgers. 'I believe she is well-prepared for . her new role at Rutgers University,' Cronan wrote. 'After Julie's sixth . season as the head volleyball coach, I decided that a change was needed, . and I moved Julie to a position in athletics administration.' Angry: The video, which was screened by ESPN, showed several moments when Mr Rice angrily pushed, shoved and grabbed his players during practices . Admission: Tim Pernetti, pictured right with Rice, has admitted that his decision to suspend Rice in December - and not fire him - was the wrong move . Marc Gesualdo, a graduate assistant . for the Volunteers' sports information department from 1994-96, said he . didn't see any instances of abuse while handling media inquiries for the . volleyball program under Hermann. He attended virtually all of . Tennessee's games during that stretch, but he wasn't at all practices. 'Never did I see anything that I would . deem as inappropriate or just like so outlandish that it was bordering . on abuse,' Gesualdo said. 'I can't say I saw anything at all that . bordered on abuse.' Still, the Louisville lawsuit is bound . to bring greater focus on the hiring of the 49-year-old Hermann. On . Monday, Hermann said that she has no plans to resign and Barchi later . said the university was standing behind her. Whether Hermann stays or goes, the . past two months have been a huge embarrassment for Rutgers, which was . celebrating an invitation in November to join the Big Ten Conference in . 2014. After Rice was ousted and Pernetti was . forced to resign, the university said new basketball coach Eddie Jordan . had a degree from Rutgers when he didn't. There was additional . controversy when men's lacrosse coach Brian Brecht was suspended for . verbally abusing his players following a university-wide investigation . into all Scarlet Knights coaches. Brecht missed the final two games of . the season. Whistleblower: The video was provided to ESPN by Eric Murdock, a former NBA player who also served as Rutgers' director of player development from 2010-2012 . Slurs: In one portion of the video, Rice unloads a homophobic rant against one of his players, saying: 'You f***ing fairy!

Contrary to the stereotype of the old curmudgeon, happiness increases with age, according to new research. But while experts discovered that all people become happier with age, those who were born during periods of hardship reported a lesser sense of life satisfaction than those born in times of peace and prosperity. In the past, good psychological health has been linked . to many life factors including career, relationships and even health. Until now, it was not clear how feelings of happiness change as we age. The new study discovered that life satisfaction increases as people grow older. Scientists did however find the extent of this increase was affected by hardship you may have lived through as a young person . Psychological scientist Angelina Sutin, of Florida State University College of Medicine, conducted the . study while at the National Institute on Aging (NIA) at the National . Institutes of Health (NIH). She . and colleagues predicted that people in the same 'birth cohort' - born around the same time - may have had unique experiences that shape . the way they evaluate happiness and optimism. They predicted that the . level of wellbeing a person reported would vary according . to his or her birth year. Don't believe it: The stereotype of old people being grumpy is inaccurate, according to the U.S. study . Using two large-scale studies - one from NIH’s Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and the other from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey - researchers looked at data from several thousand people over 30 years, including over 10,000 reports on happiness, health, and other factors. When the researchers analysed the data, older adults had lower levels of wellbeing than younger and middle-aged adults. But when researchers analysed the same data taking birth cohort into account, a different trend appeared: Life satisfaction increased over all the participants’ lifetimes. This trend remained even after factors like health, medication, sex, ethnicity, and education were taken into account. But experts did find that people born between 1885 and 1925 started off with lower levels of happiness in comparison to people born more recently. Sutin explained that looking at life satisfaction across all of the participants, regardless of when they were born, obscures the fact that each cohort actually shows the same underlying trend: that they became happier. She also pointed out that the happiness of those born in the early 20th century, particularly those who lived through the Great Depression, was substantially lower than the level of  happiness of cohorts who grew up during more prosperous times. Tough times: Scientists said their findings could have implications for today's youth who are born into recession and high unemployment . The greater happiness of more recent cohorts could be the result of economic prosperity, increased educational opportunities, and social improvements over the latter half of the 20th century. And according to the researchers, these findings may have important implications for today’s younger generations. 'As young adults today enter a stagnant workforce, the challenges of high unemployment may have implications for their wellbeing that long outlast the period of joblessness. 'Economic turmoil may impede psychological, as well as financial, growth even decades after times get better.' The study was published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science.","U.S. study found that people become more satisfied with life as they age .

The major American intimate apparel manufacturer, Jockey, recently announced it is getting rid of A/B/C/D cups altogether. Instead, Jockey's new Volumetric Fit System measures the volume of a woman's breast - with sizes running from 1 through 10 - as well as their under-bust measurement to create a 'near-custom' fit. But for $60 per bra, and $19.95 for the try-at-home kit available online, skeptical customers have had reservations about the new system. So FEMAIL took Jockey's volumetric sizing kit for a test drive, to see just how well it shaped up. Good fit: Jockey's new Volumetric Fit System comes with 10 plastic cups, a measuring tape and instructions on how to find your perfect bra size . Using Jockey's flexible plastic . measuring 'cups' in varying shapes, we tried each one on for size to . see what worked best - with the least amount of gapping spillage. Next came measuring under the bust, using the color-coded, and double-sided (for mirror reflection ease) measuring band. There are seven different band sizes to choose from - 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 or 42. However I measured 31, and am still not quite sure where that leaves me. Patented: The Double Lined Contour Bra (left) and the Classic Contour Bra (right), $60 each, are two options in Jockey's new JOCKEY Bra range and have a patented 3-D contour design that does away with underwires . Soft support: The Classic Soft Cup Bra (left) and the Double Lined Soft Cup Bra (right) have 'unique 3-D Inner Sling Support for a revolutionary soft cup' that has no underwire, but gives firm support . To give customers piece of mind, however, Jockey offers a Love at First Fit guarantee promise - or your money back. And while the Volumetric Fit System costs $19.95 from Jockey.com, this amount is actually redeemable as a $19.95 discount off the price of your first bra. 'It’s always a risk when you change something that’s been in the market . for a very long time, but not only are we changing the fit, we’re . changing the whole product,' explained. Jockey's senior vice president, Sally . Tomkins. DIY measuring: Jockey's new bra fitting system enables women to measure themselves at home to find their perfect fit using 10 different-sized plastic cups . 'It took us eight years to develop . the new Jockey bra and its revolutionary Volumetric Fit System,' said . Sally Tomkins, Jockey's senior vice president of design, research and . development. 'Through . our research, and countless hours of testing and talking with women, we . are confident we are answering women's desire for the perfect-fitting . bra.' Current standard cup sizes are based . on two measurements - the breast at its fullest . point, minus the rib cage measurement. A one-inch difference equates to . an A cup; a two-inch difference, a B cup, and so on. Price point: The Volumetric Fit System costs $19.95 from Jockey.com, which redeemable as a $19.95 discount off the price of your first bra . Jockey . International says this 80-year-old equation doesn’t account for volume and . different breast shapes. The bra itself (FEMAIL was sent the Classic Contour to try in a size 2-32) is padded and extremely soft, giving full coverage; but we do have some reservations. Although Joceky has replaced traditional bra underwires with '3-D contour support,' the hard material feels much like the underwire of my usual bra, anyway. And after using the cup fitting system - determining my bra size as 3 - the size 2 sample bra felt gappy, rather than too small. Which lead to some measurement confusion. Bra shopping is notoriously . traumatic, with research showing 75per cent of women have trouble . finding a bra that fits properly, and a staggering 85per cent of women are wearing the wrong sized bra. While FEMAIL appreciated the ease of a 'buy online and try-at-home' service, we felt we still needed guidance as to whether our measuring techniques were correct. According to research on Jockey's website, 53per cent of women have never been professionally fitted for a bra - and DIY fitting, despite Jockey's sophisticated fitting system, is still no 'professional' fit. Finding a 'true' bra size is never as 'simple' as a simple two-step process. While innovative, the Volumetric Fit System is still best tried within the supportive confines of a Jockey store.","Jockey spent eight years developing Volumetric Fit System based on breast volume .

A six-week-old baby died after three doctors failed to spot a treatable illness. Over nine days James Payne was seen by a GP, an out-of-hours doctor and then a locum after he developed a nasty cough – but he was sent home each time. Hours after the third visit, his mother Mandy, 33, found him lifeless in his Moses basket with his face blue and blood coming from his nose. She desperately tried to resuscitate him on the living room floor in front of her two-year-old daughter, but could not save him. Mrs Payne said: ‘I screamed and cradled him while I called the ambulance but I knew then he was gone and it was too late. 'I put him on the floor and desperately tried to resuscitate him. I can remember the taste of his blood in my mouth and thinking “I can’t believe this is happening to me”.’ An inquest heard the cause of death was a build-up of fluid in his lungs and inflammation of his throat caused by a viral infection. One of the doctors told the inquest that hospital treatment would have saved James. All three claimed they were not aware of his breathing problems – a claim the family disputes. Recording a narrative verdict, Southend Coroner Yvonne Blake said ‘no organisation identified’ the illness. Mrs Payne and her husband Andrew, 38, plan to sue the NHS. Mr Payne, a surveyor, said: ‘I feel James was robbed from me, from my family – it is someone’s fault and someone has to be held accountable for that. It is an unbearable loss which only someone who has lost a baby can ever understand. ‘It is an unimaginable pain I feel daily and I want answers as to why this was ever allowed to happen.’ James' parents, Mandy and Andrew, took him to three different GPs but they claim each one failed to provide him with the treatment that could have saved his life. They are pictured with their daughter, Chloe, 2 . Mrs Payne, of Hadleigh, Essex, first . took her son to her local GP when he had a bad cough in November last . year. But he was sent away with paracetamol and nasal drops. Less than a week later she called the . NHS out-of-hours doctor service and was told to take her son to . Southend Hospital to be seen by a doctor, who said he suspected a . possible viral infection but claimed that was normal in a child of his . age. Hours after his third visit to a doctor, James' mother found him lifeless in his cot with blood coming from his nose. She tried to resuscitate him in front of two-year-old Chloe but he was already dead . On the morning of James’s death, Mrs . Payne made an appointment with a locum doctor at her GP surgery. She . says the doctor did not examine her son’s chest despite telling him that . his breathing had worsened. The doctor told the inquest that he . could not remember if he had removed James’s clothes or exposed his . chest for examination. He denied that Mrs Payne had told him that her . son had a wheezy cough. An inquest into James' death heard he died from a build-up of fluid in his lungs caused by a viral infection. His mother says she doesn't know how to tell Chloe what happened to her brother . On November 12, 2012, Mrs Payne took James to the Kent Elm Surgery in Eastwood because he had developed a bad cough. Dr Maciej Bobnis gave him nasal drops and paracetamol. Less than a week later James' breathing became wheezy so Mrs Payne took him to an out-of-hours GP at Southend University Hospital. Here, Dr Hewa Dharmarathna concluded that James looked 'well' and said he probably had a normal viral infection. On the morning of James' death, nine days after he was first taken to a doctor, Mrs Payne took him back to Kent Elm Surgery where he saw the locum, Dr Balavinayak Mohankumar. The doctor claims he was not told that James was wheezing - Mrs Payne strongly refutes this claim. Later that day, Mrs Payne found James dead in his cot. Just hours later, Mrs Payne found her son dead. Mr Payne said: ‘As a father I look to . protect my family and I feel like I failed as a dad. 'I loved him so . much and we lost him far, far too soon. 'Every day I wake up and the first . two, three seconds, it hits you all over again and a piece of your heart . simply breaks again. 'And it continues to break all day. ‘I drive past the park and I see . fathers and their sons having a kick about and I know I will never be . able to do that with my son. 'I’ve had that taken away from me and I am . incredibly angry.

'However, we cannot . comment on individual cases.’ A spokesman for Southend University . Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘We offer our sincere condolences to . the family and will continue to support them at this sad time.’ During the hearing all three doctors claimed they were not told about the infant's breathing problems - with one GP admitting hospital treatment might have saved his life - but his parents strongly refute these claims .","James Payne developed a cough and wheezing a few weeks after his birth .

Louise had a farewell party for her left leg (left) before it was amputated four years ago. She has documented much of her experience with photos, such as just before her leg was removed. The black arrow drawn on her leg indicates where surgeons should cut (right) Louise, pictured after her first amputation and second year of chemotherapy, in 2008 . The cancer behaved very oddly and returned each time doctors tried to remove it, so in 2008 they were forced to amputate part of her leg.

But just weeks after her two-year . wedding anniversary with her husband, the couple were given . the devastating news that she only had weeks to live. The cancer had spread to . her lungs, next to her liver and where her ribs and shoulder blade meet. 'We both kind of knew it would happen . eventually but for a couple of weeks were in a bit of shock,' said Mr . Ainsley. 'Eventually, we pulled together and just decided to . stay positive.

I still have all the daily ‘Bye, see you later’ goodbyes for . my friends and family. But then, there are the much harder goodbyes, where I know I . won’t see that person again in this life. And over the last weeks I’ve had to get through a few of . those goodbyes as my friends from overseas have visited me (you know who you . are and I love you). And it’s so painful and so hard and heart-crushingly awful . and feels so unfair. I’m there hugging someone and not wanting to ever let . go.  But I have to.

I used to have this silly superstition that I could never . let someone go or say ‘bye to them if there was some kind of negative feeling . in the air (we’ve all slammed doors after an argument, or hung up on people . we’re angry with).

Mothers who undergo weight-loss surgery are less likely to have obese children because it affects the baby's genes in the womb, according to new research. It has been known for some time that obese mothers tend to have overweight children, but until now it was thought to be solely linked to lifestyle factors such as poor diet and lack of exercise. But the new study discovered that children born to mothers who underwent weight-loss surgery possessed genes that worked differently to their older siblings who were born before the mother underwent the procedure. Pregnant women who are obese expose their babies to higher levels of sugar and fat which in turn affects their genes. It is thought that genes play an important role in deciding whether a person goes on to be overweight . Experts discovered that children born after their mother lost a large amount of weight were slimmer than their siblings. They also had fewer risk factors for diabetes or heart disease later in life. Clearly diet and exercise play a huge role in how large a child grows up to be, but the findings suggest that children born after their mother's surgery might have an advantage. 'The impact on the genes, you will see the impact for the rest of your life,' said Dr. Marie-Claude Vohl of Laval University in Quebec City, who led the research. Experts said that it isn't that a mother passes on different genes, but how those genes operate in her child's body. Scientists found that children born before a mother's weight-loss surgery were more likely to be overweight . Researchers took blood samples from children born to 20 women before and after complex . surgery that shrank their stomachs and rerouted digestion, so they absorbed . less fat and calories. On average, they lost about 100 pounds. After comparing chemical tags in more than 5,600 genes . between the younger and older siblings, they found significant differences . in the activity of certain genes clustered in pathways known to affect . blood sugar metabolism and heart disease risk. Dr. John Kral of New York's SUNY Downstate . Medical Center, who co-authored the study, said that foetuses . are 'marinated, and they're differently marinated' depending on a mother's weight and health. He explained that factors inside the womb seem to affect the 'dimmer switches' that develop on a foetus' genes - chemical changes that make genes speed up or slow down or switch on and off. Overweight mothers have higher levels of sugar and fat in the bloodstream, which travels to the womb and the baby inside. This . may do more than overstimulate fetal growth. Scientists know that . certain molecules regulate gene activity, attaching like chemical tags. Dr. Susan Murphy of Duke University, who was not involved in the Canadian research but studies uterine effects on later health, said it made biological sense that the earliest nutritional environment could affect a developing metabolism, although she cautions that healthier family habits after a mother's surgery may play a role, too. The research has implications far beyond the relatively few women who take the drastic step of gastric bypass surgery before having a baby. Dr Murphy added that obesity is 'not just impacting your life, it's impacting your child.' All mothers put on weight during pregnancy. Over a third of any extra weight will come from the baby, the placenta and the amniotic fluid. On average, the baby, placenta and amniotic fluid will total 4.8kg (10lb 9oz). The rest of the weight can be accounted for by the changes that happen in the mother's body while pregnant. The womb grows dramatically and weighs an extra 0.9kg (2lb), blood volume increases and weighs an extra 1.2kg (2.6lb), extra fluid in the body weighs about 1.2kg (2.6lb), breasts weigh an extra 0.4kg (0.9lb) and extra fat, about 4kg (8.8lb), will be stored to give energy for breastfeeding. By the end of pregnancy, a woman may weigh about 12.5kg (27.6lb) more than she did before you became pregnant. There are no official guidelines for weight gain in pregnancy in the UK, although it is advised that women who are normal weight at the start of pregnancy should gain 25lb (11.3kg) to 35lb (15.8kg) Those who already are obese should gain no more than 11lb (4.9kg) to 20lb (9.1kg). Overweight mothers-to-be fall in the middle.

Whether listening to the blues or pop, the human brain is wired to make the same music-colour connections wherever we come from, according to a new study. Experts discovered that the colour a person associated with a melody depends on how it makes them feel and not the culture they came from. This . suggests that humans share a common emotional palette when it comes to . music and colour that appears to be intuitive and can cross cultural . barriers. Singing (and seeing) the blues: Research carried out by UC Berkeley found that regardless of where you are born, the same colours are associated with the same melodies . In the study, Mozart's uplifting Flute Concerto No. 1 in G major was most associated with bright yellow and orange, whereas his dour Requiem in D minor was more likely to be linked to dark, bluish grey. Moreover, people in both the United States and Mexico linked the same pieces of classical orchestral music with the same colours. 'The results were remarkably strong and consistent across individuals and cultures and clearly pointed to the powerful role that emotions play in how the human brain maps from hearing music to seeing colors,' said Professor Stephen Palmer, lead author of a paper,  University of California, Berkeley. Using a 37-colour palette, the study found that people tend to pair faster-paced music in a major key with lighter, more vivid, yellow colors, whereas slower-paced music in a minor key is more likely to be teamed up with darker, greyer, bluer colors. Scientists hope that the findings will shed light on synesthesia, a condition that links specific colours with places and even numbers . 'Surprisingly, we can predict with 95 percent accuracy how happy or sad the colours people pick will be based on how happy or sad the music is that they are listening to,' said Professor Palmer. The findings may have implications for creative therapies, advertising and even music player gadgetry. For example, they could be used to create more emotionally engaging electronic music visualisers, computer software that generates animated imagery synchronized to the music being played. Currently the colours and patterns appear to be randomly generated and do not take emotion into account, researchers said. They may also provide insight into synesthesia, a neurological condition in which the stimulation of one perceptual pathway, such as hearing music, leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a different perceptual pathway, such as seeing colors. Synesthesia is a condition in which one sense is simultaneously perceived as if by one or more additional senses such as sight. Another form of synesthesia joins objects such as letters, shapes, numbers or people's names with a sensory perception such as smell, colour or flavour. Around 4% of people are thought to have the condition which is eight times more common in women. Most synesthesists tend to be left-handed . There are no dangerous side-effects to the having the condition . Famous synesthesists include Marilyn Monroe, Mary J Blige as well as the artists Kandinsky and Hockney. An example of sound-to-color synesthesia was portrayed in the 2009 movie The Soloist when cellist Nathaniel Ayers experiences a mesmerizing interplay of swirling colors while listening to the Los Angeles symphony. Artists such as Wassily Kandinksky and Paul Klee may have used music-to-color synesthesia in their creative endeavours. Around 100 men and women participated in the study, of which half resided in the San Francisco Bay Area and the other half in Guadalajara, Mexico. In three experiments, they listened to 18 classical music pieces by composers Johann Sebastian Bach, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Johannes Brahms that varied in tempo and in major versus minor keys. In the first experiment, participants were asked to pick five of the 37 colors that best matched the music to which they were listening. The palette consisted of vivid, light, medium, and dark shades of red, orange, yellow, green, yellow-green, green, blue-green, blue, and purple. Participants consistently picked bright, vivid, warm colors to go with upbeat music and dark, dull, cool colors to match the more tearful or somber pieces. Separately, they rated each piece of music on a scale of happy to sad, strong to weak, lively to dreary and angry to calm. Two . subsequent experiments studying music-to-face and face-to-color . associations supported the researchers' hypothesis that 'common emotions . are responsible for music-to-color associations'. Study participants listened to 18 classical music by composers Bach, Mozart and Brahms that varied in tempo and in major versus minor keys. They were then asked to associated certain colours with the pieces . For example, the same pattern occurred when participants chose the facial expressions that 'went best' with the music selections. Upbeat music in major keys was consistently paired with happy-looking faces while subdued music in minor keys was paired with sad-looking faces. Similarly, happy faces were paired with yellow and other bright colours and angry faces with dark red hues. Next, Professor Palmer and his research team plan to study participants in Turkey where traditional music employs a wider range of scales than just major and minor. 'We know that in Mexico and the U.S. the responses are very similar,"" he said. 'But we don't yet know about China or Turkey.'","Study by UC Berkeley found that people associate uplifting music with yellow and orange hues and sober melodies with greyish blue .

Former police officer Dennis Stewart will receive over £600,000 in compensation after delays in his hospital treatment left him needing his leg amputated . An award-winning police officer is in line for a £600,000 compensation payout after doctors delayed his treatment for so long they were forced to amputate his leg. Dennis Stewart, 52, who was undergoing treatment for a rare form of nasal cancer, was left waiting for 13 hours in A&E when he was rushed into hospital with a blood clot in his left leg. Doctors at Nottingham City Hospital originally dismissed the pain as cramp on December 30, 2010. But he was rushed back to the same hospital the following day after waking up in the middle of the night in agonising pain. Despite . discovering tell-tale signs of a dangerous clot, Mr Stewart was forced . to wait for over half a day for an ambulance to transfer him to Queen's . Medical Centre - just four miles away. Because . of the delay, specialists were unable to save his limb despite an . operation - putting to an end his 20-year career as a . policeman. He is now in line to receive a £600,000 compensation payout after Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust . admitted that the delay in his treatment was unacceptable. The former PC, from Nottingham, said: 'I waited far too long to see a doctor and I've paid my price. 'I don't want to criticise any doctors or nurses. They work hard - it's the system which doesn't work. 'On . the day it happened I woke up in the middle of the night with such . searing pain in my leg that I called a friend and got them to take me to . Nottingham City Hospital. 'I was there by 3.30am. Eventually they told me a specialist would have to come from another hospital to see my leg. 'The, at about 1pm, a nurse said she would get an ambulance for me to transfer me to the Queen's Medical Centre. 'But it wasn't until around 5pm that they eventually brought the ambulance - I was in agony. 'They rushed me into theatre once I got there - but I had lost all feeling and movement in my toes by then. 'After the operation, when I first looked at my leg they told me I might be shocked. PC Dennis Stewart won a Lifetime Achievement Award for his services to the force. He was also twice commended for persuading a suicidal man not to throw himself off a multi-storey car park and for stopping thieves during a post-office raid . 'I've seen murders and suicides as a policeman and when I looked down and it did not look like a leg. 'They amputated the next day - I was devastated.' It later emerged that the blood clot had formed while Mr Stewart was undergoing treatment for a rare form of nasal cancer which had developed behind his left eye. During . his 21-year career he was twice commended for persuading a suicidal man . not to throw himself off a multi-storey car park and for stopping . thieves during a post-office raid. In 2011, Mr Stewart was presented with a lifetime achievement award after returning to work following the amputation. Mr Stewart's lawyer said that the 'tragic' situation could have been easily avoided if the right procedures had been in place . His solicitors have told him to expect a total payment of up to £617,000 after the Trust admitted partial liability. Mr Stewart added: 'Firstly I want to get a new leg, the money is for my quality of life; I need to make that as good as possible. 'I don't mind the cancer, but it would have been a lot easier to deal with if I had my leg. 'I miss my salsa dancing, I miss my karate. Now I want to get a bungalow I can walk around easier and go and see the world. 'I just want the NHS to sort it out and make sure it never happens again.' James Bell, a clinical negligence lawyer representing Mr Stewart, said: 'Dennis' tragic situation is one that could have been so easily avoided were the right procedures in place. 'He should never have lost his leg. 'This case is not about bashing the NHS, but ensuring that Dennis receives justice and is able to enjoy the best quality of life.' Dr Stephen Fowlie, medical director at Nottingham University Hospitals, yesterday apologised for the error. He said: 'We are very sorry Mr Stewart's treatment was delayed, with such distressing consequences. 'We hope to reach a final settlement as soon as possible.'","Dennis Stewart, 53, was turned away by doctors after suffering leg pain .

Probiotics found in natural yogurt could help boost a person’s mood because they affect brain function, according to new research. Previous studies had shown that beneficial bacteria affected the brains of rats but no research has confirmed that the same occurred in human brains. The study found that those who ate probiotic yoghurt twice daily for a month showed altered brain function, both in resting brain activity and in response to an 'emotional attention task', which was designed to monitor how the brain responded to certain emotions. Dairy goodness: Scientists discovered that eating probiotic yogurt twice a day for a month reduced activity in areas of the brain associated with emotion and pain . It has been known for some time that symbiotic gut bacteria, the complex ecosystem of microorganisms that live in the human digestive system, promote health by boosting immunity, aiding digestion, as well as maintain a healthy weight and blood pressure. It has also been known that the brain sends signals to the gut, which is why stress and other emotions can contribute to gastrointestinal symptoms. This study shows that signals travel the opposite way as well. ‘Our findings indicate that some of the contents of yogurt may actually change the way our brain responds to the environment. ‘When we consider the implications of this work, the old sayings ""you are what you eat"" and ""gut feelings'"" take on new meaning,’ said Dr. Kirsten Tillisch of UCLA's School of Medicine, who led the study. Beneficial bacteria found in fermented products such a yoghurt have long been known to boost immunity . ‘Time and time again we hear from patients that they never felt depressed or anxious until they started experiencing problems with their gut. ‘Our study shows that the gut-brain connection is a two-way street,’ she added. Tillisch's team recruited 36 women of a healthy weight aged between 18 and 53. They were assigned to one of three groups. One group ate a yogurt with live bacterial cultures  containing probiotic strains such as Bifidobacterium animalis, Streptococcus thermophiles, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus twice a day for one month. Another ate a dairy product which contained no living bacteria, and another was given no dairy products at all. Before and after the one-month study period, the researchers conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scans on the women. In each session, they started with a five-minute scan of the brain at rest, while the women lay still with their eyes closed. Afterwards, the participants were asked to perform an ‘emotional faces attention task’, in which their brains were scanned while they matched a series of angry or fearful faces on a computer screen to other faces that appeared. The results showed that during the emotional task, women who ate the probiotic yogurt had reduced activity in a brain network that included the somatosensory cortex - which receives sensory information - and the insula, a brain region that integrates sensory feedback from internal parts of the body including the gut. You are what you eat?: Probiotic yoghurts are already very popular in the UK. The findings show that nutritional therapy could one day play a vital role in treating patients with disorders that cause pain and emotional upset . They also had reduced activity in the . prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and basal ganglia, which handle aspects of . cognition and emotion. The women who ate non-probiotic yogurt or no dairy showed either no change, or an increase of activity in this network over time. In the resting state, the brain scans of the women who ate probiotic yogurt showed stronger connectivity in a neural network which connects the periaqueductal grey (PAG) &mdash a region of the brainstem involved in responding to pain and emotional stimuli — to areas of the prefrontal cortex related to aspects of cognition like decision-making. Experts hope that one day probiotics may provide a therapy for neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's . The women who ate no dairy, however, had stronger connectivity of the PAG to sensory and emotion-related parts of the brain, like the insula, somatosensory cortex, and amygdala. The mechanisms behind these changes are unclear, wrote the researchers, but it's clear that gut bacteria send molecular signals to the brain that can change over time. Dr. Emeran Mayer, who also worked on the study, said that what we eat alters the way our gut bacteria breaks down food. While diets high in vegetables and fibre promote healthy gut bacteria, the typical Western diet full of fats, sugars, and carbohydrates, can do the opposite. The research team hopes to identify which signals from the gut bacteria lead to a shift in brain activity. People with digestive conditions linked to gut dysbiosis (an imbalances in gut bacteria) such as irritable bowel syndrome, might show such shifts in brain response if they are treated with probiotics. Dr Mayer also suggested that specific probiotic strains in yogurt could have health benefits such as relieving anxiety, stress, and other mood symptoms over time. As tests to analyse bacteria growth in individuals become more readily available, it will become easier to see how someone's gut bacteria makeup influences factors like brain development, stress, and pain sensitivity. It is possible that changing the composition of gut bacteria could lead to treatments for chronic pain disorders, he said, as well as symptoms of brain conditions like autism, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease.","U.S. researchers found that eating yoghurt twice daily reduced activity in areas of the brain associated with emotion and pain .

It may have been millions of years since our ancestors lived among the branches but it seems many of us still carry an unusual relic of our tree-dwelling days. New research shows that one in 13 humans walk around on chimp-like feet that feature the same adaptation as our tree-climbing cousins. Researchers from Boston University filmed the feet of 400 volunteers as they walked barefoot around the Boston Museum of Science. Most humans have stiff arches to help them walk but study found up to one in eight of us share a flexible mid-foot with primates that help them climb trees . They found as many as eight per cent of people have mid-foot flexibility. These people also had a higher than average BMI and flatter feet. But the study authors are unsure whether feature has stayed with some humans over the generations or whether it is a modern phenomenon caused by shoes. Early hominid footprints from 3.5million years ago have been shown to have the same flexibility. Primates flexible feet bends both at the ball and halfway to the heel which helps them hold onto branches . But it was believed that the so-called midtarsal break had disappeared as humans evolved and began walking on two legs. Jeremy DeSilva and Simone Gill, writing in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, that most people had no idea their feet were any difference, even though it was obvious to the naked eye. DeSilva told the New Scientist: 'I was, and continue to be, surprised by this.' The study found that people with the midtarsal break had significantly flatter feet than average. Primates, such as chimpanzees, have a . more flexible mid-foot that is useful for climbing trees and bends both . at the ball and half way to the heel. Humans have a rigid mid-foot - between the ball and heel - that acts as a lever for walking. Crompton . believes that the same flexibility can be shown in the feet of most . people and is actually a useful trait that adds stability when humans . change speed. But DeSilva told the New Scientist that he thinks it is a hindrance to walking efficiently. He said: 'My guess is that we are getting more variation than ever before, perhaps because shoes have impacted foot anatomy.","Researchers from University of Boston filmed 400 people walking barefoot .

A female soldier has revealed how she was raped by a sergeant at a Japanese Marine base after he spiked her drink. Stacey Thompson, 32, who has decided to go public with the story after 14 years, reported the heinous crime to her superiors, but was shocked by their reaction. The man was allowed to leave the Marine Corps and Thomspon, who was 19 at the time, was kicked out after a separate . investigation for drug use stemming from that night. Going public: Stacey Thompson has revealed how she was raped by her sergeant at a Japanese Marine base after he spiked her drinks 14 years go . Now, 14 years later, she has decided to . speak out again, emboldened by the mounting pressure on the Pentagon to . resolve its growing sexual assault epidemic. Thompson is among the scores of service members who have lived in silence for decades and are now stepping forward to fight for an overhaul of the military's justice system and demand their own cases be re-examined. Speaking out: The 19-year-old lance corporal was not afraid to report the crime but paid heavily for doing so . 'To see that what happened to me 14 years ago is still continuing to happen now, for me that was a big reason why I felt the need to come forward,' she said. 'I can finally say I have the strength.' Thompson had just been stationed at . Marine base in Japan when she said her sergeant laced her drinks with . drugs, raped her in his barracks and then dumped her onto a street . outside a nightclub at 4 a.m. The 19-year-old lance corporal was not afraid to report the crime but paid heavily for doing so. The investigator called her a liar, . and military authorities checked her hands for needle pricks after . accusing her of using drugs. She said she never used drugs. She was reassigned to another unit, . removed from her job and told to report to an office, where she had . nothing to do for months, before she was kicked out. She continues to suffer from her . other-than-honorable discharge, which stripped her of her benefits and . she believes has led to her missing out on Defense Department jobs. 'I felt the Marine Corps re-victimized me again after getting raped,' said the 32-year-old mother of three. Thompson said she shut down after getting out, refusing to talk about her rape. She was afraid of men, especially Marines. To this day, she keeps her dog nearby . when she showers and sleeps with lights on in her house, even when her . combat Marine husband is home. 'That fear is still with me 14 years later,' she said. Retaliation: A Pentagon report released earlier this month found 62 percent of sexual assault victims in the military who reported being attacked say they faced some kind of retaliation afterward . But the fight is there too. Thompson . requested her records in December. She said they showed the drug use . allegations against her came from her perpetrator's friends. Retaliation is part of a military-wide pattern that has prevented countless cases from being reported and investigated, exacerbating the epidemic, according to victims' advocates. A Pentagon report released earlier this month found 62 percent of sexual assault victims in the military who reported being attacked say they faced some kind of retaliation afterward. 'It's an ongoing problem that is not getting better, it's getting worse, as the latest statistics out of the Pentagon show,' said Brian Purschia, spokesman for Protect Our Defenders, which has been helping Thompson. 'Unfortunately commanders are conflicted: When a sexual assault occurs on their watch, it reflects poorly on them and that's why it's shoved under the rug. The perpetrators frequently out rank the victims, which is also why there is this bias. They're going to trust people they've known - not an 18 or 19-year-old just new to the service.' 'It's an ongoing problem that is not . getting better, it's getting worse, as the latest statistics out of the . Pentagon show' Brian Purschia, spokesman for Protect Our . Defenders . Thompson said military culture will not change until the system changes. She will speak Friday at a news conference in Los Angeles with Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., to show her support for her bipartisan bill that would put the cases in the hands of military trained prosecutors. Service members now must report any crimes to the chain of command, even when their superiors have been involved. 'Too many survivors of military sexual assault are afraid to report these crimes because they fear retaliation, and they don't believe they will get justice,' Boxer said. 'They deserve a system that encourages victims to come forward knowing that the perpetrators will be brought to justice.' Thompson is now appealing her case to the Department of Veterans Affairs and is seeking compensation related to military sexual trauma. After that, she plans to also appeal her discharge status to get it upgraded to honorable. Several service members have filed lawsuits in the past two years, alleging retaliation after they reported being raped. Among them was another former Marine, Elle Helmer, who said in her lawsuit that after reporting her sexual assault in 2006, the military investigated her for public intoxication and unbecoming conduct. She left the military soon after. 'God's will:' Former US Army Sgt. Rebekah Havrilla testified that she was raped by another service member while serving in Afghanistan. When she sought counseling from an Army chaplain, she said, 'he told me that the rape was God's will' Silenced: Brian Lewis (left) said he was raped . in 2000 while he served in the Navy by a non-commissioned officer who . outranked him. His commanders ordered him not to report the crime. Anu . Bhagwati (right) a former Marine officer, said one in three convicted . offenders remain in the service . Marine Corps and Navy officials declined to comment, saying they do not discuss specific cases. The Marine Corps has said it takes sexual assault allegations seriously and continues to improve in responding to and preventing rapes within the ranks. All branches have been implementing sexual assault prevention programs in the past year. The extent of the assaults came to light when the Pentagon released a report earlier this month estimating that as many as 26,000 military members may have been sexually assaulted last year and that thousands of victims are unwilling to come forward despite new oversight and assistance programs. That figure is an increase over the 19,000 estimated assaults in 2011. Only 3,374 of these crimes were reported, resulting in just 238 convictions. The Senate Armed Services Committee will hold a hearing next week on legislation to combat military sexual assault, including the bill sponsored by Boxer and other lawmakers. Earlier this year Rebekah Havrilla, a former Army . sergeant, told a Senate panel on Wednesday that she encountered a . 'broken' military criminal justice system after she was raped by another . service member while serving in Afghanistan. When . she sought counseling from an Army chaplain, 'he told me that the rape . was God's will and that God was trying to get my attention so that I . would go back to church,' she said. There were nearly 800 reports of sexual assault cases in the Air Force last year, ranging from inappropriate touching to rape. That is a nearly 30 per cent increase from 2011, when 614 cases were reported.

Millie has a protein deficiency, which causes her blood to clot quicker and leads to a higher risk of strokes . Further tests discovered the youngster has a protein deficiency, which causes her blood to clot quicker and leads to a higher risk of strokes. Most strokes occur when a blood clot blocks one of the arteries (blood vessels) that carries blood to the brain. Ms Kidd, from Waterlooville, Hants, said: 'I was absolutely shocked and stunned when I was told the news. 'I never even realised children could have strokes. 'My dad had a stroke in March last year at the age of 54, and I remember thinking he wasn’t old enough to have a stroke. He was overweight and it was a contributing factor. 'He was going into work with slurred speech, before he went to hospital. 'But even though Millie had slurred speech for 48 hours, I never made the connection.' Luckily, Millie’s stroke caused no lasting damage and she now takes tablets to thin her blood. Millie said: 'I was scared and quite upset, I didn’t know what to do, if to worry or cry. I understood about strokes a bit because of my grandad, but I was still scared. Young stroke survivors’ charity Different Strokes have been supporting Millie’s family following the shock diagnosis. Dr Amanda Freeman, a consultant paediatrician at the Queen Alexandra Hospital, said: 'Children usually have a stroke because they have an underlying health problem. 'With adults, it can be due to high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes or high cholesterol. 'The outlook for children is better than adults, and we’d tell any parents who suspect there is a problem to visit their GP straight away.'","Millie Kidd was 'slurring like a drunk person', says mother Lianne .

Victim: Pamela Devitt, 63, pictured, was mauled to death by four pit bulls on May 9 and died on her way to hospital . A California man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after his pack of pit bulls attacked a 63-year-old female jogger, who later died of blood loss from some 200 puncture wounds. Alex Jackson, 29, of Antelope Valley was booked on Thursday after his dogs, caught and impounded following the May 9 attack, tested positive to DNA belonging to victim, Pamela Devitt. He has also been charged with owner negligence, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office. Jackson was initially arrested shortly after Devitt was killed while out for a jog near her home in Littlerock, but was later released on bail pending the DNA test results. He is now being held on more than $1 million bail. According to CBS News, Devitt was 'dragged 50 yards, scalped and her arm removed' by the dogs. The Los Angeles County Coroner later determined she died of 'blood loss attributed to sharp force trauma.' 'The sharp force trauma was caused by the dog attack in which the victim sustained approximately 150 to 200 puncture wounds,' said Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department Lt. John Corina. Corina said a driver saw pit bulls attacking Devitt in the high . desert community of Littlerock. The driver called 911 and honked her . horn to try to get the dogs to stop. An arriving deputy saw a single dog . still attacking the runner and tried to chase it off, Corina . said. The dog ran off into the desert, then turned around and attacked . the deputy, who took a shot at the animal before it ran off. Hours later, sheriff's and animal . control officials served a search warrant on Jackson's home near the . site of the attack and took away eight dogs, six pit bulls and two . mixed-breeds. Impounded: Eight dogs in total have been impounded from a nearby home. Alex Jackson was initially arrested then released before being arrested again on May 30 . Vicious: DNA evidence proved four of the dogs carried out the violent attack . The dogs were kept under quarantine . for rabies observation at a Lancaster shelter. Four of the pit bulls . seized were believed to have attacked Devitt. 'Further examination of the pit bulls revealed they had what appeared to be blood on their coats and muzzles,' Corina told CBS. Since January, authorities received . at least three other reports of Jackson's dogs attacking other people, . according to Robeson. Jackson is also facing several charges related to . growing marijuana. Devitt's husband earlier told KCAL-TV he blamed the dogs' owners for what happened. 'I . do not blame the dogs. I don't blame pit bulls,' Ben Devitt said. 'I . blame people who don't take responsibility for their animals.' Attacked: Pamela Devitt was killed by the pack of dogs while jogging near her home in Littlerock . Not . all of the dogs are licensed, spayed or neutered as required by county . and state law, said Marcia Mayeda, the county's animal control director. In . one of the state's most famous dog mauling cases, a San Francisco . husband and wife were charged in the death of a neighbor in 2001. Marjorie Knoller received a 15-years-to-life sentence. In . rejecting her appeal, the California Supreme Court ruled that Knoller . acted with a conscious disregard for human life when her 140-pound Presa . Canario escaped and killed Diane Whipple in an apartment building . hallway. Knoller's husband, Noel, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. According to authorities, Pamela Devitt died from her wounds on the way to hospital. Following . the deadly attack, police warned residents in the city of Littlerock, . about 40 miles northeast of the city of Los Angeles, to be wary. Horrifying: Los Angeles County Animal Care and Control and Sheriff personnel congregate near the area where a 63-year-old female jogger was attacked and killed by four pit bulls in Palmdale, California . Tony Bell, spokesman for Los Angeles . County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, told NBC4 at the time how . dangerous pit bulls could be. 'These pit bulls are a killing . machines. They're different than other animals. They need to have . enhanced enforcement on these particular animals,' he said. Sheriff's . officials used a helicopter to search for the dogs. 'In these areas, you might have a situation where people dump animals out in rural areas,' said John Mlynar, a spokesman for the nearby city of Palmdale. He added that he'd never heard of an attack like that of May 9. Residents who live near the site of the attack said stray dogs are constantly roaming the area and have attacked people before. 'It's really scary,' Diane Huffman, of Littlerock, told KABC-TV. 'I don't know what to think.

She tipped the scales at 29 stone but ignored warnings she was too obese to conceive. The healthcare support worker continued . to try for a baby with husband Colin, 42, even though her size meant she . was not producing eggs. Kelly Hoyles spent 12 years trying to conceive due to the fact she weighed 29 stone. After shedding 12 stone following gastric band surgery, she gave birth to triplets Freddie, Bella & Jack (l-r) Mrs Hoyles says she was in denial about her weight and ignored medical warnings she was too obese to conceive . Mrs Hoyles eventually admitted she needed help and went to her doctor to ask for a gastric band in January 2008. She underwent the operation on the NHS in November that year and shed an incredible 12 stone over the next three-and-a-half years. A doctor gave her tablets to stimulate her ovaries last May and Mrs Hoyles was stunned when she became pregnant two months later in July. The couple were then told they were having triplets at her eight-week scan. After an uncomplicated pregnancy, .

'I had the gastric band operation in November 2008 and I went back to the hospital in January last year and said I've lost all this weight. 'Everything came back clear except I wasn't ovulating, so I went on Clomid tablets which stimulate your ovaries. 'And two months later I fell pregnant. When I found out, I didn't believe it. I thought it was my body playing tricks on me. 'I did three tests and they all came back positive but I still couldn't believe it until my eight-week scan. 'It wasn't until I saw the pictures on the screen that I believed it. But then the sonographer turned around and said 'you're having triplets'. I can't repeat what I said. I was just in shock.' The multiple births meant that Mrs Hoyles, from Boston, Lincolnshire, had to wait before she could properly meet her three new babies. A doctor gave Mrs Hoyles tablets to stimulate her ovaries last May. The couple were delighted when they discovered they were having triplets Freddie, Jack and Bella at the eight-week scan . After an uncomplicated pregnancy, Mrs Hoyles gave birth to Freddie, Jack and Bella seven-and-a-half weeks early on February 26 this year . A lack of cots at the neo-natal unit in Nottingham meant one baby was whisked off to Sheffield while the other two were sent to Derby. Mr Hoyles, who works as a night manager for a food supplier, spent time visiting the trio while his wife recovered. Mrs Hoyles was eventually reunited with her babies when they were five-days-old and the family were allowed to go home exactly two weeks later. She added: 'It was quite traumatic for the first night. 'I was taken into intensive care and lost two litres of blood. I had to have an emergency Caesarean as I got an infection. 'As they arrived early, there were not enough cots spare at the neo-natal unit to take them, so they were shipped off. With the triplets now home, the couple now get through a staggering 140 nappies and 168 bottles of milk a week . 'I met Bella and Jack for a matter of minutes before they were rushed away. I didn't get to meet Freddie for five days. 'The babies were home at just 19-days-old because they were doing so well. 'They are completely healthy, they are growing really well. 'It's still a bit surreal. I'm still shocked now. Sometimes I look at them and think I can't believe it.'Sometimes it feels like a mad house but they are a lot of fun.'

A mother of four died after ten different doctors over 11 months failed to spot that she had cancer, an inquest heard. Victoria Wyers-Roebuck, 41, was diagnosed with tonsillitis when she complained of a sore throat. It was only after her death that the rare nasal cancer was diagnosed. Coroner Ian Smith criticised the NHS over its failure to recognise the condition and what he described as ‘a complete lack of urgency’. Victoria Jane Wyers-Roebuck, 41, (with daughter Katie) died after 10 different doctors over 11 months failed to spot she had cancer. She was only diagnosed with the disease after her death . The inquest heard how Miss . Wyers-Roebuck, of Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, went to see her local GP . at Norwood Medical Centre in July 2011 complaining of a very sore . throat. She was diagnosed with tonsillitis. Over the next 11 months she . visited the surgery 12 times, seeing a number of different doctors. She also attended Furness General . Hospital six times, including the accident and emergency department, and . was admitted three times. Miss Wyers-Roebuck’s GP, Dr Steve . McQuillan, said that with hindsight if she had been seeing just one . doctor she may have had an earlier referral to see a specialist. He . added: ‘I have been a GP for over 20 years and I suspect continuity of . care was better back then.’ The inquest into her death heard the 'the failure of the NHS system' contributed to Ms Wyers-Roebuck's death. Her GP admitted that had she seen just one doctor when she returned to the surgery, she may have had an earlier referral to a specialist . Miss Wyers-Roebuck’s mother, Paula, . said her daughter had been unhappy with the medical care. ‘All she . wanted to do was to be pain-free and continue living her life without . suffering,’ she said. Her partner, Kevin Nelson, 39, said: ‘Vicky complained of a sore throat . but at no point did she even think it could be cancer. Vicky was let . down by the NHS and doctors, who should have picked it up.’ Miss Wyers-Roebuck had her tonsils . removed at Furness Hospital on May 1, 2012 and they were sent off to be . tested. Because of a backlog at the lab, the results did not come back . until after Miss Wyers-Roebuck had died on June 20 from organ failure . brought on by the disease. The surgeon, Mohammad Yuseff Main, . blamed himself for not chasing up the results. He said new guidelines . meant all results were chased up after two weeks. The coroner said there had been ‘a . lack of continuity’ at the GPs’ surgery and the hospital. ‘They all just . got a bit of the picture rather than the whole picture,’ said Mr Smith. ‘This is the failure of the NHS system not an individual. The chief executive of Furness General Hospital (pictured) said she was 'truly sorry' and that elements of Mrs Wyers-Roebuck's care 'should have been done differently' ‘There is a complete lack of urgency . about the system sometimes.’ He recorded a verdict of death by natural . causes. The hearing at Furness Magistrates’ Court heard that the cancer . was so rare there have been only 12 cases in eight years in the north of . England. Jackie Daniel, the chief executive of . the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, which . is responsible for Furness Hospital, said the organisation was ‘truly . sorry’ and that elements of Miss Wyers-Roebuck’s care ‘should have been . done differently’. ‘Following her death, we carried out . an internal review of her care to understand what happened.

A mother pregnant with twins has spoken movingly about her emotional journey after one baby died during pregnancy – but may have saved her twin sister's life in doing so. Kerry Carruthers, 32, from Truro, Cornwall was 24 weeks pregnant when one of her twin baby girls died following laser surgery to correct twin to twin transfusion syndrome. The condition develops in around 15 per cent of identical twins who share a placenta and blood supply in the womb. Kerry Carruthers lost one one of her twin daughters, Maddison, while pregnant. It was later claimed this saved baby Lucia's life, as the twins had been sharing a placenta. Pictured with older brother Morgan . One gets too little blood and amniotic fluid, which means it cannot grow very well. Between 80 and 90 per cent of babies die if the condition is not treated. One of Ms Carruthers’ babies died in the womb during the procedure and to save the life of the other, she faced the heartbreak of carrying her dead baby until she went into labour naturally. But despite her devastating news, she says carrying the twin – later named Maddison – for six weeks over Christmas and New Year was a privilege as she got to 'keep her close', while she came to terms with her loss and prepared for a birth and a funeral. Her surviving daughter, Lucia, was given a one in 500,000 chance but was born healthy. Ms Carruthers said:  ‘It was utterly devastating to learn one of my twins had died. But even though I was shocked when I was told I would have to carry her until I went into labour, I was also relieved. It may sound strange but I wasn’t ready to say goodbye to her. ‘I felt privileged to have more time with her to come to terms with my loss before she was born and as my bump continued to grow I planned for a funeral and a birth. ‘It was heartbreaking picking a coffin for one daughter and a cot for the other, but I still bought them the same blankets and teddies because I loved them equally. ‘I got to spend one Christmas with Maddison in my tummy as nature intended and for that I consider myself fortunate. Other mums who lose babies do not get the chance to hold them close until they are ready to say goodbye as I did.’ Baby Lucia in intensive care when she was first born, nine weeks early (and right, with Morgan). The twins had been suffering from twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome and Maddison had died in the womb six weeks earlier . Ms Carruthers was delighted to discover at 18 weeks that she was carrying twin girls. But there was bad news at 23 weeks when following another scan her twins were diagnosed with suffering from twin to twin transfusion syndrome, a condition that only affects identical twins. The blood flow from their shared placenta wasn’t divided equally which meant one twin wasn’t getting enough blood and her organs were struggling. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome develops in around 15 per cent of . identical twins who share a placenta and blood supply in the womb. One gets too little blood and amniotic fluid, which means it cannot grow very well. The other gets too much of both, so its heart and circulation struggle . to cope. This twin often squashes the other against the wall of the . womb. Between 80 and 90 per cent of babies die if TTTS is not treated, and . those who live are likely to have heart or kidney problems or serious . neurological problems, such as cerebral palsy. The laser ablation procedure has recently been approved for use in the . UK to treat TTTS. Although the surgery is risky, the procedure has . greatly improved the chances for twins with the syndrome. The other baby was getting too much, putting pressure on her heart, and both of their lives were at risk. In the days that followed the condition became progressively worse and she was offered a termination. She said: ‘I asked the doctors to be honest and they said the situation was so serious they didn’t expect either of my babies to survive. I was devastated. ‘But I insisted no matter how bad it was termination was not an option. My babies deserved a chance.’ The consultant explained the only hope was laser surgery to try to even out the blood supply. Ms Carruthers was awake while it was performed and watched her babies on a screen throughout. She said: ‘The surgeon warned that if either began to struggle or even died during the operation the surgery would continue as it was vital to the survival of the other baby. ‘My heart was hammering and my eyes were fixed on the screen the whole time. They were wriggling and yawning and so unaware of the danger they were in. It was so detailed I could even see they both had blonde hair. It was heartbreaking.’ When the procedure was complete the surgeon confirmed that both babies were still alive. ‘I was utterly relieved, but I knew we weren’t out of the woods,' said Ms Carruthers. She woke the next morning with a terrible feeling that something was wrong. ‘Call it mother’s intuition, but I just knew something terrible had happened. I drove straight to the hospital.’ Ms Carruthers said: 'It was heart-breaking picking a coffin for one daughter and a cot for the other but I still bought them the same blankets and teddies because I loved them equally' Five weeks after her birth in January 2011, weighing 3lb 2oz, a healthy Lucia was allowed home . A scan confirmed her worst fear. One of her babies had died. ‘Tears rolled down my face as I looked at the monitor. One baby lay lifeless at the bottom of the screen while my other twin kicked and wriggled around her.’ It was then that she was told the only chance of saving her surviving twin was to carry her dead twin until she went into labour naturally or reached term. ‘I was shocked but also relieved. I wasn’t ready to say goodbye to my girl. It meant I could be her mummy and keep her close while I tried to come to terms with the fact she had died.’ She named the twin that had died Maddison and picked Lucia for her surviving sister. ‘I prayed that Lucia would survive and started to prepare for her arrival. But I also had to prepare to say goodbye to Maddision. ‘It was heartbreaking and surreal planning a funeral and a birth. I loved them both so equally I wanted to do the best for them both.’ ‘It was almost Christmas and people had bought the twins lots of matching outfits. I had to pack one of each set away knowing my baby girl would never get the chance to wear them. On New Year’s Day 2011 Ms Carruthers went into labour – still only 30 weeks pregnant. She said: I was told they needed to take me into theatre for an emergency C-section. But first I wanted to phone the undertakers to let them know. Lucia will be two in January . 'I wanted Maddison to be collected and taken care of as soon as she was born. I wanted her to be taken somewhere private to rest with dignity after all she had been through.’ Four hours later, she woke up in recovery and was handed a picture of her daughter Lucia who weighed 3lb 2oz having been born in the early hours of January 2nd. ‘She was tiny, covered in tubes and wires, but she was alive. I sagged with relief when the midwife assured me she was doing well.’ The midwife also explained that Maddison had been dressed and wrapped in the blanket her mother had bought her and Kerry was offered the chance to see her. ‘I said no because she had already been dead for six weeks. I wanted to remember her as she had been inside me, alive.’ Just 12 days later Ms Carruthers carried her daughter's coffin into the church for a final farewell. ‘Of course it broke my heart but I had to be strong for her sister Lucia and my son Morgan who needed me too,' she said. Five weeks on. Lucia was allowed home. She’s now a happy one year old and one day her mother plans to tell her about her twin. ‘I’ve been told that Maddison dying saved Lucia’s life. I could have lost them both but I’m lucky enough to have one of my daughter’s with me when I feared losing them both. I will always miss Maddison but I know how lucky I am to have Lucia.’","Kerry Carruthers, 32, was 24 weeks pregnant when one twin died following .

A breast cancer survivor has just weeks to live after doctors missed four deadly tumours growing in her brain - despite her repeatedly asking for a scan. Mother-of-two Lindsey Scrimshire, 52, claims that medics at Leicester Royal Infirmary took no action  after she complained of violent headaches in August 2011, following a battle with breast cancer. Mrs Scrimshire, from Leicester, claims that despite repeated requests for a brain scan, she did not have one until last month, where it was revealed she had four cancerous tumours. Lindsay Scrimshire, with husband Mark, has just weeks to live after doctors missed four deadly tumours growing in her brain. The mother-of-two has previously beaten breast cancer . She has now been left to plan her own funeral after being told she has just ‘weeks’ to live. Mrs Scrimshire complained to a nurse she was suffering violent headaches in 2011 after she finished treatment for breast cancer, which included a lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Mrs Scrimshire said: 'I had severe headaches and pain down my shoulder - the side where the breast cancer was. Mrs Scrimshire, 52, had been complaining of violent headaches since August 2011 . 'I asked if I should be scanned to check if it was cancer as I was worried, but she said it was not necessary. 'I was confused as to why I was not given a scan. The pain was such I went to see my GP regularly.' The former customer services supervisor said she had an X-ray in October 2011 and was told by her GP she was suffering from arthritis and was given painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs. Mrs Scrimshire went to Glenfield Hospital for her yearly cancer check-up in February last year.Lindsey said: 'Once again, I told the nurse about my violent headaches and pains.' In the same month she saw her GP and was again told she was suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and given drugs. She also went for an operation to remove a bowel blockage at Leicester Royal Infirmary. Mrs Scrimshire said: 'I told them about my pain and worries but was told a scan was not necessary.' She said she was finally scanned after she went into the accident and emergency department at the Leicester Royal Infirmary on April 22 because the pain was so bad. Her husband, Mark, 47, said: 'A doctor came back with the results and she was crying. She told us Lindsey had four large tumours in her brain and there was nothing they could do but give her palliative care. 'Then a full body scan showed it is in her lungs and liver, too. 'If they had scanned Lindsey when she asked, nearly two years before, or even last year, she might have a chance of at least fighting the cancer.' Mrs Scrimshire said: 'I asked and asked to be scanned but was repeatedly told that it would not be necessary. Staff should have listened to me, but I made the tragic mistake of listening to them' Claire Esler, consultant oncologist and clinical head of service at Leicester’s Hospitals said: 'We are sorry that Lindsey did not receive a scan at her follow up appointment but it was felt at the time the symptoms were not related to the breast cancer. 'Our thoughts are with Lindsey and her family during this time and we have met with them to discuss the treatment options. 'Lindsay’s treatment for breast cancer back in 2011 was completely appropriate and under national guidance we do not scan patients after treatment. We are happy to meet again to discuss any of their concerns.'

Annemarie was diagnosed with cancer two years ago but refused to let the disease conquer her optimism and even wrote a book called Humour with a Tumour. She and Geraint, 47, initially kept the news from their four sons, Zack, 22, Harrison, 18, Harvey, 16, and Roddy, 13, and tried to carry on with life as normally as possible. Annemarie, of Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, rejected the purely medical route and travelled to America in search of other ways to combat her tumour. She later returned for more conventional treatment at a specialist hospital in Cardiff. Earlier this year, realising she did not have long to live, she began writing her life plan for family and friends. Before she died in March, Annmarie wrote: . 'I am so thankful for everything in my life. I like the person I am. I . am thankful for my husband who is also on this journey. As one you can . achieve most things, as two we can achieve anything.

'She loved life and wanted to enjoy all of it for as long as she possibly could.

The parents of a toddler who lost both legs and an arm to meningitis are battling for a new vaccine to be introduced across the UK. Tommy Brown contracted the deadly disease at just five months old. He was given just a five per cent chance of survival after also developing blood poisoning and his heart stopping, meaning doctors had to bring him back from the dead. Now, a year after their ordeal, Tommy's parents Julie and Dean are campaigning for a revolutionary new meningitis vaccine to be made available to children across the NHS. Fourteen-month-old Tommy Brown (with mother Julie, father Dean and sister Ellie) contracted meningitis B at just five months old. He lost both legs, his right arm and the fingers of his left hand and was given just a five per cent chance of survival . Ms Tuckey, 37, said: 'Injuries and all, we prayed Tommy would live. It makes me cry to see him alert and looking about, then looking at where his hands and legs used to be, as if he is wondering where they are. 'It was so painful to see him suffer and go through the operations. But he is remarkable and is superb at adapting, we're lucky to still have our beautiful boy.' The ordeal began when mother-of-four Ms Tuckey, 37, and Tommy's father, Dean Brown, 28, saw their son's temperature skyrocket to over 37C. They took Tommy to his doctor, but his temperature continued to rise and he was eventually diagnosed with a throat infection. But by the morning, the youngster had a purple rash across his body and was rushed to Walsall Manor Hospital, where meningitis and septicaemia were finally diagnosed. Doctors also had to revive him as he technically died in A&E. The family is backing a campaign for a new vaccine to be introduced across the UK. It will protect against meningitis B, the most deadly form that Tommy had . Tommy's parents were then shocked to be told that he would have to lose one of his legs between the knee and ankle. But, after a five-hour operation, he had to have both legs, right hand and left hand fingers amputated in March 2012, followed by painful skin grafts. Ms Tuckey, who has three other children, Elle, 10; Demi, 18 and Lee, 19, said: 'It was a nightmare. I didn't go home for six weeks, I suffered bad dreams every night and spoke to a psychologist to help me cope with things. 'It was hard to see our clever boy, who was starting to move around in his walker, learn to cope without his limbs. 'But we know he will do us proud and achieve whatever he puts his mind to.' He was also dubbed 'the miracle boy' as the hospital told his parents 'we've never known a child so poorly . survive so many amputations, so young'. Marvel: Tommy was dubbed 'the miracle boy' by hospital. His mother Julie said: 'We were told the staff had never known a child so poorly survive so many amputations, so young' Tommy is now learning to walk using his new prosthetic . legs and can even kick a football. The . family are now assisting with the Meningitis UK and Meningitis Trust's . new national Meningitis B: Beat it Now roadshow and petition. The . UK has one of the highest Meningitis B incidence rates in the world, . affecting an average of 1,870 people each year. Meningitis B is the most . deadly form of the condition. One in 10 people affected will die and . one in four will be left with life-changing after-effects such as brain . damage or limb loss. Developed by pharmaceutical giant Novartis, Bexsero would be the first Meningitis B vaccine to be licensed for use in the UK. Hope: Tommy is now learning to walk using his new prosthetic legs and can even kick a football . Next month, the independent Joint . Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises the . Government on vaccination, will suggest whether Bexsero should be in the . childhood immunisation schedule. Meningitis UK and Meningitis Trust is a charity for the research and prevention of the disease and provides support services and after-care for sufferers. Mr Brown said: 'We strongly support the campaign as we don't want anyone else to go through what we have, it still impacts on us now and will for life. 'It's a horrendous disease that kills or leaves people like our Tommy with awful after-effects. 'It's simple - there should be no question - the Government needs to act and put this vaccine on the NHS immediately. 'It will save so many lives and stop others from suffering like Tommy, so everyone should rally behind Beat it Now.'

Angelina Jolie's surgeon has revealed in detail the treatment the 37-year-old actress had before, during and after her preventative mastectomy procedure. The actress made the brave decision to have three months of . secret procedures after being told she had an 87 per cent chance of contracting . breast cancer due to the BRCA1 gene. Angelina is said to already be planning her next surgery - the . removal of both her ovaries - as the gene means she has a 50 per cent chance of . developing ovarian cancer. Now, in a blog post on the Pink Lotus Breast Center website, her surgeon Dr Kristi Funk has explained the different stages of Angelina's medical treatment to help other women seeking information about BRCA gene mutations and what it might . mean for them. Angelina Jolie's surgeon has . revealed in detail the treatment the 37-year-old actress had before, during and after her preventative mastectomy procedure . In a blog post on the Pink Lotus Breast Center website, Angelina's surgeon Dr Kristi Funk (right) has explained the type of nipple sparing surgery and reconstructive treatment she had . Speaking about Angelina's journey and recovery, she said: 'To a . large extent, I believe recovery reflects expectation. Angelina expected . to feel well, to be active. 'On Monday, the pathology returned and I . called Angelina to confirm our biggest hope: all of the breast tissue . was benign. 'On day four after her mastectomies, I was pleased to find . her not only in good spirits with bountiful energy, but with two walls . in her house covered with freshly assembled storyboards for the next . project she is directing. 'All the while she spoke, six drains dangled . from her chest, three on each side, fastened to an elastic belt around . her waist. Dr Funk added: 'It is important to . emphasize that each woman’s case is different. Surgery will not . necessarily be the right choice for everyone, and there are alternatives . available. As Angelina says in her article, the important thing is to . be aware of your options.' The first stage, says Dr Funk, is to gather data and information. 'BRCA stands for BReast CAncer.  BRCA genes help you fight cancer when it . happens in your body. 'Women carrying BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations have up to an 87 per cent lifetime chance of breast cancer and 54 per cent chance of ovarian cancer vs. a general population risk of 12 per cent for breast cancer and less than 1 per cent for ovarian cancer. Dr Funk said that Angelina's partner brad Pitt was on hand to greet her as soon as she came around from the anesthetic, as he was during each of the operations . Speaking about Angelina's journey and recovery, Dr Funk said: 'To a large extent, I believe recovery reflects expectation. Angelina expected to feel well, to be active' 'Given the high likelihood of getting breast or ovarian cancer with BRCA mutations, family history usually triggers testing for the gene. Angelina’s mother had breast cancer, and sadly passed away from ovarian cancer.  Her maternal grandmother was also diagnosed with ovarian cancer.' Women carrying a BRCA mutation then undergo a surveillance plan involving mammograms, breast examinations, pelvic ultrasounds and blood tests to check for CA-125, which is a marker of ovarian cancer.  If and when a woman commits to a preventative mastectomy, there are a number of questions a woman has to address, says Dr Funk. The first is whether or not to preserve the nipples. 'Women undergoing preventive mastectomies can always consider keeping their nipples.' Angelina had a technique called Nipple Delay, performed one to two weeks before the actual mastectomies. This uses the planned mastectomy incision and lifts half of the skin off of the breast surface. 'A small disc of the tissue directly behind the nipple and areola is also removed and analyzed by a pathologist,' says Dr Funk. Angelina's decision to have the preventative mastectomy was prompted by the fact she lost her mother, Marcheline Bertrand (left), to ovarian cancer at the age of 56 . 'This is done to rule out the presence of any disease directly behind the nipples, which would make preserving them a dangerous proposition. Additionally, it recruits extra blood flow to the area, lessening the chances of nipple and skin loss due to insufficient blood supply after the mastectomy.' Angelina was in the operating room for the first . operation, the nipple delay, on February 2, 2013. 'Her partner was on hand to greet her as . soon as she came around from the anesthetic, as he was during each of . the operations,' said Dr Funk. 'After the operation, her skin was slightly . bruised but soon returned to normal.  Two days after her procedure, . great news arrived: the tissue behind both nipples came back completely . normal. 'On February 16, she had the main surgery, which can last . up to eight hours.  The mastectomies went smoothly, with sentinel nodes . identified but not removed.' Dr Funk said Angelia had a procedure called Nipple Delay to preserve her nipples and an implant reconstruction with allograft . When it came to the incisions, 'for Angelina, her optimal incision choices were around the areola, or . underneath the breast in the inframammary fold – the latter was chosen,' says Dr Funk. 'After the mastectomies, I assisted plastic . surgeon, Dr. Jay Orringer, as we performed the first stage breast . reconstruction by placing tissue expanders with allograft. 'Implants are the most common reconstruction, often requiring two stages, . whereby a tissue expander is placed prior to the final implant. 'A . tissue expander is a deflated implant that goes behind the pectoral . muscles and gets slowly inflated with saline over a period of 2-3 . months, until the chosen volume is reached. A second operation is . performed to swap the expander for the final implant (usually silicone). She adds that 'Angelina’s body type was best suited to an implant reconstruction with allograft. 'This uses synthetic sheets of material, that create a more natural look. Although tissue expanders required an additional operation, she preferred to use them. 'The next day she had her first injection of saline . into the expanders, thus beginning the process that would gradually . prepare the tissues for the final stage of her operations, . reconstruction. 'Four of the six drains were removed.  Four days after . that, on postoperative day nine, the last two drains were removed.  A . second saline fill occurred on March 4. Over the next four weeks she was . hard at work. 'The final operation occurred on April 27, 2013, . ten weeks after the mastectomies: reconstruction of the breasts with . implant, which went extremely well, bringing an end to her surgical . journey.' Dr Funk says Angelina also followed a strict regimen of supplements to both prepare and recover from surgery. This included: . To enhance wound healing (for each operation):Vitamin C: 1000mg tablets; one tablet once daily for one week before and one week after surgery.Multi-Vitamin: one tablet once daily for one week before and one week after surgery.Zinc: 50 mg; one tablet once daily for one week before and one week after surgery. To reduce the risk of infection:Bactroban ointment: Applied twice a day beginning 3 days prior to surgery x 7 days.Hibiclens . shower: Hibiclens soap applied to upper torso and abdomen – left on for . 5 minutes, then rinsed. Applied once a day for 3 days prior to surgery.Keflex: 250mg (antibiotic); one tablet 4x a day for 7 days, beginning with 2 doses the day of the operation. To reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting (for each operation):Emend: 40mg; one tablet by mouth the night before surgery . To reduce postoperative swelling and bruising (for each operation):Arnica Forte (Arnica and Bromelain): two capsules daily x 7 days, beginning one day prior to surgery.To help eliminate anesthesia from the system (for each operation):Exchem: . 10 drops in water or directly in the mouth twice daily, beginning the . day before surgery and continuing for one week after surgery. Lymphomyosat: . 10 drops in water or directly in the mouth twice daily, beginning the . day before surgery and continuing for one week after surgery. To increase oxygen to the skin (operations 1 and 2):Cutagenix: . Applied to breast every 6 hours x 3 days. Skin care specialists use . this topical cream after laser resurfacing to increase oxygen flow to . the outer layers of skin. We decided in Angelina’s case to apply it to . the mastectomy skin to give it an oxygen boost and to help ensure . adequate blood flow to her skin postoperatively. To minimise scarring (after operation 3):BioCorneum: Rubbed into scars twice a day for 12 weeks – begin after the third operation once steri strips are removed. Plus various medications needed for pain.","Dr Kristi Funk details Angelina's procedures in a new blog post on the Pink Lotus Breast Center website .

A shameless motorist has had his car seized after running up a staggering £18,000 of parking fines in just over a year. The mystery driver was ticketed 220 times in different spots around a city centre after repeatedly parking without ever paying or displaying a permit. After each fine was ignored, officials have now lost patience and impounded the 13-year-old light blue Peugeot 206. But the £18,000 debt is far more than the £15,000 a brand new one would cost, and as this vehicle is more than a decade old it is worth substantially less. Clampdown: This is the moment a shameless motorist's Peugeot 206 was seized after they ran up £18,000 of fines in a year - substantially more than the car is worth . The saga began when the car, which is registered to a man, was first issued with a parking ticket in Portsmouth, Hampshire, on February 20, 2012. The driver then went on to park in a host of city council car parks and streets where a permit is required. When repeated efforts by Portsmouth City Council and contracted bailiffs to contact the owner failed, the hatchback was finally clamped and seized. The council used its parking enforcement powers to take the car as the owner failed to pay after three penalty notices and made no effort to get in touch. Vehicles removed by the council can be destroyed if the owner doesn't make contact and pay outstanding fines, including removal and storage fees. Pledge: Portsmouth City Council (pictured) say they will pursue the unnamed driver through the courts to get the cash . Cllr Jason Fazackarley, Portsmouth City Council's cabinet member for traffic and transportation, explained why they seized the car. He said: 'This is an extreme case which is why we have taken the necessary action to seize the vehicle after a blatant disregard by the owner. In addition to seizing the vehicle we will pursue legal action to recover the outstanding debt owned.' Michael Robinson, Portsmouth City Council's parking manager, insisted the council will continue to pursue the owner until they pay back the 18,000 pounds. He said: 'Although the car has been seized we won't give up pursuing the owner until they come forward and the outstanding debt is settled. 'The amount of fines this motorist ran up shows a lack of respect for all road users, so we used our enforcement powers to take action against this persistent offender.'","Portsmouth parker has refused to pay or show permit since February 2012 .

This is the dramatic moment police stormed a plane and bundled a man away amid fears a flight arriving in Britain was a hijacking target because he allegedly 'threatened to blow it up'. A terrified passenger filmed officers escorting the man to the front of the Boeing 777 plane, carrying 308 passengers, which had been due to land at Manchester but then was diverted to Stansted after a terror alert. After the captain activated an emergency signal, two RAF Typhoon fighter jets raced through the skies to meet the Pakistan International Airlines plane following reports two men ‘tried to get into the cockpit’. The incident happened in the febrile atmosphere following the Woolwich murder of soldier Lee Rigby, 25, last Wednesday, so the authorities decided to take no chances. Armed officers from Essex Police boarded the Boeing 777 and arrested two British men. PIA Flight PK709 was carrying 297 passengers and 11 crew on the 13-hour flight from Lahore in Pakistan to Manchester. Passenger Umari Nauman said: ‘The cabin crew informed us that basically they tried to come into the cockpit a few times and because they had been asked not to do that they got into a bit of an argument with the crew and made a few threats.’ Captain Nadeem Sufi reported to his bosses at PIA’s headquarters in Pakistan that, 30 minutes before landing, crew members told him that two passengers had threatened ‘to blow up the flight after a heated conversation’. The captain reportedly said: ‘As soon as crew told me, I raised the alarm to air traffic control.’ He sent out what is known as a ‘squawk 7700’ – an emergency code transmitted by a radio transponder signalling the aircraft is in peril.

Thousands of people living in Britain could be 'on the path' to becoming violent radicals and terrorists, the Home Secretary said today. Theresa May gave the warning as she confirmed a fresh crackdown on extremist groups who could be a threat to national security. The senior Tory also used an interview on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show to criticise the Corporation for interviewing radical cleric Anjem Choudary. He was given star billing on a discussion panel with Newsnight presenter Kirsty Wark, as he insisted he was not a ‘hate preacher’ or Islamic extremist. Refusing to condemn the killers of Lee Rigby, the British drummer crushed by a vehicle and then hacked to death with machetes, Choudary even suggested that ‘one man killed in a street’ was hardly proper vengeance for those killed by ‘Britain and the U.S.’ in wars overseas. Mrs May said: 'I think Anjem Choudary has disgusting views and I think it is right that we look at how those views are being presented and I think there were many people who did indeed say ""What is the BBC doing interviewing Anjem Choudary?"" After his appearance two days ago, the BBC was branded 'idiotic' and 'insensitive'. Around 500 police and security officers are working on the 'horrific murder' of soldier Lee Rigby, Mrs May also revealed. But despite more arrests linked to the killing overnight, she said 'all the indications' pointed to a lone wolf style incident rather than a wider planned operation. Asked if she believed there were thousands at risk of radicalisation in the UK, she replied 'potentially'. 'We have people at different points on what could be the path to violent extremism,' she said. Hero: Father Lee Rigby, 25, was executed by two suspected Islamic terrorists in Woolwich on Wednesday afternoon and has prompted calls for a crackdown on dangerous groups . She added that the Government 'Prevent' scheme designed to reduce radicalism in Britain had spoken to 2,000 people at risk in the past year, particularly in prison. Mrs May also suggested a lower limit for imposing banning orders on extremist groups could be introduced. She told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: 'We do need to look at the powers, we do need to look at the laws. 'We do need to look, for example, at the question of whether perhaps we need to have banning orders to ban organisations that don't meet the threshold for proscription.' Tighter rules could also be imposed on internet service providers, the Home Secretary suggested.She added: 'One of the issues we need to look at is whether we have got the right processes, the right rules in place in relation to what is being beamed into people's homes.' Mrs May defended the 'excellent' work of the security and intelligence agencies in the face of claims mistakes were made in the handling of the two suspects, identified as Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, who were known MI5. Messages: Anjem Choudary at a demonstration in 2007, with alleged Woolwich killer Michael Adebojalo behind him . Criticised: Anjem Choudary was asked onto Newsnight this week, where he was interviewed by Kirsty Wark, a decision which has been widely panned . A childhood friend of Adebolajo has also claimed that the suspect was approached by MI5 six months ago and asked if he would work for the security service. Mrs May refused to be drawn on the details of the case but said said the security services worked in a 'variety of ways. They will approach individuals from time to time,' she said. Detectives have made three further arrests in connection with the brutal killing. Two men, aged 24 and 28, were detained at an address in south-east London yesterday, while a 21-year-old man was arrested in the street in Charlton Lane, Greenwich, all on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. Police from the Counter Terrorism Command, supported by specialist firearms officers, used Tasers to detain two of them, the 21 and 28-year-old. They did not need hospital treatment. Mrs May also insisted the failed 'snooper's charter' would be revived as she appeared to be gearing up for a fight with Liberal Democrats. Earlier this month Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg blocked the Home Secretary's plans for a communications bill that would have given police and security services access to records of individuals' internet use. Row: Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson said that Theresa May should resign if she cannot push through laws that allow the authorities to snoop on what people look at online . Labour former Home Secretary Alan Johnson said today he was 'absolutely passionately' a supporter of reforms and suggested it was a resigning issue for Theresa May if she could not get the changes into law by 2015. Asked whether she would quit over the matter, Mrs May told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: 'I have made my view very clear. We are now working through across the government what action we can take but I'm clear, the law enforcement agencies, the intelligence agencies need access to communications data and that is essential to them doing their job.' The Home Secretary said there was a reference to the plans in the Queen's Speech. She added: 'I have always been clear that access to communications data is essential for law enforcement agencies and the intelligence agencies. 'There is a reducing capability in relation to access to communications data.'","Theresa May says 500 police investigating murder of Lee Rigby in Woolwich .

Travellers are finally fleeing the infamous Dale Farm site they fought for more than a decade to defend as they say the former greenbelt site is contaminated with raw sewage. Dale Farm residents had fought a 10-year legal battle with Basildon Council in Essex to defend their right to live illegally on the six-acre site in Crays Hill, Essex. Hundreds of police and bailiffs were mobilised in October 2011 as part of a £7.1million eviction but despite the costly action a large number of touring caravans continued to line the road leading into the site. 'Filthy': A line of caravans parked along an access road near the Dale Farm camp, which has allegedly become rat-infested and covered in excrement . Action: Travellers and protesters manoeuvre a caravan to block a road during the eviction of Dale Farm last year, as residents complain about conditions there . It is alleged families have no access to toilets which has resulted . in the site becoming infested with rats and covered with human . excrement. Illnesses such as . impetigo, chickenpox and diarrhoea are rife and children have been . struck by bouts of vomiting since the £7.2million eviction operation 12 . months ago, an NHS report said last year. But now travellers are exiting in their droves after suffering health problems due to their poor living conditions. Stuart Hardwicke-Carruthers, a campaigner for the travellers, said: 'Most of them have left. 'The conditions left by the council after the eviction, with raw sewage still leaking, has led to a lot of illness. 'Some have gone to Birmingham and others to Ireland to stay with family. 'They will be coming back though because they can’t stay there indefinitely.' Infamous: The work of police and bailiffs to move in on Dale farm led to protesters setting fire to tyres and wood at their barricades . Row: Dale Farm has been at the heart of a decade-long battle between Basildon Council and travellers . Travellers who had continued to live illegally on the roadside had previously complained of a lack of electricity, running water and toilet facilities. The complaints came despite enforcement notices from the council last July demanding they leave the roadside immediately. The enforcement notices prompted failed appeals to the Planning Inspectorate and High Court although legal action is still believed to be on-going despite the exodus from the site. Refusal: Despite costing the taxpayer £7.1m, people have not all left the area . Councillor Tony Ball, leader of Basildon Council, said: 'The travellers have asked for their application to be heard in open court by another judge. 'We will not take action until the outcome of that.' An Environment Agency report into dangerous contaminants - including asbestos and engine oil - at Dale Farm is expected to be published in the coming months.","Land in Essex has become infamous because of 10-year planning battle .

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 06:32 EST, 30 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:43 EST, 30 May 2013 . The body of April Jones may never be found despite the largest police search in British history. Hundreds of officers and scores of volunteers have scoured the countryside surrounding Machynlleth, mid Wales, since her disappearance to no avail. Child killer Mark Bridger has not even allowed April's parents the dignity of burying their daughter by steadfastly refusing to come clean about exactly what he did with her body. During his trial, the former abattoir worker said he accidentally 'crushed' the five-year-old with his Land Rover but claimed he can't remember what happened afterwards . because he was drunk and panicking. And yet after he was convicted today, it was revealed for the first time that Bridger confessed to a prison priest that he dumped the body into a river. Scroll down for CCTV of Mark Bridger on the day April disappeared . Experts: Police divers search the River Dyfi close to the home of Mark Bridger, whose fast-moving waters MArk Bridger most likely used to dispose of April . The evidence of Father Barry O'Sullivan, who was holding a counselling session with Bridger, was . not told to the jury but can now be revealed after Bridger was convicted . of abduction, murder and perverting the course of justice at Mold Crown Court. For seven months, specialist forces from across the UK have . covered the 'extremely challenging' terrain of the Welsh countryside . surrounding her home town, scouring mountains, gorges, streams and . waterfalls. They battled through awful weather during what proved to be a treacherous winter. An extensive range of resources were . used, including police marine units, experts in searching mines and . confined spaces, fire and rescue and urban search and rescue teams, the . coastguard, mountain rescue and dog teams from across the country. More . than 23 square miles and 300 separate locations have been covered in . total. While the search is now officially finished, officers are on hand . to respond to any new information. Bridger has never revealed what he did with April but many believe he threw her into fast flowing water near his home. The father-of-six was being held at HM Prison Manchester - formerly known as Strangeways - when he made the shocking admission to the prison priest. He had been on suicide watch ahead of his trial and started having regular meetings with priest Barry O'Sullivan. Judge John Griffith Williams told the court: 'It is his evidence that Mark Bridger said to him on one of their meetings he had disposed of April in the river.' The court heard how Bridger was spotted the day after April disappeared near the banks of the River Dyfi carrying a black bin bag 'with something in it'. Hunt: The search for missing April Jones included many people from the town of Machynlleth and the surrounding area in Powys, Mid Wales, who were desperate to find her . Thorough: Officers searched 32sq km of Welsh countryside, including rivers, forests and fields but have never found her . Mother-of-three Carwen Sheen was one of the hundreds of people out searching for little April when she saw Bridger holding the black bag, the jury heard. She told the court: 'I knew Mark Bridger and saw him that morning. 'We were searching the side roads along a narrow back road between Ceinws and Machynlleth. 'I was driving with two friends when I saw Bridger's vehicle pulled up on the side of an overgrown hill. 'The engine was left on and the driver's side door was open. 'I slowed down to pass his car and saw him coming down the bank holding a black bin bag. I would say there was something in the bag not very big, but something in it. Following April's disappearance the waters near her home were searched by police divers and specialist canoeist. April disappeared on October 1 last year and despite the biggest search in British criminal history her body has never been found . But she was not found in the rivers which were swollen and fast following from recent rain fall. Bridger told a murder trial jury he was a Christian who had 'church friends' who tried to help him through his alcoholism. After his arrest on suspicion of murder he took advantage of the Prison chaplaincy service offered by the Diocese of Salford. The hunt for the schoolgirl was the UK's biggest ever operation of . its kind but failed to find her. Search teams, which included distraught locals, covered thousands of acres of rugged land, forests . and deep river water in a desperate attempt to find April since she went . missing on October 1 from outside her home in Machynlleth, mid Wales. But after searches of all key areas were completed, April's . parents were given the heartbreaking news that they may never get to say . goodbye to their daughter. The effort to return April to her family, code named Operation Tempest, lasted almost eight months and involved 17 police teams scouring 32sq km of Welsh countryside. The terrain of winding rivers, mountainous valleys and deep mine shafts and caves, made it a 'unique challenge', the officer who led Tempest said. Around 16,000 officer search days were dedicated to finding April, involving police from 47 forces across the UK, and volunteers from around the world. He said it was the largest deployment of UK officers since the Lockerbie disaster. Riverbank: A team walk the banks of a river during the eight month search, the biggest in British history . Inspector Gareth Thomas, the search coordinator for Dyfed-Powys Police, said: 'The driving force for us has always been to find April and reunite her with her family. 'That was the priority right from the start and that's what was motivating all those officers who came to help from all over the country and further afield.' He said due to the fact that Bridger painted himself as an 'Andy McNab or Bear Grylls wannabe' that meant he could have had intimate knowledge of area, making every cave, stream, mineshaft, ditch and quarry a search area. Mr Thomas said it was with 'immense disappointment' that the search was concluded last month. 'During the course of the search I honestly believed that we would find April, it's an immense disappointment that we have been unable to return April to her family,' he added. 'We can't think of any worst case scenario.' The search began on the night of October 1 last year with a handful of concerned neighbours on the Bryn-y-Gog estate, soon joined by hundreds of members of the public who came from far and wide as word spread on social and news media. No avail: This group of volunteer Kayakers and mountain rescue experts joined the search upstream from Machynlleth town . Water: A hovercraft search and rescue team on the River Dovey estuary as they were not sure if April may have been swept out to sea after being dumped in a river . The realisation, following Mark Bridger's arrest, that April would not be found alive was shattering news for all involved. Detective superintendent Andy John, the senior investigating officer, said: 'There was a feeling of extreme disappointment because everybody approached the investigation from the outset in the hope that we were going to find April safe and well.' Describing the reaction of April's parents, Paul and Coral, he added: 'Obviously, on receiving that terrible, terrible news they were extremely traumatised. 'They needed a huge amount of support. 'The vast majority of people could never begin to imagine what they have had to go through and continue to go through because, as we all know they still haven't had their daughter or their daughter's remains returned to them.' Emotion en masse: Hundreds take to the streets of Machynlleth on their way to a church service for missing five-year-old April Jones in the days after she disappeared . Mr John said police have not given up hope that one day April's remains will be recovered. 'My message to Mark Bridger is quite clear, he needs to tell Paul and Coral Jones, and the family of April what he has done with their daughter,' he said. Mr Thomas added: 'As soon as we have any more intelligence or information we will recommence the search.' Like any other little girl April Jones loved to play out with her friends. And on the night she was snatched by child killer Mark Bridger, April had thrown a 'tantrum' so she could do just that. Her father, Paul Jones, had told her she could not go out to play. But April Jones cried and kept asking to be allowed outside – so eventually Paul and his wife Coral gave in. Brave: Paul and Coral Jones, the parents of April Jones arrive at Mold Crown Court, where they have been every day during their daughter's killer's murder trial . Less than 20 minutes later she was gone, never to be seen again. Coral Jones said she and her husband had both told April it was too late to go outside on her little pink bike.In her statement to police, Mrs Jones said: 'She kept on and on and had a little bit of a tantrum.' 'We eventually gave in. I zipped up her coat and she went off to play outside with her friend. I told her I didn't want her to be long. I think that was around 7pm. This was the last time I saw her.' Mrs Jones said that at about 7.20pm it was getting dark and colder, and she wanted April to come back inside. Tragic: DC Fred Hunter with April Jones' bike (right) and a bike that was being ridden by her best friend (left) on the night she went missing . He father said she was pleading to be allowed out to play with her best friend after watching the film but they told her it was too late. 'She had a little paddy,' he said. 'I suppose we just gave in and she was told she could only go out for a short while,' he added. The couple said April knew about 'stranger danger' and would never have got into a car with someone she did not know. Mr Jones said he had known Bridger since about 1992 when the defendant was dating the sister of his then girlfriend. He said: 'I can't think of any reason why Mark Bridger would take April, he is a father too. I don't understand why he would do this to her.' Despite the family's anguish, Bridger has continued to refuse to ease their suffering by telling them what he did with their daughter's body.","Operation Tempest involved 17 police teams scouring 32sq km countryside .

Prince Philip was forced to withdraw from an official engagement yesterday after falling ill on the eve of a service to mark the 60th anniversary of the Queen’s coronation. The Duke of Edinburgh, who turns 92 on Monday, had been due to join the Queen last night at a gala reception for the Royal National Institute of Blind People at St James’s Palace. Prince Philip has not been taken to hospital and was staying overnight at Buckingham Palace, where a spokesman had no details of his illness - but said he was expected to be at the service today.

Hours ahead of the Queen's Diamond . Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace last June, Prince Philip was . hospitalised with a bladder infection and unable to attend the rest of her celebrations. At tonight’s event the Queen enjoyed performances by West End star Michael Ball and operatic quartet Il Divo. Ball sang People, from the musical Funny Girl. ‘I thought it appropriate for the event,’ he said before the reception. ‘I have sung for the Queen on various occasions, including when we did a version of Les Misérables at Windsor Castle a few years ago to mark the centenary of the Entente Cordiale with France. This is a great cause.’ Il Divo performed a Spanish version of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah. One of the group, Urs Buhler, from Switzerland, said afterwards: ‘It was an unusual performance for us, in such an intimate room. ‘This was the fourth or fifth time we have performed in front of the Queen - we have done the Royal Variety Performance two or three times.’ Another star attending - but not singing . this year, though he has done so at the event before - was Rod Stewart, . with wife Penny Lancaster. Both are vice presidents of RNIB. All smiles: Queen Elizabeth II is presented with a bouquet by Maddie Stone during a reception for the RNIB .

Stewart said he had been suffering from a virus. ‘I'm feeling great and my show at the O2 tomorrow will go ahead,’ he said. ‘I've sung at this event before - mostly the standards, but Maggie May too - and would like to sing here again in the future.’ His wife added: ‘I think it was Rod's performance a few years ago that has sparked all these performances from other artists.’ Downton Abbey creator and RNIB supporter Julian Fellowes said the organisation was a 'shining example of all that is best in the charity sector'. He told the Queen: 'In recognising the work of the charity by your presence you have made us all very proud.' The Queen has been the patron of RNIB since her accession to the throne in 1952.","Prince Philip was due to join Queen last night at a gala reception for RNIB .
