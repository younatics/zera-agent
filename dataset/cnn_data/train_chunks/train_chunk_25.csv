"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- About 1.6 million fans registered for a chance at fewer than 9,000 pairs of tickets to Michael Jackson's memorial service next week, organizers said. Some memorial tickets went out to ""friends and family"" on Sunday. Registration ended at 6 p.m. Saturday. Officials will now ""scrub"" all entries to eliminate duplicates and those they suspect may have been registered using software that ticket scalpers use to generate multiple hits. A random drawing will follow. The winning 8,750 registrants will receive an e-mail Sunday after 11 a.m. (2 p.m. ET), AEG Live said. ""I know I'll be hitting the 'refresh' button on my inbox over and over again,"" said Jackie Flower, an arts student in San Diego, California. The e-mail will assign the selected registrants a unique code and direct them to a designated distribution center away from the Staples Center. There, they will each receive two tickets to either the memorial service at the Staples Center arena or a simulcast of the event at the adjacent Nokia Theater LA Live, AEG said. Jackson's family has still not announced the singer's burial arrangements, saying only that it will hold a private ceremony ahead of the massive public memorial service Tuesday. Journalists staked out several possible burial locations. A long line of television satellite trucks remained parked outside the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn Cemetery in case it was chosen by the family, but there has been no word from cemetery officials. Police set up metal barricades around the front lawn, creating spaces for media and fans. Two state trooper cruisers idled at the Hall of Liberty inside the grounds, which contains a 1,200-seat auditorium.   Watch reporters prepare for Tuesday's service » . The family has not decided whether Jackson's body will be brought to the Staples Center arena, where the public ceremony will be held at 10 a.m. PT. At the time of his death, Jackson was working with a concert promotions company on 50 sold-out shows in London, England, beginning in mid-July. Also Saturday, a handful of fans milled about the Jackson family home in Encino, California, bringing flowers and taking pictures next to an informal sidewalk shrine to the pop star. Farzana Payind of Los Angeles snapped a picture of her 6-year-old daughter, Enayah. Payind said Enayah loves to dance to Jackson songs ""Billie Jean"" and ""Thriller"" and cried when she learned of the singer's death. ""Does that mean his music died too?"" the girl asked, according to Payind. Neighbor Michael Singer watched the activities with interest. ""This makes Elvis look like nothing,"" he said. ""When you grow up with Michael Jackson's music pretty much your whole life, you feel like you lost a family member, and you have to go to the funeral,"" said Add Seymour of Atlanta, Georgia, who registered Friday morning and planned to fly out if picked. ""I got some frequent-flier miles just in case I wanted to do something wild and crazy -- and this is wild and crazy."" Tickets will be handed out Monday outside the Staples Center, said Tim Leiweke, president of AEG Live. Ticketholders will also have wristbands to match their tickets, a precaution against people ""trying to take advantage"" of the system, he said. Although 11,000 seats are available for fans inside the Staples Center, another 6,500 can watch from the Nokia Theater site across the street, according to Leiweke. Police said they will close the area near the Staples Center to all those without a ticket. The family will provide a free live video feed to networks so it can be televised everywhere. ""I want to stress to those people who are coming, or are thinking about coming, to the city for this special event that you might want to consider watching this from the comfort of your home,"" said Councilwoman Jan Perry, the city's acting mayor while Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is out of the country. The city government will provide security for the event, despite a budget crisis, Perry said. Despite the interest surrounding the service, few details have emerged. Ken Ehrlich, known for producing the Grammy Awards, is producing the memorial show, his company said. And Kenny Ortega, who was to have co-directed Jackson's series of concerts in London this summer, will direct it. Singer Jennifer Hudson will be among the performers taking the stage, CNN has confirmed. Drug rumors swirl . Meanwhile, speculation that anesthetic drugs might have played a role in the singer's death June 25 continued to swell Friday after a Los Angeles law enforcement source told The Associated Press that investigators found Diprivan, a powerful sedative, in Jackson's home.  Watch CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta talk with physician who accompanied Jackson on tour » . Earlier in the week, a nutritionist, Cherilyn Lee, said Jackson pleaded for the drug despite being told of its harmful effects. And sources close to Jackson said Thursday that the pop icon traveled with what amounted to a mini-clinic, complete with an IV pole and an anesthesiologist who medicated the insomniac singer, during his HIStory world tour in the mid-90s. Authorities do not know what killed Jackson and await toxicology results, which are due back in two to three weeks. ""We are treating all unnamed sources as rumors. And, as we have stated before, we will not be responding to rumors or innuendo,"" said lawyers for Jackson's cardiologist, Dr. Conrad Murray, on Friday. ""We are awaiting the facts to come out, and we will respond at that time."" Los Angeles police have interviewed Murray, who apparently tried to revive the singer after he was found unconscious at his rented Holmby Hills estate. The department said it is now working with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the state Attorney General's Office as it looks into Jackson's death. ""For anything that has to do with drugs, the DEA are the experts on that,"" said Jim McDonnell, assistant police chief. ""And if you're looking at the prescription issues, where else would you go?"" CNN's Susan Roesgen, Allison Blakely, Jeff King, Denise Quan, Don Lemon, Kay Jones and Drew Griffin in Los Angeles, California, and Danielle Dellorto in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.","NEW: Registration for tickets to singer's memorial service closes .

"(CNN) -- Changing winter conditions are causing Scotland's wild Soay sheep to get smaller, according to a study that suggests climate change can trump natural selection. Can't see me now: Climate change could be shrinking Soay sheep in Scotland. The authors of the study published in ""Science"" believe that it highlights how wide-ranging the effects of global climate change can be, adding further complexity to the changes we might expect to see in animal populations in future. ""It's only in the last few years that we've realized that evolution can influence species' physical traits as quickly as ecological changes can. This study addresses one of the major goals of population biology, namely to untangle the ways in which evolutionary and environmental changes influence a species' traits,"" said Andrew Sugden, deputy and international managing editor at Science. The researchers analyzed body-weight measurements and life-history data for the female members of a population of Soay sheep. The sheep live on the island of Hirta in the St. Kilda archipelago of Scotland and have been studied closely since 1985. They selected body size because it is a heritable trait, and because the sheep have, on average, been decreasing in size for the last 25 years. According to the findings lambs are not growing as quickly as they once did as winters have become shorter so do not need to put on as much as weight in the first months of life to survive. The results suggest that the decrease is primarily an ecological response to environmental variation over the last 25 years. Evolutionary change, the report says, has contributed relatively little. ""Sheep are getting smaller. Well, at least the wild Soay sheep living on a remote Scottish island are. But according to classic evolutionary theory, they should have been getting bigger, because larger sheep tend to be more likely to survive and reproduce than smaller ones, and offspring tend to resemble their parents,"" said study author Tim Coulson of Imperial College London. ""Our findings have solved a paradox that has tormented biologists for years -- why predictions did not match observation. Biologists have realized that ecological and evolutionary processes are intricately intertwined, and they now have a way of dissecting out the contribution of each. Unfortunately it is too early to tell whether a warming world will lead to pocket-sized sheep,"" said Coulson.","Study of wild sheep in Scotland suggests climate change making them smaller .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN)  -- About 13,000 employees at state-run Air India walked off the job for two hours Friday after the airline failed to pay their monthly wage. A man walks past the Air India building in Mumbai. Staff staged a strike to protest against unpaid wages. The strike was the last resort for some employees who say management failed to keep a promise to pay them Friday, said J.B. Kadian, the general secretary of the Air Corporation Employees Union. There have been strained talks between management and three unions -- that includes everyone from the cabin crew to sweepers -- after Air India told the bulk of its employees their pay would be delayed by two weeks. The unions said 13,000 employees participated in the strike but Air India did not provide a number. The walkout comes after management did not follow through on its latest verbal agreement to pay the lowest paid employees by July 3, employees say. Employees normally get paid on the last day of the month. The lowest paid unionized employees make less than $100 a week. Employees said they were angered that their pay was delayed at a time when the airline has continued to buy new planes. Air India's spokesperson J. Bhargava told CNN: ""We will not tolerate any strike. Striking employees will be subject to loss of wages and productive incentives."" Air India is in deep financial trouble. It lost about a billion dollars last year alone. It says it is in a fight for survival due to lower volumes of passengers, the high cost of employing about 31,000 employees as well as the current world financial downturn. Analyst Kapil Kaul from the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation said Air India's problems may stem from bad business decisions rather than the global financial downturn. ""We have seen Air India continue to get planes when they have no money to pay salaries,"" Kaul said. ""At the present time the airline does not have a well structure and realistic business case."" Air India has asked the government to bail it out. It also said it has avoided layoffs unlike other struggling airlines around the world.","Air India employees stage flash strike after monthly paychecks weren't paid .

"(CNN) -- Police in Texas used a Taser on a 42-year-old pastor and pepper spray to disperse members of his church after police said the pastor interfered with a traffic stop. Jose Moran was arrested early Wednesday morning after interfering with the duties of a public servant in the parking lot of a Webster, Texas, building that is being remodeled for the Iglesias Profetica Peniel Church, Webster police said in a written statement. Moran's son, Omar, said his father had been trying to help. He added that his father has heart problems. Moran approached an officer who was handling a traffic stop in the church's parking lot on Wednesday morning, police said. Moran identified himself as the church's pastor and began yelling at the officer, police said. The officer told Moran to leave several times, but Moran did not, police said. The officer then tried to arrest him. But Moran pushed the officer and ran into the church building, police said. Moran's son said after his father asked the officer if he could help, the officer began yelling. The son said his father went back inside the church. The officer followed him and kicked in the church door, he said. The pastor came outside, and a second officer used his Taser twice on the pastor, the younger Moran said. The son's account differs from the police version of events. Police said Moran emerged from the church building with dozens of other people who subsequently surrounded the officer. The officer used pepper spray to disperse the crowd, the statement said. Police said Moran pushed a second officer, who had arrived for backup, when the officer was trying to arrest him. The officer used a Taser to subdue him, police said. Omar Moran said his father remains hospitalized, although police said he had been treated and released. Webster Police Chief Ray Smiley said the Taser was only used once on Moran, but that the tool causes two marks. The driver who had been pulled over was issued two citations and released, police said.","Police, pastor's son give differing accounts of Taser incident .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Thirty people joined National Park Service rangers Saturday in climbing to the crown of the Statue of Liberty, the first tourists to go into the landmark's crown since the 9/11 attacks. Chris Bartnick, 46, and daughter Aleyna, 8, of Merrick, New York, look out from the statue's crown on Saturday. The New York Harbor monument was closed after the terrorist assaults on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon for safety and security reasons, the Interior Department said. ""Once again, Americans can climb to Lady Liberty's crown and gaze out over New York Harbor, where so many of our ancestors first saw the New World and first breathed the fresh air of freedom,"" Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said as he welcomed visitors back on the Fourth of July holiday. ""This is a celebration of America and the joy of being an American."" Visitors on Saturday were grateful they could go inside the landmark. ""It's just basically safety for our country and at least they opened it,"" visitor Ira Semapadilla told CNN affiliate NY1 before the visit.

Only 10 visitors are permitted to ascend the steps at any one time, meaning about 240 people can make the climb during the park's 8:30 a.m. to 6:15 p.m. hours of operation. The opportunity to climb Lady Liberty will end again in two years, when work will begin on further safety and security upgrades.","Monument in New York Harbor closed since 9/11 attacks .

"(CNN) -- Investigators have heard a signal from the flight data recorders of the Yemenia Airways plane that crashed last week, they announced Sunday. Search parties continue their operation to locate the Yemenia Airbus A310 off the Comoros Islands Saturday. ""A signal was picked up from two acoustic transmitters from the plane's flight data recorders during a sea search to locate the data recorders this morning,"" the French air accident investigation agency, known as the BEA, said in a statement. Commonly known as ""black boxes,"" the data recorders should contain information to help determine what caused the crash. The Yemenia Airways Airbus 310 crashed into the Indian Ocean early Tuesday, carrying 142 passengers and 11 crew members. It originated in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, and went down just miles from Moroni, the capital of the Comoros Islands. One person, a 13-year-old French girl, survived. Bahia Basari, who lives in Marseille, escaped with cuts to her face and a fractured collarbone.  Watch teen survivor from crash » . The teen's father, Kassim Bakari, told a French radio network that his wife and daughter were flying to Comoros to visit relatives. ""When I had her on the phone, I asked her what happened and she said, 'Daddy, I don't know what happened, but the plane fell into the water and I found myself in the water... surrounded by darkness. I could not see anyone,'"" Bakari told France Info. The head of the rescue team in the Comoros told French radio RTL that the teenager beat astonishing odds to survive. ""It is truly, truly, miraculous,"" Ibrahim Abdoulazeb said. ""The young girl can barely swim."" Another rescuer told France's Europe 1 radio that the girl was spotted in the rough sea, among bodies and plane debris in darkness, about two hours after the crash. The Airbus 310 plane tried to land at the airport in Moroni, then made a U-turn before it crashed, Comoros Vice President Idi Nadhoim said soon after the accident. A French official said the nation had banned the plane after it failed an aviation inspection in 2007. ""Since this check-up, we have not seen the plane reappearing in France,"" said Dominique Bussereau, the transport minister. But Yemenia Airlines was not on the European Union's list of banned airlines, he added. Passengers on the flight included 66 French citizens, 54 Comorians, one Palestinian and one Canadian, according to Yemeni and French officials. The crew was made up of six Yemenis, two Moroccans, one Ethiopian, one Filipino and one Indonesian.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Dean Still had been researching and developing cleaner, more environmentally-friendly wood-burning stoves for almost two decades when, while working for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, he spotted a coal stove for sale on a street corner near Tibet, China. Workers at Shengzhou Stove Manufacturers prepare wood-burning stoves for firing. He had been looking for an established manufacturer who could mass-produce the more efficient, lower-emission stoves he had been developing with the Aprovecho Research Center (ARC), a non-profit research and education center based in Oregon in the United States. ""It looked perfect. It had all the components,"" Still told CNN. ""I knew we could change it to a wood-burning stove. There was a cell phone number on the side, so I called it."" Shen Huiyang of Shengzhou Stove Manufacturers (SSM), based over a thousand miles away, answered. The two met and a short time later, in August 2007, an agreement was signed between ARC and SSM. Shen's factory began producing the new wood-burning stoves last year. Last week, the two companies were declared ""Global Energy Champions"" by the Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy at a ceremony in London, England. The vast majority of the 60,000 stoves they've sold since entering their partnership have gone to Envirofit International, a U.S.-based non-profit organization which markets the stoves in India, supported by the Shell Foundation. Others are sold in Argentina, Chile, the Marshall Islands, Madagascar, South Africa and Tanzania. Shen said: ""We have produced coal stoves for many years, and it is wonderful to be able to use our experience to make a wood stove that brings benefits to so many people."" The pair won $65,000 to develop the scheme which Still says will be spent on research and development, and to employ more sales people. ""What I'm doing now is talking to the U.N., to relief agencies, just anybody in the world who might have an interest in burning wood more cleanly, and using less of it,"" he said. The principle behind the stove is simple. With a better insulated combustion chamber, the fire requires less wood and burns hot enough for the smoke to combust as well, which means far fewer emissions. According to the World Health Organization, about half the world still cooks with biomass or coal, using open fires or traditional stoves. The resulting emissions cause indoor air pollution, leading to pneumonia, chronic respiratory disease and lung cancer. This indoor air pollution causes 1.6 million deaths a year, primarily among children and women. The emissions also contribute to climate change, and the collection of firewood contributes to deforestation and erosion. ARC say tests performed on the stoves indicate major breakthroughs for both the environment and health in the developing world. The stoves reduce the use of wood for fuel by up to 50 percent, and cut carbon monoxide emissions by up to 70 percent compared to a traditional fire.","U.S. research center, Chinese stove manufacter win joint environment award .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Friday's two-train collision killed 25 people and injured more than 130 others near Los Angeles after an engineer failed to heed a traffic signal, a spokeswoman for Metrolink commuter trains said. A commuter rail car lies on its side after a collision Friday near Los Angeles, California. The engineer was guiding the Metrolink train that slammed head-on into a freight train and is not believed to have survived, Metrolink spokeswoman Denise Tyrrell said on Saturday. ""It was human error,"" Tyrrell said, adding this was Metrolink's belief ""barring any new information"" from an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. NTSB spokeswoman Kitty Higgins said the agency would ""look at everything before we rule anything in or out."" Tyrrell said the engineer, whom she didn't identify, was a subcontractor employed by another company. She said she did not have details of his record. The crash occurred about 4:30 p.m. PT Friday in Chatsworth, a northwest Los Angeles suburb. The Metrolink train had about 220 passengers and two crew members on board at the time, according to Tyrrell.  Watch rescuers search for victims » . Forty-five of the injured were in critical condition, with 40 flown to hospitals, Tyrrell said. Another 50 had minor injuries, and 40 others were treated at the crash site but transported to hospitals for evaluation. ""It was like running into a brick wall at 60 miles an hour,"" an injured passenger told CNN affiliate KABC. In the minutes after the crash, passers-by joined emergency personnel in an effort to free passengers from the wreckage. On Saturday afternoon, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said the search of the wreckage had finished. Earlier in the day, authorities were picking through the wreckage and freeing trapped bodies. Ed Winter, assistant chief of the Los Angeles County coroner's office, told reporters two bodies -- both of females -- had yet to be identified. If the females had carried identification, it probably was lost in the crash, he said. As of 9 a.m. PT Saturday, authorities had been able to notify relatives of eight victims, he said. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger visited the crash site on Saturday, telling reporters it was ""one of the worst train accidents in modern history in California."" The NTSB will make a final determination of the crash's cause. Higgins, the agency's spokeswoman, said data recorders have been recovered from both trains, along with a video recorder from the freight train. Higgins said that out of the trains' five crew members, four survived. Authorities will interview the surviving crew members, Higgins said. Tyrrell said a review of ""a number of programs,"" including the signal system, showed the commuter train's engineer failed to heed a stop signal, Tyrrell said. ""We don't know how the error happened, but this is what we believe happened,"" Tyrrell said. The wreck occurred on a curved part of the track where the speed limit is 40 mph, Tyrrell said. She said that just like road vehicles, trains are subject to signal systems. At the wreck site is a siding where one train can wait while another passes, she said. ""They receive a signal to stop and they must hold their location until other traffic has passed,"" she said. Villaraigosa praised police officers and firefighters for working under emotionally draining conditions and treating the victims with respect. ""This has been a grueling night for them,"" he said. The crash sparked a fire that impeded firefighters's efforts to reach the front commuter car, where most of the injuries occurred, Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. The fire eventually was brought under control. ""We've already found survivors trapped under fatalities,"" Whitmore said late Friday. Among those killed was Spree Desha, 35, a Los Angeles police officer on her way home from work, officials said Saturday. ""It's not unusual for us to respond to disasters,"" said Jerry Szymanski, an assistant commander for the LAPD. ""When we got here, we found it was one that hit close to home."" Desha had ""mentored and trained a lot of the young officers in the North Hollywood area,"" Szymanski said. Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca said Friday night a sheriff's deputy was in a hospital's intensive care unit after collapsing while conducting rescue work.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The court battle may finally be over, but there is still a great mystery hanging over the next America's Cup event: What will the holders use to defend the trophy? America's Cup team Oracle has trialed a trimaran which it revealed in September 2008 . Established in 1851, the America's Cup is the oldest active trophy of any sport and by far the most prestigious match race sailing event in the world. Scheduled for February 2010, the 33rd edition of the America's Cup will be contested by the holders -- Swiss syndicate Alinghi, and U.S. challenger Oracle, owned by Larry Ellison. The date follows protracted court battles which saw both teams fighting over the terms of the next event. Last month's New York Supreme Court ruling which finally decided the terms and date of the regatta also announced that the contest is to be decided in a one-off series in multihull boats. While Oracle revealed a 90 ft trimaran last year, defenders Alinghi are still building their boat for the event -- and they are refusing to give away any secrets about it. CNN's MainSail show visited the Alinghi base in Switzerland to try to catch a glimpse of the mystery vessel -- but they came no closer to seeing the boat under construction. MainSail presenter Shirley Robertson only got as far as the compound gates in her quest to see the vessel. Watch video of CNN visiting the Alinghi team base »  The team's design co-coordinator, Grant Simms, told CNN that the design would not be revealed until the latest possible point. ""It's quite unusual and we are trying to keep it a secret as long as we can. ""We are hoping to stop our opponents from seeing it and reacting to it,"" he said. The design of the boat is generally a crucial part of any America's Cup regatta -- and none more so than this one, where a different type of boat is being introduced. Also, the size and shape of the boat could indicate where the regatta may be held -- something that doesn't need to be announced by defenders Alinghi until six months before it is set to begin. The cup holders can set the terms of the next defense, in conjunction with the ""challenger of record"" -- whichever team signs up as the first challenger. This is important as different locations can have a wide variety of wind strengths and sea swells, which can suit varying sizes of boat and types of sail. You can watch this month's MainSail show in full on CNN International or on the MainSail Web site from Thursday 18th June.","Next America's Cup to be decided between Alinghi and Oracle in February .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Janelle Monae is a girl from another planet, and she's invading your world. Janelle Monae creates ""cool, futuristic soul with a real '80s quality,"" says a DJ. Sightings of the singer-songwriter will include this week's ""American Idol"" finale, the Hollywood Bowl and concert stages across America this summer and TV's Sci Fi Channel this fall. Monae insists that her real identity is Cindi Mayweather, an android traveling through space and time to escape destruction ordered because she fell in love with a human, a fatal infraction of robots' rules. Along the way, she's making music that moves into the future while drawing from decades past. ""It is cool, futuristic soul with a real '80s quality,"" said Garth Trinidad, a disc jockey at Los Angeles, California, radio station KCRW. Trinidad spotted Monae three years ago, and he's been watching her like an astronomer tracking the approach of a distant comet destined to light Earth's sky. ""I believe she's going to be a household name in the next year or two,"" said Trinidad, a self-described ""champion of the underdog"" who is credited with giving Jill Scott and Gnarls Barkley early radio airplay. Monae -- the human -- is a striking combination of voice, style, imagination and fearlessness that defies conventional description, making it easier to buy into the fantasy of Mayweather the android. When her song ""Many Moons"" was nominated for a Grammy in December, it was in the urban/alternative category. If Monae is an android from the future, her musical programming included the past. Trinidad compared her ""very fluid, very pleasing"" voice to Donna Summer, circa 1976. At a Los Angeles show this month, she mixed 20th-century classics with her own futuristic songs. Monae delivered a sweet version of Nat King Cole's ""Smile"" while standing atop a barstool. Senior citizens danced the ""Twist"" when her band broke out into the Beatles' 1964 hit ""I Saw Her Standing There."" She loves timeless music, Monae said after her show. ""We look to a lot of people whose bodies are dead and gone, but their spirit is still with us,"" Monae said. Her choreography borrows from James Brown, Michael Jackson and Devo, with dance moves from the future. Monae -- or Mayweather -- thinks she can fly. She jumped head-first into the audience, ""crowd surfing"" the unlikely mosh pit in UCLA's Royce Hall. Search Monae's name on YouTube and you'll see her jumping into swimming pools to end her shows. She climbed a tree in New York -- after her swim. Unlike some performers, her talent matches Monae's onstage antics, Trinidad said. ""It's one thing for her to perform a certain way, but she backs with it up with talent,"" he said. Monae's android-on-the-run theme, reminiscent of the 1982 movie ""Blade Runner,"" reminds Trinidad ""of all the great albums from the past that had a story and concept attached."" ""She was just kind of like bored with everything else going on, and she wanted to transcend it and tell a story,"" he said. Monae said she is not following a formula, that she is ""being led by my maker."" ""I'm very similar to a terminal,"" she said. Monae will inevitably capture the world's attention because she is ""outshining a lot of what's happening in the mainstream,"" Trinidad said. That time may be near. Sean ""Diddy"" Combs signed her to his Bad Boy Records, giving her music distribution. Coca-Cola hired Monae to sing on its ""Open Happiness"" ad campaign. It airs on this week's ""American Idol"" finale. Her tour stops next month include at least six shows in the northeastern United States, opening for Gwen Stefani's reunited rock group No Doubt. Monae then plays the Hollywood Bowl with the legendary jazz singer Etta James. She plays herself in two episodes of the Sci Fi Channel's ""Stargate Universe"" this fall.","Janelle Monae popping up on commercial, on tour, on TV .

"(CNN) -- A Singapore man undergoing treatment for cancer was detained for four hours by U.S. immigration officials after the drug he was taking caused his fingerprints to disappear. Foreign visitors undergo mandatory fingerprint screening when they enter the United States. Now, the unidentified man's oncologist is asking patients taking the commonly used drug, capecitabine, to carry a doctor's note when they travel to the United States. The oncologist, Eng-Huat Tan of the National Cancer Center in Singapore, described the encounter in a letter published in the current issue of the cancer journal Annals of Oncology. The 62-year-old cancer patient, identified as Mr. S, eventually was allowed to enter the United States and visit relatives after officials determined he did not pose a security threat. According to the oncologist, the patient had neck and head cancer that had spread. He responded well to chemotherapy. To prevent a recurrence, doctors placed him on capecitabine, marketed in the United States as Xeloda. One of the side effects of the drug is hand-foot syndrome. It causes the skin on the hands and feet to peel. With time, the drug can erase fingerprints. ""It is uncertain when the onset of fingerprint loss will take place in susceptible patients who are taking capecitabine,"" the doctor wrote. His patient started on the drug in July 2005. ""However, it is possible that there may be a growing number of such patients as Mr. S. ... These patients should prepare adequately before traveling to avert the inconvenience that Mr. S was put through.""

Michael Hayden, who served as former President Bush's last CIA director from 2006 to 2009, said releasing the memos outlining terror interrogation methods emboldened terrorist groups such as al Qaeda. ""What we have described for our enemies in the midst of a war are the outer limits that any American would ever go to in terms of interrogating an al Qaeda terrorist. That's very valuable information,"" Hayden said during an appearance on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""By taking [certain] techniques off the table, we have made it more difficult -- in a whole host of circumstances I can imagine -- for CIA officers to defend the nation,"" he said. But Sens. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said certain techniques should not have been allowed in the first place. McCaskill called them ""a great recruitment tool for those who want to do harm to our country."" White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel dismissed Hayden's assertion that releasing the memos had undermined U.S. intelligence efforts by giving al Qaeda critical new information. ""One of the reasons the president was willing to let this information out was that already the information was out,"" he said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""Go get the New York Review of Books. It's there."" Hayden said he called several senior White House officials to express his opposition before the president released the documents. Hayden also noted that four previous CIA directors, as well as current agency director Leon Panetta, opposed the release. The memos said, among other things, that interrogation tactics such as waterboarding, sleep deprivation and slapping did not violate laws against torture absent the intent to cause severe pain. Obama prohibited the use of so-called ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" such as waterboarding shortly after taking office in January. Such techniques ""undermine our moral authority and do not make us safer,"" he said Thursday, when the White House released the memos. The Obama administration has said it won't pursue charges against CIA officers who used those tactics against prisoners in their custody. And Emanuel told ABC that the people who crafted the policy ""should not be prosecuted either."" But in a sharply worded editorial Sunday, The New York Times called for the impeachment of Jay Bybee, a federal appeals court judge who was a Justice Department official when he wrote one of the memos that authorized those techniques. ""These memos make it clear that Mr. Bybee is unfit for a job that requires legal judgment and a respect for the Constitution,"" the newspaper editorialized. The memos ""were written to provide legal immunity for acts that are clearly illegal, immoral and a violation of this country's most basic values,"" it stated. Asked about that call on ""Fox News Sunday,"" McCaskill said: ""I think we have to look at it."" McCaskill, a member of the Senate's standing investigative subcommittee, said the Obama administration made the right decision by agreeing not to prosecute intelligence officers. But she added: ""A lawyer that's responsible for this kind of advice that clearly went too far in terms of stretching what our law is -- it worries me that he's sitting on the federal bench right now."" Graham, however, said seeking to punish lawyers who advised the Bush administration ""is a very bad precedent."" ""I think it would be disaster to go back and try to prosecute a lawyer for giving legal advice that you disagreed with to a former president,"" said Graham, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a lawyer in the Air Force reserve. Hayden said the administration's decision to release the Bush administration memos will make CIA officials less willing to engage in interrogation tactics now sanctioned by the federal government. ""The basic foundation of the legitimacy of the agency's action has shifted from some durability of law to a product of the American political process. That puts agency officers in a horrible position,"" he said. ""The really dangerous effect of this [decision] is that you'll have agency officers stepping back from the kinds of things that the nation expects them to do. ... You're going to have this agency -- on the front line of defending you in this current war -- playing back from the line,"" he said. Hayden also said that, contrary to the assertions of many critics, the interrogation techniques in question had forced suspected terrorists to reveal valuable information and made the country safer. He predicted that the release of the memos would be ""just the beginning."" ""There will be more revelations, more commissions, there will be more investigations,"" Hayden said. McCaskill told ""Fox News Sunday"" that the United States will be better off in the long run by clearly prohibiting interrogation techniques such as waterboarding. And Graham said that while he was concerned that the release of the memos was a ""huge tactical and strategic mistake done for political reasons,"" the decision to allow certain enhanced interrogation techniques was a mistake as well. Graham added that he always thought waterboarding ""was a procedure that would come back to haunt the country, and quite frankly it has.""","Michael Hayden: Releasing Bush-era interrogation memos harmful .

"GAFFNEY, South Carolina (CNN) -- Investigators believe the serial killer blamed for five deaths in South Carolina died in a shootout with police in neighboring North Carolina on Monday, a South Carolina state police official said. Patrick Tracy Burris, 41, was believed to be the suspect in five slayings in South Carolina, authorities say. Tests on the gun found on 41-year-old Patrick Tracy Burris match the weapon used in the killings that have haunted Gaffney, South Carolina, since June 27, said Reggie Lloyd, director of South Carolina's State Law Enforcement Division. The dead suspect and his vehicle appear to match descriptions circulated by investigators in Gaffney, he said. ""We believe a killer is off the streets,"" Lloyd said. Burris was killed early Monday morning in Dallas, North Carolina, after police received a call about a possible burglary in progress, officers there said. At a news conference Monday evening, investigators described him as a ""habitual felon"" with a record in several states who was on probation at the time he was killed. When police arrived at the home, they found inside two people who lived there and a third who was an acquaintance, said Bill Blanton, the sheriff of Cherokee County, South Carolina. Police checked Burris' background and found there was an outstanding warrant on him from a probation violation from Lincoln County, North Carolina.  Watch Lloyd say why police think they've got their man » . When police attempted to serve the warrant, Burris shot at the officers, who returned fired, Blanton said. One officer was shot in the leg and was treated and released from a hospital, police said. At a news conference Monday night, Lloyd held up what he said was Burris' 25-page rap sheet, including a lengthy history of armed robberies, forgeries, break-ins and several other charges from several states. ""At some point the criminal justice system is going to have to explain why this individual was out on the streets -- we owe that to the victims,"" he said. About 100 investigators from North and South Carolina were working the case, Blanton said. Leaves for all members of the Gaffney Police Department and the Sheriff's Department were canceled, their respective chiefs have said. The first shooting occurred June 27, when peach farmer Kline W. Cash, 63, was killed. His wife found him dead in their home, the sheriff's office said, and Blanton said the home may have been robbed. Four days later, the bound and shot bodies of Hazel Linder, 83, and her 50-year-old daughter, Gena Linder Parker, were found in Linder's home, where she lived alone. Blanton said authorities are still trying to determine if anything was taken from that home. The killer's last victim was 15-year-old Abby Tyler, who was shot last week and died Saturday. Her father Stephen Tyler, 48, had been pronounced dead at the scene of the shooting, in their family-run furniture and appliance store.  See a map of where the bodies were found » . Lloyd said investigators had evidence that put Burris at the scene of the killings, but did not know a motive. ""There's no hard evidence as to what connections he had with this community or why he targeted these victims,"" Lloyd said. He added that the investigation is ongoing, and that officials are trying to determine what the suspect was up to between the killings and after the last the shooting. ""We don't believe at this point anyone else was involved in the murders, but anything could turn up,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The World Bank cut China's economic growth forecast in 2009 to 6.5 percent Wednesday, down a full percentage point from November's projection. Workers assemble toys on a production line at a factory in Shantou, in China's Guangdong province. Despite the downgrade, ""China is a relative bright spot in an otherwise gloomy global economy,"" said the World Bank's David Dollar. Last week, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao reiterated projections that the nation's economy will grow by 8 percent in 2009, despite doubts expressed by domestic and international economic analysts. Some have forecast growth as low as 5 percent. ""I will admit it will be a difficult job [to reach 8 percent]. This being said, I also believe with considerable efforts it's possible for us to obtain this goal,"" Wen said at a news conference following the annual session of the country's rubber-stamp legislature. China has seen a sharp decline in demand for its exports since November as other major economies have struggled. In February, Chinese exports plunged 25.7 percent compared with the previous year's, Beijing reported last week. Even with the slowdown, China's economy -- the third largest in the world -- has gone from white-hot to merely robust. In 2007, China's gross domestic product grew at 13 percent. The two largest economies -- the United States and Japan -- are in recession. ""So a lot of things will go down in 2009 globally,"" Dollar said. ""But we see China's contribution as being very positive in keeping many markets from going down as far as they would otherwise."" The World Bank expects China's economy to outgrow most others in 2009. In November, China announced plans to inject $586 billion (4 trillion yuan) into its economy to offset declines in industrial and export growth. That economic stimulus plan included the loosening of credit restrictions, tax cuts and massive infrastructure spending.","World Bank cuts China's economic growth forecast in 2009 to 6.5 percent .

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN)  -- Coca cultivation and cocaine production have decreased in Colombia but increased in Bolivia and Peru, the United Nations reported. Workers help eradicate coca plantations in northwest Colombia in May. Colombian cultivation was down 18 percent, and production decreased 28 percent in 2008, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime said in a report issued Friday. But cultivation increased 6 percent in Bolivia and 4.5 percent in Peru, the report said. Likewise, production went up 9 percent in Bolivia and 4.1 percent in Peru. ""The increases for Bolivia and Peru show a trend in the wrong direction,"" said Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the U.N. drug office. Much of the decline in Colombia resulted from the manual eradication of 237 acres of coca, an increase of 44 percent over 2007, and the spraying of another 328 acres with herbicide, the U.N. said. The production level is at a 10-year-low, the report said, and the cultivation amount is down to 2004 to 2006 levels. ""This is a remarkable achievement,"" Costa said in a release. ""It means that more coca bush was eradicated in Colombia than was grown in all of Bolivia and Peru."" The value of coca leaf in Colombia is decreasing, making it less attractive for farmers -- 20,000 fewer households grew coca in 2008 than in 2007, a decrease of 26 percent. The drug trade also is being disrupted, the report said. In Colombia, the U.N. said, authorities seized 200 tons of cocaine in 2008, a 57 percent increase in seizures over 2007, the report said. Peru reported an 86 percent increase in seizures of coca base and a 100 percent increase in the seizure of cocaine. Bolivia, likewise, reported a 45 percent uptick in seizures of coca base and a 145 percent increase in the seizure of cocaine. ""Cocaine supply is shrinking, as is demand in major markets of North America while cocaine use in Western Europe has stopped growing,"" Costa said. ""This may explain why prices are up, and purity is down. This may also explain why cartels are becoming so violent.""","Coca cultivation, cocaine production decrease in Colombia, U.N. report says .

"OXON HILL, Maryland (CNN) -- Crew members of the Maersk Alabama, safely back in the United States after being attacked by pirates last week off Somalia, recounted their ordeal Thursday. Navy personnel recover the lifeboat from which Maersk Alabama Capt. Richard Phillips was rescued Sunday. ""They start firing before they climb, with AK-47,"" crew member Zahid Reza said. ""I was scared for my life. I was almost close to that. And they tried to shoot me many times,"" he said, pointing to his head. ""Pointing gun all over. Here, there, in the back."" Pirates tried three times to board the U.S.-flagged cargo ship before their fourth attempt was successful, fellow crew member William Rios said, adding that the groups of pirates were different but that he thinks they were working together. Rios said he was working on deck when he was called back to lock down the ship. Then, he said, there were gunshots, and an alarm went off to alert all crew members to wake up and get on deck. ""We went to our training,"" he said, declining to provide details: ""If I tell you all what we did, pirates, they would know.""  Watch the crew praise their captain » . The pirates intended to ask for a $3 million ransom, Reza said. He said he and the ship's chief engineer took one of the pirates hostage. Reza said he persuaded the pirate -- whom he described as a young man, maybe 18 or 19 -- to trust him, pointing out that he is Bangladeshi and the pirate was Somali. ""His name is Abdul,"" Reza said. ""I told him, 'Trust me. I am Muslim; you are Muslim.' "" He told Abdul he would take him to the engine room to find more crew members. When they got there, the room was dark, he said, and he didn't know the ship's chief engineer was in there. He said the chief engineer jumped the pirate first, then Reza stabbed him with his knife, and the two men tied the pirate's hands and feet. Reza said he intended to kill the youth, but the chief engineer told him, ""No, we need him alive.""  Watch Reza talk about wanting to kill the pirate » . ""He was fighting me and chief engineer, to get away from us. A lot of yelling, shouting and screaming."" Rios said he went to the lifeboat, where Capt. Richard Phillips was being held, to exchange Abdul for Phillips but was unsuccessful. The captain -- who offered himself as a hostage in exchange for the freedom of his crew -- was rescued by U.S. Navy SEALs on Sunday. The SEALs, on the nearby guided-missile destroyer USS Bainbridge, fatally shot three pirates and rescued Phillips. A fourth pirate was arrested. ""I feel great they got killed,"" Reza said. ""I am happy."" He said he was proud of the Navy. Phillips arrived in Mombasa, Kenya, aboard the Bainbridge on Thursday. The crew arrived at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland overnight.

"(CNN) -- Former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, a key architect of the U.S. war in Vietnam under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, has died at age 93, according to his family. Robert McNamara took a lead role in managing the U.S. military commitment in Vietnam. McNamara was a member of Kennedy's inner circle during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, when the United States and the Soviet Union stood on the brink of nuclear war. But he became a public lightning rod for his management of the war in Vietnam, overseeing the U.S. military commitment there as it grew from fewer than 1,000 advisers to more than half a million troops. Though the increasingly unpopular conflict was sometimes dubbed ""McNamara's War,"" he later said both administrations were ""terribly wrong"" to have pursued military action beyond 1963. ""External military force cannot reconstruct a failed state, and Vietnam, during much of that period, was a failed state politically,"" he told CNN in a 1996 interview for the ""Cold War"" documentary series. ""We didn't recognize it as such."" A native of San Francisco, McNamara studied economics at the University of California and earned a master's degree in business from Harvard. He was a staff officer in the Army Air Corps during World War II, when he studied the results of American bombing raids on Germany and Japan in search of ways to improve their accuracy and efficiency. After the war, he joined the Ford Motor Company and became its president in November 1960 -- the first person to lead the company from outside its founding family. A month later, the newly elected Kennedy asked him to become secretary of defense, making him one of the ""whiz kids"" who joined the young president's administration. In October 1962, after the discovery of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba, McNamara was one of Kennedy's top advisers in the standoff that followed. The United States imposed a naval ""quarantine"" on Cuba, a Soviet ally, and prepared for possible airstrikes or an invasion. The Soviets withdrew the missiles in exchange for a U.S. guarantee not to invade Cuba, a step that allowed Soviet premier Nikita Kruschev to present the pullback as a success to his own people. In the 2003 documentary ""The Fog of War,"" McNamara told filmmaker Errol Morris that the experience taught American policymakers to ""put ourselves inside their skin and look at us through their eyes."" But he added, ""In the end, we lucked out. It was luck that prevented nuclear war."" McNamara is credited with using the management techniques he mastered as a corporate executive to streamline the Pentagon, computerizing and smoothing out much of the U.S. military's vast purchasing and personnel system. And in Vietnam, he attempted to use those techniques to measure the progress of the war. Metrics such as use of ""body counts"" and scientific solutions such as using the herbicide Agent Orange to defoliate jungles in which communist guerrillas hid became trademarks of the conflict. McNamara made several trips to South Vietnam to study the situation firsthand. He, Johnson and other U.S. officials portrayed the war as a necessary battle in the Cold War, a proxy struggle to prevent communism from taking control of all of Southeast Asia. But while they saw the conflict as another front in the standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union, which backed communist North Vietnam, McNamara acknowledged later that they underestimated Vietnamese nationalism and opposition to the U.S.-backed government in Saigon. ""The conflict within South Vietnam itself had all of the characteristics of a civil war, and we didn't look upon it as largely a civil war, and we weren't measuring our progress as one would have in what was largely a civil war,"" he told CNN. Casualties mounted, as did domestic opposition to the war. In 1965, a Quaker anti-war protester, Norman Morrison, set himself on fire outside McNamara's office window. In 1967, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched on the Pentagon, which was ringed with troops. By November 1967, McNamara told Johnson that there was ""no reasonable way"" to end the war quickly, and that the United States needed to reduce its forces in Vietnam and turn the fighting over to the American-backed government in Saigon. By the end of that month, Johnson announced he was replacing McNamara at the Pentagon and moving him to the World Bank. But by March 1968, Johnson had reached virtually the same conclusion as McNamara. He issued a call for peace talks and announced he would not seek re-election. After leaving the Pentagon in early 1968, McNamara spent 12 years leading the World Bank. He said little publicly about Vietnam until the publication of a 1995 memoir, ""In Retrospect."" ""You don't know what I know about how inflammatory my words can appear,"" he told Morris. ""A lot of people misunderstand the war, misunderstand me. A lot of people think I'm a son of a bitch.""","Robert McNamara was key architect of war in Vietnam under two presidents .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Accidents happen, said the Supreme Court, but the criminal penalties can still be tough, at least for one ""bungling bank robber."" The case involved Christopher Michael Dean, arrested after he and a partner robbed a bank five years ago. By a 7-2 vote, the justices ruled Wednesday that the sentencing for a felon who accidentally fired a gun during a crime should be the same as if he had fired intentionally. The case involved Christopher Michael Dean, arrested after he and a partner robbed a Rome, Georgia, bank five years ago. The masked Dean had waved a gun and ordered patrons and staff to get down. While grabbing bills in one hand, the gun he was carrying in his other hand went off. The bullet hit a partition, and no one was injured. After the shot, Dean cursed and immediately ran out of the bank. Witnesses later testified he seemed surprised the weapon had gone off. Dean was charged in federal court and admitted committing the robbery. His sentence included a mandatory 10-year prison term for ""discharging"" a weapon during a crime. He appealed, saying the sentencing enhancement required proof that he intended to discharge the firearm, and his actions were accidental. But in his majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts said federal law ""does not require that the discharge be done knowingly or intentionally."" In what has become a regular feature of his writing, the 54-year-old chief justice displayed a sense of creativity and sly humor in his conclusions. He openly called Dean the ""bungling bank robber"" and quoted one patron's reaction to the bank gunshot: ""Melissa in the lobby popped up and said, 'Oh, my God, has he shot Nora?' "" Nora turned out to be all right. Justice John Paul Stevens dissented in the case, noting, ""Accidents happen, but they seldom give rise to criminal liability. Indeed, if they cause no harm they seldom give rise to any liability. The court nevertheless holds that petitioner is subject to a mandatory additional sentence -- a species of criminal liability -- for an accident that caused no harm."" He was supported by Justice Stephen Breyer. Roberts, however, saved the best for last in his bench remarks, when summarizing the ruling. ""An individual who brings a loaded weapon to commit a crime runs the risk that the gun will discharge accidentally,"" he said. ""Those criminals wishing to avoid the penalty for an inadvertent discharge can lock or unload the firearm, handle it with care during the underlying violent or drug trafficking crime, leave the gun at home, or -- best yet -- avoid committing the felony in the first place,"" Roberts wrote . That brought barely contained laughter in the audience of several hundred gathered in the courtroom.","Robber appealed 10-year sentence for discharging a gun in a bank .

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Venus Williams ensured the Wimbledon final would be another family affair with a devastating performance against Russia's Dinara Safina in Thursday's second semifinal. Venus dropped only one game as she crushed top seed Dinara Safina to reach her eighth Wimbledon final. Third seed Venus produced an awesome display on Centre Court, crushing world No.1 Safina 6-1 6-0 in just 51 minutes, after sister Serena had earlier won an epic three-set semifinal against Elena Dementieva. There was no way five-times champion Venus, was being sucked into such a dogfight. Her match was a much more subdued affair as she outclassed the top seed from the moment she settled into the match, winning the first nine points and breaking the Safina serve. Safina simply could not cope with the Williams serve, with one ace in the third game clocking in at 124mph, the fastest in the women's tournament. Safina managed to get her side of the scoreboard ticking in the sixth game but it was no consolation as Venus stepped up the power on her groundstrokes. When Venus broke the Safina serve again at the start of the second set the match was essentially over. Unforced errors sprayed from Safina's racket throughout the second set and a double fault in the fifth game handed Williams another break of serve. The end eventually came when Safina dumped another forehand into the net to allow Venus to take the match, after which she expressed her delight at another all-Williams, all-American final on July 4. Venus told the BBC: ""This is my eighth final and it is a dream come true to have another opportunity to hold the plate up. ""I was able to stay focused and I have so much experience on this court.

"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania (CNN)  -- Wendell Potter says he is finished defending the insurance industry, which he says is ""beholden to Wall Street."" Wendell Potter once was a vice president in the public relations department for insurance giant Cigna. At a hearing last week before the Senate Commerce Committee, the former vice president of corporate communications at the insurance giant Cigna testified, ""I know from personal experience that members of Congress and the public have good reason to question the honesty and trustworthiness of the insurance industry."" The committee's chairman, Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia, told Potter, ""You are better than Russell Crowe on 'The Insider,' "" referring to the award-winning 1999 film about cigarette company executive Jeffrey Wigand, who blew the whistle on the tobacco industry's practices. In his testimony and during an interview with CNN, Potter described how underwriters at his former company would drive small businesses with expensive insurance claims to dump their Cigna policies. Industry executives refer to the practice as ""purging,"" Potter said. ""When that business comes up for renewal, the underwriters jack the rates up so much, the employer has no choice but to drop insurance,"" Potter said. CNN obtained a transcript of a 2008 Cigna conference call with investors in which company executives use the term ""purge."" But in an e-mail to CNN, Cigna spokesman Chris Curran denied the company engages in purging. ""We do not practice that. We will offer rates that are reflective of the competitive group health insurance market. We always encourage our clients to compare our proposed rates to those available from other carriers,"" Curran wrote. Cigna had revenue of $19.1 billion in 2008, according to the company Web site. P . ""It was almost like an electrical jolt,"" Potter said. At the event, Potter took pictures of doctors offering free health care to the uninsured. ""The volunteer doctors were seeing patients in barns, people in animal stalls,"" Potter said. ""It changed it for me."" He says he finally decided to quit in 2007 after Cigna's controversial handling of an insurance claim made by the family of a California teenager, Nataline Sarkysian. The Sarkysian family made repeated appeals at news conferences for Cigna to approve a liver transplant for the 17-year-old, who had leukemia. Cigna initially declined to cover the operation, then reversed its decision. Sarkysian died hours after the company's reversal. As Cigna's spokesman during the controversy, Potter had no role in the decision to deny coverage. But he was inundated with angry phone calls. ""After she died, my voice mail and my e-mail inbox were just filled with messages from people who were just outraged, "" Potter said. Now a senior fellow on health care for the nonpartisan watchdog group Center for Media and Democracy, Potter writes a blog on health care reform. In particular, he is keeping an eye on efforts to defeat legislation that would give Americans the option of joining a government health care plan, something he now supports. He says he witnessed how the insurance industry torpedoed health care reform efforts during the Clinton administration. ""They conduct what I call duplicitous PR campaigns. They'll say what people want to hear,"" Potter says. ""It's how they operate. You cannot trust these guys."" Potter is also taking aim at some of the TV commercials aired by groups opposed to changes. One such ad caught Potter's eye. Run by the conservative organization Patients United Now, the ad says that ""now, Washington wants to bring Canadian-style health care to the U.S."" ""Sometimes you'll see misleading information. And sometimes you'll see outright lies, like that [ad] is,"" Potter said, referring to the spot. Patients United Now spokeswoman Amy Menefee disagreed. ""We're not saying there's a Canada health care act of 2009,"" Menefee said. ""It is a trend. It's trending in that direction."" Potter notes that the leading proposals for health care in Congress do not seek to set up Canadian-style health care in the United States. He says claims that overhauling the system would lead to ""rationing"" of care are missing his point. ""What we have is rationing by corporate executives who are beholden to Wall Street. And it happens all the time,"" Potter said.","Wendell Potter says insurance companies only out to please Wall Street investors .

"Editor's note: CNN contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose current book is ""When We Get to Surf City: A Journey Through America in Pursuit of Rock and Roll, Friendship, and Dreams."" ""Tumbling tumbleweeds"" have been romanticized in song, but they're no fun in some parts of the U.S. (CNN) -- ""Do we like them?"" Patrick Victor, a game and fish commission employee in San Carlos, Arizona, repeated the question back to me as if I had proved my lunacy by asking it in the first place. ""Do we like tumbleweeds?"" he said. ""No one likes them. They're not like in the cowboy movies. We consider them garbage -- worse than garbage. There is nothing to treasure or cherish about a tumbleweed."" We were talking about tumbleweeds because of a theory I had been pondering: . In this country, because of the immediacy of news, it seems as if everyone from one coast to the other is worrying obsessively about the same thing at the same time. You name it: the banking meltdown one day, the feared floods in Fargo, North Dakota, the next; the forced ouster of the head of General Motors one morning, followed soon after by the street demonstrations in London during the Group of 20 summit. We all tend to fret together about one crisis at a time; undoubtedly there will be something new for all of us to be nervous about together before sundown tonight. So the goal here was to come up with something utterly unlikely -- something that, in 2009, you wouldn't think would bother people -- and find out if it does. Tumbleweeds. That, just picked at random, was the test case. ""They can be a pretty big problem out here,"" said Scott McGuire, a code enforcement inspector in Greeley, Colorado. ""When the wind is right, they'll pile up right to the roofline of a house. Seriously -- people can't see out of their windows or even easily get out of their homes."" There was something instructive, even (in an off-kilter way) comforting, about learning this: the affirmation that, in this increasingly monolithic country, there are still local vexations that override the breaking news bulletins on the national networks, that people in one pocket of America are routinely dealing with forces that people a few hundred miles away are blissfully unaware of. Just hearing about it makes life seem somehow more life-size. ""I meant what I said literally,"" McGuire said, continuing on his pinned-in-the-house-by-tumbleweeds theme. ""They are big and prickly -- they can blow for hundreds of miles, sometimes all the way from Wyoming. They go until the wind dies out or they run into something. That's when people can have piles of them pressing against their homes -- when the tumbleweeds stop there."" Tumbleweeds, if you haven't thought about them in years, may seem like a gauzy memory from old Western movies, a nostalgic high-plains symbol of desolation and loneliness. There was that campfire song by Roy Rogers and his group, the Sons of the Pioneers; once you think of the lyrics and melody again, you can't get it out of your head: . ""See them tumbling down/Pledging their love to the ground/Lonely but free I'll be found/Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds."" But in the 21st century? In our connected-by-broadband, addicted-to-cell phones, technologically tethered nation? Tumbleweeds? As something to be concerned about? ""They're ugly and nasty,"" said Charlene Hardin, the county manager of Roosevelt County, New Mexico. ""They can make our roads impassable. You can see 12-foot-high, chain-link fences with tumbleweeds piled all the way up to the top. They're very flammable -- toss a cigarette, and you have a big fire. ""Tumbleweeds are more than a nuisance out here. We'll get complaints from people who can't even get out of their own driveways because the tumbleweeds have them hemmed in."" Tumbleweeds are mainly a plague in the West and Southwest: certainly not dire on the level of, say, a national security issue, but a perpetual pain in the neck. They're a gnarled and unpleasant-looking plant, useless as a crop or nutritionally; they dry up, separate from their roots and blow across the land, spreading seeds. They're thorny, are often painful to the touch and can grow as big as trash bags -- it's not uncommon to see tumbleweeds 4 feet in diameter rolling speedily along. As Velda Bucklen, who lives west of Kersey, Colorado, and who was concerned about people just heaving errant tumbleweeds off their property and thus onto nearby lawns, wrote in a letter to the editor of her local newspaper: ""They are prickly and strong. ... I have been guilty of tossing them into the street and sending them on their way. .... Please don't fight with your neighbors."" The people of the United States, though, are nothing if not resourceful. Just as you may have been unaware that tumbleweeds are a contemporary problem, so you may be heartened to learn that, as always, where some people see bad news, others see opportunity. ""I thought there might be some money in tumbleweeds,"" said Linda Katz of Garden City, Kansas. She was right. She runs a company called Prairie Tumbleweed Farm (its motto is ""If they don't tumble, we don't sell them!""), and she said she has found a steady mail-order market for tumbleweeds. ""Personally I'm not fond of them, but apparently some people are,"" she said. ""They're just big, rolling weeds. But people order them for wedding decorations. People order them for dances. Servicemen say tumbleweeds remind them of home. I've taken two orders already today."" Finding them is not a challenge: ""They just roll by the house."" She grabs them, puts them in boxes and mails them off. And, to answer your question before you can ask it: $25 for a large tumbleweed, $15 for a small. Before we leave this topic so we can all return to more conventional news, a word from Bob Lee, director of weed and pest control in Cheyenne, Wyoming: . ""I've seen people here who have gone away for a two-week vacation, and when they come back, there are so many tumbleweeds in front of their house that they have to chop their way to the front door."" So, Mr. Lee, is there one stirring and inspirational parting message you'd like to convey to people? ""Just that tumbleweeds don't have any redeeming features, as far as I'm aware of."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: National issues such as economic crisis dominate news .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The crown of the Statue of Liberty will re-open to tourists on July 4, the Interior Department said Friday. The Statue of Liberty welcomes visitors, immigrants, and returning Americans. The crown was closed after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, for safety and security reasons. The National Park Service closed the attraction amid worries that it would be difficult for visitors to evacuate quickly in the event of an emergency. Visitors must climb a narrow 168-step double-helix spiral staircase to get to the crown. Since the closing, tourists have been able to visit other parts of the statue. iReport.com: Show us your best Statue of Liberty shots . The federal government planned to give ""America a special gift"" by re-opening the crown, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said. ""We are once again inviting the public to celebrate our great nation and the hope and opportunity it symbolizes by climbing to Lady Liberty's crown for a unique view of New York Harbor, where the forebears of millions of American families first saw the world,"" he said in a statement. Access to the crown will be limited to 10 people at a time, guided by a National Park Service ranger. ""We cannot eliminate all the risk of climbing to the crown, but we are taking steps to make it safer,"" Salazar said. The measures include raising the handrails on the spiral staircase and stationing rangers throughout the Statue to help visitors. The Statue of Liberty will be open for the next two years, then closed again for ""work on a long-term solution that will improve safety and security permanently,"" according to the U.S. Department of the Interior. A gift from France to the United States, the Statue of Liberty was dedicated in 1886, designated as a National Monument in 1924 and restored for its centennial on July 4, 1986. It stands just across New York Harbor from where the Twin Towers stood.","The crown has been closed since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Nearly 27 years ago, amid a crowd of people in Central Park, Ruth Bendik's wallet was stolen. The culprit is still at large, but the wallet has been found -- in the hollow trunk of a cherry tree. Nearly 27 years ago, amid a crowd of people in Central Park, Ruth Bendik's wallet was stolen. The wallet was snatched on October 24, 1982, while Bendik, now 69, was in Central Park watching the New York marathon. She went to greet runners at the end of the race and, ""when I got out of the crush of people, I realized my purse was much lighter,"" Bendik told CNN. ""I was just so grateful not to have been harmed."" Last week, Josh Galiley, tree-care supervisor for the Central Park Conservancy, was chopping down a hazardous black cherry tree near Rumsey Playfield when he discovered her blue leather wallet in the trunk of the tree, which he estimates is around 65 years old and 50 feet high. ""I started poking in the soft stuff and this wallet turned up. Having been that low in the tree ... the location indicated it had been there for quite some time,"" Galiley told CNN. The old wallet was a unique find, he said. ""When you're cutting a tree and it's hollow, you expect stuff inside, shreds of material, old marbles, really just knickknacks compared to this,"" he said, ""Nothing with a story. ... We peeked in and there were dates from the early '80s. We figured this was different."" After the wallet was recovered, Galiley said, officials were careful to inform Bendik properly. ""We thought she may not want to relive it,"" he said. Bendik sang praises for the individuals who returned her wallet, including detective Frank Irizarry, who helped track her down. ""The lengths they went to find me, the extent that they went through and the fact that they were concerned about my feelings really impressed me,"" she said. The wallet still contained her old driver's license and credit cards, she said, although $20 was missing. ""Twenty dollars was a lot of money then,"" she said. After two decades, much more has changed. Referring to two of her old bank cards from Manufacturers Hanover Trust Bank and Banker's Trust, Bendik said, ""I was shocked that both banks had closed."" But some things haven't changed. Bendik continues to have fond memories of Central Park. The Ohio native, who has lived in New York for 40 years, still describes the park as one of her favorite areas in the city. ""It's a public place in an impersonal city,"" she said, ""It brings everyone together in a pleasant way of reconnecting with nature and beauty."" Today, Bendik smiles at the idea of her wallet buried in a cherry tree in Central Park for nearly 30 years, and she's happy to have it in her hands again. ""After all these years it's still available as a time capsule of my life.""","Ruth Bendik's wallet was snatched in 1982 during the New York marathon .

"(CNN)  -- Darren Tuck, the man who gave police a tape depicting the rape of a 3-year-old girl, turned himself in Sunday to Nye County, Nevada, authorities. Darren Tuck turned himself in to authorities Sunday. He earlier gave police the tape of the girl. Tuck had recently given police the videotape, saying he found it in the desert, Sheriff Tony De Meo said. Police said he had the tape for at least five months before turning it in. He was being sought on a parole violation for failure to pay child support, but police -- who have said they want to question him further -- had been unable to locate him. Tuck, of Nevada, allegedly showed the tape to others, and faces between 10 years to life in prison for exhibiting pornography and one to six years for possession of child pornography, said De Meo. Tuck's attorney Harry Kuehn said last week on CNN's ""Nancy Grace"" that Tuck had been ""wracked by indecision"" as to what to do with the tape once he realized what it was. ""You have to consider what kind of concerns my client had,"" the attorney said. ""He's previously dealt with the sheriff's office in Nye County; it was previously unsatisfactory."" The four-year-old videotape shows the 3-year-old girl being raped in Las Vegas, Nevada. Last week, she was found safe. Now seven, the girl was found Friday with family in Las Vegas after thousands of tips poured in to police, thanks to an appeal by police to the news media to show the girl's picture. CNN and other news organizations did so until the child was found, and De Meo asked media to stop showing the picture. ""The mother has cooperated with us,"" De Meo said. ""We believe that the mother was not aware of anything that went on with this young girl. It was very sad for her to find this out."" Authorities have identified Chester A. Stiles, 37, as the suspect in the tape. A  resident of Pahrump, Nevada, he remains at-large, De Meo said. Pahrump is about 60 miles west of Las Vegas. Stiles was a distant friend of the girl's family, De Meo said. Someone close to Stiles told investigators Stiles is a ""survivalist type"" and always carries a weapon, Nye County District Attorney Bob Beckett said. Todd Allen, a Las Vegas resident, told CNN he once lived with the girl from the video and her mother. He said he recognizes his old apartment from scenes in the video. He said he knows the suspect because Allen's mother dated Stiles and the couple spent time together at Allen's apartment.  Watch Allen describe Stiles and the girl » . Allen said nobody realized the child had been abused. ""She's what you'd expect a little girl in elementary school to be like,"" he said. ""You would never know something like that happened. Ever."" Allen said he never witnessed Stiles physically assault anyone. ""But I have seen him verbally and mentally assault many people,"" Allen told CNN. ""He's good with mind games. He's good at twisting people's realities and manipulating people."" De Meo addressed Stiles directly on Saturday: ""Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency,"" he said. ""Understand this: Law enforcement not only has a long arm, but a long memory. You will not be forgotten by members of this agency or any other law enforcement agency."" The FBI is also seeking Stiles on state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14 in a separate matter, De Meo said.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Mat Kearney has every right to be frustrated. Mat Kearney's music has gotten a boost through music video channels and ""Grey's Anatomy."" As he walks to his tour bus behind Hollywood's Palladium -- where he'll play in a few hours -- he's already had to cope with logistical snafus, shortened sound checks and general confusion. And the tour is just beginning. There are more than 30 cities and 10 weeks to come. But as he approaches the bus, he is completely overtaken by an obscure flower hanging off a fence behind the venue. ""I've never seen anything like that,"" he says, looking at the blue-and-white bloom. ""I've got to take one of these."" Kearney should be smelling the flowers. His music, such as the song ""Nothing Left to Lose,"" has received consistent airplay on music TV channels -- which earned him a headlining slot on a VH1-sponsored tour -- and repeated appearances in TV and film. Most notably, ""Grey's Anatomy"" used his song ""Breathe In, Breathe Out."" His new album, ""City of Black & White"" (Aware/Columbia), is out Tuesday.  Watch the video for the single ""Closer to Love"" » . The Oregon-born musician, 30, sat down with CNN to talk about his songwriting journey, combining a big sound with personal observations and a certain ""weird TV show."" The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: How important was Nashville, Tennessee, in your decision to be a songwriter? Mat Kearney: The first year I moved to Nashville, I started playing these songwriter nights with people like Nickel Creek, Duncan Sheik and even Ryan Adams. ... That was the first place I really started playing music and I had to really step up my game. Really quick. Or get kicked off the stage. CNN: This whirlwind world tour you completed last year -- how did it impact this new album and you personally? Kearney: That tour was three years long. [So] this record was a return back to community in Nashville and to sing. ... So, [the tour] created this void for wanting to connect in a local way. So many things happen when you're not out there running and gunning. Falling in love with someone, getting your heart broken, being around friends -- that stuff can only happen when you stick around for a while. CNN: What's the significance of the title -- ""City of Black & White""? Kearney: The title track I wrote in Istanbul. We stayed in this place that overlooked the Bosporus, which splits Europe from Asia. The song is about worlds colliding, being that far away from home, and also longing to be with someone you love in that distant land. ... It seemed like a good cornerstone to build the record on. CNN: You're an avid traveler, but this record is more concerned with planting roots. How do you reconcile the two? Kearney: I don't think, to be a traveler, you have to reject setting roots up. That's the fun of this whole journey for me. There are people I love in Nashville and would not want to go a day without talking to, but I want to see the world. The record is coming out of an experience of reconciling those two things. I played 275 shows for two years straight. You have to travel between those shows. So you're gone. Some of those experiences shape the record. There's a romantic side to it. This isn't a one-night stand record. It's not youthful idealism that's going after the masses. There's some ideas of, say, that prodigal son who has walked away from you and you're sitting there saying, ""I'm here for you if you need me."" CNN: The sound is big but the lyrics are intensely personal. How did you meld those ideas together? Kearney: Yeah, it's like the biggest song is one of the most personal. ""Fire and Rain"" [not the James Taylor song] is a crazy four-on-the-floor song, but it's a song about someone who has left you. Something about the juxtaposition of those two seem so interesting to me. I didn't plan it. It just kind of happened. CNN: You're one of the last musicians I have seen actually get airplay on [music television channels], and you broke through because of it. Kearney: It's interesting how my music has gained success being accompanied by images. When I was in college I wanted to study film. My first passion was to be a cinematographer. So maybe there's something innate in my music where it partners well with images. It's worked on weird TV shows where doctors are making out and people getting logs pulled out of their stomachs [laughs]. Somehow my music seems to work with that. CNN: How did your music become such an integral part of that show [""Grey's Anatomy""]? Kearney: I really don't know. Somebody somewhere ... started using these songs and they seem to work. There are certain songs that lend themselves to images. No one's licensing [Katy Perry's] ""I Kissed a Girl"" and putting it in shows. That's a narrow-focused message that doesn't need much [in the way of] images.","Mat Kearney enjoys growing success; new album is ""City of Black & White""

"(CNN) -- A 3-year-old boy who was taken at gunpoint from his California home nearly two weeks ago has been found, authorities said Saturday. Briant Rodriguez, 3, was taken during a home invasion on May 3 in San Bernardino, California, police say. Briant Rodriguez was found wandering the streets of Mexicali, Mexico, by a police officer late Thursday, said San Bernardino County Sheriff Rod Hoops. After clearing paperwork with Mexican officials, California authorities reunited the boy with his mother Saturday in the border town of Calexico, Hoops said. ""We're very happy that he's alive,"" Hoops said. ""A 3-year-old goes missing in this country for two weeks -- sometimes it has an unhappy ending. ""This one did not.""  Watch portion of sheriff's news conference » . The boy had been missing since May 3, when two men armed with handguns burst into his family's home and tied him up -- along with his mother and four siblings. The men ransacked the home before leaving with Briant, a small amount of cash and some personal property, San Bernardino sheriff's spokeswoman Cindy Beavers said. Authorities had not caught the suspects as of Saturday evening. Hoops said authorities have information about at least two suspects -- who were captured on video at a home-improvement store near the Rodriguez home buying tape like the kind that was used to bind the family. He said the names of the suspects, and what authorities believe was a motive, are not being released because they could jeopardize the investigation. He also declined to say what relationship the suspects may have had with the family or whether the kidnapping is linked with drug crime that has run rampant in Mexican border towns in recent months. Members of drug cartels in the border region have been known to use kidnapping as a means of quick cash. ""If you take a look at the case, I'll let you do your own homework on it,"" Hoops told reporters. Authorities from San Bernardino flew to Mexico late Friday to get Briant. Hoops said he appears to be in good health. His hair, which is shoulder-length in photographs that authorities had released, had apparently been shaved, Hoops said. Hoops said Briant's mother is ""a Mexican citizen living here in the United States,"" but that he is unsure of her immigration status. He said Briant was born in the United States. Sgt.

"(CNN) -- Mexican President Felipe Calderon's ruling party paid the price for a weak economy in midterm elections as the opposition Revolutionary Institutional Party rolled to victories in the lower legislative house as well as state and local posts. Mexican President Felipe Calderon wasn't on Sunday's ballot and has three years left in his six-year term. With more than 99 percent of the votes counted, the PRI had 36.7 percent to 28 percent for Calderon's National Action Party (PAN), the state-run Notimex news agency reported Monday. The leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), which nearly won the 2006 presidential election, came in a distant third with 12.2 percent of the vote. In response to the defeat, PAN president German Martinez resigned from the top party post Monday. On the ballot were seats for 500 federal legislators, six governors and about 500 mayors and local legislators in 11 states. Though Calderon has three years left in his six-year term and was not on the ballot, analysts said Monday he was held responsible for Mexico's problems amid the global economic downturn. ""He got a beating because of the economy,"" said Ana Maria Salazar, a television and radio political commentator in Mexico City. ""The government in power pays for it,"" said Peter Hakim, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue. Besides the economy, Calderon has had to face the consequences of a drug war he launched that has left more than 10,000 people dead since he came to office in December 2006. He also had to deal with the H1N1 flu pandemic that first became known in Mexico this year. The PAN has the most seats in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Mexico's Congress, but it does not have a majority in either. The party lost its lead in the lower house, as the PRI will hold more seats when the new delegates are seated in December. No seats were at stake in the Senate, which elects its members every six years. Calderon acknowledged the setback in a late-night address to the nation Sunday. ""The federal government recognizes the new composition of the Chamber of Deputies since it is a sovereign decision of the citizens. I congratulate who they have chosen,"" Calderon said, adding he will work with the new representatives. He will have no choice but to work with the resurgent PRI, analysts said. But since the PAN did not have control of either house of Congress, Calderon has been compromising and making deals with the PRI and other parties since coming to power. ""I don't think the job is much more difficult than it was at the outset,"" Hakim said. ""It's all a matter of degrees. Yeah, it will make it a little more difficult. But he has had to work through negotiation anyway."" Still, analysts said, the PRI now wields considerable more power. ""They're in a position to run Congress,"" said Andrew Selee, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center's Mexico Institute. By forming temporary coalitions with the Green Party and other minor parties, the PRI can block presidential vetoes, Salazar said. ""They pretty much have control over the purse,"" she said. Much more is at stake for the PRI though. After having held the presidency from 1929 to 2000 and then losing it to the PAN in the last two elections, the party is looking for a path back to power. Sunday's results were particularly significant because the PRI finished third in the 2006 presidential election. ""The presidential campaign has started as of today, Monday,"" Salazar said. Also significant was the PRD's apparent collapse as a major party, considering it came within 1 percent of winning the presidency in 2006. That race was so close that the results were not verified until a controversial decision two months later. Losing candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador refused to accept the results and announced himself the winner. Fistfights broke out in the Chamber of Deputies. The PRI drew away votes from the PRD in Sunday's election, Hakim said, noting that may help Calderon because the PRD is Calderon's main foe in Congress. Working with a larger PRI may be easier. But Selee said Calderon is on a deadline, until the 2012 presidential race really heats up. ""His window of opportunity is for the next year and half,"" Selee said. ""The PRI wants to show that they can lead, that they're a party of ideas."" No one knows if the PRI is up to the task. ""The big question is whether the PRI will look forward only to the presidential elections,"" Hakim said. ""The PRI has to show that they're responsible and capable of governing again."" To do so, the PRI has to make sure that internal fighting over who will run as the presidential candidate in three years does not paralyze the party. ""Don't underestimate the ability of the PRI to cannibalize itself,"" Salazar said. PRI leader Beatriz Paredes has emerged as a major power broker. As head of the party and newly elected member of the Chamber of Deputies, she will lead the PRI's legislative efforts. That's good for Calderon, Salazar said, because it will be ""much easier to negotiate with her than with other factions of the PRI."" But if the PAN and PRI can't agree, Selee said, ""there will be a breakdown of consensus politics."" Mexico's leaders -- regardless of party affiliation -- also have to battle apparent disenchantment among everyday Mexicans. Voter participation Sunday was about 30 percent, officials said, but more 5 percent of those were people who ""annulled"" their ballots. They turned in a ballot but did not vote for anyone or defaced the ballot. Their intent was to show that they cared enough to vote, just not for anyone on the ballot. ""It's a repudiation of what is going on in Mexico in general,"" Salazar said. Selee sees ""a general skepticism,"" saying, ""Mexicans have tired of where things are going.""","NEW: German Martinez, president of PAN political party, resigns in aftermath .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Four decades after he won over America with his scratchy, soulful voice and blues-inspired rock, British-born Joe Cocker is receiving an honor from the queen. Joe Cocker is being honored at Buckingham Palace for his services to music. Cocker, 63, was set to receive an OBE, or Order of the British Empire, at a ceremony Thursday morning at Buckingham Palace. The award officially recognizes Cocker's ""services to music."" Prince Charles was planning to present Cocker with the honor, part of the queen's annual birthday honors list. Famous for songs including ""You Are So Beautiful"" and his cover of the Beatles' ""With a Little Help from My Friends,"" Cocker began his career by singing Ray Charles songs in pubs around his hometown of Sheffield, northern England in the early 1960s. Cocker toured with a string of bands, often playing American airbases in Europe, winning fans among the servicemen. The press hailed his first U.S. television performance on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1969, and the following summer, Cocker played to half a million people at the historic Woodstock rock festival in New York state. The ensuing live album ""Mad Dogs and Englishmen"" remains a Cocker classic, with songs including ""Cry Me A River"" and ""Feelin' Alright."" Rolling Stone magazine says Cocker's ""gritty, powerful voice remains one of the most distinctive in rock & roll.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- White supremacists, Islamic clerics, a controversial Kansas pastor and a U.S. talk show host are on a list of 22 people banned from Britain for ""stirring up hatred,"" the British government said Tuesday. Jacqui Smith said she did not hesitate to name and shame those who foster extremist views. Britain's Home Office said it decided to exclude the 22 in the last several months. The decision follows measures introduced by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith last year against people ""who have engaged in spreading hate,"" the Home Office said. The Home Office named only 16 of those on the list; it said it was not in the public interest to disclose the names of the other six. A spokeswoman declined to elaborate on why the Home Office would not publicly identify six of the 22. One of the most recognized names on the list may be U.S. radio talk show host Michael Savage, who is listed under his real name, Michael Alan Wiener. The conservative's daily show can be heard nationwide in the United States. Savage is on the list for ""seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence."" Savage lashed out at Smith on his Web site, calling her a ""witch"" and asking how she knew of his show when it isn't syndicated in England. He also questioned why six names on the list weren't released and why North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez didn't make the list. In an audio clip on his Web site, Savage said he had seven attorneys working on a defamation lawsuit against Smith and encouraged his listeners to call off any travel plans to England and boycott all British products. ""She has painted a target on my back, linking me with people who are in prison for killing people,"" he said. ""How could they put Michael Savage in the same league as mass murderers when I have never avowed violence?"" Outspoken Kansas Rev. Fred Phelps and his daughter, Shirley Phelps-Roper, are also listed for ""engaging in unacceptable behavior and fostering hatred."" Phelps and his followers at Westboro Baptist Church oppose homosexuality. They picket the funerals of soldiers killed in Iraq, saying their deaths are God's way of punishing the United States for supporting homosexuals. They have expressed similar views about the victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks and Hurricane Katrina. The church's slogan is ""God Hates Fags."" Phelps did not issue a response on his Web site. However, he linked to a British news story on the ban and wrote his own headline, calling Smith a ""neo-Nazi dyke"" and ""filthy God-hater."" Former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard Don Black, who has said he despises U.S. President Barack Obama, is also on the list. Black established the white supremacist Web site Stormfront, which the Home Office called one of the oldest and largest hate group sites. Eric Gliebe, chairman of the National Alliance, one of the largest neo-Nazi groups in the United States, is on the list for ""justifying terrorist violence, provoking others to commit serious crime and fostering racial hatred."" The Home Office cited Gliebe's ""Web-radio broadcasts in which he vilifies certain ethnic groups and encourages the download and distribution of provocative racist leaflets and posters."" Several Islamic clerics are also on the list, including Abdullah Qadri Al Ahdal, Amir Siddique, Yunis Al Astal and Safwat Hijazi. Prolific speaker and writer Wadgy Abd El Hamied Mohamed Ghoneim is also listed. The list includes Mike Guzofsky, the leader of a militant Jewish group. He has ties to Kahane Chai, a group that the U.S. State Department lists as a foreign terrorist organization. Russian skinheads Artur Ryno and Pavel Skachevsky are also on the list. The Home Office says they are ""leaders of a violent gang that beat migrants and posted films of their attacks on the Internet."" Samir al Quntar, a Lebanese man who spent three decades in prison for killing four Israeli soldiers and a 4-year-old girl in 1979, is also on the list. In an exchange with the militant group Hezbollah, Israel freed al Quntar last year for the bodies of two Israeli soldiers. Al Quntar is ""engaging in unacceptable behavior by seeking to foment, justify or glorify terrorist violence"" in order to provoke terrorist acts, the Home Office said. Nasr Javed and Abdul Ali Musa round out the 16 names made public. ""Coming to the UK is a privilege, and I refuse to extend that privilege to individuals who abuse our standards and values to undermine our way of life,"" Smith said. ""Therefore, I do not hesitate to name and shame those who foster extremist views, as I want them to know that they are not welcome here. ""The government opposes extremism in all its forms and I am determined to stop those who want to spread extremism, hatred and violent messages in our communities from coming to our country,"" she said. ""This is the driving force behind tighter rules on exclusions for unacceptable behavior.""","NEW: Talk show host calls home secretary ""witch""; reverend calls her ""neo-Nazi""

"(CNN) -- Staff Sgt. Bartek Bachleda doesn't consider himself a hero, but passengers on a recent jumbo jet flight might beg to differ. Staff Sgt. Bartek Bachleda says he knew the plane he was riding in was losing fuel and videotaped the problem. One of 300 passengers on a United Airlines flight from Chicago, Illinois, to Tokyo, Japan, in April, Bachleda noticed white ""smoke"" billowing from the left side of the Boeing 747-400 jet on takeoff and then again at cruising altitude of over 30,000 feet. He said he was sure it was a leak, a big one that could lead to a potentially dangerous situation. Bachleda, 30, should know. He serves in an air refueling squadron in the U.S. Air Force. He videotaped the midair vapor from his window seat and tried to warn a flight attendant. But at first, she paid him no heed. ""When I initially hit the call button, she thought maybe I wanted something, and she said, 'Sir, I'm handing out drinks, I'll be right back with you,' "" Bachleda said. Undeterred, Bachleda called her back to his seat. ""Ma'am,"" he said. ""It's looking bad."" He identified himself and showed the flight attendant his video. ""I decided, if the captain doesn't know about this before we go oceanic -- meaning once we fly over the ocean -- and we're leaking this massive amount of fuel, this is going to be a bad day,"" said Bachleda, on a return trip back to Kadena Air Base in Japan, where he is stationed. This time the flight attendant took him seriously, immediately stopped serving drinks and alerted the flight crew.  Watch more on the plane leak » . United Airlines spokesman Jeff Kovick said the crew was already aware of the situation and was considering what action to take when Bachleda brought it to their attention. He said the captain would never have attempted a Pacific crossing. In Bachleda's estimation, the plane, which United said has a capacity of 373,000 pounds of jet fuel, was losing about 6,000 pounds an hour. Over the course of a 13-hour flight, the plane would have lost about 20 percent of its tank. But a former NTSB official said the plane still would have had to land because it lacked extra fuel to divert once it was over the Pacific or circle at its destination. The jet landed in San Francisco, California -- with all 300 passengers safe.","Passenger notices white smoke billowing from plane's left side on flight to Japan .

"(CNN) -- AC Milan have swooped to sign Standard Liege defender Oguchi Onyewu on a three-year contract -- making him the first American to appear in Serie A since Alexi Lalas in 1996. Onyewu will become the first American since Alexi Lalas to appear in Italian Serie A after joining AC Milan. Onyewu, who has also played in the English Premier League with Newcastle United, has moved to the San Siro on a free transfer after impressing with some superb displays during the United States' run to the Confederations Cup final. The 27-year-old has played 38 times for his country, scoring five goals.Latest transfer gossip and rumors . ""This transaction shows once again the excellent friendly relationship between our club and Belgian club Standard Liege, particularly their executive vice-president Luciano D'Onofrio,"" said a statement on Milan's official Web site. The six-foot four-inch player was born in Washington DC to Nigerian parents but began his club career at Metz in France in 2002. He was loaned out to La Louviere in Belgium in 2003 and his form there earnt him a move to Liege, where he won two Belgian titles. He then joined Newcastle on loan, playing 11 league matches. However, the  transfer is unlikely to appease the Milan supporters who are unhappy with the summer sale of Brazilian superstar Kaka to Real Madrid -- and the departure of coach Carlo Ancelotti to Chelsea. About 300 fans protested outside the club's Milanello base on the first day of pre-season training on Monday, complaining at the lack of big name signings.","AC Milan swoop to sign up American international defender Oguchi Onyewu .

"Editor's note: On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. Christine Quinn, speaker of the New York City Council, and her partner, Kim Catullo, talk to John King. NEW YORK (CNN)  -- As she lobbies members of the New York Senate these days, the politician in Christine Quinn can understand what the gay rights activist in her sometimes cannot. ""The fear of the unknown,"" is how she describes it. ""This is a vote they've never cast before. And they don't know how people are going to react. You are in a position where people's reaction to you is the key to your success. And the unknown creates fear and fear often creates paralysis."" Quinn is the openly gay speaker of the New York City Council, and a proponent of legalizing same sex marriage in New York state. ""It is really encouraging to see what's happening around the country in places where you really wouldn't expect it, like Iowa,"" says Quinn's longtime partner, Kim Catullo. ""To be in a place like New York and not have it just doesn't seem to make sense."" The New York Assembly passed legislation allowing same-sex marriages earlier this month, and the question now is whether there are enough votes in the state Senate to pass the legislation before the legislature adjourns for the year. Go behind the scenes with John King as he discusses his report from New York . Quinn, who spent time in Albany this past week meeting with undecided senators, is cautiously optimistic. ""It was amazing how much openness there was,"" she said of private meetings with lawmakers who are undecided and even a few who have said they are likely to oppose the legislation. ""We just all have to create a moment for them to step forward. So I really think it is going to happen this month, before the legislative session is over."" Maggie Gallagher sees the Senate math quite differently. ""We are now working in 24 Senate districts,"" says Gallagher, president of the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriages. ""We know we have generated thousands of phone calls to legislators. I don't think they will be passing a gay marriage bill this session.""  Watch both sides assess chances of passing same-sex marriage bill » . The New York legislation is part of a growing national debate, and one which will gain even more attention because of the U.S. Supreme Court vacancy and the nomination of federal appeals court judge Sonia Sotomayor to fill it. ""Not tomorrow. Not likely in the coming year unless the courts move dramatically faster than we are used to seeing them move,"" is how Columbia Law School Professor Suzanne Goldberg answers when asked when the issue of same-sex marriage is likely to make the Supreme Court docket. ""But certainly some time in the next couple of years we're likely to see the Supreme Court issue a position or two on this issue."" Goldberg knows Sotomayer well; the judge is also a lecturer at Columbia. ""We've never spoken about the issue,"" Goldberg told us. ""I have no inside information about her views. What I would say is that she is both a wise person and a thoughtful person and being wise and thoughtful are the right ingredients for reaching what to me is the right answer on this issue, which to me is that equality applies to all people."" The likelihood of the issue reaching the Supreme Court in the next year or two raises the stakes in the state battles. Opponents of California's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage vow to try again in 2010 in hopes of a different result. A new federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of California's Proposition 8 was filed this week and could well be among the cases that make it to the Supreme Court eventually. Five states now allow same-sex marriage: Maine, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts and Vermont, and the states with active debates include California, New York, New Jersey and New Hampshire. In an interview in their apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York, Quinn and Catullo agreed the ideal solution for them would be federal recognition of the right of same-sex couples to marry. But the federal Defense of Marriage Act signed by President Clinton defines marriage as between a man and a woman. And President Obama says he supports civil unions and other benefits for same-sex couples but opposes marriage. ""He's not perfect on this issue and I want him to be perfect,"" Quinn said of Obama. ""And I'm fairly certain that pretty soon he will be perfect on this issue and what we just have to do is keep talking to him and keep educating him and keep working on him."" ""It doesn't help,"" Catullo says of Obama's opposition. Still, like Quinn, she hopes eventually, ""he can evolve."" Gallagher, of the National Organization for Marriage, is worried more about the high court than any pressure on Obama from gay rights activists. ""Well I don't believe David Souter was on our side on the gay marriage issue although we don't know for sure,"" Gallagher said. So in her line of speculating, swapping Sotomayor for Souter isn't likely to swing the court in any major way. Her major worry is if one of the more conservative judges decided to retire in the near future. ""I don't think this one is going to tip the balance,"" Gallagher said. ""But we're very close. We're probably only one Supreme Court justice away from a nationally imposed right to same-sex marriage whether we like it or not. That is the ultimate game plan of the gay marriage forces."" Catullo would prefer a conversation less political. ""I really do believe that if someone lived next to us or really knew us, it wouldn't be an issue at all,"" she said. ""I mean we are good people. We're law-abiding. We're taxpayers. We're just an eight-year couple that's been together a long time and we do a lot of the things that a normal couple does. There's a lot more things in the world to worry about than the fact that we want to be married.""","N.Y. Assembly passed bill allowing same-sex marriages; willl state Senate pass it?

"(CNN) -- Georgian authorities foiled an attempted army mutiny that they believe was designed to disrupt planned NATO exercises in the former Soviet republic, the country's interior ministry said Tuesday. Georgian troops take part in military exercises in January. They are to participate in NATO maneuvers this week. About 500 troops at a military base outside the capital, Tbilisi, were involved in the rebellion, said Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili. He said it was quickly brought under control, and the government reported a few hours later that the base was calm. Initial investigations suggest that Russia, Georgia's northern neighbor and former ruler, may have had a hand in the mutiny, Utiashvili said. Russia denied involvement in the incident. ""Tbilisi has pulled yet another anti-Russian prank. ... This is not the first time we are so vocally blamed for interfering. It is typical that each time the charges become more ridiculous,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Utiashvili claimed that Georgia had secret recordings of the mutineers saying they had ""full Russian support."" ""We know Russia is against the planned NATO exercises in Georgia. We know they have increased the troops at the border. We don't have 100 percent evidence right now, because the investigation is ongoing,"" he said. But, he added, until the investigation is complete, officials won't point a finger at Russia. On Tuesday afternoon, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili called on Russia to stop ""provocative maneuvers"" in Georgia, according to Georgia's English-language Prime News. Russia and Georgia fought a five-day war in August over the breakaway Georgian province of South Ossetia, the first time Russia sent troops abroad in anger since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. NATO is expected to launch month-long military exercises this week in Georgia. The move has angered Russia, which accused the alliance of ""muscle-flexing."" ""All kinds of things have been said,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said. ""But it has never before been claimed that Russia is trying to overthrow the Georgian government with the help of the Georgian armed forces. In this regard, we once again reiterate that Russia does not interfere in the internal affairs of Georgia on principle. We do not believe in scripts imposed from the outside."" NATO said it had no comment on the incident because it did not independently confirm the event. However, a NATO spokeswoman in Brussels said Tuesday that exercises planned for Wednesday are ""still on"" and that ""nothing has changed"" after the attempted mutiny. ""The timing chosen by Tbilisi for its latest action is telling: the day before the start of NATO exercises in Georgia,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said. ""We strongly warned our partners that the exercises were absolutely inappropriate in the current highly charged atmosphere within Georgia and the region. Our warnings were not heeded."" Georgia's Utiashvili said the rebelling soldiers were heard saying they were ""unhappy with the political situation in the country."" One person was arrested, and authorities are looking for another in connection with the attempted mutiny, Georgia's Ministry of Internal Affairs said. The person in custody, Gia Ghvaladze, served as a major in the Special Forces Department at the now-disbanded Ministry of State Security, Georgian officials said. He is being held on charges of organizing a military mutiny. In an undercover tape released by Georgian officials, a man is heard saying, ""Russians will come. About 5,000 men, two battalions. Can you imagine? Five thousand men. Do you know how big this is?"" CNN could not confirm the authenticity of the tape, but the Georgian government said it implicates Ghvaladze. Authorities said they are looking for the second man, Koba Otanadze, who is wanted for his role in organizing the mutiny. Otanadze helped lead a military mutiny at the same base in May 2001, the Ministry of Internal Affairs said. A third person -- Zaza Mushkudiani, the head of the Georgian ranger battalion -- was also being investigated, the ministry said, but it was unclear whether he was in custody. NATO is expected to launch month-long military exercises this week in Georgia. The move has angered Russia, Georgia's neighbor to the north, which accused the alliance of ""muscle-flexing."" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov postponed his trip to Brussels, Belgium, for the ministerial meeting of the NATO-Russia Council because of the planned NATO exercises, Lavrov told the Itar-Tass news agency. In April, Saakashvili vowed to remain in office until his term ends, defying calls by anti-government protesters that he step down. Up to 60,000 demonstrators took to the streets, blaming the president for leading the country with Russia and plunging it into a political crisis. They also were angry about rising poverty in the country. CNN's Matthew Chance and Nunu Japaridze contributed to this report.","NEW: Georgian authorities release recording of man saying ""Russia will come""

"(CNN) -- As Hayden Henshaw was being rushed to the doctor's office after becoming ill, his father heard that his son's classmates had been struck with the deadly swine flu virus like the one sweeping through Mexico. Swine flu commonly affects pigs and occasionally infects people in contact with pigs. Patrick Henshaw called his wife immediately to have Hayden checked for it. Later, they received the bad news. Hayden had become the third confirmed case of swine flu at his Texas high school. It is a virus that has killed 68 people in Mexico and infected at least eight people in the United States. Health officials arrived at the Henshaws' house Friday and drew blood from the whole family, then told them to stay inside and away from the public, Henshaw told CNN. The whole family is quarantined indefinitely, according to CNN-affiliate KABB. Henshaw said his family was shocked when they got the news about their son. ""Stunned. My wife was having a panic attack,"" Henshaw told the affiliate. U.S. health officials have expressed concern about U.S. cases of a swine flu virus that has similar characteristics to the fatal virus in Mexico. More than 1,000 people have fallen ill in Mexico City in a short period of time, U.S. health experts said. ""This situation has been developing quickly,"" Richard Besser, acting director of the Atlanta, Georgia-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said Friday. ""This is something we are worried about."" Besser said all of the eight U.S. patients have recovered.  Watch for more on the U.S. cases » . New York health officials said Friday they were testing about 75 students at a school in New York City for swine flu after the students exhibited flu-like symptoms this week. A team of state health department doctors and staff went to the St. Francis Preparatory School in the borough of Queens on Thursday after the students reported cough, fever, sore throat, aches and pains. Test results are expected as early as Saturday. The new virus has genes from North American swine influenza, avian influenza, human influenza and a form of swine influenza normally found in Asia and Europe, said Nancy Cox, chief of the CDC's Influenza Division. Swine flu is caused by a virus similar to a type of flu virus that infects people every year but is a strain typically found only in pigs -- or in people who have direct contact with pigs. There have, however, been cases of person-to-person transmission of swine flu, the CDC said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A Senate subcommittee Tuesday tackled one of the most contentious issues in U.S. sports: the fairness of the Bowl Championship Series that decides the top college football team each season. Tim Tebow, right, of the Florida Gators talks to coaches at the 2009 BCS national championship game January 8. Convened by Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the hearing by the Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights subcommittee provided a sounding board for his state's disappointment over the inability of the undefeated University of Utah to qualify for the BCS national championship game last January. The BCS operates under an agreement among the major college football conferences that decides which teams qualify for the biggest bowl games each season, including the national championship game. It also distributes the revenue generated by the bowl games, with the participating members taking part in more of the post-season matches and taking home more money. Every season brings heated debate over the bowl lineup and calls for a playoff system similar to the ones used for every other National Collegiate Athletic Association sport, including small-college football. President Obama has joined many Americans in expressing his preference for a playoff system to decide the nation's top college football team. Hatch complained that the BCS system denies outsiders -- such as Utah of the Mountain West Conference -- a fair chance to compete with major conferences such as the Big 12, Big 10, Pacific 10 and Southeast Conference for a spot in the lucrative bowl games. Last season, he said, Utah went undefeated and gained a BCS berth in the Sugar Bowl against perennial power Alabama, which it defeated 31-17. However, the BCS ranking system prevented Utah from any realistic chance of selection for the national championship game, which pitted two teams that each had one loss on their records, Hatch said. For schools outside what he called the ""privileged conferences,"" the BCS system has ""significant and largely insurmountable obstacles to playing for a national championship,"" Hatch said. University of Utah President Michael Young complained that the BCS system both stifles competition and guarantees the majority of revenue from bowl games to the traditional powers. ""If you can't beat them, eliminate them,"" he said of BCS policy. In response, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Harvey Perlman said the BCS system -- while imperfect -- is the only workable formula that ensures participation by major football powers such as his institution. The BCS recognizes the strength and depth of traditional programs, Perlman said, rejecting Young's argument that Utah has no chance to improve its status. ""There realistically is something Utah could do,"" Perlman said. ""They could play the schedule Nebraska played."" At the same time, Perlman said that uneven odds are part of every university's experience at one time or another. ""It's the same as when Nebraska walks into the NIH [National Institutes of Health] and seeks a federal grant and competes with Harvard,"" he said. ""Theoretically we have the same the chance, but do we really?"" Two anti-trust experts provided conflicting testimony on whether the BCS system violates the Sherman Antitrust Act. Barry Brett of the law firm Troutman Sanders insisted the BCS holds what amounts to an illegal monopoly and ""uses this control to exclude all but its founding members [from] fair access to the competition and control of hundreds of millions of dollars."" In response, William Monts III of Hogan and Hartson noted the BCS members created the national championship game and therefore have the right to determine who participates. He also warned against seeking anti-trust relief in court, saying a ruling against the BCS would end its existence without creating an alternative. ""The peculiar irony of an anti-trust claim is that it is likely to sound the death knell for the playoff system proponents want,"" Monts said.","Convened by GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah .

David Motari, based in Hawaii with the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, is being ""processed for separation"" and received non-judicial punishment, officials said in the statement Wednesday night. The Marine Corps would not specify what that punishment was because of privacy regulations. The statement said Motari received the punishment for his role in the ""episode which generated international attention."" The incident appeared on the Internet web site YouTube in March, sparking outrage from animal rights groups around the world. In the video, Motari is seen throwing the dog off a cliff as it yelps.

Janice Hagar, a spokeswoman for the Marines in San Diego, said Encarnacion shot the video. Marine officials at the Pentagon would not disclose the severity of the disciplinary action against Encarnacion, also because of privacy regulations. CNN did not receive a response from the Marine Corps in San Diego to questions about the case.

"GENEVA, Switzerland (CNN) -- The number of confirmed swine flu cases across the globe kept rising Friday, but some signs of hope emerged in the battle against the worldwide outbreak. Tourists sunbathe wearing surgical masks in the popular Mexican resort of Acapulco. The World Health Organization said Friday that the number of confirmed cases stood at 367 worldwide, including 141 in the United States and 156 in Mexico. Thirteen countries have confirmed cases, the organization said. Meanwhile, researchers worked to develop a vaccine for swine flu, which is also known as 2009 H1N1. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hopes to have a vaccine to manufacturers within a month, said Michael Shaw, lab team leader for the H1N1 response at the CDC. ""We're doing the best we can as fast as we can,"" he said. Yet it would take four to six months from the time the appropriate strain is identified before the first doses become available, said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO director of the Initiative for Vaccine Research. ""Of course we would like to have a vaccine tomorrow. We would have wanted to have it yesterday,"" she said. ""It's a long journey."" She said there is ""no doubt"" that a vaccine can be made ""in a relatively short period of time."" The steps involved in producing a vaccine involve isolating a strain of the virus, which has already been done, and tweaking it so manufacturers can make a vaccine, Kieny said. The tweaked virus will be shipped to manufacturers, who will fine-tune it. Then come more tests before national regulatory agencies decide whether to approve a vaccine. As researchers work, at least one politician at the epicenter of the outbreak expressed optimism Friday. Authorities in Mexico are ""beginning to see evidence that the [virus] might be letting up, and the number of people who have been hospitalized has leveled out in regards to people who are contagious, at least as of yesterday,"" Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard told reporters.  Watch how Mexican authorities are dealing with the outbreak » . ""We do have a problem, but I say this so that we know where we are as a city after we have done all we have done, and in what direction we are heading and how much we have progressed. And what I can say is that we are heading in the right direction."" The WHO said Mexico has 156 confirmed cases and nine deaths. Mexican authorities say they have confirmed 16 deaths and at least 358 cases, and they suspect more than 150 deaths may have been caused by the flu.  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta demystify pandemics » .

In a Cabinet meeting, President Obama on Friday praised the ""extraordinary"" government response to the virus but emphasized that ""we also need to prepare for the long term."" ""Since we know that these kinds of threats can emerge at any moment, even if it turns out that the H1N1 is relatively mild on the front end, it could come back in a more virulent form during the actual flu season, and that's why we are investing in our public health infrastructure.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Despite crushing defeats in the last two elections, Senate Republicans have new ""energy and enthusiasm"" for winning back the majority, according to their leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. A top GOP leader says George W. Bush, politically, was a ""millstone"" around the GOP's neck. ""President Bush had become extremely unpopular, and politically he was sort of a millstone around our necks in both '06 and '08,"" McConnell told reporters Friday. ""We now have the opportunity to be on offense, offer our own ideas and we will win some."" Many of those ideas get presented as amendments to Democratic bills, and even though they're usually defeated, they can draw attention to GOP policy alternatives and force Democrats to take difficult votes. ""They become the way you chart the course for a comeback, which, in this country, always happens at some point,"" McConnell said. ""The pendulum swings."" McConnell said many of the ideas for amendments come from conservative think tanks and other Republican thinkers off Capitol Hill. ""Newt Gingrich, for example, has an idea a minute. Many of those are quite good. Many of those become amendments,"" he said. McConnell also said he doesn't mind the ""party of no"" label Congressional Democrats and the White House give Republicans. ""I don't feel anyone should be apologetic for opposing a bad idea,"" McConnell said. ""I'm not fearful of an effort to demonize dissent."" After being labeled by Democrats the ""party of no"" for criticizing the budget without offering solutions, House Republicans said Thursday that they have come up with a plan B -- though were later criticized for a lack of details. ""Two nights ago, the president said, 'We haven't seen a budget yet out of Republicans.' Well, it's just not true, because here it is, Mr. President,"" House Minority leader Rep. John Boehner said Wednesday as he held up a booklet that he said was a ""blueprint for where we're going."" Watch GOP leaders unveil their 'leaner' budget » . The details of the GOP budget will be presented on the House floor next week, said Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin. ""We're going to show a leaner budget, a budget with lower taxes, lower spending and lower borrowing,"" Ryan said. The blueprint includes familiar Republican proposals to limit ""wasteful"" government spending, cut the size of government and provide incentives to private entities to expand access to health care. It also includes a major overhaul of the tax code, proposing a marginal tax rate of 10 percent for income up to $100,000 and 25 percent for any income above that level. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs laughed off the Republicans' proposal Thursday, joking that their blueprint has more pictures of windmills than charts. ""It's interesting to have a budget that doesn't contain any numbers. I think the 'party of no' has become the 'party of no new ideas,' "" he said at the daily briefing. CNN contributor Paul Begala says that Republicans are simply out of ideas -- and have no one to blame but themselves. ""The Republicans are like an arsonist who complains that the fire department is wasting water. Obama is trying to handle an immediate crisis while also laying the foundation for long-term growth. The Republicans are doing neither,"" Begala said. ""They have no plan to stop the loss of jobs or to get capital markets functioning properly -- and they certainly have no plans for health care, education or energy, which are the keys to both long-term economic growth and long-term deficit reduction."" Begala added: ""If this were 'Sesame Street,' the announcer would be saying, 'This program brought to you by the letters G, O and P ... None of the crises the president is addressing were of his creation. All of them were created or worsened by the Republicans who ran the House of Representatives, Senate and White House for years.""

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- A pathologist hired by the family of one of two women whose mysterious deaths in Thailand drew worldwide attention says her ""lungs were 100 percent congested,"" Jill St. Onge's fiancee and brother said. Jill St. Onge died while vacationing with her fiance at a Thailand resort. ""He said her lung tissue was gone,"" said her brother, Robert St. Onge. The pathologist has not determined what caused her lungs to fail, he said, and a final report on her May 2 death may still be weeks away. But members of St. Onge's family said they feel the pathologist's findings, though preliminary, are enough to contradict public statements made by Thai investigators that St. Onge was the victim of food poisoning. ""I am 99.9 percent sure she did not die of food poisoning,"" said Ryan Kells, St. Onge's fiancee, who was with her when she died. ""She suffocated to death. I am not a doctor, but I know when someone can't breathe."" Kells and St. Onge, both artists from Seattle, were on a three-month vacation through Southeast Asia when they arrived on Thailand's Phi Phi Island. They had gotten engaged while on the trip and were keeping friends and family up to date with their adventures. ""Having a blast,"" Jill St. Onge, 27, wrote about the surroundings in a blog dedicated to the couple's travels. ""Food, drink, sun and warm waters ... what else do ya need?"" The couple's vacation ended tragically when Kells found his fiancee in their hotel room vomiting and unable to breathe. He rushed her to a hospital where she died. St. Onge was healthy and there was no obvious explanation for her sudden death, her brother said. Just hours after St. Onge fell ill, Julie Bergheim, a Norwegian tourist who was staying in a room next to St. Onge's at the Laleena Guesthouse, came down with similar symptoms. She also died. According to Thai media reports, police there are focusing on food poisoning as the cause of the women's deaths. On Monday, the Phuket Gazette quoted a police commander as saying blood samples from both women indicated possible food poisoning from seafood. Still, the commander said, those results were only preliminary. ""I don't know when the official results will be released,"" Maj. Gen. Pasin Nokasul told the newspaper. ""The lab work [is being] expedited because the embassies of the two tourists want to know the cause of death as soon as possible."" Kells response to Nokasul's statement was harsh. ""That she died of food poisoning is a ridiculous statement to make,"" he said, adding it is unlikely they would have been ""the only ones affected."" Dr. William Hurley, medical director for the Washington Poison Center, is also skeptical that food poisoning could have been responsible. In food poisoning cases, he said, ""usually what kills you is the dehydration, not the toxin."" He added, ""Food poisoning is not something that typically kills someone this quickly. It takes days."" Ingestion of a variety of chemicals could have caused Onge and Bergheim's sudden deaths, Hurley said, and could be consistent with the condition of Onge's lungs. But without further information, he said, it is impossible to say what killed the two women. Kells said he thinks something in the hotel where they were where staying made Jill sick. He remembers a ""chemical smell"" in the room and thinks he avoided becoming ill because he spent less time in the room. On Saturday, the Phuket Wan newspaper reported that investigators visited the Laleena Guesthouse, taking samples and removing filters from the air conditioning units in the rooms where both victims had stayed. Rat Chuped, the owner of the hotel, told the newspaper her property was not to blame. ""There is no problem with my guesthouse,"" she said.","Seattle woman is one of 2 tourists who died of unknown causes .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A habitually violent young man was convicted Wednesday of the murder of teenage actor Rob Knox, who had starred in the latest ""Harry Potter"" film. The father, brother and mother of Rob Knox pose together after the death of the young actor. Karl Bishop, 22, attacked Knox and four friends with two kitchen knives outside a bar in Sidcup, south east London, last May. He stabbed them 10 times in less than two minutes, the Old Bailey court in central London heard. Knox, 18, had rushed out of the bar after he heard that Bishop had threatened his younger brother Jamie but he ended up being stabbed five times, once in a main artery. He died in hospital later that night. Bystanders said Bishop's face was ""screwed up in rage"" as he lashed out with the two knives, the Press Association reported. Days before the attack, the actor had finished filming on ""Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince,"" due for international release in July, in which he played the role of Marcus Belby. He was set to reprise the part in future ""Harry Potter"" films. Knox's father Colin told mourners at his funeral, including co-star Rupert Grint, that his son had been ""living the dream,"" PA said. Prosecutor Brian Altman told the court that the young actor's promising life was ended by a ""habitual knife carrier"" who believed stabbing people was an ""occupational hazard"" and had previous convictions for knife crime. Bishop is due to be sentenced on Thursday. Knife crime in Britain is a political hot topic due to a spate of recent killings of mainly young people in major cities. UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has urged tougher sentences for those caught carrying knives. He told the Daily Telegraph last month: ""By carrying a knife you are not only endangering the lives of others, but you are more likely to be killed, or end up in jail. ""We need to change the way young people think about knives, we need families and communities working together ... to get this message across and help stamp out knife crime and get weapons off our streets.""","Man convicted of murder of teenage actor who starred in new ""Harry Potter"" film .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- When Michael Jackson collapsed at his rented mansion last month, the singer's arms were riddled with marks and their veins had collapsed -- both characteristics found in intravenous drug users, sources told CNN on Tuesday. A source says Michael Jackson had ""paper white skin. As white as a white T-shirt."" The revelations add to the speculation that prescription drugs played a part in Jackson's death on June 25. The exact cause is pending toxicology results that aren't due for at least another week. A source involved with the investigation into Jackson's death told CNN that Jackson had ""numerous track marks"" on his arms -- and that those marks ""could certainly be consistent with the regular IV use of a drug, like Diprivan."" The sources did not want to be identified because the investigation is ongoing. The source said investigators found numerous bottles of prescription drugs in the singer's $100,000-a-month rented mansion in Holmby Hills, but he would not confirm whether Diprivan was among them.  Watch what sources say on condition of Jackson's body » . He also cautioned that it was too soon to say whether an intravenous drip of Diprivan caused the track marks. Some appeared fresh; others older, he said. The new ones could have resulted from the IVs that paramedics used when they tried to revive Jackson after he was found unconscious. Another source with knowledge of the case said Jackson's veins were collapsed in both arms, suggesting frequent intravenous drug use. The first source said Jackson's body was ""lily white from head to toe,"" perhaps the result of vitiligo -- a condition that causes the skin to lose melanin and produce slowly enlarging white patches. The second source said Jackson had ""paper white skin. As white as a white T-shirt."" The singer also did not have any hair -- a lingering effect, possibly, of an accident in 1984 when Jackson suffered burns to his scalp while shooting a commercial for Pepsi. Also, said the second source, Jackson was emaciated -- despite the vigor he's seen displaying in a taped rehearsal clip shot two nights before his death. The drug Diprivan, known by its generic name Propofol, is administered intravenously in operating rooms as a general anesthetic. Last week, a nutritionist -- Cherilyn Lee -- said Jackson pleaded for the drug despite being told of its harmful effects, because he had difficulty falling asleep. Sources close to Jackson told CNN that the insomniac singer traveled with an anesthesiologist who would ""take him down"" at night and ""bring him back up"" during a world tour in the mid-'90s. The California state attorney general's office is helping the Los Angeles Police Department in Jackson's death investigation. The office confirmed it is investigating some doctors who treated Jackson over the years. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration is also looking into the role of drugs. Los Angeles police have interviewed Jackson's cardiologist, Dr. Conrad Murray. They impounded Murray's car, saying it might contain evidence, possibly prescription medications. Police did not say whether they found anything. Through his lawyers, Murray has released several statements, saying he would not be commenting until the toxicology results from Jackson's autopsy are released. Dr. Neil Ratner, the anesthesiologist who accompanied Jackson during the HIStory tour in the mid-'90s, also refused to comment, although he acknowledged Jackson suffered from a sleep disorder.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- He's been a homicidal singing barber in ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" and a drunken swashbuckler in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End."" Depp is back as bank robber John Dillinger, revered in the Depression as a modern-day Robin Hood. Now, Hollywood shape-shifter Johnny Depp is back as another unexpectedly charismatic outlaw: Depression-era bank robber John Dillinger, a character he says he's been drawn to since he was a boy. ""I sort of had a fascination with John Dillinger when I was about 10, 11 years old, for some reason,"" Depp told CNN. ""I always kind of admired him, oddly."" Oddly, perhaps, because for a short but intense period between September 1933 and July 1934 Dillinger and his gang rampaged through the American Midwest, staging jail breaks, robbing banks, and killing 10 men and wounding seven along the way. Dillinger's violent spree is the focus of gangster drama ""Public Enemies,"" the latest offering from director Michael Mann, and also starring Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard. Mann is known for his sympathetic portrayal of criminals, and Dillinger -- whose acts on the wrong side of the law led him to become one of America's first celebrities -- is the quintessential good hood. In the 1930s, the United States was in the grips of the worst financial disaster in history -- a time when many Americans watched their life savings disappear and became jobless and hungry. Members of the public blamed banks for losing their money and politicians for failing to stop them. For many, Dillinger's exploits represented sticking it to the fat cats, and he was idolized as a modern-day Robin Hood. J. Edgar Hoover, FBI director at the time, may have made Dillinger America's first Public Enemy No. 1, but the bandit was careful not to alienate the public. There is a memorable moment where he drapes a coat over a female bank hostage during a raid to keep her warm. Also, it's said he never swore in front of women. He was always courteous even as he tried to meet his target of robbing banks in under two minutes. Crucially, he never robbed the average guy, telling him to put his money away during robberies. It is this Dillinger that Depp captures: a captivating revolutionary with the gift of  gab who lit the public's imagination, causing people to flock to cinemas to watch his exploits in weekly newsreels. Review: Depp is great in 'Public Enemies' Of course, the dark, violent side of  Dillinger's psyche is unavoidable. Depp plumbed the depths of his own character to come up with those murkier elements. That was something that took courage, according to Mann: ""He had Dillinger in him; that's something I sensed. Deep in the core of Johnny there's a toughness."" Depp gained recognition throughout the 1990s for immersing himself in characters. He shook off an early reputation as a teen pin-up in movies like Tim Burton's 1991 Gothic tale ""Edward Scissorhands."" He went on to cement his reputation for unusual film choices and quirky performances in films like ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" (2005) and ""Finding Neverland"" (2004).  In pictures: Johnny Depp's iconic roles » . The 46-year-old actor says he felt a close affinity to Dillinger: ""I related to John Dillinger like he was a relative. I felt he was of the same blood. He reminded me of my stepdad and very much of my grandfather. ""He seemed to be one of those guys with absolutely no bull whatsoever, who lived at a time when a man was a man."" ""Public Enemies"" was adapted by Mann from a nonfiction book of the same name by Bryan Burrough. Is it sozzled Captain. Jack Sparrow or smooth Donnie Brasco? Tell us your favorite Johnny Depp character in the SoundOff box below. The ""Last of the Mohicans"" director is known for fastidious research and attention to detail, which in this case included collaborating closely with the FBI to check facts -- although Mann subsequently chose to gloss over some elements for the sake of the story. Mann filmed in many of the locations where Dillinger's story took place almost 80 years ago, including the Biograph Theater on Lincoln Avenue in Chicago, where the bandit was finally shot dead by FBI agents as he came out of a Clark Gable movie. They also shot at Little Bohemia Lodge in Manitowish Waters in the far north of Wisconsin, the site of one of Dillinger's most famous showdowns with the FBI. Dillinger was hiding out there after a botched robbery. When the feds finally caught up with him, two men were killed in the vicious gunfight. ""We were able to shoot not just in the actual place where this happened, but in his actual room,"" says Mann. ""There's a certain kind of magic for Johnny Depp to be lying in the bed that John Dillinger was actually in."" A lot of Dillinger's success was down to superior guns and getaway cars. Depp, who has experience shooting guns from previous productions, had to learn a completely different technique for the heavy guns of the time. Depp says shooting the Thompson submachine gun was one of the highlights of the production: ""When you've got a beast like that strapped to you and you're emptying magazines, a 50-round drum, it's a good feeling."" The ride may have been thrilling for Depp but he also recognizes that the Depression-era setting has some extra significance these tight-belted times. ""You know,"" says Depp, ""We're in the middle of a recession, teetering on a depression. It's time to view the banks and grown-ups for what they are.""","Johnny Depp plays charismatic bank robber John Dillinger in ""Public Enemies""

"(CNN) -- With their nation under high security alert, South Koreans mourned a former leader at a funeral ceremony Friday morning. The hearse carrying Roh Moo-Hyun's coffin heads for Seoul at Roh's hometown village of Bonghwa in Gimhae. Officials and dignitaries gathered in Seoul's Kyungbok Palace to honor former President Roh Moo-Hyun, who committed suicide last week. South Koreans poured into the streets to catch a glimpse of the black Cadillac making a five-and-a-half hour journey from Roh's home in the village of Bongha to the capital. Some bowed their heads or wept openly. Others, still stunned from the loss, stood quietly in black as the hearse drove by. Scores of Roh's supporters handed out yellow balloons, the color associated with Roh's political campaign. Other supporters had posters of Roh's image that read, ""President in my heart"" and ""You are my president."" A person who walked by Roh's memorial site said, ""Roh understood the difficulties of normal people. We feel he acted like a shield for people with no power. He was the people's president."" One woman on her way to work in Seoul said: ""He was the first president South Koreans picked with their own hands."" She was referring to the fact that Roh didn't have a big political machine behind him. He won the election in 2002 by razor thin margin and his appeal was that he related to the common person. This week has been marred by grief and tension for South Koreans as they grappled with Roh's sudden death and renewed threats from North Korea. Following the official ceremony, Roh's body will be taken to the plaza in front of Seoul's city hall, where large crowds are expected to say goodbye to a beloved leader. He will be cremated later Friday and the remains carried back by hearse to Bongha. Roh, who served between 2003 and 2008, jumped from a hill behind his house last Saturday, government officials said. His death came amid an investigation into a bribery scandal that had tarnished his reputation. However, tens of thousands of people have visited memorial shrines for Roh, laying white chrysanthemums in a traditional show of grief and leaving cigarettes on the altars to remember a man who was reported to have taken up smoking during the investigation. In a suicide note given to the media by his lawyer, Roh wrote: ""I am in debt to too many people. Too many people have suffered because of me. And I cannot imagine the suffering they will go through in the future."" Prosecutors were investigating the former president for allegedly receiving $6 million in bribes from a South Korean businessman while in office. Roh's wife was scheduled to be questioned by prosecutors Saturday, and Roh was planning to answer a second round of questions next week.  Why some South Koreans are angry about Roh's death » . The investigation has now been suspended. The debate over Roh's suicide has occupied as much column space in South Korea's press as the recent aggressive behavior shown by the North. On Tuesday, the conservative Chosun Ilbo urged South Koreans to remember the words of the former president's suicide note. ""Roh's abrupt death brings home how vain the rise and fall of power is and how futile it is to nurse hatred and conflict in pursuit of them. Roh himself said in his will, 'Aren't life and death both part of nature? Don't blame anybody.' He would not have wished his own death to cause more political confusion and social conflict,"" the newspaper wrote in an editorial. It also criticized prosecutors who ""seem to have worried about public consensus rather than focusing on principles."" The left-leaning Hankoryeh called Roh's death ""political murder,"" echoing the widespread feeling that the former president paid too high a price for his alleged crime. ""The case of late President Roh was the most unfortunate in South Korean history, brought about by the Lee Myung-bak administration, which despised the person more than the crime,"" the newspaper wrote in an editorial. The mood on South Korea's influential blogs and message boards was somber and split between messages of comfort, dismay at Roh's decision to end his life and angry accusations against prosecutors and the government. ""President Roh's perseverance to provide Korea with a true democracy has come to a sudden end. We saw the grief of his demise in the eyes of millions of Koreans,"" read a message posted on the popular Daum Agora Web portal. ""Prosecutors and the police! Are you the people of the Republic of Korea?,"" asked another. Just before he left the presidency, Roh became the first South Korean leader to cross the demilitarized zone and meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. He believed in the ""sunshine policy"" of his predecessor, Kim Dae-Jung, that sought to engage the north, and Roh also promised aid.

"(CNN) -- The chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court says he has evidence to prove Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir is guilty of genocide, even though he is not charged with the crime. Omar al-Bashir remains president and has traveled to several countries since warrant was issued. Luis Moreno-Ocampo spoke to CNN on Wednesday, two days after he appealed to the court to add genocide to the existing arrest warrant for al-Bashir. The court issued the warrant in March on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity relating to his five-year campaign of violence in western Sudan's Darfur region. ""The evidence shows it is genocide,"" Moreno-Ocampo said. The warrant was the first one ever issued for a sitting head of state by the world's only permanent war crimes tribunal, based at The Hague in the Netherlands. It includes five counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture and rape. It also includes two charges of war crimes for intentionally directing attacks against civilians and for pillaging. Al-Bashir remains president and has traveled to several countries since the warrant was issued, even though any country that is party to the ICC has an obligation to hand him over to The Hague, the court says. The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in Darfur, and 2.5 million have been forced to flee their homes. Sudan denies the death toll is that high. The violence in Darfur erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government. To counter the rebels, Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents there, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations. The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength. In his appeal to the court Monday, Moreno-Ocampo complained that the judges' standard for adding the genocide charge to the warrant is too high. The judges want him to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that al-Bashir committed genocide, but that level of proof is not required for a warrant, which only requires a reasonable inference of guilt, he said. ""They are requesting a level of evidence that is the level of evidence required at the trial stage, not at the beginning of the process,"" Moreno-Ocampo said. Part of the reason that prosecutors cannot provide more evidence at this stage is because al-Bashir is attacking witnesses who are willing to provide information to prosecutors, Moreno-Ocampo said. Presenting more evidence could endanger the victims, he said. ""It's a legal issue,"" he said. ""The judgment by itself is very important, but in addition I cannot accept this wrong legal standard."" The judges believe the crimes that Moreno-Ocampo classifies as genocide instead fall under the category of crimes against humanity, he said. Even if Moreno-Ocampo were successful in adding genocide to the warrant, he would still face a difficult task in proving the charges at trial, said Mark Ellis, the executive director of the International Bar Association. ""Genocide is a much more complicated legal position to meet (than war crimes and crimes against humanity) because you have to show in proving genocide that there was an intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a group based on -- in this case -- ethnicity or race,"" Ellis told CNN. ""Obviously the prosecutor believes he would be able to prove this intent and so he wants the opportunity to prove that in trial."" But if Moreno-Ocampo loses the appeal, Ellis said, it would not minimize the seriousness of the case. ""The charges that have been (alleged) on war crimes and crimes against humanity are still very serious charges and they are egregious acts,"" he said. A ruling on the appeal is likely within six months, Moreno-Ocampo told CNN.","Luis Moreno-Ocampo calls for genocide to be added to al-Bashir's charges .

"(CNN) -- It's been nine years since Kim and Curtis Christiansen were married. Since then they've had their ups and downs, but they've remained close. But when Curtis began snoring about three years ago, Kim began sleeping on the couch. After his snoring drove his wife, Kim, to sleep on the couch, Curtis Christiansen saw a sleep specialist. ""His snoring was so loud. At first I would just elbow him to wake him up,"" she said, ""But then I became concerned. He would just (she gasps for breath). It would take his breath away."" At first Curtis Christiansen figured he was tired, a little run down from his job. He thought the snoring was just a symptom of his exhaustion. But when he started nodding off while waiting at a traffic light, he knew something was wrong. ""I became more aware of this choking and waking-up feeling,"" he said. Kim Christiansen finally persuaded her husband to go to a sleep specialist. The diagnosis: obstructive sleep apnea. According to the National Sleep Foundation, more than 18 million American adults have sleep apnea, and many of them don't know it. Some people think their snoring is just a side effect of a busy lifestyle.  Watch more on the difference between sleep apnea and snoring » . In some cases, that's true. But the foundation says it's trying to get more people to realize how important it is to know the difference between occasional snoring and apnea. Studies have shown that sleep apnea has some serious side effects. A disorder in which breathing is briefly and repeatedly interrupted during sleep, apnea occurs when the muscles in the back of the throat fail to keep the airway open, despite efforts to breathe. That can cause broken sleep patterns and low blood oxygen levels. Doctors say these side effects can lead to hypertension, heart disease, and mood and memory problems. In a recent study at the University of Maryland Medical Center, researchers found that sleep apnea can cause a rise in depression and that sleep-related breathing disorders can also worsen nightmares and post-traumatic stress disorder. And because sufferers are usually sleepy during the day, apnea can increase the risk of automobile crashes. There's no question it can be life-threatening, doctors say. So how do you know whether your snoring is something more serious? When snoring starts to affect your daily habits, you should see a doctor, said Dr. Thomas LoRusso, director of the Northern Virginia Sleep Diagnostic Centers. ""A bed partner may notice that the patient stops breathing and snores loudly, "" LoRusso said. ""And the daytime symptoms are sleepiness, poor concentration, problems waking up in the morning."" LoRusso says a good way to check your sleep habits is to note your levels of fatigue during the day and jot down other symptoms you might be having. And if you have a bed partner, ask whether he or she has noticed any ""choking or gasping while you snore,"" he said. ""The person you sleep with, many times, knows your snoring better than you."" Specific lifestyle changes can help you avoid sleep apnea, the sleep foundation said. LoRusso agrees. ""Cut out the alcohol,"" he said. ""It can make the upper airway muscles to relax."" And watch your weight. Losing pounds can ""cure"" sleep apnea, especially for overweight people, LoRusso said. If you smoke, try to quit, he said. Smoking creates swelling in the upper airway, making apnea worse. These seemingly small changes can have dramatic results. ""In some cases, changing these factors can eliminate sleep apnea from some patients,"" LoRusso said. For Curtis Christiansen, it wasn't that easy. Not only was he thin and a non-smoker, he suffered from high blood pressure and high cholesterol and, because of a previous health issue, had only one kidney. He needed help immediately. His doctor recommended a device called a CPAP, or continuous positive airway pressure device. It's a mask or nose piece that blows air into the airway to keep it open while a patient sleeps. Although surgery is an option for those who have problems even with the CPAP, Christiansen wasn't one of them. Since his diagnosis, Christiansen has gotten his blood pressure under control. When he started wearing the CPAP, he confesses, he'd leave it behind when he went out of town. ""But I found I wasn't getting a good night's sleep, so now I take the CPAP along,"" he said with a smile, ""and I have a restful vacation with my wife.""","In sleep apnea, breathing is briefly and repeatedly interrupted .

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono held a commanding lead in national elections Wednesday, according to the latest exit polls. A woman votes at a polling station in Indonesia. An average of six exit polls showed the incumbent holding about 60 percent of the vote compared to 27 percent for former President Megawati Sukarnoputri and 12 percent for Yudhoyono's vice president, Yusuf Kalla. Official results are expected no sooner than next week. Indonesia has 175 million registered voters spread over 17,000 islands. It was the country's second direct election since the authoritarian regime of dictator Suharto fell in 1998, in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. Analysts and polls, ahead of the vote, predicted Yudhoyono -- riding high on the country's economic strength -- would win a second term.  Watch as incumbent expected to win election » . In 2004, Yudhoyono defeated then-incumbent Megawati in a runoff election.  Watch more on the election » . Yudhoyono ""has positive global image; relations with the American government have been the best in all the time that I have been here, the last 30 years,"" said James Castle, who analyzes Indonesia's politics and economy. ""He's very popular in the foreign community and, to be honest, if he's not re-elected, the markets will react negatively for a month or so."" Yudhoyono's Democratic Party was the only single party to get enough votes in April's legislative elections to nominate a candidate on its own. Kalla's Golkar Party came in second and Megawati's Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, or PDI-P, placed third. Kalla and Megawati had to form coalitions with other parties to run for president.

Yudhoyono is known as ""Mr. Clean"" because of his anti-corruption efforts. He has gained popularity for his handling of the 2004 tsunami recovery and the country's battle against terrorism. Indonesia has had impressive economic growth over the past five years, though how much direct credit Yudhoyono can take for that is questionable. And despite Indonesia posting an average of 5.9 percent annual growth during his presidency, little of that has trickled down to the country's poor. Yudhoyono's opponents say he is too liberal, is too skewed toward the west, and doesn't pay enough attention to the 40 million Indonesians living below the poverty line. Still, the country is exhibiting surprising resilience in the face of the global economic downturn. Growth topped 6 percent last year, and Indonesia was the fastest-growing economy in southeast Asia in the first quarter of this year.

"(CNN) -- The White House unveiled a strategy to combat rising drug crimes along the border Friday, vowing to curb the flow of narcotics and weapons that has been endangering more and more U.S. communities. Pedestrians cross the U.S.-Mexico border at the San Ysidro gate in San Diego, California. ""The National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy we introduce today provides an effective way forward that will crack down on cartels and make our country safer,"" Attorney General Eric Holder vowed in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the plan ""calls for tougher inspections, more enforcement personnel and close coordination with our partners in Mexico as we work across federal, state and local governments. ... Together, we will continue to reduce the flow of illegal drugs across the Southwest border and ensure that those who ignore our laws are prosecuted."" The plan did not appear to contain any surprises. It focuses largely on increased intelligence, cooperation among law enforcement agencies and enhanced technology. A summary released by the White House also promises ""targeted financial sanctions to disable drug trafficking organizations."" Rising drug violence in the United States is one of the administration's top domestic concerns. Among the worst-hit cities in recent years is Phoenix, Arizona, where there's been an average of more than one reported kidnapping every day since 2007, virtually all linked to the drug trade. Home invasions have spiked as well. As drug cartels have extended their reach in the United States, the violence has also been on the rise on the other side of the border. More than 40 people, including two police officers, have been killed in shootings in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez since last weekend, authorities there said. Gil Kerlikowske, President Obama's director of national drug control policy, will oversee the policy announced Friday. ""This new plan, combined with the dedicated efforts of the government of Mexico, creates a unique opportunity to make real headway on the drug threat,"" Kerlikowske said. ""At the same time, we are renewing our commitment to reduce the demand for drugs in the United States, which will support this effort. The National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy will improve the safety of communities on the border and throughout our nation.""

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A longtime employee and vault manager for a jewelry company in Long Island City, New York, stole millions of dollars worth of gold and gold jewelry from her employer over a six-year span, the Queens district attorney has alleged. Teresa Tambunting, 50, of Scarsdale, New York, is accused of stealing as much as $12 million from Jacmel Jewelry, Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said in a statement Wednesday. At an arraignment Wednesday, she did not enter a plea to charges of first-degree grand larceny and first-degree criminal possession of stolen property, the district attorney's office said. She was released on $100,000 bail and will return to court May 19, the office said. Her attorney, David Kirby, did not return phone calls seeking comment. Tambunting, who worked for Jacmel for 28 years, has returned about $7 million worth of gold, but $4 million remains missing, according to Brown. ""The defendant is accused of establishing a virtual mining operation in Long Island City which siphoned off millions of dollars' worth of the precious metal from her employer,"" Brown said. Police say Tambunting -- whose job responsibilities involved monitoring the vault in which fine gold, finished products and raw materials were stored -- confessed that for several months last year, she hid gold in makeshift slits in her purse. An inventory in January revealed that as much as $12 million in merchandise was missing, Brown said in the written statement. After an investigation, Tambunting arrived at the jewelry company's offices wheeling a suitcase containing about 66 pounds of gold, an estimated $868,000, the district attorney's office said. In February, about 450 pounds of gold was taken from her residence, the office said. Tambunting became vault manager in 1991, the office said. The dates of the alleged thefts were not immediately clear. The value of the gold returned fluctuates because of the rise and fall of gold prices. However, the charges are based on what Jacmel claims it lost: $3 to $12 million, according to the Queens district attorney. Jewelry manufacturer owners often find themselves in precarious circumstances when protecting their companies from thievery, said Benjamin Mark, who owned a jewelry manufacturing company in New York for 20 years. ""Unless you have metal detectors where every single employee removes their shoes and belts, you can't be certain,"" said Mark, who now operates a one-man business. ""Stealing jewelry is relatively simple."" Jacmel Jewelry is one of the country's largest manufacturers and distributors of popular price jewelry, according to its Web site. It employs more than 1,000 people worldwide, according to its president, Jack Rahmey. Rahmey said he is cooperating with authorities. Tambunting faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted.","Vault manager worked for Jacmel Jewelry for 28 years .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's dermatologist did not rule out that he may be the biological father of Jackson's children, and Dr. Arnold Klein denied that he ever gave Jackson dangerous drugs. When asked if he were the father of Jackson's oldest children, Klein said ""not to the best of my knowledge."" Klein, in an interview Wednesday on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" denied that he was on the list of doctors being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department. When he saw that someone gave Jackson a dangerous drug, he was the one ""who limited everything, who stopped everything,"" Klein said. Jackson danced around Klein's Beverly Hills office just three days before his death and was ""not in terrible pain,"" Klein said. Debbie Rowe, who was briefly married to Jackson and gave birth to his two oldest children, worked for 23 years in Klein's office, he said. The doctor refused to say whether he thought Rowe should get custody of them instead of Jackson's mother, Katherine Jackson.  Photos: Stars come out for memorial » . ""I can't make those answers, because 'should have' and 'will' are two different things,"" he said. Klein was scheduled to talk to CNN's Larry King about Michael Jackson on Wednesday night.

Katherine Jackson was given temporary guardianship of the children by a judge several days after her son's death. Rowe was considering whether she will seek custody or visitation of the two born to her, her lawyer said last week.

""He could take all the medication I have given him in a year, and nothing would happen to him."" Klein said he has ""sedated him in the past,"" when he ""put him through very painful procedures.

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- After huffing and puffing up 354 steps to the newly reopened Lady Liberty crown, Aaron Weisinger figured it was time to pop the question to his girlfriend, Erica Breder. Aaron Weisinger proposes to Erica Breder on July Fourth inside the crown of the Statue of Liberty. ""The Fourth of July has always been a favorite holiday, so that was part of it, "" Weisinger said. The couple flew to New York from San Francisco, California, after managing to be among the first 240 people to snag the tickets to the Statue of Liberty crown for its reopening after September 11, 2001. Weisinger got down on one knee inside the narrow, 8-foot-long deck inside the Statue of Liberty's crown, asked Breder to be his wife and offered her a sizeable diamond ring. ""I believe I was silent for several minutes. I was so excited,"" Breder said. Then she said ""yes."" Both said their families came to the United States via Ellis Island. ""My great-grandparents immigrated [from Russia and Hungary],"" Weisinger said. His fiance's relatives arrived from Hungary. ""The thoughts behind the statue and freedom and liberty allowed our parents and great-grandparents before us to have the wonderful lives that we do,"" Weisinger added. Breder said she was thrilled to make the long climb up a steep spiral staircase to stand inside Lady Liberty's crown. ""It was fantastic, much smaller than we had anticipated. The view's fantastic,"" the newly engaged Breder said. New safety measures include double handrails, glass stairwell partitions and careful crowd control, according to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. Now, only three groups of 10 visitors per hour are guided up to the crown by a National Park Service ranger. That means only about 87,000 will be able to visit each year. In the past, it took visitors at least an hour and a half to climb from the base to the crown. Now, it takes only about 15 to 20 minutes. A new engineering study showed that there had to be changes to make it easier to exit the crowded staircase. Crown tickets can now be reserved online up to a year in advance, but the statue will close again in two years for additional renovations.","Aaron Weisinger proposed to Erica Breder on July 4 inside the Statue of Liberty .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The first official indication that a family service for Michael Jackson will be held at Forest Lawn Cemetery came from a Los Angeles police official Sunday. A memorial poster for Michael Jackson is displayed outside Staples Center in Los Angeles on Sunday. Forest Lawn officials were working with the Jackson family on their plans, which were part of ""a package"" of events Tuesday, said Jim McDonnell, assistant chief of staff of the Los Angeles Police Department. His comments, however, did not answer questions about where or when Jackson would be buried. While there are five Forest Lawn cemeteries in the Los Angeles area, a long line of media trucks and crews have been parked at the gate of the Hollywood Hills facility for several days in anticipation of Jackson's possible interment there. The family of the singer, who died June 25, has given no public statement on the planning. However, brother Jermaine Jackson told CNN on Thursday that a private service would be held Tuesday morning. A public memorial for Michael Jackson at the Staples Center in Los Angeles is set to start at 10 a.m. PT Tuesday. McDonnell said police do not expect a Jackson motorcade to take place on Tuesday. An official with AEG Live, the concert promoter handling the public memorial plans, said there would be no funeral processional. About 1.6 million fans registered for a chance at fewer than 9,000 pairs of tickets to the memorial service, organizers said. Registration ended at 6 p.m. Saturday. The 8,750 registrants picked in a random drawing were to receive an e-mail Sunday after 11 a.m. PT, AEG Live said. Tickets will be handed to the winning registrants Monday outside the Staples Center, said Tim Leiweke, president of AEG Live. Ticketholders will also have wristbands to match their tickets, a precaution against people ""trying to take advantage"" of the system, he said.","L.A. police: Cemetery officials working with singer's family for private service .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Miami Dolphins defensive end Randy Starks was arrested early Sunday after police said he struck an officer with a slow-moving Freightliner truck, according to a police report. Miami Dolphins defensive end Randy Starks was arrested early Sunday, according to police. Starks, 25, faces a charge of aggravated battery, according to the report. The arrest took place about 12:20 a.m. in Miami's South Beach area. Officers said they saw the Freightliner truck in bumper-to-bumper traffic on South Beach's Ocean Drive with some 13 people inside, including a woman sitting on the lap of Starks, who was driving. The truck's seating capacity is four occupants, the police report said. It was not clear from the police report whether the Freightliner -- normally part of a tractor-trailer -- was connected to a trailer. In the report, the officer recalled pursuing the truck on foot for about a half-block and pounding on the rear driver's-side window, but it kept moving. The officer caught up to the truck again, and it stopped after the officer pounded on the window again, the report said. ""I slowly approached the side door and just as I reached it the vehicle accelerated and started moving forward and slightly to the left,"" the unidentified officer writes in the report. ""The vehicle's path caused the driver's side of the vehicle to strike me in the chest pushing me back and pinning me against a vehicle stopped in traffic in the northbound lane."" Meanwhile, a second officer was pounding on the passenger's-side window, the report said. The truck stopped, and Starks was arrested. A police check showed that the truck's license plate was not assigned to that vehicle, the report said, and Starks faces a charge for that as well. Starks was released from jail later Sunday, according to a records check. The Miami Herald newspaper reported earlier he was jailed on $10,000 bond. Dolphins spokesman Harvey Greene told CNN the club was ""only recently made aware of the situation. Since we are in the process of gathering information we have no comment."" Starks is in his sixth NFL season and his second with the Dolphins.","Miami Dolphins defensive end Randy Starks was arrested early Sunday morning .

"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN/In Session) -- She earned $1 million a year as a high-powered financial executive, yet she told a jury she woke up hungry in a cold house because her husband controlled everything. Sandra Boss testifies about the 12  years she spent with a man she thought was one of the Rockefellers. She said it took years to leave the man who told her he was a member of the moneyed Rockefeller clan because she didn't know the online passwords to their bank accounts. Being the breadwinner offered her no status in her marriage, Sandra Lynn Boss, 42, testified Tuesday at her former husband's kidnapping trial. ""You mistakenly confuse money and power. Money and power are not the same thing in a relationship,"" she explained under cross-examination by her former husband's defense attorney, Jeffrey Denner, who at times seemed stunned by her answers. The lawyer asked Boss why she didn't assert herself given that she was a ""dynamic, intelligent woman"" who financially supported the family. She responded, ""I did assert myself but the abuse was pretty rough. There was a lot of anger and yelling.""  Watch how she felt powerless to leave » . She said she believed the fanciful stories her husband wove around his image as Clark Rockefeller and never saw any sign of mental illness. Denner asked how a successful businesswoman who was educated at Stanford and Harvard universities could fall for an impostor who called himself Clark Rockefeller. ""There's a big difference between intellectual intelligence and emotional intelligence,"" Boss explained. ""I'm not saying I made a very good choice of a husband. It's obvious I had a pretty big blind spot."" Rockefeller, whose real name is Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter, is accused of kidnapping their daughter, Reigh, for six days in July and taking the child to Baltimore, Maryland, where he'd bought a townhouse near the harbor. His trial began last week in Boston, Massachusetts. In her second day on the stand, Boss described the decline of a 12-year marriage that began with a whirlwind summer romance before her second year at Harvard business school. By the time her marriage ended, she said, ""My personal life was scary."" She repeatedly referred to her 48-year-old ex-husband as ""the defendant."" Defense attorney Denner referred to his client as ""Clark"" during questioning. Boss, who now lives in London, England, with Reigh, 8, publicly told her story for the first time on the witness stand. She has been excoriated in the media. One New York writer called her a ""ding-bat doormat"" who married a ""Crockefeller."" It's more complicated than that, Boss explained under cross-examination. ""He told compelling stories. It seems stupid in hindsight, and it really was, but that is how it was. ... I lived with a person who told me a set of internally consistent things."" And so, she never questioned why he never seemed to make any money, possess a driver's license, or bring any family around. She had no doubt he had a billion-dollar art collection, even if she was annoyed he would refuse to sell off a piece or two when money got tight. She was questioned at length about one particularly bizarre story he told. He said a fall down some stairs left him mute as a child -- until he saw a dog and spontaneously uttered ""woofness"" at age 10. She did acknowledge on the stand that she considered ""woofness"" to be a ""stupid word."" And, she said she didn't question him when he told her that asking people to pay him for work he did was beneath the dignity of a Rockefeller. She initiated divorce proceedings after hiring a private investigator in 2006, who determined that her husband definitely was not who he said he was. He agreed to part, surrendering custody of their daughter for $800,000, two cars, her engagement ring and a dress he had given her. On July 27, during an agreed-upon custodial visit, he allegedly abducted Reigh. ""I was completely traumatized,"" Boss said. ""I was hysterical."" Denner questioned Boss at length about his client's mental state during their marriage. She said he told her in 1999 that he thought he was having a nervous breakdown folowing the Asian market collapse. They moved from New York as a result. But, despite the defense attorney's prodding, Boss would not characterize her former husband as delusional. ""The defendant was often very unpleasant -- lack of empathy, anger, control issues, absolutely. I'm  not a psychologist, but he was hard to live with ... I saw behavior that made me think that he wasn't at all well, yes,"" she testified. Again, Denner suggested that her situation did not make sense, pointing out, ""You are a consultant with one of the most prestigious companies."" Boss replied: ""I come from a place where you don't even jaywalk. It never occurred to me that I was living with someone who was lying to me."" She added, ""He was lying to a lot of people."" She was followed to the stand by FBI experts and another former wife. The defense case could begin Wednesday.","Ex-wife says she had trouble leaving Rockefeller impostor .

"(CNN) -- President Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday held their first face-to-face meeting since each took power, confronting a range of potentially divisive issues. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Obama visit at the White House on Monday. At a pivotal moment in the Middle East peace process, the two leaders met at the White House to discuss, among other things, the endorsement of a two-state Palestinian solution and relations with Iran. The issue of Iran's nuclear ambitions became an increasingly urgent one in recent months. Netanyahu wants a time limit for negotiations relating to such ambitions, with the threat of military action if no resolution is reached. Obama is seen as unlikely to provide a timetable. Both Israel and the United States believe Iran is seeking nuclear weapons under the guise of a civilian nuclear energy program; Tehran denies the accusation. Israeli leaders have pointed to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's calls for the end of Israel as a Jewish state and argue that quick action is needed. At an Oval Office news conference, Obama again refused to commit to an ""artificial deadline"" for Iranian negotiations. But he also warned that he would not allow such talks to be used as an excuse for delay while Iran develops a nuclear arsenal. Obama said he expects to accelerate such talks after the June Iranian elections. ""I firmly believe it is in Iran's interest not to develop nuclear weapons, because it would trigger a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and be profoundly destabilizing in all sorts of ways,"" Obama said. It ""is important ... to be mindful of the fact that we're not going to have talks forever. We're not going to create a situation in which the talks become an excuse for inaction while Iran proceeds with developing ... and deploying a nuclear weapon."" He said the United States is not ""foreclosing a range of steps, including much stronger international sanctions, in assuring that Iran understands that we are serious."" Netanyahu emphasized that although ""the common goal is peace ... the common threat we face are terrorist threats and organizations that seek to undermine [that] peace and threaten both our peoples."" The prime minister called Iran the biggest threat to peace in the region. ""If Iran were to acquire nuclear weapons, it could give a nuclear umbrella to terrorists, or worse, could actually give [them] nuclear weapons. And that would put us all in great peril,"" he said. The divide between the two leaders -- Obama is considered to have a more conciliatory approach to the Arab world than Netanyahu -- was dramatically illustrated shortly before their meeting by Israel's decision to begin construction at the West Bank outpost of Maskiyot. A number of families evacuated from Gaza are now being resettled in Maskiyot; several are living in temporary housing. A government spokesman said the construction's start date and the timing of Netanyahu's trip are a coincidence. Obama wants such outposts dismantled, along with an immediate freeze on settlement expansion. Netanyahu wants to allow natural growth in Jewish settlements in the West Bank -- for example, allowing children who grow up in a settlement to build a home alongside that of their parents. Obama also supports the idea of a Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel. Netanyahu has not endorsed the idea, arguing that Israel needs security guarantees and a clear Palestinian partner for peace talks. ""I want to make it clear that we don't want to govern the Palestinians. ... [If] Israel's security conditions are met and there's recognition of Israel's legitimacy -- its permanent legitimacy -- then I think we can envision an arrangement where Palestinians and Israelis live side by side in dignity, security and in peace,"" Netanyahu said. Pressed on the question of a two-state solution, the prime minister said he thinks ""the terminology will take care of itself if we have the substantive understanding."" Netanyahu and his Cabinet were sworn in March 31. A day later, Israel's new hard-line foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, distanced himself from the Annapolis process, the 2007 relaunch of peace talks adopted by his predecessor, Tzipi Livni. The PLO issued a statement after the meeting criticizing Netanyahu for failing to more explicitly endorse a two-state solution. Netanyahu ""missed yet another opportunity to show himself to be a genuine partner for peace,"" chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said. ""Calling for negotiations without a clearly defined end-goal offers only the promise of more process, not progress."" Erakat praised Obama for supporting a freeze on Israeli settlement activity. Despite their differences, Obama and Netanyahu agree on numerous key issues, such as U.S. military and financial support for Israel. Obama highlighted his stance during his presidential campaign. Obama also supports funding for Palestinian entities not controlled by Hamas, which controls Gaza and which the United States labels a terrorist organization. Before making his trip to Washington, Netanyahu met with leaders of Jordan and Egypt, viewed as potential partners in the effort to bring peace to the region. Obama will host Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on May 26 and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on May 28. He is also scheduled to deliver a long-awaited speech on relations between the United States and the Muslim world in Cairo, Egypt, on June 4. Some Palestinian leaders have expressed hope that Netanyahu, under pressure from the new U.S. administration, may soon choose to accept the principle of a two-state solution. ""If, in fact, Mr. Netanyahu were to make an unequivocal statement about acceptance of this as a solution concept, then he should immediately be asked to begin, immediately, to implement Israel's other obligations under the road map,"" said Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian prime minister. The road map, put together by the Mideast Quartet -- composed of the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the United States -- calls on Israel to stop settlement building and Palestinians to stop terrorism. The plan was introduced in 2003 but immediately stalled. Monday's meeting between Obama and Netanyahu was largely expected to be a chance for the two sides to discuss their positions rather than iron out differences. Aides on both sides stressed that each leader views the other as a friend in peace efforts. CNN's Paula Hancocks contributed to this report.","President Obama, Israeli prime minister meet for first time as national leaders .

"(CNN) -- It started with sinus congestion for Shawna Coronado. Then the splitting migraines came. Coronado soon discovered the furry causes: Harrington and Kalamazoo. Shawna Coronado endures headaches and congestion to  keep her 30-pound pug, Harrington. Her 30-pound pug and orange tabby scattered dead skin flakes around the house, triggering Coronado's allergic reactions. Her two daughters are also allergic, but their reactions are less severe. Like the 10 million American pet owners with allergies, the Coronados faced a dilemma: Can human and dog co-exist in the same house? ""We love them,"" said Coronado about her family's pets. ""They're adorable. They're really our babies. They're part of the family. We could never live without them."" Allergies can cause itchy eyes, hives, sneezing, congestion or even asthma. To keep animals around, allergic pet owners get shots, pop antihistamines, squeeze eyedrops, squirt nasal spray, use inhalers or just deal with it. Others try to find a dog that won't trigger the symptoms. President-elect Barack Obama's family has said his family is seeking a ""hypoallergenic dog,"" because of his eldest daughter, Malia's, allergies. Unfortunately, there's no such thing. The belief that certain breeds are hypoallergenic is ""a complete misconception,"" said Dr. Robert Wood, chief of pediatric allergy and immunology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""You can't predict by type or breed, or length of hair."" Pet allergies are not caused by dog hair, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology noted in a recent statement. ""The allergen is produced in saliva, urine, dander-- it's not just hair,"" said Dr. Wanda Phipatanakul, an allergist at Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. ""Even with a hairless dog, there are still allergens."" For their next pet, the Coronados are considering a poodle. Although poodles, bichon frises and Malteses are often touted as hypoallergenic dogs, these breeds all produce allergens. There hasn't been sufficient research to determine whether certain breeds are more allergy-friendly, said Dr. Clifford Bassett, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at The Long Island College Hospital in New York. ""There is not a lot of research in this area,"" he said. ""There are differences between breeds, but we don't have research to definitively say. They all produce allergens."" The key factors are the animal's size and the volume of hair. The fur can collect pollens, mold spore and allergens and bring them indoors, triggering reactions. Even so, reactions vary widely, because everyone's body is different, doctors say. Before committing to a pet, make an arrangement to bring the animal to the home for a trial period to see how the person with allergies fares. ""It's always going to be trial and error,"" Wood said. ""Someone might be allergic to one breed, but the main dog allergen that people are allergic to is present in all dogs."" It is also possible for someone to develop dog allergies months or years after bringing the animal home. If symptoms arise, doctors recommend getting tested to be certain that the allergy is coming from the animal. Allergic reactions could come from other irritants, such as pollen or dust. A person's allergies can also inexplicably change over time. In the same way that some people outgrow food allergies, there is a rare possibility that pet owners could outgrow their allergies to animals, experts said. Pills and medications are available to treat the symptoms, but the best remedy, said Philatanakul, is to not have pets. ""There's nothing that can be done except for avoidance,"" she said. ""There's no cure. You're exposing yourself to high levels of allergens in your home. We generally recommend they should not have a pet. It's not recommended."" For many families, having a loving, furry companion outweighs the runny noses, wheezing and water eyes. Coronado, who is also allergic to mold, dust and yeast, suspects it's not just the dog and cat causing her headaches. After cutting out beer, bread and cheese from her diet, she says she doesn't get as many allergic reactions. But she can't pick up the cat without getting congested. Sometimes Harrington and Kalamazoo trot into the house bringing all sorts of allergens with them and trigger her allergic reactions. Despite the discomforts, the Coronados aren't getting rid of their animals. ""Our lives are so enriched because we have dogs and cats,"" she said. ""You can live in a positive way and live well with the pets or you can suffer every day and think it's miserable. It's really how you look at it. The reason we live with pets is because we live life in a positive way and we work it out."" Her two daughters have cat allergies, but they don't have asthma or breathing difficulties, so Kalamazoo is staying put in their Warrenville, Illinois, home. ""Pets are healing for we humans,"" Coronado said. ""They are for my children. We adore them as part of the family. On a mental health level, children gain something from pets. Children gain a lot from being in nature and being outside. Dogs and cats as pets are part of that experience."" Pets do provide therapeutic value, said Bassett. ""Pets make people feel good,"" he said.  ""Pets reduce anxiety, blood pressure. Pets are here to stay.""","10 million American pet owners have allergies .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The memorial service for singer Michael Jackson cost the city of Los Angeles $1.4 million, the mayor's office said Wednesday. A donation page on the City of Los Angeles' Web site has crashed several times since its launch yesterday. Costs included putting extra police on the streets, trash pickup, sanitation, traffic control and more for the Tuesday event, spokeswoman Sarah Hamilton said. Three thousand police officers -- almost one-third of the Los Angeles police force -- were on hand to ensure the Jackson events proceeded smoothly, Los Angeles Assistant Police Chief Jim McDonnell, said Tuesday. The city, which is $530 million in debt, set up a Web page asking Jackson fans to donate money to help with the expenses. On Tuesday morning, hundreds of donors contributed more than $17,000 through the Web site. But then, the high volume of traffic caused it to crash frequently and for long periods of time, the mayor's office said. The city, therefore, was unable to collect contributions for several hours on Tuesday. The site also crashed for 12 hours, beginning at 8 p.m. Tuesday -- and again, periodically throughout Wednesday morning, the office said. Los Angeles City Attorney Carmen Trutanich does not want taxpayers to pay a penny for the service, his spokesman said Wednesday. ""The city attorney does not want something like this happening again, the city paying [the initial costs] for a private event,"" spokesman John Franklin said. ""That's especially in a cash-strapped city, where people have been furloughed or even lost jobs."" During the Los Angeles Lakers championship parade this year, nearly 2,000 police were called in, at a cost of $2 million. The Lakers and private donors reimbursed the city for most of the expenses. Michael Roth, spokesman for AEG, which owns Staples Center and put on the event, could not be reached for comment.","Costs included extra police, sanitation, traffic control for Tuesday's memorial service .

"(CNN) -- Massachusetts sued the U.S. government on Wednesday, challenging the constitutionality of a federal law that defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman. The state of Massachusetts says the Defense of Marriage Act denies same-sex couples essential rights. ""We're taking this action today because, first, we believe that [the Defense of Marriage Act] directly interferes with Massachusetts' long-standing sovereign authority to define and regulate the marital status of its residents,"" Attorney General Martha Coakley said Wednesday afternoon. ""Massachusetts has a single category of married persons, and we view all married persons equally and identically,"" she said. ""DOMA divides that category into two distinct and unequal classes of marriage."" The lawsuit argues that the act, which became law in 1996, denies same-sex couples essential rights and protections, including federal income tax credits, employment and retirement benefits, health insurance coverage and Social Security payments. ""In enacting DOMA, Congress overstepped its authority, undermined states' efforts to recognize marriages between same-sex couples, and codified an animus towards gay and lesbian people,"" the state wrote in the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in federal court. Massachusetts, the first state to legalize gay marriage, said that about 16,000 same-sex couples have been married there since 2004, when it began issuing marriage licenses. Since that time, the lawsuit said, ""the security and stability of families has been strengthened in important ways throughout the state. "" The state is challenging Section 3 of the law, which defines marriage as ""a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife"" and a spouse as ""a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife."" Before the act, the lawsuit argues, defining marital status was the prerogative of the states. The law ""eviscerated more than 200 years of federal government deference to the states with respect to defining marriage,"" it said. The lawsuit also argues that the law forces Massachusetts to treat same-sex married couples differently from heterosexual married couples, particularly through determining who qualifies for the state's Medicaid program, known as MassHealth, and whether a same-sex spouse of a veteran can be buried in a veteran cemetery. ""But for DOMA, married individuals in same-sex relationships in the commonwealth would receive the same status, obligations, responsibilities, rights, and protections as married individuals in different-sex relationships under local, state, and federal laws,"" the lawsuit said. The defendants named in the lawsuit include the Department of Health and Human Services, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki and the United States itself. Charles Miller, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, said the department will review the case but noted that President Obama supports the legislative repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act. In March, Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders -- the same Boston-based group that successfully argued in 2003 for same-sex marriage rights in Massachusetts -- also sued the federal government over Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act. Besides Massachusetts, three other states recognize same-sex marriages: Connecticut, Maine, and Iowa. Vermont and New Hampshire will join their company when same-sex marriages become legal later this year and early next year.","Lawsuit challenges constitutionality of Defense of Marriage Act .

"(CNN) -- As Michael Jackson fans and the media pour into Los Angeles, California, for what could be the most widely watched memorial of all time, an obvious question remains: Where will he be laid to rest? Bette Davis is among the notables buried at the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn park. Although the Jackson family hasn't made an official statement, all signs seem to point toward Forest Lawn Memorial Parks and Mortuaries, the organization that has buried a vast number of Hollywood's notables. On Monday, sources told CNN that Jackson's relatives will hold a private gathering at the Forest Lawn cemetery in Los Angeles Tuesday morning ahead of a massive public service. The gathering is scheduled for 8 a.m. (11 a.m. ET) -- two hours before a memorial service at the Staples Center arena downtown. Cemetery officials have not commented on the matter. Sunday, Jim McDonnell, assistant chief of staff of the Los Angeles Police Department on Sunday, said Forest Lawn officials were working with the Jackson family on their plans, which were part of ""a package"" of events Tuesday. His comments, however, did not answer questions about where or when Jackson would be buried. There is speculation that the burial will be at Forest Lawn's Glendale location, but the media have been swarming around the Hollywood Hills memorial park, located right off the freeway behind Disney Studios. Tito Jackson's ex-wife, Delores ""Dee Dee"" Jackson, is believed to be buried there. Forest Lawn Memorial is the first stop tourists make in search of the crypts of Hollywood greats. Numerous books and Web sites such as findagrave.com and seeing-stars.com claim to have insider knowledge about celebrity grave locations on the properties, but Forest Lawn is unrelentingly secretive about who, exactly, is entombed in its parks. ""We hold the privacy of our client families in very high regard,"" said Bill Martin, spokesman for the Glendale location, which is considered the ""mother lode"" for celebrity grave hunters. ""There are certain areas and property types that have limited access."" The tombs of Sammy Davis Jr., Humphrey Bogart and Jean Harlow are in locked areas not accessible to the general public, according to findagrave.com. With that kind of commitment to privacy, it's understandable why Jackson, known for being reclusive, might be buried there. Avid grave hunter Lisa Burks, who frequents both the Glendale and Hollywood Hills parks, said she wouldn't be surprised if Jackson were to be buried at either location. Burks was first drawn to Forest Lawn Glendale because of its artwork and statuary, but once she found out that celebrities were ""buried with the regular people,"" she said, she began to grave hunt. ""We leave flowers and take pictures,"" Burks said of her time at famous graves. ""It's the way of remembering someone who made a difference, who cheered me up when I was a kid or entertained me. With Michael Jackson ... if he ends up at a cemetery, I'll definitely go and take flowers. They feel like a member of the family, so you treat them like a member of the family."" Even if you can't find a way to see your favorite celebrity's crypt, Los Angeles residents said that just stepping foot in the park is an experience in itself. ""I know for some people cemeteries can be intimidating or just where you go to mourn. But at Forest Lawn, it isn't sad; it's really a beautiful place,"" said Beth Zeigler, an Echo Park, California, professional who frequents the park's museum. But if you call any of the Forest Lawn Memorial Park and Mortuaries a cemetery, you would be remiss. There are certainly graves behind the Glendale park's majestic wrought-iron gates, but that's where the similarities end. Amid its 300 acres, the park has three churches, replicas of all of Michelangelo's works and a copy of Leonardo da Vinci's ""The Last Supper"" in stained glass. Instead of above-ground tombstones, the park uses flat, engraved markers for grave sites, so from afar all you can see are grassy hills. The memorial park draws over a million visitors each year, including 70,000 who come to get married. Built in 1906 as a traditional cemetery, Forest Lawn was revamped by Dr. Hubert Eaton in 1917. Like Jackson, Eaton was ""an icon [of his] time,"" said Laura Kath, author of ""100 Years in the Life of Forest Lawn."" ""[Eaton] is the man who first envisioned the memorial park concept, that cemeteries should not be filled with tombstones but should celebrate the life of those entombed there and celebrate the living,"" Kath said, ""and people loved the whole concept. Eaton was a visionary."" Burks agrees whole-heartedly with Eaton's vision. ""Cemeteries are for the living,"" Burks said about her visits to celebrity tombs. ""We're remembering them. It sounds crazy, but I dare anyone to do it, and I'd bet it would make them feel good.""","Will Jackson be buried among other stars at a Forest Lawn location?

"(CNN) -- A South Florida teenager accused of killing and mutilating 19 cats excitedly described to police how he dissected cats in class, and where to find cats for experimentation, according to police. Tyler Weinman laughed when police told him they had information he was the cat killer, an arrest document said. When Miami-Dade police told Tyler Hayes Weinman someone was killing cats in the neighborhood, the 18-year-old reacted by laughing, according to a newly released arrest affidavit made public Monday. Most of the cats were found in their owners' yards. ""One appeared to be posed with a slit down the middle of its stomach,"" the affidavit states. On Monday, Weinman pleaded not guilty to more than 40 criminal counts, including multiple charges of felony animal cruelty and burglary. He is out of jail on $249,500 bond and under house arrest wearing an electronic monitor, but is being held for 48 hours for a psychiatric evaluation. The teen's attorney David Macey said there was a ""lynch mob"" after his innocent client and accused Judge Mindy Glazer of ""prejudging"" Weinman. ""He did not kill the cats,"" Macey told reporters outside the courtroom. ""The individual who committed this crime is still running around out there."" The arrest affidavit, which a judge gave prosecutors until Monday to make public, reads like a grisly horror movie and indicates Weinman was knowledgeable of and fascinated with dissection of cats. During questioning, according to the affidavit, a detective told the teenager that police were informed he was involved in the cat slayings. Weinman replied he heard about the cats and that he told his mother. He told police that a school he had been expelled from was the only school in Miami-Dade that taught how to dissect using cats, according to the affidavit. The teenager went on to offer several other bizarre and unsubstantiated trivia, including saying that Mexico is the only source for cats used for dissection and describing their size. Weinman ""became excited and animated"" as he told the detective about cat dissection research he had discovered on the Internet, the affidavit states. ""Weinman was asked to expound on what he meant and he repeated, with noted excitement, 'It just makes a certain sound, a tearing sound,"" says the affidavit. The detective asked Weinman what tools might be used to commit animal cruelty, and teenager replied, ""I don't know, but I'm sure they are very well hidden."" How did he think the cats were being captured? The teen answered, ""They have to be either tranquilized or poisoned."" Weinman came to the attention of authorities in late April, the affidavit states, as cats began to go missing in a suburban Dade County neighborhood called Whispering Pines just outside Miami, Florida. Police had a few times seen Weinman walking and skateboarding in the middle of the night in the area, at least once wearing black clothing and carrying a dark backpack. Detectives stopped the teenager and told him about the dead cats. Weinman responded by laughing, according to the arrest affidavit. He was not held at that time. In May, the teenager was pulled over for a traffic violation and police found a ""cutting instrument"" on the ground beside his car. According to the affidavit, as an officer questioned the teen, he noticed what appeared to be a cat scratch on his arm. ""I got them from a stray cat that I feed at my mom's house,"" Weinman said. The teen ""was eager to show"" the scratches and took off his shirt so that photographs could be taken, according to the questioning detective's account, which is detailed in the affidavit. The teenager's divorced parents lived in separate neighborhoods, according to police. His mother resides in Cutler Bay. His father lives in Palmetto Bay, further north of Miami. According to the arrest affidavit, shortly after the teenager talked to police about dissecting cats, he went to live with his father who restricted his son's access to a car. The killings shifted north as eight dead cats turned up in Palmetto Bay, police said. At that point, police provided the teen's profile to the Miami-Dade Police Department's Psychological Services Section. Staff doctors met and discussed the case. They determined that the cat killer was likely male and suffered from some kind of conduct disorder. If the killer was an adult, they concluded, that person would be classified as a sociopath. In late May, police then got a court order to place a tracking device on the Honda Civic driven by Weinman. The affidavit states the car was tracked to the latest feline victim which had been skinned along the abdomen from the pelvic area to the hind legs. The pelt and genitalia were missing. The cat killings became headline news across the country. Around that time, Weinman joined a Facebook page called ""Catch-The-Cat-Killer."" The teenager is charged with 19 counts of felony animal cruelty, 19 counts of improperly disposing of an animal body and four counts of burglary. He's pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. Kimberly Segal contributed to this report.","Police: Tyler Weinman described research he did on finding cats to dissect .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN)  -- Any attempt to pardon Mikhail Khodorkovsky -- once Russia's richest man, now its most famous inmate -- must follow standard procedure, including an admission of guilt, the nation's president said Sunday. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, is imprisoned in a work camp 4,000 miles from Moscow. ""Concerning the possibility of a pardon for someone, Khodorkovsky or anyone else, the procedure has to be carried out in accordance with our country's rules,"" President Dmitry Medvedev said in a transcript on his Web site. ""In other words, a person must appeal to the president, plead guilty to having committed a crime and seek the appropriate resolution."" The president dismissed talks of a pardon, saying, ""at this point, there is nothing to discuss."" Khodorkovsky once headed the Yukos oil company, once Russia's largest oil producer. He is serving a nine-year sentence for fraud and tax evasion. Medvedev described corruption as a ""very serious Russian disease"" and emphasized the need to fight it. ""To this end, we have enacted a number of measures, including new legislation on corruption and special arrangements relating to government officials, their disclosures, declarations of income and so on,"" he said. ""We are determined to continue this work, because we believe it is extremely important."" The former oil magnate is incarcerated in a work camp near the town of Krasnokamensk, 4,000 miles (6,500 kilometers) from his native Moscow. He has been imprisoned since his arrest in 2003. Khodorkovsky had expressed a desire to run for office at the time and funded opposition political parties. He said the trial was part of a Kremlin campaign to destroy him and take the company he built from privatization deals of the 1990s. The Kremlin denied any role in his downfall. Yukos, which has since been crushed by a $27.5 billion back-tax bill, has been the object of a lengthy campaign by prosecutors and tax authorities. The court also ordered Khodorkovsky and his partner to pay about $600 million in back taxes.","There will be no favoritism for Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russian leader says .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- If a kewpie doll sang in a band and had two kids, she'd be Gwen Stefani. Gwen Stefani was ready to get back with No Doubt after two solo albums and an active home life. The pop star and style icon turns 40 this fall, but she still uses words like ""you know"" and ""like"" at least five times a minute. That's part of Stefani's charm, and her carefree teenybopper mentality is one of the many reasons fans are excited about her first tour with No Doubt in half a decade. It's been 14 years since the quartet busted out of Orange County, California, with its signature sound of sunny, ska-influenced pop. In 2004, No Doubt went on hiatus as Stefani launched the first of two successful solo albums. In the meantime, drummer Adrian Young and guitarist Tom Dumont worked on side projects and watched their families grow. Stefani and her husband -- former Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale -- welcomed two sons, while bassist Tony Kanal is the only member to remain single and child-free. No Doubt is currently in the midst of a 53-date North American tour, for which they've dusted off such classic hits as ""Just a Girl,"" ""Spiderwebs"" and ""Bathwater."" Each member now travels in their own individual tour bus -- a must for an entourage that includes kids, toys and nannies.  Watch No Doubt in concert, at rest » . CNN: You'd hear rumors every once in a while that you guys were breaking up, or had broken up. Were those annoying, or did you kind of roll your eyes and say, ""That's part of the game?"" Adrian Young: I think we expected it. And there might even be some people that will think that we broke up, and that this is a reunion tour -- and it's just not the truth. We went 17 straight years without stopping, and we started having families, and we were burnt and we needed to do our own thing for a while. CNN: What was it like to get all four of you together in a room again? Tom Dumont: It's kind of like an old glove. It just fits. Young: Like an O.J. glove? Dumont: No, no, no. I know it's a weird analogy, but in the sense of -- you know, it fits. Tony Kanal: You know when somebody says ""glove"" now, you immediately think of O.J. Young: ""If it fits, you must acquit."" That's our band motto now. Dumont: We're not going to quit. We're just great old friends. It's almost like we're brothers and sister, and it's great to be having fun together again. Young: I feel more like we're married. CNN: I hear it's a little bit different this time. Instead of sharing a tour bus, you'll each have your own individual buses. Kanal: This will be our first time on separate buses, only out of necessity. Everyone's bringing their family. CNN: Are you just trying to get away from the kids, is that what you're saying, Tony?! Kanal: No, no, no! I would love to be on the bus with them. Gwen Stefani: Tony's going to be making kids on his bus. Kanal: Yeah, maybe my girlfriend and I will be in the process of starting our family. Stefani, Young and CNN (in unison): Really?! Kanal (ignoring everybody's reaction): But by default, I'm putting a studio on my bus. Because I don't have a crib on my bus -- they have cribs on their buses -- I'm putting a studio on my bus so we can keep writing if the inspiration comes, and we feel like doing it. Stefani: We're just putting the studio out there so we can pretend we might go out there and write songs, but we're really just going to have fun. ... We like writing songs, as well [but] I have to tell you, it's a very tortured process. There is nothing more rewarding when you know you've written a hit, and you know this magic happened. CNN: Did you guys really go to group therapy? Kanal: No. ... We had some self-imposed therapy sessions where we were trying to write music, and we were sitting in the room together, and a lot of stuff came out, and you know, it was kind of an emotional venting. We got rid of a lot of stuff. It was good. Stefani: We spent a lot of time together in the last 12 months. Right when I came off tour (from her second solo album, ""The Sweet Escape""), we started to write, and I was pregnant (with her second son, Zuma), and we did a lot of eating, a lot of chatting -- and then we had this magic 15 minutes from 4:45 to 5 o'clock where music would actually come out for a minute. One day, I was like, ""Argh! I'm in this room still! Let's go on tour!"" And everyone was like, ""OK!"" It was very spontaneous, and it's all kind of geared towards getting out there ... and getting inspired, and hopefully coming out of the other side and making an album. CNN: Gwen, when you were off doing the two solo albums, did you feel guilty at all? Because I know you all were trying to get back together for a couple of years. Stefani: I'm one of those people that I have to follow the inspiration when it strikes. ... These guys are just very supportive. We've been together forever -- forever, forever -- since we were kids, and this is just the one time in our lives we've had a break from each other. Everybody did their own thing. And I think all of us doing our own thing makes us even more grateful for each other, and kind of definitely not taking each other for granted -- not that we ever did before. ... But it's even more intense right now. CNN: Things have changed since the last time No Doubt was on the road, and there a lot of people who don't have that disposable income to spend on tickets for concerts. Young: One of the things we did for this tour for some of the venues is we have $10 lawn tickets for people that maybe want to come to the show, but they're strapped -- and we've never done that before as No Doubt, and it feels really good to do that. CNN: I was calling this a reunion. Was that bad? Stefani: We don't really care. We're just so happy that people want to come out and see the show, whatever they want to call it. We're just happy that people still are even talking about it. ... Even if you didn't really like our songs, or you had this kind of idea about us, come see us live, and we'll slap you around. You might have some fun, you know.","No Doubt is back together -- but don't call it a reunion .

"(CNN) -- Former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, a key architect of the U.S. war in Vietnam under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, has died at age 93, according to his family. Robert McNamara took a lead role in managing the U.S. military commitment in Vietnam. McNamara was a member of Kennedy's inner circle during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, when the United States and the Soviet Union stood on the brink of nuclear war. But he became a public lightning rod for his management of the war in Vietnam, overseeing the U.S. military commitment there as it grew from fewer than 1,000 advisers to more than half a million troops. Though the increasingly unpopular conflict was sometimes dubbed ""McNamara's War,"" he later said both administrations were ""terribly wrong"" to have pursued military action beyond 1963. ""External military force cannot reconstruct a failed state, and Vietnam, during much of that period, was a failed state politically,"" he told CNN in a 1996 interview for the ""Cold War"" documentary series. ""We didn't recognize it as such."" A native of San Francisco, McNamara studied economics at the University of California and earned a master's degree in business from Harvard. He was a staff officer in the Army Air Corps during World War II, when he studied the results of American bombing raids on Germany and Japan in search of ways to improve their accuracy and efficiency. After the war, he joined the Ford Motor Company and became its president in November 1960 -- the first person to lead the company from outside its founding family. A month later, the newly elected Kennedy asked him to become secretary of defense, making him one of the ""whiz kids"" who joined the young president's administration. In October 1962, after the discovery of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba, McNamara was one of Kennedy's top advisers in the standoff that followed. The United States imposed a naval ""quarantine"" on Cuba, a Soviet ally, and prepared for possible airstrikes or an invasion. The Soviets withdrew the missiles in exchange for a U.S. guarantee not to invade Cuba, a step that allowed Soviet premier Nikita Kruschev to present the pullback as a success to his own people. In the 2003 documentary ""The Fog of War,"" McNamara told filmmaker Errol Morris that the experience taught American policymakers to ""put ourselves inside their skin and look at us through their eyes."" But he added, ""In the end, we lucked out. It was luck that prevented nuclear war."" McNamara is credited with using the management techniques he mastered as a corporate executive to streamline the Pentagon, computerizing and smoothing out much of the U.S. military's vast purchasing and personnel system. And in Vietnam, he attempted to use those techniques to measure the progress of the war. Metrics such as use of ""body counts"" and scientific solutions such as using the herbicide Agent Orange to defoliate jungles in which communist guerrillas hid became trademarks of the conflict. McNamara made several trips to South Vietnam to study the situation firsthand. He, Johnson and other U.S. officials portrayed the war as a necessary battle in the Cold War, a proxy struggle to prevent communism from taking control of all of Southeast Asia. But while they saw the conflict as another front in the standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union, which backed communist North Vietnam, McNamara acknowledged later that they underestimated Vietnamese nationalism and opposition to the U.S.-backed government in Saigon. ""The conflict within South Vietnam itself had all of the characteristics of a civil war, and we didn't look upon it as largely a civil war, and we weren't measuring our progress as one would have in what was largely a civil war,"" he told CNN. Casualties mounted, as did domestic opposition to the war. In 1965, a Quaker anti-war protester, Norman Morrison, set himself on fire outside McNamara's office window. In 1967, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched on the Pentagon, which was ringed with troops. By November 1967, McNamara told Johnson that there was ""no reasonable way"" to end the war quickly, and that the United States needed to reduce its forces in Vietnam and turn the fighting over to the American-backed government in Saigon. By the end of that month, Johnson announced he was replacing McNamara at the Pentagon and moving him to the World Bank. But by March 1968, Johnson had reached virtually the same conclusion as McNamara. He issued a call for peace talks and announced he would not seek re-election. After leaving the Pentagon in early 1968, McNamara spent 12 years leading the World Bank. He said little publicly about Vietnam until the publication of a 1995 memoir, ""In Retrospect."" ""You don't know what I know about how inflammatory my words can appear,"" he told Morris. ""A lot of people misunderstand the war, misunderstand me. A lot of people think I'm a son of a bitch.""","Robert McNamara was key architect of war in Vietnam under two presidents .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- International troops in Afghanistan endured another deadly attack Tuesday, a day after 10 NATO-led troops were killed in that country. The body of a U.S. soldier killed in Afghanistan arrives in the United States on Monday. A U.S. coalition service member ""died as a result of injuries"" on Tuesday afternoon in a roadside bombing attack on a convoy in western Afghanistan, the U.S. military said. This follows 10 NATO-led deaths on Monday, the highest single-day total in Afghanistan in nearly a year, according to NATO and U.S.-led coalition numbers. Seven Americans, two Canadians and one Briton died in four separate incidents Monday. On August 18, 2008, 10 French soldiers were killed when about 100 insurgents attacked a patrol in Kabul Province, and a British soldier was killed in southern Afghanistan when insurgents attacked a patrol with a roadside bomb. A month before that, 10 American troops were killed in two separate incidents on July 13, 2008. The latest deaths came as U.S. troops cranked up their fight against the Taliban, a push that includes a major Marine-led offensive against the militants in the southern province of Helmand.

"ALSIP, Illinois (CNN) -- Four people face felony charges after authorities discovered that hundreds of graves were dug up and allegedly resold at a historic African-American cemetery near Chicago, Illinois, authorities said Thursday. Dozens of graves at Burr Oak Cemetery were desecrated by workers as part of a financial scheme, authorities say. Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart said the four would resell the plots in Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, excavate the graves, dump the remains and pocket the cash. ""This was not done in a very, very delicate way, folks,"" he told reporters at a news conference Thursday. ""They would excavate a grave and would proceed to dump the remains wherever they found a place to do it in the back of the cemetery. This was not moving graves; this was not replacing graves; this was dumping of them."" In some cases, graves were stacked on top of each other, they ""literally pounded the other one down,"" Dart said. In all about 300 graves may have been dug up in the cemetery, he said. Authorities identified those charged as Carolyn Towns, an office manager for the cemetery; and Keith Nicks, Terrance Nicks and Maurice Daley, all gravediggers. Each has been charged with dismembering a human body, a felony charge for which sentences range from 6 to 30 years, Anita Alvarez, Cook County state's attorney, said at the news conference. Steven Watkins, an attorney for Towns, said his client is innocent. ""Somebody is apparently making false accusations against my client,"" he said. ""She's maintaining her innocence."" The Cook County state attorney's office said the other three charged were being represented by the public defender's office, and a message left at that office was not immediately returned. Bail was set at $250,000 for Towns and $200,000 for the other three, Alvarez said. None had posted bail by late afternoon Thursday, the sheriff's department said.  Watch officials announce the charges » . It was not immediately known if the four had legal counsel. Authorities began investigating the cemetery -- where, among others, lynching victim Emmett Till, blues legend Dinah Washington and some Negro League baseball players are buried -- about six weeks ago after receiving a call from its owners who had concerns about possible ""financial irregularities"" regarding the business, Dart told CNN earlier this week. ""This crime, it's a whole new dimension,"" Alvarez said. Authorities also suspect that Towns pretended to set up a memorial fund for Till and pocketed the funds, Dart said.  Watch sheriff discuss gruesome revelation » . He told CNN that groundskeepers, who have not been implicated in the scheme, have said that the grave of Till -- whose 1955 lynching at age 14 helped spark the civil rights movement -- has not been disturbed. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was also at the news conference, noted the high-profile names of some of those buried in the cemetery, but said, ""everybody here is special, and every family has special needs and special hurt, special grief."" Most of the excavations occurred in back lots, where the plots were older and not frequently visited, Dart said earlier this week. However, other plots may have been disturbed, as well. The cemetery's current owners, who could not be reached by CNN for comment, have operated it for more than five years but are not believed to be involved in the alleged scam, Dart said. He said the workers may have doctored records to cover their tracks and noted that the cemetery holds all the records of who is buried and where. ""There's virtually no regulations whatsoever (for cemeteries),"" Dart said. ""Most all of the documents and everything are housed here."" Investigators are trying to determine the scope of the alleged scheme and plan to use thermal-imaging devices to further examine other graves to see if they have been tampered with, Dart said. The FBI, forensic scientists and local funeral directors have been called in to help in the investigation, he said. ""I don't even know what to tell you about the heartbreaking stories that I've been hearing from people, crying hysterically that they're going through the burial for the second time today,"" he said. ""And they're looking for answers and we're sitting there telling them, 'This is going to be very difficult,"" he said. ""We're trying to bring closure, but it's going to take a long time to do that.""

"(CNN) -- Three attacks were made on Royal Dutch Shell oil facilities in Nigeria on Sunday, according to a company spokesman who said details were not immediately available. Investigating the attacks will be difficult because they happened in remote areas, Royal Dutch Shell says. The attacks were against pipelines in the eastern part of the Niger Delta in Nigeria, said the spokesman, Rainer Winzenried. ""Shell is investigating the impact on facilities, the environment and the production capabilities,"" he said. The attacks happened in remote areas, making investigations difficult, he said, adding that the company would not send in investigators until it was certain the area was secure. It was not known whether there were any casualties, he said. The pipelines are part of a Shell joint venture that provides oil to several companies, Winzenried said. Shell runs the venture, and Nigeria is the operator. Winzenried refused to speculate on who was behind the attacks, but Nigeria's main militant group -- the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, or MEND -- said it had attacked an offshore facility earlier Sunday and that ""the structure is ... engulfed in fire."" Winzenried had no information about that claim. MEND, which demands a fairer distribution of Nigeria's oil wealth, claimed Friday that it destroyed a pipeline owned and operated by the Italian gas company Agip, but Agip has not confirmed that report. Earlier in the week, MEND claimed to have destroyed Royal Dutch Shell's main trunk line in Bayelsa state and a Chevron oil station in the delta region. Shell confirmed an attack on that pipeline and said it had shut it down to avoid an environmental impact. Chevron, which halted its onshore operations in the region last month, said it was investigating. Last month, the militant group declared an ""all-out war"" on the government after what it said was a deadly bombing raid on civilians. It is not the first declaration of war by MEND, which demands that more of Nigeria's oil wealth be invested in the region instead of enriching those whom the militants consider corrupt politicians. The militant group declared war against the government in September for what it said were unprovoked attacks. At that time, MEND destroyed several oil facilities, forcing Nigeria to cut its oil exports by as many as 1 million barrels of oil per day, or 40 percent.","Royal Dutch Shell: Pipelines attacked in eastern part of Nigeria's Niger Delta .

"(CNN) -- The singer Gil Scott Heron once declared that ""the revolution will not be televised."" Em Hall, the ""D.C. Goodwill Fashionista,"" transformed Goodwill's  image with a witty blog. It is, however, going online. Social activism is being transformed by the Web. Some of the most creative forms of protest and philanthropy are taking place online. Activists are conducting demonstrations on YouTube, holding virtual fundraisers and using social network sites like Facebook to change the world -- one mouse-click at a time. These cyber-pioneers include a nonprofit group that uses animated 3-D characters to protest the global shortage of drinking water; a Web company that allows ordinary people to create their own personalized charity; and a Goodwill blogger who reshaped the thrift store's image so thoroughly she was invited to New York Fashion Week. Ted Hart, co-author of ""People to People Fundraising: Social Networking and Web 2.0 for Charities,"" says the Web has already become a crucial source for nonprofit fundraising. Americans donated $550 million online in 2001, but that number grew to $10.4 billion in 2007, he says. ""It's a new world for a lot of nonprofit organizations,"" Hart says. ""No longer is it good enough to say give us some money. The rules have changed."" Yet some people warn that this new world offers people an excuse to engage in ""drive-by activism,"" superficial forms of cyber-activism that require little commitment. ""The Internet makes it very easy for people to jump in and out of social activism,"" says Matthew Hale, assistant professor at Seton Hall University's Center for Public Service. ""If all the activism is online, it is easier to quit than going to meetings every week."" Real change: online or in-person? Yet the Web makes it easier for a nonprofit group to reach more people than a meeting ever could, one nonprofit group says. WaterPartners International is a U.S.-based nonprofit group that created a global campaign to create safe drinking water. Another company may have flown a spokesperson to an impoverished village and hired a film crew to promote their campaign. But WaterPartners says it saved money and time by putting its campaign online -- through animated, virtual characters built from actual people, says Nicole Wickenhauser, a company spokesperson. Daily Web traffic doubled to WaterPartners' Web site during the campaign and the campaign attracted support from around the globe, Wickenhauser says. ""Real change is most often accomplished by committed individuals working together for a cause they feel passionately about,"" Wickenhauser says. ""Whether they work together virtually or in person is less important."" Web-based activism not only enlarges the reach of social activists, it empowers ordinary people, its advocates say. In another time, a person had to find a charity to give their time and money to. Now they can create their own charity through Web sites like ""YourCause.com."" YourCause.com has been described as a MySpace for do-gooders. The new site allows a person to do everything a charity traditionally does -- raise money and awareness and recruit support -- all from a Web page designed especially for their needs. Matthew Combs, the site's co-founder, says his site designs Web pages and vets charities for people who don't have the time or expertise to do it themselves. ""It's for people like the 73-year-old woman from New Jersey who created her own page to help out with a rare genetic defect she's suffering from,"" Combs says. ""There's not a lot of 73-year-olds on MySpace. How do we make it easy as possible for them, but credible?"" Social network sites like MySpace are also throwing their support behind Web activists. MySpace has an ""Impact"" page that connects users with political and charitable causes. YouTube recently launched a ""Nonprofits and Activism"" channel. 'The reaction was priceless' One of the most audacious forms of Web-based activism comes courtesy of Em Hall, also known by her blog name, the DC Goodwill Fashionista. When Goodwill of Greater Washington wanted to expand its customer base, its leaders devised a campaign to reach out to a younger, hipper crowd. The campaign's centerpiece was Hall. In her witty blog, She dispensed fashion advice, conducted an online virtual fashion show and sold Goodwill clothing on eBay (she once sold an $11.98 suit for $175 on eBay.) Hall's blog averages 1,500 readers a week and has attracted readers from at least 100 countries, says Brendan Hurley, a Goodwill spokesman. Hall's blog became so popular she was invited in September to Fashion Week, a high-octane fashion show that features the world's most popular designers. Hall still recalls how Fashion Week officials acted when she told them what clothing label -- Goodwill -- she represented. ""The reaction was priceless,"" she says. ""A look of confusion came across people's faces as they desperately tried to figure out why Goodwill was at Fashion Week."" Despite the possibilities created by the Web, calling people to action still depends on people putting their bodies -- not just their mouse-clicks -- on the line, says Hale, the Seton Hall professor. ""All of the stuff you can do online ultimately has to show up in the real world,"" Hale says. ""I don't see the Internet as a substitute [for social activism] but as a complement to it."" Paul Loeb, author of ""The Soul of a Citizen,'' a book that examines the psychology of social activism, also says online activism can be powerful but limited. He tells a story from his book to make his point. He says a friend took her kids to a protest against nuclear testing in front of the White House during the early 1960s. But she became dejected because only a few people joined her demonstration and then it rained. Years later, the same woman attended a major march against nuclear testing. Benjamin Spock, the best-selling author and pediatrician who opposed the Vietnam War, was a featured speaker. He told marchers that he was inspired to join the march after seeing a small group of women huddled with their kids in the rain while marching in front of the White House years earlier. ""I thought that if those women were out there,"" Spock said, ""their cause must be really important."" ""He's seeing these ragged women in the rain and it touches his heart and he ends up getting changed by that,"" Loeb says. ""That story couldn't exist in the virtual world.""","The Web unleashes new wave of cyber-activism .

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- Donating to charity itself is a relatively new phenomenon in a society that traditionally values family units. President Lee Myung-Bak is criticized by opposition parties who say he supports policies that favor the rich. So the announcement that South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak will be donating $26 million, the bulk of his wealth, to charity, is considered highly unusual. The president's office said the money will be used to set up a new youth scholarship program. ""My fortune, which I accumulated through hard work during my life, is very precious to me,"" said Lee in a statement. ""I have long thought that it would be good if my wealth was spent for society in a valuable way."" Lee, who came to office last February, promised to donate his personal wealth to society in late 2007 when he was accused of amassing his fortune through illegal means. He was since been cleared of all charges. But he is now facing criticism from opposition parties who say he supports policies that favor the rich. Lee is a former CEO of Hyundai Construction and the Seoul mayor. But he emphasizes his impoverished beginnings, as a poor young man who had to earn his college tuition cleaning streets. ""Looking back, I realize that all of those who helped me were poor,"" said Lee in the statement. ""I know that the best way for me to pay back such kindness is to give back to society what I earned."" Analysts say this move will hopefully encourage many others to follow.","President Lee Myung-Bak to donate $26 million, the bulk of his wealth, to charity .

"L'AQUILA, Italy (CNN) -- Leaders of both industrialized powers and emerging economies have agreed to work together on setting a goal to limit global warming to levels recommended by scientists, U.S. President Barack Obama said at the G-8 summit. G-8 leaders wait for an aide to remove toe markers as they pose for a family photo in L'Aquila, Italy, on July 8. The G-8 countries -- comprising the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and Russia -- agreed to a target of reducing their carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent by the year 2050 to try to prevent the Earth's atmosphere from warming by more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), Obama said. Thursday's meeting with emerging economies including China also secured a commitment from the developing countries to work for limiting global warming to the 2 degree Celsius threshold, Obama said. ""Developing countries among us will promptly undertake actions whose projected effects on emissions represent a meaningful deviation from business as usual in the midterm, in the context of sustainable development, supported by financing, technology, and capacity-building,"" said the declaration from Thursday's Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate. The declaration stopped short of setting targets for the developing nations. Obama said the emerging economies agreed to work toward setting specific targets.  Watch report from CNN's Ed Henry » . He called the commitment of the emerging economies ""an important stride forward"" in minimizing climate change, but acknowledged that the issue he called one of the most challenging of our times would be difficult to confront. Environment groups gave the announcement a cautious welcome. Joanne Green, head of policy at Cafod, told the Press Association: ""Agreeing that average global temperatures should not rise by more than two degrees is forward movement but it is woefully inadequate compared to what was needed."" And Oxfam spokesman Antonio Hill said: ""Today 17 countries, responsible for more than 80 percent of the world's emissions, agreed for the first time that it'd be nice to take the road which stops the planet heating up by more than 2 degrees. ""While G-8 countries continue to speed in the opposite direction, towards a cooked planet and climate catastrophe, poor people want to know whether rich coutries will now actually turn around before it's too late."" The vast majority of climate change scientists warn that warming above the 2 degree Celsius threshold would mean potentially catastrophic impacts on Earth. U.N.-led negotiations on a new global climate change treaty are aiming to conclude with an agreement among 192 nations in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December. Obama said the G-8 targets and work with developing countries are intended to support the international climate change treaty that will succeed the Kyoto Protocol in 2012. In the United States, Congress is debating a new energy policy that could codify the G-8 target for emissions reductions in law. A House bill that recently passed has the same target of an 80 percent reduction by 2050, but Senate passage of a measure remains uncertain.  Watch as leaders tour quake zone » . Republican opponents contend the United States would put itself at a competitive disadvantage by setting firm targets when China and other emerging economies would be free to pollute without limits. Some Democratic senators also fear harmful effects on fossil fuel industries in their states. The Major Economies Forum led by Obama included the G-8 countries along with Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Australia, South Africa and others. The Forum nations account for 80 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Its declaration Thursday outlined a range of actions including funding mechanisms for both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping nations and ecosystems adapt to global warming, along with more money to pursue alternative energy sources. The declaration said the world's emissions should peak as soon as possible and then start going down. It acknowledged that industrial powers have emitted most of the pollution causing climate change and therefore have a greater responsibility in responding. Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced the creation of an institute to study and advance so-called clean coal technology intended to reduce the harmful pollution from coal-fired energy. In addition, the declaration recognized ""that the timeframe for peaking will be longer in developing countries, bearing in mind that social and economic development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities in developing countries and that low-carbon development is indispensable to sustainable development.""  Watch what's on agenda at G-8 summit » . Todd Stern, Obama's special envoy for climate change, noted that China and other emerging economies had never previously acknowledged the 2-degree Celsius threshold or committed to reducing emissions from current levels. He called those steps ""significant,"" but conceded they fell short of binding commitments to meet specific reductions goals. However, Stern said the 2-degree threshold was the ""underpinning"" of the global goal for an overall 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, including the 80 percent cuts targeted by the G-8 countries. Obama acknowledged the United States has previously failed to meet its responsibilities regarding climate change, and he pledged a renewed commitment and leadership. In his remarks, Rudd made a point of welcoming the new leadership role by Obama and the United States. Obama will meet Friday with Pope Benedict XVI, who launched a verbal assault on global capitalism ahead of the G-8 meeting, lambasting ""grave deviations and failures"" and calling for a ""profoundly new way of understanding business enterprise."" The pope challenged bankers to turn away from the practices blamed for bringing about the global economic crisis and instead use their power to help the world create wealth and economic development. ""Above all, the intention to do good must not be considered incompatible with the effective capacity to produce goods,"" Benedict said Wednesday. After his meeting with the pope, the first U.S. African-American president will make his first trip as chief executive to Africa, traveling to Accra, Ghana. Obama's father was a native of Kenya.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A birthday ""cake"" made of ice, beets, apples and pears? It might not sound appetizing, but it was a special treat Thursday for Tai Shan, the Smithsonian National Zoo's giant panda. Giant panda Tai Shan digs into his special birthday cake of ice, beets, apples and pears. A huge group of fans watched as the popular panda celebrated his fourth birthday with the three-tier cake. They cheered him on as he inched closer to the treat, and one woman yelled ""Atta boy Tai Shan!"" when he finally started eating the apple pieces on the cake's lowest tier. She cheered the panda on for eating his ""cake"" the same way a mom might cheer on her son at a soccer game or dad might cheer his daughter playing basketball. Zoo curator Lisa Stevens said people react that way because of how pandas resemble children. ""They share many features of infants and toddlers. They have high foreheads, big eye spots, and they can sit up straight and grip and eat their food,"" Stevens said. Pandas are also known to give hope to the downtrodden, according to one loyal Tai Shan fan who called herself ""Sandy."" During her battle against a medical condition that caused her to be unable to walk, she said that frequent visits to the zoo to see Tai Shan gave her the strength she needed to persevere through the pain. ""I could barely stand an hour to see him, now I could stand all day to watch him. I pushed myself for him ... he's done so much for me and for people all over the world,"" she said. Tai Shan was born at the zoo and has had his entire life documented on a Web cam for the whole world to see. Fans may have little time left to enjoy Tai Shan, as the zoo's contract with the China Wildlife Conservation Association to keep him is set to expire later this year. The zoo is negotiating with the conservation association to keep Tai Shan a few months longer.","Tai Shan was born at the Smithsonian National Zoo .

"(CNN) -- Police in Allendale, South Carolina, are investigating whether a funeral home fit a 6-foot, 5-inch man into his coffin by severing his legs. The wife of James Hines reportedly said the funeral home told her that her husband's coffin was long enough. A former Cave Funeral Services employee has alleged since James Hines' death from skin cancer in 2004 that Hines was too tall for his coffin and that the funeral home took extreme measures to make him fit, Allendale County Coroner Hayzen Black told CNN. Officials exhumed Hines' body Tuesday, Black said, and a fair amount of ""undesirable evidence"" was found, although he could not comment further. The coroner's office handed the case over to law enforcement officials for a criminal investigation, he said. Allendale Police Detective Donnie Hutto told CNN affiliate WJBF-TV that he could not comment on the condition of the body. A Cave Funeral Services employee had no comment when asked about the matter. But Ruth Hines, widow of the dead man, told WJBF that the allegations and exhumation of Hines' body are difficult for her. ""I'm just going through quite a bit,"" she said. ""It's like starting all over again, and it's left me with hurt and numbness."" ""According to the measurements on the casket, and the funeral director, we asked him, 'Was this suitable for his length?' and he said, 'Yes that will be perfect,'"" Ruth Hines said. Hines told WJBF that her family has used Cave Funeral Services for a number of years, and she isn't sure what the family will do in the future if the allegations are true.","At 6'5'', former employee says James Hines was too tall for coffin after death in 2004 .

"(CNN) -- They may live on separate continents, in different countries with differing cultures, but the same message is being echoed by the world's poor, according to a new report by aid agency Oxfam. Farmers in Uganda have little choice but to attempt to cultivate crops on arid land. The report, ""Suffering the Science,"" tells the stories of people who are discovering to their detriment that long-held truths about seasons and rainfall no longer apply. ""I travel a lot and people are always saying to me, 'the seasons have changed,'""Oxfam chief executive Barbara Stocking told CNN. ""I think there's a real sense of uncertainty. People have lost confidence. They have a very close relationship with the Earth, nature and climate and suddenly they're finding that it doesn't work anymore."" People such as Florence Madamu from western Uganda. ""The sun is prolonged until the end of September,"" she told Oxfam. ""And whenever it rains it rains so heavily it destroys all our crops in the fields. You can plant a whole acre or two and come out with nothing."" July is a particularly harsh month in large swathes of Africa. It's the peak hunger season and this year people are expected to be more vulnerable than usual following record high food prices in 2008. Laborers are planting precious seeds in fields of dirt with no guarantee they'll produce a harvest, while the conditions they're working under are becoming more extreme. ""For me the big worry is that many of them don't know why it's happening so they can't actually help themselves prepare for the changes,"" Stocking told CNN. ""We need to work with them to help them become more resilient -- whether it's cyclones and weather-related disasters or whether it's a long-term change. They need to be prepared for very different sorts of seasons now."" And for unfamiliar diseases. Higher temperatures are encouraging the migration of malaria and other vector-borne diseases into new areas where, in some cases, health authorities are ill-equipped to cope. Oxfam found Iha at her daughter's bedside in a hospital in Indonesia. Twelve-year-old Laila was the second of her children to contract dengue fever at their home on the island of Java. ""They said that this is a new type of dengue fever,"" Iha told Oxfam. ""She has already had 30 bags of infusion water. After nine days her condition is still not stable."" It is the stories of people such as Iha who are living with the consequences of climate change that Oxfam hopes will prompt action from leaders of developed nations who are meeting in L'Aquila, Italy this week. ""Ideally what we'd like is the G8 countries to come out very clearly as to what their targets are for carbon emissions reductions by 2020 and the amounts of money needed,"" Stocking said. ""It's unlikely they'll be as precise about that,"" she conceded, adding, ""but we really need some good strong wording in the G8 communiqué about the recognition that for a deal to be done [in Copenhagen], money will be needed for the poorest countries."" Talks in Copenhagen in December are being billed as an unmissable opportunity for developed and developing nations to agree a global plan to combat climate change. Stocking commended a proposal by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown to establish a $100 billion annual fund to help developing nations contend with climate change, but said closer to $150 billion was needed. Oxfam points out that's about the same amount the U.S. government spent on bailing out insurance company AIG. While scientists warn that a cut of 40 percent in carbon emissions by 2020 is vital to avoid severe repercussions, developed nations have yet to commit to anything close. ""We need America to come forward much more positively,"" Stocking said. ""It's really got to stand up to the bar clearly if there's going to be any deal."" ""We're really pressing as well for the EU to come out much more clearly about what it will do it as a whole. ""There isn't even a Council of Minister's meeting until October and that's going to be far too late. There needs to be some serious meetings including heads of state very quickly now to get an agreement to put something very direct on the table,"" she said.","Oxfam report tells the stories of people affected by climate change .

"(CNN) -- Generations of standup comedians never saw this coming. John Heffron is one of an increasing number of comedians joining Twitter. To succeed in the industry these days, you don't just need to be good on stage and screen. You also have to nail the art of sending out mini-messages to Twitter ""followers."" But if your humor is based on storytelling, persona and, you know, the way you say stuff, how can you get hilarious in 140 characters or less? For the pros, it's a challenge and an opportunity. CNN's Josh Levs spoke with two successful standup comics who are diving into the Twitterverse. John Heffron is a winner of ""Last Comic Standing."" Craig Shoemaker won the award for funniest comedy routine on XM Satellite Radio.  Watch Heffron and Shoemaker mix it up » . And we want to hear from you. Send the funniest tweets you've ever seen to Levs via Twitter (@joshlevscnn) or post them on Facebook. The following is an edited version of the interview. Craig Shoemaker: I'm on the information super-cul-de-sac. I mean, I'm not so great at this; I'm learning. And I have no friends. I had more friends at my house yesterday for dinner than I have on Twitter. And (Heffron) is the king. CNN: How did you build up your fan base, John? How did you build up this number of followers on Twitter? John Heffron: I try to be funny; I try to be entertaining; I try to do stuff that hopefully gets re-twitted. Is that the word? Sure. CNN: All right, let's take a look at some of your popular tweets here. You have a section called the original last tweets. And you have one here: ""Guy who always gets killed on Star Trek. Last tweet: 'Got my uniform. The rest of the landing party wearing a different color. Weird!' "" And then my favorite one: ""Married man's last tweet: 'About to go into the champagne room, wish me luck.' "" Heffron: Those are the things that end up, people start passing around and then that's what gets people to go, ""Who is this guy?"" CNN: And Craig, is this what you're chasing? The same idea, those one-liners that get tossed out? Shoemaker: Yeah, I'm a storyteller, so it's not so great for me. I'm still working on this under-140 characters thing. CNN: I did pull out one of yours that I liked too. You wrote, ""Up late in my Pittsburgh hotel, just read a USA today article about how Twitter is no good for intimacy. No worries. I'm alone."" Shoemaker: I don't know if anybody's laughing at the jokes. I tweeted that last night. We'll see how that goes. CNN: Is that part of what's hard about Twitter? When you're doing this, you don't have that kind of instant feedback. You know, if you're doing standup somewhere, you've got the laughter. How do you know? It's like doing this in an echo chamber. Shoemaker: It's the replies. To me, I judge by the replies. Heffron: I've had zero replies. So apparently, I got to work on my tweeting. The whole thing is, when you write, though, it's different. It doesn't have the nuance or things like that. Like I put something about my ex-wife that I got divorced and ""tonight's show is a benefit show and all proceeds go to my ex-wife."" And people are writing back, ""Oh, I feel so sorry for you,"" and I go, ""No, it's a joke."" Shoemaker: Yeah. Criss Angel was on my flight, so I tweeted ""Criss Angel is on our flight. We will not have to use fuel. He will use his superpowers to get us home."" And the replies were, I spelled Criss Angel's name wrong. It's like, come on, people! How am I supposed? You know, that's not the point! CNN: The previous generations never had this problem. No one's never, until really the last few years, no one's ever dealt with the opportunities and the challenges that you guys have. Is Twitter the new standup? Shoemaker: You know, as a comedian, it's funny now it seems like you have to be funny and be this crazy Internet marketer. How can I let somebody know that I'm coming into whatever city, and Twitter and Facebook and all those things are the best way to do it.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The way professional golf is played may have changed for good after the U.S. PGA Tour decided to go along with a new rule that amounts to a rollback of golf technology, a move that world number one Tiger Woods has endorsed. Tiger Woods supports a rule change that will make it harder to play out of the rough. The rule, implemented by the U.S. Golf Association (USGA) and Royal and Ancient Golf Club (RA), means that from the start of 2010 the U-shaped grooves on wedges will be banned in favor of V-shaped grooves, with the intention of rewarding accurate driving over distance hitting. Research by the USGA has shown that U-shaped grooves allow top players to generate much more spin when playing the ball out of the rough, making the ball come to a quick stop on the green. The USGA and RA felt this meant that landing in the rough was no longer enough of a penalty for shots that strayed from the fairway. In recent years pro golfers have begun to drive for distance rather than accuracy, knowing they can spin their way out of the rough if they miss their target -- a style of play known as ""bomb and gouge."" Despite pressure from some players and golf equipment manufacturers, the U.S. PGA Tour has decided to go along with the rule change, meaning U.S. PGA Tour competitions, including the U.S. Open, will feature the club restriction from next year. Amateur competitions will not ditch the U-shaped grooves until 2014 and the new rule will not apply to recreational players until 2024. Gareth Taylor, Product Manager at leading golf club manufacturer Callaway, told CNN he believes the change will reward more skilful players. ""At the moment players are getting a lot of spin on the ball so I think it will make people play better,"" he said. ""They'll have to get their technique finely tuned and not rely on the club."" He says club makers have been given ample notice to prepare for the switch. ""I don't think the change is a regression, it just means research and development will have to come up with better ideas to help the players out."" Taylor explained that as a golfer strikes the ball the grooves on the club face catch the coating on the ball's surface, producing back spin. He said that the rule change applies to five irons and up and requires the grooves on the club face to be more spaced out, which will make it harder for the grooves to catch the ball. Tiger Woods has supported the changes, saying: ""I think it's great. We've had plenty of time to make our adjustments. All the companies have been testing and getting ready for this."" To compensate for the loss of spin from the rough, tour players may use softer balls, which spin more but do not travel as far. That could favor players who already use the softer ball -- including Tiger Woods.","The PGA Tour has agreed to a rule that will ban U-groove clubs for tour players .

"(CNN) -- A 4-year-old Ohio girl who vanished more than three weeks ago was found alive and in good condition, halfway across the country in Southern California, authorities said. Haylee Donathan was found with her mother and her mother's boyfriend, fugitive sex offender Robbi Potter. Haylee Donathan, her mother, Candace Watson, and Robbi Potter were discovered after hiding for the past week at The Morning Star Ranch, a retreat in Valley Center, near San Diego, said Peter Elliott, United States Marshal for the Northern District of Ohio. Potter is a registered sex offender, officials said. He was being sought by the U.S. Marshal's Service. Late Tuesday, Haylee was in the custody of a children's protective services agency in the San Diego County area, Elliott said. She was doing well but may have chicken pox, he added. ""We understand she is healthy and happy and I believe, waiting to come back to her grandmother here,"" he said.  Watch authorities announce their find » . The journey west took them more than 2,000 miles from Mansfield, the north-Central Ohio city where the girl and her mother live. ""I am very happy that my granddaughter's coming home,"" said Mary Watson, Haylee's grandmother. ""And I just want to thank all of you from the bottom of my heart."" Watson, 24, and Potter, 27, were arrested without incident and held by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. When asked their reaction, Elliott said, ""I believe a little shocked that we were able to find them."" Potter and Watson were still using the same vehicle, a 1980s blue Chevrolet pickup truck they drove from Ohio, Elliott said. Watson's hair was a bit darker and Potter also changed his appearance slightly. Authorities had feared Haylee was endangered. Potter, a sex offender, had escaped a halfway house on May 28, the day the girl and her mother fell out of sight. Countless tips came in while they were missing but one in particular led to the breakthrough on Tuesday, Elliott said without elaborating. But a tip from members of the ranch could have led to the raid and arrest, a ranch member told CNN. Kevin Carlin, a member of the ranch in the neighborhood of Valley Center, told CNN in a telephone interview that ranch members became suspicious when a former ranch guest saw billboards urging help in finding Haylee and the two adults. Elliott also praised intense national news coverage from programs such as HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" and ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell,"" as well as local media and Clear Channel, which put up missing child billboards across the country. When she is returned to Ohio, Haylee will be placed in the custody of her grandmother, Elliott said. The U.S. Marshals Northern Ohio Violent Fugitive Task Force had offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of 27-year-old Potter. Potter was wanted on a state warrant for parole violation and a federal warrant for probation violation. He is a convicted tier three sex offender, according to the U.S. Marshals Service, a unit of the Justice Department. While on the run, Potter and Watson were reportedly seen on surveillance video on May 31 at a Wal-Mart Store in Marion, Ohio, 40 miles from Mansfield. Haylee was not on that video. Adding to concerns, Watson's roommate, Samantha Covert, said last week in an interview on ""Nancy Grace"" that she saw the little girl in bed with her mother and Potter the morning they disappeared. Covert said Watson carried a basket of clothing, pillows and blankets. Watson will likely face state charges, including harboring a fugitive, according to Elliott. In addition to other charges, he said Potter may be prosecuted under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, a federal sex offender registration and self-reporting law that carries a multiyear felony sentence if violated. On its Web site, the Morning Star Ranch describes itself as ""a community of growers of organic, pesticide-free avocados, grapefruit, persimmons, nuts and other produce."" Elliot said he believed it is a rehabilitation facility and also called it a Christian retreat.","Ohio girl found alive near San Diego, California, authorities say .

"(CNN)  -- John Daly dazzled the galleries at the Italian Open with his garish clothing but stayed in contention for the title after a second successive 69 in Turin. Daly rolls a putt during his second round of 69 at the Italian Open. Sporting a lime green top with a pair of psychedelic trousers, Daly was looking to improve on his tie for 31st in the Spanish Open. The two-time major champion is playing on the European Tour after being handed a six-month ban in the United States after a series of lurid headlines. But clearly showing the benefits of losing 20kg after having a gastric band fitted, Daly has shown glimpses of his best form. ""Yesterday could have been really low, but today could have been really high,"" he told the official European Tour Web site www.europeantour.com. ""I didn't hit it that great and one-putted the first five greens."" Daly was partnering home hope and 2007 champion Francesco Molinari and while struggled early on,  the Italian packed an eagle and two birdies into his first four holes to go joint leader. But he then slipped back to five-under as he matched Daly with a 69. Daniel Vancsik of Argentina was setting the pace on the second day after carding a six-under 65 for a halfway total of nine-under 133. Daly, who had not played for four months before teeing up in Spain, will look to continue his improved form in lucrative upcoming events. It was confirmed on Friday that he is to extend his stay by playing in the European Open at the London Club from May 28-31. It will be a first appearance in the tournament by the ""Wild Thing"" who is promoting a new range of clothing to match his more slimline figure.","John Daly cards second straight 69 in Turin to be handily-placed in Italian Open .

"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- Argentina's economy is in a perpetual state of uncertainty. As a result, Argentines have learned to live with what they've got -- and make things last. Lukas Desimone of Baumm cuts out a new bag from an old billboard advertisement. This resilience and resourcefulness has resulted in a wonderfully creative culture, where innovation and ingenuity are ever-present. In the wake of the country's 2001-2002 economic crash, many Argentines couldn't afford to travel abroad to forge new business relationships and absorb foreign ideas, so they did what they've always done -- they looked within for inspiration. In particular, Argentine fashion and designs have come to the forefront in recent years and gained worldwide accolades. These days, whenever I walk down the streets of Buenos Aires, especially in the trendy bohemian neighborhoods of Palermo and San Telmo, I see scores of boutique shops selling cool furnishings and hip clothing.  Watch Brian Byrnes' report from Argentina » . These are the places that always seem to attract the most attention from tourists; I don't think they expect to find such cutting-edge goods here, and are pleasantly surprised when they do. I've lived in Argentina since 2001, and witnessed the country struggle through the bad times and enjoy the subsequent recovery; in some sectors of society you could even call it a renaissance. So it comes as no surprise to me that Argentine designers are now meshing technology and fashion in totally new, and in many cases, eco-friendly ways. Living a ""green"" lifestyle is a relatively new concept in Argentina, and the country is definitely behind in regards to education and implementation of environmentally-friendly policies, but that has started to change in recent years, and as they are prone to do, many Argentines have embraced the idea with their typical gusto. I wanted to find out more about some of these new designers, so I visited two businesses in Buenos Aires that are creating items that are both innovative and unique, especially for this region of the world. We'll be featuring these two companies on CNN International's special weeklong programming called ""Going Green"" this week. The first place I went is Indarra DTX , housed in an enormous warehouse that also serves as a storage area for a supermarket. When I knocked on the non-descript gray metal door and passed through a loading dock area, I was thinking that I may have come to the wrong place. But cameraman Eduardo Aragona and I were soon greeted by a cheerful receptionist, Agustina, who led us into the spacious workspace and then to a corner area reserved for fashion fittings and meetings. There we met Julieta Gayoso, the 37-year-old owner of Indarra DTX. She told me that Indarra is a Basque word that means ""energy"" and she named the company such because her objective is to mesh technology and fashion in a way that advances the functionality of clothing. ""We are with our clothes 24 hours a day, so I think they need to provide us with other services, and these new benefits have to do with technology,"" says Gayoso. Indarra makes sleek jackets from eco-friendly textiles, like bamboo fibers and Lyocell. One of their most intriguing products is the FV Module Jacket, which comes with a small solar panel attached to the back. The panel absorbs sunlight and in turn can power your Ipod or charge your cell phone. I tried one on, and it was comfortable, practical -- and stylish. Although I must say, I would be a bit concerned about garnering glances on the street because of the solar square. It's not that noticeable, though, and it's worth the funny looks to save a little energy. Every bit counts, right? Next, we headed across town to the workshop and studio of Baumm, a self-proclaimed ""Recycle and Design Company"" housed on the second floor of a refurbished old home in the Villa Crespo neighborhood of Buenos Aires. Lukas Desimone, 29, and Rodrigo Chapero, 27, are the co-owners of the company, and when I first met them I thought they could easily be members of a skateboarding team. Baumm -- which means ""tree"" in German (they added an extra ""m"" so ""it would look cooler,"" according to Chapero) -- creates hip messenger bags and wallets from the vinyl that is used in billboards. When they first started, they would literally rip down the material from old street advertisements; now they have hired some people to bring the material to them. It's a fantastic idea, because as Chapero told me, the material is not recyclable and is toxic if burned, so essentially, once an advertising campaign is over, the vinyl is rolled up, stored away, and never used again. The Baumm guys saw the potential in this, and now make colorful, 100 percent original bags that retail for around $30 each. Every bag is hand-made, and literally one-of-a-kind. ""We are giving new life to something we take out of the trash,"" says Chapero.","CNN's Brian Byrnes reports from Argentina on trend for eco-friendly fashion .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Arrest warrants have been issued for another nine people associated with a fire at a day-care center in northwestern Mexico in June that killed 48 children, the state-run Notimex news agency said Saturday. Two girls lay flowers during a funeral of one of the 48 children who died in the day-care fire. The warrants are for the owners and legal representatives of the ABC day-care center in the city of Hermosillo in Sonora state, which burned down June 5, Notimex said. Officials have determined that the fire started at an air-conditioning unit at a government-owned warehouse in the same building as the day-care center. Fourteen children remain hospitalized, Notimex reported earlier. The latest arrest warrants are the third group to be issued since the fire. On Wednesday, the Mexican federal attorney general's office ordered the arrest of nine public officials from the Mexican Institute of Social Security, which owned the day-care center, as well as private individuals connected to the facility. Two weeks earlier, Mexican officials announced they had ordered the arrests of 14 people who worked at the warehouse. Parents of the dead children and others have held demonstrations in Hermosillo and Mexico City to protest what they see as foot-dragging by authorities in punishing the responsible parties.","Arrest warrants issued for nine people in connection with Mexico day-care fire .

"(CNN) -- Massachusetts sued the U.S. government on Wednesday, challenging the constitutionality of a federal law that defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman. The state of Massachusetts says the Defense of Marriage Act denies same-sex couples essential rights. ""We're taking this action today because, first, we believe that [the Defense of Marriage Act] directly interferes with Massachusetts' long-standing sovereign authority to define and regulate the marital status of its residents,"" Attorney General Martha Coakley said Wednesday afternoon. ""Massachusetts has a single category of married persons, and we view all married persons equally and identically,"" she said. ""DOMA divides that category into two distinct and unequal classes of marriage."" The lawsuit argues that the act, which became law in 1996, denies same-sex couples essential rights and protections, including federal income tax credits, employment and retirement benefits, health insurance coverage and Social Security payments. ""In enacting DOMA, Congress overstepped its authority, undermined states' efforts to recognize marriages between same-sex couples, and codified an animus towards gay and lesbian people,"" the state wrote in the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in federal court. Massachusetts, the first state to legalize gay marriage, said that about 16,000 same-sex couples have been married there since 2004, when it began issuing marriage licenses. Since that time, the lawsuit said, ""the security and stability of families has been strengthened in important ways throughout the state. "" The state is challenging Section 3 of the law, which defines marriage as ""a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife"" and a spouse as ""a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife."" Before the act, the lawsuit argues, defining marital status was the prerogative of the states. The law ""eviscerated more than 200 years of federal government deference to the states with respect to defining marriage,"" it said. The lawsuit also argues that the law forces Massachusetts to treat same-sex married couples differently from heterosexual married couples, particularly through determining who qualifies for the state's Medicaid program, known as MassHealth, and whether a same-sex spouse of a veteran can be buried in a veteran cemetery. ""But for DOMA, married individuals in same-sex relationships in the commonwealth would receive the same status, obligations, responsibilities, rights, and protections as married individuals in different-sex relationships under local, state, and federal laws,"" the lawsuit said. The defendants named in the lawsuit include the Department of Health and Human Services, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki and the United States itself. Charles Miller, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, said the department will review the case but noted that President Obama supports the legislative repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act. In March, Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders -- the same Boston-based group that successfully argued in 2003 for same-sex marriage rights in Massachusetts -- also sued the federal government over Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act. Besides Massachusetts, three other states recognize same-sex marriages: Connecticut, Maine, and Iowa. Vermont and New Hampshire will join their company when same-sex marriages become legal later this year and early next year.","Lawsuit challenges constitutionality of Defense of Marriage Act .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- The Iraqi government says it has banned all organized visits to Saddam Hussein's grave amid concern over support for the late dictator's former party. An Iraqi poet, left, gives a recital while children carry pictures of Saddam Hussein over his grave. A Cabinet statement on Monday said it had directed authorities in Salaheddin province and the Education Ministry to ""take all necessary measures"" to prevent such outings. The former dictator, along with his two sons and other relatives, is buried in his hometown of al-Ouja near Tikrit in Salaheddin north of Baghdad. And, Hussein supporters and schoolchildren have made visits there on the late dictator's birthday and hanging date. There have been videos on sites such as YouTube of people at the site. One video shows schoolchildren at the grave in December; they carried banners at Hussein's grave that said ""We won't forget you father"" and they read pro-Hussein poetry. The government move was made after a recent visit by schoolchildren to the grave, but no reason was given for the decision. However, the move reflects the concern of Iraq's government over the presence of the Baath Party in Iraq, Saddam Hussein's political movement. The party and its symbols have been banned in Iraq. On Saturday, government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh told reporters that while there can be government reconciliation with individual Baathists who have not committed crimes such as killing Iraqis, there can never be national reconciliation with the party itself. Salaheddin Gov. Mutasher Hussein Alaiwi, said he had not received any official directives yet, but said he would implement Cabinet orders when he receives them. The governor said that would apply to organized group visits, but they would not stop individual ones. A resident of al-Ouja told CNN the government had no right to stop visitors from going to their former president's tomb. ""Even if they put police and army outside the door, they will not stop us from visiting our president, our leader and our father,"" said Mohammed al- Nasiri. Hussein was executed in 2006 after an Iraqi court sentenced him to death for crimes against humanity.","Iraqi government bans all organized visits to Saddam Hussein's grave .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova's life has been a classic rags-to-riches fairytale, taking her from poverty in provincial Russia to a cosmopolitan life of wealth and aristocracy. Supermodel Natalia Vodianova was discovered in Moscow in a classic rags-to-riches tale. Her intelligence, poise and charm (as well as stunning features and long limbs), have propelled her from anonymity to being one of the most recognizable and respected models in the fashion industry. Her success has earned her the nickname Supernova. Not content to grace the covers of glossy magazines and the catwalks of the world's glamorous fashion capitals, Vodianova has also carved a role as a philanthropist. In 2005 she founded the Naked Heart Foundation, a charity that builds playgrounds for children across Russia. ""Giving back just feels so great and I always try to open each play park with myself being present for the children because it makes it more special for them. I go to very remote parts of Russia that are far from Moscow and it gives these children an extra message of love,"" she told CNN. Vodianova was born on February 28 1982 in Nizhni Novgorod, the fourth largest city in Russia. She lived in a poor district of the city with her mother and two sisters, one of whom has cerebral palsy. Watch Natalia Vodianova take CNN on a tour of Moscow » . The young Vodianova was regularly taken to the opera and the ballet by her grandparents. They offered some respite from the troubles at home and taught her the importance of manners. When Vodianova was 11 she began to help out on the family's fruit stall, and at the age of 15 she had moved into her own apartment with her best friend. ""It was a lot of survival and a lot of struggling but overall we were a good team,"" Vodianova told CNN. ""We worked really hard, all of us, and stood up for each other. My mum was amazing -- she lived for us. I appreciate what she has done for me and the way she raised me"" In 1999 a Parisian model scout held an open casting in Nizhni Novgorod. Vodianova impressed him and he sent her to Paris to sign with Viva Models on the condition that she learn English within three months. Luckily for her she took his advice. A year later Vodianova would find herself settled in Paris and sitting at a dinner party in the Pompidou Center restaurant. It was there she met artistic, English aristocratic playboy the Honorable Justin Portman, third son of the late Viscount Edward Henry Berkeley Portman. See Natalia Vodianova's life in front of the camera. » . The Portman family is one of the wealthiest in Britain, owning over 100 acres of prime land in central London and 3000 acres in Herefordshire, as well as expansive properties in Antigua and Australia. The pair fell in love and after a quick civil wedding Vodianova gave birth to their first child, Lucas, in December 2001, when she was still only 19. Vodianova lost a huge amount of weight after the birth and just a few weeks later at the castings for Paris Fashion Week she was the clear favorite among the designers. She opened and closed the prestigious Yves Saint Laurent show, as well as 40 other runway bookings and landed a Gucci perfume campaign, shot by iconic fashion photographer Mario Testino. On September 1 2002 Vodianova and Portman were married again, this time in a ceremony at St Vladimir's Cathedral in St Petersburg, followed by a lavish reception for 110 guests at the Palace of Catherine the Great. Over the next few years two more children followed. Her daughter Neva was born in March 2006 and another son, Viktor, was born in September 2007. Vodianova still found time to walk the runway for the world's great fashion houses, including Chanel, Givenchy, Versace, Balenciaga, Prada, Ralph Lauren, Christian Lacroix, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci and her good friend Diane Von Furstenberg. She ""officially"" retired from the catwalk after Valentino's emotional final show, during the Spring/Summer 2008 season. Afterwards, Vodianova took Valentino for a well-deserved holiday to her much-loved city of Moscow. ""Moscow is the heart of my country so it gathers the best of what I love about my country - and I can find it all here in this place. I love the people, I love what I find here, I love being here and it's sad that I don't actually live here. It would be my dream"" Vodianova told CNN. Following a brief return to the catwalk for Diane Von Furstenberg and Balenciaga at the end of 2008 the supermodel is now fronting campaigns for Calvin Klein and David Yurman jewelry. At the age of 27 Natalia Vodianova has achieved more than most people could ever dream of. She's got age on her side, as well as beauty, fame and fortune, and yet she remains admirably grounded. ""The most important things to me are my children, my family and my husband. It's really about people in general -- I really love people and I try to never say no if someone needs my help.""","Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova grew up in a poor neighborhood .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Profits at celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay's British restaurants plunged by nearly 90 percent in the last 12 months. Gordon Ramsay has become as successful on television as he has been off-screen. Run by the Scottish-born chef and his father-in-law Chris Hutcheson, Gordon Ramsay Holdings reported a drop in annual turnover from £41.6 million ($68 million) to £35 million ($57 million) in the year to August 2008, Britain's Press Association reported Friday. Pre-tax profits plummeted by over £3 million ($4.9 million) to £383,325 ($627,000), while net debt in the group, which includes London restaurants such as Claridges, Maze and the flagship Royal Hospital Road, soared to almost £9.5 million ($15.5 million). With spiraling debts and crippling tax bills, the star of TV shows such as ""Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares"" and ""Hell's Kitchen"" was forced to pump huge amounts of his own money into the business, even selling his prized Ferrari to raise funds, The Guardian newspaper said. Ramsay has attributed his business problems to over-ambitious expansion plans, in addition to the closure of two of his 11 London eateries. The Michelin-starred chef opened ten restaurants between 2007 and 2008, while The Savoy Grill was forced to close as the Savoy hotel was refurbished, and the lease at the Connaught expired. The 42-year old was also forced to review his company's international operations, closing restaurants in Paris, Los Angeles and Prague, The Times newspaper reported. ""Ambition overtook me. We thought we could do anything, that we couldn't fail,"" PA quoted Ramsay as saying recently. A full review of the group's operations was instigated in December as part of a refinancing deal with the Royal Bank of Scotland and to help the business get through the troubled economic times. ""2008 brought its own challenges, not just for our group, but for the industry as a whole and the broader economy,"" Hutcheson told PA. ""Whilst the restructuring has benefited the group, the significant contribution and commitment of all 750 staff to the business has been integral to moving us to a position of strength."" Ramsay has endured a difficult time recently. Last month he was criticized by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd after reportedly comparing television star Tracy Grimshaw to a pig during a live cooking show in Melbourne. His trademark colorful language also came under fire last year by another Australian lawmaker. However Ramsay told the country's Channel Nine Network, which broadcasts Kitchen Nightmares and Hell's Kitchen, that the shows emphasize the ""pressures of working in a restaurant kitchen.""","Turnover by Gordon Ramsay Holdings drops from $68M to $57M .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The family of Michael Jackson has been told by state officials that it may be possible to bury the singer at Neverland Ranch -- if the county gives the green light. Santa Barbara County says it hasn't yet been contacted about burying Michael Jackson at Neverland. Officials with Santa Barbara County, the site of the ranch, said Thursday that they have not yet been approached, and it was not clear whether the family had decided to pursue that option. A lawyer from the Jackson family contacted state officials recently about possibly burying Jackson at the ranch that was his home for almost two decades, said Amanda Fulkerson of California's State and Consumer Services Agency. To bury someone on private land in California is a two-step process. First, a certificate of authority is needed from the state Cemetery and Funeral Bureau -- easily obtainable by filling out a two-page application and paying $400. Next, the family needs approval from the county. No one from the Jackson camp has contacted county authorities yet, said county spokesman William Boyer. ""We have had no formal application either from the Jackson family or from the property owner,"" said Boyer, the communications director for the county. ""At that point, we would review the application and make a determination."" Boyer said Santa Barbara county has never been approached about burial on private land. California has had burials outside cemeteries, most notably that of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan at his presidential library in Ventura County's Simi Valley. Jackson's brother Jermaine said he'd like to see the singer buried at the ranch. But their father, Joe Jackson, said he opposes the site. The rest of the family has expressed no preference about Jackson's final resting place. Michael Jackson died June 25 of a cardiac arrest. The exact cause of death is pending toxicology results. Jackson purchased the Neverland Ranch -- named for the fictional world in J.M. Barrie's ""Peter Pan"" -- in 1987 and filled it with animals and amusement rides. Billionaire Tom Barrack Jr. gained control of the ranch through his company last year as part of a process to alleviate the singer's debts, believed to be in the millions. Soon after Jackson's death, Barrack said the property's future would be discussed at a later time.","State officials say Santa Barbara County has to approve burial on private property .

"(CNN) -- An Egyptian court on Thursday confirmed the death sentences of a business tycoon and a former police officer convicted of killing rising Lebanese pop star Suzanne Tamim. Hisham Talaat Moustafa, a real estate mogul, has been found guilty of Suzanne Tamim's murder. In a case that has captivated Egypt and the region because of the fame of the victim and one of the defendants, a judge sentenced to death real estate mogul Hisham Talaat Moustafa and former officer Muhsen el Sukkari last month. Tamim's body was found stabbed, with her throat slit, in her apartment in the United Arab Emirates in July 2008. The court's latest decision came after a review of the sentence by Egypt's grand mufti, the country's highest religious official. Because the two men were sentenced under Islamic law, it is widely expected they will be hanged. The court usually seeks to get the Mufti's ""advice only on any death sentence, according to the law,"" a legal source in Cairo told CNN. ""However, the Mufti's advice to the court is not binding at all,"" added the source, who asked not to be named. ""Even if the Mufti was against the death sentence, that will not have any effect on the judge's decision, who will have the final say,"" the source said. Since his 2003 appointment as grand mufti, Sheikh Ali Gomaa has received about 480 cases from the court that included death sentences. He supported the judge's decision in 478 and opposed twice, but the rule was implemented according to the court conviction. Moustafa's lawyer previously told reporters that he would appeal the conviction, saying there was ""a 1 million percent guarantee"" the sentence would be overturned. Prosecutors alleged Moustafa, a parliament member for the ruling National Democratic Party, paid el Sukkari $2 million to kill Tamim. During the trial, Moustafa's lawyer told CNN his client loved the singer but could not take Tamim as a second wife because his family objected. Polygamy is legal in Egypt, and it's not unusual for men such as Moustafa, a married father of three, to take on additional wives. Prosecutors have said Tamim's death was a ""means of taking revenge"" but have not elaborated. Moustafa and el Sukkari claim the prosecution's evidence could have been fabricated or tampered with by UAE authorities and should not be used against them. Although Tamim was killed in the UAE, the Egyptian judiciary tried the case in Cairo because the accused were arrested in Egypt. After Moustafa's arrest in September, Egyptian authorities indicted him, stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and jailed him pending trial. He also resigned as chairman of Talaat Moustafa Group -- a conglomerate with construction and real estate arms that was founded by his father, Talaat Moustafa. Moustafa's brother, Tarek Talaat Moustafa, now chairs the company.

"(AOL Autos) -- Automotive expert Tom Torbjornsen answers a question about how to diagnose an exhaust problem and what to do about it. Dear Tom, Smoke is coming out of the tailpipe of my 2002 Chrysler Sebring with 90,000 miles. Is this a big problem? I have to put a quart of oil a week in the engine. What should I do? -- Sally, New York . Sally, Generally, engines burn oil due to a few reasons: bad valve seals, worn valve guides, pressurized crankcase (oil pan) due to a clogged PCV valve or breather system, and blow-by from worn piston rings. Bad valve seals: The valves are located in the cylinder head above the combustion chamber. Oil is pumped at 40 to 80 PSI (pounds/square inch) of pressure into the top of the head, lubricating the valve-train. The valves have seals to stop the flow of oil down into the engine when the valve is open. If the seals fail then oil is allowed to flow down into the combustion chamber and is burned. Worn valve guides: A small cylindrical chamber called a valve guide does just what its name says ... it guides the valves. These guides wear out over time causing eccentricity (slop). The excess gap that forms allows oil to flow down the valve stem into the combustion chamber to be burned. Normally the valve seal stops this flow. However, in this case the gap is too great for the seal to work. AOL Autos: Should you use synthetic motor oil? Pressurized crankcase due to clogged PCV or breather system: Your car's engine is a giant air pump, consequently it must breathe. The PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) system allows the engine to exhaust the excess pressure buildup (which is a natural phenomenon of the internal combustion engine). Carbon is a by-product of an engine and can build up in the PCV system, clogging the breathing passages. This in turn pressurizes the oil pan and pushes oil up into the fuel delivery system where it is fed into the engine and burned. AOL Autos: Do I need to replace my air filter? Blow-by from worn piston rings: The pistons in your car's engine have seals around them in the form of rings. These rings have two functions: (1) they seal the combustion chamber so that the power developed from the firing of the cylinder is not lost. (2) They provide vital lubrication to the cylinder walls. When the rings wear out, the pressure from combustion reverses down into the oil pan, pressurizing it, and forcing oil into the valve covers. From there it goes through the breather system, back into the fuel delivery system, and into the engine to be burned. I have to put a quart of oil a week in the engine. Is this a big problem? It's hard to say without performing some diagnostics on the engine. A quart of oil a week is excessive. It could be due to a plugged PCV or excessive internal engine wear. Take the car into the shop for engine diagnostics. My guess is that the tech will perform a compression test along with a cylinder leak down test after he/she determines if the PCV system is open. During these tests the tech tries to determine if there is loss of engine compression, blow-by, or excessive oil consumption due to ring wear. If excessive ring wear is discovered then further engine teardown will be necessary to determine if the engine needs to be rebuilt or replaced. AOL Autos: How often should you change your oil . What is the difference between blue and white smoke? The engine can emit different colors of smoke: . Blue smoke: Blue typically means that engine oil is being burned in the combustion chamber. In rare cases, when a vehicle is equipped with a transmission that uses a device called a vacuum modulator valve (to soften shifts between gears according to engine vacuum) the diaphragm can break inside the valve and cause transmission fluid to be sucked into the engine via the vacuum line feeding the valve and burn. AOL Autos: Fluid leaks: unsafe and expensive . White smoke: White can mean one of two things. (1) Water condensation from a blown and leaking head gasket: This gasket is the seal between the cylinder head and engine block. Water runs through channels called water jackets that line the cylinder walls and thus carry away heat. When the head gasket blows, the seal between the cylinder head and engine block breaks and water is allowed to enter the combustion chamber. This water is emitted from the engine in the form of water vapor or steam and it is white in color. (2) Excessive gas: Fuel delivery systems sometimes falter and dump excessive amounts of raw fuel into the intake plenum. When this happens, the amount of fuel is too much for the engine to process. Hence, it exits the engine and tailpipe in the form of pure white fuel vapor. It stinks like raw gas and can be dangerous if it ignites in the hot muffler and catalytic converter. I have witnessed exhaust systems literally blown off the vehicle from the explosion that ensued from ignition of a gas-filled catalytic converter. This condition must be fixed immediately to prevent internal engine damage or worse yet, a serious fire. Can I add oil or coolant and keep driving the vehicle until I can afford to fix it? Yes. However, be advised that such maladies never get better by themselves; and they always get worse with time. There is a real possibility that you will get caught on the road driving at highway speeds (thinking you added enough oil, transmission fluid or engine coolant) and the oil runs out, causing a catastrophic failure. In general, when it comes to a need for auto repair, conditions never improve on their own. You must maintain your vehicle if you want to get the maximum life out of it and, in the long run, spend the least amount of money.

"(CNN) -- A multiagency search is under way for the killers of two U.S. citizens in northern Mexico, according to Chihuahua state officials. A girl stands at the coffin of Mormon church leader Benjamin LeBaron in Chihuahua State. Benjamin LeBaron, 32, and his brother-in-law, Luis Widmar, in his mid-30s, were beaten and shot to death after armed men stormed into their home in Galeana on Tuesday morning. The killers have yet to be identified, but the case seems to be connected to local drug lords, said Arturo Sandoval, a spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office. Sandoval said a note was found on LeBaron's body, but he could not confirm the contents. Local media reported that the note indicated the slayings were in retribution for the capture of 25 drug suspects in a nearby town. LeBaron's younger brother, Eric, was kidnapped in May and returned unharmed after a week. The incident prompted LeBaron to become a nationally recognized anti-crime activist who moved the local community to take a stand. ""There are no leaders here, or we are all leaders,"" LeBaron's brother, Julian LeBaron, told CNN television affiliate KINT in El Paso, Texas. ""If they kill my brother another three will take his place, and if they kill us, another hundred will take their place. We are not giving up. No way."" The LeBaron brothers belonged to the ""Community of LeBaron"" in the Municipality of Galeana, a township founded by ex-communicated Mormons.","Benjamin LeBaron and his brother-in-law are shot dead in their home .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- A portion of a partially built bridge for New Delhi's metro rail network collapsed Sunday, killing five people and injuring 15, authorities said. A crane clears away wreckage from a collapsed carriageway on Sunday in New Delhi, India. The crash occurred when a metal beam supporting pillars gave way, Delhi Metro Rail Corp. spokesman Anuj Dayal told CNN. Concrete slabs came crashing down, burying workers beneath, officials said. The dead included one site engineer, said Mohammad Akhlaque, police sub-inspector. The man in charge of building the Metro system offered to quit the project Sunday. ""I take full moral responsibility for this accident. And having taken this moral responsibility, I have decided to resign as the managing director of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation,"" Elattuvalapil Sreedharan told a news conference. Sreedharan, 77, however, noted that Sunday's crash would set the metro project back by three months. New Delhi launched its metro system six years ago, a project that cut through India's bureaucratic red-tape that usually holds back big infrastructure programs. Construction on new lines has been proceeding at a frenzied pace as the city gets ready to host the Commonwealth Games in 2010. Hailed as a relief in India's traffic-congested capital, the metro has a tarnished safety record. Part of a another bridge being built to extend the rail system collapsed last October, pinning a bus underneath and killing its driver.","Five killed, 15 injured when partially built bridge collapses in New Delhi .

"ACCRA, Ghana (CNN)  -- President Obama reached out to Africa on Saturday with a wide-ranging address praising the continent's steady achievements, but he called its persistent violent conflicts ""a millstone around Africa's neck."" President Obama speaks before Ghana's Parliament on Saturday. ""Despite the progress that has been made -- and there has been considerable progress in parts of Africa -- we also know that much of that promise has yet to be fulfilled,"" Obama said in a speech to the parliament of Ghana, a western African nation seen as a model of democracy and growth for the rest of the continent. Ghana was the first sub-Saharan nation to gain independence, in 1957, and Obama continually cited the nation during his speech for its stability, political strides and painstaking economic progress. Its stability stands in contrast to other hot spots on the continent, such as Zimbabwe, where the society is in economic and political turmoil; Sudan, where fighting rages in the Darfur region; and Somalia, where a shaky transitional government is now battling an Islamic insurgency. Ghana, with a population of 24 million, was once a major slave trading center. Obama visited the Cape Coast Castle, a British outpost where slaves were held until shipped overseas, along with his daughters.  Watch Obama's remark after touring Cape Coast Castle » . ""I think it was particularly important for Malia and Sasha, who are being raised in a very blessed way, that history can take some cruel turns,"" he said. ""And hopefully, one of the things that was imparted to them during this trip is their sense of obligation to fight oppression and cruelty wherever it appears."" Obama, whose father was Kenyan, compared the history to that of the Holocaust, Nazi Germany's efforts to exterminate the Jews of Europe during World War II. ""It's one of those things that you don't forget about,"" he told CNN in an interview scheduled to air Monday on ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""I think it's important that the way we think about it, the way it's taught, is not one in which there's simply a victim and a victimizer, and that's the end of the story,"" he said. ""I think the way it has to be thought about, the reason it's relevant, is whether it's what's happening in Darfur or what's happening in the Congo or what's happening in too many places around the world, the capacity for cruelty still exists.""  Watch how Ghana is celebrating the Obamas' visit » . But he told lawmakers that Ghana now shows ""a face of Africa that is too often overlooked by a world that sees only tragedy or the need for charity."" While the nation-building the country exemplifies may lack ""drama of the 20th century's liberation struggles,"" he said ""it will ultimately be more significant."" As he has in past remarks, including his Cairo address last month about U.S.-Muslim relations, Obama stressed the superiority of governments that ""respect the will of their own people,"" saying they foster more prosperity and stability than governments that don't.  Watch Obama deliver speech to Ghanaian lawmakers » . ""No business wants to invest in a place where the government skims 20 percent off the top, or the head of the Port Authority is corrupt,"" he said. ""No person wants to live in a society where the rule of law gives way to the rule of brutality and bribery. That is not democracy, that is tyranny, even if occasionally you sprinkle an election in there."" Even Kenya, his father's homeland, continues to struggle with tribalism and corruption, he said. That eastern African nation ""had a per-capita economy larger than South Korea's when I was born"" and now, he says, it has been ""badly outpaced."" But he said Kenya has restored stability after the violence that followed the disputed 2007 election. South Africa has had high voter turnout in recent elections, and Zimbabwe's Election Support Network has defended the right to vote.  Watch report on Ghanaians' reaction to Obama's remarks » . ""Make no mistake: history is on the side of these brave Africans, and not with those who use coups or change constitutions to stay in power. Africa doesn't need strongmen, it needs strong institutions,"" he said. He said his administration will work ""to support those who act responsibly and to isolate those who don't, and that is exactly what America will do."" As for the economy and opportunity, he said African nations need to stop focusing on one particular commodity, such as oil or cocoa, and ""promote multiple export industries, develop a skilled work force, and create space for small and medium-sized businesses that create jobs."" He cited ""our $3.5 billion food security initiative"" and said ""new methods and technologies for farmers -- not simply sending American producers or goods to Africa"" is what is needed.  See where Ghana is located » . Obama also made reference to climate and energy challenges, saying the developed world should work with Africa to confront such problems. He said Africa has much potential to exploit its wind and solar power and geothermal energy and biofuels. As for disease, Obama said strides are being made in dealing with HIV/AIDS and malaria, but ""too many still die from diseases that shouldn't kill them."" He also indicated that there need to be ways to keep African doctors and nurses from going overseas and creating gaps in primary care. ""When children are being killed because of a mosquito bite, and mothers are dying in childbirth, then we know that more progress must be made."" He said his administration has committed $63 billion to fight disease, praising the ""strong efforts"" of his predecessor, George W. Bush.  Watch Ed Henry's report Obama's emotional visit to Africa » . Obama welcomed efforts by the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States to help resolve conflict. He said the United States ""will stand behind efforts to hold war criminals accountable"" and that the Pentagon's Africa Command will fight ""common challenges to advance the security of America, Africa and the world.""  Watch Obama's remarks as his visit to Ghana concludes » . ""We all have many identities -- of tribe and ethnicity; of religion and nationality. But defining oneself in opposition to someone who belongs to a different tribe, or who worships a different prophet, has no place in the 21st century,"" he said.

Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board continue to piece together details from the double engine failure that hit the plane after it took off from New York's LaGuardia Airport for Charlotte, North Carolina. The jet's left engine, which apparently tore away from the plane on landing impact, was raised from the bottom of the Hudson on Friday. Sullenberger reported to air controllers that his plane had hit birds shortly before both engines shut down. On Saturday, the NTSB said a preliminary examination of the left engine found evidence of ""soft body impact damage,"" the same kind of damage reported on the right engine. An NTSB spokesman said that there was no evidence of organic material such as a dead bird in the left engine but that was not surprising because the engine had been under water for a week. Although the NTSB has not officially confirmed reports of a bird strike, the agency's findings and statements have not done anything to discount the bird-strike reports. Both engines will be shipped to the manufacturer in Ohio, where NTSB investigators will tear them down completely for examination.","NEW: Left engine shows evidence of ""soft body impact damage,"" NTSB says .

Sandra Boss testifies about the 12  years she spent with a man she thought was one of the Rockefellers. Financial consultant Sandra Lynn Boss, 42, was stone-faced and repeatedly referred to her former husband as ""the defendant"" as she took the witness stand Monday at his kidnapping trial. She now lives in London, England, with the girl, Reigh, who just turned 8. Her former husband, German-born Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter, 48, is accused of kidnapping their daughter in July, and taking the child to Baltimore, Maryland, where he'd bought a townhouse near the harbor. His trial began last week in Boston, Massachusetts. Gerhartsreiter is charged with the kidnapping of a minor by a relative, assault and battery, assault with a dangerous weapon and furnishing a false name to a law enforcement officer. His defense attorneys told jurors they will present evidence that Gerhartsreiter was mentally ill. As she began the narrative of their whirlwind romance and 12-year marriage, Boss described how she was charmed by a handsome stranger she knew as Clark Rockefeller, who was host of a party based on the mystery game Clue. Boss testified that she came to the party dressed as the character ""Miss Scarlet"" and fell for him immediately during the summer of 1993, when she was a student at Harvard's business school. ""I thought he was very attractive,"" she testified. ""He was very well dressed, very fit. I thought he was very polite and could talk about anything, and also very charming."" She told jurors that the man she married in 1995 told her he grew up in a townhouse on Manhattan's prestigious Sutton Place, that he had suffered amnesia and couldn't speak after falling down a flight of stairs as a child, and that his parents had been killed in an accident when he was in college. He also said he attended Yale University under an early admissions program when he was 14 and helped foreign governments renegotiate their debt. She believed it, she said, because ""he was one of the most intelligent people"" she'd met. Boss said he proposed to her during the spring of 1994, during a trip to Maine. They were married in a Quaker ceremony on Nantucket soon after she graduated from business school. Only eight people attended -- and not a single Rockefeller. Her new husband explained that he'd had a falling out with his family. The newlyweds set up housekeeping in New York. During the early days of their marriage, she said, her husband was very supportive, but his demeanor soon changed. He became possessive and controlling, she said. Later, he ""began to show temper,"" she said. ""He wanted to walk me to and from work every day. He began to be less supportive of my seeing my friends,"" she said. His criticism of her friends left her confused and in tears, she said. By early 1996, she said, ""It became a very stressful relationship from my point of view."" The couple moved to Nantucket, then to Woodstock, Vermont, then back to Nantucket before buying a house in Cornish, New Hampshire. The marriage did not improve. By the summer of 2000, Boss said she was considering a separation. She spent more time in New York away from her husband, but he wooed her back. In September, Boss learned she was pregnant and vowed to work at the marriage for the sake of their child. Their daughter, Reigh, was born in May 2001. After hiring two nannies, Gerhartsreiter said he could do a better job and became the primary caretaker. In September 2004, Boss transferred to her company's Boston office to cut her commute time so she could spend more time with Reigh. The marriage ultimately fell apart and the couple separated in January 2007. Boss had always been the sole income earner and said she began to doubt that her husband was really a Rockefeller. She said she hired a private investigator who came up with little information about ""Clark Rockefeller."" Shortly after that revelation, Gerhartsreiter agreed to give Boss full custody of Reigh. He received  $800,000, two cars and her engagement ring. Boss and Reigh moved to London in late December 2007. Gerhartsreiter did not respond to e-mails or calls from his daughter, Boss said, and never initiated contact with her during the first six months after she and her mother moved to London. On July 27, 2008 -- during the first of three annual supervised visits in Boston -- Gerhartsreiter allegedly abducted his daughter, nicknamed ""Snooks."" Boss described reuniting with the child at the FBI field office in Baltimore after Gerhartsreiter's arrest a week later. She said Reigh had lost weight and ""seemed younger."" Boss returns to the stand on Tuesday, when she will undergo cross-examination.","Ex-wife testifies at kidnapping trial of Rockefeller impostor .

"LOS ANGELES (CNN)  -- Pop singer Britney Spears must submit to random drug tests, a judge has ordered after finding she engaged in ""habitual, frequent, and continuous use of controlled substances and alcohol."" Kevin Federline and Britney Spears are in the middle of a bitter custody battle over their two sons. The ruling by Superior Court Commissioner Scott Gordon provided no details and did not name any specific drugs, stating only that the findings were ""based on the evidence presented."" Spears must also spend eight hours a week working with a parenting coach who will observe her interactions with her children, according to the ruling released Tuesday. Efforts to contact the singer's lawyers, Marci Levine and Mel Goldman, were unsuccessful late Tuesday. The ruling comes during Spears' custody battle with ex-husband Kevin Federline. The documents underscore the bitter nature of the fight over their two sons, Sean Preston and Jayden. The two have split custody equally, but Federline is asking for the arrangements to be shifted to 70-30 in his favor. After a closed hearing Monday, Gordon ordered Spears, 25, to undergo random drug tests twice a week. He told both parents to avoid alcohol or ""other non-prescription controlled substances"" 12 hours before taking custody of the children. He also barred the exes from making ""derogatory remarks about the other party and the other party's family or significant other"" during the case, ordered them to go through ""joint co-parenting counseling"" and barred them from using corporal punishment on the boys. Spears and Federline were married for two years before their divorce was finalized in July. Federline's attorney, Mark Vincent Kaplan, told reporters on Monday he didn't see the custody battle being resolved before scheduled hearings in November and December. Tuesday's order comes amid a career freefall for Spears, who has a new album due in stores November 13. Critics said her September 9 ""comeback"" performance on the MTV Video Music Awards was lackluster and said she appeared overweight in her sequined, two-piece costume. Her former divorce lawyer, Laura Wasser, resigned as her legal representative in the past few days after defending her outside the courthouse on Friday, telling reporters the singer ""just wants to be a mom."" And Spears' management company, the Firm, has quit after representing the singer for a little more than a month. ""It saddens us to confirm media reports that we have terminated our professional relationship with Britney Spears,"" the company announced Monday. ""We believe Britney is enormously talented and has made a terrific record, but current circumstances have prevented us from properly doing our job. We wish Britney the best.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The 1992 Hollywood movie ""Lorenzo's Oil,"" depicts the true story of Lorenzo, a five-year-old boy who suffered from adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a rare and incurable disease that slowly destroys the entire nervous system. Michaela Damin and her son, Nick, who suffers from  an extremely rare disease that affects the heart. The movie showed how Lorenzo's grave physical and mental decline was finally stopped when his tireless parents found a treatment based on a mixture of oils, despite skepticism from doctors. The film illustrated perfectly the struggle faced by patients suffering from any of 6,000 known rare conditions worldwide, generally known as orphan diseases. Michaela Damin, founder of the Barth Syndrome Trust, whose son, Nick, suffers from this crippling syndrome that affects the heart and immune system and only has 130 known sufferers worldwide, told CNN: ""It can take years to get the correct diagnosis and even then there may be no expert who knows what to do next."" The fact remains that rare diseases are still mostly overlooked by pharmaceutical companies because of the small patient population and lack of financial incentives. Drug companies tend to focus on the more lucrative ""blockbuster drugs"" for common diseases, at the expense of cures for rare conditions. The term ""orphan drug"" was originally coined because the pharmaceutical industry took little or no interest in discovery, development and marketing of drugs for rare diseases. According to the European Organization for Rare Diseases, rare diseases affect between three and five percent of the population in developed countries. In the European Union, a disease is considered rare if it affects fewer than five in 10,000 people, while in the United States the disease must affect fewer than 200,000 people. Many countries, such as the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom, have therefore attempted to encourage pharmaceutical companies to invest in orphan diseases by giving them tax incentives, fee reductions and extensions of patent rights. The United States was the first country to develop an orphan drug law in 1983, followed by Japan and Australia. In 1997, the Australian Orphan Drugs policy was set up to help manufacturers overcome the high cost of marketing drugs which have not proved to be commercially viable. Since 1998, the EU has also devoted time and resources to rare diseases and passing laws that have led to more research and development in the field. But even when treatments are developed, they generally remain extremely expensive.  See where to get help for rare diseases » . Genzyme, one of the pharmaceutical companies that focuses primarily on rare diseases, has long charged more than $300,000 a year for patients on Cerezyme, a drug used to treat Gaucher disease, an extremely rare condition that causes bone deterioration, among other symptoms. Do you know someone who has a rare disease? Tell us in the Sound off below or send us an iReport . Only about 5,000 people around the world are taking Cerezyme. Genzyme says that justifies the high price.  See images of children living with rare diseases » . ""The cost of developing therapies for very rare diseases is not substantially lower than those for common diseases and can take years,"" Steve Bates of Genzyme told CNN. In their 2005 book on orphan drugs, Daniel Hagn and Oliver Schoffski wrote that on average, only one of 5,000 to 10,000 substances tested gets as far as market authorization and that it takes eight to 12 years and €895 million ($1.2 billion)  to develop and market a new drug. Bates said Genzyme needs to recoup those high costs and that profits are the motive for further research: ""Our profits are then re-directed into research for new drugs."" Genzyme's global revenue in 2008 was $4.6 billion, Bates told CNN. A spokeswoman for French drug firm Hoffmann-La Roche told CNN: ""There is a Roche Working Group on orphan diseases, but not a separate department."" She declined to say how much the company's resources were allocated for research into the diseases. While Pfizer spokesman Oliver Stohlmann told CNN in a written statement: ""Pfizer is one of the leading companies in terms of approved orphan drugs in Europe. It currently has four marketed medicines out of 50 on the EU orphan drugs register. ""Pfizer also has a new cancer therapy that was originally developed for a very rare tumor type but is now being tested in more common forms of cancer,"" he added. Campaigners for rare disease causes say the prohibitively high costs of orphan drugs is a major concern for sufferers, who are often forced to pay for their own treatments. Peter Saltonstall, president of the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), which represents nearly 30 million Americans who have rare diseases, told CNN: ""The biggest issue for us moving forward is that people are able to afford to pay for treatment. ""[In the U.S.] most rare disease therapies are expensive and patients are being forced to pay for things out of pocket because of lifetime caps on insurance."" In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (NHS) subsidizes many of the drugs for rare diseases, but not in all cases. The drugs need to pass certain stringent rules, such as fairness of asking price and effectiveness of the drug. Dr. Ed Jessop of the UK's NHS said he believes these drugs should only be subsidized if they ""are dramatically effective, work in virtually every patient and if we believe we are paying a fair price."" Some patients therefore still end up footing the bill for drugs that have been deemed too expensive or not effective enough. Alastair Kent, President of the UK's Genetic Interest Group (GIG) told CNN that is why the price of treatment should reflect the input gone into developing the product. But, he said, ""there are currently no mechanisms to see if the price of some treatments is fair"" Kent would therefore like to see more publicly funded research. He also believes pharmaceutical companies should share the knowledge they don't use: ""There is a lot of knowledge in the private sector that just gets filed away and we need to find ways to get that knowledge out."" In the meantime, however, Kent is campaigning for the UK to sign a European Union resolution to be passed on June 8 and 9 that calls for member states to create national plans on rare diseases. He hopes a national plan will ease some of the burden that is currently carried by patients. It would lead to better communication between the various bodies that deal with rare diseases and enhance care, Kent said. But for the moment, Michaela Damin of Barth Trust explained, patients still need to take matters in their own hands: . ""Proper communication is really lacking and some of our conditions are so rare, that in the end, we have to become the expert on our own conditions.""","More than 6,000 known rare diseases worldwide .
30 million Europeans have a rare disease at some point in their lives .

"(CNN)  -- Tamil Tiger rebels acknowledged the death of their leader Sunday, nearly a week after the Sri Lankan government said it had recovered the body of Velupillai Prabhakaran and declared victory in the country's 25-year civil war with the rebels. In this picture taken 27 November 2003, Velupillai Prabhakaran stands next to an LTTE flag. Prabhakaran ""attained martyrdom fighting the military oppression of the Sri Lankan state"" on May 17, according to Tamilnet.com, a rebel Web site, citing the group's international affairs spokesman. On Tuesday, President Mahinda Rajapaksa declared victory against the Tamil Tigers. ""We are celebrating the defeat of terrorism,"" he said in a nationally televised speech before parliament. ""We have won and restored democracy in the country."" The president declared a national holiday for the following day to celebrate the war's end and begin a new phase in the country's history.   Watch the victory parade » . A short time after the presidential address, the military announced that it had recovered the body of Prabhakaran, leader and founder of the Tamil Tigers. The rebels initially denied the death of their leader, claiming on Tamilnet.com that Prabhakaran was ""alive and safe."" The defense ministry said the bodies of Prabhakaran and 18 other senior rebel leaders were among corpses found in mop-up operations, after government troops routed the Tigers -- formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The leaders included Prabhakaran's eldest son, Charles Anthony, as well as Pottu Amman, the Tigers' intelligence leader, according to the ministry.  Watch the U.N. chief discuss the humanitarian crisis » . Prabhakaran founded the Tamil Tigers, who have been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries. It initiated the use of women in suicide attacks and, according to the FBI, invented the explosive suicide belt. Prabhakaran is accused of masterminding the killing of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 in the Tamil-dominated Indian state of Tami Nadu. Sri Lankan authorities allege that Prabhakaran was avenging Gandhi's decision to send Indian peacekeepers to Sri Lanka. Two years later, a Tigers suicide bomber, allegedly acting on Prabhakaran's orders, detonated explosives that killed Sri Lanka's then-president, Ranasinghe Premadasa, during a rally.

"(CNN) -- French Open champion Roger Federer dramatically withdrew from the Halle Open tournament on Tuesday saying he was ""overwhelmed and exhausted"" after his Paris triumph. Roger Federer quits the Halle Open saying he is  ""overwhelmed and exhausted"" after his Paris triumph. Federer beat Swede Robin Soderling in Sunday's Roland Garros final to complete his Grand Slam haul and equal the record 14 'major' wins by Pete Sampras. He traditionally uses the German follow-up event as his warm-up for Wimbledon which starts on June 22. ""I sincerely apologise to the tournament organisers, my competitors, and my fans in Germany,"" Swiss world number two Federer said in a statement on his Web site. ""I only hope they will understand that I still feel emotionally overwhelmed and exhausted by the incredible events of the past few days. ""It is hard for me to admit, but I simply cannot imagine giving my best effort in another tournament right away and I don't want to risk injury if I am not 100 percent prepared. ""I need to rest and recuperate, but I look forward to returning to Halle in 2010 to go for my sixth title."" Serb Novak Djokovic, who scored a straight sets win over Italy's Simone Bolelli 7-5 6-2 in 84 minutes earlier in the day, has now been promoted to top seed. ""For my first game here, I was pretty happy,"" said Djokovic, who faces France's Florent Serra in the second round. Djokovic is using the grass-court tournament to prepare for the next Grand Slam tournament -- and he hopes injury worry Rafael Nadal will be at Wimbledon to defend his crown. Nadal withdrew from the Queen's tournament this week with a knee injury and the Spaniard says he will travel to London next week before making a final decision. ""I hope he makes it, it would be a shame for the tournament if the defending champion and world number one doesn't play through injury,"" said Djokovic. Earlier, third-seeded Fernando Verdasco suffered a first round exit when he was beaten by Germany's Philipp Petzschner 3-6 7-6 6-4. Former world number one Lleyton Hewitt tipped Federer to set a new Grand Slam record at Wimbledon after easing into the second round at Queen's. Australian Hewitt took just 44 minutes to sink Argentine Eduardo Schwank 6-1 6-0 and then turned his thoughts to Federer whose triumph in Paris saw him draw level with Pete Sampras on 14 Grand Slam wins. ""It was an amazing achievement,"" said Hewitt. ""His record speaks for itself. From what I saw of the match, he played his best tennis in the final. ""There was a lot of pressure and expectation on him. He came out and played one of his best matches. I think coming to Wimbledon is probably his favorite tournament of the year, so he's going to be feeling pretty confident."" He added: ""Roger's going to be the one to beat. But Andy Murray has got a good chance, no doubt about that, both here and Wimbledon. He's number three in the world at the moment and plays extremely well on this surface.""

"(CNN) -- The father of a New Year's Day baby pleaded guilty Thursday to killing the infant by violently shaking him. Camryn Jakeb Wilson was the first baby born in 2008 in Summit County, Ohio, arriving at 12:33 a.m. January 1. Craig Wilson's guilty plea in Akron, Ohio, to murder and child endangering charges ended a yearlong saga surrounding the death of Camryn Jakeb Wilson, the first baby born in Summit County, Ohio, in 2008. ""This type of crime is always difficult to understand, but today I do hope that Camryn's mother has some closure and that today is one step toward healing,"" Summit County Prosecutor Sherri Bevan Walsh said. Camryn's mother, Crystal Wilson, had left the 10-week-old infant in his father's care on March 12, 2008, while she attended a meeting. When she returned to their Cuyahoga Falls home she found Camryn in a baby swing, listless and breathing abnormally while her husband of 10 months sat on a couch. Doctors at Akron Children's Hospital quickly determined that Camryn had suffered traumatic brain injuries and bleeding in his eyes that could only have been caused by violent shaking.  Learn about shaken baby syndrome » . Camryn died in his mother's arms, surrounded by other family members, on March 25, 2008, shortly after being removed from life support. Craig Wilson, 29, confessed to police that he was frustrated after an argument with his wife over his ex-girlfriend and a child he had with her. He shook and squeezed Camryn before laying him in the swing but hadn't intended to hurt the infant, he told police. The National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome estimates that as many as 1,400 babies annually are injured or killed by shaking. Despite the confession, the case dragged on for a year after an autopsy showed Camryn had suffered broken ribs prior to the fatal shaking. The finding raised the possibility that another person had previously abused Camryn and perhaps contributed to his death, said Jonathan T. Sinn, Craig Wilson's defense attorney.  See photos of the family » . Craig Wilson's trial was scheduled to begin Monday. Sinn had hoped to negotiate a plea deal with prosecutors that would send Craig Wilson to prison for a flat 20-year term, but in the end, prosecutors wouldn't budge. ""From the moment my client was arrested, he took responsibility for his actions and for the killing of his child,"" Sinn said. ""From a human perspective, that's very admirable. From a defense perspective, it makes it difficult to mount a defense when somebody acknowledges completely their guilt."" Judge Lynne Callahan sentenced Wilson to 15 years to life. He is unlikely to be paroled in less than 20 years, Sinn said.","Ohio man pleads guilty to murder, endangering children .

"(CNET) -- Craigslist's managers have complied with the wishes of most of the state attorneys general who demanded they rid the site of prostitution ads. Craigslist says it has removed prostitution ads, but some issues remain. The Web's dominate classifieds publication replaced its controversial ""erotic"" section with a new ""adult"" category. And where Craigslist once relied on readers to flag dodgy advertisements, the company's employees now review every ad submitted to the adult area before they appear online. Yet, the site has been unable to block every solicitation for sex. Catherine, a self-described sex worker from San Francisco, confirmed for CNET that she successfully posted an ad for her services to the adult section late last week. She wished to remain anonymous, so neither the ad's photo nor text can be included in this story. Regardless, it isn't hard to find questionable ads in Craigslist's new adult section. The most noticeable difference between Craigslist's erotic and adult categories is the photos. In the adult section, the photos are less provocative. Less skin is showing. When it comes to the text, however, the two sections are very similar. Both are packed with ads for massage services. Ads in both areas include descriptions of the masseuse's breast size (""I'm a natural C cup"") and they are often photographed dressed in their underwear. Even if most of these services are legitimate, and only a few are veiled offers of sex in the new adult area, plenty of others make little if any pretense about what they offer. These ads typically include words such as ""busty,"" or ""fantasy girl"" in their descriptions. Often, they feature photos of a woman or man dressed provocatively in their underwear or bathing suit. Some include hourly rates. Clearly, Craigslist faces a significant challenge as it tries to purge prostitution from its Web pages. While it can ban nude photos and overt offers of sex, how can anyone expect the site to outlaw ads featuring photos of bikini-clad women offering phone numbers? One can find racier images in department store ads. The Internet has made it easier for merchants of all kinds to conduct commerce and reach wider audiences. Should anyone be surprised that the sex trade has benefited from this as well. If Craigslist were to disappear tomorrow, does anyone really expect that would curb prostitution? A review of some competing online classifieds shows that while Craigslist has been a popular destination for sex workers, it is by no means the only one. For example, Backpages.com is an online classified publication and Craigslist competitor. The content it produces can also be found on the Web sites of some entertainment and alternative publications in major metropolitan areas, such as New York's Village Voice or San Francisco's SFWeekly. Craigslist is G-rated compared with the photos found in Backpages' adult section. Ads included nude photos while others showed people engaged in sexual intercourse. A common ad would show a bare chested woman asking men to call her at a phone number. In the area of Backpages that services Charleston, S.C., one ad found on Tuesday by CNET featured a photo of a bare-chested woman apparently engaged in masturbation. It must be noted that there was nothing as graphic on Craigslist. This is relevant because Henry McMaster, South Carolina's attorney general, last week threatened Craigslist with a criminal investigation. McMaster hasn't made any similar threats--at least none that has been publicized--against Backpages. Managers at Backpages did not respond to an interview request. In November, Craigslist and 40 state attorneys general, including McMaster, signed an agreement that called for the site to add more safeguards. The classifieds publication followed through and one of the new changes was a new requirement that anyone posting to the erotic section must provide a credit card. All the parties hoped that criminals would be unwilling to provide identification and this would be deterrent. ""Many of the classified and communication services on the Craigslist site provide the public with a valuable service,"" McMaster wrote to Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster on May 5. ""However, it appears that the management...has knowingly allowed the site to be used for illegal and unlawful activity after warnings from law enforcement officials and after an agreement with forty state attorneys general."" Since then, Craigslist did away with the erotic section and agreed to review every ad before it appeared, but McMaster was dissatisfied. He posted a note on his site that said the ""Craigslist South Carolina site continues to display advertisements for prostitution and graphic pornographic material. This content was not removed as we requested. We have no alternative but to move forward with criminal investigation and potential prosecution."" This is at best an empty threat, says Matt Zimmerman, a senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The Communication Decency Act protects Web sites like Craigslist from being held criminally liable for the actions of its users, Zimmerman said, who added that Craigslist has no legal obligation to even review ads before they go online. Had Zimmerman had his way, Craigslist would have never agreed to do the monitoring. Craig Newmark, Craigslist's founder, had earlier gone on national TV and said that Craigslist would not do away with the erotic section. The company's reversal may have led McMaster to believe he could shame Craigslist managers into doing more than what the law required. ""It made life more difficult for Craigslist I think,"" Zimmerman said. ""But I was much more disappointed with (McMaster) than Craigslist,"" Zimmerman said. ""His threats were bogus to begin with and he was wrong to threaten (Craigslist's managers) with jail when the law is very clearly on their side."" © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- No one, especially not one of Mexico's top law enforcement officials, denies that killings by drug cartels have reached record levels. Mexican police carry a body after a clash with gangs that left 21 dead in the state of Chihuahua on February 10. But Monte Alejandro Rubido Garcia, executive secretary for the National System for Public Safety, has an explanation. ""Mexico all of a sudden stopped being a drug-transit country and became a drug-consuming country,"" Rubido told CNN on Thursday. That means gangs that once shipped drugs into the United States are now fighting each other to sell the drugs at home, he said. Their fights center on territory -- who gets to sell what and where. ""The only way to settle their differences is through violence,"" Rubido said. ""They're fighting block by block in a very violent way."" The result is a brutal onslaught that resulted in about 5,400 deaths last year, more than double the 2,477 tallied in 2007. Many analysts say Mexico is on track to set a record again this year. Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich called the situation in Mexico a ""civil war"" on a national TV program a few weeks ago. Larry Birns, director of the Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs, terms it ""a sickening vertigo into chaos and plunder."" The violence also is a result of the Mexican government's stepped-up fight against the drug cartels. President Felipe Calderon's administration has spent more money and confiscated more drugs than any previous one, Rubido said. ""Every time the state strikes a blow against them, their reaction is more violence,"" Rubido said of the drug cartels. A United Nations report released this week notes that the ""government of Mexico faces violent opposition by drug cartels to its attempts to fight organized crime and drug trafficking,"" adding that ""drug cartels have responded with unprecedented violence."" Much of this violence, Rubido said, is carried out in ""high-impact"" fashion, aiming to get attention and demoralize the cartels' enemies. For example, decapitations have become common. But decapitation often is not the cause of death. ""They're first killed with a shot, then decapitated for maximum visual impact,"" the law enforcement official said. ""They're trying to make the state go into reverse."" That will not happen, Rubido vowed. ""The only way to fight this is like we're doing in Mexico."" He listed three fronts in the conflict: a frontal assault on the gangs; prevention campaigns against drug use; and a common strategy and tactics among Mexico 1,660 police agencies. It's a tough battle, he admits, especially since the use of cocaine in Mexico has doubled in the past four years. Cocaine traffickers, Rubido said, have been looking for new markets and have targeted Europe and Mexico.  Watch how the violence is affecting the United States » . The U.N. report released this week notes that ""despite concrete measures adopted by the government, drug abuse remains high in Mexico, especially among school-age children and young people."" The war on drugs in Mexico is made even more difficult by rampant corruption, the report says. ""There is so much money involved in the drug trade, there is so much fear involved in the drug trade, that no institution can survive unaffected,"" said Birns. Says Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based policy center: ""This has really revealed just how corrupt Mexican officeholders are, how many people in key positions in the anti-drug war have been taking money from narcotraffickers."" In one recent instance, Noe Ramirez Mandujano, who was the nation's top anti-drug official from 2006 until August 2008, was arrested on charges that he accepted $450,000 a month in bribes from drug traffickers while in office. There have been other similar arrests of high-ranking officials for taking bribes from drug traffickers. ""There's no way the public treasury can pay what the drug traffickers are paying,"" Hakim said. Rubido acknowledges the situation. ""It is a problem, and it is assumed as fact,"" he said Thursday. But he also sees the arrest of high-ranking officials as proof that anti-corruption efforts are working. Drug lords have two ways to battle anti-crime efforts, he said: bribes and intimidation. That intimidation can often take brutal forms. Last weekend, for example, a police official in Tabasco state who had arrested a trafficker a week earlier was killed. So were his mother, his wife, his children and nieces and nephews. His brother, also a state police officer, was wounded, as were two others. In all, 12 people were shot dead in three homes. Six of them were children. A few days earlier, a retired army general was abducted, tortured and shot 11 times, less than 24 hours after becoming Cancun's top anti-drug official. He, his aide and a driver were all found dead in a truck by the side of a road. Cancun's police chief was arrested a few days later in connection with the slayings. Still, Rubido and others say, most of the deaths involve just drug traffickers, not ordinary citizens. ""Ninety percent of the people who died last year in organized crime were involved in crime,"" Rubido said. ""The problem is among criminal gangs."" Rubido sees the Mexican government prevailing. ""I have a firm conviction that it's a battle we will win,"" he said. Others are much less certain. ""The occasional anti-drug battle is being won, but the war is being lost,"" said Birns of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs public policy institute. ""And there's no prospect the war is going to be won."" That pessimism that the current strategy is working has led to calls for a new approach. Last week, the former presidents of Mexico, Colombia and Brazil called for the decriminalization of marijuana for personal use and a change in strategy on the war on drugs. Ex-presidents Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, Cesar Gaviria of Colombia and Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil made their announcement at a meeting in Brazil of the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy. ""The problem is that current policies are based on prejudices and fears and not on results,"" Gaviria said at a news conference in which the 17-member commission's recommendations were presented. Robert Pastor, a Latin America national security adviser for President Carter in the late 1970s, calls the problem in Mexico ""even worse than Chicago during the Prohibition era."" He said a solution similar to what ended that violence is needed now. ""What worked in the U.S. was not Eliot Ness,"" he said, referring to the federal agent famous for fighting gangsters in 1920s and '30s. ""It was the repeal of Prohibition."" Rubido is diplomatic, saying decriminalizing drugs is a ""terribly sensible"" approach that has received much thought. But he's not buying it. ""This has become a world of globalization,"" he said. ""Globalization has many virtues, but some errors. I can't conceive that one part of the world would decriminalize drugs because it would become a paradise for drug use. It might bring down violence, but there would be social damage.""","Official says drugs being used more inside Mexico, leading to turf wars .

"(CNN) -- Brazilian authorities detained the wife of former world boxing champion Arturo Gatti as a suspect in his killing, according to local reports. Arturo Gatti pictured during the final fight of his career, a knockout defeat by Alfonso Gomez in 2007. Gatti was found dead Saturday in a hotel in Brazil, where he was taking a vacation with his wife, Amanda Carina Barbosa Rodrigues, and their young child. The 37-year-old Canadian, who was born in Italy and made his name as a fighter based in New Jersey, was staying in the northeast seaside resort of Porto de Galihnas. Rodrigues, 23, was being held in a police station in the city of Recife in connection with the killing, a police official in Porto de Galihnas told CNN. Police official Osmar Silva Santiago confirmed local reports that Gatti's body was found Saturday morning in his hotel room with strangulation marks. ""This crime is being investigated by our homicide experts and we hope to have more answers tomorrow,"" Santiago said. Police recovered a blood-stained purse strap from the scene, according to media reports. Rodrigues became a suspect because of inconsistencies during her interrogation, local reports quoted homicide task force chief Josedith Ferreira as saying. Gatti made his name in a series of three fights against ""Irish"" Micky Ward, losing the first but triumphing in the other two. He held the IBF super-featherweight and WBC light-welterweight titles, and he also won the WBC junior welterweight belt but lost it to Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2005. Gatti retired in 2007 after suffering a knockout defeat by Alfonso Gomez in his comeback, ending with a record of 40 wins and nine losses. He grew up in Montreal, Quebec, after leaving Italy at an early age, and returned to the city following his retirement. According to Gatti's official Web site, the Italian-born pugilist won ""Fight of the Year"" for three consecutive years.

"During CNN's ""Going Green: Green Light for Business"" coverage, we've asked businesses to tell us how they balance the imperative for profit with environmental concerns. Jonathan Breeze, the CEO of Jet Republic, tells CNN how he's working to create a carbon neutral airline. LONDON, England -- The aviation industry is often perceived as one of the bad guys in the climate change debate. As a mode of transport, flying is regarded as being particularly polluting because of the amount of fuel used at high altitude. And, it is estimated to be responsible for around 3.5 percent of global greenhouse emissions. Jet Republic CEO Jonathan Breeze says it would be a mistake to let green initiatives in the airline industry fall by the wayside. The sector's reputation was damaged further when it was excluded from the targets outlined in the Kyoto agreement, which was interpreted by some as an example of its disregard for the climate change issue. This is unfair because the industry has taken great strides to reduce its environmental impact. For example, over the last 30 years, it has achieved a 60 percent improvement in fuel efficiency. There is a great deal of research being undertaken by manufacturers into more efficient technologies and alternative fuels, while the Single European Sky initiative aims to improve flight planning across Europe to rationalize the amount of time an aircraft is in the sky. Practically everything we do in our everyday lives has a carbon cost attached to it, but aviation is an element that we believe has come in for an undue level of criticism, when in fact it is arguably working harder than most industries to address the issue of climate change. The reaction to this criticism from governments has been taxation. But making a special case of aviation fails to address the wider issues. Aviation fuel is carbon taxed, but why is this tax not applied on other types of fuel such as electricity and gas? The additional revenue that would be generated could be ploughed back into green energy schemes and help deliver heightened efficiencies that our industry is already investigating. Punitive taxation, which is driving up the cost of air travel, will ultimately end up being absorbed by the operator or by passengers. This, coupled with the current economic downturn, represents a significant threat to progress in the aviation industry as it could lead to a stifling of innovation and development. Meeting the challenge of climate change costs money -- modernizing fleets with more efficient aircraft comes at a price. As an industry which has been hit hard by the downturn, some of these initiatives could fall by the wayside. To allow this to happen would be a grave mistake. We identified climate change as one area where we wanted to set the standard in the industry, and as a new entrant to the market we have been able to build a commitment to carbon neutrality into the heart of our business operations. It was a consideration in our choice of the Learjet 60 XR as the model of aircraft in our 110 strong fleet. The 60 XR is the most fuel-efficient midsize aircraft in the world, something it achieves by being built with light and strong modern materials, and flying higher and faster than other aircraft. It's a perfect example of a win-win solution. We burn less fuel; our customers enjoy lower pricing. Aircraft positioning is another important consideration that has an impact on the amount of fuel consumed; our fleet is based all across Europe, to reflect where our clients are. The positions of our aircraft are carefully planned and managed so that the number of ""over flights"" -- that is legs where the aircraft is empty -- are kept to an absolute minimum. We wanted to be 100 percent carbon neutral from launch so we partnered with ClimateCare, one of Europe's most experienced providers of carbon offsets, where each project is rigorously audited and monitored for quality. By comparison, under the European emissions trading scheme, which doesn't take effect until 2012, commercial airlines will only have to offset 15 percent of the carbon emissions they create. With the impact of aviation on climate change being widely reported, people are more conscious than ever about their carbon footprint when using air travel. While the overwhelming majority have not changed the amount they travel because of it, it is certainly becoming a more important consideration and people are asking more questions before traveling. We have found that our attitude towards mitigating the effect our business has on the environment has actually become a business benefit. Our competitive pricing structure includes a carbon offset charge, which is passed on, in its entirety, to ClimateCare. By acknowledging our responsibilities in the area of climate control and putting tangible measures in place, we have received considerable positive feedback from clients and business partners. We believe that Jet Republic is at the forefront of modern European business. If every company in Europe could run 100 percent carbon neutral, as Jet Republic does, the world would be a better place.","Jet Republic has teamed up with ClimateCare to become carbon neutral .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Police arrested 26 demonstrators at the U.S. Capitol on Thursday during a protest of federal AIDS policy, a Capitol police spokeswoman said. A man is placed in a van Thursday after being arrested on suspicion of unlawfully demonstrating in the Capitol. Police arrested the protesters on suspicion of unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct at the Capitol rotunda, spokeswoman Sgt. Kimberly Schneider said. The protesting group, Health Global Access Project, said in a statement that 27 people were arrested. The 10 a.m. demonstration by dozens of AIDS activists for increased funding of AIDS programs coincides with this week's congressional talks over the financing of a health care reform plan. Members of Health Global Access Project entered the busy rotunda and chained themselves together with plastic chains, Schneider said. They lay on the ground holding up signs while some amused bystanders watched as police tried to persuade the protesters to disperse. Police took those who refused into custody. Group members knew they risked arrest, the group said in its statement, but they wanted to grab the attention of lawmakers and President Obama, who they accused of creating a ""flawed budget proposal"" that did not include critical HIV/AIDS funding. ""HIV is not in recession,"" Omolola Adele-Oso of DC Fights Back said in the statement. ""So why are we bailing out the bankers with $9 trillion, but breaking promises to fund life-saving AIDS programs in the U.S. and around the world at a fraction of that cost?"" The group wants increased HIV/AIDS funding in the health care plan and requested that the government ""fully fund"" global AIDS programs and housing programs for low-income AIDS sufferers, they said. They argue that the administration's budget proposal ""essentially flatlines global AIDS funding."" HIV/AIDS funding increased for 2010 under a Department of Health and Human Services budget. Obama applauded former President Bush in December for his funding of global AIDS programs and said he planned to continue the work for AIDS relief in Africa. About 33 million people worldwide have HIV, according to the World Health Organization. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 1.1 million people living in the United States are infected with HIV/AIDS. More than 13 percent of those newly diagnosed in 2006 transmitted the disease through injection drug use, the CDC reported. Health Global Access Project also wants Congress to lift the federal ban on funding syringe exchange so clean needles are available to users, Jose De Marco said in the statement. De Marco, who has HIV, is a member of the AIDS activist organizations ACT UP Philadelphia and Proyecto Sol Filadelphia.","Police: Demonstrators chained themselves together, lay on ground in rotunda .

Official merchandise from Michael Jackson's ""This Is It"" tour is for sale, according to the shows' promoter. The e-mail, which went to people with tickets to London tour dates that were to start in July, reaffirmed an earlier announcement that ticketholders will receive a full refund or, if they chose, a commemorative ticket for the tour. The concert merchandise includes Jackson belt buckles, socks, hats, wallets, music and a myriad of T-shirts. ""Early in June, Michael Jackson approved a line of official merchandise for you, his fans,"" said the e-mail from concert promoter AEG Live. ""As we mourn the loss of one of the greatest talents the world has ever seen, we are only beginning to feel the impact that Michael left upon us all.

Fifty sold-out Jackson concerts were scheduled for the O2 Arena in London, starting July 13. The shows were billed as the final concerts of his career and were called ""This Is It."" Jackson was expected to earn $50 million from the London shows. The singer died with debts estimated at $500 million, and his estate will take years to unravel legally. On Wednesday, Paul McCartney refuted media accounts about the fate of the Beatles song catalog, which Jackson co-owned.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama will deliver a speech June 4 in Egypt on America's relationship with the Muslim world, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs announced Friday. President Obama will travel to Egypt next month to address U.S. relations with the Muslim world. Egypt is ""a country that in many ways represents the heart of the Arab world,"" Gibbs said. He deflected several questions at his daily briefing about whether Egypt is a wise choice, given President Hosni Mubarak's resistance to making his government more democratic. Obama originally promised to deliver the speech during his first 100 days, but senior administration officials say the date slipped in part because of security and logistical issues. The officials stressed, however, that the Secret Service still has deep security concerns, given the continued tumult in the Mideast. Obama chose Turkey, a more secular state, as the site of his first presidential speech to a Muslim majority nation, on April 6. He told the Turkish legislature in Ankara that the ""United States is not and will never be at war with Islam."" Obama will follow his visit to Egypt with a trip to the remains of the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany on June 5. He is then scheduled to take part in ceremonies commemorating the 65th anniversary of the World War II Allied landings in Normandy, France.

"(CNN) -- A South Florida teenager accused of killing and mutilating 19 cats excitedly described to police how he dissected cats in class, and where to find cats for experimentation, according to police. Tyler Weinman laughed when police told him they had information he was the cat killer, an arrest document said. When Miami-Dade police told Tyler Hayes Weinman someone was killing cats in the neighborhood, the 18-year-old reacted by laughing, according to a newly released arrest affidavit made public Monday. Most of the cats were found in their owners' yards. ""One appeared to be posed with a slit down the middle of its stomach,"" the affidavit states. On Monday, Weinman pleaded not guilty to more than 40 criminal counts, including multiple charges of felony animal cruelty and burglary. He is out of jail on $249,500 bond and under house arrest wearing an electronic monitor, but is being held for 48 hours for a psychiatric evaluation. The teen's attorney David Macey said there was a ""lynch mob"" after his innocent client and accused Judge Mindy Glazer of ""prejudging"" Weinman. ""He did not kill the cats,"" Macey told reporters outside the courtroom. ""The individual who committed this crime is still running around out there."" The arrest affidavit, which a judge gave prosecutors until Monday to make public, reads like a grisly horror movie and indicates Weinman was knowledgeable of and fascinated with dissection of cats. During questioning, according to the affidavit, a detective told the teenager that police were informed he was involved in the cat slayings. Weinman replied he heard about the cats and that he told his mother. He told police that a school he had been expelled from was the only school in Miami-Dade that taught how to dissect using cats, according to the affidavit. The teenager went on to offer several other bizarre and unsubstantiated trivia, including saying that Mexico is the only source for cats used for dissection and describing their size. Weinman ""became excited and animated"" as he told the detective about cat dissection research he had discovered on the Internet, the affidavit states. ""Weinman was asked to expound on what he meant and he repeated, with noted excitement, 'It just makes a certain sound, a tearing sound,"" says the affidavit. The detective asked Weinman what tools might be used to commit animal cruelty, and teenager replied, ""I don't know, but I'm sure they are very well hidden."" How did he think the cats were being captured? The teen answered, ""They have to be either tranquilized or poisoned."" Weinman came to the attention of authorities in late April, the affidavit states, as cats began to go missing in a suburban Dade County neighborhood called Whispering Pines just outside Miami, Florida. Police had a few times seen Weinman walking and skateboarding in the middle of the night in the area, at least once wearing black clothing and carrying a dark backpack. Detectives stopped the teenager and told him about the dead cats. Weinman responded by laughing, according to the arrest affidavit. He was not held at that time. In May, the teenager was pulled over for a traffic violation and police found a ""cutting instrument"" on the ground beside his car. According to the affidavit, as an officer questioned the teen, he noticed what appeared to be a cat scratch on his arm. ""I got them from a stray cat that I feed at my mom's house,"" Weinman said. The teen ""was eager to show"" the scratches and took off his shirt so that photographs could be taken, according to the questioning detective's account, which is detailed in the affidavit. The teenager's divorced parents lived in separate neighborhoods, according to police. His mother resides in Cutler Bay. His father lives in Palmetto Bay, further north of Miami. According to the arrest affidavit, shortly after the teenager talked to police about dissecting cats, he went to live with his father who restricted his son's access to a car. The killings shifted north as eight dead cats turned up in Palmetto Bay, police said. At that point, police provided the teen's profile to the Miami-Dade Police Department's Psychological Services Section. Staff doctors met and discussed the case. They determined that the cat killer was likely male and suffered from some kind of conduct disorder. If the killer was an adult, they concluded, that person would be classified as a sociopath. In late May, police then got a court order to place a tracking device on the Honda Civic driven by Weinman. The affidavit states the car was tracked to the latest feline victim which had been skinned along the abdomen from the pelvic area to the hind legs. The pelt and genitalia were missing. The cat killings became headline news across the country. Around that time, Weinman joined a Facebook page called ""Catch-The-Cat-Killer."" The teenager is charged with 19 counts of felony animal cruelty, 19 counts of improperly disposing of an animal body and four counts of burglary. He's pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. Kimberly Segal contributed to this report.","Police: Tyler Weinman described research he did on finding cats to dissect .

"WINNER, South Dakota (CNN) -- Neal Wanless, a down-on-his luck cowboy before winning a $232 million Powerball jackpot last month, was always known for his big heart even when he barely had a dime to his name. Neal Wanless, winner of the $232 million lottery in South Dakota, shown here in a high school yearbook. Now, with his good fortune, neighbors and former teachers worry that he might be easily separated from his new-found money, although he doesn't seem to be around to give any of it away. ""I just hope he doesn't get inundated,"" his former English teacher Deana Brodkorb told CNN. ""He's just such a nice guy and I hope he doesn't get suckered."" Flip through the yearbook at Todd County High School and the portrait emerges of the ""good kid"" that teachers and classmates remember. Wanless ran cross-country, played in the band and graduated second in his class -- the 2004 Salutatorian. Diane Linster, his math teacher, remembers Wanless coming early to school and staying late to pump up his grades. ""Just a very humble, kind and considerate kid,"" Linster said.  Watch friends and neighbors describe the lucky cowboy » . Chris Leneaugh, once an assistant cross-county coach, remembers a dedication to running that propelled Wanless from the middle of the pack to near the front of the team by his senior year. ""Neal never gave up trying,"" Leneaugh said. ""That's what I liked about him, his dedication."" The yearbook also tells the tale of a hat-wearing rancher who was one of a few white students in a school filled with Native Americans -- Lakota Sioux from the Rosebud Indian Reservation. ""Oh man, he was always cowboyed up,"" said former classmate Mike Prue. ""We are all Natives around here and there he was with his Wrangler shirt and jeans. He really stuck out."" Prue and his buddy Steve Plank said Wanless would help them with their homework, despite the differences. The story of the Wanless family is the story of a family doing muscle-aching work just to scratch out a living. It's the story of a family that needed a break. Wanless and his parents had recently moved into a camper on their ranch, after losing their home to foreclosure, according to neighbor Erv Figert. A sign with chipped off green lettering sits in the grass at the entrance to the Wanless property. ""There was a sign out there that said 'the ranch that God built,' "" said Joe Prue, father of Mike Prue. ""And for a while there you thought, where was God when everything was coming apart. And now, maybe God helped them."" Neighbors say they have not seen anyone come or go from the Wanless Ranch after Neal briefly emerged at a press conference last week to accept a giant-sized check from the May 27 drawing. For now, the gate to the Wanless ranch is held tight by a new lock, linking a rusted-brown chain. Rumors travel through the green fields of South Dakota faster than the Internet. Talk is cheap with millions of dollars to loosen the tongues. Many believe the Wanless family is going to buy a place up north, maybe by Pierre, but the cowboy with the big heart isn't talking. ""That grin you saw on his face on television (when Wanless accepted the check) is always there,"" said Linster. ""He always looked like he was probably up to something."" Now he has the money to do something about it.","Neal Wanless from South Dakota won $232 million in lottery .

"(CNN) -- She's been a comedian, talk-show host and feared red carpet fashion critic. Now you can add winner of ""The Celebrity Apprentice"" to Joan Rivers' lengthy resume. Donald Trump and Joan Rivers attend ""The Celebrity Apprentice"" season finale Sunday in New York. After weeks of competition, the 75-year-old dynamo beat out 15 other contestants, including Dennis Rodman, Tom Green and Brian McKnight, to take the top spot in this season's edition of the reality show hosted by Donald Trump. Rivers went up against poker champion Annie Duke in Sunday night's finale in which both women were charged with planning a VIP party and silent auction for the last and deciding task. ""They're both tough, they're both smart and they both hate each other,"" Trump observed at the beginning of the show. The apparent tension between Rivers and Duke continued in the final boardroom, part of which played out in front of a live audience, with both finalists bickering and interrupting each other repeatedly as Trump looked on. In the end, Duke raised far more money at her event, but Rivers was able to attract more celebrities and provide a better overall experience for the guests at her party, and Trump declared her the winner of the competition. ""Your level of energy has been amazing,"" he told Rivers. The victory means $250,000 for Rivers' charity: God's Love We Deliver. If the series thrives on conflict, it got plenty of mileage out of Rivers. She blew up at country singer Clint Black, referred to another contestant as a ""stupid blonde"" and smashed a champagne glass out of frustration at one point. But Rivers seemed to be especially infuriated by Duke, calling her a ""despicable human being"" -- the tamest of the insults she hurled in Duke's direction over the course of the series. Rivers even walked out in a huff after her daughter, and fellow contestant, Melissa was fired from the show. The exit, complete with bleeped obscenities, was turned into a cliffhanger of sorts when it seemed like Rivers might not come back, but she returned to the show for the next task. You might think a show that's best known for the phrase ""You're fired"" might not do so well in a bad economy when thousands of people have heard similar words for real at their workplaces, but the series averaged more than 8 million viewers a week, according to Entertainment Weekly. EW: Did the right one win? Revived formula . ""The Apprentice"" made a splash when it debuted in 2004, making a reality television star out of Trump and contestants such as Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth. For several seasons, the series took ambitious young mogul wannabes, divided them into teams and had them compete in tasks that ranged from selling lemonade to creating advertising campaigns for major corporations. The contestants vied for the chance to run one of Trump's companies for a year, and Trump fired someone from the losing team each week until he selected an apprentice. Over the years, ratings for the show gradually declined, but the formula was revived in early 2008 with the first season of ""The Celebrity Apprentice."" The tasks, pressure-cooker atmosphere and boardroom bickering stayed the same, but the competition now featured contestants with varying degrees of fame and focused on raising money for charity. The first ""Celebrity Apprentice"" top spot went to Piers Morgan, the prickly judge on ""Britain's Got Talent"" who made news this spring when he invited singing sensation Susan Boyle to dinner after her memorable performance on the show. Morgan also made several appearances on this season's ""Apprentice,"" sitting in as Trump's ""eyes and ears"" during one episode and interviewing the final four candidates in another. Morgan's aggressive questioning seemed to annoy the celebrities, especially Jesse James, who glared icily at Morgan when he kept asking him why he did not turn to his wife, Sandra Bullock, for help in raising money during the various tasks. Perhaps Bullock might be tempted to try competing on the show herself. NBC announced last month it is bringing back ""The Celebrity Apprentice"" for another installment in the spring of 2010, Entertainment Weekly reported.","Joan Rivers wins this season's ""Celebrity Apprentice""

""I love when I get nervous. When I really get nervous -- and I'm nervous about this record -- it means that it's beyond what I thought it was going to be."" Having just completed a European tour, Richie said a North American jaunt is on the drawing board in the next year. ""We are going to tour ... in fine fashion,"" he said. ""We're going to give them everything they ever wanted."" Richie spoke to CNN about avoiding rap, keeping up with the club scene and what gives him chills. CNN: You've always been very diligent about updating your sound. So how do you describe Lionel Richie's sound in 2009? Lionel Richie: It's all in production. You have to first of all feel it. I have to feel it. If I don't feel it, then forget the song. I'm a storyteller, not so much a singer, but a storyteller. So when it comes down to production, we just updated the production. But Akon and Ne-Yo and all these guys ... what do we all have in common? Melody. As long as they don't rap and ask me to rap we have show business. CNN: Have you ever rapped before? Richie: I rapped a couple of times. And it was clear to me, it was told to me from some of the greatest rappers in the world, ""Don't even think about it."" Flavor Flav ... years ago I went to him and I said ""You know I'm thinking about doing some rap on my album. What do you think?"" And he said ""Are you out of your mind?"" He said, ""The only reason I'm rapping is because I can't sing."" And that's the clear channel of where I need to be going. CNN: Right. Just do what you're good at. Richie: Do what I do and don't get away from it. CNN: How much time do you spend doing research in nightclubs? Richie: Now try to explain that to your girlfriend or to your wife! Where are you tonight? I'm doing research! As much time as I can. You have to be in it to see what people are moving to and what turns them on. It's all in beats and rhythms and in lyric content. You can send somebody down to do some study for you. But the bottom line is there's nothing like going in yourself in the middle of a club in London, or in the middle of a club in Australia or a club in the middle of Germany somewhere. Just sit over in the corner and watch what people dance to. By the time I leave France, England, Germany, Italy, America, I can go home and write the most incredible album in the world because I know what the world beat is. I know where everything's going. CNN: You turn 60 very soon. Richie: I cannot believe the number, but yes I do.  Watch Richie say ""hello"" to getting older » . CNN: How do you feel about that? Richie: You know, I don't feel anything except better than anything before. My life is better now than it has ever been ever. So maybe all night long may not be all night long, but it's pretty darn good. CNN: How long are you going to keep churning out records? Richie: I like doing this. I don't like fishing, so this was my hobby when I started. This is how I got into the business when I started because it was a place to go to get away from everything. So I still love doing it. CNN: Looking at all your past hits, what song gives you the most chills to perform? Richie: Wow. That's so tough. [It's] between ""Hello"" and ""Still."" What happens is I look at people in the audience and I kind of know where they are. I know that there's so much depth in their thoughts. Those songs touch the core of whatever it is their lives were about. If there was ever a song about love, or in ""Still,"" something you lost, you could see it in their faces that they're trying to remember every detail of the experience or the person they were with.","Lionel Richie, who shot to mega-stardom in the 1980s, has a new album .

"DECATUR, Georgia (CNN) -- One falling tree saved John Kiefer from another. Windstorms in Atlanta, Georgia, uprooted several trees, including this one that fell through John Kiefer's home. Kiefer was sitting on his sofa Monday morning while a brief but intense windstorm blew through the Atlanta, Georgia, area, including Decatur. He heard a tree crash in his backyard and got up to investigate. That tree knocked down a chain-link fence, and Kiefer was getting worried about several other large backyard trees that were swaying in the wind. ""And as I'm watching those move and sway, this crashed down,"" he said. ""This"" was a 50-foot red oak in the front yard that fell onto his living room, splitting his house in half and coming to rest a few inches above where he had been sitting on the couch. ""Yeah, it's a mess,"" he said as he surveyed the tangle of broken wood beams, plaster, bricks and gray insulation. Curiously, Kiefer's electricity was still on, and cable TV was still playing less then 10 feet away from the massive tree trunk in his living room. An ancient upright piano and various collectibles on it were unharmed. Kiefer had been away over the weekend, visiting a son in Cincinnati, Ohio, and his three dogs were still at the kennel where he boarded them. They'll be staying there a bit longer. Three years of drought in Georgia have weakened trees' root systems, and recent heavy rains loosened the soil around them, said Kiefer, who works at a plastics recycling company in nearby Stone Mountain. The windstorm brought down hundreds of trees in the area, including one that crushed a car, killing the person inside, and one that fell on a nursing home, where no one was hurt, CNN affiliate WGCL reported. Service was disrupted on Atlanta's MARTA rail transit system, according to WGCL. Power and traffic signals were out in many areas.  Watch CNN report about dangerous storms » . Despite having a tree lying across his living room, Kiefer seemed remarkably calm, but that was a new development. ""Couple of hours ago my knees where shaking pretty good,"" he admitted. But, he said, God was looking out for him. ""Actually, he saved my life,"" Kiefer said. ""When I came outside to investigate that noise, that was my warning to get up off that couch. And then, not to go back in the house when it got real windy, but to stand right there where that tree stopped. There are no coincidences.""","Brief but intense windstorm blows through Atlanta, Georgia .

"(CNN)  -- A suburban Philadelphia swim club has invited children from a largely minority day-care center to come back after a June reversal that fueled allegations of racism against the club, a spokeswoman said Sunday. Some kids from the Creative Steps Day Care center say club members made racial remarks. The development came during a hastily called Sunday afternoon meeting of the Valley Club in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. Club members voted overwhelmingly to try to work things out with the day-care center, which accused some swim club members of making racist comments to black and Hispanic children contracted to use the pool, said Bernice Duesler, the club director's wife. Duesler said the club canceled its contract with the Creative Steps day-care because of safety, crowding and noise concerns, not racism. ""As long as we can work out safety issues, we'd like to have them back,"" she told CNN. She said the club has been subpoenaed by the state Human Rights Commission, which has begun a fact-finding investigation, ""and the legal advice was to try to get together with these camps, "" Duesler added. Alethea Wright, Creative Steps' director, said, ""They should have done that before."" Wright has repeatedly lambasted the club for its tepid response to the charges and said the children in her care were ""emotionally damaged"" by the incident. ""These children are scarred. How can I take those children back there?"" she said. However, Wright's lawyer, Carolyn Nicholas, said the center will give the Valley Club's offer ""due consideration"" once it is received and looks forward to sitting down with the parties. ""The children are our primary concern,"" Nicholas told CNN. Swimming privileges for about 65 children from Creative Steps were revoked after their first visit June 29. Some children said white members of the club made racist comments to the children, asking why ""black children were there"" and raising concerns that ""they might steal from us."" Days later, the day-care center's $1,950 check was returned, Wright said. Club director John Duesler told CNN that he had underestimated the amount of children who would participate, and the club was unable to supervise that many kids. He called his club ""very diverse,"" and said it had offered to let day camps in the Philadelphia area use his facility after budget cuts forced some pools in the area to close. Wright has rejected the camp's contention that the swim club's pool was overcrowded. The club had accepted a 10-to-1 ratio of children to adults and was considering adding up to three lifeguards, according to e-mails obtained by CNN. But John Duesler said last week that the Valley Club also canceled contracts with two other day-care centers because of safety and overcrowding issues. The Pennsylvania Human Rights Commission launched an investigation last week after allegations of racism at the Valley Club. The commission said that as part of any investigation, the two sides eventually could be asked to sit down face-to-face with its investigators. ""We always encourage opposing parties to communicate with one another if they feel they can resolve these issues amicably,"" Commission Chairman Stephen Glassman said. Bernice Duesler said she wasn't yet sure how the club will ""reach out"" to Creative Steps and the other two camps. And Wright said she still has concerns about the issue. ""Are the members who made those comments still there?"" she asked.","Suburban Philadelphia club invites kids at largely minority day care to come back .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Former world number one, Pete Sampras, has described recently crowned French Open champion Roger Federer as the best player in history. Roger Federer after equalling Pete Sampras's record of winning 14 men's singles titles. The 37-year-old American, nicknamed 'Pistol Pete' for his bullet-like serves, won a record 14 grand slam men's singles titles over a 15-year career, though never captured the trophy at Roland Garros. In beating Sweden's Robin Soderling 6-1, 7-6, 6-4 to take the French title on Sunday, Federer equaled Sampras's record and became only the sixth man in history to win each of the four majors. Debate: Is Federer the greatest player ever? The feat marks the 27-year-old Swiss out as the finest player to ever grace the game according to Sampras: ""What he's done over the past five years has never, ever been done -- and probably will never, ever happen again. ""Regardless if he won there or not, he goes down as the greatest ever. This just confirms it,"" Sampras told the Guardian newspaper. ""I'm obviously happy for Roger. If there's anyone that deserves it, it's Roger. He's come so close (previously),"" Sampras said of the new champion and world number two, who lost the last three consecutive French Open finals to Spain's Rafael Nadal. Federer  spoke exclusively to CNN after his win and said he was relieved to have bounced back after relinquishing the world number one slot and the Australian and Wimbledon titles to Nadal in 2008. ""It's been a fantastic day - to get the elusive French title in the end was unbelievable. I always believed I was good enough  to get it - but holding the trophy, after all I've been through was just unbelievable.  I'm so proud right now you can't believe it. ""For me there was never a question whether I was going to retire.  I worked extremely hard in the off season.  Losing semifinals and finals all of a sudden wasn't good enough for people anymore. But this victory is timely because I've proved many people wrong."" The historic nature of the victory was also not lost on Federer: ""The records mean a lot to me especially after the last few years when I realized that I was (up there) with the greatest players of all time. Of course I like to break records - because I look up to people like Sampras, Agassi, Connors and McEnrore, it's so great to be up there with those players."" However, in an ominous warning to his rivals, the champion already said he had eyes on his next conquest: ""I still feel like I have much more left in me - I'm only 27 years-old and I'd like to play for many more years to come and I hope I reach many more titles."" Federer's vanquished opponent in the final, Soderling also praised his conquerer: ""For me he is the best ever and I should know as I've player him many times,"" the world-ranked number 12 told CNN. Next up for Federer is the third grand slam of 2009, Wimbledon, where he will aim to go one better than Bjorn Borg by winning the tournament six times when the event starts on June 22. Federer's historic weekend win was recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Jacques Rogge who also tagged the Swiss simply the best that tennis has seen. ""Today I wrote to Roger Federer to congratulate him on this unique success because I consider him to be the best player of all time,"" Rogge told a media briefing in Brussels on Monday. The IOC supremo revealed that in the letter he had expressed the hope that Federer would take part in the 2012 Olympic Games in London. Federer added an Olympic gold to his collection of tennis accolades by winning the men's doubles with compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka in Beijing last year.","Former world number one Pete Sampras says Federer is the 'greatest'

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- It was the annual revving of the engines Sunday at the Lincoln Memorial as thousands of motorcyclists converged on Washington to honor those who have served the country. Members of Rolling Thunder ride into Washington on Sunday. Riders from Rolling Thunder, a group created to bring attention to soldiers listed as POW or MIA, rolled into the nation's capital, greeting crowds of supporters who lined the streets. ""It's a great tribute to people that have sacrificed everything, including their life,"" said rider Mick Smith. He and fellow Vietnam veteran Juan Cruz rode their motorcycles from Pennsylvania. ""It's a brotherhood that we have, veterans of the foreign wars,"" Cruz said. ""The camaraderie is so perfect that we don't need anything else. We forget about our problems."" Lyn Seidler was among the spectators who lined the motorcycle route in the hot and humid weather to greet the bikers as they passed over the Arlington Memorial Bridge into Washington. ""The servicemen made a sacrifice,"" Seidler said. For her, cheering on Rolling Thunder was a way to help celebrate troops, ""and to say thank you,"" she said.

"MARDAN, Pakistan (CNN)  -- A family of 18 Pakistani men, women and children trudges down a dirt road toward a refugee camp. These children are among the thousands of refugees this week at the Jalozai camp in western Pakistan. Adolescent girls carry infants on their hips, while the men lug bundles of belongings on their backs. ""Come, stay close to me,"" said one woman wrapped in brightly colored robes, speaking to three children trailing behind her. ""This one is empty,"" a white-bearded Pakistani police officer tells the family, pointing toward a tent. The women and children scramble under the canvas flap, as Salar Khan explains what led his family to flee to Mardan. ""Mortars destroyed three houses in my village,"" he said. ""It was dangerous. A piece of shrapnel almost pierced my child's leg."" Khan said his family left their home Wednesday morning in Sultanwas, a town in Buner district. Now, they are living in Mardan's rapidly growing tent city of more than 1,400 other displaced Pakistanis. Five days ago, it was an empty field.  Watch as CNN's Ivan Watson tours a refugee camp » . Khan's family has joined tens of thousands of other Pakistanis fleeing south to escape the escalating conflict between the military and Taliban militants in northwestern Pakistan. Meanwhile, columns of Pakistani troops in military trucks head in the opposite direction, hauling field guns north toward the conflict zone. Pakistani families have fled the area any way they can: on foot, by hitching rides on the back of trucks and by stowing their belongings on the roofs of cars. As fighting has spread from the districts of Buner and Lower Dir to the Taliban stronghold in the Swat Valley, camps for displaced people are cropping up across northwest Pakistan. The United Nations said the new exodus is exacerbating an already existing humanitarian crisis. Since August, the U.N. has registered more than 500,000 Pakistanis forced to flee their homes by fighting in other northwestern parts of the country. ""Last year ... 4 million people worldwide lost their homes, out of which you have half a million displaced in Pakistan,"" said Manuel Bessler, a top U.N. official in Islamabad. Bessler spoke on a rooftop, overlooking the sprawling Jalozai refugee camp in western Pakistan. Until recently, the camp housed refugees from neighboring Afghanistan. The Afghans are now gone, replaced by more then 49,000 Pakistanis. Administrators are preparing space for 35,000 others. With help from U.N. agencies, the Pakistani government and other aid organizations, residents get access to medical care, children's schools and training programs to teach them how to rebuild their damaged homes if and when they get to return. Tensions have been building in the Jalozai camp. Two months ago, Pakistani police shot and killed one demonstrator after residents protested, blocking roads, throwing stones and demanding compensation for homes damaged by the fighting. This week, a crowd of several hundred agitated men gathered at the entrance, angry about a delay of several days in the monthly distribution of food aid. Some accused camp administrators of corruption, allegations that aid workers have denied. ""The wheat we've been given is substandard, and people are getting sick instead of being fed,"" said one man named Gulzada. ""Our houses have been destroyed,"" said another man called Anwar. ""There's no tea, no sugar, no wheat, no lentils. All that we have are the clothes we are wearing."" A fresh wave of displaced Pakistanis will only aggravate tensions, said Bessler, the U.N. official. ""This is a factor that is destabilizing not only in the camp but in the country as a whole,"" he warned. Only a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of displaced Pakistanis are ending up in camps. Many more have settled with host families or have resorted to paying rent in other cities. The influx of ethnic Pashtuns from northwest Pakistan upset the delicate demographic balance last month in the port city of Karachi. That led to ethnic clashes between Pashtuns and the resident Muhajir community, resulting in the deaths of more than 30 people. Many more Pakistanis are unable to leave the conflict area, according to Sebastian Brack, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Islamabad. ""There is a serious humanitarian crisis under way,"" Brack said. ""There is serious fighting going on. There will be massive displacement. Because of the curfew, [many] have not been able to leave yet."" In this moment of crisis, some homeless Pakistanis are turning to a higher power. ""Whenever it is God's will, we will go back to our homes,"" says Mohammed Munir, an elderly man who fled with his family from the Buner district to the new camp in Mardan three days ago. ""And we pray to Allah that he will protect us. It's up to Allah. We can't do anything."" The man kneeled and prayed in the grass outside the entrance of a tent that his family now calls home.","Tens of thousands flee south to escape conflict between military and Taliban .

"Editor's note: Below is an excerpt from Larry King's autobiography, ""My Remarkable Journey,"" published by Weinstein Books and available at bookstores nationwide.  Larry King anchors ""Larry King Live at 9 p.m. ET on CNN. Larry King recalls a much-needed win at the track during one of the lowest points of his life. I was thirty-seven years old. (In 1971). I had no job. I had a couple hundred thousand dollars in debts. And a four-year-old daughter. I'd take Chaia to our secret park on our visiting days. That's when the pain cut the deepest -- looking at my daughter and knowing I had no way to support her. Things got bleaker and bleaker. I became a recluse. By late May, I was down to forty-two dollars. My rent was paid only until the end of the month. I locked myself in my apartment wondering how bad things could possibly get. Pretty soon I wouldn't even be able to afford cigarettes. I remembered a night when I was a young man in New York, alone, cold, and without cigarettes or the money to buy them -- I had smashed open a vending machine to get a pack. A friend called up and told me to start living like a human being again. He invited me to the track. I had nothing better to do, and I figured it would be good therapy to get out and have lunch with a friend and watch the horses come down the stretch. I'll never forget that day. I put on a Pierre Cardin jeans outfit that had no pockets and drove to Calder Race Course. I can still see the horses warming up before the third race. There was a horse called Lady Forli -- a filly running against males. Normally, female horses don't beat males. We're talking cheap horses. I scanned the board and saw that she was 70-1. But my eyes really opened when I looked at the racing form. Racetrack people talk to each other. So I turned to the guy next to me and said, ""You know, this horse, three races back, won in more or less the same company. Why is she 70-1?"" ""Well,"" the guy said, ""there's a couple of new horses here."" ""Yeah, but she should be, like, 20-1. Not 70--1."" Screw it. I bet ten dollars on the horse to win. But I kept looking at the horse. The more I looked at this horse, the more I liked it. So I bet exactas. I bet Lady Forli on top of every other horse and below every other horse. Now I had what's called a wheel. Larry King's life in pictures » . I kept looking at the horse. Wait a minute, I told myself, I've got four dollars left. I have a pack of cigarettes. I've gotta give the valet two bucks. That still leaves me with money to bet a trifecta. My birthday is November 19. Lady Forli was number 11. So I bet 11 to win, 1 to place, and 9 to show. Now I had bets in for 11 on top, 11 on bottom, and 11 to win. And I had a trifecta -- 11-1-9. When the race began, I had two dollars left to my name -- and that was for the valet. They broke out of the gate. The 1 broke on top, the 9 ran second, and the 11 came out third. The 11 passed the 9, passed the 1, and they ran in a straight line all around the track. There was no question about it. The 11 won by five lengths. The 1 was three lengths ahead of the 9. I had every winning ticket. I had it to win. I had the exacta. I had the trifecta. I collected nearly eight thousand dollars. Eight thousand dollars! It had to be one of the happiest moments of my life -- certainly the most exciting. But I had no pockets. So I stuffed all the money in my jacket. It was bundled up. I didn't know what to do with it. I ran out of the track. The valet attendant came over and said, ""You leaving so early?"" ""Yeah."" ""Bad day, Mr. King?"" I tipped him fifty dollars. The guy nearly fainted. I had to go somewhere, to stop and make sure it was real. I drove to a vacant lot, which is now called Dolphin Stadium. I parked among the weeds and opened up my jacket. All the money spilled out. I counted out about seventy-nine hundred dollars. I paid my child support for the next year. I paid my rent for a year. I bought twenty cartons of cigarettes and stacked them up in my apartment, and I filled the refrigerator. Up to that point, that may have been the happiest moment of my life. Now, today, if I go to the track and win $8,000, it's very nice, but it won't affect my life one iota. It's nice to win. But when you really need it ...","At age 37, Larry King had $42 to his name, no job and a daughter to support .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Hundreds of Michael Jackson fans gathered in London on Monday to pay tribute to the tragic pop star on the night when he was supposed to be opening his 50-night residency in the city. Fans scrawl messages to the star on a wall outside the London venue where he would have been playing. The O2 arena in southeast London, where Jackson's ""This is It"" shows were due to be staged, had been the site of an unofficial shrine to the performer since his death last month. On Monday fans laid flowers and memorabilia, wrote messages to the star on a wall and sang Jackson songs. At 7 p.m. (2 p.m. ET) many of the crowd joined hands and sang the Jackson-penned ""We Are the World,"" and chanted ""Michael! King of Pop."" Many present had bought tickets for the opening night but had decided to come anyway. ""I'm here to pay tribute to the king,"" said Morganna Bramah, a 29-year-old Web site artist, who had just returned from Los Angeles where she had hoped to attend last week's memorial for Jackson. ""It's one of the most devastating heartbreaking things that has ever happened in my life. I just felt it was my duty to pay my respects who has given so much magic and light and beauty to my life."" Martin Russo, 28, and Enrico Ardito, 34, had travelled from Italy for the tribute. ""I grew up with his music and he is my only idol,"" said Russo. ""He had a special bond with his fans. Michael cared truly."" Sophie Bradley, who had flown in from the Middle East, said she had come to say thank you to Jackson. ""I had to come here. He was a father figure and a role model,"" said the 25-year-old. ""It's a chance for fans to talk and share stories and just remember how much he means to us."" Gemma White and Terry Shaw said they were still ""in denial"" about Jackson's death. ""I feel like I've lost a brother, a lover and a friend,"" said White. ""People say he was only a pop star but to us he wasn't. He was in our hearts. He was a person and the fans got to see that."" ""We came down here for Michael,"" added Shaw. ""It was the last thing we could do for him. It had to be done."" Jessica Prater from New York had tickets for Monday's show and had decided she would still come to London even before details of the evening's tribute were announced on Facebook. ""I didn't know so many people across the world were inspired by him,"" the 28-year-old said. ""I've met fans from Finland, Germany, France, the Congo. It's like a family reunion where you meet your long lost relatives. I'm really feeling the love and I know Michael's spirit is definitely here ."" Large whiteboards were erected at the O2 to allow fans to leave messages. After the vigil they'll be moved to opposite the box office so fans can continue to pay their respects. It's been less than one week since celebrities and die-hard Jackson fans packed the Staples Center in Los Angeles for an emotional farewell to the King of Pop. Questions still surround the circumstances of his sudden death less than three weeks before the scheduled start of his London shows. Investigators are still awaiting toxicology reports from the coroner's to determine the exact cause of death. The decision by fans to stage their own farewell to Michael Jackson at the O2 follows the absence of an official plan to commemorate the singer's life in London. Concert promoters AEG Worldwide are still unable to confirm reports that a tribute concert will be held at the O2 Arena, potentially on August 29, the date of what would have been Jackson's 51st birthday. ""There have been lots of talks going on about lots of things but nothing that I can confirm,"" Jones said. The first official Michael Jackson memorabilia is being offered by Bravado, the global merchandising division of Universal Music Group, and AEG Live which holds merchandising rights associated with the O2 concerts. Products said to have been personally approved by Jackson before the concert tour are available for pre-order on the Bandstore Web site. Late last week clothing had been shipped to retailer HMV. Play and Amazon were said to have received their consignments over the weekend. Items are being pushed out to try to beat bootleggers who are already producing Jackson mementos to cash in on demand from fans. So far only clothing is available, but the range is expected to expand to accessories over the coming weeks. ""There is a high level of demand. It's apparent that fans really want the official merchandise,"" a spokesman for Universal Music told CNN. The race to generate income following Jackson's death, from offering commemorative tickets in lieu of refunds to his concerts to the sale of T-shirts and CDs, has rankled some of his fans. Louise Costello refused a refund for her ticket to the London shows in favor of a commemorative ticket, but says the emphasis should be on the man, rather than the money. ""It's not all about money now. It's about a man whose life has gone. And he touched a lot of people as well, including myself,"" Costello told CNN. ""He was trying to save the world, and heal the world, things like that. He was a good man and I think they're taking advantage of the fact that he has a lot of people who love him."" Costello is not intending to go to O2 vigil tonight. Instead, she'll make her own pilgrimage to the O2 Arena on July 28, the date she was to see Jackson in concert. ""It's my way of paying my tribute. I'll go there and I'll listen to his music. It's just my way of remembering him,"" she said.","Jackson fans converge on London's O2 Arena Monday for memorial .

"TALLAHASSEE, Florida (CNN)  -- Florida Gov. Charlie Crist announced Tuesday he would not run for re-election next year and instead will seek the seat being vacated by retiring GOP Sen. Mel Martinez. Gov. Charlie Crist appeared alongside Sen. John McCain, left, during the 2008 presidential campaign. Crist, who unsuccessfully ran for the Senate in 1998, was immediately endorsed by the Senate Republican campaign arm, which hopes to avoid a bruising primary fight. Former state House Speaker Marco Rubio declared his intention last week to seek the GOP Senate nomination. ""Our country is facing the most profound public policy questions in our lifetime -- questions relating to the economy, taxes, healthcare, the environment and national security,"" Crist said in a statement released by his campaign. ""The answers to these questions will have a lasting impact on the country we love and the nation we will leave to our children and grandchildren."" He added in the statement: ""Here in Florida, we've shown that when we put people first and work together, much can be accomplished, and I intend to bring that same approach to Washington. That is why, after thoughtful consideration with my wife Carole, I have decided to run for the U.S. Senate."" A Quinnipiac Poll released last month showed Crist with a commanding 54 percent to 8 percent lead over Rubio in the Republican primary. But the poll also found that more people overall, and Republicans specifically, would rather see Crist run for re-election as governor than seek the Senate seat. Should Crist backers persuade Rubio to abandon his bid, it would help national Republicans focus money and resources on other races in 2010. The GOP needs to win back seats they lost in 2008 to help weaken the Democratic hold on the Senate. Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter's decision to change his political affiliation from Republican to Democrat and the increasing likelihood that Democrat Al Franken will eventually be named the next senator from Minnesota means that President Obama will have enough Democratic votes -- in theory -- for a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. Last week, the Senate GOP was dealt a setback when former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, a popular Republican, decided not to challenge Specter. But news that Crist would enter a Senate race was welcomed by Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who is chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ""While I believe Marco Rubio has a very bright future within the Republican Party, Charlie Crist is the best candidate in 2010 to ensure that we maintain the checks and balances that Floridians deserve in the United States Senate,"" Cornyn said in a statement. ""Governor Crist is a dedicated public servant and a dynamic leader, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee will provide our full support to ensure that he is elected the next United States Senator from Florida."" Rubio used a short blast on Twitter to chastise the NRSC for siding with Crist in the primary. ""Disappointed GOP senate comm endorses Crist on day 1,"" Rubio wrote. ""Remember that reform must always come from the outside. Status quo won't change itself."" GOP Rep. Vern Buchanan, who had been considering a Senate bid, instead said he would run for another term in the House and endorsed Crist. Anticipating his entry into the Senate race, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee last month aired its first television ad of the 2010 elections -- a small buy in the Tallahassee TV market -- that accused Crist of running away from the state's economic problems. Florida Democrats echoed that line of criticism Tuesday shortly after Crist declared his candidacy. ""By running for U.S. Senate, Charlie Crist has cut and run on the Sunshine State, once again taking the easy way out, avoiding responsibility and leaving the hard work of facing Florida's problems to the next governor,"" Florida Democratic Party Chair Karen Thurman said. ""At a time when Florida needs real leadership, unfortunately Charlie Crist is running from the mess he created, which is why Floridians are going to send Crist into retirement come Election Day."" Still, Crist remains very popular in the state that he has led since he was elected governor in 2006. His approval rating is at 66 percent, according to the Quinnipiac Poll. While it had been speculated for weeks that Crist would run for the Senate, the governor told reporters Tuesday that he made his final decision this past weekend to run for Martinez's seat. With conservatives and centrists battling for control of the Republican Party, the upcoming primary contest in Florida will be closely watched nationally. Crist is considered a centrist, while Rubio is trying to appeal to conservatives in the party. When asked to talk about his primary with Rubio and the future direction of the Republican Party, Crist instead spoke about bipartisanship. ""Well, I think what's important to bear in mind is that we do things a little bit differently here in Florida, and that's another reason that I run for the United States Senate,"" Crist told reporters at a news conference. ""We work together to solve problems and do what's right for the people of our state. The people are the boss. And I think regardless of party, we have to work together to get things done. And that's what I'd like to take to Washington, D.C."" Rep. Kendrick Meek, North Miami Mayor Kevin Burns and state Sen. Dan Gelber are all seeking the Democratic Senate nomination. CNN's Kevin Bohn and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","Gov. Crist says the country is ""facing the most profound public policy questions""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A former Army captain who was dismissed under a federal law dealing with gays and lesbians in the military lost his appeal Monday at the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to intervene in the challenge to the ""don't ask/don't tell"" law. James Pietrangelo and 11 other veterans had sued the government over the ""don't ask/ don't tell"" law passed in 1993. Pietrangelo was the only one who appealed to the high court, but the justices without comment refused to intervene. The provision forbids those in the military from openly acknowledging or revealing their homosexuality, and prevents the government from asking individual soldiers and sailors about their sexual orientation. The Obama administration had asked the high court not to take the case, and White House officials had said they would not object to homosexuals being kicked out of the armed services. During the presidential campaign last year, President Obama said he supported throwing out the federal law but has taken no specific action on the controversy. The Justice Department said in a high court filing the law was ""rationally related to the government's legitimate interest in military discipline and cohesion."" A federal appeals court in Boston, Massachusetts, had ruled against Pietrangelo, essentially ending his legal efforts. But a San Francisco, California-based federal appeals court ruled partially in favor of Maj. Margaret Witt, allowing her lawsuit against the Pentagon to move ahead. Those judges said the Air Force must prove the dismissal of the flight nurse would ensure troop readiness and cohesion. Justices say state judge should have recused himself . In a separate ruling, the high court on Monday found a state judge acted improperly when he refused to remove himself from a 2006 civil appeal despite having received financial support during his campaign from the CEO of the key defendant. Chief Justice Brent Benjamin of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals cast the deciding vote in favor of that company. In a 5-4 ruling, the justices found that a perceived conflict of interest should have led to the judge's recusal. ""On these extreme facts the probability of actual bias rises to an unconstitutional level,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote. The issue has become a touchstone of a growing political debate over whether judicial election races -- which have become more expensive and contentious in recent years -- erode public confidence in the legal system. The West Virginia case has attracted nationwide attention and was the basis for author John Grisham's 2008 best-seller, ""The Appeal."" The case now goes back to the state courts, where Benjamin likely will have to pull out of a rehearing. The U.S. Supreme Court issued a narrow ruling on the specific facts of the West Virginia dispute, but the implications are likely to be felt nationwide. Thirty-nine states elect some or all of their judges. The facts of the case read like a legal thriller. Businessman Don Blankenship, chairman of A.T. Massey Coal Co., spent $3 million supporting Benjamin's 2004 run for the judicial seat -- accounting for 60 percent of the money spent in support of his campaign. Massey was involved in a decade-old business dispute with Hugh Caperton, owner of rival Harman Mining. Caperton accused Massey of unlawfully interfering with his business relations. A jury agreed, and in 2002 awarded Harman Mining $50 million in compensatory and punitive damages. Massey waited four years to appeal. It was during those four years that Benjamin won his state high court seat. In April 2006, Benjamin declined to recuse himself from Massey's appeal, which had reached his five-member court. West Virginia, like most state and federal courts, leaves to an individual judge's discretion the decision to stay out of a case because of a potential conflict of interest.","Ex-Army Capt.

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer takes on Robin Soderling, who knocked out tournament favorite Rafael Nadal in a fourth-round stunner, in the men's final of the French Open on Sunday. Roger Federer screams in joy after beating Juan Martin del Potro to reach the French Open final. A victory in Roland Garros would give Federer 14 Grand Slams, tying his career wins to American Pete Sampras. The second-seed Federer lagged at first, but beat Argentine Juan Martin del Potro on Friday to make the final. Soderling advanced over Chilean Fernando Gonzalez. Federer, 27, has a 9-0 record over the 24-year-old Swede going into the final. The Swiss star has suffered emotional defeats recently. At England's Wimbledon last year, he lost to Rafael Nadal after a five-year reign. The game, which ran about seven hours with a few rain breaks, was the longest-ever Wimbledon men's final. Nadal also beat Federer in the Australian Open earlier this year. Soderling stunned the top-seed Nadal by handing him a loss in the fourth round of the French Open. The 23rd-seed Soderling was a rank outsider against the world number one who had never lost a match on the clay at Roland Garros and was a short-priced favorite to win a record fifth straight title. In women's tennis, number one Dinara Safina was beaten Saturday in straight sets by fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova in the final of the French Open at Roland Garros. Safina, who has reached the top of the world rankings despite not having a major title to her name, looked completely out-of-sorts against her compatriot, who secured a comfortable 6-4, 6-2 victory in just over an hour. The defeat was a crushing blow to Safina, 23, who has long had to contend with the accusations that she is not a worthy world number one -- and this third grand slam final defeat will do nothing to silence the doubters. It was the second straight year she has lost in the final here, after going down in straight sets to Ana Ivanovic of Serbia last year. It was also her second successive grand slam final defeat, having lost to Serena Williams in the Australian Open in Melbourne earlier this year.","A French Open win would give Federer 14 Grand Slams .

"(CNN)  -- Tamil Tiger rebels acknowledged the death of their leader Sunday, nearly a week after the Sri Lankan government said it had recovered the body of Velupillai Prabhakaran and declared victory in the country's 25-year civil war with the rebels. In this picture taken 27 November 2003, Velupillai Prabhakaran stands next to an LTTE flag. Prabhakaran ""attained martyrdom fighting the military oppression of the Sri Lankan state"" on May 17, according to Tamilnet.com, a rebel Web site, citing the group's international affairs spokesman. On Tuesday, President Mahinda Rajapaksa declared victory against the Tamil Tigers. ""We are celebrating the defeat of terrorism,"" he said in a nationally televised speech before parliament. ""We have won and restored democracy in the country."" The president declared a national holiday for the following day to celebrate the war's end and begin a new phase in the country's history.   Watch the victory parade » . A short time after the presidential address, the military announced that it had recovered the body of Prabhakaran, leader and founder of the Tamil Tigers. The rebels initially denied the death of their leader, claiming on Tamilnet.com that Prabhakaran was ""alive and safe."" The defense ministry said the bodies of Prabhakaran and 18 other senior rebel leaders were among corpses found in mop-up operations, after government troops routed the Tigers -- formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The leaders included Prabhakaran's eldest son, Charles Anthony, as well as Pottu Amman, the Tigers' intelligence leader, according to the ministry.  Watch the U.N. chief discuss the humanitarian crisis » . Prabhakaran founded the Tamil Tigers, who have been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries. It initiated the use of women in suicide attacks and, according to the FBI, invented the explosive suicide belt. Prabhakaran is accused of masterminding the killing of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 in the Tamil-dominated Indian state of Tami Nadu. Sri Lankan authorities allege that Prabhakaran was avenging Gandhi's decision to send Indian peacekeepers to Sri Lanka. Two years later, a Tigers suicide bomber, allegedly acting on Prabhakaran's orders, detonated explosives that killed Sri Lanka's then-president, Ranasinghe Premadasa, during a rally. The rebels have fought for an independent state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka since July 1983. An estimated 70,000 to 80,000 people have died during the quarter century of fighting.","Tamil Tiger rebels acknowledge the death of their leader Velupillai Prabhakaran .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- It was supposed to be a pleasant surprise, but turned into the shock of a lifetime. A woman scours a garbage heap in Tel Aviv for her mother's missing mattress. A woman in Tel Aviv, Israel, gave her elderly mother a new mattress as a surprise gift, throwing out the old tattered bed her mother had slept on for decades. The gesture ended up bankrupting Annat's mother, who had stuffed her savings of nearly $1 million inside her old bed for decades, Annat told Israel Army Radio. A massive search is under way at the city dump, where security has been beefed up to keep out treasure-seekers who have heard Annat's story in Israeli media. Annat, who did not want to reveal the rest of her name, told Israel Army Radio that she woke up early Sunday to get a good deal on a new mattress as a surprise for her mother. Sound off: Which bizarre places have you hidden money? She fell asleep that night, exhausted after lugging up the new mattress and hauling down the old one to be taken out with the trash. When her mother realized the next day what her daughter had done, she told her that she had been using the mattress to stash away her life savings and had nearly $1 million padding the inside of the worn-out mattress.  Watch more on the mattress search » . Annat ran downstairs, but it was too late. The garbage truck had already taken away the money-stuffed mattress. Annat alerted the two major dump sites in the Israeli city in an effort to locate the bed, but so far she has had no luck. Yitchak Burba, one of the dump site managers, told Army Radio that he and his men are working relentlessly to try to help Annat find the million-dollar mattress among the tons of garbage at the landfill. The publicity has triggered a wave of people also trying to find the mattress and its contents for themselves. Burba has increased security around the dump to keep them out. Annat told Army Radio that when her mother realized her queen-sized bank had been tossed, she told her to ""'leave it.'"" ""'The heart is crying but you know we could have been in a car accident or had a terminal disease,'"" Annat said her mother told her. Annat is also taking the situation in stride.

"DETROIT, Michigan (CNN) -- It's a stimulus plan on sneakers. The NCAA men's Final Four at Detroit's Ford Field could generate $30 million to $50 million from visitors. The NCAA men's basketball Final Four couldn't come at a better time for the city of Detroit -- the hard-hit capital of the U.S. auto industry at the center of the state of Michigan's economic woes. The 12-percent unemployment rate here is the highest in the nation, and with the Big Three automakers all needing multibillion-dollar government bailouts in an attempt to stay afloat, the future isn't much brighter, some say. ""We need some help,"" said Detroit resident Mark Franklin, who took his 5-year-old son to Friday's Hershey's College All-Star Game at Ford Field. ""There are too many people out of work already.

"STANFORD, California (CNN) -- Students and professors at Stanford University are protesting Donald Rumsfeld's appointment to a campus think tank, saying the former defense secretary does not uphold the ""ethical values"" of the school. Donald Rumsfeld has been appointed to the Hoover Institution, a think tank at Stanford University. Shortly after Rumsfeld's appointment was announced in September, professor Pamela Lee began an online petition from faculty members opposed to bringing him to the Hoover Institution. Since then, the petition has gained more than 3,500 signatures, including nearly 300 faculty members from such diverse disciplines as law, computer science, electrical engineering and drama. ""We view the appointment as fundamentally incompatible with the ethical values of truthfulness, tolerance, disinterested inquiry, respect for national and international laws, and care for the opinions, property and lives of others to which Stanford is inalienably committed,"" the petition reads. ""As word of the letter got out, my inbox was flooded with messages from professors, students, staff and alumni asking to sign on,"" said Lee, a professor of art history. The petition's signers include hundreds of Stanford students in addition to the faculty. ""He's a war criminal,"" said Sam Dubal, one petitioner, who also created a Facebook group called ""Rumsfeld -- You Are Not Welcome at Stanford!"" ""He's not worthy as an established member of Stanford,"" Dubal said. Despite the protests, school officials say that it is well within the Hoover Institution's right to appoint Rumsfeld. ""There are lots of temporary appointments made around the university,"" said Jeff Wachtel, special assistant to Stanford president John Hennessy. ""Departments have the right to invite people to campus in a variety of capacities."" Rumsfeld's one-year appointment as Distinguished Visiting Fellow places him on a task force on terrorism and ideology. He will be joined by current Hoover Fellow George Schultz, secretary of state under Ronald Reagan. Despite being housed in a tower on the center of campus, Hoover has only loose affiliation with the university. Meanwhile, supporters of Rumsfeld's appointment say that his presence on campus will help foster academic dialogue and fuel positive political discourse. The outcry against Rumsfeld follows last April's attempt by President Bush to visit campus. Bush planned to meet with Fellows at the Hoover Institution but was blocked by protesters. His meeting was later moved to Schultz's nearby house. ""Many of us believe that Donald Rumsfeld, in his role as secretary of defense, has behaved in ways that are dishonorable, disgraceful and always disingenuous,"" said Dr. Philip Zimbardo, professor emeritus of psychology. ""Rumsfeld authorized a list of interrogation methods that violated the Geneva Convention and the Convention against Torture used on detainees at Guantanamo Bay ... and Iraq's Abu Ghraib Prison,"" said Zimbardo, whose most recent book, ""The Lucifer Effect,"" finds that given the right ""situational"" influences, anyone can be made to participate in violent and depraved acts. Lee said her position does not discourage debate or public exchange of ideas. ""Let me stress that the petition objects to Rumsfeld's appointment as Distinguished Visiting Fellow, an appointment we find without merit,"" Lee said. ""In fact, there is nothing in the language of the petition that says Mr. Rumsfeld is forbidden to air his views at Stanford or is not welcome for a public lecture or open forum."" But not everyone disagrees with the appointment. ""Personally I disagree with his politics,"" said Brett Hammon, a political science major. ""But at the same time, I'm not sure I think it would be prudent for the university to refuse hiring him just because most students disagree with his politics. I know I would hate it if I went to school in Texas and the university refused to hire a prominent liberal politician just because most of the student body was conservative.""

"BAYAMON, Puerto Rico (CNN)  -- Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama took their campaigns to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico on Saturday in an effort to woo voters before the June 1 primary. There are 55 Democratic delegates up for grabs, though voters cannot take part in the general election in November. Obama campaigned early Saturday at the University of Puerto Rico in Bayamon, where he praised the nation's veterans before Memorial Day. ""It's fitting to be here today, not just because Memorial Day is around the corner but because Puerto Ricans are such an important part of the United States military. On this island and in Puerto Rican neighborhoods across America, you can go into almost any home and find a veteran living there or a photograph of a loved one in uniform hanging on the wall,"" he said. Obama also took aim at Republican Sen. John McCain over his opposition to an update of the GI Bill. The legislation passed the Senate on Thursday afternoon by a 75-22 vote and passed the House this month by a similar margin. It proposes to essentially provide a full scholarship to in-state public universities for members of the military who have served for at least three years. ""I don't understand why John McCain would side with George Bush and oppose our plan to make college more affordable for our veterans. ... Putting a college degree within reach for our veterans isn't being too generous; it's the least we can do for our heroes,"" Obama said. Shortly after Obama's remarks, the McCain campaign hit back. ""Barack Obama talks about helping veterans, but when the choice came between delivering for our military men and women and playing partisan politics, he decided politics was more important,"" McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said Saturday. Later Saturday, Obama marched along a street in San Juan, shaking hands with supporters as he walked in front of a banner that said ""Puerto Rico Con Obama."" This event was referred to as a ""caminata,"" a traditional parade for a candidate. Obama remarked to the crowd, ""I will never forget the support and the friendship that I've seen here in Puerto Rico. ... I am absolutely confident that if that we keep on working hard, there's no reason why we can't win here in Puerto Rico, and if we win Puerto Rico, we will win the nomination."" Clinton hosted a ""Solutions for Puerto Rico's Families"" town hall meeting in Aguadilla on Saturday. The former first lady may not have understood the language during her first campaign stop in Puerto Rico, but she certainly understood the politics. Before a crowd of a few hundred Puerto Ricans in a muggy high school gym, Clinton pledged to make it a ""personal priority"" to resolve the statehood issue before the end of her first term. She also vowed to clean up the former Navy testing ranges on Vieques, fund the famous Arecibo radio telescope, use federal dollars to put more cops on the streets and extend tax breaks to Puerto Rican companies. Clinton made each of those promises in English, abandoning a translator early on, despite the growing din among distracted audience members who couldn't understand the full content of her stump speech. Still, enthusiastic supporters hoisted signs like ""Puertorriquenos con Hillary"" and ""Hillary Presidenta"" while chants of ""Hillary! Hillary!"" filled the room. Despite in the language barrier, Clinton seemed to be on familiar ground. She recalled a visit she made to the island in 1998 on behalf of her husband to inspect damage from Hurricane Georges. She also reminded the audience that she represents more than one million Puerto Ricans in New York; this week in Florida, she jokingly referred to herself as ""the senator from Puerto Rico."" Clinton has done well among Hispanic voters in this year's primaries, and she is expected to have similar success in Puerto Rico. On Thursday, Clinton sent daughter Chelsea to campaign in Puerto Rico, a sign that she is refusing to give up the race despite the delegate math in favor of her rival. According to CNN's latest estimate, Obama leads Clinton in total delegates, 1,969 to 1,779. However, Obama does not have enough delegates to secure the nomination outright. He has 1,962 delegates, including superdelegates, short of the 2,026 needed to secure the nomination, according to CNN estimates. Obama was in Florida on Friday courting the Cuban vote, a bloc that has tended to vote Republican in past elections. With a 70 percent turnout rate, Cuban-Americans have been a powerful force in Florida and thus, because of Florida's role as a swing state, national politics. He told Florida's Cuban-American community Friday that his Cuba policy would be based on liberty and freedom for the island nation's people.  Watch more of Obama's comments » . ""My policy toward Cuba will be guided by one word: 'libertad,' "" he said, using the Spanish word for liberty at an event celebrating Cuban Independence Day in Miami, Florida.

"(CNN)  -- Spurred by the continuing political unrest in Iran, more than two dozen Iranian expatriate superstars are uniting to spread a musical message of non-violent resistance. Neda Agha-Soltan was gunned down on a Tehran street on June 20. The entertainers, poets, thinkers and actors are harmonizing on the song ""United for Neda,"" a call to action against human rights violations by the Iranian government against Iranians protesting the disputed outcome of recent presidential elections. The song was inspired by the plight of Neda Agha-Soltan, the 26-year old Iranian woman who was fatally shot on the streets of Tehran on June 20. The ordeal was recorded on cell phone video and received international attention when it hit the Internet. ""When I saw links to Neda being shot, it was so disturbing to me,"" said Iranian-British recording artist Mams Taylor, who wrote and produced the song. ""It hurt me, angered me and touched me at the same time, to think that these people are so courageous to go and seek their freedom,"" said Taylor. While her death became a rallying point for justice, her name, ""Neda,"" in Farsi means ""the call/calling"" or ""voice"" -- a voice many people say cannot be muted. ""The saga is still going on in Iran, and all we can do is carry on and echo their voice,"" said Shoreh Aghdashloo, the Oscar-nominated actress from ""House of Sand and Fog"" who sang in the production. The video, much like the post-election protests, was a spontaneous response. From the studio to the street rallies in Los Angeles, California, the entire music video was filmed using a cell phone. ""With the big media ban and restrictions over there, we thought to commemorate and pay homage to what the protesters are doing over there,"" said Taylor. ""So we thought it would be appropriate to develop the video in the same kind of light.""  Watch the video and hear the song » . The song was recorded in both English and Farsi to reach Western and Iranian audiences. The English version of the video has drawn thousands of viewers since its YouTube release last week. The Farsi version of the song will be released Thursday. Iranian actress Shila Vosough played a key role in bringing the artists together. ""These artists all came together despite their varying political views,"" she said. ""They united, hand-in-hand, to send the kids in Iran a message of their love and support."" The political upheaval of the late 1970s forced many Iranian musicians, artists, actors and entertainers like Vosough into exile. Many of them left unwillingly, not knowing when or if they would ever return to Iran. ""I came to New York for a performance 32 years ago and have never been back to Iran since,"" said Iranian vocalist Sattar, who also sang in the video. Sattar, who has millions of fans around the world, wants the Iranian people to know their voices are being heard. ""As an artist, I see this as my responsibility -- to support Iranians with my songs and music,"" said Sattar, a one-time favorite of the Pahlavi royal family in Iran. In 1979, at the dawn of the Islamic Republic under much popular Western music was outlawed as ""un-Islamic."" For years, Iranians have been forced to make music underground, buying or swapping on the black market or downloading from the Internet. ""Music is a very powerful tool. It can move people and mobilize them around a cause, and this can be very threatening for leaders who want to silence the voices of their people,"" said Iranian singer Dariush. Dariush has been singing about love, peace, freedom and justice for the Iranian people since before he left 30 years ago. ""I encourage other musicians to come join the cause against human rights violations in Iran and other places around the world,"" said Dariush. Female singers were also banned after the revolution. For decades female vocalists like Googoosh, one of the most celebrated pop divas in Iran, were silenced and forbidden to perform or record in Iran. In 2000, Googoosh left Iran. Shortly afterward, she made a comeback on the international stage, performing in front of sold-out crowds at venues around the world. Her latest release, ""Man Hamoon Iranam,"" or ""I Am the Same Iran,"" is also dedicated to the young Iranians who died in the unrest. Scores of musicians have tuned into the cause, showing support both in performance and on the Internet. Just last week in Barcelona, Spain, the band U2 dedicated the song ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" to the Iranian people and performed under a green-lit banner as Farsi lyrics scrolled up the screen. The opposition in Iran has adopted green as its unifying color. Other Iran-related videos that went viral on YouTube are the remake of ""Stand By Me"" by Iranian singer Andy and American rockers Bon Jovi; Joan Baez's ""We Shall Overcome"" tribute; and Wyclef Jean's performance of ""Equal Rights and Justice."" ""I hope the Iranians realize that here in the West there are people supporting and backing their movement to seek freedom, and we would like to motivate them to keep going,"" said Mams Taylor.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Pregnant women in Peru are dying at scandalous rates, according to the author of an Amnesty International report into maternal mortality in the South American country. The report, ""Fatal Flaws: Barriers to Maternal Health in Peru"" found that hundreds of poor, rural and indigenous pregnant women are dying because they are being denied the same health services as other women in the country. It also concluded that the government's response to tackling the problem was inadequate. Peruvian government figures state 185 in every 100,000 women die in childbirth, but the United Nations says the number is much higher, 240 per 100,000, which makes it one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the Americas. In wealthy developed nations, only nine women die for every 100,000 births. The five main causes of pregnancy-related deaths in Peru are hemorrhage, pre-eclampsia, infection, complications following abortion and obstructed birth, according to Peru's Ministry of Health figures. Amnesty's Peru researcher Nuria Garcia said, in a written statement: ""The rates of maternal mortality in Peru are scandalous. The fact that so many women are dying from preventable causes is a human rights violation. ""The Peruvian state is simply ignoring its obligation to provide adequate maternal health care to all women, regardless of who they are and where they live."" Garcia added: ""Health services for pregnant women in Peru are like a lottery: If you are poor and indigenous, the chances are you will always lose."" The report said pregnant women in Peru die because they lack access to emergency obstetric care, to information on maternal health, and to health staff members who can speak Indigenous languages such as Quechua -- a native Andean language spoken by some 5 million people in Peru. According to the report, 27 percent of deaths of women from pregnancy-related causes occurred during pregnancy; 26 percent occurred during the birth itself; and 46 percent during the first six weeks after giving birth. A 2007 Census of Indigenous People showed that 60 percent did not have access to a health facility, said Amnesty International. The Amnesty International report notes that the Peruvian government has instituted policies aimed at reducing the rates of maternal mortality, such as increasing maternal waiting houses -- rooms where pregnant women who live far from health centers can stay. Other measures include more training for health staff members on the vertical birth method common among indigenous women and teaching the Quiche language to health professionals, Amnesty International said. But the human rights group said Peruvian women and health professionals have complained that the measures are not being implemented effectively. For example, the rights group said, even though the number of waiting houses has increased more than threefold in the past eight years, only half of them are in rural areas. The agency also contends that training for health professionals on the vertical birth method is not sufficiently widespread. According to Peru's Human Rights ombudsperson, more than 45 percent of health staff last year said they had not received appropriate training, Amnesty International said. ""Official initiatives to reduce maternal mortality are good news,"" Garcia said. ""However, lack of clear responsibilities for implementing them and the absence of effective resourcing and monitoring puts any initiative in great jeopardy."" Though Peru's rate of maternal deaths is high, it pales in comparison to sub-Saharan Africa, which has about 900 deaths for each 100,000 births, the United Nations says. For Africa as a whole, the number is 820. The highest rates were in Sierra Leone, with 2,000, and Afghanistan, with 1,900. Latin America and the Caribbean average 130 deaths per 100,000 births, the United Nations says, with the lowest rates in Chile, Costa Rica and Cuba. Worldwide, there were an average of 400 deaths for each 100,000 births in the year 2000, the United Nations says. The lowest rates were in Iceland, with zero, and Austria, with four per 100,000 births. The United States had 11 deaths per 100,000 births in 2005, the United Nations says.

"(CNN) -- Millions of people around the world have taken part in ceremonies marking the 100th anniversary of the Scouting movement. Scouts renewed their promise to build a tolerant and peaceful society. Dawn celebrations involving 28 million young people took place across the globe, from Ecuador to Bhutan. In southern England, 40,000 young people from around the globe gathered to take part in the largest ever 12-day world Scout Jamboree. The island where the movement was born, Brownsea Island off the coast of England, has been the focus of celebrations, with 300 scouts from more than 160 countries attending a commemorative camp. It was on that site that Scouting founder Robert Baden-Powell held an experimental camp for 20 boys, following his experiences in the Army during the Boer War. The movement requests its members, boys and girls from the age of six, to uphold values such as trustworthiness, loyalty and to ""do their best"". Scouts from countries including the UK, Lebanon, Nepal, Rwanda, Serbia, Libya and Argentina, displayed their flags on the island, before taking part in a sunrise ceremony. In Romania, scouts formed a human chain around the Parliament building in the capital Bucharest to express how young people will play a role in the country's future. In Namibia, Africa, around 1,000 scouts cooked breakfast over a camp fire, and groups from Malawi camped at the top of Mulanje mountain. The Taj Mahal in India, the Eiffel Tower in Paris and the Sydney Opera House in Australia also witnessed sunrise ceremonies. The small gathering at Brownsea Island led the rest of the globe in renewing their Scouting promise to build a tolerant and peaceful society. A speech written by Baden-Powell during the first scout camp was also read out to the group. It includes a call for peace, comradeship and cooperation over rivalry between ""classes, creeds and countries which have done so much in the past to produce wars and unrest"". Alistair, 16, from Manchester, at the Brownsea Island ceremony, said: ""It has made me think how one man has changed the world. ""It is one world, one promise. We are all here as peace ambassadors. We are the next generation. We are the ones bringing peace forward into the world,"" he told the Press Association. Ana Mejia, 14, from Honduras, added: ""It doesn't matter what our nationality, our religion, our color, we are a family and we have to support each other.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has defended the UK's involvement in the war in Afghanistan following the British Army's bloodiest day of the near eight-year conflict. Soldiers from the Welsh Guards carry the coffin of Maj Sean Birchall, killed on patrol in Afghanistan in June. Addressing lawmakers on Monday, Brown said the security of Afghanistan was crucial to preventing terrorist attacks elsewhere in the world. ""In 2009 the case for our continued involvement is the same: to prevent terrorist attacks in Britain and across the world by dealing with the terrorist threat at its source -- that crucible of terror on the border and mountain areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan,"" Brown told the House of Commons. ""I am confident that we are right to be in Afghanistan, that we have the strongest plan and the resources to do the job."" Brown also rejected suggestions that British troops, who are fighting alongside other coalition and Afghan forces in Helmand province, are dying unnecessarily because they do not have enough helicopters -- leaving them vunerable to ambush because they have to travel by road.  See a map of Helmand province » . ""It's a sad fact that helicopters would not have saved the lives of the individuals last week,"" he said, citing Lt. Col. Nick Richardson, a British military spokesman in Afghanistan. ""British armed forces are better equipped today than at any time... in the past 40 years. In the last two years we have increased helicopter numbers by 60 percent and... capacity by 84 percent."" But opposition leader David Cameron argued that helicopter capacity in Afghanistan has not risen as fast as troop levels. ""Isn't the real point this, that the number of troops has doubled since 2006, so proportionally there hasn't really been in increase in helicopter capacity at all?"" the leader of the Conservative Party demanded. The former chief of the defense staff, Charles Guthrie, ""has said more helicopters would save lives,"" Cameron said. The United Kingdom has been shocked by the deaths of 15 troops in 10 days, including eight in a 24-hour period.  Watch profiles of six British soldiers killled in Afghanistan on the same day » .

""If we cannot move our forces by air, they are more vulnerable on the ground,"" Conservative defense spokesman Liam Fox said Monday, asking if the Labour government had made a mistake by cutting the helicopter budget in 2004. Defense Secretary Bob Ainsworth dismissed the criticism. British forces are ""taking on the Taliban in one of their heartland areas,"" he told lawmakers. ""That kind of ""hand-to-hand fighting... cannot be conducted from inside a highly armored vehicle and it cannot be conducted from a helicopter."" Ainsworth said more helicopters were on the way, but that many operations ""cannot be conducted from helicopters."" On Monday the Stop the War Coalition, which has campaigned against British involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq, urged Brown to withdraw all British troops from Afghanistan, calling the conflict ""an unwinnable and unjustified war."" ""We urge the British government to end now this futile war which, if continued, will only mean more wasted lives of British soldiers, countless deaths of Afghan civilians and further devastation of a country that has suffered from decades of war and occupation,"" the group said in a statement.","Gordon Brown: Afghanistan campaign crucial to preventing terror attacks .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Coordinated attacks in at least eight Mexican cities killed three federal police officers and two soldiers Saturday in what officials are calling an unprecedented onslaught by drug gangs. Attacks occurred after arrest of Arnoldo Rueda Medina, a high-ranking member of La Familia Michoacana. Another 18 federal officers were wounded, the state-run Notimex news agency reported, citing federal police official Rodolfo Cruz Lopez. The attacks were in retribution for the capture early Saturday of Arnoldo Rueda Medina, a high-ranking member of the drug cartel known as La Familia Michoacana (The Michoacan Family), Notimex reported. Rueda is considered second in command to the group's two top leaders, Nazario ""El Chayo"" Moreno González and José "" El Chango"" de Jesús Méndez Vargas, acting as a ""right arm"" to Moreno, the secretary of public security said Saturday in a statement. Among other allegations, he was arrested for his role in designing the hierarchy of the organization, the production of synthetic drugs and movement of marijuana and cocaine to the United States, said Mexico's secretary of public security. Rueda was arrested along with a 17-year-old male who worked for him. Following his arrest Saturday morning in Morelia, Michoacan, men armed with high-powered rifles and grenades attacked the police station where he was being held, the Secretary of Public Security said. After failing to win his freedom, members of the group launched attacks in the cities of Morelia, Zitacuaro, Zamora, Lazaro Cardenas, Apatzingan, La Piedad and Huetamo in Michoacan state, Notimex news said, citing federal police. The three officers were killed in Zitacuaro, police official Eduardo Moran told CNN en Español, while six police officers were reported wounded in Morelia. Two soldiers were killed in Zamora, shot by men in a passing car as they walked to their headquarters. The Secretary of Public Security told the newspaper Cambio de Michoacan that 25 spent shells from an R-15 rifle and 17 from an AK-47 were found at the scene. Michoacan is in west-central Mexico, on the Pacific coast. Another rifle and grenade attack took place near Acapulco in Guerrero state, which borders Michoacan, but no one was injured. Saturday's attacks came just days after a drug gang in Tijuana declared they were at war with police, threatening to kill five officers every week until Police Chief Julian Leyzaola resigns. The threat was made in a note found on the windshield of a slain officer's car, news reports said. At least three Tijuana officers have been killed since Monday, reports said. Leyzaola, a former army colonel, replaced a police chief removed from office in December after receiving numerous threats. ""Leyzaola has become the poster boy for honest police work, which has put the drug gangs on notice,"" Vicente Calderon, a reporter for the Tijuana Press news agency, told CNN affiliate KUSI. ""They believe he is serious, that he means business and is trying to re-establish the rule of law that has been affecting the city and whole state for many years since organized crime established themselves in Baja [California]."" Tijuana, the westernmost city in Mexico, is across the border from San Diego, California. Sixteen police officers have died there in 2009, and officers are now patrolling the city in groups of six, KUSI reported.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq awarded a lucrative oil contract to BP and China National Petroleum Corp., government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said Wednesday, while rejecting other companies' offers for other oil fields. BP and China National Petroleum Corporation have won a lucrative oil contract in Iraq. The joint BP-CNPC bid was for the al-Rumeila oil field, one of the largest in the world. The energy companies are expected to increase production at the oil field by 50 percent, to 285,000 barrels a day, for a service charge of $2 for each additional barrel produced, al-Dabbagh said in a statement. The Iraqi government rejected bids for five other oil fields and a natural gas field because the bidders did not agree to the service charge set by the Ministry of Oil, he said. The Ministry of Oil rejected the idea that the failure to award more than one contract made the much-anticipated auction a flop. Iraq did not say how much the BP-CNPC bid was worth. It runs for 20 years. Oil Minister Hussein Shahrastani chaired the government-sponsored auction for the oil and natural gas field contracts Tuesday, after a day's delay due to a sandstorm. Much of the auction was broadcast live on state television, which Ministry of Oil spokesman Assem Jihad told CNN was a sign of the transparency of the process. He said the government was satisfied with the auction, even though only one contract was awarded, because the contract was for Iraq's largest oil field. Iraq plans to open bidding this year on 10 more oil fields and one natural gas field, all of which are undeveloped, Jihad said. The companies whose bids were rejected Tuesday have been given time to review their offers, he said. Iraq has some of the largest oil reserves in the world, with an estimated 115 billion barrels -- tying Iran for second place, behind Saudi Arabia's 264 billion barrels, according to estimates from the Energy Information Administration in the United States. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh in Baghdad contributed to this report.","Iraq awards lucrative oil contract to BP, China National Petroleum Corporation .

"HUNTINGDON VALLEY, Pennsylvania (CNN)  -- The president of The Valley Swim Club on Friday strongly denied charges of racism after his club canceled the swimming privileges of a nearby day care center whose children are predominantly African-American. John Duesler said he underestimated the number of swimmers who would come to swim at the club. ""It was never our intention to offend anyone,"" said John Duesler. ""This thing has been blown out of proportion."" Duesler said his club -- which he called ""very diverse"" -- invited camps in the Philadelphia area to use his facility because of the number of pools in the region closed due to budget cuts this summer. He said he underestimated the amount of children who would participate, and the club's capacity to take on the groups was not up to the task. ""It was a safety issue,"" he said. The Creative Steps Day Care children -- who are in kindergarten through seventh grade -- went to The Valley Swim Club in Huntingdon Valley on June 29 after the center's director, Alethea Wright, had contracted to use the club once a week. During their first visit, some children said they heard club members asking why African-American children were there. One youngster told a Philadelphia television station a woman there said she feared the children ""might do something"" to her child.  Watch Wright react to comments allegedly aimed at the children » . Days later, the day care center's $1,950 check was returned without explanation, Wright said. She was dismissive of Duesler's comments Friday. ""He knows what happened at the pool that day,"" Wright told CNN in a telephone interview. ""I was embarrassed and humiliated."" She called it an ""unfortunate situation,"" adding, ""I know what happened; the members know what happened and a higher power knows what happened.""  Watch the club president say racism is not at play » . After news reports of the incident, the office of Sen. Arlen Specter (D-Pennsylvania) said Specter sent a letter to the club president asking him to reinstate the contract with Creative Steps, saying, ""I think that you would agree that there is no place for racism in America today."" Duesler said he appreciates the senator's concern, but the club's board has yet to make a decision of how it will proceed. ""If we're going to revise our policies here, we need to make it so for all the camps,"" he said. ""I just don't think we're prepared for that."" Duesler earlier in the week told two Philadelphia television stations the children had changed ""the complexion"" and ""atmosphere"" of the club, a comment that protesters outside the facility Thursday said showed that racism was involved. Bernice Duesler, John Duesler's wife, called the negative response her husband has faced since the incident ""unbearable."" ""He's not one of the good guys -- he's one of the great guys,"" she said, holding back tears. ""He doesn't deserve this."" She added, ""If there really was a racial issue that happened, my husband and I would be the first one[s] picketing."" Jim Flynn, who said he was one of the club members who made a complaint against the children, told CNN this week it was not racially motivated. ""There were a lot of children in the pool and not enough lifeguards,"" he said. ""As general members we were not told that they were coming. If we knew, we could decide to not come when the pool was crowded or come anyway. We could have had an option."" He also said invitations to two other day care centers, neither of which contained minority children, had previously been withdrawn. Girard College, a private Philadelphia boarding school, told CNN on Thursday it would offer Creative Steps Day Care use of its facilities this summer.","Swim club president John Duesler: ""It was never our intention to offend anyone""

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- Mexican officials said they have identified two suspects in this week's slayings of two Americans in northern Mexico. Mourners carry the coffin of Benjamin LeBaron, 32, on Thursday in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. A security camera at a toll booth near the municipality of Galeana captured images of the suspects, Chihuahua state Attorney General Patricia Gonzalez Rodriguez said Thursday, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. Gonzalez declined to name the suspects, other than to say they belong to a crime organization known as ""La Linea"" (The Line). The toll booth cameras show four trucks or sport utility vehicles in which 12 suspects were riding, she said. No arrests had been reported by Friday. Benjamin LeBaron, 32, and his brother-in-law, Luis Widmar, who was in his mid-30s, were beaten and shot to death after armed men stormed into their home Tuesday morning in Galeana. Arturo Sandoval, a spokesman for the Chihuahua attorney general's office, said earlier this week that a note was found on LeBaron's body but he could not confirm the contents. Local media reported the note indicated the slayings were in retribution for the capture of 25 drug suspects in a nearby town. LeBaron's younger brother, Eric, was kidnapped in May and returned unharmed a week later. The kidnapping prompted LeBaron to become a nationally recognized anti-crime activist who moved the local community to take a stand. ""There are no leaders here, or we are all leaders,"" LeBaron's brother Julian LeBaron told CNN affiliate KINT-TV in El Paso, Texas, this week. ""If they kill my brother, another three will take his place. And if they kill us, another hundred will take their place. We are not giving up. No way."" The LeBaron brothers belonged to the ""Community of LeBaron"" in the municipality of Galeana, a township founded by ex-communicated Mormons.

"Editor's note: Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a member of the San Diego Union-Tribune editorial board, a nationally syndicated columnist and a regular contributor to CNN.com. Read his column here. Ruben Navarrette Jr. says President Felipe Calderon's war on drugs remains a noble battle for the soul of Mexico. SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- It has nothing to do with Michael Jackson or Sarah Palin, but there's a big story brewing south of the border to which Americans should pay close attention. Like a monster that refuses to die, Mexico's once-disgraced Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, made a convincing comeback in last weekend's midterm elections. The PRI recaptured its majority in the 500-member Chamber of Deputies and won five of six governorships up for grabs. The rival National Action Party, or PAN, which had controlled the legislative branch since 2000, suffered heavy losses. German Martinez, president of the PAN, resigned this week after taking responsibility for the electoral failures. Political observers on both sides of the border are calling the elections results a no-confidence vote in the Mexican economy and a significant rebuke to President Felipe Calderon's admirable but all-consuming war against the drug cartels. Calderon -- who is in the PAN -- is halfway through a six-year term, so he wasn't on the ballot. The presidency is next on the ballot in 2012, and observers think that the fact that the PRI aced its midterms sets the party up nicely to accomplish something that seemed unthinkable just a few years ago: retake the top job that it held for much of the 20th century -- 71 years, to be precise -- through corruption and intimidation. In 2000, the PAN's Vicente Fox broke that streak and reintroduced democracy in Mexico. Calderon squeaked out a narrow victory against a third-party candidate in 2006. The Harvard-educated lawyer and economist immediately and bravely took the fight to drug lords across the country, unleashing the military in a conflict that has so far killed more than 10,000 Mexicans with no end in sight. And there are now serious issues -- as spelled out this week in The Washington Post -- involving allegations of torture, forced disappearances and other abuse by the Mexican military as it seeks to retaliate for the killing of soldiers and other terrorist acts committed by the drug cartels. The Obama administration, which has pledged to support Calderon's drug war, would no doubt like to put an end to this alleged behavior before paying out the remainder of the $1.4 billion in aid to Mexico that Congress approved in the Merida Initiative. The trouble is that President Obama has been reluctant to make human rights demands of an adversary such as Iran, which could make it hard to lean on a friend such as Mexico. And as Mexican human rights activists point out, the U.S. government is in a difficult position to preach against torture given that it is accused of using it in Iraq, Afghanistan and at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Still, Calderon's war remains a noble battle for the soul of Mexico. And there's evidence that the drug cartels are feeling the pinch. Unable to move their product to customers in Canada and the United States, the cartels are growing desperate. The Calderon government is seizing so much of the product and arresting or killing so many drug traffickers, that profits are slipping. The drug lords are forced to import more guns from the United States at higher prices and channel more drug shipments to Mexican customers, who pay lower prices than the cartels could charge Americans if the drugs were making their way north. This is bad news for the traffickers. But it's great news for the Mexican people, even if they don't know it. Judging from reports in the Mexican press, many Mexicans -- while supportive of the drug war -- think it ultimately will fail, and they're tired of the violence. Many fault Calderon for, in a popular metaphor, ""stirring the hornet's nest."" Meanwhile, although the PRI didn't explicitly campaign on a platform of being anti-drug war, the implied message was that returning the party to power could return tranquillity and security to Mexico. Good luck with that, amigos. Guess what? The hornets aren't going back in the nest. Calderon should get to the bottom of allegations of military abuse and punish any offenders. But he should also press ahead. And, if the PRI tries to get in the way by, say, limiting the resources to fight the drug war, then Calderon should paint the party as trying to appease the cartels at the expense of Mexico. The PRI was so preoccupied with gaining power as it did in the past that it forgot that what leadership is really about is taking responsibility for the future. Here's its chance.","Mexican leader Felipe Calderon may face defeat in 2012 after PRI makes comeback .

"(CNN) -- The investigation of the E. coli outbreak linked to Nestle Toll House cookie dough is nearly over, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The cause of the contamination has not been identified. Nestle recalled all its Toll House refrigerated cookie dough products made at a Danville, Virginia, plant. David Acheson, the FDA's associate commissioner for foods, says the samples of cookie dough his agency has tested do not contain the E. coli strain that sickened 74 people in 32 states. On June 19, Nestle recalled all its Toll House refrigerated cookie dough products made at a Danville, Virginia, plant. Thirty-four people have been hospitalized; no deaths have been reported. The CDC reports that the majority of the patients were teenage girls who reported eating the cookie dough raw. Last month, the FDA found E. coli in a production sample of Toll House cookie dough, but after testing, investigators found that the strain in the sample did not match the outbreak strain. ""We are still in speculation mode,"" Acheson said, but the E. coli ""most likely came from raw ingredients"" such as flour. The E.coli strain that caused the outbreak, 0157:H7, is typically found in fecal contamination from animals such as cows, sheep or goats. Acheson points out that it's not unusual for those animals to be carrying more than one strain of the bacteria. But he believes that the root cause of the contamination may never be known. ""We have to conclude we're unlikely to have a definitive determination,"" he said. Most people with E. coli 0157:H7 experience diarrhea and abdominal cramps within eight days of infection. The FDA notified Nestle USA on Thursday that its investigation at the Danville plant was over. Nestle says FDA inspectors were at the plant for more than a week and found no E. coli on equipment. More than 1,000 tests have been conducted at the facility after the outbreak. ""We've dismantled the production line and done extensive testing on all equipment and not found any E. coli,"" Nestle USA spokeswoman Laurie MacDonald said. MacDonald announced that Nestle is easing back into production at the plant. The company has purchased new lots of eggs, flour and margarine and says it is thoroughly testing the new products and all raw ingredients. Consumers will have to wait to see cookie dough back in grocery stores. ""You're not going to see anything on the shelves for quite some time,"" MacDonald said. But when it does appear, the company will mark the cookie dough with a new label that clearly designates it as a new batch. It will also continue to carry a reminder to not eat the dough raw.","FDA says Toll House samples don't contain particular strain of E. coli .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- A mob killed a Hindu man in the Indian state of Orissa Thursday as another group attacked a church in another part of the state's troubled Kandhamal district, authorities said Friday. Christian activists stage a peace march in Mumbai, India earlier this month. Krishan Kumar, Kandhamal's top administrative official, told CNN the Hindu man was hacked to death at Raikia. Orissa state, which is dominated by tribal people, borders the Bay of Bengal in east-central India, and Kandhamal is located in the center of the state, which has been racked by Hindu-Christian violence. Praveen Kumar, Kandhamal's superintendent of police, said an investigation is under way in both incidents, and did not say whether any suspects were being sought. Twenty-three civilians, excluding police, have died in the Hindu-Christian violence in Kandhamal this month, according to the administrator. ""Arrests are continuing,"" Praveen Kumar said when asked how many people have been held so far in connection with the violence. The latest attacks occurred on a day when India's federal government called upon the state administration to take ""effective, focused and firm measures"" to control the conflicts.

"(CNN) -- Somalia's transitional government has the right to request military help from its neighbors against armed militants, the African Union said Monday, but Kenya was quick to reject the idea of sending troops and suggested the AU should spearhead such a move. Islamist insurgents patrol part of Mogadishu during clashes with government forces. Somali parliament speaker Sheikh Adan Madowe on Saturday called on Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Yemen to send in their military forces to help government troops stop hardline Islamist militants from taking over. ""Militants are wrestling the power from the government and so we call for military help from neighboring countries,"" the speaker said at a news conference in Mogadishu. ""Please send your military to help in 24 hours' time."" But Alfred Mutua, spokesman for the Kenyan government, told CNN that ""Kenya doesn't engage in military support to our neighbors."" He said that any such support would be under the umbrella of the African Union. However, he did say that ""different types of support can be given, not just military, and Kenya's options are open."" He said that the government should announce by Wednesday how it will move forward. Jean Ping, chairman of the African Union Commission, said in a communique issued Sunday that the transitional government, as Somalia's legitimate government, ""has the right to seek support from AU Member States and the larger international community."" Ping also said that the AU would ""continue to do its utmost to assist the Somali people and its authorities in their lasting quest for peace and reconciliation."" Somalia's call for help came hours after a third top politician was killed in ongoing fighting in the capital. Mohamed Hussein Adow, a powerful member of parliament who was leading the fight against the Islamists, was slain Friday in the north of the city. His death came two days after Islamists killed Internal Security Minister Omar Hashi Adan in a suicide attack in central Somalia. The nation's former ambassador to Ethiopia, Abdikarin Farah Laqanyo, was also killed, along with at least 11 others, government officials said. Madowe said a Pakistani militant who is a high-ranking official in al Qaeda is leading the fighting in Somalia against the government. He warned that militants will spread fighting into the rest of the region if they topple the government in Somalia.

"(CNN)  -- Two of the biggest stars in the NBA will be team-mates next season after a blockbuster trade which sees Shaquille O'Neal move from the Phoenix Suns to the Cleveland Cavaliers -- the home of league MVP LeBron James. Shaquille O'Neal is hoping his arrival will put a smile on the faces of Cleveland fans. The 37-year-old O'Neal is one of the all-time greats of basketball, winning four NBA championships, three straight with the Los Angeles Lakers and the other with Miami Heat. James is widely recognized as the sport's current superstar, but the 24-year-old has been left frustrated by Cleveland's failure to win the title. He stormed off the court after  their loss to the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference finals, not even shaking hands with 2008 Olympic teammate Dwight Howard. The trade, which sees Phoenix get center Ben Wallace and guard Sasha Pavlovic, has been talked about since February but finalized on Thursday night. ""I was elated about the trade because I get to play with one of the greatest players to ever play the game in LeBron James,"" O'Neal was quoted on the NBA's official Web site www.nba.com. O'Neal averaged 17.8 points and 8.4 rebounds in 75 games for the Suns last season and believes he still has much to offer the NBA. ""My numbers are not good enough to retire. Three more years left,"" O'Neal wrote on his Twitter blog. His career averages are 24.7 points, 11.3 rebounds and 2.4 blocked shots, with his peak seasons coming as he led the Lakers to three straight titles from 2000-02. The Lakers traded him to Miami where he spent three seasons, helping them to the NBA Championship three years ago. He has played in Phoenix for the past two years, restricted by injuries in his first season. The Cavs, powered by James, won 66 regular season games and their first eight in the playoffs before coming unstuck against the Magic. They will be hoping that O'Neal will be the final piece in the jigsaw to land the first American sports championship for Cleveland in 45 years.","Shaquille O'Neal is traded from the Phoenix Suns to the Cleveland Cavaliers .

"Editor's Note: This is the second in a five-part series exploring Judge Sonia Sotomayor's background and life with those who know her, and revealing the experiences that might shape her views as a Supreme Court justice if confirmed. Sonia Sotomayor, here at her 8th-grade graduation, had to finish homework and chores before she could go out. BRONX, New York (CNN) -- The teenage Sonia Sotomayor was easy to spot in the halls of her New York high school. Her uniform was often askew -- a once-crisp shirt protruding out and over her skirt's waistband as she carried a pile of books. ""She was focused so much on learning that she didn't notice,"" Mary Procidano, a classmate at Cardinal Spellman High School, recalled recently. Sotomayor, now nominated for the Supreme Court by President Obama, seemed to hit her stride at Spellman, a rigorous Catholic institution and educational oasis in a crime-stricken neighborhood of the Bronx. The schoolgirl first appeared shy and reserved, friends remember. But they soon got to know her as a hard-nosed, strong-willed girl, happy to debate friends, family or teachers. ""When she opened her mouth and she spoke, she really felt whatever it was,"" said Jeanette Valdespino-Torres, a childhood friend. ""And she wasn't just talking out of the top of her head -- it was something that she read, she studied, she looked, she knew. She would get into conversations at that age that I couldn't even touch.""  Watch friends remember Sotomayor as a teenager » . In the lunchroom Sotomayor would ""hold court,"" various friends from her school years told CNN, sharing opinions on policies and social problems. She even led discussions around her home, an apartment in the sprawling 28-building Bronxdale Housing project that was so rife with drugs and crime that police often locked it down on Saturday nights, Sotomayor said in one speech. If she is confirmed by the full Senate Sotomayor, now 55, would be the first Latina Supreme Court justice. President Obama has spoken of her ""inspiring life's journey."" Sotomayor's 1972 graduating class knew they were a generation facing ""change,"" said Jeri Faulkner, who was a freshman when Sotomayor was a senior. It was a time when the Vietnam War and social and economic strife were in the news daily. ""There was a lot of change and turmoil, and they were very involved in it -- very, very involved in social issues; very, very ready to change the world,"" Faulkner, now Cardinal Spellman's Dean of Students, said of Sotomayor's class. ""And Sonia, she was at the forefront of those discussions."" A fixture on the debate team and in student government, Sotomayor was even a part of change inside Cardinal Spellman -- helping to write a unified constitution when male and female classes merged in 1971. Outside school, Sotomayor spent some vacations working at the United Bargains store in the Bronx, though she has admitted she was too young for a job. She also worked.with her mother at Prospect Hospital.  See photos of Sotomayor throughout her life » . Hard work was a fixture of the Sotomayor household. Juan Sotomayor, Sonia's father, died when she was 9, leaving her mother, Celina, to fend for Sonia and her younger brother, also named Juan. Celina Sotomayor started at the hospital as a telephone operator and later became a registered nurse. She worked long hours to earn enough to send her children to better schools like Cardinal Spellman, which now boasts of its graduate with a banner on its pale brick facade. And she used spare money to buy the neighborhood's only encyclopedia. Sonia's mother was clear in what she expected from her daughter, said Valdespino-Torres. When she got home from work and stepped into the brick building, she always asked Sonia if she had done her homework, food shopping or laundry. ""Only then, Sonia would be allowed to go out,"" Valdespino-Torres said.  Watch Valdespino-Torres take a walk around the girls' old haunts » . ""Going out"" sometimes meant reading for grade-schooler Sonia Sotomayor. She turned to books for solace after her father died -- a loss that came a year after she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. She has needed daily insulin injections ever since. But sorrow and challenges were not something she shared, Valdespino-Torres said: ""That must have been very difficult at her age to deal with, and it was something that just never really came up. She took care of it and she dealt with it."" Sotomayor swapped Nancy Drew mysteries with her friends and loved talking about them, Valdespino-Torres said. Later she would become engrossed in ""Perry Mason"" and the workings of courts.  Watch Juan Sotomayor say how his sister forced him to watch 'Mason' » . In the summer, Sotomayor and Valdespino-Torres would sit on the stone steps of Blessed Sacrament -- Sotomayor's Catholic grade school. Their parents kept watch from two-story duplex houses and through the black, steel bars of public housing apartment windows as the girls listened for hours to the latest vinyl records -- The Four Tops, The Rascals, The Beatles and Frankie Valli. Sotomayor even coaxed some girlfriends to play baseball -- almost in the shadow of Yankee Stadium. (Many years later, Sotomayor would make a famous ruling that effectively ended the Major League Baseball strike.) Sotomayor also spent time with her cousins, who lived in now-dilapidated apartments marred by broken windows. Entertainment might have been their grandmother calling bingo as they marked their cards with chickpeas. It was with her cousins that Sotomayor embraced her Puerto Rican roots, she has said. The neighborhood still boasts a heavy Latino population -- with many Puerto Rican flags in windows. Sotomayor says the sights and sounds of the neighborhood have stayed with her: salsa beats and laughter from Saturday movies featuring Mexican comedian Cantinflas. The Bronx streets around Southern Boulevard were the center of young Sotomayor's world, but her curiosity was sparked by the No. 5 train creaking along tracks visible from her grandmother's window. At first she just made faces at riders, she has said, but then she began to wonder where the people were going. Sotomayor's childhood friends say now that they knew even then that she would someday be one of those people going places.  See how Sotomayor is similar to the Supreme Court justices » . ""Especially because of her pure intelligence, her work ethic, her seriousness and focus,"" Procidano said. ""You kind of visualize a certain trajectory for people, and you say with Sonia, 'Well, I'm not surprised. Isn't that where she was going?'"" Faulkner, her high school classmate, added: ""I saw her as leader, for sure ... They were teenage attributes at the time, but they were there. All of those little things that make her able to do this job, or be able to handle this pressure, it was there. It was in her from the beginning.""","Sonia Sotomayor grew up in crime-ridden Bronx neighborhood .

"(CNN) -- Scotland's Susan Boyle gives new meaning to the term ""overnight sensation."" The ""Britain's Got Talent"" contestant was expected to be something of a joke when she first sauntered on stage, but she absolutely wowed the audience, the judges -- and then the world via the Internet -- with her stunning rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream."" Along with Simon Cowell and Piers Morgan, Amanda Holden is a judge on ""Britain's Got Talent."" But like others who stumble upon sudden fame, she found the pressure and scrutiny to be overwhelming. ""Talent"" judge Amanda Holden and Dr. Drew Pinsky of VH1's ""Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew"" joined CNN's Larry King Tuesday night to discuss Boyle's hospitalization for stress and the toll the spotlight and media criticism might have taken on her mental health. They also discussed whether Boyle will develop the emotional stamina for a high-pressure singing career. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: What do we know right now? Amanda Holden: Basically, we've spoken to Susan's brother. He, in fact, spoke on [CBS' ""The Early Show""] this morning to say that his sister was very keen to come home as soon as she possibly could and that she was resting up in a clinic in London and that she was very much looking forward to coming out and seeing what was available to her when she felt better. King: Is the show, Amanda, paying for the hospital bills and are they taking care of her? Holden: I have no idea if they're paying the hospital bills. I would imagine that they are. We're a very loyal show. We love Susan very much. In fact, all the contestants that appear on our show are extraordinarily well looked after. King: Your fellow judge, Piers Morgan, has said that there was talk of taking her off the show because of all the pressures on her. Were you involved? Were there any discussions like that? Holden: I wasn't involved in any discussions like that. And I think Piers has a slightly closer relationship with her.  ... The only thing I'm worried about with Susan Boyle is that she seems to have a crush on Piers Morgan. ... I think that Piers kind of reassured her during the final that she was doing well and that she mustn't pay any kind of attention to the press and all the other stuff that was going . King: Despite all the tumult, there's no disputing that Susan sang her heart out during the finale of the competition. I know the dance troupe [Diversity] was terrific. But, frankly, why didn't she win? Holden: Honestly, I can't criticize the decision because it was the British public that voted in the end. I have no real idea, to be honest. I wonder whether it could be that Diversity was utterly fantastic on the show that night. They decimated the show. They really, really were amazing. And I just wonder whether maybe younger people voted and were quicker on the texts than the kind of people that were voting for Susan. But as I keep saying, if Susan is a loser, then surely she is the biggest and best loser that we have in the world. And coming second is no bad thing.  Watch Amanda Holden discuss Susan Boyle » . King: She came in, though, [as] a small-town amateur singer, [with] learning disabilities due to suffering oxygen deprivation at birth. Some say the program exploited her and her vulnerabilities. Do you agree? Holden: I couldn't disagree more. You know, she's a grown woman who applied to come on a talent show. She enjoyed every second of every moment that I met her or saw her behind the scenes. She was very excited. She was very proud to be taking part in the show. I think the downturn in press in our country [Britain], I think, maybe stressed her out a little bit. And I think she was just quite upset about all the exaggerated stories and the kind of falsehoods that were being written about her. I think that everybody gets upset about bad press when you're in this business. And she's somebody that's gone from anonymity to [an] absolute worldwide phenomenon. King: Yes. Holden: So how is she expected to handle that? Nobody can handle that with the best will in the world. I've been in the business 15 years, and I'm still not media savvy. [Dr. Drew Pinsky joins the show] . King: What do you make of this Susan Boyle thing? Pinsky: The problem here is that here's a woman that's suddenly under the scrutiny of the spotlight who maybe has some  developmental issues, who is under tremendous stress and [now] is in a psychiatric hospital. The question is, did the show harm her? King: Did it? Pinsky: It's hard to say. This is the first time these kind of experiences have really been undertaken by people. People that come out of nowhere all of a sudden are international superstars. King: Should we be, Amanda, concerned about that? Holden: First of all, I just want to say that Susan's brother said on British television this morning that, yes, Susan has experienced learning difficulties. But in actual fact, when she was at school, she did as well as any of her other siblings. But throughout her childhood, always before an exam or anything else, she always got quite anxious. [Before the show], she was feeling nervous. But she went out there and she nailed it. You know, she did the best performance that we've seen. And let's not forget, this is actually only the second or third time we've heard her sing. ... She is in a place where celebrities go when they are burnt out. Now, I am obviously not a doctor. I have no factual information to give to you. I can only say to you her brother ... has said she wants to come home within a matter of days, rather than weeks. Pinsky: That's excellent. King: Would you guess, Dr. Drew, that she still has a career in front of her? Wouldn't you bet she does? Pinsky: Oh, I bet she does, absolutely. And she will learn to become accustomed to this kind of stress, I am sure. But let's make sure she has the care she needs. And let's be sure that ... everybody that goes on shows like this has access to things that help them deal with the stress of these kinds of environments.","Amanda Holden: Boyle is ""a grown woman who applied to come on a talent show""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Newly released documents from Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor's service on the board of a Puerto Rican civil rights organization show the group opposed Robert Bork's nomination to the high court more than two decades ago. Judge Sonia Sotomayor is set to face Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Sotomayor, a judge on the New York-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, was nominated by President Obama in May to fill the vacancy of retiring Justice David Souter. Her confirmation hearings are set to begin July 13. She served as a board member of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund from 1980-92, leaving when she became a federal judge. During her years on the PRLDEF board, the group opposed President Reagan's 1987 nomination of the conservative Bork -- then a federal appeals judge -- ""because of the threat he poses to the civil rights of the Latino community,"" according to the documents. The group's attorneys prepared press releases and ""worked on numerous efforts to build coalitions against the nominee,"" according to the documents. Bork was ultimately rejected by the Senate. The Fund also met in 1987 with staff at the New York Daily News to address what it called ""negative images of Puerto Ricans presented by the News' staff,"" including well-known columnist Jimmy Breslin. Republicans are challenging Sotomayor's record on affirmative action, and the newly released documents on her work at the Fund will likely be a centerpiece of debate at the upcoming confirmation hearings. The 350 pages of documents released Wednesday by the Senate Judiciary Committee show the Fund filed hundreds of discrimination lawsuits over the years on behalf of Hispanics. The documents do not reveal whether Sotomayor was directly involved in them. She was a private attorney at the time, and was volunteering for the group. However, they reflect the Fund's strong push to establish a precedent of cases that would establish legal authority to uphold workplace quotas for minorities. One case dealt with promotions in the New York City Police Department. A May 1992 memo on ""litigation highlights"" noted, ""We obtained quota promotions for Latinos and African Americans to the rank of sergeant."" A PRLDEF class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of minority applicants claimed advancement exams were ""discriminatory and not job related."" The city settled, agreeing to promotions that reflected the percentage of Hispanic test-takers. Backpay and retroactive seniority were also provided. ""As a result,"" said the memo, ""almost 100 Hispanics were promoted, over twice the number that would have been promoted without the settlement."" Fast forward 17 years to a case Sotomayor heard as an appeals judge. She and her colleagues rejected a lawsuit by white firefighters in New Haven, Connecticut, after the city threw out the results of promotional exams because too few minorities qualified for advancement. In the case, one Hispanic and 19 white firefighters who scored high on the exams and would have gained captain and lieutenant positions claimed ""reverse"" discrimination. Last week, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the so-called ""New Haven 20,"" concluding ""the city rejected the test results solely because the higher scoring candidates were white."" Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority said, ""No individual should face workplace discrimination based on race."" The high court said municipalities would now have to establish ""a strong basis of evidence"" that promotion tests were unfairly designed or administered before nullifying them, and not simply because too many minorities did poorly. Sotomayor's views in the case have been criticized by some conservatives, saying it shows she supports racial preferences for Hispanic and other minorities. The high court dissent, however, criticized the ruling for reinterpreting what Congress intended. ""Congress endeavored to promote equal opportunity in fact, and not simply in form,"" wrote Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. ""The damage today's decision does to that objective is untold."" Supporters also contend the PRLDEF documents add nothing to the nomination debate. ""Documents that Judge Sotomayor did not write, or approve -- many of them more than two decades old -- are irrelevant to her nomination,"" according to a White House statement. ""The Senate should judge her on her own record -- especially her judicial record -- not on briefs that other lawyers wrote 20 years ago."" Opponents, however, claim Sotomayor's prior work for PRLDEF, and her off-the-bench comments reveal doubts about her fairness and impartiality as a judge. In addition, some Republicans on the committee expressed concern the material was released only 12 days before the hearings begin. ""This has all the hallmarks of a deliberate delay and an attempt to frustrate a thorough review of this important information,"" said Stephen Boyd, a spokesman for Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, ranking Republican on the committee. ""If these dilatory tactics continue, it will be increasingly more difficult for the hearing to go forward on July 13."" Sotomayor supporters point out a similar ""document dump"" by the Bush White House in the days before Chief Justice John Roberts testified before the Senate in September 2005. And the Bush administration also refused to turn over material from Justice Samuel Alito's prior service in the Reagan and Bush Justice Departments in the 1980s, arguing his subsequent judicial record was sufficient to determine his qualifications to sit on the high court.","Sotomayor once served on the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund .

"KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- An unopposed former Communist leader was elected Nepal's new prime minister Saturday, ending nearly three weeks of political uncertainty. Madhav Kumar Nepal waves at his supporters at the country's parliament in Kathmandu. Madhav Kumar Nepal of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) was the only person to serve as a candidate for the post after he received backing from more than 20 of the 25 parties in parliament. Nepal, 56, is a former general secretary of the Communist Party, but had resigned after the party made a poor showing last year against another Communist movement. In that vote, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) became the largest party, with 38 percent of the seats in the 601-member constituent assembly which also functions as parliament. Nepal had been general secretary since 1993 and served as the country's deputy prime minister for nine months in 1995. Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Maoist chairman, resigned as prime minister May 4 after the president overturned the Cabinet's decision to sack the army chief. Nepal became a republic last year. The new government has two important tasks before it: the writing of a new constitution within a year, and integration of 19,600 Maoist combatants into the security forces. Without the support of the former Maoist rebels, these tasks cannot be achieved. The Maoists fought a 10-year insurgency aimed at abolishing the monarchy.","Madhav Kumar Nepal of the Communist Party of Nepal was only candidate .

"(CNN)  -- Police are investigating whether or what family issues  might have prompted a California man to shoot six of his family members -- killing five -- before committing suicide. His wife was critically wounded. Authorities on Tuesday said Devan Kalathat, 42, shot his family Sunday night at his Santa Clara townhouse, killing two adults and three children. Kalathat killed his 11-year-old son, Akhil Dev; his 4-year-old daughter, Negha Dev; his 35-year-old brother-in-law Ashok Appu Poothemkandi; Poothemkandi's 25-year-old wife, Suchitra Sivaraman; and the couple's 11-month-old daughter, Ahana. Kalathat's 34-year-old wife, who was not identified, sustained multiple gunshot wounds and remains in critical condition, said Lt. Phil Cooke. ""Family dynamics and personal relationships may have played a factor,"" Cooke told reporters Tuesday. He said Kalathat was employed as an engineer and nothing indicated he was facing ""layoff or financial crisis."" Investigators believe Kalathat used two .45-caliber semi-automatic pistols, both of which he owned. Cooke said Kalathat bought one of the pistols in February and the other nearly two weeks ago -- roughly the same time his wife's brother, Poothemkandi, arrived in California from India with Suchitra Sivaraman and Ahana. Cooke noted that Poothemkandi was an ""educated professional"" with plans to stay in the Bay Area to work on a project for a high-tech firm. Police were called after a neighbor noticed Kalathat's wounded wife outside the home around 8:30 p.m. (11:30 p.m. ET), Cooke said. When police arrived, other victims were found around the kitchen and dining room in what Cooke described as ""a very gruesome scene.""

"QUEENS, New York (CNN) -- For Victor Guevares, winning a bid at a raucous foreclosure auction two months ago was just the first step toward achieving his dream of home ownership. And after getting through several obstacles along the way, he finally moved his family into the two-story, three-bedroom house in Queens. Victor Guevares, second from right, bought a home at a raucous foreclosure auction two months ago. The auction process isn't as easy as it looks, Guevares said. ""If you're going to an auction, do your research,"" he told CNN. CNN first met the Guevares family in March when he grabbed a home once worth $527,000 for less than half that price. Guevares had won an auction at USHomeAuction.com's foreclosure sale in New York. Banks and other lenders were unloading foreclosed houses, and many were selling at 50 percent to 60 percent below their highest values. Foreclosures skyrocketed in March and the first quarter of 2009 to their highest levels on record as banks lifted moratoria on filings. Foreclosure filings -- which include default papers, auction sale notices and repossessions -- reached 803,489 in the first quarter, according to a recent report by RealtyTrac, an online marketer of foreclosed properties.  Watch Victor Guevares give a quick tour of his new home » . That is a 24 percent jump over a year earlier and a 9 percent increase compared to the previous quarter. Of those first-quarter filings, 341,180 happened in March, a 17 percent increase from February and a 46 percent jump from March 2008. Sitting with his stomach in knots on that March 8 afternoon, Guevares made the opening bid and kept pace until they passed $100,000, then $200,000. Looking shell-shocked, Guevares ended up with the winning bid: $230,000. But he soon realized there was much more to it, after plunking down $7,000 in auction fees and another $5,000 required from every bidder. And still, he couldn't immediately lock in a mortgage at the auction as he had hoped because records showed the home faced a possible code violation. ""I had a problem,"" Guevares said. An inspection cleared that hurdle, and closing day ended happily with Guevares holding the deed to his first house. But he wasn't through yet. Guevares, a married father of two, wanted to have his family moved in by the end of May -- and had his work cut out, since the home was split into two apartments. He broke down a wall, opened up a staircase, put in new floors, repainted and created a sunroom. All that work brought his cost to roughly $280,000 -- about $20,000 less than the estimated value of the home, he said. Guevares spent the past 12 years renting and trying to save for his first home, and believes he came out ahead with the auction win. ""I got a great deal on the house. My mortgage is $300 less than what I paid in rent,"" he said. The backyard is filled with garbage bags filled with debris, but the family was able to move in last week. Guevares' son, 8-year-old Devin, is reveling in his bright green room that has a window to peek out into his yard -- and the neighbor's. ""They have a dog named Rocky, just the same as the dog we have,"" he said. Another perk: no more worrying about being quiet as he did at their apartment. ""I can just scream,"" said Devin.","Victor Guevares won bid at a raucous foreclosure auction two months ago .

"The U.N. Security Council and U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday called for both sides in Sri Lanka's civil war to protect civilians and allow humanitarian aid into the conflict zone, where tens of thousands are trapped. President Obama criticized the Tamil Tigers for using civilians as ""human shields."" In a statement at the White House, Obama urged Sri Lankan government troops to halt the ""indiscriminate"" shelling of civilians trapped with the remnants of the country's Tamil Tiger rebels and demanded the rebels stop using civilians as ""human shields."" Security Council members issued a statement demanding ""that all parties respect their obligations under international humanitarian law."" Though the rebels once controlled much of northeastern Sri Lanka, government troops have forced them from all but a small portion of the island since November. The remaining rebel force is pinned down on a narrow strip on the island's northern coast, but more than 50,000 civilians are trapped there as well, the United Nations estimates. Anna Neistat, of the New York-based Human Rights Watch, told CNN that both sides in the conflict are guilty of ""egregious violations"" of humanitarian law. ""I think the government claims that they're not using heavy weapons do not pass the laugh test any more,"" she said. ""Witnesses are telling us about the shelling. We also get photos of remnants of the shells that hit the areas."" U.N. spokesman Gordon Weiss told CNN on Monday that hundreds of civilians died during weekend fighting because the Sri Lankan army had put residents in the crossfire, and Obama and the Security Council urged the government to live up to its commitment to stop using heavy weapons. Neistat said at least 30 hospitals had been attacked in the conflict zone as well. Meanwhile, the Tigers -- who have been branded a terrorist organization by the United States, more than 30 other countries and the European Union -- are refusing to let the civilians who surround them evacuate, Neistat said. ""Witnesses are telling us that they were not allowed to leave, that those who tried to leave were shot at by the Tamil Tigers,"" she said. The group, formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, have fought for an independent state in Sri Lanka since 1983. As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began, and nearly 200,000 people are now sheltering in camps across the country's north. Obama called on the remaining rebels ""to lay down their arms and let civilians go."" ""Their forced recruitment of civilians and their use of civilians as human shields is deplorable. These tactics will only serve to alienate all those who carry them out,"" he said. Obama also said government troops ""should stop the indiscriminate shelling that has taken hundreds of innocent lives"" in recent days. A Red Cross worker was killed Wednesday during shelling in the conflict zone in Sri Lanka -- the third aid worker killed in six weeks -- the International Committee of the Red Cross said. The fighting between the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tigers has intensified in the conflict area to the point that the Red Cross cannot get food to that area or help the sick and wounded, said Sarasi Wijeratne, a Red Cross spokeswoman. ""Without urgent action, this humanitarian crisis could turn into a catastrophe,"" Obama said. ""Now's the time, I believe, to put aside some of the political issues that are involved and to put the lives of the men and women and children who are innocently caught in the crossfire, to put them first.""","NEW: Security Council demands all parties respect international humanitarian law .

"(CNN) -- They were taken before Marilyn Monroe became branded as the voluptuous blonde who oozed sex appeal in dozens of Hollywood films. A 24-year-old Marilyn Monroe poses for Life magazine in August 1950. They were taken before rumors of an affair with President John F. Kennedy swirled and her mental breakdowns became public. They were taken before the beautiful actress's mysterious overdose that resulted in her death at the age of 36. In a collection discovered by Life.com last month, unpublished photographs of Monroe reveal a softer, more innocent 24-year-old budding starlet in a more peaceful time, before her fame peaked. Her flawless face bears a natural look with minimal makeup, unusual for the star, who was often glamorized in photo shoots with lipstick, designer dresses and expensive jewelry. Monday would have been Monroe's 83rd birthday. In one photo, the young Monroe lies in bliss, reading on a park bench, which editors at Life.com believe was shot at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, California. In another, her face is serene as she is perched over a bridge barefoot. The shoot, which dates to 1950, was conducted by Life photographer Ed Clark. It's a side of Monroe that the American public has rarely seen. ""She hasn't really exploded as a star, yet she was on the brink of something big,"" says Dawnie Walton, deputy editor at Life.com, a Web site harboring more than 7 million Life magazine photographs. The site was launched in March. ""I was amazed looking at her face. Although she looks very innocent, there is something very ... sexy."" Last month, Walton stumbled upon the rare photographs while combing through the company's digital photo archives. Apparently, no one at Life.com even knew they were ever taken. Upon investigating the photos, Walton says, she found there were few notes left on the negatives. She says the photos were probably taken for a cover shoot that was never used. Monroe appeared on her first Life magazine cover in 1952.  See some of the previously unpublished photos of Monroe » . ""It just got lost and stowed away,"" Walton said. ""It was just ... somewhere in a warehouse in New Jersey."" At the time the photos were shot, Monroe had her first small breakout role as a mistress in ""The Asphalt Jungle."" The star was better known as a model at the time, though she'd had a handful of cameos in films. Photographer Ed Clark told the Sarasota Herald-Tribune a friend from 20th Century Fox alerted him that the studio had just signed ""a hot tomato."" ""She was unknown then, so I was able to spend a lot of time shooting her,"" Clark said. ""We'd go out to Griffith Park and she'd read poetry. I sent several rolls to Life in New York, but they wired back, 'Who the hell is Marilyn Monroe?' "" Photographs later in the 1950s and early 1960s would display a much more confident and sexual Monroe -- images that would become iconic in popular culture. There is the famous photograph of a busty Monroe in a white halter dress, standing with her skirt blowing up in 1955 for her role in ""The Seven Year Itch."" In 1962, American photographer Bert Stern shot a tipsy, sometimes nude Monroe in a series of delicate shots that would be known as ""The Last Sitting."" Monroe died about six weeks later, on August 5, 1962. Life.com staff members say there are 15 million photographs in the Life archive dating back to the late 1850s, even before Life officially began publishing in 1936. Two years ago, the publication began slowly transferring the photographs into a digital archive. From time to time, unpublished photographs will be found that the company doesn't know existed.

"(CNN) -- If there's a blessing in the current swine flu epidemic, it's how benign the illness seems to be outside the central disease cluster in Mexico. But history offers a dark warning to anyone ready to write off the 2009 H1N1 virus. The Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 sickened an estimated third of the world's population. In each of the four major pandemics since 1889, a spring wave of relatively mild illness was followed by a second wave, a few months later, of a much more virulent disease. This was true in 1889, 1957, 1968 and in the catastrophic flu outbreak of 1918, which sickened an estimated third of the world's population and killed, conservatively, 50 million people. Lone Simonsen, an epidemiologist at George Washington University, who has studied the course of prior pandemics in both the United States and her native Denmark, says, ""The good news from past pandemics, in several experiences, is that the majority of deaths have happened not in the first wave, but later."" Based on this, Simonsen suggests there may be time to develop an effective vaccine before a second, more virulent strain, begins to circulate. As swine flu -- also known as the 2009 version of the H1N1 flu strain -- spreads, Simonsen and other health experts are diving into the history books for clues about how the outbreak might unfold -- and, more importantly, how it might be contained. In fact, the official Pandemic Influenza Operation Plan, or O-Plan, of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is based in large part on a history lesson -- research organized by pediatrician and medical historian Dr. Howard Markel of the University of Michigan. Markel was tapped by the CDC to study what worked and what didn't during the 1918 flu disaster. Markel and colleagues examined 43 cities and found that so-called nonpharmaceutical interventions -- steps such as isolating patients and school closings -- were remarkably successful in tamping down the outbreak. ""They don't make the population immune, but they buy you time, either by preventing influenza from getting into the community or slowing down the spread,"" Markel said.  Explainer: Flu facts » . Markel describes a dramatic example in the mining town of Gunnison, Colorado. In 1918, town leaders built a veritable barricade, closing down the railroad station and blocking all roads into town. Four thousand townspeople lived on stockpiled supplies and food from hunting or fishing. For 3½ months, while influenza raged in nearly every city in America, Gunnison saw not a single case of flu -- not until the spring, when roads were reopened and a handful of residents fell sick.  Visit LIFE.com for photographs of the lethal flu pandemic of 1918 . Nonpharmaceutical interventions, or NPIs, also proved effective in big cities such as New York, according to Markel. In fact, the sooner cities moved to limit public gatherings or isolate patients, the less severe their experience tended to be -- as much as an eight- or ninefold difference in case and death rates, he says. Based on this guidance, the CDC preparedness plan devotes dozens of pages to potential NPIs, from voluntary isolation to reorganizing company work schedules to reduce the density of people sitting next to each other in the office or while riding trains and buses. If it seems odd to base medical strategy on 90-year-old newspapers, the approach is increasingly popular. ""There's a big case for looking at history,"" says Simonsen. ""We call it archaeo-epidemiology. You go to libraries and places like that, dig around, collaborate with people like John Barry and try to quantify what really worked.""  Map: where the flu is today » . Barry is the author of ""The Great Influenza,"" perhaps the signature history of the devastating 1918 pandemic. He says the historical record shows that isolating patients worked to slow the spread of flu in 1918, but that attempted quarantines -- preventing movement in and out of cities -- was ""worthless."" While Barry supports the CDC's general containment strategy, in the past he has publicly criticized Markel's work. After Markel's findings were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Barry wrote a letter in response, saying it wasn't swift action but rather an earlier wave of mild flu, acting like a vaccination, that was probably responsible for New York's relatively low caseload. In the letter, he noted, ""New York City Health Commissioner Royal Copeland did tell reporters ... that he would isolate and quarantine cases,"" but based on his own articles in the New York Medical Journal, he ""apparently never imposed those measures."" In response, Markel and CDC officials pointed to a decision by the New York Board of Health making influenza a reportable disease, and a 1918 JAMA article describing strict quarantine efforts in New York. Barry says both those sources rely on Copeland's assertions, which he considers unreliable. It looks superficially like an academic feud, but in this field, different conclusions can suggest radically different approaches to quashing a pandemic. Nowhere is this more true than in research that builds computer models to predict the spread of outbreaks, based on previous ones. Markel, along with most analysts, says that in prior pandemics, the so-called R-naught number -- the number of new infections caused by each infected person -- has been approximately 2.0. The current U.S. pandemic control strategy is based on computer simulations that assume a flu virus with an R-naught between 1.6 and 2.4. Last year, however, Simonsen and Viggo Andreasen concluded that the true R-naught of the 1918 flu virus was probably somewhere between 3 and 4. Since an epidemic grows exponentially -- each person sickens three others, each of whom infects three more, and so on -- this is a tremendous difference. ""It says it's going to be harder than we thought"" to control a pandemic, Simonsen says. Barry agrees. ""I do think that some of these things, like isolating [sick people], will take off some of the edge. We hope they'll do more than that. But to think they'll stop a pandemic, that is just not going to happen."" Simonsen says control measures such as the steps taken by Mexico in recent days -- closing schools and restaurants, for example -- are still worth the effort. ""It doesn't mean we should give up, because we don't know the R-naught [for swine flu]. We don't know how easily this spreads."" But she adds, NPIs are at best a way to buy time. ""We just badly need a vaccine. That's the most important thing."" To date, the CDC has emphasized personal protective steps such as washing hands and using hand gels, as opposed to tightening border controls or issuing formal directives to close schools or limit public gatherings. Such steps have been left to state and local officials, who have responded in a variety of ways. One reason for the delay in stronger guidelines is that swine flu caught planners off guard; they had anticipated being able to recognize a pandemic overseas, weeks or at least days before it hit the United States. At the same time, CDC acting director Dr. Richard Besser said Thursday that it's important to let officials tailor their response to local conditions. ""They can take the recommendations we're providing and apply them locally. [By doing that] we hope to learn and see what are the most effective control strategies."" Markel agrees that the best response depends on the particular situation. ""History is not predictive science. And the powers of public health officials [in 1918] were much greater. Another difference is that people's trust of doctors and government in 1918 was probably remarkably different.... But what I have found, studying epidemics, is that good planning and good relationships between local state and federal authorities, goes a long way.""","CDC's national pandemic strategy rooted in lessons of past epidemics .

"ATHENS, Georgia (CNN) -- Over the railroad tracks, near Agriculture Drive on the University of Georgia campus, sits a unique machine that may hold one of the solutions to big environmental problems like energy, food production and even global climate change. Biochar's high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes. ""This machine right here is our baby,"" said UGA research engineer Brian Bibens, who is one of a handful of researchers around the world working on alternative ways to recycle carbon. Bibens' specialty is ""biochar,"" a highly porous charcoal made from organic waste. The raw material can be any forest, agricultural or animal waste. Some examples are woodchips, corn husks, peanut shells, even chicken manure. Bibens feeds the waste -- called ""biomass"" -- into an octagonally shaped metal barrel where it is cooked under intense heat, sometimes above 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, the organic matter is cooked through a thermochemical process called ""pyrolysis"". In a few hours, organic trash is transformed into charcoal-like pellets farmers can turn into fertilizer.  Gasses given off during the process can be harnesed to fuel vehicles of power electric generators.  Watch how biochar is made and why it's important » . Biochar is considered by many scientists to be the ""black gold"" for agriculture. Its high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes and ultimately increase crop yields while acting as natural carbon sink - sequestering CO2 and locking it into the ground. Biochar helps clean the air two ways: by preventing rotting biomass from releasing harmful CO2 into the atmosphere, and by allowing plants to safely store CO2 they pull out of the air during photosynthesis.  See more about how biochar works » . ""Soil acts as an enormous carbon pool, increasing this carbon pool could significantly contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere,"" said Christoph Steiner, one of the leading research scientist studying biochar. ""It gives us a chance to produce carbon negative energy."" Worldwide use of biochar could cut CO2 levels by 8 parts per million within 50 years, according to NASA scientist James Hansen. Global carbon levels in the air have been steadily increasing at an alarming rate since the 1980s, according to NOAA. Since 2000, increases of 2 parts per million of CO2 have been common, according to NOAA. During the 1980s rates increased by 1.5 ppm per year. The process of making biochar can also lead to other valuable products. Some of the gases given off during the process can be converted to electricity, others can be condensed and converted to gasoline, and there are also some pharmaceutical applications for the by-products, said Danny Day President and CEO of Eprida, a private firm in Athens, Georgia currently exploring industry applications for the biochar process. Although scientists look to biochar to improve the future, its origin lies in the past. For centuries indigenous South Americans living in the Amazon Basin used a combination of charred animal waste and wood to make ""terra preta,"" which means black earth, in Portuguese. Thousands of years later, the terra preta soil remains fertile without need for any added fertilizer, experts say. ""These terra preta soils are older than 500 years and they are still black soil and very rich in carbon,"" said Steiner, a professor at the University of Georgia. Reducing the need for deforestation to create more cropland. By using biochar concepts, terra preta soils have been proven to remain fertile for thousands of years, preventing further harmful deforestation for agricultural purposes. But still more large-scale tests need to be conducted before biochar technology can be rolled out on a global scale. Day says biomass -- that otherwise would be thrown away --could be developed into entirely new markets for biofuels, electricity, biomass extracts and pharmaceutical applications, in addition to biochar. ""We have 3 billion people out there who are at risk for climate change and they can be making money solving our global problem,"" said Day. Industries can now begin to look at farmers around the world and pay them for their agricultural wastes, said Day. ""They can become the new affluent.""","'Biochar' may reduce greenhouse gases, produce clean energy, help farming .

"(CNN) -- At least six people were killed Thursday when a powerful earthquake struck off the coast of Honduras, President Jose Manuel Zelaya told CNN en Español Thursday. Thursday's quake leaves part of a bridge damaged over the Ulua River in El Progreso, Honduras. Another 17 people were injured, said Jose Reyes, a spokesman for COPECO, the Honduran government agency that responds to natural disasters. Two of the victims -- a 15-year-old boy and a 2-year-old girl from Morazan -- died after a wall collapsed on them, Reyes said, adding that trauma was blamed for most of the fatalities. A 9-year-old boy died, and a heart attack proved fatal to a man from Tela, Honduras, the agency said. A woman suffered cardiac arrest. The 15-year-old boy's brother suffered minor injuries, said Dilcia Fernandez, mayor of La Lima, where the boy died. La Lima is about 120 miles (200 km) north of the capital, Tegucigalpa. Eighty homes were destroyed and another 175 damaged, including 16 schools, nine churches, eight public buildings, seven factories, three bridges, two hotels, a hospital, an airport and a potable water system, Reyes said.  Watch how the quake damaged a bridge » . The 7.1-magnitude quake, which struck at 3:24 a.m. and was centered about 200 miles (320 km) north of the capital, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Half an hour later, a 4.8-magnitude aftershock hit about 155 miles (250 km) north of Tegucigalpa. Zelaya said the June 2-3 meeting of the Organization of American States will be held as planned in nearby San Pedro Sula, where he said one building had been damaged by the quake. The earthquake was centered, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, 27 miles (43 km) from Roatan, the largest of Honduras' Bay Islands and a popular destination for scuba diving and snorkeling. The area -- known for its white-sand beaches, clear waters and rich ocean reef -- is popular among budget-conscious travelers. ""People were startled. They started walking, running, doing everything they could to get to higher ground about two miles away,"" said Ron Cummins, who owns a resort there. ""I have been on the island for 14 years, this is the worst I have seen.""iReport.com: Did you feel the quake? Share photos, video . Ressie Bodden Saphrey said she was sleeping when her house started shaking. ""There was dark everywhere,"" said Saphrey, who works at a hotel in Roatan. Dishes and bottles crashed to the floor, she said. She and her 19-year-old daughter packed their passports, medicine, bottled water, canned food and a flashlight in case they were told to evacuate. They stayed inside their concrete three-story house, though many people in Roatan wandered the streets in the darkness, she said. A television station in Honduras, Channel 8, reported damage to several buildings. The Honduras disaster-response agency urged people to safeguard any important documents, and store food and water they could take in a hurry, according to Channel 8. Carol Frazier, who was vacationing in Roatan, said the quake knocked out power in her condominium and spilled water from the swimming pool. ""Everything was moving. The TV fell on the ground,"" she said. ""The difficulty was we couldn't even move. ""I really thought it was a tsunami or something. That was really our first concern,"" she said. ""We ran out."" Ron Bobbette, who manages a hotel in West End Roatan, said power had been restored in most places and panic was subsiding. ""Everything is back to normal,"" Bobbette said.

"(CNN) -- A man who landed a plane with the assistance of air traffic controllers after the pilot fell unconscious and died said Monday he was ""still in a daze of adrenaline."" Doug White said he is certified to fly a single-engine plane, but had no idea how to fly the large turboprop. ""I'm grateful, thankful to be alive,"" Doug White of Archibald, Louisiana, told CNN affiliate WINK. ""I'm glad my family is safe, but let's don't lose sight of the fact that a man died, and I don't want people to forget that."" White, his wife and two daughters were flying from Marco Island, Florida, to Jackson, Mississippi, on Sunday after attending a funeral for White's brother. White recalled watching and listening as the pilot, Joe Cabuk, conducted his ""climb checklist"" upon takeoff from Florida. After the checklist was complete, he said, Cabuk laid his book down. About a minute later, White told WINK, he looked at Cabuk, and ""he was just sitting there. He had his chin on his chest, looking down at his lap, but there's nothing in his lap that he needed to be looking at."" ""That's when I kind of looked at him for a minute, probably two, three seconds, and I touched him on the shoulder. I said, 'Joe! Joe!, and that's when his head rolled over to the side, and his eyes rolled back in his head, and his arm fell off the armrest ... and I knew if he wasn't gone then, he was in deep distress, but we were in trouble.""  Listen to White describe seeing the pilot's eyes roll back in his head » . The plane's autopilot was on, and the plane was at about 5,000 feet and climbing, White said. Although he was a certified single-engine pilot and had about 130 flying hours, he had no idea how to fly the much larger Super King Air two-engine turboprop plane. ""The only thing I knew how to do up there was talk on the radio,"" White told WINK. ""I've only been up there (in the cockpit) one other time. I made it a point to ask the pilot -- not Joe, but another one -- 'How do I talk on the radio?' and they showed me what button to push."" He told his daughters, "" 'Y'all go back there, and I want you to pray hard.' The wife kind of trembled and shook the whole time, and the youngest daughter, Bailey, cried and squalled, and the oldest daughter, Maggie, vomited and threw up three or four times."" Although White sounded fairly calm, some tension is evident on recordings released by the Federal Aviation Administration as controllers at Fort Myers, Florida, attempted to talk him through landing at the airport there. At one point, a controller asked whether the autopilot is still on or whether White is flying the aircraft himself. ""Me and the good Lord are hand-flying this,"" White replied. He described his mindset as being one of ""focused fear."" ""I had a 10,000-pound gorilla by the hand, and it wasn't wanting to cooperate,"" White recounted to WINK. Asked about his mindset, White said, ""I lost it"" after landing. His emotion can be clearly heard on the recording as he told air traffic controllers in a shaky voice, ""We're down, buddy. Thank you."" Air traffic controllers at Miami Center helped White at first, talking him through disengaging the autopilot, turning the plane and beginning his descent. They then handed the plane over to air traffic control at Fort Myers' Southwest Florida International Airport.  Hear audiotape of emergency landing » . It was a Fort Myers controller who called Kari Sorenson of Danbury, Connecticut, for help in talking White down. A veteran pilot and flight instructor, Sorenson is intimately familiar with the plane White was flying. ""We started providing him with positions of controls, switches, how to configure the aircraft for landing,"" Sorenson told CNN affiliate WTNH in Connecticut. Sorenson said he was told that the plane was down and that the controller would call him back. But he said he spent a few tense moments because he didn't know ""if he was down in a positive or negative way."" Sorenson credited the air traffic controllers for working as a team in helping White land. ""It was a team of people, and a good team at that,"" he said. ""The husbands and the wives of air traffic controllers have no idea what their spouses do for a living,"" White said. ""They have no idea, particularly in a busy airspace like Miami or Fort Myers ... they don't make enough money for what they do, the service they provide."" He said, ""when something good happens, (air traffic controllers) don't get the high five and the 'attaboys.' I'm gonna give them the attaboy, and I'm going to send them all notes."" He said he would also send them restaurant gift certificates so they can take their friends or family out to dinner. But while he is grateful, White said, he is also saddened at Cabuk's death. ""Joe Cabuk was a father, he was a husband, he was a grandpa, he was a pro at what he did, he was a Christian, he was a great guy and he loved to fly ... this is not all about me. Joe Cabuk died."" The cause of Cabuk's death has not been released. The Federal Aviation Administration has not given any of the involved air traffic controllers permission to speak about the incident.","Pilot Joe Cabuk went unconscious at the controls during a flight from Florida .

"(CNN) -- From supermarkets to the office supply store, it's hard to miss those tiny bottles of 5-hour Energy. The makers of 5-Hour Energy call it a ""no-nonsense drink."" ""It would be easier for me to tell you where we didn't sell them in the U.S. than list all the places we do,"" said Carl Sperber, spokesman for Living Essentials, the Detroit, Michigan-based manufacturer of 5-hour Energy shot. The small, shot-glass size bottles promise to provide energy and alertness without jitters to fatigued Americans. Unlike other popular energy drinks that market to college students, 5-Hour Energy's audience is multitasking, working professionals. The market demand has skyrocketed since the product hit store shelves in 2004. The company expects to move more than 350 million shots this year, Sperber said, up from 174 million in 2008. ""This is a no-nonsense drink,"" Sperber said. ""It is not a fashion statement. It doesn't have a cool name; it is just a simple grab-and-go product to help busy adults when they can't afford a letdown."" Each 2-ounce bottle contains zero grams of sugar, 4 calories and about the same amount of caffeine as a small coffee. It also contains about a dozen ingredients that are broken down into B vitamins (B3, B6, B9, B12) and what the manufacturer lists as an ""energy blend."" But don't expect superhuman results, one expert said. ""The B vitamins are given at extraordinarily high levels, and people need to know they are not some magic potion that's going to immediately raise your energy level,"" said Dr. Brent Bauer, Mayo Clinic director of complementary and integrative medicine. ""There is no data that show that."" The overall health impact of the shots' energy blend is a little fuzzy, according to some experts, because little data has been collected about the effectiveness or safety of the natural compounds. The blend contains: citicoline, tyrosine, phenylalanine, taurine, malic acid, glucuronolactone and caffeine. Phenylalanine, taurine, tyrosine are all amino acids our bodies naturally produce. Malic acid is a natural chemical substance found in food. Glucuronolactone is a byproduct of glucose produced in the liver. Citicoline is a natural compound that produces a chemical in the brain. ""These energy shots have over a dozen ingredients all together, and consumers are ingesting them at very high doses but there is no research of how the ingredients react all together,"" Bauer said. ""It's plausible if you put these 12 things together you will get a good result but it's also possible for them to cause major interactions to medications, or have a negative impact on the liver or kidney. We just don't know at this point.""  Watch Dr. Gupta talk about the the safety of 5-hour Energy » . Consumers of 5-hour Energy probably won't ever drink enough shots to reach toxic levels of the B vitamins, experts said, but side effects can occur. The maker notes on its Web site the potential ""niacin flush reaction"" from vitamin B3. It would be noticeable but temporary, one expert said. ""If you have too much B3 it can cause tingling in your whole body. You will turn red, flush, but it would only last for about 30 minutes,"" said Jim White, spokesman for the American Dietetic Association. ""Research also shows high doses of vitamin B6 can cause nerve spasm, also temporary trouble with muscle coordination."" 5-hour Energy's spokesman says that his company doesn't have safety data on the specific blend of ingredients in its product, but believes that side effects are ""rare."" ""None of our ingredients are synthetic drugs,"" Sperber said. 5-hour Energy also advises consumers to check with their health care provider before taking the booster. Medical experts acknowledged that if taken modestly, the products are unlikely to have a negative impact on health. ""In moderation, it can give you energy. But the problem is people drink coffee, then take these energy shots, then down Red Bull, take Hydroxycut, and it is just too much in the body at one time,"" White said. The makers of 5-hour Energy agree. ""There is no law against stupidity and there is always that person out there that is going to push the envelope and consume too many of them or combine our product with others, but we can't really control that,"" Sperber said.","5-Hour Energy promises energy, alertness without jitters to fatigued Americans .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- When Gregg Wenzel died six years ago in Ethiopia, the obituaries said he was a U.S. Foreign Service officer killed by a drunken driver on the streets of Addis Ababa. CIA Director Leon Panetta spoke Monday at a ceremony commemorating fallen CIA officers. Monday the public learned the State Department job was a cover for his real occupation: CIA spy. At a ceremony commemorating those who died in the line of duty, CIA Director Leon Panetta revealed Wenzel's affiliation with the agency and noted Wenzel was a member of the first clandestine service class to graduate after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ""He helped unite the class and kept its spirits high in the toughest moments,"" Panetta said. Wenzel left his job as an attorney to join the agency. He was 33 years old when the car he was riding in was hit by a drunken driver who to this day remains a fugitive. There are now 90 stars prominently displayed on the memorial wall in the spacious atrium of CIA headquarters, each commemorating an officer, like Wenzel, who died while serving the country. The 90th star was added recently, but as with most of the victims, the person's name and nature of service will remain unknown to the public so as not to compromise secret operations. At the annual memorial service attended by hundreds of employees, retirees and family members, Panetta paid homage to those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. ""Their patriotism and leadership, courage and decency are models for all of us,"" said the director, adding, ""their work is our work now. And their spirit abides with us."" Panetta also announced the beginning of a new tradition. Family members of the fallen officers will receive a replica of the star from the wall. The first star was given to the brothers of Douglas Mackiernan, the first CIA operations officer killed in the line of duty, shot to death in Tibet after fleeing China in 1950.","Gregg Wenzel died six years ago in Ethiopia .

Robert Hamlin Wainwright, 66, was arrested in the city of Zamora at the request of the U.S. Marshal's Office in Tucson, Arizona, the Mexican authorities said. He faces deportation.

He was tried and found guilty of firearms violations and was awaiting sentencing when he fled to Mexico, the EPA said. Wainwright, a convicted child molester, also faces charges of discharging a pollutant into Indiana waters. Mexican officials also announced Tuesday the arrest last month of a Canadian citizen on child pornography charges. According to the federal Secretariat of Public Security, Arthur Leland Sayler operated 36 child pornography Web sites in the United States and Mexico.

"(CNN) -- Entering his sixth year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter may not be able to see the finishing line, but he knows it's coming. In ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"" the trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione are on the trail of evil. In ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"" the sixth film in the Potter series, he's like a marathon runner who senses that he's got this course beat: He's still pacing himself, but there's a definite spring in his step. Potter's confidence seems to be a product of Daniel Radcliffe's authority in the role as much as anything. He's decided he's the hero of the piece, and he's happy with that; Radcliffe plays him with such implacable conviction and such lightness, it's becoming harder to worry about the character's plight. He can be reckless and impatient, but by now he's essentially untouchable. His chums may be prey to hormonal surges -- buckets of screen time is devoted to Ron's love life and Hermione's lack of same -- but our Harry stays focused. While Ron moons over his girlfriend, every night Potter takes a textbook to bed with him.  Potter 101: A guide to Harry Potter » . This battered book of potions comes with scarily insightful scribbles by a former student, the titular half-blood prince, giving Potter a distinct edge over his classmates and that increasingly conflicted bleached blond, Draco Malfoy. More important, it also gets him in good with this installment's designated dodgy faculty member, Professor Horace Slughorn. We know the drill by now: Slughorn has special knowledge that Harry must prize out of him, while the teacher's own leanings remain tantalizingly ambiguous. A special guest star in all but name, Jim Broadbent plays this mildewed academic with appropriately Dickensian panache and an undertow of sympathy (first spotted disguised as an armchair, the suspiciously solicitous Slughorn maintains at least one foot in the closet). Adapted by Steve Kloves and directed (like Potter V, ""The Order of the Phoenix"") by the efficient, self-effacing David Yates, ""Half-Blood Prince"" is as brisk and nimble as J.K. Rowling's two-steps-forward, one-step-back narrative stratagems allow. It risks annoying some fans by axing one significant character and a potential action show-stopper, but it's actually the overarching storyline that feels skimpy; the movie is replete with lovely, inventive design details and idiosyncratic effects work, while Yates' reluctance to pump up the bombast might be counted sweet relief after the latest bout of blockbusting overkill. iReport.com: ""Potter"" fans review the film . A trio of evenly spaced set-pieces do generate enough excitement to make this an iffy proposition for parents with younger kids; in particular Dumbledore and Harry's climactic cave expedition is an intense, nightmarish standout.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- An Iranian airliner that crashed Wednesday, killing all 168 passengers and crew, plunged into the ground and disintegrated on impact, according to a security official. Debris from the plane was littered around the crash site. Images of the crash site show a smoldering crater scattered with charred pieces of the plane and tattered passports. Ten members of the country's youth judo team were aboard the Caspian Airlines plane, said several sources, including Iran's Press TV. The government-backed network said the dead included eight athletes and two coaches. The plane ""disintegrated into pieces,"" said Col. Masood Jafari Nasab, security commander of Qazvin, the city nearest to the crash site in northwestern Iran. ""The aircraft all of a sudden fell out of the sky and exploded on impact, where you see the crater,"" a witness told Press TV from the crash site.  Watch images of the crash site » . The plane's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder have been found, state television reported late Wednesday. The crash was at least the fifth major airline accident in the world this year, following crashes of planes flown by Colgan Air, Turkish Airlines, Air France and Yemenia Airways. A US Airways pilot managed to land his plane safely on the Hudson river in New York City in January, with no major injuries, after the plane lost power. But aviation safety expert John Wiley said there is no reason to fear air travel in general, and no single airline or aircraft is particularly dangerous. The three most recent crashes -- in which a total of 548 people died -- involved different planes, flown by different airlines, in different stages of flight, he said. Caspian Airlines Flight 7908 -- a Russian-made Tupolev Tu-154M plane -- went down near the village of Jannatabad near Qazvin at 11:33 a.m. (2:03 a.m. ET) Wednesday, Press TV reported. Conversations between the pilot and the ground were normal and did not indicate any technical problems, the network's Web site reported, citing the managing director of Iran's airport authority without naming him. Some witnesses say the plane caught fire before crashing, Press TV said. The plane descended very quickly, Wiley told CNN, but it may have been circling, trying to land, rather than plummeting to the ground. Qazvin Police Chief Hossein Behzadpour and Mohammad Reza Montazer Khorasan, the head of the disaster management center in Iran's health ministry, both confirmed that all 168 people on board died, Press TV reported. The U.S. State Department, in a statement, extended its condolences to the victims. Department spokesman Ian Kelly said officials were working to determine whether any Americans were on board. Aviation analyst Kieran Daly told CNN that many aircraft operating in Iran are aging Tupolevs, some dating back to the 1970s. He described Tupolevs as ""workhorses of the old Soviet aviation system."" But he said the Caspian Airlines fleet is based on a slightly newer design, dating to the late 1980s and early 1990s. Pictures from the scene were ""consistent with a high-speed impact,"" he said. But he added that there could be large debris not seen on television, and that could change his analysis.  Watch Daly talk about the crash » . A team of investigators from the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee is flying to the crash scene to join the investigation, the agency said in a posting on its Web site. They will work alongside Iranian aviation authorities, the agency said. An agency official declined to comment further, saying the plane was operated by an Iranian company and nothing is known about it. A Tupolev representative told CNN the manufacturer will not comment until the aviation committee releases its report on the crash. The Tupolev 154 is essentially banned in the West because it does not comply with European noise and pollution regulations, but it has a safer-than-average accident record, Wiley said. Wednesday's crash is the first on record for Caspian Airlines, which was founded in 1993, he added. The Iranian newspaper Hamshahri reported that the plane was flying from Tehran and was headed to Yerevan, Armenia. The semi-official Mehr news agency listed the names of 153 passengers and 15 crew members. At least 42 of the names appeared to be Armenian, but it was not clear if they were from the former Soviet republic or if they were ethnically Armenian citizens of Iran. The plane crashed 16 minutes after takeoff, said the newspaper, quoting a spokesman from Iran's civil aviation organization.  See a map of the crash location » . That would have put the flight in one of the safest stages of travel, according to International Air Transport Association data. Only about 5 percent of accidents take place during the phase called en-route climb, 16 to 20 minutes into a flight, when a plane climbs to a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet. About half of accidents take place during landing. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad expressed his condolences to the victims' families, as did the European Union. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev sent his sympathies to the presidents of Iran and Armenia, the Kremlin said. Qazvin is the largest city in the province of Qazvin and is its capital, with an estimated population of 330,000. It is about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northwest of Tehran, the capital of Iran. The last crash in Iran involving a Tupolev plane occurred in 2006, according to the Web site airdisaster.com. That crash occurred on an Iran Air Tour flight from the port city of Bandar Abbas; it crashed and caught fire during landing, the Web site reported. Twenty-nine of the 147 people on board died in that crash. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr, Maxim Tkachenko in Moscow, Russia, and Ayesha Durgahee in London, England, contributed to this report.","State TV reports plane's flight data recorder, cockpit voice recorder found .

"(CNN) -- President Obama is not shy about showing off his jump shot on the basketball court, but on Tuesday night, it was his baseball skills that were put to the test. President Obama throws out the first pitch at the 2009 All-Star Game onTuesday in St Louis, Missouri. Obama, clad in a Chicago White Sox jacket and blue jeans, threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in St. Louis, Missouri. His low pitch barely reached home plate and the mitt of St. Louis Cardinals star Albert Pujols. Obama became the fifth president to throw out the first pitch at an All-Star Game, but the first in 33 years. He is following in the footsteps of Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford. Asked about plans to practice before the game, Obama said Tuesday, ""I want to loosen up my arm a little bit."" ""The last time I threw a pitch was at the American League championship series, and I just wanted to keep it high,"" the president said of his opening pitch at the 2005 Chicago White Sox-Anaheim Angels game. Aiming high is a good strategy, says St. Louis Cardinals scout Matt Blood, but it takes more than on-point aim to make the perfect pitch. ""Throw it with some force, don't lob it in there. Try to get a good downhill plane. Try to keep it in the strike zone,"" said Blood, who will be at the game Tuesday. HLN sports anchor Larry Smith, who has thrown out a few first pitches, says Obama has to be careful to ""not try to overpower it."" ""There's no speed gun on this. Just make it a nice solid throw to the catcher,"" Smith said. ""The one thing he doesn't want to do is bounce it home. Mr. Obama is pretty athletic, so I think he'll ace this."" Overpowering it shouldn't be an issue for the president, who joked Tuesday that he'd be surprised if his 2005 pitch exceeded 30 miles per hour. The president also needs to make sure he uses his whole arm, Blood said. ""You'll see a lot of people throw kind of out front. Their elbow will start out front and they'll never get their arm back behind their body, and won't get a full arm swing. It will be real short, and not very rhythmic,"" he said. Former Major League Baseball pitcher Jim Bouton said Obama's at the top of his game, and he can ""afford to take a few chances."" ""He should toss it a little further to the left. The righties are down by 15 runs in the ninth, they've got no team leadership. They're fighting with each other in the opposing dugout,"" he joked. All kidding aside, Obama should ""just go with his instincts, like any good athlete,"" Bouton said. ""You don't want to throw the ball into the ground or behind you, that's for sure."" Obama also doesn't want to do what Cincinnati Mayor Mark Mallory did in his opening pitch for the Reds 2007 season. He missed home plate by 30 feet. Video of the Democratic mayor's embarrassing throw has been viewed nearly 2 million times on YouTube. But the opening pitch isn't always a light-hearted moment. President Bush described his opening pitch at Yankees stadium during the 2001 World Series as ""the most nervous moment"" of his presidency so far. The game came less than two months after the September 11 terrorists attacks. Bush wore an FDNY jacket to pay tribute to the New York City Fire Department. He stepped onto the pitchers mound, and before a cheering crowd of nearly 60,000, he threw a strike. The crowded erupted in chants of ""U-S-A, U-S-A."" Before the game Tuesday night, Obama and all of the living former presidents will appear in a community service video. After the video is shown, Obama will take the field at Busch Stadium and greet the six St. Louis Cardinal Hall of Fame players. He then will throw his pitch to Cardinals' all-star first baseman Albert Pujols. Major League Baseball said the president will wear a specially made glove for his appearance, with a script Obama 44 and an American flag on it. The glove will then be sent to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. If Obama has butterflies about his pitch, Blood says the president should use the nervous energy to his advantage. ""For Obama, I'm sure he's dealt with much more pressure than throwing out the first pitch at a baseball game, but I would -- instead of seeing it as pressure -- I would think of it as an exciting opportunity and turn the nervousness into positive adrenaline,"" he said. CNN's Steve Brusk contributed to this report.","President Obama throws opening pitch at All-Stars game Tuesday .

"Editor's note: Janet Tavakoli is president of Chicago-based Tavakoli Structured Finance and the author of ""Dear Mr. Buffett: What An Investor Learns 1,269 Miles From Wall Street"" (Wiley, 2009), a book about the causes of the global financial meltdown. Her company is a consulting firm for institutions and institutional investors on derivatives, the securitization of assets, and mergers and acquisitions. Her firm has done work for investment banks but not for Goldman Sachs; she worked for the company in the 1980s. Janet Tavakoli says Goldman Sachs' record profits were enabled by the taxpayer-funded bailout. CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. announced record earnings Tuesday of $3.44 billion for the second quarter of 2009. Goldman's stock price leapt 77 percent for the first half of 2009, and closed Tuesday at $149.66 a share. Without an ongoing series of front- and backdoor bailouts financed by U.S. taxpayers, most of Goldman's record profits would not have been possible. In April 2009, Goldman Sachs' CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, who received record salary and bonus compensation of $68.5 million in 2007, said that bonus decisions made before the credit crisis looked ""self-serving and greedy in hindsight."" Now, they look self-serving and greedy with foresight. Goldman set aside $11.4 billion for employee compensation and benefits, up 33 percent from last year. That's enough to pay each employee more than $390,000, just for the first six months of this year. In June, Goldman bought back its preferred shares, repaying $10 billion it received from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, and setting it free of limits on executive compensation and dividends. But pay is not the key issue. U.S. taxpayers deserve a large cut of the profits, not the chump change -- less than a half-billion dollars -- they got from preferred shares in the company and the relatively small amount they could get from warrants in its stock. U.S. taxpayers should insist that a large part of Goldman's revenues and profits belong to the American public. TARP money was just part of a series of bailouts and concessions that allowed Goldman to prosper at the expense of a flawed regulatory system. In March 2008, Goldman, a primary dealer in Treasury securities, was among the beneficiaries of a massive backdoor bailout by the Federal Reserve Bank. At the time, Henry Paulson, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, was treasury secretary. In an unprecedented move, the Fed created a Term Securities Lending Facility, or TSLF, that allowed primary dealers like Goldman to give non-government-guaranteed ""triple-A"" rated assets to the Fed in exchange for loans. The trouble was that everyone knew the triple-A assets were not the safe securities they were advertised to be. Many were backed by mortgage loans that were failing at super speed. The bailout of American International Group, or AIG, ballooned from $85 billion in September 2008 to $182.5 billion. Of that money, $90 billion was funneled as collateral payments to banks that traded with AIG. American taxpayers may never see a dime of their bailout money again, but Goldman saw plenty. Goldman may be the largest indirect beneficiary of AIG's bailout, receiving $12.9 billion in collateral, including securities lending transactions, from AIG after the government bailed out the insurance company. The key question is whether Goldman asked AIG to insure products that were as dodgy as the doomed deal from Goldman Sachs Alternative Mortgage Products exposed by Fortune's Allan Sloan in his October 16, 2007, Loeb Award-winning article: ""Junk Mortgages Under the Microscope."" If the federal government had not intervened and if AIG had gone into bankruptcy, Goldman probably would not have received its $12.9 billion from AIG. U.S. taxpayers and the American economy are owed some of the bailout money passed directly through AIG to Goldman. Wall Street firms also reaped trading windfalls when AIG needed to close out its derivative transactions. This was the most lucrative windfall business in the history of the derivatives markets. When AIG left money on the table, it was U.S. taxpayer money. Goldman Sachs was granted bank holding company status in the fall of 2008. It already had the temporary ability to borrow from the Fed through the TSLF, which would have expired in January 2009. Now it has permanent access to lending from the Fed. Goldman can now compete with the largest U.S. banks and borrow money at interest rates pushed as close to zero as possible by the Fed. Goldman gets a further benefit: favorable accounting rule changes. In addition, Goldman issued $30 billion of debt with a valuable government guarantee that remains outstanding. Meanwhile, the American public faces a rising unemployment rate, falling housing prices, rising unemployment, higher local taxes and a dismal economic outlook. Interested men with reputations and fortunes at stake rode roughshod over public interest. The American public is owed part of the profits Goldman was able to make because of the largesse of our Congress. Wall Street's ""financial meth labs,"" including Goldman's, massively pumped out bad bonds and credit derivatives that have melted down savings accounts, pension funds, the municipal bond market and the American economy. Risky assets, leverage and fraud led to acute distress in the global financial markets. The biggest crime on the American economy may go unpunished with no consequences to the perpetrators. The biggest crime was not predatory lending, but predatory securitizations, packages of loans that did not deserve the ratings or prices at the time they were sold. They ballooned what should have been a relatively small problem into a global crisis. Wall Street owes the American public for its key role in bringing the global economy -- and in particular, the U.S. economy -- to its knees. Goldman is not alone in owing the American public. It is not the worst of all of the Wall Street firms. But among all of Wall Street's offenders, it is the most well-connected, and Goldman was the firm that cleaned up the most as the result of government bailouts. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Janet Tavakoli.","Tavakoli: Goldman Sachs reported record second-quarter profits .

"(CNN) -- Doctor James Braude leads a group medical practice in an elegant Atlanta, Georgia, office decorated with designer furnishings. It doesn't look like a charity asking for handouts. But it is asking. Obama, pictured July 1 in Virginia, has been touring the states to promote his plan to voters. ""On some days we've counted up to 30 patients a day who've lost their jobs and their health insurance,"" Braude said. So Braude and his colleagues offer as much free care as they can afford. The doctors have also begun discreetly inviting paying patients to contribute to a fund, helping more people get care they haven't got the money for. ""We're doctors. We're addicted to helping people. And when we can't, we go through withdrawal."" Millions of Americans have always gone without the kind of routine medical care that is seen as a basic right in many countries. The U.S. economic downturn -- meaning people lose health insurance when they lose their job -- and the election of President Barack Obama have coincided to increase both the need and the opportunity to address the plight of uninsured America. Obama's ambition is to provide insurance for the estimated 50 million Americans without coverage.  Watch why many in rural U.S. have concerns » . The insurance is expected to cover doctors, hospital care and prescription drugs. But just about every detail is still being negotiated so it's not certain who would be covered, what they would be covered for or whether people who don't want insurance would be forced to have it and pay for it. The plans that emerge could become the Obama administration's most ambitious domestic program and potentially a big, early test of his presidency. American medical care needs attention . Even though nearly 50 million of its roughly 300 million people have no routine health care, the United States spends more going to the doctor than any other industrialized nation in the world. Fully one-sixth of the economy is devoted to it. Under the current hybrid system, the U.S. Government pays for health care for ex-military, the extremely poor and the elderly. But the vast majority of Americans have to pay for their own health care and most do it where they work; many employers arrange health insurance and partly subsidize the premiums. The rapidly rising cost is crushing all kinds of businesses, from car companies to family farms. At the same time, hospitals and doctors say they are falling behind because the payments they receive from insurance companies aren't keeping up with their costs. ""Within a decade we will be spending one out of every five dollars we earn on health care,"" Obama said recently. ""In 30 years, it will be one out of every three. That is untenable, that is unacceptable, and I will not allow it as president of the United States."" The politics: Deep disagreement . There is a lot of disagreement about what to do. Congress has the job of actually turning the push for change into a functioning government program. Democratic lawmakers don't all support the president's plan or agree on how to pay for it. Republicans are split in a different way. Some lawmakers are trying to influence the Democrats' plans and others are proposing entirely different alternatives. ""If you look at their plan, it really is a big government-run plan that will take control of the delivery of health care in America,"" said Republican congressional leader John Boehner. His suggestion: ""Improve the current system so it works better."" The most profound disagreement centers on whether Washington should create its own new health-insurance concern to compete with the private companies that provide insurance now. Obama and many Democrats favor it; Republicans are dead set against it. Part of the problem is that insurance companies fear the government will put them out of business, by favoring or subsidizing its own scheme. The other part of the problem is more basic and ideological. The U.S. government already runs enormous health-insurance programs for the poor, the elderly and military veterans -- but many Americans see potentially mandatory government health-insurance as the foreign-born offspring of socialist states. The economics: More debt . Political opposition notwithstanding, the economics are going to be a problem too. Health care is a $2 trillion-dollar-a-year industry that would have to expand to cover millions of people who are now uninsured. The president has some ideas for new efficiencies but most estimates suggest the total cost of caring for Americans would rise dramatically. Washington is already carrying record debt and would have to find a way to pay for it. One assessment by the Congressional Budget Office of the Senate Democrat plan estimated it would cost more than $1 trillion over 10 years and only provide coverage for about 16 million Americans. There's also the possibility that the impact of reform on many employers and virtually every wage-earner across the country will have a spillover effect on the economy as a whole, still lodged in recession. The health care industry: Undecided . Then there is the place where the politics and the economy overlap: the health care industry. Doctors alone have spent roughly two-thirds of a billion dollars lobbying lawmakers in the last 10 years, according to the independent Center for Responsive Politics. Add pharmaceutical companies and hospitals, nurses and other health care professionals and you get one of the most influential forces in U.S. politics. They successfully organized to defeat health care reform when the Clinton administration tried it 15 years ago. The industry benefits from one crucial thing: Americans like their doctors. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released July 1 found 54 percent of people worry that their health care costs would go up if the administration's proposals get passed and only one in five thinks that his or her families would be better off under the Obama plan. With all that in mind, Atlanta's Dr. Braude says he's optimistic the reform can succeed. If not, he says, ""we go back to the same system and we have 50 million people without insurance, which means you are one brain tumor away from bankruptcy.""","About 50 million Americans are without any health insurance .
People losing jobs in the recession also lose health insurance .
Government health provision care largely confined to veterans, elderly and poor .
Extending government role is health care is politically hot potato ."
"(CNN)  -- It appears that Kevin Bacon was one degree too close to Bernie Madoff. Kevin Bacon and his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, had investments with Bernie Madoff, Bacon's publicist says. Bacon, the prolific actor, and his wife, fellow screen star Kyra Sedgwick, had investments with Madoff, the financial guru accused of swindling his clients out of $50 billion in a massive Ponzi scheme, Bacon's publicist told CNN Tuesday. Publicist Allen Eichhorn did not say how much the couple lost, declining to address reports that the figure was in the millions. ""Let's not speculate,"" he said. Dreamworks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg and a charity run by director Steven Speilberg mark some of the other Hollywood heavyweights allegedly bilked by Madoff, who remains in his Manhattan home on house arrest after posting $10 million bail. Bacon, whose credits include ""Mystic River,"" ""Footloose"" and the recent political biopic ""Frost/Nixon,"" has appeared in 64 movies or television programs since 1978, according to the Internet Movie Database. It's a career that spawned the parlor game ""Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon,"" in which players attempt to link any other actor to Bacon based on the massive number of co-stars with whom he has worked. Sedgwick stars in TNT's ""The Closer,"" and has screen credits that include ""Singles"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July."" TNT is a unit of Time Warner, CNN's parent company. Madoff was charged earlier this month with securities fraud in a scandal that has shaken financial communities around the globe. He is accused of running the $50 billion Ponzi scheme from his investment advisory business -- a scam that could result in huge losses to financial firms, charities and individual investors worldwide.","Bernard Madoff is accused of operating a $50 billion Ponzi scheme .

"(Mental Floss) -- From the moment Justice David Souter announced he'd be stepping down, Washington has been gearing up for a confirmation fight. But as Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told Judge Sonia Sotomayor yesterday, ""Unless you have a complete meltdown, you are going to get confirmed."" Robert Bork is not the only nominee who did not make it to the Supreme Court. Let's take a look back at eight nominees who didn't make it to the bench, at least on their first try. 1. Robert Bork . In our time, the most famous rejected nominee is Robert H. Bork, a legal scholar and U.S. Court of Appeals judge with a long paper trail of conservative opinions. Nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1987, Bork could have tilted the Court decisively to the right. As a known quantity, he was an easy target for liberal opponents, who organized a campaign against him. He was rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee after 12 days of hearings. Mental Floss: Washington's struggle to find a chief justice . 2. Alexander Wolcott . ""Oh degraded Country! How humiliating to the friends of moral virtue -- of religion and of all that is dear to the lover of his Country!"" the New-York Gazette Advertiser wailed in 1811 over President James Madison's nomination of customs inspector Alexander Wolcott. Wolcott's strong enforcement of the controversial embargoes against Great Britain and France cost him support in the Senate and in the press. The Senate turned him down by a 9-24 vote, the widest rejection in Supreme Court history. 3. Roger Taney . Roger B. Taney (pronounced tawny) is largely remembered as the chief justice who handed down the Dred Scott decision in 1857. With his sepulchral countenance, Taney is inextricably linked to the grim ruling that all blacks -- slaves as well as free -- were not and could never become citizens of the United States. But when President Andrew Jackson nominated him in 1835 as associate justice, opposition Whigs were still smarting from Taney's removal of government deposits from the Second Bank of the United States while he was a recess-appointed Secretary of the Treasury. The Senate voted to indefinitely postpone the nomination. However, after Chief Justice John Marshall died in 1836, Jackson sent Taney's name up again. He was confirmed, this time as chief justice. 4. Ebenezer Hoar . You might think the Senate just couldn't stomach elevating to the highest court in the land a man with the name Ebenezer Hoar, but it seems the senators were offended by something other than aesthetics. As President Ulysses S. Grant's attorney general, Hoar had insisted on rewarding merit rather than political loyalty, thus blocking a well-trod route for patronage. So when Grant nominated Hoar to the Court in 1869, miffed Republican senators gave the virtuous Hoar thumbs down. Mental Floss: What was Marbury v. Madison? Who were Roe and Wade? 5 and 6. Wheeler Hazard Peckham and William B. Hornblower . A senator has the right to reject a court nomination simply because the nominee is from the senator's home state. Upon this invocation of ""senatorial courtesy"" rests the demise of Wheeler Hazard Peckham and William B. Hornblower. Both men were nominated by President Grover Cleveland. Both nominees were New Yorkers, and New York Sen. David Hill invoked senatorial courtesy to squelch their nominations in 1894. (Peckham's brother, Rufus Wheeler Peckham, became a justice in 1896.) 7. Harriet Miers . Some nominees withdrew themselves from consideration before they could be rejected. Such was the case of Harriet Miers, whom President George W. Bush nominated in 2005, but withdrew under criticism that she was unqualified. Mental Floss: Why there's a Mohammed statue at the Supreme Court? 8. Douglas Ginsburg . Another withdrawal was that of Douglas Ginsburg (not related to current justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg), the conservative, former pot-smoking federal appellate judge who is a footnote in the Bork saga. After Bork was Borked, Reagan eyed the more moderate Anthony Kennedy for the seat. But Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) threatened a filibuster. So Reagan turned right again and proposed Ginsburg. But there was no getting around the revelation that Ginsburg had inhaled. Ginsburg withdrew himself from consideration, Reagan put forward Kennedy and the Senate, eager to move on, easily confirmed him. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"(CNN) -- After 40 years of appearing on the silver screen, actor Amitabh Bachchan is the elder statesman of Indian cinema and is possibly the most recognized man in India. The Big B: The patriarch of Indian cinema has appeared in over 180 films. Born to a famous Indian poet, Bachchan made his screen debut at the age of 27 and has gone on to star in over 180 films. As such an established star he has seen Indian film making change over the years, weathered changing audience tastes and the evolution of Bollywood cinema. ""I'm actually very happy with our content. Even though we were ridiculed, and the West were very cynical about the way we made our films and the content that it contained,"" he told CNN. ""But that very aspect has now become its USP (unique selling point) almost, and people love to see that. I would not want to change that. I would expect that this is how and what our cinema is all about."" If Indian films have gained a new found international interest, the way that Indian films are produced has also changed. From the industry's alleged connection to organized crime to better production quality, Bachchan has worked within the system and at the sharp end of making movies. ""We have our own modes of working and how does one actually decipher that the person that you're working with has some kind of an underground link? You know, 'I am mafia' doesn't come written on somebody's forehead. ""Whether he, you know, collects his money from wherever it is ... is really not our concern. We are interested the story, the concept, in our roles, the director who's going to be making it, in the creative aspect. That's it, "" he said. The role that propelled him to superstardom was of a working class hero standing up to oppression and injustice in the 1975 film ""Sholay"". ""During the 1970s there was a feeling of great dissatisfaction in the youth that the establishment of the system is not doing enough to take care of their issues and problems. When one individual stood out and challenged the system and came out victorious he suddenly became a hero,"" he told CNN. ""I fortunately happened to be the actor that they chose to represent that kind of philosophy or thinking. And therefore I became a beneficiary."" From being the ""angry young man"" of cinema in India he is now more commonly known as ""The Big B"" to the media and his millions of fans. But being such a public figure has never been a problem; Bachchan writes a daily blog and believes that it's in an actor's make-up to thrive in public attention and that stars should be able to deal with praise as well as criticism. ""I think we all live to be recognized ... creativity would be useless if no one ever saw it or recognized it. We want our work to be known. ""I enjoy my blog greatly because I invite comment. Not all of them are complimentary, many of them are abusive, but I never moderate it because I think it's important to know what the rest of the world actually thinks about you."" Taking the good with the bad, Bachchan was recently criticized for reportedly being less than impressed by Danny Boyle's Oscar-winning film, ""Slumdog Millionaire."" But says Bachchan the unnecessary controversy was because of comments from readers on his blog had been mistakenly attributed to him. ""I was wrongly accused. I did get to see the film. I thought it was a very well made film, great story,"" he told CNN. If ""Slumdog Millionaire"" illustrates current interest in Indian films by the West, Indian movies have also developed in ways more familiar to Hollywood movies. ""Life has become a lot faster. We've had to move with the times and adjust. If you were to analyze an indie film of the 1970s ... there would be far, far less editing cuts of, say, a film that was released in 2009. That philosophy [from TV editing], for some peculiar reason, has now translated into the minds of the audiences and they expect the same kind of treatment when they go out to see a movie,"" he told CNN.","Indian actor has been superstar of Bollywood cinema for 40 years .

"(CNN) -- Two tainted lots of a generic version of a drug reportedly taken by Michael Jackson have been recalled by the drug maker. However, no link has been established between the drug -- a powerful sedative and anesthetic called propofol -- and the singer's death. ""I have no way of knowing anything related to this specific product -- if it might have played a role or not played a role,"" said Dr. Arjun Srinivasan, the chief investigator on the recall for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency is not involved in the investigation into Jackson's death, he said. The CDC issued a health advisory Monday, saying two lots of a generic version of the drug had tested positive for endotoxin, a contaminant. The drug maker, Teva Pharmaceuticals, voluntarily recalled the lots. Srinivasan said the agency received 40 reports of patients around the country developing high fevers and muscle aches after being injected with the drug. ""All of the cases had high fevers, some muscle aches, headaches, but no issues with heart problems that we were told of,"" he said. Jackson died June 25 of cardiac arrest. The exact cause of death is pending toxicology results. All of the people who had taken propofol recovered; only one was hospitalized and that patient was quickly discharged, he said. But, he added, ""at high doses, endotoxin can absolutely cause lowered blood pressure and much more serious reactions."" ""It can cause decreases in blood pressure, which could precipitate problems with your heart."" The manufacturer, Teva Pharmaceuticals, is working with the Food and Drug Administration to determine how the contamination occurred and is voluntarily recalling the affected lots, he said. A spokeswoman for Teva said about 57,000 vials were included in the recall of the drug, and said the company had been contacted by the Drug Enforcement Administration. ""I can say the DEA did contact us about a specific lot number, and that lot number is not from the two we are recalling,"" said spokeswoman Denise Bradley. She would not say whether the contact was related to the Jackson investigation. A DEA spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times, citing unidentified sources, have reported that police found the drug Diprivan, a brand-name version of propofol, among Jackson's medicines. A source involved with the probe into Jackson's death told CNN that investigators found numerous bottles of prescription drugs in his $100,000-a-month rented mansion in Holmby Hills, California. ProPublica, an online news organization, first reported a possible link between Jackson's death and the drug recall on Tuesday. But an FDA spokeswoman denied there could have been a link. ""This is fever, chills,"" said Karen Riley. ""Does that sound like heart failure?"" She said at least three companies make the generic version of the drug and only one of them -- AstraZeneca -- makes Diprivan, the brand-name version. ""We don't know what was at Michael Jackson's house, but I'm guessing it was Diprivan because that's what the reporting has been,"" Riley said. ""This [the propofol recall] was endotoxin in the drug. It would not cause heart failure. ... It's unrelated."" Authorities have said the cause of Jackson's heart failure will not be determined officially until toxicology tests are complete.","NEW: DEA inquired about lot number not included in recall, spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President George W. Bush told a global climate change conference Friday that the United States will do its part to improve the environment by taking on greenhouse gas emissions. U.S. President George W. Bush Friday tells a global climate change conference ""we take this issue seriously."" ""We take this issue seriously,"" he said at the Major Economies Meeting on Energy Security and Climate Change, which the White House sponsored. In his address, Bush called on ""all the world's largest producers of greenhouse gas emissions, including developed and developing nations,"" to come together and ""set a long-term goal for reducing"" greenhouse emissions. ""By setting this goal, we acknowledge there is a problem, and by setting this goal, we commit ourselves to doing something about it,"" he said.  Watch Bush address the climate conference » . ""By next summer, we will convene a meeting of heads of state to finalize the goal and other elements of this approach, including a strong and transparent system for measuring our progress toward meeting the goal we set. ... Only by doing the necessary work this year will it be possible to reach a global consensus at the U.N. in 2009."" Bush said it will be up to each nation to ""design its own separate strategies for making progress toward achieving this long-term goal."" He said new technology, such as clean coal technology and biofuels, could help reduce greenhouse gases. He also called for more use of nuclear, wind and solar power. ""It was said that we faced a choice between protecting the environment and producing enough energy. Today we know better,"" the president said. ""These challenges share a common solution: technology."" ""We must lead the world to produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions, and we must do it in a way that does not undermine economic growth or prevent nations from delivering greater prosperity for their people,"" he said. ""We know this can be done,"" Bush said. ""Last year, America grew our economy while also reducing greenhouse gases."" If the preliminary numbers stand, it would make 2006 the first time in Bush's presidency that greenhouse emissions dropped. In prepared remarks this week, Assistant Secretary of Energy Karen Harbert said, ""Preliminary data for 2006 suggests an absolute reduction in energy-related carbon dioxide emissions of 1.3 percent for that year despite economic growth of 2.9 percent."" In previous years, the administration also has said its policies were reducing greenhouse emissions, but Department of Energy figures through 2005 show emission figures went up each year. The administration also said during those years it was reducing ""greenhouse emissions intensity,"" a term referring to the ratio between emissions and the size of the economy. The administration said the economy was growing at a faster rate than the emissions themselves. While the White House has taken heat for its environmental policies -- including from some Republicans such as Sen. John McCain -- Bush said at the conference Friday, ""By working together, we will set wise and effective policies."" He added, ""I want to get the job done. We have identified a problem -- let's go solve it together."" Other nations have been critical of the Bush administration's policy on climate change after the United States withdrew from the 1997 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as the Kyoto Protocol. That protocol, which was signed by more than 150 countries,  called on industrialized nations to cut greenhouse emissions in absolute terms. It did not make that demand of developing nations. The protocol expires in 2012. Representatives of 16 countries, the United Nations and the European Union are attending this week's two-day conference. The Bush administration has billed it as an initiative to develop a common approach to combat global warming following  Kyoto's collapse. At a Group of Eight conference in June, Bush pushed for a new framework on global gas emissions to counter the effects of global warming. Bush said he believes every nation should set its own goals. The president expressed concern that setting strict targets would damage the U.S. economy. Instead, he said, industries should enact voluntary measures. On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also told delegates to the global climate change conference that countries around the world must work together to combat climate change, much as they cooperate against terror and the spread of disease. ""No one nation, no matter how much power or political will it possesses, can succeed alone,"" she said. ""We all need partners, and we all need to work in concert."" Rice said the United States takes climate change seriously, ""for we are both a major economy and a major emitter."" In her address to the Major Economies Meeting, Rice said an integrated response, including ""environmental stewardship, economic growth, energy supply and security and development and the development and deployment of new clean energy technology,"" is the key to moving forward on the issue.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The House of Representatives voted Wednesday to give the Treasury Department the power to ban future ""unreasonable and excessive"" compensation at companies receiving federal bailout money. The bill would give Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner greater say on executive compensation. The Pay for Performance Act of 2009, which passed by a vote of 247-171, would empower Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to define what constitutes reasonable compensation, as well as to ban bonuses not based on performance standards. Geithner's guidelines would apply to companies receiving assistance from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. Democrats provided heavy support for the bill, with only eight from that party voting against the measure. Republicans, who are in the minority in the House, were mostly opposed, with only 10 crossing party lines to support it. Two weeks ago, the House passed legislation taxing individuals on any bonuses received in 2009 from companies getting $5 billion or more in money from the TARP. Bonuses for people with incomes over $250,000 would be taxed at a 90 percent rate, but the measure has failed to clear the Senate.  Watch Rep.

"(WIRED) -- In less than a week, Google announced an operating system to compete with Windows, while Microsoft announced that Office 10 will include free, online versions of its four most popular software programs -- a shot at Google's suite of web-based office applications. The fight between Microsoft and Google is over who'll be seen as the world's most important tech company. And not more than a month and a half ago, Microsoft unveiled its new search engine Bing, which it hopes will steal market share from Google and finally make it real money online. From the news of it, it's a full-blown tech battle, complete with behind-the-scenes machinations to sic government regulators on each other. It is, however, not a death match -- it's more of an fight to see who will be the King of Technology, since both companies pull in their billions through completely different siphons and are unlikely to severely wound one another any time soon. Google pulled in $22 billion in revenue in 2008, 97 percent of which came tiny text ads bought by the keyword and placed next to search results or on pages around the web. Google makes a negligible amount of money bundling its online apps for businesses, charging $50 a head annually -- but mostly it just gives its online text editor, email and spreadsheet programs away. By contrast, Microsoft sold $14.3 billion worth of Microsoft Word and PowerPoint and other business applications over the last nine months, making a profit of $9.3 billion. It made a further $16 billion in revenue in 2008 through sales of its operating systems, which range from XP installations on netbooks, to Vista, to Windows Mobile to its server software. Google now plans its own range of operating systems, starting with Android, an open-source OS for small devices like smartphones, and Chrome OS, a browser-focused, open-source OS that will run on notebooks and desktops. Clearly top executives at each company look over at the others' pots of gold and dream of ways to steal them, or at least make it harder for the other guy to make money. In fact, they even dislike each other enough to spend money to make the other one lose revenue -- take for example, Microsoft's behind-the-scenes campaign to scuttle last year's proposed Google-Yahoo advertising deal or its ongoing attempts to derail the Google Book Search settlement. But in reality, the competition is really about creating universes or ecosystems that it hopes consumers will want to live their technology lives inside. And it's about ego -- a fight to be recognized as the world's most important technology company. Microsoft would love for everyone in the world to be using its Internet Explorer browser to search through Bing to find a story from its MSN portal to email via Hotmail or Outlook to a friend. Add in a smartphone running Windows Mobile and an Xbox in the living room for the kids, and you have a Microsoft family. And though it is much joked about, Microsoft is the dominant platform for software developers of all types, whether they are making small business software, massive online role-playing games or photo-editing utilities. Google's ecosystem looks different. It starts with a Google Chrome browser (oddly running only on Windows) with a default homepage set to Google News or a customized Google homepage. From there you might go to Gmail and then click on a Word document sent to you as an attachment which Google will quickly -- and safely -- open for you in its online word processor. But most importantly, Google wants you to search and travel around the web, hitting web pages that run Google-served ads and Google tracking cookies. You might think that Google is a really cool company to give away all this free technology, while never thinking about the persistent and silent data collection Google is undertaking to profile you in order to deliver you to advertisers for a premium. So how do the two stack up in four key areas of competition? Browsers: Internet Explorer in all its variations still retains close to 70 percent of the market (depending on who is counting and how). That dominance remains, even though Microsoft's latest offering IE8 lags behind all the other major browsers in features and advanced web capabilities. Firefox, Opera, and Apple's Safari have all driven browser innovation over the last five years, but most people have not been convinced to leave IE behind, despite other alternatives being safer and more advanced. Why does it matter? Well, IE installations come with a default home page, don't they? Google's Chrome browser, on the other hand, is a handsome, whiz-kid of a browser. It's sleek and nimble, and it revolutionizes how tabs are handled. The address bar is the search box (Google as default, naturally). Each website opened runs as its own browser instance and has very low permissions to read and write to files. The sandboxing of tabs means that if a single website hangs or crashes, the rest are unaffected. Meanwhile, lower permissions make it harder for a hacker to bust into your computer through your browser. Chrome also has less than 2 percent of the browser market share. Online Search: Google's name now means search to most users. Google's search engine means money to Google. In June, it delivered 78.5 percent of search results pages delivered to U.S. web users. In the first three months of 2009, Google pulled in $5.2 billion in revenue, a majority of which came from AdWords, an auction-based service that triggers ads based on the keywords in a search query. Microsoft recently debuted Bing, a new search engine it hoped would fare well in comparison to Google. It's got some fine innovations, and shows the company is thinking very hard about better ways to present information to users by finding ways to synthesize data, rather than just retrieving links. Still, despite these improvements, a $100 million ad campaign, and generous press coverage that treats Bing like an underdog, Bing gained only a point in June to get Microsoft 8.2 percent of all searches. Operating Systems: Microsoft has been making operating systems since 1979 and has spent 28 years perfecting MS-DOS and Windows NT, the frameworks that Windows have been built around. Microsoft is estimated to run on about 90 percent of all laptops and desktops in the world. By copying its competitors' best features, leveraging questionable licensing arrangements and using its base of accustomed users to buy it time against innovators, Microsoft has held on to its lead in the OS market for almost 30 years. That's despite challenges from Digital Research, Apple and IBM. Microsoft's newest version, Windows 7, will be available in the fall. Early reviews say the OS boots quickly and sleeps fast, and avoids much of the confusing interface decisions that have made many dislike Vista, the successor to Windows XP. Microsoft also dominates in the business world, where nearly every medium to large company standardizes around Microsoft Office. Microsoft is also at work on version 6 of its operating system for handheld devices, which it first launched in 2000. Its OS advantages are immense. It has millions of users who know nothing else and who like Windows. There are millions who are attached to games or the thousands of desktop apps that are only available on Windows. Thousands of devices just plug in and work on its hardware. And familiarity with Microsoft software is a requirement for a huge number of office jobs. By contrast, Google first stepped into the OS game in 2007 when it announced its Android operating system for small devices. Google estimates that some 18 phone models will be running its system by the end of the year. Last week, Google announced, but did not show off, a new OS to compete with Windows, dubbing it Chrome OS. That name signifies that Google's OS will be for the web and browser-based. It hopes to convince developers to write software that runs inside a browser, instead of on top of the OS as developers for Windows and Apples' OS X do. It will also let web developers extend the power of their websites by expanding the capabilities of the browser, allowing websites to lean on the browser for storage and processing help. Advertising: Google is largely powered by its innovative auction-based text ads on its own site, but then expanded into serving ads on other people's sites with the Adsense program. It bought the ad-serving and behavioral-profiling giant Doubleclick in 2007 for more than $3 billion, and has ventured into mobile, print, radio and television ads. Microsoft has struggled to replicate Google's online advertising success. Despite owning MSN.com -- a portal that is second only to Yahoo as a destination -- Microsoft has not made money on the internet. To turbocharge its ad-delivery technology, it paid more than $6 billion in cash in 2007 for aQuantive, a full-service online advertising concern. Instead, Microsoft's online ad business lost $1.2 billion in 2008, double what it lost in 2007. The company expects 2009 revenues to be higher than the $3.2 billion it took in last year, but has not said it would make a profit. Contrary to what some might have you believe, the benefits of the Google-Microsoft competition are immense. Microsoft had largely grown complacent until Google came along to shake up categories. Gmail's massive online storage capability and fancy programming made Microsoft hustle to upgrade its popular, though not user-friendly, web e-mail service. Google Maps led to Microsoft's Live Maps, which now bests Google's efforts in some ways. Google has been winning the fight for the last few years, showing that it is still nimbler than the software giant from the Northwest. But the pendulum may be slowing, or even poised to swing the other way. With the innovations in Bing and the promise that Microsoft's online Office offerings will be free and more fully featured than the Google equivalent, Microsoft is taking on Google where it matters for users: on the field of innovation. And that will make for an interesting race, no matter which horse you prefer to ride. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

""He likes to look out the window when the plane takes off and naps the rest of the way."" Blame America's pet obsession, but in recent years, more members of the airline industry are embracing dogs and cats on board. Midwest Airlines may be an extreme example, letting select dogs sit in the same seats as humans, but other airlines are relaxing their pet policies by letting smaller cats and dogs come into the cabin area. About a year ago, Midwest began allowing certain ""celebrity"" dogs that appear in canine competitions, shows or advertisements to sit in seats. ""They are just passengers with four legs instead of two,"" said Susan Kerwin, who oversees the pet program at Midwest Airlines. The pet travel frenzy has spurred the creation of an airline catering exclusively to pets. This month, Pet Airways, the nation's first pet-only airline, will begin flying in five major cities, including New York and Los Angeles, California. It's an alternative to shipping larger pets in the cargo area of a plane, where there have been pet injuries and even deaths. Chart: Compare some of the common airline fees . ""The owners can check a bag with them,"" explained Alyse Tognotti, a spokeswoman for Pet Airways. ""Or if they have a special blanket or toy, basically anything that will take stress out of traveling."" On each Pet Airways flight, services include potty breaks and experienced animal handlers checking up on the animals every 15 minutes. Nervous parents can track their pets online. Southwest Airlines was the latest airline to join the pet-loving bandwagon in May, when it permitted small dogs and cats to travel in the cabin area. The pets must sit in an approved kennel that fits under the seat. ""I wasn't going to fly Southwest Airlines,"" said Katie Chapman, 37, of Louisville, Kentucky, who is mom to a friendly 18-pound Cairn Terrier that resembles Toto from ""The Wizard of Oz."" Since the airline has changed its policy, she plans to take her puppy on a Southwest flight to California this fall. ""I'm so glad now that she will be able to go with me."" Each year, airlines transport hundreds of thousands of pets in the cargo and cabin areas. Continental reported moving 270,000 pets last year in cabin and cargo, more than triple the number moved before the airline's pet program officially kicked off eight years ago. The Federal Aviation Administration doesn't have restrictions on whether animals can be in the cabin area, but airlines must allow service dogs for the disabled on board. Only cats and dogs are allowed in the cabin areas on most airlines. In the cargo area, other pets like rabbits, birds and lizards can be stowed. The cost of flying your furry friend ranges from $75 to nearly $300 each leg. It's a hefty price tag, but profit-bleeding airlines are happy to offer the option. Pets can even rack up frequent flier miles. After three flights with Midwest, the pet can earn a fourth flight free. Continental and JetBlue Airways' programs credit the pet's trip on the owner's frequent flier account. But one airline is catering to allergy-ridden customers who don't want pets in the cabin. Last year, Frontier Airlines banned pets from the cabin area because officials said pet allergies are common among their customers. Ann Kerns, a 63-year-old teacher in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, experienced continuous wheezing on a four-hour US Airways flight to Phoenix, Arizona. At the end of the flight, she was shocked to find that there had been a cat sitting under her seat. ""What would have happened if I went into an attack at 35,000 feet in the air?"" she asked. In 2008, the American College of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology wrote letters to Congress expressing concern about pets riding in the cabin area after some patients became ill from their flights. The letters didn't go very far, officials said. Airlines say they have had few allergy injuries on board. The airlines limit the number of pets in the cargo area to about five. The aircraft is disinfected and cleaned routinely, so dander and hairs aren't a problem, airline officials say. But not every traveler has had smooth experiences with pets on board. Terry Trippler, a travel expert, recalls an unpleasant incident years ago when a dog had diarrhea three rows in front of him. ""You could certainly smell it,"" he wrote in an e-mail. ""The only real way to solve the problem is no pets in the cabin.""","Most airlines allow small pets to ride in crates in the cabin for a fee .

"Editor's Note: This is the third in a five-part series exploring Judge Sonia Sotomayor's background and life with those who know her, and revealing the experiences that might shape her views as a Supreme Court justice if confirmed. Sotomayor won the Moses Taylor Pyne Prize, the highest honor given to an undergraduate at Princeton. PRINCETON, New Jersey (CNN) -- Sonia Sotomayor spent her first week at Princeton University obsessing over the sound of a cricket. Growing up in New York City, her only notion of this insect was Jiminy from ""Pinocchio."" She tore her dorm room apart looking for the critter every night. Finally, her then-boyfriend and future husband visited and explained that the cricket was outside the room, where she had been holed up most of that week in 1972. ""This was all new to me: we didn't have trees brushing up against windows in the South Bronx,"" Sotomayor recalled in a speech to the Princeton Women's Network in 2002. The freshman who was so taken aback by a cricket's chirping now has a more public challenge: Senate hearings on whether to confirm her as a Supreme Court justice, potentially the first Latina to hold such a post. At one time, being different may have been difficult -- for it wasn't just Princeton's crickets that startled Sotomayor. The academics and the students on the leafy Gothic campus, with its ivy-covered dormitories and castle-like towers, also made her feel out of place. Sotomayor, who was on a full scholarship, started ""a little more on the shy side,"" said Sergio Sotolongo, who attended high school and Princeton with Sotomayor. ""She did mention that, as a freshman, she felt sometimes intimidated by others and didn't really raise her hand very much,"" said Sotolongo, now chairman and CEO of Student Funding Group in Liberty Corner, New Jersey.  Watch classmates, professor remember Sotomayor » . As a first-year student, Sotomayor felt what she's called a ""chasm"" between herself and her classmates. She really only knew the Bronx and Puerto Rico, while her classmates spoke of European vacations and skiing. She said in 1990 that she felt she was a ""product of affirmative action"" and questioned whether she would have been accepted into the Ivy League using ""traditional numbers"" from test scores alone.  See how many of the Supreme Court justices went to Ivy League schools » . She would certainly have looked different to her classmates, with relatively few Latinos or minorities at Princeton during her college years. Even being a woman was different for Sotomayor's class -- the college had opened its doors to women three years earlier, but male students were still superior in numbers and (in some cases) attitudes. Judith Perlman, who lived down the hall, explained: ""I'd go to class and I would say things, and the professor would say, 'Oh, we usually express ourselves in a more gentlemanly fashion here.'"" Perlman and Sotomayor shared ""girl talk"" but about what they wanted to do with their lives, not about things like fashion, which interested neither. Academically, Sotomayor also faced a gap. She would later graduate summa cum laude and be awarded the top undergraduate honor, the Moses Taylor Pyne Prize, but she stumbled that first year. Peter Winn, who taught Sotomayor and was her thesis adviser, said her early writing reflected the fact that her first language is Spanish. ""She could be very assertive and very articulate, but not initially,"" said Winn, now a professor at Tufts University. ""Sonia was someone who entered Princeton as a young woman with enormous potential, and one of the things that happened at Princeton was, she learned how to fulfill that potential,"" he said. Nancy Weiss Malkiel, now dean of the college, agreed with Winn, writing in an e-mail that Sotomayor came to Princeton ""with high intelligence and great ability, but without a very sophisticated grounding in the study of history."" Malkiel, who taught history, said she worked with Sotomayor to develop the student's skills in the spring of her first year. Sotomayor also worked independently, spending one summer reading classics that were new to her, including ""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""Huckleberry Finn,"" and ""Pride and Prejudice,"" to attune herself more to the cadences of English, she has said. Despite the challenges, the young woman encouraged her friend from the Bronx, Sotolongo, who is one year younger, to enroll in the fall of 1973. ""In the end, clearly she was very happy to have gone to Princeton,"" Sotolongo said. And by the time Sotolongo began his freshman year, Sotomayor was showing off a new personality. ""She certainly opened up as she got her feet under her,"" said James Resnick, who also majored in history and is now a consultant at Keystone CompControl in Butler, Pennsylvania. With Charles Hey-Maestre, who was a year behind her, Sotomayor founded the student organization Accion Puertorriquena and by 1974 she was speaking out for the group in the Daily Princetonian student paper. The group helped to file a complaint with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, alleging that Princeton showed a ""lack of commitment"" in recruiting Latino students and hiring Latino faculty and administrators. Hey-Maestre, now executive director of Puerto Rico Legal Services in San Juan, Puerto Rico, said Sotomayor ""has the ability also that if she's feeling insecure about something, she manages it, and doesn't project it."" Latino affairs seemed to be an outlet for Sotomayor socially. Hey-Maestre said she was focused on her studies but went to some parties, especially Puerto Rican cultural celebrations. Otherwise, Hey-Maestre and Perlman remember, Sotomayor spent time with her off-campus boyfriend, Kevin Edward Noonan. They were later married, but divorced after seven years. Outside the university, Sotomayor volunteered at the Trenton Psychiatric Hospital as an interpreter. She talked at length with Sotolongo, while he was working on a project at the Trenton police department, about why youth got involved in criminal activities and how the cycle of recidivism might start and stop. ""Those were issues she was very concerned about, and I think in whatever circles she could, made those feelings known and expressed them,"" Sotolongo said.  See photos from Sotomayor's life » . Sotomayor's interest in Puerto Rican matters fed her as a history major. She wrote her undergraduate thesis on Luis Munoz Marin, the first governor of the island elected by popular vote. ""She was bending over backwards to be fair to points of view she didn't necessarily agree with,"" Winn said. The Sonia Sotomayor who went on to Yale Law School had matured, with classmates describing her as ""always willing to raise her hand,"" ""confident,"" ""outgoing,"" and ""one of the more outspoken people."" Read more about her time at Yale . She may still have been the girl from the Bronx, but she did not try to use her experience of hardship as leverage, said Stephen Carter, a Yale classmate of Sotomayor and now a professor there. ""She would never sit around and say, 'Oh, well, I grew up in a housing project so I know,'"" Carter said. ""She didn't feel her background gave her some kind of special trump. She wanted the argument to work. She would tell you why she thought something, and the 'why' never had anything to do with where she came from.""","Sonia Sotomayor arrived at Princeton in 1972 in fourth co-ed class .

"(CNN) -- Michael Jackson's upbringing was shaped by two very different parents. An image of Michael Jackson and his parents was on the big screen during his funeral in Los Angeles. His mother, Katherine Jackson, has been portrayed by her children as the loving glue that bonded the family together, while her husband, Joe, was the harsh disciplinarian whose iron hand not only shaped one of the most successful musical families in the world, but also elicited enough fear in his superstar son that it sometimes made him ill. Now the couple of 60 years stands at the center of a custody drama surrounding their grandchildren. Michael Jackson's will, filed in 2002, designated his mother as caregiver for Prince Michael, 12, Paris, 11, and ""Blanket,"" 7. It is the latest installment in the many trials that have tested the Jackson family, not least of which has been the unexpected loss of its most famous member. ""[Katherine's] taking it real hard,"" Joe Jackson told ABC News about his wife's coping with their son's death. ""When you start talking about Michael, she starts crying."" By many accounts, Katherine Jackson, 79, shared a special bond with her second-youngest son. In a 1993 interview with talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jackson spoke glowingly of the matriarch. ""My mother's wonderful,"" he said. ""To me, she's perfection."" According to a biography posted by A&E Networks, Katherine Jackson was born Kattie B. Screws in 1930 in Barbour County, Alabama. Her family reportedly relocated to East Chicago, Indiana, when she was 4, and her name was changed to Katherine Esther Scruse. A childhood bout with polio left her with a permanent limp. She was a teenager when she met Joe Jackson, an aspiring musician and a boxer whose first marriage dissolved. Katherine said it was love at first sight. ""I just had a feeling that he was going to be my husband,"" Katherine Jackson said in an interview shot last year by Xonger Global Entertainment Networks for a planned reality show about the family. The video was obtained by ABC News. ""The first time I saw him, I fell in love with him."" Together, they raised 10 children in a modest Gary, Indiana, home, while Joe worked as a crane operator, according to the A&E biography. A devout Jehovah's Witness, Katherine nurtured the children's love of music by singing with them, made her sons' costumes as their father booked local gigs, and served as the family's backbone. ""As best as I could tell from both talking to [Michael] and my observations of the family throughout the years, Katherine was the one that had really unconditional love for Michael and was always there, was always supportive and was always comforting,"" said journalist and CNN contributor Bryan Monroe, who conducted the last major interview with Michael Jackson. ""It was the epitome of a mother's love."" Joe Jackson's relationship with his famous son was a bit more complicated. Monroe said the hard taskmaster -- who Michael said sometimes held a belt in his hand as he and his brothers rehearsed -- evoked mixed emotions from the singer. ""In my interview with him, [Michael] spoke almost in the same breath of the fear he had of Joseph's sternness ... and at the same time the respect he had for Joseph's work ethics and his teachings,"" Monroe said. ""He said [Joseph] taught him and his brothers an awful lot about discipline and performance."" According to the biography posted by A&E Networks, Joe Jackson was born in Arkansas in 1929 and pursued fame early on, first as a Golden Gloves contender and later as a member of The Falcons, a band he started in the mid-1950s. When he noticed musical talent in his brood, he formed the Jackson Brothers with his three oldest sons and served as their manager. The group later became The Jackson 5, with young Michael serving as lead singer, and shot to superstardom. Psychotherapist Daniel Aferiat, who never treated any Jackson family members, said such an awesome responsibility for a young Michael Jackson could account for the conflicted emotions he expressed in his 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey. ""I just wish I could understand my father,"" he told her. ""If as a small child Michael Jackson was involved in making business decisions and had to have the burdens in some ways of the financial responsibility for the family, then it can turn around who's the caretaker and who's being taken care of,"" Aferiat said. Aferiat said children identify with their parents and learn how to operate in the world based on how they are treated by their parents. The drive for stardom and perfection that Joe Jackson reportedly instilled in his children would have long-lasting effects, Aferiat said. ""People are complicated, and while we all would like to think in more black-and-white terms -- someone's good and someone's bad -- [Michael Jackson] had a very complicated, very difficult and, what I would unequivocally say from what I've heard in the news, a traumatic life,"" Aferiat said. ""If you are a child and you have to give up your childhood, it's not like a pair of shoes that you just get to replace at a later time. You don't get that back."" By many accounts, Katherine Jackson tried to keep her children's lives as normal as possible given their fame, even during their adulthood. Author Richard Hack co-wrote the 1995 book ""Jackson Family Values: Memories of Madness"" with Margaret Maldonado, the mother of two of Jermaine Jackson's children. He said Katherine Jackson was ""like Mother Earth"" to her family. ""She kept everyone pretty well grounded because she didn't buy into all of the publicity and a lot of the glitz,"" said Hack, a noted biographer who has written 17 books. ""Mind you, she did drive around in a Rolls Royce, but she still knew how to make a meal. She would get into the kitchen and bring the family together."" Back then, Hack said, most of the family lived together in the Encino compound. These days, Katherine still resides in California, while her husband reportedly has relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada. ""We're not together all of the time,"" Katherine Jackson said in footage from the planned reality show. ""We stayed together for many, many years."" ""But we see each other all the time,"" she added. ""I go to Vegas and he'll come here."" Their living arrangement could become an issue during a custody hearing. Katherine Jackson was granted temporary guardianship of the children by a judge several days after her son's death. It is still unknown whether Debbie Rowe, the biological mother of two of the children, will seek custody.  Watch opinions on who should get the kids » . While Katherine is the only parent seeking legal custody of Michael Jackson's children, his father has been quoted by ABC News as saying he believes the two of them are ideally suited to take care of and raise the children ""to be strong Jacksons."" Hack, the co-author of ""Jackson Family Values,"" said that in the past Joe Jackson's children viewed him as the ""instigator and dictator"" who no longer managed their careers but still viewed himself as their voice. A bit of that behavior was on display last year when the elder Jackson returned to Gary, Indiana, and endorsed a planned family museum. The Post-Tribune newspaper reported that he didn't believe the city needed to gain his famous children's approval to build the project. ""I'm Joe Jackson,"" he was quoted as saying. ""I don't need them to approve anything."" But when it comes to Michael Jackson's children, the court will have the final say.","Joseph and Katherine Jackson had different parenting styles, observers say .

"(CNN) -- It's been eight years since Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint first hopped on the Hogwarts Express, and the three have done little else since. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have kept each other ""level-headed,"" said Radcliffe. Now that the ride will soon come to an end, the cast is trying to fathom a life without the Harry Potter films -- an understandable difficulty, considering that they've grown up along with their characters. The other item showing its age is the storyline of the sixth installment, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."" Part humor and part horror with a healthy dose of hormones, ""Half-Blood Prince"" is clearly more attuned for an audience who, like the cast, are no longer in grade school. ""On the one hand, we have all this light romance and snogging, and on the other hand, people are getting killed, and bridges are being blown up,"" director David Yates said.  Potter 101: A guide to Harry Potter » . Heavy stuff, certainly, but it's a challenge on par with the stars' blossoming careers.  Hear, see and read how the characters have grown » . One can only imagine that by now, the Potter series feels like home to Daniel Radcliffe, who landed the title role at 11 after playing supporting roles in the BBC's ""David Copperfield"" and the 2001 film ""The Tailor of Panama."" ""[Without it], to be honest, I don't know what I would've done,"" said Radcliffe, who turns 20 on July 23. ""I had 'Copperfield,' but at that point I wasn't even dreaming about [acting] being a career then."" Since then, Radcliffe has grown into international stardom, reportedly earning $25 million per Potter film. Indeed, the actor has gotten raves away from the movie theater: In London and on Broadway, Radcliffe took on the role of Alan Strang, the mentally disturbed stable boy in Peter Shaffer's ""Equus,"" which required him to strip naked in the play's final scene. Radcliffe has also taken on roles in ""December Boys"" and the TV movie ""My Boy Jack,"" and he is eager to keep at it long after the Potter series wraps. So what about directing, then? Only time will tell, Radcliffe said. ""For now, I want to keep acting,"" the actor said. ""I don't think I know enough about the technical sides yet to even consider directing. It would be something that I'm interested in, but it would be a long, long way off."" As for Watson, when she's not occupied with filming, she can be found in the pages of fashion magazines -- including the advertisements. Having landed covers for both Teen Vogue and the UK version of Elle within the past few months, it's no wonder that the 19-year-old was chosen to be the face of Burberry's autumn line. Going from tween wizard to fashion icon is quite a leap, but it's one that appears to fit Watson well; how many other Hogwarts students can count Karl Lagerfeld among their friends? Like her co-star Rupert Grint (Ron), Watson didn't have any acting experience when she auditioned for ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" at age 9. She managed to beat out thousands of other girls for the role of Hermione, a part she's said was ""life or death"" for her. Now that the series is close to its end, the actress is eager to try new things. ""I would've told myself not to take it so seriously and to try to have as much fun as you can,"" Watson said she would've advised her younger self. But similar to her Potter character, Hermione, Watson is eager to hit the books after the series concludes. The actress confirmed that she plans to start college in the United States this fall. For Grint, the future is a bit more unclear. ""I don't know what I'm going to be doing, really,"" the actor told the Los Angeles Times. ""I'm going to miss it, I think, because I've been doing this my whole life."" Despite his start as an unknown -- Grint reportedly submitted hip-hop lyrics describing his character to snag the part of Ron Weasley -- he's arguably been the most adventurous of his co-stars, having played opposite Paul Giamatti in the 2002 family comedy ""Thunderpants"" and starring in 2009's sexually charged thriller ""Cherrybomb."" His third film outside the Potter series will be the indie ""Wild Target,"" co-starring another British sensation, Emily Blunt. iReport.com: Share your reviews of the latest ""Potter"" Whatever their plans, all three have a few years to go before they hang up their magic wands; the last installment of ""Harry Potter"" is being filmed in two parts, and the final film won't premiere until 2011. And, Radcliffe said, they've helped each other cope with fame over the years. He said that on the red carpet, ""[the fans are] cheering for a kind of person they see in newspapers and in interviews and in films, and that's a different person to you. You have to keep that -- that persona -- and the person you actually are as separate as you possibly can, and then you will avoid becoming arrogant."" Which is why it helps to have two people who know you well, on set and off. ""I think we've all kept each other pretty level-headed over the years,"" Radcliffe said. CNN's Doug Ganley and Neil Curry contributed to this story.","With ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"" Potter film series almost done .

"(Budget Travel) -- Last October, more than 40 people followed signs depicting a skull and crossbones, with a knife and fork in place of the bones, to a secluded Bavarian-style hunting lodge 30 minutes north of St. Louis. An Entre dinner party was hosted in a Missouri hunting lodge. The attendees didn't have any idea where they were headed or what to expect. All they knew was that they were in for a five-course meal courtesy of John-Jack, an undercover chef who'd invited each of them via a top-secret e-mail to the latest of what he calls his Entre dinner parties. Guests arrived to a bluegrass band jamming in a room decorated with deer antlers. As a fire crackled in the massive stone fireplace, they dined on wild-elk medallions, home-cured bacon, grapefruit confit, and butternut squash ice cream -- and toasted their good fortune with pumpkin ale from nearby microbrewery Schlafly. Welcome to the world of underground supper clubs. Getting a reservation requires a little detective work, but once in, you may never go back to eating out the old-school way again. The idea behind these dinners is to let talented chefs work their whisks in an affordable, relaxed setting. And since they're often operating out of their own kitchens, without a license to serve the public, these cooks have to keep the locales, and their own identities, under wraps. Budget Travel:  The utterly random dinner party . ""The trend started in food-centric cities like San Francisco, but in the last year, groups have been popping up across the country,"" says Jenn Garbee, author of ""Secret Suppers,"" which spotlights some of the more than 80 clubs now up and running in the U.S. One such is Guerrilla Cuisine, founded by an incognito cook in Charleston, South Carolina, who uses the alias Jimihatt and wears a ninja mask at his gatherings. As at many clubs, diners must submit their reservations weeks in advance on Jimihatt's Web site and then wait for an e-mail with directions to the hush-hush locale. Based on his track record, you won't be disappointed: The bearded Jimihatt and his rotating crew of sous-chefs have served secret, Southern-style suppers (andouille sausage gumbo, Cajun smoked chicken, chocolate beignets) in galleries, wineries, even a grocery store. Budget Travel: Haute diners . Jimihatt now has a little friendly competition from an Atlanta cook named Lady Rogue. Her RogueApron shindigs each have a different theme. At a recent event, a Great Depression-style repast in Lang-Carson Park, guests stood in a soup line for pancetta minestrone with porcini mushrooms, and lemongrass-spiked corn broth. Then they divided into teams for an impromptu game of Wiffle ball. ""Our goal,"" Lady Rogue says, ""is to make dining more inclusive and to have strangers connect over food. What better way to meet people?"" For those hoping to break bread with their own buddies, there's 12B in Vancouver. To keep operations simple, its mastermind, Chef Todd, hosts the six-course dinners in his own apartment, hence the name. And unlike most supper clubs, 12B cooks only for groups of friends (up to 12 at a time). Budget Travel: Pay-what-you-like restaurants . ""Even after working 16-hour days, I would sit at home and think, 'I've got to find a way to feed more people,'"" Chef Todd says. Money isn't the incentive. His minimum-donation fee of $50 just covers costs for a feast (stuffed artichoke hearts, five-mushroom ravioli, butter-poached scallops served with BBQ pulled pork) that would average twice as much in a restaurant. But as Chef Todd will attest, these clubs are less about saving and more about spending a night eating exceptionally well in the unlikeliest of places, whether a cozy lodge straight out of a fairy tale or a humble living room.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- Another child has died from last week's fire at a day care center in northwestern Mexico, bringing the death toll to 45, the state-run Notimex news agency said. A crib and baby seats sit outside the scene of a deadly day care center fire in Mexico. The child died Friday in a hospital in the city of Guadalajara, Notimex said. The news agency did not provide any additional information. A fire raged through the ABC day care center on June 5 in the city of Hermosillo in Sonora state. Officials said an air-conditioning unit in a government-run warehouse in the same building as the day care center caused the blaze. In another development Friday, three officials from the Mexican Institute of Social Security were fired, Notimex reported. The social security institute oversaw the ABC day care facility. Earlier, the Institute of Social Security removed its Sonora director, Arturo Leyva Lizarraga. Leyva Lizarraga was ""separated"" from the agency Wednesday to ""facilitate the investigative process,"" according to Notimex. The same wording was used in announcing Friday's firings. Earlier in the week, two other people who ran the center resigned from the government jobs they held. Also Friday, Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora said officials had found safety irregularities at the day care center in 2005, Notimex said. He declined to detail those irregularities but said authorities are investigating if anything was done about them. Any negligent officials will be punished once the investigation is completed, Medina said.","NEW: Three officials from supervisory agency dismissed .

"(CNN) -- Pig farmers threw rocks at police officers in Cairo, Egypt, on Sunday as health workers gathered the farmers' herds for slaughter in what the government says is a precaution against the spread of swine flu, an interior ministry official told CNN. The Egyptian government required all pigs in the country be killed, citing a need to prevent the spread of swine flu. Brig. Gen. Hani Abdel-Latif said 50 to 60 protesters gathered in Cairo's Manshiyet Naser slum because they were upset with the health ministry's decision to slaughter all pigs in the country. But local media reported the number of farmers clashing with police on Sunday was in the hundreds. Experts have criticized the Egyptian government's move, announced last week, to slaughter all pigs regardless of whether they are infected. There have been no confirmed cases of the virus in Egypt. And according to the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, humans cannot get the swine flu virus, known to scientists as the H1N1 virus, by eating pork. The CDC says human infection from pigs most likely occurs when people are in close proximity to sick animals, such as in pig barns. But Egyptian officials cite how avian flu still exists in the country because, they say, the government did not take sufficient protective measures when that disease was first discovered there in 2006. Most Egyptian pig farmers are Coptic Christians, a group that makes up about 10 percent of the 80 million people in the mostly Muslim nation. Coptic Christians do not observe the Muslim ban on eating pork, and historically they have coexisted peacefully with the Muslim majority in Egypt. The farmers also work in the garbage industry and use their daily collections to feed their herds, which number about 300,000 animals in the country. With the government-mandated slaughter under way, Egypt's Health Ministry declared Saturday that ""Egypt is free of the swine flu."" Dr. Hamid Samaha, head of the country's Public Institute for Veterinary Services, said that starting Sunday the government will compensate pig farmers by paying as much as $45 for a disease-free pig and about $5 for diseased ones. The health ministry told CNN its workers are freezing all the disease-free meat and plan to give it back to its owners once the ban on pigs is lifted. But according to Egypt's state-run al-Akhbar newspaper, ministry sources said the country does not have enough facilities to store the frozen meat. Ministry spokesman Dr. Abdel-Rahman Shaheen said the government will open two new slaughterhouses in two provinces near Cairo, al-Alioubiya and al-Giza. Shaheen also announced Saturday that the ministry has enlisted 100 additional doctors and nurses to help in health quarantines at Cairo Airport, where travelers are being questioned if they have been to Mexico recently. And more are expected to be hired to help at Alexandra's main seaport, where the government declared a state of emergency last week.

"(CNN) -- The news that one of America's TV icons is suffering from cancer brought sadness. Learning the type of cancer she had made some squeamish. Farrah Fawcett, shown here in 2004, learned she had cancer in 2006. Former ""Charlie's Angels"" actress Farrah Fawcett, 62, was hospitalized this week. She received a diagnosis of anal cancer in 2006. This type of cancer is less common than rectal and colon cancer, and the location of the tumor and risk factors make people squeamish about discussing it openly, doctors said. Colon cancer at one time also was not openly talked about, because of the body part  and functions affected, but with the public awareness campaigns and celebrities advocating for screenings, it has been largely destigmatized. Anal cancer is less familiar. Fawcett has not publicly confirmed the specifics of her illness, but is working on a documentary, titled ""A Wing and a Prayer,"" about her health battle. Anal cancer affects more women and the illness is usually found in people who are in their early 60's. The American Cancer Society estimates that 5,000 new cases of anal cancer are diagnosed each year and about 680 people die from it annually. Meanwhile, colorectal cancer has 148,000 new cases and about 50,000 deaths each year. The numbers of anal cancer cases are rising, although experts haven't been able to pinpoint why. Cultural squeamishness about certain body areas could prevent early diagnosis and treatment of anal cancer, said Dr. Petr F. Hausner, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland. ""Patients in the United States hate to be examined in these areas,"" said Hausner, who trained in Czechoslovakia. ""They like to keep their private parts more private than in Europe. In the U.S., the patients hate those exams and physicians hate to do them. The examination is incomplete."" The cultural discomfort might be a minor factor, though. ""The bigger role is the virus,"" he said referring to the human papilloma virus, a key risk factor for anal cancer that also can cause cervical cancer. Getting vaccinated against HPV is a step in prevention, Hausner said. More than half of anal cancer patients experience bleeding as a symptom. Others have no symptoms or report common conditions, such as hemorrhoids, fissures, or warts. Symptoms also include itching or pain in that area, changes in the diameter of stool, abnormal discharge, swollen lymph nodes in the anal or groin areas, according to the American Cancer Society. ""The most common thing is people think it's a hemorrhoid,"" said Dr. Cathy Eng, associate professor in the department of gastrointestinal medical oncology at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Patients should consult with their physicians, she said. Anal pap smears are routine only for HIV-positive patients, who are at higher risk for this cancer. There are no anal cancer screening recommendations for non-HIV individuals, because it remains a rare disease, Hausner said. People whose immune system are suppressed, from HIV or drugs taken after organ transplants are at risk for anal cancer. Other risk factors include a sexual history with many partners, a medical history of human papilloma virus (HPV), sexually transmitted diseases or gynecological cancers. People tend to view anal cancer negatively, because they associate the cancer with a few of its risk factors -- such as sexually transmitted diseases or anal sex, Eng said. ""It's one of the risk factors, not the only risk factor,"" Eng said. ""It's fair to say people are stigmatized, she said, primarily because of the disease's association with that type of sex. When anal cancer is caught early, chemotherapy and radiation are highly effective. But if the cancer doesn't respond to treatment and spreads to other areas of the body, the five-year survival rate plummets to 20 percent, Eng said. ""Anal cancer is unique,"" she said. ""The majority of time you can cure the patient, but if you have recurrent or residual disease, you could end up losing your sphincter."" The sphincter are muscles that holds in urine and feces. If the sphincter is removed, the patient must have a special bag, called an ostomy pouch, that collects the waste. Anal cancer is ""much rarer than colon cancer,"" Hausner said. ""For 50 colon cancer patients, we see one anal cancer... It's a rare disease. It is becoming a little bit more frequent. I would say that people are not aware.""","Risk factors for anal cancer include suppressed immune system, HPV, STDs .
New cases of anal cancer number about 5,000 a year, with 680 deaths per year .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sonia Sotomayor strongly asserted her adherence to the law while dodging questions about her personal beliefs on the third day of her Supreme Court confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sonia Sotomayor answers questions from senators on Wednesday, the third day of her confirmation hearings. Asked repeatedly Wednesday by Republicans about her controversial statement that a ""wise Latina"" could reach a better decision than a white man, Sotomayor called it a poorly expressed but valid point about the value of differing perspectives in applying the law. Senators from both parties pressed her on her personal views on issues such as abortion, gun control and executive powers. But Sotomayor consistently answered she needed to know the specifics of a particular case, such as applicable state statutes and other facts. Sensing frustration over her responses, the federal appellate judge offered an explanation about how judges approach the law. ""What we do is different than the conversations citizens have about what they want the law to do,"" Sotomayor said Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, who sought her views on the legality of some kinds of abortions and whether there was a fundamental right to possess firearms and self-defense. Judges look at the facts of a case and apply the law based on those facts, she said. ""It's not that we make a broad policy choice and say this is what we want,"" Sotomayor continued.  Watch Face Off: Should Sotomayor be confirmed? » . Her performance rankled Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter, the former Republican committee chairman who changed parties last April. Specter repeatedly cut off Sotomayor's responses Wednesday, saying she was not answering his questions. Later, in praising Sotomayor's record as a judge, Specter said: ""I'm not commenting about your answers, but your record is exemplary."" ""You'll be judged on your record more than your answers,"" he said. If approved by the committee and confirmed by the full Senate, the 55-year-old Sotomayor would be the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice, the third female justice and the 111th person to sit on the nation's highest court.  Watch Sotomayor being questioned » . Her dispassionate answers on a range of issues displayed a command of legal concepts that impressed even her harshest interrogators. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, appeared to rule out a filibuster attempt against the nomination by his minority party, telling Sotomayor that ""you will get that up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.""  Watch Cornyn quiz Sotomayor on abortion » . Democrats predicted she would be confirmed with support from members of both parties. Cornyn and other Republicans raised the ""wise Latina"" statement for a second straight day, asking whether it meant she had a gender, ethnic or racial bias. Sotomayor said the remark she made in several speeches was never intended to mean that one gender, ethnic or racial group was better than another. ""It is clear from the attention that my words have gotten and the manner in which it has been understood by some people that my words failed,"" Sotomayor said. ""They didn't work."" iReport.com: Share your thoughts on the Sotomayor hearings . However, she defended the point she was trying to make, and said other Supreme Court justices including Sandra Day O'Connor and Samuel Alito had expressed similar thoughts. ""The message that the entire speech attempted to deliver, however, remains the message that I think Justice O'Connor meant, the message that higher nominees, including Justice Alito, meant when he said that he considers his Italian ancestry when deciding discrimination cases,"" said Sotomayor.  See how Sotomayor compares with justices on the court » . O'Connor, the first woman Supreme Court justice, had said she believed a wise female judge and a wise male judge could reach the same conclusion. ""I don't think Justice O'Connor meant that personal experiences compel results in any way,"" Sotomayor said. ""I think life experiences generally, whether it's that I'm a Latina or was a state prosecutor or have been a commercial litigator or been a trial judge and an appellate judge, that the mixture of all of those things, the amalgam of them help me to listen and understand."" She repeated her statement from Tuesday that poor wording caused misunderstanding of what she meant to say, explaining that judges ""rely on the law to command the results in the case."" ""So when one talks about life experiences, and even in the context of my speech, my message was different than I understand my words have been understood by some,"" Sotomayor continued. Cornyn pressed Sotomayor if she stood by her words from Tuesday's testimony that her ""wise Latina"" statement was a failed rhetorical flourish using ""words that don't make sense and that they're a bad idea?"" ""I stand by the words. It fell flat,"" Sotomayor responded. ""And I understand that some people have understood them in a way that I never intended. And I would hope that, in the text of the speech, that they would be understood."" In one of Wednesday's few sharp exchanges, Sotomayor rejected Alabama Sen. Jeff Session's contention that she had pre-judged the issue of gun control.  Learn more about Sotomayor's past rulings » . Sessions, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, asked whether she would recuse herself from gun control cases because she ruled in the past that the right to bear arms under the Second Amendment does not apply to state gun control laws. ""I have not made up my mind. I didn't say that I didn't believe it was fundamental,"" Sotomayor shot back. She explained that the word ""fundamental"" in legal terms refers to whether a federal statute applies to the states. The ruling cited by Sessions referred to a prior case that made the determination, Sotomayor said, so she was following the precedent. Sotomayor previously said she recognizes an individual right to bear arms as recently identified by the Supreme Court in the ruling District of Columbia v. Heller. Also Wednesday, Sotomayor told how an episode of the television show ""Perry Mason"" influenced her to become a prosecutor. She cited an episode in which Perry Mason, after winning yet another case, consoles beleaguered prosecutor Hamilton Burger by noting it must be hard to expend such effort only to have charges dismissed. ""No, my job as a prosecutor is to do justice, and justice is served when a guilty man is convicted and an innocent man is not,"" she quoted the prosecutor as saying. ""That TV character said something that motivated my choices in life,"" Sotomayor said.","NEW: Sotomayor asserts adherence to law, dodges questions about personal views .

"(CNN) -- Robert Swan's life reads like a boy's own adventure tale with a modern eco-twist. Robert Swan was the first man to walk to both the North and South Poles. Inspired by the daring age of Antarctic exploration, Swan followed in the footsteps of his heroes; the men who risked, and lost, their lives to reach the South Pole. At the age of 29 he embarked on an expedition to the South Pole that was unsupported -- a trek that required him to pull his own sleigh and that lacked medical support crews. By the time he was 33 he had become the first man to walk to both the North and South poles unsupported. But for Swan, the epic journeys to the Poles, and the sailing and overland adventures that have followed, unearthed more than just a spirit for adventure. He experienced firsthand the impact of humanity on the environment when under the hole in the ozone layer at the South Pole, the harsh ultraviolet rays from the sun burned his skin and permanently changed the color of his eyes. It firmed a desire to preserve the fragile natural world and to educate and inspire others, particularly the next generation of decision-makers to do the same. ""As the last unspoiled wilderness on Earth, Antarctica is currently protected by the treaty prohibiting drilling and mining until 2041. Decisions made by today's youth will impact our entire planet's ecosystem and the future of life on earth,"" he says on 2041.com. His polar icewalks gained international attention and in 1992 he was asked to speak at the UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, later gaining an OBE and being appointed Special Envoy to the Director General of UNESCO in recognition of his work. At the Earth Summit in Rio he committed to a ""global mission"" to remove 1,500 tons of waste from Antarctica. Swan and a team of young people from across the world were successful in cleaning up the Russian Antarctic base of Bellinghausen by 2000, making it inhabitable for wildlife again. Foresight, planning and determination then are not alien to a man who spent five years sourcing the funding for his first Antarctic expedition, and Swan's latest project is taking an even longer-term view. Swan founded his organization ""2041"" in 2003 in order to further his mission of action and education. Named after the year in which Antarctica's protection against mineral exploitation ends, Swan regularly takes business people, teachers and students on expeditions to Antarctica to impress on those with the capacity to enact change that preservation of the environment is essential and achievable. Continuing the green mission on the continent by minimizing the human footprint in the region, his international teams have helped design and build the world's first education station in Antarctica that is run solely on renewable energy. Add to the expeditions, ocean voyages on a boat with sails made from recycled plastic bottles, and it's clear that the veteran polar explorer is a man who is doing all he can to protect and preserve the Antarctic.","Explorer Robert Swan runs expeditions to Antarctica to promote eco-awareness .

"PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN)  -- Jaime Andrade had just gotten out of the shower when the men came to snatch him. Jaime Andrade was kept in this closet for three days without food or water, police say. His wife, Araceli Valencia, was mopping the kitchen in their family home on a typical warm spring morning in Phoenix, Arizona, ""when she suddenly felt a hard object pointed to the back of her head and a voice in Spanish tell her not to move,"" according to a Phoenix, Arizona, police investigative report. ""I told you not to look at me!"" Valencia heard one of the kidnappers bark as he struck Andrade across the head. Her four children bawling, Valencia was hustled into a bedroom where an armed man fondled her and threatened to rape her if she didn't tell him where Andrade hid his money, according to the report. After beating and binding Andrade, one of the kidnappers put a gun to Valencia's head. His message: We're taking your husband and SUV. We'll be watching your house. If you call the cops, he's a dead man. Andrade, his wife would later tell police, was a mechanic and freelance human smuggler, or coyote. Police say his 2006 kidnapping was evidence of a growing trend in Phoenix: drug and human traffickers abducting each other for ransoms or retribution.  Watch why Phoenix is the hotspot » . The trend continues, as police investigated roughly a kidnapping a day in 2007 and 2008 and are on track to shatter those numbers this year. Police are stingy with details of fresh cases navigating the court system, but recently allowed CNN to review the files from Andrade's kidnapping. For two and a half days after Andrade's abduction, the kidnappers -- including a man whom Andrade later said had been a friend -- deprived their victim of food and water. Through the door of the closet where he was held, Andrade could hear the cries of other victims being tortured in the house, the report said. Meanwhile, Valencia had defied the kidnappers and called police, who listened to Andrade ""scream and howl in pain"" over the phone as the kidnappers tried to cut off his ear and a finger. The torture would continue until Valencia came up with the ransom, the kidnappers told her.  Hear Andrade's wife plead with the kidnappers » . They were true to their word. Andrade was pistol-whipped and beaten with a baseball bat and the butt of a rifle. The kidnappers tried to gouge out his eye and slashed open his left eyebrow. They burned his back as well -- presumably, police said, with a blowtorch found at the scene. Read how the next door neighbors knew nothing of this . The blindfolded Andrade ""could feel his pants and underwear being cut open by an unknown person,"" he told police. He was told to bend over and was beaten when he refused. ""Jaime felt his legs being forced apart and heard Aldo say he was going to get his money,"" the report said. The kidnappers then sodomized him with a broomstick, a pair of scissors and a wooden dowel used to hang clothes in a closet. Kidnappers creative with coercion . Ferocity is often a hallmark of the abductions taking place in this south Arizona city of 1.5 million that serves as a prime transshipment point for drugs and human cargo.  Watch how the kidnappers choose their targets » . Phoenix police say they have yet to witness the level of violence -- the beheadings, the bodies shoved in drums -- that their counterparts are seeing in Mexico City or the border town of Juarez. ""It gets close sometimes,"" said Lt. Lauri Burgett, who heads the Home Invasion and Kidnapping Enforcement squad. Kidnappers will smash their victims' fingers with bricks, snip their backs open with wire cutters, carve them up with knives or simply shoot them. ""We've had them electrocuted. They set them in a tub with water and use kind of barbaric means and zap the tub. I think it was a battery hooked up,"" Burgett said. Two kidnappings last year resulted in murders, she added, but it's not the norm. Phoenix police formed the HIKE squad in October after two years of unprecedented kidnapping numbers -- 357 in 2007 and 368 in 2008 -- gave the city the dubious distinction of being the nation's kidnapping capital. Home invasions were not far behind: 317 in 2007 and 337 in 2008.  See kidnapping numbers since 1999 » . ""It's all about the money. And there's so much money to be made in this that you can't stop it, but you can try to reveal it, and then you can try to do something about it,"" Burgett said. The task force has made dozens of arrests, but as of March 31, the city had 101 reported kidnappings. If the trend continues, Phoenix will record an increase in kidnapping for a fourth straight year. More frustrating is that the numbers represent only a third, maybe less, of the city's kidnappings, said Sgt. Tommy Thompson, a police spokesman with 16 years of drug enforcement experience. Most kidnappings aren't reported, he said, because the victims are generally smugglers, drug dealers or illegal immigrants -- or some combination of the three. Other criminals targeted . The most common cases are criminal-on-criminal -- drug smugglers or coyotes snatching rivals or their loved ones. In some cases, a drug dealer may have lost a load or failed to make a payment, but there are also cases when kidnappers do it solely for the ransom, which can be between $30,000 and $250,000, Thompson said. ""[The victims are] wearing the doper bling-bling, and they target them,"" he said. ""We've had several cases where the ransom amount has been $1 million that the person has asked for. In addition to that, they often ask for drugs -- 100 pounds of marijuana, perhaps a pound or two of speed, a pound or two of cocaine or several ounces of heroin."" Phoenix police have even arrested victims after rescuing them, Burgett said. Less frequent but still accounting for 78 kidnappings last year are cases in which coyotes hold their human cargo captive or steal another coyote's patrons, known as pollos (Spanish for chickens), Burgett said. Burgett said human trafficking is often linked to the drug trade because both industries require the same routes and subterfuge to ferry their wares into the country. See what other cities have a cartel presence . There are rarely ""true victims"" in Phoenix's kidnappings, the lieutenant said. However, one criminal attorney who has represented at least 10 kidnappers in the last decade insists that the coyote business is ""uglier than the drug trade"" and that pollos are often killed or forced to do coyotes' bidding when they can't come up with the ransoms. ""In the drug business, the people getting killed are in the business. They are not end users, not consumers,"" said Antonio Bustamente. ""In the coyote business, the people killed are really innocent. [First-time] illegal entry is a petty offense."" Though many might debate the innocence of victims entangled in Phoenix's border-related violence, police say there have been instances when the kidnappers snatched the wrong mark. Girl mistakenly snatched . On the evening of March 17, 2008, a 13-year-old girl and her friend were walking out of a home in the suburb of Avondale. They were planning to play basketball. The friend, according to a police investigative report, was the niece of a man named ""Chucky."" Chucky and his cohorts, witnesses told police, had earlier stolen 55 pounds of marijuana and left several men tied up in a vacant house. Hours later, the investigative report said, armed men arrived at Chucky's sister's house in three vehicles, one a white Chevrolet Tahoe with blue-and-red strobes like the police use. The men wanted Chucky, their drugs or $24,000. The 13-year-old said she didn't know Chucky. When she tried to walk away, ""one of them grabbed her by the neck, pointed a gun at her and forced her in the vehicle,"" the report said. Eventually, the men called the girl's mother to demand ransom. A police officer took the phone and informed the men they had the wrong girl. She was released relatively unharmed in the suburb of Surprise. The case serves as a reminder that as police scramble to tamp the bloodshed before it reaches the levels proliferating south of the border, collateral damage is a reality.  Watch how the kidnapping often occur in quiet neighborhoods » . The origins of the kidnappers -- 90 percent of whom hail from the Mexican state from which the notorious Sinaloa drug cartel takes its name -- also remind law enforcement that 150 miles south lies a country racked with a more extreme brand of violence. The tortured Andrade was fortunate that police were able to find him. On Andrade's third day in captivity, an undercover officer posing as a loan shark convinced the kidnappers to lower their ransom from $50,000 to $10,000 and the title to the Ford Expedition they had stolen. When the kidnappers arrived at the drop point, a Safeway supermarket parking lot, police swarmed on their green Chevrolet Tahoe, the report said. One of the men, Luis Alberto Castro-Vega, then 23, disclosed Andrade's whereabouts after police promised not to charge him with kidnapping. Only Castro-Vega has been convicted of crimes associated with Andrade's kidnapping: first-degree burglary, theft by extortion, armed robbery and three counts of aggravated assault. In September 2006, a judge sentenced Castro-Vega to 54 years in prison. Thompson said he hopes the stiff sentence sends a message that Phoenix police expect the kidnappings and violence to end, regardless of the targets and the perpetrators. ""The problems that occur when it's criminal versus criminal, that's still violence on the streets of America,"" he said. ""If those people get in a gunbattle, those bullets have to go somewhere, and that could be a playground where kids are playing. That could be a neighbor's house where a neighbor is inside sleeping that has nothing to do whatsoever with the illegal activity, but yet they become senseless victims of the violence.""","Phoenix police investigated 368 kidnappings in 2008, 357 in 2007 .

"(CNN) -- A double amputee sprinter has won the right to be eligible to compete at this summer's Olympic Games in Beijing after sport's highest court backed his appeal against a ban imposed by athletics authorities. Paralympic champion Oscar Pistorious competed in two able-bodied athletics meetings in 2007. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that South African Oscar Pistorius, who runs on prosthetic blades, is eligible to compete against able-bodied athletes. Pistorius, 21, who lost both legs below the knees when he was a baby, runs on shock-absorbing carbon-fiber prosthetics that resemble bent skis -- earning him the nickname ""Blade Runner."" Pistorius, a Paralympic Games champion and world record holder, had lobbied the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to allow him to compete at the Olympics this August, but after extensive tests the IAAF ruled in January that his J-shaped prosthetics qualify as technical aids, which are banned in IAAF-governed sports. The IAAF does allow athletes with prosthetics to compete in able-bodied sports, as long as the IAAF believes they do not give the athlete an unfair edge. But Friday's ruling by the CAS in Lausanne, Switzerland, overturned that verdict. In a statement, it said that its panel had ""not been persuaded that there was sufficient evidence of any metabolic advantage in favor of a double-amputee"" using Pistorius' blades. Appeals of court decisions are allowed, but on very limited grounds. But the CAS said it did not exclude the possibility that future scientific tests could be developed which might enable the IAAF to prove that the blades provided Pistorius with an advantage over able-bodied athletes. The South African won gold in the 200 meters, and bronze in the 100 meters at the 2004 Paralympic Games in Athens. He holds the Paralympic world records in the 100, 200, and 400 meters. Since Athens, he has competed in two able-bodied races in which he finished second and last, respectively. Pistorius will have emphasized to the court the disadvantages he feels he has by running with prosthetics, CNN World Sport's Don Riddell said. ""There are disadvantages when it's windy, when it's raining, (and) it takes him longer to get up to speed at the start,"" Riddell said. ""He will be hoping that they take everything into consideration and not just rule on how much spring his prosthetic limbs give him."" In November, the IAAF carried out tests on Pistorius over two days at the German Sport University in Cologne to determine if his prosthetics, known as Cheetah limbs, could be considered a technical aid. A team of more than 10 scientists used high-speed cameras, special equipment to measure ground-reaction forces, and a three-dimensional scanner to record body mass. The scientists concluded Pistorius was able to run with his prosthetic blades at the same speed as able-bodied sprinters with about 25 percent less energy expenditure. Pistorius' blades gave him an energy return nearly three times higher than the human ankle joint offers in maximum sprinting, they said. Riddell described Friday's ruling in Pistorius' favor as ""groundbreaking,"" and said it raised questions about the future of paralympic sports. ""What does this do to the future of the Paralympics if he's allowed to run in the able-bodied Olympics? Is he actually doing a disservice to other Paralympic athletes? Does it cheapen the Paralympic Games?"" Riddell asked.","Court of Arbitration for Sport backs double amputee sprinter in Olympic bid .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Zimbabwe slashed 12 zeros from its currency as hyperinflation continued to erode its value, the country's central bank announced Monday. Patrick Chinamasa, Zimbabwe's acting finance minister, arrives last week at Parliament to present the '09 budget. ""Even in the face of current economic and political challenges confronting the economy, the Zimbabwe dollar ought to and must remain the nation's currency, so as to safeguard our national identity and sovereignty. ... Our national currency is a fundamental economic pillar of our sovereignty,"" said Gideon Gono, governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. ""Accordingly, therefore, this monetary policy statement unveils yet another necessary program of revaluing our local currency, through the removal of 12 zeros with immediate effect."" The move means that 1 trillion in Zimbabwe dollars now will be equivalent to one Zimbabwe dollar. The old notes -- with the highest being 100 trillion dollars -- not enough to buy a loaf of bread -- will remain valid until June 30, after which they will cease to be legal tender. One U.S. dollar is trading above 300 trillion Zimbabwe dollars. This third attempt to lop off zeros comes barely six months after the Zimbabwe government last adjusted its currency as it continues to lose value. World-record inflation estimated to be in the billions of percent -- but officially at 231 million percent as of July last year -- has quickly eroded the currency's value again and again. The highest note on the new set is 500 Zimbabwe dollars. Many Zimbabwean traders have stopped accepting the local currency, preferring foreign currency due to the hyperinflationary environment. Last week, the country's acting finance minister, Patrick Chinamasa, allowed the use of foreign currency by everyone else. Despite the use of foreign currency, the Zimbabwe dollars are in acute shortage, resulting in many people sleeping outside their banks hoping to get money the following day. Regarding the cash shortages, Gono blamed Germany for dropping a contract that helped the country print money. ""The country has suffered bouts of cash shortages, which have disadvantaged both the corporate and household sectors,"" he said. ""As a country, we have come to terms with this stubborn reality that we were put under economic sanctions by Germany, which unilaterally cut a 50-year-old contract to supply us with currency printing paper, machinery, spare parts and inks without notice in July last year.""","One trillion in Zimbabwe dollars now will be equivalent to one Zimbabwe dollar .

"(CNN) -- Officials said a British Airways jet had to be evacuated Friday at a Phoenix, Arizona, airport after smoke was reported in the cabin.

Firefighters used a thermal imaging camera, but could not determine a source of a fire, Jamison said. Jamison said the smoke may have been caused by electrical problems.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- House Democrats unveiled their revised version of health care reform Tuesday, offering a proposal that includes a government-funded health insurance option, requires both individuals and employers to participate, and taxes the wealthy to help cover costs. President Obama has urged Congress to work quickly on creating a health care reform bill. Democratic House leaders said the measure, titled ""America's Affordable Health Choices Act,"" met the requirements set by President Obama for health care reform by lowering costs to consumers and businesses, letting people keep their current plan if desired, and preventing denial of coverage due to pre-existing medical conditions. ""The House proposal will begin the process of fixing what's broken about our health care system, reducing costs for all, building on what works, and covering an estimated 97 percent of all Americans,"" Obama said in a written statement. ""And by emphasizing prevention and wellness, it will also help improve the quality of health care for every American."" Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, said the bill is intended to repair a ""dysfunctional"" health care system that is draining the U.S. economy while leaving 46 million Americans without health insurance. ""We are going to accomplish what many people felt wouldn't happen in our lifetime,"" he said. But House Republicans slammed the Democrats' bill and pledged to try to amend it as three House committees begin considering the legislation later this week. Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, said the bill ""without any question will kill jobs, will limit access to health care, will raise taxes and will lead to a government takeover of health care."" Blunt said he will offer an amendment requiring all elected federal officials, including Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, to enroll in the new public insurance option. Republicans and some fiscally conservative Democrats also question the cost of health care reform. An earlier draft of the House Democrats' bill carried a price tag of $1 trillion over 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office said the revised house bill also would cost $1 trillion. However, a senior Democratic House committee staffer said the CBO analysis only covered costs without factoring in cost-saving measures worth $500 billion over 10 years or the revenue from tax surcharges on wealthy Americans, estimated to raise more than $500 billion over a decade. According to the CBO, the bill would cover 97 percent of Americans by 2015. The bill includes tax surcharges on Americans in the top 1.2 percent of income. It proposes a 5.4 percent surtax on couples earning more than $1 million, a 1.5 percent surtax on couples with income between $500,000 and $1 million, and a 1 percent surtax on joint incomes over $350,000 or individual income over $280,000. Anticipating Republican complaints that the tax surcharges would harm small business owners who report their income as personal, Democratic sponsors said the measure would affect less than 5 percent of all small business owners. Specific provisions of the bill include: . -- A Health Insurance Exchange providing individuals and small business with choices for coverage, including a government-funded public option. -- No more coverage exclusion for pre-existing conditions. -- Affordability credits for low- and moderate-income individuals and families, available to those with incomes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level, or $43,000 for individuals and $88,000 for a family of four. -- Limits on annual out-of-pocket spending. -- Expanded Medicaid coverage to individuals and families with incomes at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level. -- Required participation by individuals, with a penalty of 2.5 percent of adjusted gross income for non-compliance. -- Requirement that businesses with payrolls exceeding $250,000 provide their employees with health coverage or contribute up to 8 percent of their payroll on their behalf. -- A series of measures intended to reduce costs of Medicaid, Medicare and other existing systems. A statement Tuesday from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups opposed some of the bill's proposals, calling for market forces and employer autonomy instead of mandated participation by businesses. ""Exempting some micro-businesses will not prevent this provision from killing many jobs,"" the statement said. The House bill now goes to three committees for debate and revision before consideration by the full chamber. The Senate also is considering health reform measures that contain some of the House bill provisions. Obama has said he wants both chambers to pass their respective proposals before Congress goes on its August recess as part of a timetable to get a final bill to his desk by the end of the year. House Republican Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia argued that the current economic conditions mean Congress should take its time on a major overhaul of the health care system. ""There's no need for us to be rushing into passing legislation before the end of this month at the potential cost of, really, millions of jobs,"" Cantor said Tuesday. A CNN-Opinion Research Corp. survey released July 1 found that a slim majority -- 51 percent -- support Obama's health care plans, but most worry that their costs would go up, and only one in five think their families would be better off.

"People with a gene variant that sharply increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease in old age may show memory impairment earlier than thought -- sometimes well before their 60th birthday, according to new study in the New England Journal of Medicine. A variant of the APOE gene indicates whether a person has a greater risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Between 20 and 35 percent of Americans have one or two copies of this gene variant, inherited from one or both parents. People with one copy of the variant, called apolipoprotein E-e4 (APOE e4), have a 29 percent lifetime risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, while people who don't have it have a 9 percent risk. People with two copies of APOE e4 have an even higher Alzheimer's risk, but it's hard to define the exact percentage as only 2 percent of the population falls into this category. Despite the gene-related health problems, another study in the same issue of the journal suggests that people who learn they do have APOE e4 seem to handle the information pretty well. But the researchers excluded people with anxiety or depression, and they followed people for just a year. Therefore, the results don't tell the whole story about what it would be like for most people to find out whether they carried the APOE e4 gene. Nevertheless, the findings are an important first step, said Dr. Kenneth Kosik, a professor of neuroscience at the University of California Santa Barbara and the codirector of UCSB's Neuroscience Research Institute. ""I think it opens the door to ask the deeper questions,"" said Kosik, referring to the possible consequences for individuals and society if widespread APOE testing were introduced. (Kosik was not involved with either study.) If people do find out they have the APOE e4 gene, Kosik added, the new memory study could make the news harder to bear. Dr. Richard J. Caselli, of the Mayo Clinic Arizona, in Scottsdale, and his colleagues followed 815 people ages 21 to 97 with normal mental function, including 317 who had at least one copy of the APOE e4 gene. On one test of a person's ability to learn and remember (the Auditory-Verbal Learning Test) gene carriers showed declines in their scores beginning in their 50s. For people without the APOE e4 gene, this decline started in their 70s. ""We're not talking anymore about a retired population; we're talking about people who will be in the midst of their career,"" Caselli said. He added that many would be in positions of responsibility in which they need to have all their wits about them -- and they may not. Health.com: Eat smarter in your 30s, 40s, and 50s . ""[The study] forces us to really think about the brave new world of genetics,"" and how this information might be used, Kosik said. Although there had been a ""clear line"" between having the APOE e4 gene but being dementia-free and having Alzheimer's disease, that distinction isn't as clear anymore, he explained. For someone who discovers he or she has the APOE e4 gene, Caselli said, ""The only advice I have is, 'Don't panic.'"" Right now, APOE gene testing is only recommended for people with mild problems with mental function or dementia; for people with no symptoms, it should only be done in a research setting, experts said. Nevertheless, labs have sprung up that will offer the ""worried well"" an APOE gene test for a fee. Having APOE testing without adequate medical, psychological, or genetic counseling is ""inappropriate,"" said Dr. Hyman Schipper, a professor of neurology and medicine at McGill University, and the director of the Centre for Neurotranslational Research at SMBD--Jewish General Hospital, both in Montreal. In these situations, Schipper explained people may not interpret the results correctly, and could run the risk of psychological harm. For example, people who find out they carry the gene for Huntington's disease -- which means they have a 100 percent chance of developing a devastating neurodegenerative condition if they live long enough -- do indeed experience anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts, Schipper noted. Health.com: Fight aging -- the real secrets to staying young . In the second study, Dr. Robert C. Green of the Boston University School of Medicine, and his colleagues in the REVEAL Study Group set out to look at whether something similar would happen to people who found out they carried the Alzheimer's gene. They assigned 162 symptom-free people at random to a group who would receive their APOE genotyping results and a group who would not be told their results, and then checked their level of anxiety and depression -- as well as stress related to the gene test -- six weeks, six months, and one year after they got the news (or didn't). All of the study participants had a parent with Alzheimer's disease, but none of them had any signs of mental impairment or dementia. People who found out they didn't carry the gene variant were less stressed about the test than those who found out they did carry the gene. Green and his team also found that the higher a person scored on initial tests of anxiety and depression symptoms, the more likely he or she was to be anxious or depressed after finding out about the gene, although the researchers had excluded people with severe anxiety or depression from the study. However, there were no differences between the groups that were told the news and those who were not. The fact that people in the study agreed to be randomly assigned to get their APOE results suggests they ""are not representative of those who have a strong perceived need to know or need not to know,"" Rosalie A. Kane and Dr. Robert L. Kane of the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, wrote in an editorial published with the studies. The study also considered only the psychological impact of the news, they say. Some people might make major life decisions based on the news, such as deciding to hoard their money or spend it all. In addition, employers and health insurers are banned from discriminating against someone based on their genes, but companies offering long-term-care insurance, disability insurance, and life insurance are allowed to take this information into account. Health.com: How to get your way with body language . One major reason why learning APOE e4 status could be so stressful is that there's no clear way to reduce Alzheimer's risk. But there could be soon, some experts say. ""We don't know yet how by doing interventions whether or not we can beat the APOE gene or at least diminish its effects,"" said Kosik. ""We do know that the likelihood of getting Alzheimer's disease is very much affected by people's exercise level, their blood pressure, their cholesterol levels, perhaps their diet, and the degree to which they engage in cognitive challenges. All of those things have data, some stronger than others, that you can have some effect on your likelihood of getting Alzheimer's."" But, Caselli points out that trying to encourage people to exercise in order to prevent heart disease, for example, has been far from successful, and getting people to be active to ward off Alzheimer's may be equally difficult. Health.com: Heartburn or heart attack? How to tell the difference . Maybe, however, the thought of losing our minds is a bit more motivating than the idea of heart disease. ""There is some recent evidence to suggest, in fact, that personal knowledge of APOE status and general AD risk profile may spur healthy midlife adults to adopt or modify behaviors that might protect against the disease,"" Schipper said. Health.com: 10 Risk factors for heart disease . Apolipoprotein is a cholesterol-carrying molecule, and the gene that makes the protein comes in three slightly different versions -- e2, e3, and e4 (there's no e1).

"(CNN) -- Kids dig in the sand at the beach all the time, but the fun nearly turned fatal for an 11-year-old Pennsylvania boy this week. The 11-year-old was given CPR and revived before being taken to a local hospital. The boy was digging a tunnel with friends on a beach in Ocean City, Maryland, on Tuesday when part of it collapsed on top of him, authorities said. Lifeguards rushed to pull him out, but it first appeared that they were too late. The boy was not breathing, and he had no pulse, Beach Patrol Capt. Butch Arbin told CNN on Wednesday. But rescue crews revived the boy by performing CPR, said Arbin, who was at the scene. There was a lot of emotion on the beach when the boy's pulse came back, he said. ""He basically went from dead to life,"" Arbin said, adding that the boy's mother called the rescue a ""miracle."" As he was being rolled into an ambulance on a stretcher, the boy -- perhaps not realizing the trauma he had just survived -- complained to his mother that he had sand in his eyes, Arbin said. The child, whose family did not want to be identified, was initially taken to Atlantic General Hospital and later flown to the A.I. DuPont Hospital for Children in Delaware, he said. He's recovering there and probably will be released later Wednesday, Arbin said.","Boy, 11, was digging a tunnel with friends on a beach in Ocean City, Maryland .

"(CNN) -- Mauricio Funes, a member of a political party that waged guerrilla war against the government 17 years ago, claimed the presidency of El Salvador on Sunday night. FMLN's Mauricio Funes shows his ballot before voting Sunday in Antiguo Cuscatlan, El Salvador. ""This is the happiest night of my life,"" Funes told a jubilant crowd at his election headquarters. ""It's also the night of greatest hope for El Salvador."" With 90.68 percent of the votes counted, the FMLN party's Funes had 51.27 percent, while the ARENA party's Rodrigo Avila had 48.73 percent, the country's Supreme Electoral Tribunal said. The final tally will be certified within 48 hours, the electoral council's Walter Araujo said in a nationally televised news conference. Funes' victory ended a 20-year hold on the presidency by the right-leaning ARENA. ""Now the ARENA party passes into opposition,"" Funes said. ""ARENA ... can be assured that it will be listened to and respected."" Although polls had indicated the race had tightened considerably in the past few weeks, most analysts had predicted that Funes would win. ""It's a sign that there's democracy in that country, which is something the United States tried to foster,"" said Bernard Aronson, who as President George H.W. Bush's assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs from 1989-93 was heavily involved in ending El Salvador's 12-year civil war. The FMLN, which is the Spanish acronym for the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, was formed in late 1980 as an umbrella group for five leftist guerilla organizations fighting a U.S.-backed military dictatorship. The guerrillas and the government signed a peace pact in 1992 and the FMLN became a legitimate political party. By some estimates, 75,000 Salvadorans died during the war. The new president will find ""a country that still retains a lot of bitterness, a lot of division,"" said Peter Hakim, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue policy institute. ""This country is completely divided,"" ARENA party official Adolfo Torres said on CNN affiliate TCS TV station Sunday night. The election, Hakim said, was ""an important test of how far El Salvador has come."" The result also will be an important test of how far El Salvador will go. With an economy in deep trouble and neither party having enough seats to control the national Legislative Assembly, much will depend on the party that lost. ""Conflict occurs when one person wants to force a conflict,"" Hakim said. ""Compromise requires both sides."" No one is certain how ARENA will handle the loss. ""That's a big unknown,"" said Heather Berkman, a Latin America analyst with the consulting firm Eurasia Group. ""I still think they'll play ball. They have an incentive to get along with the new administration. They certainly don't want to be shut out of the process."" Otto Reich, who served in high-level Latin American posts for Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, sees the possibility of a spirited fight from ARENA. ""If I had to guess, I'd say ARENA will try to put democratic obstacles in the way of an FMLN consolidation of power,"" Reich said. Although ARENA, which are the Spanish initials for the Nationalist Republican Alliance, has come back from a 14-point deficit in some polls two months ago, Reich said winning a fifth consecutive term was ""swimming against the tide."" ""People in El Salvador are weighing risks and opportunities,"" Reich said. ""They have an opportunity to replace a party with which they have gotten tired."" Hakim also saw voter fatigue with ARENA, saying, ""One party has managed the country forever and ever."" Many of the 2.4 million Salvadorans who voted weighed competing doubts. ""The uncertainty is that the FMLN has never been in power,"" Berkman said. But voters also asked themselves, she said, whether they were ""better off than they were five years ago, 10 years ago."" Avila, she said, could not run on a message of change. Funes' message of change and putting new people in power was more effective. Since the war ended, Salvadorans have mostly supported ARENA because of concerns over the FMLN's left-wing agenda and the group's guerrilla background. There also have been outside influences. ""The country has been afraid to vote for the left because of fears from Washington,"" Larry Birns, director of the nonprofit Council on Hemispheric Affairs, said recently. With the election of Barack Obama as president of the United States, Salvadorans may expect a different attitude from Washington. El Salvador, Colombia and Peru have been the United States' closest allies in Latin America. Birns calls the three nations ""Washington's street-corner guys."" With an FMLN victory, El Salvador joins other Latin American countries that have elected leftist leaders in recent years -- Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Argentina, Honduras, Guatemala, Ecuador and Brazil. But Berkman and others warn that the United States must not lump everyone together. ""People tend to look at the left in Latin America and oversimplify it,"" Berkman said. ""There's the good left and the bad left."" Or as Aronson put it, ""There's leftists, and there's leftists."" Aronson sees two types of leftist governments in Latin America: ""institutional"" governments like Brazil's that ""have made peace with the free market"" while still championing social programs, and populist, more-radical governments like Venezuela's. Analysts are not sure what to make of Funes, a former freelance journalist for CNN en Español who is projecting a moderate image. ""The FMLN did something very clever,"" Reich said. ""They put somebody at the head of the party who is not a guerrilla, not a terrorist."" Even the FMLN may not know what to expect from Funes. Berkman calls it ""an issue of uncertainty"" between the former journalist and the former guerrilla group. ""There's a lot of unknowns about how the relationship between Funes and the FMLN will proceed,"" she said, adding that she will watch his Cabinet picks and whether he brings in people from other parties. Funes' victory was a defining moment for the FMLN. ""It's an important transformation,"" Hakim said. ""The ex-guerrillas have to make a decision: Are they going to try to bring about revolutionary, radical change or manage the whole country and have step-by-step reform?"" Aronson sees it as ""a test of whether they will be pragmatic or ideological."" The FMLN may not have a choice but to be pragmatic. The party holds 35 seats in the 84-member National Assembly. ARENA has 32 seats. Forty-three votes are needed to pass most legislation and some measures require ""supermajority"" approval of 56 votes. That means that, if ARENA and the FMLN cannot agree on a measure, they have to look to one of the minor parties for support. The PCN, which is the National Conciliation Party, has 11 seats and could emerge as a power broker. Two others parties hold six seats. ""It is in the PCN's interest to play ball as well,"" Berkman said. ""The PCN will act as a moderating force."" Berkman also said the FMLN will likely take a moderate approach because the nation relies too much on outside investments and remittances from Salvadorans living abroad for the former guerrillas to adopt too much of a radical approach. But Hakim worries about something else. ""I think ARENA may be prepared for this [loss],"" he said. ""I'm concerned that the FMLN may not be prepared to govern.""","NEW: FMLN's Funes had 51.27 percent of the vote, with 84 percent of ballots counted .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The cause of a deadly Washington Metro subway crash last month remains a mystery, with one problem identified by investigators persisting even after engineers replaced a key part that was believed to be faulty, a top Metro official said Tuesday . Investigators are shown at the crash scene in Washington. Nine people were killed in the June 22 accident. At a congressional hearing, Jim Graham said Metro replaced a device that was ""fluttering,"" signaling the presence of a train one moment and not the next. ""You'd think that that would remedy the issue, that ... we would have solved the problem,"" said Graham, chairman of Metro's board of directors. ""In fact, the new device ... continued the same fluttering as the former device."" ""We're left with a very compelling mystery as to what is going on here,"" he said. The National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation, acknowledged that Metro's system of detecting trains continues to have unexplained, intermittent failures. ""Sometimes it's working; sometimes it's not, even with those changes,"" NTSB member Deborah Hersman told a House committee. ""We've walked back the cable to see if there might be some cabling issues. There's a lot of challenges here and we're changing out some components and trying to identify what the problem is,"" she said. Metro has said it will operate the subway trains on manual control until officials have identified and fixed the problem with the automatic train system. Nine people were killed and scores were injured during the June 22 crash just north of the Red Line's Fort Totten station. At Tuesday's hearing, a passenger on one of the trains gave a dramatic description of the accident. Patrick Tuite of Kensington, Maryland, said he had just put down his newspaper and closed his eyes to relax when he heard a screeching sound, someone yelling and ""one of the loudest bangs I've ever heard in my life."" Tuite said in the impact, he hit the seat in front of him. When Tuite peered into the forward-most car, he saw extensive damage. The floor of the car had collapsed ""accordion-like,"" he said. ""We could hear the people at this point in the first car,"" he said. ""And it was pretty chaotic. They were screaming; they were upset,"" he said. But the collision had jammed the doors between the cars, making it impossible to reach victims in the front car. It wasn't until he got off the train that he realized the first car was thrust into the air, he said. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's Congressional delegate, chided the NTSB for making prohibitively costly safety recommendations while ignoring cheaper, common sense solutions, such as putting the newer, more robust rail cars at the front and back of trains. ""Over and over again, you said, 'Do the impossible,' "" Norton, a Democrat, said, referring to NTSB recommendations that Metro replace older cars with sturdier new ones. ""Why didn't the transportation board at least recommend this rather low-tech, low-cost step?"" Hersman said the NTSB's role is to push for safety improvements. ""We do make recommendations, Ms. Norton, and we don't have to pay for them, so we recognize that frustration,"" she said. ""But our charge is not to [consider costs]. Our charge is to recommend what we think is in the best interest of the safety community. We are the conscience and the compass of the transportation industry, and they [transportation providers and regulators] get to decide if and how they implement it,"" Hersman said.","Unexplained, intermittent failures persist despite repairs, Metro official says .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- There is a shiny addition among the Ottoman mosques and palaces that make up Istanbul's stunning skyline: the metallic, mirrored dome of the new Sakirin Mosque, a Muslim place of worship built with a woman's touch. When sun reflects off Sakirin Mosque's dome, light can be seen across the Bosphorus Strait. For what may be the first time in history, women have been at the forefront of the construction of a mosque in Turkey. One of the project's leaders is Zeynep Fadillioglu, an interior decorator who has designed restaurants, hotels and luxury homes from New Delhi, India, to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, and London, England. She helped organize a team of traditional mosque artists specializing in Islamic calligraphy, along with craftsmen in glassworks, metal-casting and lighting who, like Fadillioglu, have built careers working in exclusively secular architecture and design. ""I want people to feel peaceful and be left with themselves as much as possible and yet have beautiful art and artistic symbolism around them,"" she said. Istanbul has a venerable tradition of mosque architecture, dating back centuries to when Ottoman sultans declared themselves caliph, or spiritual leader of the Muslim world.  Watch Zeynep Fadilioglu show off her work and inspirations » . The shores of the Bosporus Strait are studded with 16th century masterpieces such as the Suleymaniye Mosque, built by the Ottoman Empire's most famous architect, Mimar Sinan, and ornate, neo-Baroque jewels designed by the Armenian Balyan family in the 19th century. But Istanbul's most senior Muslim cleric laments that mosque design suffered a decline after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the wake of World War I. ""In the last 70, 80 years, we have built mosques that are copies of Ottoman architecture,"" said Mustafa Cagrici, the mufti of Istanbul. ""This wasn't a good development, because the copy can never be as good as the original."" Fadillioglu and her team of artists are hoping to change that.  Look at photos of the mosque » . The Sakirin Mosque was commissioned by a wealthy Turkish Arab family and built in one of Istanbul's oldest cemeteries. The designers put a number of contemporary touches on the structure, giving it plate glass walls etched with gold-leaf verses from the Quran, framed by giant cast-iron grids. The mihrab -- the alcove that points worshippers in the direction of Mecca -- is made of asymmetrical ovals, similar to a design used by Fadillioglu to decorate a restaurant in London. And the chandelier is a multi-layered series of metal and plexiglass rings, carrying Quranic inscriptions and dripping with scores of delicate glass teardrops. ""The glass chandelier brings the high dome down to the people,"" Fadillioglu explained. ""So when they pray and kneel they don't feel lost with the light and it shelters them."" Many of the artists here never worked on a mosque before. ""It's special that a woman's hand is involved in this,"" said one of them, a male carpenter named Metin Cekeroglu. ""If you think about it, a home is made by woman. And if we think about this place as a home of God, we can also say women will make this place much better."" Fadillioglu said one of her goals was to bring extra attention into the design of the women's section of the mosque, an area that she says is often neglected by architects. According to Islamic tradition, worshippers are segregated by gender at mosques. ""I have seen mosques where women have been pushed to the worst part of stairs, cramped area. Sort of as if (they are) unwanted in the mosque,"" she said. ""That is not what Islam is about. ... Women are equal in Islam to men"" Five minutes' drive from the Sakirin Mosque stands the Mihrimah Sultan Mosque, a 16th century structure built by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent in honor of his favorite daughter. Unfortunately, female worshippers do not get to enjoy its stunning stained glass windows the way the men do. They have to pray in a small women's section, hidden behind a bank of chest-high shelves that store shoes. At the Sakirin Mosque, Fadillioglu said, she gave women praying on the balcony an unobstructed view of the dome, the ornate chandelier, and the area on the floor where the imam will lead prayers. ""I would like to come here to pray,"" said Elif Demir, an 18-year old art student with a funky, orange-dyed haircut who was working on the chandelier. ""This mosque is completely different because of the light that's coming through the walls, through the glass."" Fadillioglu's role in the Sakirin Mosque is all the more surprising because she comes from a jet-set side of Turkish society not normally associated with Islam. ""It is unusual,"" she conceded, ""because first of all not many modern people have been commissioned to design a mosque."" She spoke in a recent interview at Ulus 29, the expensive Istanbul hilltop restaurant and bar that is owned by her husband. Amid the Ottoman- and Selcuk-inspired flourishes she has sprinkled around the restaurant are echoes of designs seen at the Sakirin Mosque. A glass chandelier made of hundreds of crystal tear drops hangs above the bar, similar in style to the mosque's chandelier. Fadillioglu said being a night club owner does not prevent her from also being a Muslim. ""You might be surprised in Turkey to find some very modern-looking people being very religious at the same time,"" she said. Religion is a hot-button political issue in Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country with a strict secular system of government. For the past eight years a fierce power struggle has been under way between an urban secular elite and a rising new class of religiously conservative Turks from the Anatolian heartlands. Unlike the wives of Turkey's Islamic-rooted president and prime minister, Fadillioglu does not wear the Islamic headscarf that is often seen as the symbol of this new class of Turks. Fadillioglu said politics have polarized society. ""In my childhood ... you didn't differentiate between who was religious,"" she explained. ""Whoever wants to worship or visit this mosque, its open, its ready for them."" On May 8, Turkey's prime minister attended an inauguration ceremony for the Sakirin Mosque. Afterward, in an interview with CNN, the mufti of Istanbul called it the start of a new era of mosque design in Turkey. ""It is in Islamic tradition for women to commission mosques ... and now we have women who are building mosques as well,"" Cagrici said. ""God willing, I hope the world will see more of these beautiful mosques, touched by women's hands.""","For possibly first time in history, women take lead in building mosque in Turkey .

"Editor's note: Kathleen Sebelius is secretary of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration. Kathleen Sebelius says health care costs are a huge and growing burden on the economy. (CNN) -- Today in Washington, some politicians like to suggest that the many challenges we face as a nation mean we shouldn't tackle health care reform. Nothing could be further from the truth. With more and more of America's families, businesses, and local, state and federal governments struggling with the crushing costs of health care, health care reform has never been more important. As President Obama has often said, you can't fix the economy without fixing health care. Unless we fix what is broken in our current system, everyone's health care will be in jeopardy. Health care reform is not a luxury. It is a necessity. It's important to look at the size of the problem we face and where we stand. Today, we have by far the most expensive health system in the world. We spend 50 percent more per person on health care than the average developed country, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. We spend more on health care than housing or food, the McKinsey Global Institute reported. Nearly 46 million Americans are uninsured, millions more are underinsured, and they aren't the only ones who are suffering. The high cost of care is hurting all of us. A recent study by Families USA estimates that insured families pay a hidden health tax of more than $1,000 every year. The hidden tax is the amount businesses and families with insurance have to pay in insurance premiums, taxes and donations to help cover the cost of treating uninsured Americans. Health insurance premiums for families that are covered through a job at a small business have increased 85 percent since 2000, and more small businesses are thinking about dropping health insurance benefits. Nationwide, health care costs consume 18 percent of our gross domestic product. If we continue on our current path, health care costs will consume 34 percent of our GDP by 2040, and the number of uninsured Americans will rise to 72 million, according to the Council of Economic Advisers. Even though we spend more than any other nation on health care, we aren't healthier. Only three developed countries have higher infant mortality rates. Our nation ranks 24th in life expectancy among developed countries. More than one-third of Americans are obese. These statistics are the signs of a system that is both unacceptable and unsustainable. They also show us the high cost of doing nothing. If we choose the status quo, more Americans will be uninsured, costs will continue to rise, and every American's health care will be at risk. Inaction is not an option, and reform is long overdue. The Obama administration is working to enact reform that will reduce costs for families, businesses and government; protect people's choice of doctors, hospitals and health plans; and assure affordable, quality health care for all Americans. We are guided by a simple principle: Protect what works about health care and fix what's broken, and do it in a way that does not add to the deficit. The president has already introduced proposals that will provide $950 billion over 10 years in savings to finance health care reform. Much of these resources come from wringing waste out of the current system and aggressively prosecuting fraud and abuse. We will continue to work with Congress as it explores other financing options, and the president is open to ideas about how we finance health care reform. But we are not open to deficit spending. Health care reform will be paid for, and it will be deficit-neutral over 10 years. Working together, we can pass real health care reform that gives Americans the choices they deserve and the affordable, quality coverage they need. And we know they do not want us to wait. Too many people have suffered without basic medical care or paid too much for it. For years, the American people have called on Washington to meet this challenge. They have waited long enough. The time for reform is now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathleen Sebelius.","Kathleen Sebelius: Health care represents growing burden on economy .

"(CNN)  -- The body of a woman was found near her car Wednesday, the apparent victim of an ammonia leak from a nearby plant in Swansea, South Carolina, police said. The leak occurred at the Tanner Industries plant as a hose had been connected from a delivery trailer containing anhydrous ammonia (purified ammonia) to a storage tank in the facility, said David Binder, director of quality safety and regulatory affairs for Tanner Industries. ""During that operation, a hole burst in the hose,"" he said. ""That released ammonia gas."" The leak from the plant, located about 24 miles south of Columbia, was reported to the Lexington County Sheriff's Department shortly before 8 a.m., said Maj. John Allard, a public information officer for the department. Firefighters arrived within 10 minutes at the plant, where they saw a large, light-colored, dense plume, and closed area roads to traffic, he said. The ammonia hovered first over U.S. 321, then moved into a wooded area, blackening its foliage, Allard said. Public safety personnel searched the vicinity for any people or animals affected by the leak, and -- at 9:30 a.m. -- found the woman's body next to her vehicle, which was parked on the side of U.S. 321, he said. Officials were speculating that the woman had been driving north when she encountered the plume and tried to turn around, but her car stalled. She apparently got out of the vehicle and was overcome by the fumes, Allard said. An autopsy has been ordered. The woman's name was not released pending notification of her family. Seven people were taken to Lexington County Medical Center in stable condition with respiratory problems, none of which was life-threatening, Allard said. Five were plant workers; the other two were nearby residents. The road was reopened at 2 p.m., after the plume had dissipated, he said. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board -- an independent agency charged with investigating industrial chemical accidents -- announced it is deploying an investigation team to the site of the ammonia release. Tanner's Binder described the occurrence as ""tragic,"" adding that nothing similar had occurred in the plant's more than 13 years of existence. ""This is just heart-wrenching,"" he said, adding that there were no immediate plans to reopen the plant. Ammonia, a strong irritant that affects the respiratory system, is used in a variety of industries, including the manufacture of fertilizers and in commercial refrigeration systems.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- He immortalized the ""smell of napalm in the morning"" in ""Apocalypse Now,"" but Robert Duvall's first meeting with director Francis Ford Coppola was no indication of the fruitful relationship to come. Duvall starred in Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather,"" ""The Godfather: Part II"" and ""Apocalypse Now."" It was 1969 and Coppola had parted ways with a lead character in indie film ""The Rain People."" He was stuck and 38-year-old Duvall was drafted in at the last minute on the suggestion of a friend. Despite slapdash beginnings, their work together has produced some of Duvall's greatest roles and many of Coppola's most critically-acclaimed films. Duvall started working in theater in the 1950s before moving into film in the early 1960s with roles like Boo Radley in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Things took off for him in 1970s when he starred in Coppola's multiple award-winning movies ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II,"" But, it is his Oscar-nominated turn as indestructible, napalm-loving Lt. Colonel Kilgore in Coppola's Vietnam war opus ""Apocalypse Now"" that remains one of Duvall's most enduring roles. Duvall sits down with CNN's Revealed and talks about, ""Apocalypse Now"" and his relationship with the master movie-maker. Revealed: Can you sum up the impact Coppola had on your life, your career? RD: I would have had another career. He helped all our careers with ""The Godfather."" It was a kind of catalyst for all the actors in one and two. It helped me. I kinda designed my own career. Revealed: What's Coppola's approach to directing? RD: I think sometimes Francis works best amidst confusion and I mean that in a good way. He'll come in and say, 'Let's try something,' and then you rehearse. Like any good director he sees what you bring. He realizes it's gotta come from the actor. He's open enough ... of course, he'll give his opinion but he wants to see what you bring. Revealed: The problems Coppola encountered while shooting ""Apocalypse Now"" are legendary. What was it like working on that film? RD: There are things I won't go into! But it was pretty crazy. Sometimes we'd get one shot in a day, if that. Everything was in disarray. The hurricane came in and ruined the sets, s**t! Then they had to build them again, and we were there nine or 10 months. Dennis Hopper all doped up, not doing it Francis' way. Francis would do 45 takes, and then he said, 'Now, would you please do one my way,"" he'd say to Dennis. Martin Sheen got the heart attack, and they didn't know what they would do if they lost Martin. Francis said it was like warfare.  Watch Coppola and others talk about the making of ""Apocalypse Now"" » . Revealed: You say that people constantly come up to you in the street and say the line, 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning.' RD: It is a pretty famous line. Everybody relates to that line. Scenes like that we had to get quickly because all that fire at the back of me was supposed to be the napalm. Sometimes when you work fast and under duress ... sometimes that's the best stuff you can get. Revealed: How did your life change after ""Apocalypse Now,"" and the ""Godfather"" films came out? RD: It was kind of a landmark. I said we're in something pretty important here, as far as film goes and it was true, and I gained a lot of respect for Francis because I didn't know him that well on ""The Rain People."" It's Coppola's vision. It could have been made by Disney as long as he was directing it. Which one of Coppola's films would you put in a time capsule for future generations? Tell us below in the SoundOff box . Revealed: What is it about Coppola that makes him such a great director? RD: A guy like Coppola, you know, as a director, he wants to see what you bring, without dictating. He's not a dictator. He has a definite vision, but he's not going to get in there and say it has to be my way or the highway. He really wants to see what you bring. He'll say, 'Come on guys quit fooling around we gotta make a movie!' You branch off into laughing and making jokes, but that's good for the set and he knows that too. It's his own gift and it's his own way of working. Revealed: Coppola says now he wants to make small, intimate movies he has written himself. What's your take on that? RD: He's a big spender. Now he's making all the wine and everything else, he can go back to independent film. Why not? He said ""The Conversation"" was his favorite film. It was certainly one of his best, I think. Why not go back to what he started out as? In the 1970s it was as if the independent filmmaking community was within the establishment. Now it's back outside the establishment starting to make the kind of films he started out doing. Revealed: Can you describe Francis in a few words? RD: A talented maniac. No, no, not a maniac, but he's a talented, driven guy. He's a heavy hitter.","Actor Robert Duvall first worked with Francis Ford Coppola 40 years ago .

"(CNN) -- The death of a Canadian soldier in battle-scarred Afghanistan on Thursday brings this month's toll of international military fatalities in the war to 47, the highest monthly tally so far, a CNN count of official statistics shows. Lt. Col Thorneloe was  one of 15 British troops killed in action in Afghanistan this month. The Canadian soldier was killed while he was conducting operations in the Panjwayi District in Kandahar province, the Canadian military said. The previous monthly record was 46, a mark reached twice last year, in June and August. The growing death toll, which only accounts for the first half of July, comes amid an uptick in fighting across Afghanistan, where international forces and Afghan troops have been battling the Taliban. The push, called Operation Khanjar, targets militants in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold and poppy-growing region. The forces are trying to gain and hold ground in the perilous region ahead of national elections this August. Some of the deaths resulted from nonhostile incidents such as accidents, but most have occurred during hostilities. According to a CNN count of figures from various governments, the U.S.-led coalition and NATO's International Security Assistance Force, the deaths in July have included 23 Americans, 15 Britons, five Canadians, two Turks, an Italian and a NATO-led soldier whose nationality has not yet been disclosed. The news coincides with another grim milestone for the British military, which has seen the number of troops killed in Afghanistan surpass the death toll in the Iraq War. An especially bloody 10 days in Afghanistan's Helmand province, the staging ground for several major recent offensives, claimed the lives of 15 British soldiers in July, putting the number of the country's dead in Afghanistan at 184, the Defense Ministry said. The British military has lost 179 soldiers in Iraq. The 15 deaths in July also put the British military on track to be the deadliest month yet for British troops supporting Operation Enduring Freedom. Britain's deadliest month in Afghanistan so far has been September 2006, when 19 died -- 14 in a single incident, the crash of a Royal Air Force plane near Kandahar. Since the United States launched Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan in 2001, 652 U.S. troops have died in hostile and nonhostile activities throughout the country.","Soldier's death in Kandahar operations brings monthly international death toll to 47 .

"(CNN) -- Doctor James Braude leads a group medical practice in an elegant Atlanta, Georgia, office decorated with designer furnishings. It doesn't look like a charity asking for handouts. But it is asking. Obama, pictured July 1 in Virginia, has been touring the states to promote his plan to voters. ""On some days we've counted up to 30 patients a day who've lost their jobs and their health insurance,"" Braude said. So Braude and his colleagues offer as much free care as they can afford. The doctors have also begun discreetly inviting paying patients to contribute to a fund, helping more people get care they haven't got the money for. ""We're doctors. We're addicted to helping people. And when we can't, we go through withdrawal."" Millions of Americans have always gone without the kind of routine medical care that is seen as a basic right in many countries. The U.S. economic downturn -- meaning people lose health insurance when they lose their job -- and the election of President Barack Obama have coincided to increase both the need and the opportunity to address the plight of uninsured America. Obama's ambition is to provide insurance for the estimated 50 million Americans without coverage.  Watch why many in rural U.S. have concerns » . The insurance is expected to cover doctors, hospital care and prescription drugs. But just about every detail is still being negotiated so it's not certain who would be covered, what they would be covered for or whether people who don't want insurance would be forced to have it and pay for it. The plans that emerge could become the Obama administration's most ambitious domestic program and potentially a big, early test of his presidency. American medical care needs attention . Even though nearly 50 million of its roughly 300 million people have no routine health care, the United States spends more going to the doctor than any other industrialized nation in the world. Fully one-sixth of the economy is devoted to it. Under the current hybrid system, the U.S. Government pays for health care for ex-military, the extremely poor and the elderly. But the vast majority of Americans have to pay for their own health care and most do it where they work; many employers arrange health insurance and partly subsidize the premiums. The rapidly rising cost is crushing all kinds of businesses, from car companies to family farms. At the same time, hospitals and doctors say they are falling behind because the payments they receive from insurance companies aren't keeping up with their costs. ""Within a decade we will be spending one out of every five dollars we earn on health care,"" Obama said recently. ""In 30 years, it will be one out of every three. That is untenable, that is unacceptable, and I will not allow it as president of the United States."" The politics: Deep disagreement . There is a lot of disagreement about what to do. Congress has the job of actually turning the push for change into a functioning government program. Democratic lawmakers don't all support the president's plan or agree on how to pay for it. Republicans are split in a different way. Some lawmakers are trying to influence the Democrats' plans and others are proposing entirely different alternatives. ""If you look at their plan, it really is a big government-run plan that will take control of the delivery of health care in America,"" said Republican congressional leader John Boehner. His suggestion: ""Improve the current system so it works better."" The most profound disagreement centers on whether Washington should create its own new health-insurance concern to compete with the private companies that provide insurance now. Obama and many Democrats favor it; Republicans are dead set against it. Part of the problem is that insurance companies fear the government will put them out of business, by favoring or subsidizing its own scheme. The other part of the problem is more basic and ideological. The U.S. government already runs enormous health-insurance programs for the poor, the elderly and military veterans -- but many Americans see potentially mandatory government health-insurance as the foreign-born offspring of socialist states. The economics: More debt . Political opposition notwithstanding, the economics are going to be a problem too. Health care is a $2 trillion-dollar-a-year industry that would have to expand to cover millions of people who are now uninsured. The president has some ideas for new efficiencies but most estimates suggest the total cost of caring for Americans would rise dramatically. Washington is already carrying record debt and would have to find a way to pay for it. One assessment by the Congressional Budget Office of the Senate Democrat plan estimated it would cost more than $1 trillion over 10 years and only provide coverage for about 16 million Americans. There's also the possibility that the impact of reform on many employers and virtually every wage-earner across the country will have a spillover effect on the economy as a whole, still lodged in recession. The health care industry: Undecided . Then there is the place where the politics and the economy overlap: the health care industry. Doctors alone have spent roughly two-thirds of a billion dollars lobbying lawmakers in the last 10 years, according to the independent Center for Responsive Politics. Add pharmaceutical companies and hospitals, nurses and other health care professionals and you get one of the most influential forces in U.S. politics. They successfully organized to defeat health care reform when the Clinton administration tried it 15 years ago. The industry benefits from one crucial thing: Americans like their doctors. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released July 1 found 54 percent of people worry that their health care costs would go up if the administration's proposals get passed and only one in five thinks that his or her families would be better off under the Obama plan. With all that in mind, Atlanta's Dr. Braude says he's optimistic the reform can succeed. If not, he says, ""we go back to the same system and we have 50 million people without insurance, which means you are one brain tumor away from bankruptcy.""","About 50 million Americans are without any health insurance .
People losing jobs in the recession also lose health insurance .
Government health provision care largely confined to veterans, elderly and poor .
Extending government role is health care is politically hot potato ."
"(CNN) -- It turns out going to the moon is a tough act to follow. Astronaut Buzz Aldrin walks on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. For all their Buck Rogers, ""Right Stuff,"" history-making achievements, the question for many of the 12 astronauts who walked on the lunar surface starting four decades ago ultimately became ""one giant leap to where, exactly?"" ""You have your peak experience at 38 or 39,"" says space historian Andrew Chaiken, summing up their collective experience, ""and [they] have a hard time coming up with something to do for an encore."" Apollo 11 lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on July 16, 1969. Four days later, the first two humans walked on the lunar surface; 10 more Americans followed by the end of 1972. In the 40 years since the Apollo program first took humans to the moon, the astronauts' lives have taken diverse paths. Almost all had been military test pilots before joining NASA; in later life, they found themselves ministers, politicians and conspiracy buffs. Some struggled with common issues: Many of their marriages fell apart and alcoholism affected at least one. In possibly the most extreme case of post-Apollo readjustment, Buzz Aldrin -- the second human being to set foot on the moon -- became a car salesman in Texas. ""Not very successfully,"" the 79-year old Aldrin quickly acknowledges. The Apollo 11 lunar module pilot's post-flight battles against depression and alcoholism have been well-documented, most recently in his own memoir, ""Magnificent Desolation."" As for a brief stint hawking Cadillacs in the late 1970s, Aldrin told CNN Radio, ""Most people who have received a degree of public recognition find themselves financially pretty well off. Doesn't happen to be the case with astronauts."" Others took more existential, even spiritual, approaches to dealing with their lunar experiences. Apollo 15 Lunar Module Pilot Jim Irwin left NASA and became a Baptist minister. Apollo 14 crewman Edgar Mitchell spent years investigating possible extraterrestrial life; in April, he went public with claims of a government cover-up. Apollo 12 moonwalker Alan Bean, now 77, has spent the intervening decades since his 1969 landing putting his impressions of the lunar experience on canvas. ""That's How It Felt To Walk on the Moon"" is the title of one his paintings, which now fetch starting-prices of $20,000. ""These paintings are the only paintings in history from anywhere else but this Earth,"" Bean told CNN. Not all the Apollo astronauts' post-flight journeys have been so ethereal. America's first man in space, Alan Shepard, who later walked on the moon in 1971's Apollo 14 mission, became a millionaire businessman. Apollo 17's Harrison Schmitt -- a geologist at the time, and the only scientist to make the lunar journey -- served a term as U.S. senator from New Mexico, but was defeated in a run for re-election in 1982. Apollo 11 command module pilot Michael Collins served as a top official at the Smithsonian Institution and its National Air and Space Museum. And the first man to leave footprints in the lunar dust, Apollo 11 Commander Neil Armstrong -- aside from geologist Schmitt, the only other civilian in the collection of moonwalkers -- later sat on several corporate boards and the presidential commission that investigated the 1986 Challenger space shuttle disaster. Armstrong is also known for a series of disputes over autographs, which he long ago stopped signing because he discovered his signature was being sold for profit. He also sued Hallmark in 1994 for featuring his famous ""One small step"" quote in a space-themed Christmas ornament. News reports say the suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. Armstrong's haircuts also became famous. In 2005, he threatened legal action after learning his longtime barber had sold a lock of his hair for $3,000. All part of the territory, says Chaiken. His book ""Voices From the Moon"" is based upon interviews with the surviving Apollo astronauts, and he concludes there's no ""lunar syndrome"" that's sent the moonwalkers down paths odder than any dozen former colleagues in other lines of work. ""I think the whole subject of the effects of going to the moon is something that gets overstated,"" Chaiken says. If there is a common emotion among the astronauts, four decades after the Apollo achievement, it may be simple disappointment over space exploration -- or the lack of it. ""It's all fallen apart,"" Aldrin says, talking about what may prove a half-century gap between American lunar landings. ""We have just taken the wrong pathway."" Chaiken agrees this is a near-universal astronaut refrain. ""They really have never expected that it would be this long. That here we would be -- 40 years after the first moon landing -- still wondering when humans will return to the moon. I think they're all frustrated by that."" CNN's John Zarrella contributed to this report.","A dozen men walked on the moon, and each later followed a different path .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- First lady Michelle Obama's father is not buried in the Chicago-area cemetery where investigators say hundreds of graves have been dug up in a scheme to resell the burial plots, a spokeswoman said Tuesday. First lady Michelle Obama's father is not buried in the Chicago-area cemetery where graves were disturbed. The announcement followed an earlier, mistaken statement by the first lady's communications director, Camille Johnston. Johnston later said that Obama's father, Fraser Robinson III, was buried in Lincoln Cemetery in suburban Alsip, Illinois, not the Burr Oak graveyard now at the center of a criminal investigation. ""There has been some confusion that has been cleared up,"" Johnston said. Robinson, who worked as a pump operator for the Chicago water department, died in 1991 after a long struggle with multiple sclerosis. Lincoln Cemetery is about 2 miles from Burr Oak. Four people face felony charges in the investigation surrounding Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois. Authorities said last week that about 300 graves had been disturbed as part of the scheme, but that number is expected to rise. Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart said his office has received more than 55,000 requests for information from families with loved ones buried in Burr Oak. But he said many of the cemetery's records are in rusted cabinets filled with decaying file cards. ""Most of the file cards have rotted together,"" he said. ""They're covered in mold, and they've rotted together."" In addition, some of the cemetery's books are missing pages, and others are known to have been altered, ""So this has made it incredibly difficult for us to give accurate information,"" Dart said. His office asked a court Tuesday to appoint a receiver to manage the graveyard, which he said has been run by his office since last week. Among others buried in the 150-acre graveyard are civil rights martyr Emmett Till, blues pioneer Willie Dixon, jazz and blues singer Dinah Washington and several Negro League baseball players. Cemetery groundskeepers told investigators that Till's grave was not among those disturbed, but the identities of other remains dug up have not been disclosed. Carolyn Towns, an office manager for the cemetery, and gravediggers Keith Nicks, Terrance Nicks and Maurice Daley have each been charged with dismembering a human body. The felony charge carries a sentence ranging from six to 30 years, authorities said. Authorities began investigating the cemetery about six weeks ago after receiving a call from its owners, who said they suspected ""financial irregularities"" regarding the business, Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart told CNN last week. He said the owners are not believed to be involved in the alleged scam. CNN correspondents Dan Lothian and Elaine Quijano contributed to this report.","NEW: Official corrects confusion, says Michelle Obama's dad not buried at cemetery .

"(AOL Autos) -- Chrysler and General Motors announced this week that they would shrink their dealer base in the U.S. Chrysler will close 789 dealers. General Motors announced the closing of 1,100 dealers. Chrysler will close 789 dealers, leaving them with approximately 2400 stores in the U.S. General Motors announced the closing of 1,100 dealers and hopes to be at a size of 3,600 dealers at the end of 2010. While Chrysler dealers will be ""forced out"" by June 9, GM is positioning for a smoother closing of its stores, with each shutting down when it runs out of inventory. Unlike Chrysler's announcement, GM's list of closing dealers will not be made public, leaving that decision to each dealer. What happens to my GM or Chrysler vehicle warranty? Your warranty is valid through its term, regardless of where you bought your vehicle. In March, President Obama announced that the U.S. government would provide the backing for Chrysler and GM vehicle warranties under the ""Warrantee Commitment Program."" Can I take my vehicle for service and warranty work to another (surviving) dealer? Yes, but make sure it's a certified dealer. If you're going to take your Chrysler, Jeep or Dodge vehicle in for warranty work, you can do so at a closing dealership until June 9. After that time, Chrysler will no longer pay those dealers for warranty work. GM vehicles will receive service and warranty work at closing dealers until they shut down. Will there be good deals on these vehicles? The Chrysler dealerships to close will have about 44,000 units on hand, or roughly what Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge sell across the country every 2-3 weeks (using April's sales numbers as a guide). There will be deals, but be warned that if those 44,000 aren't sold before June 9, Chrysler will work to redistribute them to other dealers. Whether the best deals will be had before or after June 9 is likely negligible; if you're interested in a Chrysler, Jeep or Dodge product, you will save a lot of money on a new purchase right now. One important factor to keep in mind is that approximately 10% of those remaining units are 2008 vehicles. Be careful the car you're looking at hasn't been sitting on the lot inactive for too long; cars actually do ""rot."" GM's dealer announcement is a different story, since the company isn't releasing the names of the closing dealers. Dealers who chose to disclose their shutdown may provide better deals. AOL Autos: Why do cars rot on the lot? How many people and jobs are affected by closing dealers? The impact on communities will be significant. Since dealers typically employ about 50 people and contract with a handful of suppliers (consider the business that sells paper or office furniture to each dealer), there will be impact within the community. Some economists, however, believe that the impact will be less than expected, since dealers typically have a high turnover rate and technician jobs were in a short supply already. But, the related aspects of dealer closings are certain: think of the little league baseball teams and charities that receive funding from do-gooding dealers. Even real estate is affected; car dealerships usually set the market for commercial real estate in smaller communities. When those go empty, the entire city feels the pain. AOL Autos: Pressure to buy American . Why were these dealers chosen? Both Chrysler and GM have expressed interest to shrink their dealer base. Company officials cite various data points related to choosing these dealers, but the main one is performance. GM said that the average dealer of the 1,100 affected only sold 35 cars in all of 2008. Chrysler cites similar numbers, with half their closing dealerships selling less than 100. But, even after these reductions by Chrysler and GM, they still have more dealers than other manufacturers. Using April 2009's sales data as a proxy, Toyota has approximately 95 dealers per 1 point of market share in the U.S., while Chrysler has 256 and GM will have 172 (at the end of 2010). This means that, effectively, Toyota is able to sell more vehicles per dealership. AOL Autos: Fate of the GM brands . Can dealers do anything about this? Typically, dealers would have protection under state franchise laws against such events. However, in Chrysler's case, those franchise laws are not applicable since the company declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Chrysler dealers can (and likely will) protest the process by which they were chosen (sales volume, number of brands in the store, the area in which the dealership operated). But after June 9, the selected Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge dealers will have to take down their signs. GM dealers will likely organize their own group, but details of that are unclear at this time. AOL Autos: Are extended warranties worth it? Even after cuts, do the big three still have too many U.S. dealers? Some companies need fewer dealers to sell the same amount of cars: . Chrysler LLC  Number of dealers: 2411  Market share: 9.4  Dealers per 1 pt. market share: 256 . Ford Motor Co.  Number of dealers: 3723  Market share: 15.7  Dealers per 1 pt. market share: 237 .

"(CNN) -- The average American woman can live long enough to celebrate her 80th birthday, so if a woman is able to become pregnant using in vitro fertilization with a donor egg at 56, she could still watch her child grow into an adult. But just because it's possible, does that mean she should? Some feel that having children after 45 is unfair because the parents might not live to see the kids become adults. The death of 69-year-old Maria del Carmen Bousada of Spain, who used in vitro fertilization with a donor egg to have twin boys at 66, has the fertility treatment community bracing for a backlash. It could rival the fallout from octuplet mom Nadya Suleman -- and it seems to have already started. In a national online survey about fertility conducted in May by Johnson & Johnson's Babycenter.com, 7 out of 10 moms who responded wanted tougher regulation laws for IVF treatments, and half of the 1,095 respondents thought it was bad for the children if a parent conceived past 45. Fertility specialists understand those concerns, but they say it's not that simple. Although it's rare for anyone older than 55 to get the go-ahead for IVF, that guideline is peer-enforced rather than mandated, and decisions typically are made on a case-by-case basis. Georgia Dardick, an advertising executive in Boynton Beach, Florida, was one of those cases. Dardick tried to conceive via IVF six times and seriously considered adoption, but at 51, she wasn't ready to let go of her desire to have a baby. ""Fifty was the cutoff for my doctor, but they agreed to give us one more try,"" she said. She had her daughter in January. Dardick said she never planned to have a baby at 51, but feels that she made the right decision, despite the judgments others may have. ""The word selfish has come into my mind. But for any parent, having a child is selfish. No matter what your age is, once you have that child, you owe that child everything. I live the best, healthiest life I can."" Doctors say society's views of aging needs to change. ""The 40 and 45-year-old of today is not the 40-year-old of the past; the 50-year-old [today] is not the same of the past,"" said Dr. John Jain, a physician at the Santa Monica (California) Fertility Clinic who has treated age-related infertility for 15 years. ""They're eating healthy. A woman who is 45 is barely halfway through [her] life."" Healthy or not, having a child at that age can cause tremendous stress on the body. Candidates for IVF after 45 use either an egg donor or their own frozen embryos from a prior cycle and are screened for underlying medical problems, such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension or lung disease, said Dr. Charles Coddington of the Mayo Clinic's reproductive endocrinology department in Rochester, Minnesota. Still, ""if somebody were in good health, it would be hard to say, 'you shouldn't have a baby,' "" he said. ""One has to judge where they are, health-wise and financially."" But if a woman who claims to be 55 is actually in her mid-60s -- as Bousada reportedly did -- what's a doctor to do? Not much, physicians say.  Watch report on death of 69-year-old mother » . ""The truth may get dimmed to fit into the realm of a patient that may be acceptable. I don't sit there and say, 'Go get your birth certificate.' If someone's coming in and they're saying they're 52 or 55, I take it at face value,"" Coddington said, who does refer questionable cases to the fertility center's ethics board. Even for those who choose to use it, the availability of this technology can be a double-edged sword. Dardick said she wouldn't change anything, but if she did have to do it all over again, she said she may have considered adoption earlier. ""In a way, there's this hope always out there for you, and once you get into it, it's harder to break away,"" she said. It's the intense desire to have a biological child that Manhattan-based psychotherapist Joan Wingroad, who specializes in fertility issues for women 40 and older, has been treating for 20 years. ""I work with women who've been very successful. They went to the right schools, got married and they feel that everything comes to you if you work hard. But then they realize pregnancy doesn't happen that way,"" said Wingroad. She helps her clients find balance -- and limits -- by creating a plan: How long should they try IVF? How long until they consider adoption or child-free living? ""They need that."" Wingroad said, ""because many times a doctor will say, 'Look, this is your money, this is your dream; who am I to say that you can't do it anymore.'"" While doctors do help women try to reach their dream, Jain said he isn't afraid to tell a patient ""no"" if they simply aren't healthy enough -- or are just too old. But, Jain said, it's all based on his judgment as a trained physician. ""Ninety-five percent of us do a great job about regulating ourselves. I personally don't want to see more regulation, because it becomes problematic, and it can be more costly. Someone who's failed three cycles and [has already spent] $50,000 -- with the next cycle, will I be more aggressive? Certainly,"" Jain said. ""But maybe there's a middle ground, if the rule is that donor IVF will not be offered for women over 55 years of age. Regulations at the extremes might be useful."" Even though Dardick plans on living her life as a new mom for quite some time, she said having a baby at her age isn't ideal. She and her husband are taking careful precautions by adjusting their financial planning to make sure their daughter will be financially secure. They're also tightening bonds with extended family and friends, should anything happen to her or her husband -- a decision Bousada may have made as well, as her twin boys are now in the custody of a relative. Those, Dardick said, are the decisions one has to make when having a child later in life. """"People feel that it's not fair to the child because you may not live long enough,"" Dardick said. But as someone who lost a father as a teenager, she knows ""there are no guarantees in life.""","If a woman is in good health, she can conceive and give birth into her 50s .
