"Sinitta has finally set the record straight about the 'heartbreaking' abortion she and Simon Cowell went through together in the 1980s. After a week which has seen her launch a number of extraordinary rants regarding the pair's relationship via her Twitter page, the 49-year-old singer has opened up about the termination that left she and the music mogul utterly 'devastated'. The So Macho hitmaker dismissed reports claiming the incident happened behind the back of the 53-year-old television boss, explaining that on the contrary, it was something that they mutually decided when they were 'both young'. 'Devastating': Sinitta has finally set the record straight about the 'heartbreaking' abortion she and Simon Cowell went through together in the 1980s . News of the abortion originally broke last month, when Sinitta revealed the tragic news to The Mirror. However, Sinitta later said that the publication didn't give her the opportunity to 'defend' her decision, as well as denying suggestions that the termination took place as recently as 2009. Sinitta added that she made the decision to have an abortion because she was already aware of health issues that meant she was unable to 'carry a child full term'. Speaking in an interview with The Sun, Sinitta said: 'Simon was very concerned and by my side. It was upsetting and it was something very difficult that we dealt with together.' Simon and Sinitta dated on and off for 20 years, but the mother-of-two admitted the termination wasn't something they discussed regularly throughout their friendship. In happier times: The 49-year-old singer has opened up about the termination that left she and the music mogul utterly 'devastated' Firm friends: Cowell and Sinitta dated on and off for twenty years after meeting in the 1980s . The 80s pop star explained . she helped to deal with her loss by getting a puppy, but that didn't . stop her still longing to have a child with the X Factor boss. She added: 'I have always admitted I wanted to marry him and have children with him - not just because I love him, but because I thought it would be good for him.' Simon is now expecting a child with his American socialite girlfriend, Lauren Silverman, while Sinitta adopted Magdalena, eight, and Zac, seven, with her ex-husband Andy Willner. However, Sinitta confessed she was both 'shocked and surprised' when Simon called her to break the news that he was set to be a father earlier this year. Daddy to be: The 53-year-old star is now expecting his first child with American socialite Lauren Silverman, something which Sinitta admitted 'worried' her initially . She told The Sun's Colin Robertson: 'I was stunned and taken aback, surprised. I was worried about him because he never wanted to have kids and now this was happening. I thought it was a problem initially.' Sinitta admitted seeing him happy with Lauren has been a 'big adjustment', particularly as she used to consider the 36-year-old brunette as 'like a sister' to her. But she explained the two women had a chat at Simon's villa in the South of France in August to smooth things over once and for all. She added: 'She's in love with him,and he's in love with her. I'm happy for them and I mean that.' Close friends: Simon and Sinitta dated on and off for 20 years and have remained extremely close ever since . Despite stating that she still loves her former flame, Sinitta insisted she is no longer 'in love' with Simon and wishes the couple 'happiness' for the next 'fascinating' stage of their life together. Earlier this week, the singer appealed directly to ITV host Jeremy Kyle, offering to take a lie detector test live on air to apparently prove her allegations regarding Simon and their unborn child. Launching another extraordinary rant on her Twitter page, Sinitta said: 'Jeremy kyle, I know I declined your celebrity chat, but I'd love to do your show PROVIDED you provide a lie detection device.. #thisHAStoEnd.

"James Milner has responded to Paul Scholes' suggestion that Manchester City's recent struggles have stemmed from underestimating their opponents. Prior to Sunday's Manchester derby, which City won 1-0, the former Manchester United midfielder claimed: 'There is something about them (City).' 'You may even call it a touch of arrogance - that they don't have to take their opposition into consideration.' James Milner (centre) has hit back at Paul Scholes' claims that Manchester City are undermining other teams . Milner admitted that although City have put in some mediocre performances, the team is sure it can improve . The former Manchester United midfielder accused local rivals City of being 'arrogant' towards their opposition . Quick to dispel the accusations, City midfielder Milner came out to show his support for his manager and team-mates. 'We go out there with a game plan, and if we hit our standards we can beat anyone - we've proved that.' Milner also reflected on City's recent below-par performances, with their derby win the first in four games after losses to Newcastle and West Ham. 'We've not been at our strongest over the last few weeks, and the players know that. It's down to us to change that, and the derby win will go a long way to changing it. Manchester United's Chris Smalling (right) sends Milner flying during Sunday's Premier League derby clash . 'We didn't play as well as we can but it was all about the win.' With a busy schedule ahead in the lead up to the festive period, the 28-year-old sees that there is certainly room for improvement, and that getting the wins is imperative for them to get back to form. 'We can improve performance-wise, but it was all about getting a win and Wednesday is the same. We have to get three points and if we play to our level we will.' 'It's a busy period now - we have an international break coming up but then games come thick and fast and Christmas is always a tough time. 'The league table always seems to change dramatically going into December, and again coming out of it.

"The popular children's cartoon SuperTed is set to be remade following an absence of more than 30 years from Britain's television screens. A decision has been made by the BBC, which screened the show in the 1980s, to produce 26 new episodes which will air in 2016. However the show's characters, which featured 'a fat guy who had jokes made about his weight', will be toned down for a modern audience. Time to say the secret magic words: 1980s children's cartoon SuperTed is set to return to television screens following a remake suitable for a modern audience . Danger Mouse - The 1980s animated TV series which featured a mouse who worked as a secret agent is set to return on CBBC in 2015. The Teletubbies - A 1990s show whose alien characters had TV sets implanted in their abdomens will show on CBBC though it is not known when the new episodes will be broadcast. Thunderbirds - The 1960s science fiction series which featured marionette puppetry will air on ITV in 2015. The Wombles - TV's cute, furry litter-picking creatures that rose to fame on the BBC in the 1970s will return on Channel 5 in 2015. Bob the Builder - Everyone's favourite handyman, which screened in the late 1990s, is being developed by Hit Entertainment and will be back in 2015. SuperTed featured the adventures of a discarded teddy bear who is turned . into a superhero with a dashing of cosmic dust and Mother Nature’s . secret magic wand. He was joined by alien friends Spotty and Blotch, who together fight villains Texas Pete, Skeleton and Bulk. BBC producers hope original voice actors Derek Griffiths, who narrated SuperTed himself, and Melvyn Hayes, who narrated Skeleton, and will return. Roy Kinnear, who voiced the villain Bulk, died in 1988. However Mr Young, who broke news of the remake in the Radio Times, has warned viewers to expect some changes to make the series more appropriate for a contemporary audience. He said: ‘Popeye used to smash people in the face. It was very funny, but no television network would let you do that now. ‘In SuperTed, we had a gun-slinging cowboy, a gay skeleton and a fat guy who had jokes made about his weight – things you wouldn’t do today. But you can still write it in a funny way.’ The Welsh cartoon is one of several classic children's programmes being brought back, which include favourites like the Teletubbies and Dangermouse.

"Al-Shabaab has released a graphic video calling for 'Westgate-style' attacks on shopping centers including the Mall of America  - prompting officials to drastically tighten security at the iconic site. In the video, apparently released by the Somalia-based terror group's media wing, a masked militant also encourages radicalized Muslims to assault malls in Canada and  Oxford Street in London. Donning a camouflage jacket with a headscarf covering his face, the fighter threatens action and refers to the  group's 2013 siege on Kenya's Westgate Mall, in which more than 60 people died. The Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, is specifically targeted.

Chilling: A new video, apparently released by Al-Shabaab, calls for 'Westgate-style' attacks on shopping centers including the Mall of America - prompting officials to drastically increase security at the iconic site. In the footage, a masked militant speaks beside a shot of the iconic mall and its GPS co-ordinates (pictured) Targeted: The Mall of America (pictured)  in Bloomington, Minnesota, is America's largest shopping center. It boasts 40million visitors a year and contributes nearly $2billion in annual economic activity to Minnesota . Previous siege; Donning a camouflage jacket with a headscarf covering his face, the fighter threatens action and refers to the group's 2013 siege on Kenya's Westgate Mall (pictured), in which more than 60 people died . Speaking directly to the camera, the unnamed militant says: 'If just a handful of mujahideen fighters could bring Kenya to a complete stand-still for nearly a week, just imagine what the dedicated mujahideen could do in the West to American or Jewish shopping centers across the world.' He adds: 'What if such an attack were to occur in the Mall of America in Minnesota? Or the West Edmonton Mall in Canada? Or in London's Oxford Street?'. Now, the Mall of America is taking 'extra security precautions' in light of the threat. Officials are reportedly working closely with the FBI and America's Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Some of the new security measures will be visible to shoppers, while others will not, a security official told CBS News, adding that employees 'will remain diligent as they would do in any similar situation.' Speaking to Fox News, Jim Kallstrom, the former assistant director of the FBI’s New York office, said the bureau has a 'huge job' in front of them in the wake of the threatening online video.

Crowded: 'I would say that if anyone is planning to go to the Mall of America today, they've got to be particularly careful,' Mr Johnson said  on CNN's 'State of the Union.' Above, the busy interior of the mall . 'You look at the Mall of America, you look at all the malls, then you start to backtrack and say it would be nice if we knew what comes and goes into the country,' he said. 'We don’t have a clue.' On Sunday, US homeland security chief Jeh Johnson urged shoppers to be on their guard while visiting the Mall of America - the country's largest shopping center, with 40million visitors a year. 'I would say that if anyone is planning to go to the Mall of America today, they've got to be particularly careful,' Mr Johnson said during an appearance on CNN's 'State of the Union.' 'This latest statement from al-Shebaab reflects the new phase we've evolved to in the global terrorist threat in that you have groups such as al-Shebaab, ISIL [ie. the Islamic State, or ISIS], publicly calling for independent actors in their home lands to carry out attacks. 'We're beyond the phase now where these groups would send foreign operatives into countries after being trained someplace.' He added that he was 'very concerned' about the potential threat 'lone wolf terrorists' pose to shopping centers across the US. 'Any time they call for an attack against a specific place, we've got to take that seriously,' he said. Another DHS official later clarified that Mr Johnson's did not mean shoppers should avoid  the Mall of America - only that they should be 'extra vigilant' and should be aware that security is increased. Shortly after the Westgate Mall incident in September 2013, al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack and estimated 67 deaths. Around 200 people were also injured in the days-long assault. In the newly-released video, al-Shabaab runs a documentary-style account of the deadly attack, complete with images of terrified men, women and children running for their lives through the mall.

Above, people escape the mall . The masked militant then appears on-screen and suggests similar attacks could be carried out on the Mall of America, the West Edmonton Mall in Canada, or London's popular Oxford Street. The footage, apparently posted online by the Islamic group, also includes six minutes of graphic images of terrorist activity and discusses Kenyan forces' intervention in Somalia, it is reported. Minnesota, where the Mall of America is based, is home to a sizeable Somali population. U.S. law officials have been concerned about the potential for radicalization among some of the community. Last week, a Minnesota man was charged with conspiring to support ISIS - which has taken over swathes of Iraq and Syria - and lying to federal agents investigating recruitment by militant groups. Prosecutors said dozens of people from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area - many, Somali-Americans - have traveled or attempted to travel overseas to support ISIS or al-Shabaab since 2007.

Popular: And he also encourages radicalized Muslims to target Oxford Street (pictured) in London, England . The Mall of America, which is privately run and attracts millions of people every month, contributes nearly $2 billion in annual economic activity to the state of Minnesota, according to its website. On Sunday, mall officials issued a statement about the threat made by al-Shabaab, saying they are monitoring events with the help of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. 'The Mall of America has implemented extra security precautions, some may be noticeable to guests, and others won't be,' the officials said. The West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada, draws an estimated 30.8 million visitors a year. according to its website.

"Struggling: The publishers of Penthouse are filing for bankruptcy after amassing $300million worth of debt . The publisher of adult magazine Penthouse has filed for bankruptcy with $300million of debt. The magazine has seen a sharp drop in sales as a result of the rise of free adult content on the internet and is now looking for investors to cover their losses. California-based FriendFinder Networks, who own the publication, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Tuesday after losing $49.4 million last year, and $10.3 million in the past quarter. But the company said it has reached an agreement with key stakeholders to keep the magazine on the shelves and return control to its founders. However, founded by Bob Guccione, whose monthly circulation is now said to be 175,000 down from 5 million at its peak, may be snapped up by New Jersey-born entrepreneur Jeremy Frommer. Last year, Mr Frommer acquired a trove of memorabilia owned by the late Guc­cione that included nude photos of Madonna and a picture of former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger engaged in a sex act. He is now the CEO of the Guccione Collection. Today, Mr Frommer told MailOnline: 'I would  like to see the Penthouse brand restored to its former glory and carry on the legacy of Bob Guccione.' However, he would not comment on ongoing discussions. Chief . executive Anthony Previte, said: 'The Chapter 11 filing is the most . efficient and cost-effective way for the company to implement the . transaction support agreement while continuing to operate our business.' 'All . operations will continue as normal throughout this process. Importantly, nothing about the user experience is going to change and we . anticipate that all of our affiliates will continue to be paid in the . ordinary course of business during the Chapter 11 process.' Penthouse was founded in 1965 as a rival to Hugh Hefner's Playboy. Bob Guccione began publishing the magazine in Britain in 1965 and four years later in the United States, . earning him a fortune of around $400 million by the 1980's. However, the rise in popularity of the internet badly affected sales and several bad business deals put publishers General Media in financial trouble. Drop in sales: The magazine has struggled to compete with the availability of free adult content on the internet. Its founder Bob Guccione (right) died in 2010 after the company was taken over by FriendFinder Networks . History: Founder of Penthouse Magazine, Bob Guccione, when the magazine started in 1965 . In 2003 the company declared itself . bankrupt after defaulting on its loans, but restarted the following year and . was renamed Penthouse Media Group.

"Fresh charges were laid against 22-year-old Agim Kruezi on Friday, including that he transported a gun and stockpiled machetes, knives and balaclavas in preparation for a terrorist act . A young Queensland man charged with supporting terrorists in Syria was also planning a terrorist attack on Australian soil, it will be alleged. Fresh charges were laid against 22-year-old Agim Kruezi on Friday, including that he transported a gun and stockpiled machetes, knives and balaclavas in preparation for a terrorist act. It's understood a case will be made that Kruezi was planning a home-soil attack in Australia, but no other details, including an intended target, are known. Kruezi is now facing a total of seven charges, including the new ones that accuse him of transporting a firearm in preparation for a terrorist act, and possessing equipment - including machetes, knives, balaclavas, military fatigues and a firearm - in preparation for a terrorist act. The older charges, laid after his arrest in September, allege he was preparing for incursions into war-torn Syria, and recruiting people to join that fight. The case against Kruezi was mentioned in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday, along with charges against two other terror suspects, Omar Succarieh, 31, and Louis Maestracci, 32, who were also arrested earlier this year. All three matters were adjourned until December 19 after crown prosecutor Shane Hunter requested the lengthy delay to allow Australian Federal Police enough time to prepare evidence briefs. Kruezi is now facing a total of seven charges,. These include the new ones and the older charges, laid after his arrest in September, allege he was preparing for incursions into war-torn Syria, and recruiting people to join that fight . Kruezi, along with two others, were arrested in September in counter-terrorism raids . 'Their commitment to the event (G20) that's going to occur in Brisbane in November is significant and that will hamper the timeframe to which the briefs can be prepared,' Mr Hunter told the court. Succarieh's lawyer James Wallace urged Magistrate John McGrath to have his client's matter brought forward given the amount of time he had already spent in custody. 'It is unfortunate that the upcoming G20 summit is going to be used as a reason to delay proceedings,' Mr Wallace said. 'In circumstances where Mr Succarieh is in custody for the very first time away from his wife and children, where he is subject to orders that mean he is currently in solitary confinement.' However, Mr McGrath said because the three matters were related, they should all be heard on the same day. None of the men are required in court on the next appearance on December 19. Kruezi and Succarieh were arrested in September in counter-terrorism raids in the Brisbane and Logan areas. Like Kruezi, Succarieh is also accused of preparing for incursions into Syria. But he's also facing a charge of providing funds to the terrorist organisation Jabhat al-Nusra in Syria. Maestracci was arrested following counter-terrorism raids at his home in Kingston, South of Brisbane, in September. He's accused of dealing with money that could have been used to fund terrorist operatives overseas. He's currently on bail.

"A group of scientists in China have invented the world's first lightbulb that emits its own wifi signal. Researchers at Fudan University in Shanghai, have developed a prototype for the new technology, which they have aptly named Li-Fi. Experts claim the micro-chipped LED bulb works even better than the average wireless internet connection in China. Scientists in Shanghai have developed a wifi-emitting LED lightbulb that can connect as many as four computers to the internet at once . As many as four devices near the lightbulb can connect to its signal using light frequencies rather than radio waves, according to Gizmodo. The bulb itself is embedded with a microchip that produces its signal, which at 150 megabites per second, is considerably faster than the average wifi connection in the country. Next month researchers will unveil 10 sample lightbulbs and their accompanying kits at the International Industry Fair in Shanghai next month. Experts suggest that this faster, cheaper and more energy efficient way of connecting to the internet could become common practice in Chinese homes, where more and more people are abandoning traditional lightbulbs in favour of LEDs. Li-Fi reportedly only uses five per cent . of the energy required to power other wifi-emitting devices which rely . on cooling systems to supply internet to cell towers and stations. Though the new technology is well suited to the country's changing technological trends, developers have encountered problems in its design and manufacturing, with particular difficulty being found in the design of the microchip. Moreover, the connection is lost if the light is turned off or if its bulb becomes blocked, according to technology experts Dvice.","Researchers in Shanghai have developed the technology called Li-Fi .

"Rolls Royce has revealed dramatic plans to replace cargo ships with crewless 'drone boats' controlled remotely. The firm is developing a 'virtual deck' in Norway that would allow captains to remotely command ships anywhere in the world. Drone ships would be safer, cheaper and less polluting for the $375 billion shipping industry that carries 90 percent of world trade, Rolls-Royce says. A fleet of drone ships: Drone ships would be safer, cheaper and less polluting for the $375 billion shipping industry that carries 90 percent of world trade, Rolls-Royce says. Cameras would beam 360-degree views from the drone ship back to operators based in a virtual bridge. Rolls Royce is already testing a VR system in Norway for navigating the vessel remotely to steer them to their destinations. The firm eventually hopes it would be able to remove all crew from the ship. Rolls-Royce has already begun the process of designing giant drone ships able to shuttle cargo across the ocean minus a single solitary human being on board. The UK engineering group's Blue Ocean marine innovation department have announced the concept of the robot vessels they believe would be able to carry more cargo, cut costs, be safer and produce less pollution. Cameras would beam 360-degree views from the drone ship back to operators based in a virtual bridge VR system in Norway navigating the vessel remotely to steer them to their destinations. Talks have commenced over any regulatory obstacles and potential perceived hurdles and Rolls Royce are optimistic that the drone ships may be operational in ten years time. A Rolls-Royce Spokesperson says: 'Some steps have already been taken, mainly in the naval area, but we believe a first step will be moving certain functions on a ship ashore. 'For example, remote engine and equipment monitoring and some underwater operations - such as controlling ROVs - in the offshore sector could be the first.' Cameras would beam 360-degree views from the drone ship back to operators based in a virtual bridge VR system in Norway navigating the vessel remotely to steer them to their destinations. The firm has already begun outfitting ships with advanced cameras. 'A growing number of vessels are already equipped with cameras that can see at night and through fog and snow - better than the human eye, and more ships are fitted with systems to transmit large volumes of data. 'So, some questions: given that the technology is in place, is now the time to move some operations ashore? Is it better to have a crew of 20 sailing in a gale in the North Sea, or say five people in a control room on shore? 'The same person could monitor and steer many ships.' The crewless ships would also be cheaper to build an maintain, Rolls Royce says. Project Blueshark, where the US Navy is trialling virtual reality headsets. Here, a soldier is seen operating a virtual ship - with commands that could one day remotely control a real warship. now Rolls Royce has revealed similar plans for cargo ships. 'Many facilities and systems on board are only there to ensure that the crew is kept fed, safe, and comfortable.

Webber urged anyone that may have seen him to contact police. 'If you think you saw a 6'5"", 250lb man, there aren't many out there. Chances are, it's him,' he said. His appeal came as a group of former Ohio State players tweeted their offer of a $1,000 cash reward for information that leads to Karageorge, who also goes by his middle name Alex. Ohio State University's football stadium went silent Saturday as an announcer called out his name and the missing poster appeared on the scoreboard. The senior was reported missing after he uncharacteristically skipped two practices. His mother, Susan Karageorge, told police he has had several concussions and a few spells of being extremely confused. The team's physician insists the squad would not have let Karageorge play after injury or illness if he weren't ready.

"Actress Uma Thurman's yoga-teacher brother has been accused of using his classes at a hip New York yoga school to woo students into bed with him. The claim was made by Columbia media law adjunct professor Maria Sliwa, who posted on yoga forum Yoganonymous about Dechen Thurman, 41. Sliwa, a former NYPD officer, journalist, and younger sister of Guardian Angels founder, activist and radio host Curtis Sliwa, branded Thurman a 'sex addict' for his alleged sexcapades with students at Jivamukti in lower Manhattan. 'Sex addict': Maria Sliwa has accused Dechen Thurman of sleeping with his students at Jivamukti yoga studio in Manhattan . MailOnline's attempts to reach Dechen Thurman through Jivamukti were not successful. The studio's front desk person also declined to comment on the allegations, saying the subject made her 'feel uncomfortable' before hanging up. Sliwa wrote that as a friend and former legal adviser to Thurman, she was privy to information that she could not in good conscience keep to herself. Confidant: Maria Sliwa says she felt obligated to go public with her accusations for the safety of both Thurman and his students . 'Plenty of women there [at Jivamukti] express plenty of feelings, and sometimes I do reciprocate as is my right as an individual to do so. Sometimes there are as many as five or six women in the class who I have slept with,' Dechen Thurman allegedly told Sliwa in a private message. Sliwa said that she witnessed Thurman's bouts of crying, violent mood swings, threats of suicide and confessions of sex addiction before she felt obligated to report his behavior to Juivamukti management in a 41-page exposé. The yoga studio's code of conduct clearly states that sexual relationships between teachers and students are unacceptable. 'All forms of sexual behavior or . harassment with students are unethical, even when a student invites or . consents to such behavior involvement,' reads the Jivamukti Code of . Professional Standards. Sliwa . writes that she was forced to go public with her claims after repeated . assurances by the Jivamukti management that they would seek help for . Thurman went unfulfilled. 'When . I met with Jivamukti, I submitted volumes of evidence. I also offered . to take a polygraph exam, and was told that it was not necessary and . that the school believed everything I had submitted as true,' she wrote . in a Facebook post addressing the Yoganonymous post. 'When . the school promised me many things, but did not follow through, I had . no other recourse than to take this to a public forum. I do not believe . that his present situation at Jivamukti is safe for himself as well as . for others.' The other Thurman sibling: Dechen Thurman with his sister Uma . Yoga lover: Thurman allegedly told Sliwa that he would often have classes in which five or six of the students were women he has slept with . A spokesman for Jivamukti told Yoganonymous staff are investigating Sliwa's claims. 'These are very serious allegations which the school takes very seriously and can lead to the teacher [sic] termination.…Please reassure [sic] that we will handle it with the outmost care and seriousness,' Carlos Menjivarthe Managing Director of the Jivamukti Yoga School said. Jivamukti was co-founded by Sharon Gannon and David Life and has a slew of high profile supporters including Madonna, Donna Karan, Sting, Sarah Jessica Parker and Christy Turlington. Code of conduct: The Jivamukti Yoga School's code, which Thurman signed, states that 'All forms of sexual behavior or harassment with students are unethical' Emotional issues: Sliwa alleges that Thurman had violent mood swings, fits of crying and had threatened to commit suicide . 'I was a close friend of Dechen and he told me he suffers from sex addiction. He is a good teacher but he has problems with women and his technique is unfortunately very hands-on. It is unsafe for the students. He needs therapy,' Sliwa told Page Six, calling him a 'yoga gigolo.' 'Yoga class is not a pick-up place for predators.' In a feat of timing, his sister actress Uma Thurman's latest film, Lars Von Trier's Nymphomaniac, is set for release in March. Following publication of this article, the original accusation was removed from Yoganonymous.","Dechen Thurman, 41, is accused of using his yoga classes to 'pick-up' students in his Jivamukti yoga classes .

"A mysterious 'beam' of static electricity has been caught on camera making a passer-by's hair stand on end. In the clip, filmed outside Google's headquarters in London, Simon Legrand is shown entering the field of electricity before his hair rises - silhouetted by a nearby street lamp. As the camera then pans towards the building, a large crack of static electricity is heard before the video cuts out. Scroll down for video . In the clip, filmed outside Google's headquarters in St Giles High Steet London, Simon Legrand is shown entering the field of electricity (pictured left) before his hair begins to stand on end (pictured right) - silhouetted by a nearby street lamp . The footage was filmed on Friday night. Mr Legrand and his friend, known only as Nick, were walking past the tech giant’s office in St Giles High Street, when they said they felt a ‘strong electric field’ and decided to film the experience. In the clip, Mr Legrand passes his phone to Nick before saying: ‘Alright, so there’s this static electricity beam, right next to the Google building in London. ‘I’m going to go inside the beam, and my hair is going to go up.’ At which point he explains that he can feel the electricity on his forehead, and describes it as ‘super strong, like a beam of static electricity.’ Although the shot is dark, Mr Legrand’s hair can be seen rising in front of a nearby street light. The strange field was first discovered by a Reddit user earlier this year. This led to theories that there was a problem with wiring beneath the building (pictured), or that electricity was being generated by the building's metal poles rubbing together. MailOnline has contacted Google for a comment . Static electricity occurs when there is an imbalance between the positive and negative charges in an object. These charges can build up on the surface of an object, until they find a way to be released or discharged. When certain materials rub against each other, it can transfer electrons and create this charge - although it is not known what caused the electrical build-up to occur around the Google building. MailOnline has contacted Google for a comment. As the camera pans towards the building, a crackle of static electricity is heard and Nick shouts: ‘Oh my god, can you hear that?’, before the video cuts out. ‘Initially it didn't hurts us, just surprised us,’ Mr Legrand wrote online. ‘Then it seemed to intensify and my phone started crackling and the video cut.

"The warmer weather is said to have caused thousands of spiders to flood homes, but if you’re concerned about the invasion, spare a thought for the owners of a waste treatment plant in the US. The Baltimore property was so riddled with arachnids that webbing covered approximately 95 per cent of the entire building. This was the equivalent to four acres - or three American football fields - and was said to house more than 107 million of the eight-legged critters. The web was discovered at the Baltimore Wastewater Treatment Plant in 2009 (pictured) and experts predicted there were approximately 35,176 spiders per cubic metre of space . Experts estimated there were around 35,176 spiders per cubic square metre of space. Each spider measured around half an inch, including legs. These spiders included a species known as a Long-jawed orb weaver, or Tetragnathidae, typically found in damp or swamp habitats. They have long slim bodies with shiny abdomens. Last month, researchers in Guyana discovered a puppy-sized spider living in the rainforest. Known as the South American Goliath birdeater, the spider was spotted by entomologist and photographer Piotr Naskrecki from Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology. He wrote on his blog that the arachnid is officially the world’s largest spider, according to the Guinness World Record book, and it’s leg can grow to a foot (30cm). It can also weigh up 6 ounces (170g), which the photographer compared to the same weight as a newborn puppy. Orb webs produced by the Araneidae species, of which the Tetragnathidae is a member, are used for catching prey. Other webs are used either for reproduction, or to help spiders find their way back to a specific location. The giant web was originally reported by the owners of the Baltimore Wastewater Treatment Plant to pest controllers in 2009, and the photos were released as part of a Halloween feature on Wired. The were taken from Albert Greene’s paper, ‘An Immense Concentration of Orb-Weaving Spiders With Communal Webbing in a Man-Made Structural Habitat’. According to the researchers, the webbing was so heavy it even damaged light fixtures and clumps of web were, in some places, as ‘thick as a fire hose.’ The same year that the Baltimore web was removed, scientists in Madagascar discovered one of the strongest webs ever created. Darwin’s bark spider produces webs that typically stretch more than 50ft (15 metres) wide, made of dragline silk. The property was so riddled with arachnids that webbing (pictured) covered approximately 95 per cent of the entire building. This was the equivalent to four acres - or three American football fields - and was said to contain more than 107 million spiders .

The bizarre 'defence mechanism' was filmed when Mathew Duncan, of Chula Vista, California, when he captured two adult spiders in a jar. Dr Judith Lock, an expert in behavioural ecology at the University of Southampton, told MailOnline at the time that the spiderlings jumped off their mother's backs when she was under threat. A few species of spiders allow their offspring to ride on their backs while they are small.

"A 12-year-old Christian girl was kidnapped and repeatedly raped for eight months in Pakistan by a man who then falsified marriage documents with her, it was claimed today. The girl was lured on a shopping trip in Lahore by a friend, before she was driven 120 miles to Tandianwalla and raped by the friend's uncle in January this year. Two days later, she was forced to sign papers consenting to marriage with the man and beaten for refusing to convert from Christianity to Islam. Attack: A 12-year-old Christian girl was kidnapped, beaten until she converted to Islam and repeatedly raped for eight months in Lahore, Pakistan (pictured), according to a human rights organisation . She was then held against her will for eight months, before managing to escape and contact her family. The Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) has said the rapists have not been arrested because of their affiliation with a militant Muslim organisation - the Lashkar-e-Tayyaba. It claims the police have refused to order a medical check-up on the girl, and have warned her parents that it would be better for them to hand over the girl to her 'legal' husband or a criminal case would be filed against them. An investigation into the kidnapping found the girl's father reported her disappearance in January and made complaints against her abductors, but police took no action for eight months. Last month, the girl - who has not been named for legal reasons - called her family from Tandianwalla and told them she had been abducted, but had escaped and was hiding at a bus stop. Militant ties: The Asian Human Rights Commission claims Pakistani police have refused to investigate the kidnapping because the perpetrators are tied to an extremist group (file picture) The girl's parents travelled to the town and rescued her, before taking her to a local magistrate to give a statement. The rapists then contacted the police through their religious group and produced a marriage certificate that claimed to show one of them was married to the 12-year-old. As a result of their complaint, the Christian family has gone into hiding as members of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba are searching for them.

"Political duo, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton teamed up on stage at the White House yesterday. The smartly-dressed mother-daughter hosted a ticketed forum on illegal wildlife trafficking, calling for a return to the stricter anti-poaching rules of the Nineties. Later in the day, former secretary of state, Hillary also took the opportunity to endorse President Obama's call for military strikes against Syria. Team Clinton: Chelsea joined her mother Hillary at the White House last night to engage support for their newly renamed family foundation . According to the Washington Post she said 'it would be an important step' if Syrian President Bashar al-Assad surrendered his stockpile of chemical weapons. 'The Assad regime’s inhuman use of weapons of mass destruction against innocent men, women and children violates a universal norm at the heart of our global order, and therefore it demands a strong response from the international community, led by the United States,' she continued. As a U.S. senator in 2002, Hillary Clinton endorsed military action in Iraq, a decision that came back to haunt her in her failed White House campaign six years later. Subject close to their hearts: The smartly-dressed, mother-daughter duo hosted a ticketed forum on illegal wildlife trafficking, smiling as they left the stage . Well done: During her speech, Chelsea called for a return to stricter anti-poaching rules . Now, the 65-year-old potential 2016 presidential candidate is risking the possibility of a similar political situation in a future campaign with her support of President Obama's call for a U.S.-led military strike in Syria as punishment for the use of chemical weapons. The two conflicts are different: Iraq was a full-fledged war with ground troops that lasted nearly nine years, while the Obama administration is talking about a limited, focused air attack in Syria. Even so, opponents could use Clinton's position against her in a future campaign. 'The world will have to deal with this threat as swiftly and comprehensively as possible,' Clinton said Monday in her first public endorsement of Obama's plan to respond to Syria's chemical weapons use. Making her mark: Chelsea, 33, acts as vice president for her family's non-profit foundation, recently renamed to include all three Clintons in the name . Special bond: Chelsea is the only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former secretary of state, Hillary . Lost in thought: Later in the day Hillary Clinton took the opportunity to endorse President Obama's call for military strikes against Syria . She welcomed suggestions that the Assad regime may surrender its stockpile of chemical weapons, but echoed warnings from the Obama administration that 'this cannot be another excuse for delay and obstruction.' She's expected to repeat her stance in a speech Tuesday, despite widespread American and congressional opposition to military intervention. An Associated Press poll released Monday found that most Americans oppose even a limited attack - likely with cruise missiles - and about half are fearful that a strike would lead to a long-term U.S. military commitment in Syria. As she did with the Iraq vote nearly a dozen years ago, Clinton is betting she will be on the right side of history by standing with Obama despite the public opinion polls and a divided Congress. Political crowd: Sally Jewell, secretary of the interior, sits next to Chelsea in the audience . It was similar to the gamble she made in 2002 when she voted to give President George W. Bush the authorization to use force in Iraq. The resolution passed the Senate, and public opinion was more supportive of war. By the time the 2008 presidential primary campaign came around, support for the war had soured. Obama, who had spoken out in opposition to the war as an Illinois state senator, won the Democratic nomination over Clinton in part by playing up the differences in their positions on the Iraq war. Clinton's supporters say this time is different, and they argue that she will be rewarded politically for sticking by the president. Clinton's support was not exactly a surprise. As the nation's top diplomat, she supported intervening in Syria with a proposal in the summer of 2012 to arm vetted units of the Syrian rebels. Pricey affair: Apparently after giving their speeches on Monday evening the Clintons held a cocktail reception at the Italian Embassy, with tickets costing $1,000 a person . The White House later turned down those plans. Clinton also pushed attempts in the United Nations to develop a political transition in Syria and provide humanitarian aid to Syrians. The Clinton Foundation, set up after the 42nd president left the White House, was renamed a few weeks ago to include all three Clintons in the name. Chelsea Clinton, 33, has become vastly more engaged in running operations over recent years, taking on the role as vice chair. The New York Times reported this summer that the family are now trying to raise a $250million endowment . According to the Washington Post after giving their speeches on Monday evening the Clintons held a cocktail reception at the Italian Embassy, with tickets costing $1,000 a person. Later they hosted a dinner at their home on Whitehaven Street for $25,00 per couple.","The mother-daughter duo hosted a ticketed forum on illegal wildlife trafficking .

"Ever since scientists have theorised that dark matter exists, concrete evidence of the elusive substance has continued to confound them. Now, data from a number of GPS satellites suggest that a halo of the strange matter may be surrounding Earth, causing our planet to be heavier than first believed. From his calculations, Professor Ben Harris from Texas University claims this halo could affect the Earth's gravity and that the planet could be 0.005 and 0.008 per cent heavier than . the mass established by the International Astronomical Union. A number of GPS satellites have revealed that a halo of dark matter may be surrounding Earth, causing our planet to be heavier than first believed. Dark matter is considered crucial to theories explaining how the universe is expanding and how galaxies interact . This would be the equivalent of a disc of dark matter around the equator . which is 191km (120 miles) thick and 70,000 km (43,000 miles) across.

Dark matter is considered crucial to theories explaining how the universe is expanding and how galaxies interact. It is thought to make up 27 per cent of the universe, but despite huge amounts of funding and research effort, experiments have so far failed to confirm its presence. In 2009, researchers at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Princeton, argued that changes in the speeds of space probes as they flew past the Earth could be explained by dark matter bound by Earth's gravity. Using data on the satellites in the U.S. GPS, Russian GLONASS and European Galileo groups, Professor Harris measured Earth's mass as 'felt' by each satellite. From his calculations, Professor Harris claims the Earth is between 0.005 and 0.008 per cent heavier than the mass established by the International Astronomical Union . Dark matter accounts for around 27 per cent of the universe. It surrounds galaxies across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light. It . cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be . out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we . can see. Galaxies, . for example, could not rotate the way they do and hold their shape . without the presence of dark matter, researchers say. The European Space Agency said: 'Shine a torch in a completely dark room, and you will see only what the torch illuminates. 'That does not mean that the room around you does not exist. 'Similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly.' Scientists are fairly sure it exists and . is crucial to the universe, but they do not know what it looks like or . where to find it. The theory has now been put to the . test by Professor Ben Harris at the University of Texas, according to a . report by Anil Ananthaswamy in New Scientist. Using . data on the satellites in the U.S. GPS, Russian GLONASS and European . Galileo groups, Professor Harris measured Earth's mass as ‘felt’ by each . satellite. As satellites orbit the Earth, their location in space is determined by the Earth's gravitational pull. By . using the data and location of these satellites, Professor Harris was able to . estimate how strong this pull was, which in turn gave an indication to . how heavy the Earth is. ‘The nice thing about GPS satellites is that we know their orbits really, really well,’ he told New Scientist. Professor Harris is now planning to factor in changes to the satellites' orbits due to the gravitational pull of the sun and moon. If his calculations prove to be correct, satellites could help unlock some longstanding mysterious surrounding dark matter. Scientists still have no concrete proof that dark matter exists, but the evidence for it is significant. Galaxies, . for example, could not rotate the way they do and hold their shape . without the presence of dark matter, researchers say. The quest to find it is now gaining pace. Last year one of the biggest quests in physics, the search for the enigmatic substance known as dark matter, failed to provide answers. The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment, the world’s most advanced test to find this elusive material, was unable to detect its presence after its first 90-day run. A number of researchers are currently re-examining dark matter candidates once written off as unlikely, and considering unpopular ideas such as dark matter could be made out of something undetectable.

"Plans to hand MPs an inflation-busting 11 per cent pay rise sparked a civil war in Westminster last night, with ministers and backbenchers at loggerheads over whether to pocket the cash. The Cabinet, Labour frontbenchers and Lib Dem ministers are all set to reject plans by an independent watchdog to raise their basic salary from £66,396 to £74,000 – nearly three times the average wage – from 2015. Senior figures in all three parties branded the proposals ‘preposterous’, ‘unthinkable’ and ‘wholly inappropriate’ at a time of public sector  pay freezes. Many are expected to hand the extra cash to charity. Tension: David Cameron is among a group opposing Ipsa's suggestion to increase MPs salaries to almost triple the average wage. But Jack Straw (right) says it is needed to encourage people from modest backgrounds . But backbench MPs reacted with anger at the calls for restraint, arguing that they deserve pay rises. And Tory MPs privately said they would frown on calls for restraint from ‘millionaires in the Cabinet’ who have their own private wealth to fall back on. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which was charged with setting MPs’ pay after the expenses scandal, will announce the pay rise on Thursday. MPs can no longer vote to block it. In return for the extra cash, MPs will have to make higher pension contributions, bringing them in line with the rest of the public sector. They will see their expenses claims for dinner, taxis and tea and biscuits slashed. And in future, MPs who walk away from Parliament will be denied lucrative golden goodbye payments, which will be claimed only by those who are defeated at the polls. During Ipsa’s consultation process over the summer, 69 per cent of MPs, questioned anonymously, said they deserved a pay rise. On average, they judged they were worth £86,000 a year. One in five wanted more than £95,000. Against: Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander told Andrew Marr he will not take the money . Also unhappy: Labour leader Ed Miliband and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg have also blasted the figure . David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband all told Ipsa to change its plans. But it has ignored the complaints and said MPs need the extra money as they have fallen behind comparable jobs in the civil service and local government. Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show he would not take the money – a view echoed by aides to Mr Clegg and Business Secretary Vince Cable. Mr Alexander said: ‘I think it would be wholly inappropriate for MPs to get such a large pay rise at a time when every other public sector worker sees their pay rises capped at 1 per cent.’ Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: ‘This is not the moment’ for a big pay rise.’ David Cameron is expected to say on Thursday that the Cabinet will hand the pay rise to charities and other good causes. Labour sources said the shadow cabinet is likely to give away the extra money. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Ipsa appeared to have come to its conclusions ‘entirely out of any context of the real world’. Several MPs including shadow health . secretary Andy Burnham and Lib Dem pensions minister  Steve Webb said . they would forego the pay rise. The clash has divided parliament as some MPs claim they wont take it and others say they need it . But a handful publicly defended the move. Former Labour Home Secretary Jack Straw warned that failing to pay MPs more would damage the diversity of the Commons. ‘You will go on recruiting people of some talent who have family money or who have got many fewer family responsibilities but you won’t get, importantly, recruitment from people of modest backgrounds.’ Tory MP David Ruffley said: ‘It is an inconvenient truth that MPs’ pay has fallen behind other equivalent occupations for some years, such as the judiciary.’ But there was also anger that Cabinet ministers like Mr Hammond, who earns £134,000 a year and made millions from business, are expected to call on MPs not to take their pay rise. One Tory MP said: ‘It’s easy for ministers to tell the rest of us not to take the money when some of them are paid more than twice what backbenchers get.’ Sources close to Ipsa said the package would be cost-neutral, with pensions cuts paying for the higher salary. But short of passing a law to abolish Ipsa, it won’t be possible to hand back the money. One insider stressed: ‘They’ll get the money. What they choose to do with it is a matter for them.’","Cabinet, and leading figures in Labour and Lib Dems set to oppose rise .

"Richard Money will warn his Cambridge players that any shirts swapped with Manchester United's megastars after Friday's FA Cup tie must be replaced at their own cost – and anyone trading them at half-time will be shirtless for the rest of the game. A shirt-swap souvenir with Wayne Rooney or Robin van Persie will cost them the price of a new shirt, priced at £39.99 at the club shop - unless they can persuade chairman Dave Doggett to dip into the £250,000 the League Two club will earn from the game. Cambridge boss Richard Money has issued warning to his players over shirt swapping . 'We're not wealthy enough to give any of our shirts away,' said Cambridge boss Money. 'If they give their shirt away they're going to have to replace it. Maybe the club will do it, I don't know, but I'm not going to do it. 'It would appear that in the Premier League they give their shirt away after every game – sometimes at half-time. I don't understand why a top class player would want another top class player's shirt at half-time. 'If one of our players was trying to swap a shirt at half-time you could understand it, but they won't as they wouldn't have anything to wear in the second half.' League Two club will be seeking to cause a massive upset in the FA Cup on Friday night . It is a classic clash of the haves and have-nots in the FA Cup fourth round at the R Costings Abbey Stadium on Friday night. Cambridge runs largely with the help of volunteers and handful of full-time operational staff and their total annual wage bill for a year is just over £1million, roughly what players like the top players Rooney will earn in a month at Manchester United. 'We were determined not to increase the ticket prices,' said chief executive Jez George. 'We've charged £10 for a kid to watch on the terraces. You think it is quick win to make a lot of money on the night but in the longer term it does more harm than good. United stars like Robin van Persie earn in a month the equivalent of Cambridge's entire wage bill for a year . 'Once Man United go out of town we're back to League Two and valuing those supporters again, so we mustn't try to exploit the situation. We want to make sure we get the fans to come back. The game needs to be about more than what happens on the night. 'This club has lost money for the last 10 years and has survived due to the generosity of individuals, who have the club at heart like the chairman, Dave Doggett, some directors and Paul Barry, our major shareholder. 'They do it for a genuine love for the club. After a lot of years of finding it really tough maybe this tie is a bit of luck that the club's deserved.'","Cambridge players who swap shirts with Manchester United megastars will have to buy replacement from club shop .

"Britain could impose even stricter rules on migrant benefits after Germany launched a major crackdown on welfare tourism. Angela Merkel’s government is to deport any EU nationals lying to claim benefits and block the worst offenders from returning for up to five years. The announcement prompted calls for Britain to follow suit, and Downing Street said it was considering further changes to the rules in this country. Scroll down for video. David Cameron has been urged to copy moves by German Chancellor Angela Merkel to deport immigrants caught defrauding the welfare system . The proposed law has been dubbed ‘whoever lies, flies’. In addition to promising removal for benefit cheats, it includes prison sentences of up to three years for those convicted of making false statements about their residency status. Anyone wanting to stay in Germany for more than six months will be required to show they have a job or are likely to get one. And there will be a crackdown on those claiming to be self-employed to claim benefits. Downing Street said the German announcement could give fresh impetus to changes to the rules in Britain. Former welfare minster Frank Field said immigrants should be kicked out of the country if they break the law . Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘We have led the way with a series of measures to tackle abuses, tighten immigration routes and toughen up the rules on access to UK benefits – and we are now seeing Germany take similar action. ‘Freedom of movement is not a freedom to pick and choose where to claim benefits. ‘I believe there is a growing consensus in Europe on the need for change and we will continue to work with others to make that happen.’ From November, Mr Duncan Smith will reduce the amount of time EU migrants can claim out of work benefits to three months. They already have to wait three months before they can make a claim. EU nationals are not usually considered for deportation unless they are given a jail sentence of two years or more. They can in theory be removed if they are not exercising their rights by working or studying. The German government insists the measures comply with existing EU law. But the tougher approach will be a major boost to David Cameron as he seeks to push the EU towards tighter rules on welfare tourism. A No 10 spokesman welcomed Germany’s move, saying it showed that other EU countries share the UK’s concerns about benefit tourism. ‘They have come to the same conclusions as us about what is possible under the existing EU rules,’ he said. ‘Clearly there is now a case for looking at other things we want to do where we may need to change the rules.’ Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands are also understood to sympathise with the drive to curb the excesses of the EU’s free movement rules. Former welfare minister Frank Field urged the Government to follow Berlin’s lead. He said: ‘Anyone up in court and found guilty should be deported. Why should we put up with people who are breaking our laws?’ The German proposal, which is expected to become law next year, is a response to concerns over the influx of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants. Interior minister Thomas de Maiziere said: ‘We believe we can get control of this problem and yet at the same time maintain freedom of movement.’","Ministers in Germany are expected to announce new measures today .

"Pollution in Beijing is now so dense that its effects are comparable to that of a nuclear winter, Chinese scientists have said. It has been predicted that if enough nuclear bombs were detonated, so many particles would be thrown into the air that the sun could be blocked out enough to alter the weather and damage the food supply. This process is now under way in China’s capital city and six northern provinces, according to He Dongxian from China Agricultural University’s College of Water Resources and Civil Engineering. Scroll down for videos . Smog: Cars travel on an overpass amid thick haze in the morning in Beijing . Cars can barely be seen through the smog as they drive along a road in Beijing after a hazardous blanket enveloped the city . Polluted: The smog, pictured today in the Pingshan county of Shijiazhuang, in northern China's Hebei province, has become so severe that it could start to permanently alter the country's weather patterns . Health risk: Pedestrians wear protective masks as they cross a road amidst smog in Beijing . Danger: The smog, pictured today in the iconic Tiananmen Square in Beijing, can cause serious lung problems . She warned that the toxic smog is hindering photosynthesis of plants and that if it lingers much longer, it could affect food production, according to The Guardian. Dongxian demonstrated recently that seedlings in Beijing were taking over twice as long to grow as those in a lab. ‘Every farm is caught in a smog panic,’ she told The South China Morning Post. Pollution has been so severe that aircraft have been grounded, roads closed and tourists numbers hit, while the direct danger posed to human health was underlined by the World Health Organisation, whose readings in Beijing on Tuesday had alarming results. It was reported that the level of PM . 2.5 particles, a key measure of pollution because they are small enough . to be assimilated into the blood stream, reached 505 micrograms per . cubic metre, far higher than the maximum level it considers to be safe, . which is 25. Vehicles clog a highway in Beijing, with the buildings around them shrouded in toxic pollution . Buildings are seen shrouded in heavy haze at Qingdao development zone, Shandong province . China's naval chief has found a rather more positive side to the country's awful pollution. The smog, he says, provides an effective barrier against the emerging threat of laser weaponry. Rear Admiral Zhang Zhaozhong, a military expert at the National Defence University, spoke days after it was reported that the US Navy planned to deploy its first laser weapon aboard one of its ships in the Middle East. He said lasers were 'most afraid of smog' because it severely hampers the distance it can be fired. 'Under conditions where there is no smog, a laser weapon can fire (at a range of) 10 kilometres,' he told CCTV’s Haixia Liangan (Cross-Straits) current affairs program, according to www.news.com.au. 'When there’s smog, it’s only one kilometre. What's the point of making this kind of weapon?' Authorities have introduced anti-pollution policies and often pledged to clean up the environment but the problem has not eased. Beijing has been draped in stinking smog for more than a week and in an effort to cut pollution, 147 industrial companies in the capital had cut or suspended production as of Tuesday, according to Xinhua. City residents are growing angry and alarmed. ‘Of course, on days where pollution levels reach or even exceed the scale, we are very concerned and we have to see this as a crisis,’ Bernhard Schwartlander, the World Health Organization (WHO) representative in China, told Reuters. ‘There's now clear evidence that, in the long term, high levels of air pollution can actually also cause lung cancer,’ he said. Hebei, a major industrial region surrounding Beijing, has some of the most polluted cities in the world's most populous country. Shijiazhuang routinely recorded ‘beyond index’ measurements of polluting ‘particulate matter’ in early 2013. The China Academy of Sciences identified the province as a major source of noxious smog that hung over Beijing a year ago. The government said in an action plan . for Hebei in September that it would ban new projects in certain . industries, close outdated steel and cement facilities and slash coal . use. The . province has promised to cut total steel capacity by 86 million tonnes, . about 40 percent of last year's production, by 2020. Official data . suggests that is starting to happen.

"U.S. sheriffs are alarmed that securing the U.S. - Mexico border is no longer a concern for the law enforcement agencies near the boundary, with Mexico drug cartels infiltrating cities and towns across the country trading in human trafficking, prostitution, kidnapping and money laundering. Sam Page - sheriff of Rockingham County in North Carolina, who oversees 94,000 residents - told The Washington Times that a Mexican cartel set up a drug warehouse one mile from his home. He estimates hat cartels have infiltrated more than 3,000 U.S. cities and are recruiting local gangs, former prisoners and teenagers to join them. 'If we fail to secure our borders, then every sheriff in America will become a border sheriff,' he told The Times. The dangerous problems associated with the cartels¿drug and human trafficking, kidnapping, prostitution, violence, money laundering¿are now reaching places in the United States far beyond the Border States. Here officials patrol the border in Hidalgo, Texas . 'We're only a two-day drive from the border and have already seen the death and violence that illegal crossings brings into our community . 'These men are coming into our county with more firepower than I have. I'm literally outgunned.' Page was just one of many attending attending Hold Their Feet to the Fire, an annual two-day radio confab in Washington organized by the Federation for American Immigration Reform. Rusty Fleming, a spokesman for the Hudspeth County Sheriff's Office in Texas, is on the front lines of the border battle and said the U.S. is losing. 'These cartels are so sophisticated. They're getting affluent white teenagers to help them encrypt their software; they do digital money-laundering, can hack into government databases and actively recruit our agents to keep one step ahead. 'The rest of America is just now getting a taste of what we've been dealing with for years.' 'There's no doubt they're spreading themselves very rapidly and very deep into our U.S. interior.' Sheriff Page said Rockingham County has jailed 194 illegal immigrants on criminal charges since 2010. 'We're literally outgunned': U.S. sheriffs are worried that Mexican drug cartels now outgun law enforcement in terms of gun power . Of those arrested, 10 were released and later rearrested. Six were deported only to re-enter the country, re-establish themselves in his neighborhood and get rearrested. North Carolina has the second-busiest drug trafficking route in the South, after the region around Atlanta. 'We can't have open borders' Page said. 'We need to track who's coming in and out of our country. If we don't know who's here, how are we going to protect ourselves?' Law enforcement officers in Frederick County, Maryland, are also experiencing effects of cartels. 'It's a huge problem for our public safety and a growing problem in our jurisdiction,' Frederick County Sheriff Chuck Jenkins said. 'The federal government can't take care of this problem alone. Every state and law enforcement officer needs to be able to enforce immigration laws to be effective.' About 9 percent of Frederick County arrests involve illegal immigrants, according to the sheriff's office. Outmanned and outgunned, local law enforcement officers are alarmed by the drug and human trafficking, prostitution, kidnapping and money laundering that Mexican drug cartels are conducting in the U.S. far from the border . Since entering into an agreement with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement in early 2008, the Frederick County Sheriff's Office has detained 1,250 illegal immigrants, 50 of whom have had connections to Mexican drug cartels and organized crime, Sheriff Jenkins said. 'The success of the program is not in the numbers - it's who is actually getting arrested,' he said. 'Do I want Mexican gang members on the streets of Frederick County? Hell no.' He noted that the county recently deported  a convicted pedophile to Colombia who was in the U.S. illegally. 'This program works, but there's such a political fallout from using it, many county sheriffs won't,' Sheriff Jenkins said. He cited criticism from groups opposed to the federal mobilization of local law enforcement officers in immigration enforcement. Pablo Alvarado, executive director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said such programs waste federal money and are discriminatory. 'The idea of deputizing local sheriffs as front-line immigration reformers is a catastrophic mistake,' said Chris Newman, the network's general counsel. 'It distracts attention, chills people from reporting crime, encourages racial profiling and leads to the unconstitutional arrest and detainment of illegal immigrants.' Sheriff Page said that, on an everyday level and within the jurisdiction of sheriffs, tracking expired visas, using biometrics at points of entry along the border, and further empowering ICE and local law enforcement would help tremendously. The House Judiciary Committee is considering such measures in immigration reform bills.","Two-day radio confab organized by the Federation for .

"A popular police officer hailed as 'the face of the NYPD' has been found dead at her home in an apparent suicide. Stephanie Moses, 40, a police veteran of 17 years, is believed to have suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head at the home she shared with her girlfriend in Baldwin, Long Island. It is thought that she killed herself in the bedroom of her two-storey home after a fight with her lesbian lover Melissa McCoy, a retired NYPD detective. Moses had served in the NYPD's ceremonial unit and became a well-known face through her duties, most famously when photographed with President Obama at the 9/11 memorial in New York City last year.

Obama and Moses then bowed their heads together in a solemn dedication to victims of the 9/11 attacks. At the time, Obama said: 'When we say we will never forget, we mean what we say.' The ceremony was held just after the death of Osama Bin Laden to commemorate those who died at the World Trade Center in 2001. Numerous tributes to Stephanie Moses have flooded in following the first reports of the sergeant's death. NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said: 'On behalf of the New York City Police Department, I extend my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Sgt. Stephanie Moses who was, on so many occasions, the face of the NYPD on the national stage as well as routinely at police ceremonies.' Kelly added: 'She epitomized professionalism in her appearance, conduct and dedication to duty.

"Survivor: Nurbanu's husband threw acid in her face eight days after she divorced him for being unfaithful . This woman's horrific scars serve as a cruel and permanent reminder of the moment her husband of 18 years flung acid into her face. Nurbanu had divorced her unfaithful and violent spouse after catching him with another woman. Eight days later, she was cooking at home in Bangladesh when he pulled up on a motorbike and doused her with acid, leaving her blind and disfigured. The 36-year-old now has to endure living with her former spouse again after his mother forced her to sign an affidavit to have him released from prison following the attack. Nurbanu's husband of 18 years went . into hiding after mutilating his former wife, but was caught ten months later and . jailed for a year, according to a report on The Huffington Post. 'His mother paid for his release on bail,' said Nurbanu, who is from Satkhira in south west Bangladesh. 'She made me sign an affidavit to have him released. She used my sons to convince me to marry him again. 'People would think a husband would take care of a blind wife. But this doesn't happen,' Nurbanu said. She also said her spouse continues to beat and threaten her, adding: 'This is how my days go by.' Nurbanu, . who is unable to even prepare a meal for herself following her . husband's devastating attack, is one of thousands of women to fall . victim to acid violence in Bangladesh in recent years. Financial disputes, rejected marriage proposals and marital rows are common motives behind the attacks in the country. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Scroll down for video . Devastating: Nurbanu's daughter is seen cooking for her mother, who is no longer able to prepare a meal following the acid attack . Routine: Nurbanu has said her husband continues to be threatening and violent towards her . Monira Rahman, CEO of the Acid Survivors' Foundation (ASF) in Bangladesh, has worked with the victims of acid and petrol attacks in the country for the past 14 years. Experts have blamed women's low social status in Bangladesh for the frequency of the disturbing attacks. Although there are instances of men being targeted, the overwhelming majority of victims are female, and while the numbers of incidents are falling, the devastating attacks still occur relatively frequently in the country. The assailant throws nitric or sulphuric acid at the victim's face, body, and/or genitals, resulting in permanent disfigurement and scarring. A total of 59 attacks have already been recorded in the country this year, according to the Acid Survivors' Foundation. Of 118 survivors in 2011, 75 were female, and 13 of those were under the age of 18. Common motives behind the violent attacks include land or financial disputes, marital quarrels, and bitterness over spurned advances. In 2011 the Bangladeshi government announced new restrictions on the sale of acid in a bid to curb the number of attacks, and the number of recorded incidents fell from 500 in 2002 to 111 last year. But campaigners say more must be done to boost women's rights in Bangladesh in order to permanently rid the country of gender-based violence like acid attacks. In a blog for the Huffington Post, she said the majority of the girls and women she had worked with had suffered at the hands of men who viewed them as 'commodities', and 'believed they were justified in disfiguring them and violating their rights'. Ms Rahman said the number of acid attacks in Bangladesh has fallen thanks to the efforts of the government, the charity, donors and international development organisations to address the problem,  but added that there was much more work to do. There were 111 acid attacks in Bangladesh in 2011, compared to 500 in 2002. But Ms Rahman said 'gender-based' violence like acid attacks could only be completely eradicated when women in Bangladesh enjoy equal rights. 'Only by empowering women and ensuring equality we will have a society which has zero tolerance for violence against women,' she wrote. The Bangladesh-based ASF has teamed up with the charity Voluntary Services Overseas (VSO), which supports the foundation by training local medical professionals in treating burns, setting up counselling services, and by training women the organisation supports to produce garments that help reduce scarring, which they can then sell to help them earn a living. According to the ASF, the survivors of acid attacks have very little chance of finding work. Unmarried women who are victims of acid violence are also unlikely to marry in the future, it says. Along with the visible scars left by acid, attack victims endure psychological trauma and, in many cases, social isolation and ostracism.","Nurbanu had divorced her husband of 18 years after discovering he had been unfaithful .

"Brave Peter Siebold (pictured) spoke for the first time about the tragedy that killed his close friend, co-pilot Mike Alsbury, revealing that he gave a passing plane a thumbs up to show that he was alive . The pilot who miraculously survived the Virgin spaceship disaster has revealed how he was blasted from the wreckage of the disintegrating rocket ship and plummeted nearly ten miles back to Earth. Having suffered serious injuries, the experienced test pilot only regained consciousness halfway into his fall but was composed enough to give a thumbs-up to colleagues in a passing aircraft to show he was alive. Brave Peter Siebold spoke for the first time about the tragedy that killed his close friend, co-pilot Mike Alsbury, revealing he blacked out as the craft broke up around him at 50,000ft but was saved by his emergency parachute. Siebold, 43, a married father of two, said: ‘I must have lost consciousness at first. I can’t remember anything about what happened but I must have come to during the fall. I remember waving to the chase plane and giving them the thumbs-up to tell them I was OK. I know it’s a miracle I survived.’ The Mail on Sunday can reveal that despite his injuries, Siebold – who is yet to speak to crash investigators – returned home to his family on Monday, just three days after Sir Richard Branson’s SpaceShipTwo tore apart. He gave his amazing account of survival to his father, Dr Klaus Siebold, who visited him yesterday at his modest £150,000 ranch home in Tehachapi, California, on the edge of the Mojave Desert where the spaceship crashed. Dr Siebold, who is also a pilot, travelled to California from his home in Seattle to see his son. He told The Mail on Sunday that Peter was ‘in good spirits’ despite suffering serious injuries, including a shattered shoulder. Both pilots were strapped into standard pilot seats and wearing thin flight suits and emergency parachutes when SpaceShipTwo was released from its mothership WhiteKnightTwo shortly after 10am on October 31. The craft’s rocket was ignited at 50,000ft – nearly ten miles above sea level. The pilots, wearing oxygen masks, were pinned against their seats by gravitational forces as the craft accelerated at more than 900mph. Then disaster occurred. Preliminary investigations suggest that the rocket ship’s folding wings – designed to slow it down and achieve safe speeds during landing – deployed early, causing the ship to break up due to the tremendous turbulence around the craft. Alsbury was trapped in the cockpit but Siebold was thrown clear of the wreckage or somehow unbuckled his seatbelt. He then plunged towards Earth at speeds topping 120mph. Witnesses reported seeing Siebold descending with part of the base of his seat still attached. It is likely that his oxygen mask, attached to a portable tank, remained in place. But at that altitude, the sudden decompression and extreme G-forces would have caused him to black out in seconds. His emergency parachute deployed at around 20,000ft. It is not known if he pulled the cord or if it unfurled automatically. Both pilots were wearing parachutes calibrated to open automatically at a certain height in the event they became unconscious during an emergency. Dr Siebold, 79, explained: ‘He doesn’t know how he managed to exit SpaceShipTwo. They don’t have an ejection seat. They have a panel they take out and they have to crawl towards the hole and jump out. But the plane broke up suddenly. I’m sure he was unconscious because he could not have maintained consciousness at 50,000ft. Co-pilot Alsbury was killed in the tragedy over the Mojave Desert . ‘He doesn’t remember anything from the actual crash. He came to during the descent. He must have woken up about halfway down. When he was on the way down the chase plane was circling him and he was waving and giving the thumbs-up to indicate he was all right while he was dangling from the parachute. ‘He’s recovering at home. He broke the head of the humerus bone that sits in the right shoulder. He’s got a rib and lung contusion and there is an issue with his eyes because of the cold. It was around minus 60 degrees up there. ‘It’s a medical miracle he survived considering the temperature, the lack of oxygen and the barotrauma [injury caused by a sudden change in pressure].’ The pilot’s horrified wife, Traci, and children 12-year-old Alexandra and Nick, nine, were standing with the family of Mike Alsbury as the tragedy unfolded. The body of Alsbury, 39, was found still strapped into his seat on a desert road by construction workers. His parachute did not deploy. His wife Michelle said she had ‘lost the love of my life’. Dr Siebold said: ‘Mike’s children and my grandchildren were all watching the flight so the emotional impact of that is tremendous. ‘Mike was a friend and neighbour. Their children are the same age and friends. Peter is asking himself whether he could have done more and why he got out and Mike didn’t? Traci is a strong woman. She’s drained but very much in charge. ‘She’s protecting Peter and she’s holding up incredibly well most of the time. He’s on pain medication, which is making him tired and confused.’ The plane separated mid-air, causing Alsbury, 39, to plummet to the earth while still strapped in his seat . Dr Siebold, who split with Peter’s mother Barbara when his son was five, spoke proudly of teaching his son to fly: ‘Flying was the only thing Peter was ever really interested in. I flew privately – that was my recreation – so he grew up with it. It’s what we did together. We would go to the airport after school.’ At 16, Siebold studied aviation at California State University and landed a job with Scaled Composites – the company conducting last week’s test flight for Virgin Galactic – before he graduated. ‘He worked as an engineer and pilot, starting from the bottom and working his way up,’ Dr Siebold said proudly. Siebold began working as a test pilot and engineer with Virgin Galactic at the start of its space programme a decade ago. ‘He told me straight away he was involved with Virgin Galactic,’ his father continued. ‘Safety was a great concern but I had total confidence in his piloting skills. ‘Peter would say, “These airplanes fly just beautifully.” ‘He was never worried about the safety aspect of it.’ The October 31 flight was so routine that Dr Siebold had no idea his son was piloting the pioneering craft that day until his panicked daughter-in-law phoned: ‘I picked up the phone oblivious to what had happened. I said, “Hi Traci, how are you?” cheerful as usual and she said, “It’s serious. Peter had an accident. We don’t know exactly but it looks like he hurt his shoulder and he’s on his way to the hospital.” ‘We were worried but the main thing was we knew he was alive. ‘I hope he’s going to recover enough to be able to fly again. That’s his life. We’re focusing hour to hour rather than day to day.’ Yesterday, it was revealed that 24 passengers who have paid £157,000 each for the chance to go into space – alongside celebrities including Angelina Jolie and Kate Winslet – have demanded their money back. Virgin Galactic chief executive George Whitesides claimed it was ‘unsurprising’ passengers had pulled out, adding: ‘I think what is relevant is that the vast majority have said, “Don’t give up, keep going, we’re with you.” ’ Before the accident, billionaire Sir Richard Branson vowed he and son Sam would become astronauts by the end of this year and the first space tourist flights would begin next spring. But the Virgin Galactic project has been beset by years of delays and safety fears, including previous accidents with SpaceShipOne which necessitated a redesign of the ship’s engines and fuel. The investigation into this month’s crash is now likely to delay any commercial flight for at least another year. But Branson has vowed to press ahead with the project, while acknowledging the risks taken by his test pilots. Last night, Mr Whitesides paid tribute to Siebold, saying: ‘It will be regarded as one of the most amazing test flight survival stories of all time.’ Dr Klaus Siebold, Peter's father, criticised those who 'rushed' to blame human error for the crash . The father of the Virgin Galactic pilot who survived the crash has hit out at the ‘rush’ to blame human error. Within days of the tragedy, National Transportation and Safety Board (NTSB) staff claimed co-pilot Michael Alsbury, who died, wrongly flicked a safety switch controlling the rocket’s folding wings. That would cause them to deploy at an unsafe speed and ‘feather’ – slowing down the rocket. But Dr Klaus Siebold, father of surviving pilot Peter Siebold, claimed a second switch would have had to be deployed to cause feathering. Dr Siebold, himself a pilot and flight instructor, said: ‘Turning the safety lever won’t automatically feather the tail. ‘The fact that the tail was feathered without a pilot ordering it to do so suggests a mechanical problem, not pilot error. ‘It’s really irresponsible for the NTSB to suggest a possible explanation for the accident with months of investigation still to come.’ A statement on the Virgin Galactic website says: ‘The NTSB indicated that the lock/unlock lever was pulled prematurely based on recorded speed at the time, and they have suggested that subsequent aerodynamic forces then deployed the feathering mechanism, which resulted in the in-flight separation of the wings and vehicle.’ An investigation is now underway to determine the cause of the crash over the Mojave desert .","Virgin Galactic pilot Peter Siebold speaks for the first time after tragic crash .

"Long before Emma Miller, Lucy Watson and even Louise Thompson, there was only one woman for Spencer Matthews and that lady was Caggie Dunlop. In Monday's episode of Made In Chelsea, Spencer even declared that he has never liked anyone as much as Caggie, with whom he had a tumultuous and well-documented relationship spanning two seasons of the reality show. But after her on-off affair with E4's resident lothario took a turbulent turn for the worse, Caggie packed her Louis Vuitton bags and jetted out of London for the bright lights of New York. Scroll down for video . Biggest loser: Caggie Dunlop, who found fame on the first series of Made In Chelsea, hit bootcamp and has shed 7lb in 5 days - she says she can't wait to slip into her little black dress . As . she was: Caggie, pictured before her weight loss, says she loves eating . and while she eats healthy food, she has an issue with portion control. Since her time at No 1 Boot Camp in Norfolk, she has lost 10in overall from her body . Now though, with MIC's new season well under way, it seems that 24-year-old Caggie is back on home turf and keen to remind viewers exactly what Spencer saw in her. The original Made In Chelsea ‘It’ girl has dropped 7lbs in under a week following a gruelling diet and exercise regime at boot camp in Norfolk - and she's happy to show off the results. Speaking to MailOnline, the fashion designer and reality TV star said: 'I've lost 10in all over, which is pretty good. I feel really good but I find it hard to sleep because I'm so alert from all the exercise. 'I really enjoyed it because I like discipline being enforced on me.' Caggie is especially impressed with the results to her derrière, which she claims is the hardest it’s ever been. She giggles: 'If you slap it, there’s barely a wobble now!' Tough times: The bootcamp in Norfolk saw Caggie crawling through mud and eating smaller portions - she says she loves being disciplined and will try her best to keep up the regime (apart from the mud!) Thanks to the hardcore training - which includes mud-wrestling, early-morning cardio, hiking and yoga - the 24 year old also toned up her tricky middle section, 'The muffin top… like most women, I think, that’s where extra weight goes first. The tummy and hips! It’s also the hardest to shift,' she said. 'I’m not exactly big, so can’t quite believe that I’ve lost seven pounds.' Caggie was, however, horrified to see that her food portions were out of control. 'I am a real foodie, I have an unhealthy habit with eating and I could easily have eaten three times the amount we were served,' she admits. 'But it’s about waiting a while to see whether you’re full. I normally eat pretty healthily anyway, but I would usually have more carbs at home. I work out five days a week and do running, yoga and pilates. Singer Caggie - who earlier this year was linked to Kelly Brook's cheating ex Danny Cipriani - also spotted benefits to her face. 'My eyes are much brighter!' Friends in high places: Caggie and Millie Mackintosh have remained good friends since leaving the E4 show that propelled them to fame; Caggie even attended Millie's wedding to Professor Gree . 'I’m now looking forward to a facial and beautifying myself a bit, which is a great boost as I'm off to Los Angeles for various acting meetings. 'I’m pretty good at disciplining myself if I gain a little so I’ve never had a weight issue. But I’m looking forward to pulling on my black bandage dress. It’s pretty unforgiving anyway but you have to be small to get in it. 'I’m going to stick to a 5:2 plan - be strict for five days then do and eat what the hell I feel like the other two.' As well as working on her figure at No 1 Boot Camp, Caggie has been in Los Angeles, where she's attended meetings about acting opportunities. She has also been focusing on her fashion range, ISWAI ('it starts with an idea'), which is similar to Asos and sells garments from up-and-coming labels, as well as those designed by Caggie herself. 'ISWAI has been taking up a lot of my time but I'm excited for the future of it because I think it has real potential,' she said . The former reality TV star will be spending the weekend celebrating her 25th birthday with the help of co-stars Jamie Laing and, you guessed it, Spencer Matthews. Former flame: Caggie and Spencer Matthews had an on-off relationship on the show and he recently revealed that he's never liked anyone as much as her. Sorry, Spennie - Caggie is seeing someone else now.. Fashion face: Caggie has also created her own version of ASOS - a hub where she sells up-and-coming designers' clothes, as well as creations she has worked on herself. The 24-year-old says she sees 'real potential' for the site . But sadly for Spencer, Caggie is seeing someone. 'Spencer is relentless!,' she laughs when asked about his undying affection. However, there could be hope as Caggie reveals she would 'never say never' to returning to the E4 show that sky-rocketed her to fame. 'My return to Made In Chelsea depends on what happens in LA,' she muses. 'I do feel like I have left it behind though and that it would be closing doors. 'I considered a cameo appearance in the New York episode but had other, better opportunities come up at the same time - however, I'd never say never.'","Former Made In Chelsea star hits gruelling bootcamp .

"Two Palestinians, including a 13-year-old boy, have been killed by Israeli soldiers carrying out raids linked to the search for three teenagers believed to have been abducted in the West Bank. Mohammed Dodeen, whose funeral has already taken place, is believed to have been killed by a bullet to the chest during army raids in Dura refugee camp in the Palestinian territory this morning. The army also opened fire during a raid in the nearby Qalandiya refugee camp, leaving three Palestinians seriously wounded, and killing 23-year-old Mustafa Aslan - bringing the total number killed during raids by Israeli soldiers this week to three. The deaths come as Israel condemned the United Nations for refusing to say the missing teenagers had been abducted, condemning their stance on the matter as 'hypocritical', as well as 'out of touch, out of line and out of time'. Grief: Mohammed Dodeen (pictured) is believed to have been killed by a bullet to the chest during army raids in Dura refugee camp in the Palestinian territory this morning. The army also opened fire during a raid in the nearby Qalandiya refugee camp . Funeral: Mohammed Dodeen's death came during a raid in Dura by the Israeli army. Over the past week, thousands of soldiers have searched locations in the West Bank and arrested more than 300 Palestinians, many from Hamas. The total number of Palestinians killed by the soldiers during the raids now stands at three . Anger: A large number of Palestinians carry the body of 13-year-old Mohamed Dodeen during his funeral in the West Bank village of Dura this afternoon . Outpouring: Hundreds of Palestinians turned out for the funeral of Mohammed Dodeen. A hospital official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to media, said the 13-year-old was killed by a bullet in the chest . The three Jewish seminary students disappeared June 12 while hitchhiking in the West Bank. Israel has blamed the Islamic militant Hamas group for the apparent abduction, but has offered no proof for the claims. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has used the search to promote two other objectives - a new crackdown on Hamas and an attempt to discredit the Palestinian unity government formed earlier this month by Western-backed President Mahmoud Abbas, which is supported by Hamas. Hamas has praised the alleged abduction of the teenagers but has not claimed responsibility for it. The group has abducted Israelis in the past to press for the release of thousands of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. In Hebron, families of Palestinians arrested recently in Israeli raids protested after weekly Muslim prayers. They gestured with three fingers, one for each missing teen, in a sign of their support for the alleged abduction. The gesture has become popular on social media among Palestinians and others who support the abductions of Israelis. In a video posted on YouTube yesterday, Israel accused the UN of hypocrisy for it's stance on the matter. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon initially expressed solidarity with the teens' families and called for them to be released, but the UN subsequently went back on the statement, saying it could not prove that the three boys had been kidnapped. Israel's mission to the UN expressed anger at the statement, adding: 'The UN is out of touch, out of line and out of time.' Arrests: The Israeli military said it conducted raids in four towns and refugee camps early this morning, detaining 25 suspects and searching about 200 locations. They said they had searched nine institutions linked to Hamas and had confiscated various material .

In the Qalandiya refugee camp, a soldier was lightly hurt by a grenade thrown at the many troops involved in the operation . Over the past week, thousands of Israeli . troops have searched hundreds of locations in the West Bank and arrested . more than 300 Palestinians, many from Hamas. The Israeli military said it conducted raids in four towns and refugee camps early this morning, detaining 25 suspects and searching about 200 locations. The army said it searched nine institutions linked to Hamas and confiscated materials. In one raid, in the town of Dura near Hebron, Palestinian youths threw stones at soldiers, drawing army fire. A hospital official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to media, said 13-year-old Mohammed Dodeen was killed by a bullet in the chest. The official had earlier said he was 15. The army also opened fire during a raid in the Qalandiya refugee camp, where three Palestinians were seriously wounded, said Ahmed Bitawi, director of Ramallah's hospital. One of the three, 23-year-old Mustafa Aslan, later died of his wounds.

Suspicions: Israeli soldiers surround the Islamic Charitable Society in the West Bank as the prepare to enter the building due to suspected links with Hamas . A senior Israeli intelligence officer today said that anyone linked to Hamas was potentially a target for arrest. He acknowledged that despite recent government declarations of a major crackdown on Hamas, both Israel and Abbas' Palestinian Authority have already dismantled much of the movement's West Bank infrastructure in recent years. 'But there are a lot of small places that are supporting Hamas,"" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with military briefing regulations. 'We'll go to every place that has a sign of Hamas on it, and we're going to hit it. Whether it's small or large. We really don't look only for the big symbols. There are no big symbols ... the Palestinian Authority did it [the crackdown] before and we did it.' One of the locations targeted yesterday was the office of the Islamic student union at the West Bank's Bir Zeit University. A military spokesman said Hamas paraphernalia were confiscated as well as computers and databases, which are being searched. Hamas activists said they had used the office to store materials for protests, such as flags and posters commemorating slain militants.","Mohammed Dodeen, 13, and Mustafa Aslan, 23, were shot dead by the Israeli military during raids this morning .

"A 17-year-old girl who was obsessed with the Columbine High School massacre wrote about 'picking off' her classmates 'one by one' and blowing up the cafeteria, police have said. Administrators at Radnor High School in Pennsylvania alerted police after learning the senior had allegedly been scrawling the terrifying plans in her notebooks. The girl wrote about killing a teacher and other students before injuring herself, said Radnor Township Police Superintendent William Colarulo, as he shared the journal excerpts on Monday. 'I could be the first female shooter,' the student, who has not been named because she is a juvenile, wrote in her journal, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. 'I'm homicidal, and I'm fine with that.' Scroll down for video . Terrifying: Police shared pages out of a teenager's notebook that allegedly detail how she wanted to attack the school in a Columbine massacre-like attack. She is now undergoing psychiatric evaluation . Sick: The journal described how she wanted to 'pierce kids around me' and 'flood the halls with corpses' Colarulo said that the teenager was obsessed with serial killers and read a lot about torture, ABC6 reported. Her journal excerpts detailed her alleged plan of attack on the school. 'I want to trap them, pick them off one by one,' she wrote. 'Blow up the cafeteria, shoot everyone in classrooms. 'Imagine the power, the bullets leaving the gun with a loud bang, piercing kids around me, the way they collapse, their blood splattering the floor... the screams.' Another page was filled with large capital letters reading: 'I am fire, I am flames. I exude danger, you should fear me, I am dangerous, you better believe me, you have no idea what I can do.' Concern: Radnor Township Police Superintendent William Colarulo said the girl's locker and home had been searched and no weapons had been found. He said she is 'getting the help she needs' 'Obsessed': She also wrote a letter to the parents of one of the Columbine shooters, Dylan Klebold, saying she had read his journal and 'I connected very strongly with your son emotionally' 'I could be the first female shooter... I'm homicidal, and I'm fine with that' 'I am about to get very violent... So close to exploding' 'I want to trap them, pick them off one by one. Blow up the cafeteria, maybe.

Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, killed a teacher and 12 students before taking their lives during the shooting in Littleton, Colorado in April 1999. They also injured 21 people. In the letter, the girl wrote that she had read his journal and 'connected very strongly with your son emotionally'. 'We would be remiss if we didn't take these threats seriously,' Colarulo said at the press conference. 'There are always warning signs. If you want to go back and reference the Columbine incident, there were numerous warning signs that went ignored, that went unnoticed and nobody took the proper action and made the report.' He added that students were not in any danger. After receiving the call from the school, police searched the student's home and her school locker and no weapons were found.

"UKIP leader Nigel Farage was tonight selected to run for the party in the South Thanet constituency in next year's general election. Mr Farage was selected ahead of three other shortlisted candidates as the party's prospective candidate for the Kent seat. Delegates backed Mr Farage after a hustings session at Old Fellows Hall in Ramsgate. Scroll down for video . UKIP leader Nigel Farage believes he will win five seats at the next election including South Thanet . Nigel Farage, pictured, said he was not guaranteed to be nominated for UKIP just because of his rank . South Thanet - Conservative . Boston & Skegness - Conservative . North Thanet - Conservative . Sittingborne and Sheppey- Conservative . Forest of Dean - Conservative . Aylesbury - Conservative . Great Yarmouth - Conservative . East Worthing - Conservative . Thurrock - Conservative . Grimsby - Labour . Eastleigh - Lib Dem . Portsmouth South - Lib Dem . The seat is currently held by Conservative Laura Sandys, who is standing down at the next election. She had a majority of 7,617 in 2010. Mr Farage beat family lawyer Elizabeth Jones, barrister Piers Wauchope and Peter Bucklitsch, a fellow of the Institute of Financial Accountants. Many had viewed Mr Farage's selection as a formality, but ahead of hustings he insisted he was 'no shoo-in' and said that 'rank means nothing' in UKIP. He will now go on to fight for the South Thanet seat against Craig MacKinlay, the former UKIP leader chosen to stand for the Conservatives. Ian Driver has been selected as the Greens' prospective parliamentary candidate, Will Scobie for Labour and Russ Timpson for the Liberal Democrats. UKIP will concentrate on 12 marginal constituencies – mostly held by Tories – as it battles to win its first seats in Parliament. Nigel Farage's party are set to focus on nine Tory-held seats – but just one Labour and two Lib Dem constituencies. In many of the target seats, Labour finished in second place in the last general election, meaning a surge in UKIP support could see the Tories losing crucial seats to Ed Miliband. Labour advisers have calculated that Mr Miliband will become Prime Minister if UKIP wins more than nine per cent of the vote. The list of target seats is based on private internal polling leaked to Sky News. Sky News reported that UKIP feel confident of winning five seats at the election including South Thanet . UKIP strategists believe they can win up to five seats in the general election next year, it was reported by the Telegraph today. The seats UKIP are allegedly targeting are: South Thanet, Boston and Skegness, North Thanet, Sittingborne and Sheppey, Forest of Dean, Aylebury, Great Yarmouth, East Worthing, Thurrock, Grimsby, Eastleigh and Portsmouth. Three of the seats are held by Tory ministers. Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, is Mark Harper, the welfare minister's seat, while Great Yarmouth is held by Brandon Lewis, the planning minister. One of the 11 seats being targeted by UKIP is currently held by Labour while two are held by the Lib Dems . Aylesbury meanwhile is held by David Lidington, the Europe minister. Just one of the UKIP targets – Great Grimsby – is held by Labour. The sitting MP at the moment is Austin Mitchell – but he is retiring next year amid complaints over party sexism. The pro-EU Lib Dems are not immune from the UKIP threat. Mr Farage's party is targeting Eastleigh, where Ukip finished second in the 2013, and Portsmouth South, where Mike Hancock is under pressure over sexual harassment allegations. UKIP is targeting a host of seats in the south and east of England in a bid to break into Parliament at the next election .

"Tragic: Christopher Shaw (right, here with 10-year-old Cressida and ex-wife Lady Mary Gaye Curzon) has been found dead at his home in Salisbury . The stepfather of Prince Harry’s girlfriend Cressida Bonas has died suddenly in what friends say was a suspected suicide. Christopher Shaw, the one-time merchant banker, who wed Cressida’s mother, Lady Mary Gaye Curzon, during the Nineties at a time when he was one of London’s most lavish and generous party-throwers, is believed to have killed himself. Shaw, 76, was suffering from ill-health and was said by friends to have been plagued by money worries. Bon viveur Shaw fell madly in love with society beauty Mary Gaye who was previously married to Cressida’s father, businessman Jeffrey Bonas — he created a cocktail in her honour at Claridge’s called The Curzon. Shaw was found dead by his housekeeper, Nicky, at his rented home in The Close by Salisbury Cathedral — virtually next door to Sir Edward Heath’s former home. He is believed to have committed suicide by taking an overdose,friends said today. Despite his financial problems Christopher, who celebrated his 76th birthday on New Year’s Day, had been in good spirits having just returned from a holiday in Cuba with the latest woman in his life. He was on medication for chronic kidney disease and friends say he had been told two years ago he might have only 18 months to live. Police were called to the house on Friday. A post mortem is to be carried out, but last night Wiltshire police said there were no suspicious circumstances. The son of a country parson and a former head boy at Eton, father-of-three Shaw lived with Mary Gaye at the sprawling National Trust mansion Hinton Ampner in Hampshire, where he entertained in style with eight servants and five gardeners. He also had a set in the Albany building. Guests at his parties included Sir Richard Branson and Rupert Murdoch. ‘He was unique,’ says his long-time friend PR supremo David Wynne-Morgan. ‘He decided at Eton that he wanted to live like a 19th-century landed aristocrat and he did just that.’ Married: The couple were together from 1992 and married in 1994 until 2000, when Cressida was 11. He was notorious for his lavish parties in London while they couple were together . Boyfriend: Prince Harry was in London today for a press conference about his charity trek across Antarctica . Influence: Married to her mother when she was aged five to 11, Mr Shaw was a huge influence on the upbringing of Prince Harry's girlfriend Cressida . Shaw was married first to banker Loel . Guinness’s niece Liza Gard, then to a Frenchwoman, and fell for . thrice-married Mary Gaye in 1994. They were together for six years, . married for four, but divorced in 2000. ‘Cressida . was five when they got together and 11 when it all went wrong, so . Christopher would have been a strong presence in her childhood life,’ says a friend. Shaw’s last . regular live-in lover was Eliza Dugdale, former wife of dashing huntsman . Robin Smith-Ryland on whom Jilly Cooper based one of her bonkbusters. They were together for more than a decade til splitting around 18 months ago, since when she is said to have fallen for a Canadian man. Besotted: Mr Shaw fell madly in love with society beauty Mary Gaye - even naming a cocktail after her at Claridge's called The Curzon .

"Our galaxy can be a very dusty place, and supernovae are thought to be a main source of that dust - especially in the early universe. But up until now, there has been very little direct evidence of a supernova's dust‐making capabilities. The little evidence astronomers did have could not account for the massive amount of dust detected in young, distant galaxies. Now new images of the famed Supernova 1987A have, for the first time, captured the remains of the exploding star brimming with freshly formed dust. This artist's illustration shows Supernova 1987A, based on real data with the cold, inner regions of the exploded star's remnants (in red) where tremendous  amounts of dust were detected and imaged. This inner region is contrasted with the outer shell (lacy white and blue circles), where the blast wave from the supernova is colliding with the envelope of gas ejected  from the star prior to its powerful detonation . If enough of this dust makes the perilous transition into interstellar space, it could explain how many galaxies acquired their dusty, dusky appearance. ‘We have found a remarkably large dust mass concentrated in the central part of the ejecta from a relatively young and nearby supernova,’ said Remy Indebetouw, an astronomer at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Charlottesville. ‘This is the first time we've been able to really image where the dust has formed, which is important in understanding the evolution of galaxies.’ An international team of astronomers used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescope to observe the glowing remains of Supernova 1987A. This image shows the remnant of Supernova 1987A  in light of very different wavelengths. The ALMA Telescope data (in red) shows newly formed dust in the centre of the remnant as Hubble (in green) and Chandra (in blue) data show the expanding shock wave . In February of 1987 astronomers observing the Large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby dwarf galaxy, noticed the sudden appearance of what looked like a new star. In fact they weren’t watching the beginnings of a star but the end of one and the brightest supernova seen from Earth in the four centuries since the telescope was invented. By the next morning news of the discovery had spread across the globe and southern hemisphere stargazers began watching the aftermath of this enormous stellar explosion, known as a supernova. In the two and a half decades since then, the remnant of Supernova 1987A has continued to be a focus for researchers around the world, providing a wealth of information about one of the Universe’s most extreme events. Located more than 160,000 light years away, the light of the catastrophic explosion only reached Earth in February 1987. Before it exploded, the star generated huge amounts of gas, including a thick, dense, clumpy ring more than a light year across. Astronomers predicted that as the gas cooled after the explosion, large amounts of dust would form as atoms of oxygen, carbon, and silicon bonded together in the cold central regions of the remnant. However, earlier observations of SN 1987A with infrared telescopes, made during the first 500 days after the explosion, detected only a small amount of hot dust. Using, the research team was able to image the far more abundant cold dust, which glows brightly in millimetre and submillimetre light. The astronomers estimate that the remnant now contains about 25 per cent the mass of the sun in newly formed dust. They also found that significant amounts of carbon monoxide and silicon monoxide have formed. ‘SN 1987A is a special place since it hasn't mixed with the surrounding environment, so what we see there was made there,’ said Dr Indebetouw. ‘The new ALMA results, which are the first of their kind, reveal a supernova remnant chock full of material that simply did not exist a few decades ago.’ Supernovae, however, can both create and destroy dust grains. As the shockwave from the initial explosion radiated out into space, it produced bright glowing rings of material, as seen in earlier observations with the Hubble Telescope. After hitting this envelope of gas, which . was sloughed off by the progenitor red giant star as it neared the end . of its life, a portion of this powerful explosion rebounded back towards . the centre of the remnant. Last year, a team of astronomers led by the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) produced incredible high resolution radio images of the expanding SN 1987A remnant at millimetre wavelengths. In this image contours of different wavelengths of radio emissions and a Hubble space telescope image of Supernova 1987A combined to provide a unique view of its death throes . Cosmic dust consists of tiny particles of solid material floating around in the space between the stars. Unlike the dust you find in your house, it is more like smoke with small particles varying from collections of just a few molecules to grains of 0.1 mm in size. D . It helps stars form, and it is also the raw material from which planets like the Earth are created. Supernovae are thought to be a main source of that dust - especially in the early universe. But . up until now, there has been very little direct evidence of a . supernova's dust‐making capabilities, and could not account for the . massive amount of dust detected in young, distant galaxies. ‘At some point, this rebound shockwave will slam into these billowing clumps of freshly minted dust,’ said Dr Indebetouw. ‘It's likely that some fraction of the dust will be blasted apart at that point. It's hard to predict exactly how much — maybe only a little, possibly a half or two thirds.’ If a good fraction survives and makes it into interstellar space, it could account for the copious dust astronomers detect in the early universe. ‘Really early galaxies are incredibly dusty and this dust plays a major role in the evolution of galaxies,’ added Mikako Matsuura of University College London, UK. ‘Today we know dust can be created in several ways, but in the early universe most of it must have come from supernovae. We finally have direct evidence to support that theory.’ In 1987 astronomers observing the Large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby dwarf galaxy, noticed the sudden appearance of what looked like a new star.

"A friend of Officer Darren Wilson has reportedly come to his defense saying that the cop shot and killed Michael Brown because the teen tried to grab his gun, punched him in the face and then charged at him. A woman calling herself 'Josie' called a local St Louis radio station on Friday claiming to be a friend of the 28-year-old Ferguson police officer. The woman, who said she was a friend of the cop's girlfriend, said friends and family were too afraid to speak out but she wanted the public to know that Brown, 18, had 'bum-rushed' Officer Wilson prior to the shooting. Scroll down for video . A woman called Josie called a St Louis radio station this weekend in defense of Michael Brown shoot Darren Wilson (pictured). She said that Brown had rushed at the officer after trying to grab his gun and punching him . Josie said that on August 9, Wilson came across Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson walking down the middle of a street in the St Louis suburb and pulled up to tell them to get on to the sidewalk. 'He pulled up ahead of them. And then he got a call-in that there was a strong-arm robbery. And, they gave a description,' the friend told The Dana Show. 'And, he’s looking at them and they got something in their hands and it looks like it could be what, you know those cigars or whatever. So he goes in reverse back to them. Michael Brown was shot dead on August 9 by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri . 'Tries to get out of his car. They slam his door shut violently. I think he said Michael did. And, then he opened the car again. He tried to get out. He stands up. 'And then Michael just bum-rushes him and shoves him back into his car. Punches him in the face and them Darren grabs for his gun. Michael grabbed for the gun. At one point he got the gun entirely turned against his hip. 'And he shoves it away. And the gun goes off. 'Well, then Michael takes off and gets to be about 35 feet away. And, Darren’s first protocol is to pursue. 'So, he stands up and yells, ''Freeze!'' Michael and his friend turn around. 'And Michael taunts him… And then all the sudden he just started bum-rushing him. He just started coming at him full speed. So [Wilson] really thinks [Brown] was on something, because he just kept coming. It was unbelievable. 'And so he finally ended up, the final shot was in the forehead, and then he fell about two to three feet in front of the officer.' The friend's report, which has not been verified, added to the growing number of different versions of events from the day of the fatal shooting. Wilson is now on paid administrative leave following the shooting and pending the outcome of the investigation. The 28-year-old officer won a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' in February  this year. 'He never intended for any of this to happen,' Ferguson police Chief Thomas Jackson said. 'It’s devastating, absolutely devastating.' Assistant pathologist Shawn Parcells told CNN on Monday afternoon that it cannot be proved from the initial autopsy whether Brown was rushing the officer or simply standing at a distance. Earlier on Monday, an eye-witness to the shooting released a video of Brown in the street with Wilson pacing back and forth beside his lifeless body in the street. Piaget Crenshaw lives in an apartment with a balcony overlooking the street where the 18-year-old was killed.  She said today that she waited until now to release the video as she feared for her safety and the officer's name had not been released. She told CNN today that she had recorded the incident because she believed that something was wrong. Officer Darren Wilson looks at the body of teenager Michael Brown lying dead in a Missouri street last Saturday after he fired multiple shots . 'From it all initially happening, I knew this was not right,' Miss Crenshaw said. 'I knew the police shouldn't have been chasing this boy and firing at the same time. And the fact he got shot in his face, something clicked in me and I thought someone else should see this so I recorded.' The radio caller's version of events also contradicted the statement of Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson who said at press conference on Friday that Officer Wilson was unaware of the store robbery when he stopped Brown. Chief Jackson released the name of Officer Wilson last Friday after mounting public pressure. He had waited after saying that the officer received death threats on social media. The Brown family's lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said on Monday that the teenager had been 'executed in broad daylight' as the results of their independent autopsy were revealed. Professor Shawn Parcells points on Monday to one of the shots that hit teen Michael Brown during a preliminary autopsy report conducted on behalf of the family . Michael Brown died from a 'kill shot' to the top of the head, medical examiner Dr Michael Baden revealed today - but could have survived his five other bullet wounds. Dr Baden told a press conference in Ferguson, Missouri on Monday that he had reassured the teen's mother, Lesley McSpadden, that her son did not suffer. The family's autopsy, which was released on Sunday, revealed the unarmed 18-year-old had been shot at least six times by Wilson. Eye-witnesses have also claimed that Brown had his hands up to signal that he was surrendering. The shooting of the unarmed black teenager has sparked eight days of protests in the once quiet Missouri suburb. Protests over the teen's shooting on August 9 had seen looting and violence in the area. Following a brief calm, trouble returned at the end of last week, prompting Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to put a curfew in place from midnight to 5am. Nixon lifted the curfew on Monday while ordering the National Guard to help restore order. He deployed the Guard Monday following an overnight clash between armored police and what he called ‘a violent criminal element intent upon terrorizing the community'. Nixon said the Guard will be under the direction of the state Highway Patrol. Police advance through a cloud of tear gas toward demonstrators protesting the killing of teenager Michael Brown on Sunday night. The National Guard has now been deployed in Ferguson .","A woman claiming to be a friend of Darren Wilson told a St Louis radio station  the cop HAD heard the 911 dispatch about the strong-armed robbery .

"Many people suffer a bad night’s sleep because they are woken up by their partner’s snoring. But now a smart pillow could put an end to noisy nights as it can gently push a snorer into a new position to stop their snoring or wake them up gently – leaving their partner to slumber in peace. The ‘snore activated nudging pillow’ is fitted with an integrated microphone that picks up the sonic vibrations of snoring. No more sleepless nights: The 'snore activated nudging pillow' (pictured) is fitted with an integrated microphone that picks up the sonic vibrations of snoring . The pillow’s integrated microphone picks up the sonic vibrations of snoring. It automatically inflates an internal air bladder that increases the pillow’s depth by 3inches. This elevation can open up a person's airways to prevent them from snoring. The moment is also just enough to nudge a sleeper - perhaps onto their side. which also reduces snoring. A control panel on the side of the device lets people set the sensitivity of the microphone and the depth of the nudge.The pillow has a power lead to plug into an electricity socket. It then inflates an internal air pocket which makes the pillow three inches taller, which its creators believe is just enough to make a sleeper move their head or body. Sleeping on your side reduces snoring because the base of the tongue will not collapse into the back of the throat to obstruct breathing. The elevated angle of the pillow similarly opens a person's airways or prompts them to move into a better sleeping position - perhaps by rolling onto their side. The device has a 30-minute delay setting to allow the user to fall asleep, without the pillow inflating and the microphone's sensitivity can be adjusted for light or heavy snoring. Using a panel of buttons on the side of the soft device, users can set the snore pillow’s sensitivity to suit their needs.

"The carriage horse who tragically died in the street as bystanders watched was today revealed to have been in severe pain before it collapsed. White horse Charlie, 15, keeled over as he made a morning commute from his stables to Central Park in Manhattan, New York, on October 23. Now an autopsy of the horse whose death prompted huge public grief shows he had chronic ulcers in his stomach and a fractured tooth. Tragic: The New York carriage horse collapsed and died in the street as it made the early morning commute from its stables to Central Park to begin its shift . The American Society for the . Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) performed the autopsy at . Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Charlie was a newcomer to the industry after being transferred from an Amish farm just weeks before he died, reported Gawker. ‘We are very concerned that Charlie was forced to work in spite of painful maladies,’ ASPCA spokesman Dr Pamela Corey said. She said these health issues can be . tricky to diagnose because the horse would not be ‘displaying signs of . pain until they are very severe’. Outrage: Campaigners argue that the number of collisions and the suffering of the animals make the cost of the industry too high . Dead: The horse that died in New York on October 23 is covered with a tarpaulin before being loaded into a police vehicle . The death fuelled the argument of . animal rights activists for the 220 horses to be taken off the streets . in New York permanently.

"PSG midfielder Yohan Cabaye has admitted he is 'not happy' with his bit-part role in the French champions' side under Laurent Blanc. The former Newcastle United man, who moved to Ligue 1 last January for £19million, played just 15 minutes of the 1-1 draw with Monaco at the weekend, and hasn't been at the forefront of Blanc's mind. Cabaye has had to settle for the bench on a few occassions this season, and with PSG struggling for form with three league wins all season, the French international says he is not used to being left out. Cabaye (right) in training with the French national team ahead of their Euro 2016 qualifiers . He told L'Equipe: 'You have to accept being a substitute, but I don't resign myself to that. In training sessions, I have to give my best and show my desire to play. 'When I am on the pitch, I feel it is not perfect and that I often have to leave too soon. But I know the coach and staff have to make choices and I respect that. 'Have I spoken to Laurent Blanc? No. What do I tell him? I am 28 years old and not new to the job. But I am not satisfied with the situation. 'Am I completely happy? To be honest, no. It is a new situation for me, but I don't complain. It is the first time I haven't played regularly for my club. 'With the French team, if one day the national team coach decides to play me less because I don't play often enough for my club, then I would need to take stock with my representatives.' Cabaye could be back in the Premier League by January, having left Newcastle 10 months ago . Cabaye (left), a £19million signing, came on in the 71st minute of the famous 3-2 win over Barcelona . With Cabaye suggesting he is unhappy in Paris, a host of Premier League clubs will be on alert in an attempt to prise him away in January. Arsenal were thought to be heavily interested in Cabaye before he left for PSG. He said: 'Do I sometimes miss England? Yes. Sometimes I think about it, but I immediately sweep that away because it would cause distraction. 'I am at the Parc des Princes and I need to find the right atmosphere.' Many Newcastle fans will have predicted this outcome when their star midfielder left St James' Park, while Cabaye will assume his price tag alone will have secured him a more regular place in the team. Cabaye came on in the 71st minute of the famous 3-2 win over Barcelona last week, and endured a torrid start to the campaign after being sent off in the 0-0 draw at Evian in August. Cabaye played 21 games for the club last season, scoring just once. Like our Arsenal Facebook page. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger may be on alert at Cabaye's comments in the French capital .

"The British boss of Indian car giant Tata Motors jumped to his death from a Bangkok hotel room following a blazing row with his wife, it emerged yesterday. Karl Slym was handed a three-page letter by his wife Sally detailing a ‘family problem’ on Saturday night after she became so enraged she stopped speaking to him. In the early hours of Sunday the managing director clambered out of the tiny window of his room on the 22nd floor of the luxury Shangri-La Hotel and jumped, landing on the staff accommodation block. Fall: British-born Karl Slym, managing director of India's Tata Motors has died after reportedly 'jumping' from a hotel balcony . Mr Slym was handed a three-page document by his wife Sally detailing a 'family issue' on the night he died . Karl Slym and his wife Sally, who had travelled to Thailand with her husband, during an awards ceremony . Mrs Slym had accompanied her 51-year-old husband to Bangkok for a board meeting of Tata Motors’ Thailand unit, but the couple were overheard engaged in a loud and bitter fight on Saturday night. After giving her husband the letter she went to sleep, and only learned of his death from police officers who knocked on her hotel room door on Sunday morning. Mrs Slym was treated for shock and was later interviewed by Thai police. She told them: ‘We rowed and rowed about family business from about 7pm. Then I wrote a long letter and went to bed.’ A Thai police source added: ‘The wife said that they had rowed so much about a family problem that she could not talk to her husband any more. They had been fighting and it had become very loud. Mr Slym's body was discovered by staff on a ledge on the fourth floor of the riverside Shangri-La hotel . Mr Slym, with an employee at a plant in Halol, was heard arguing with his wife on Saturday night . Mr Slym and his wife were not talking the last time they saw on another, police said today . ‘She went to the bedroom and decided to write her husband a letter to let him know how she felt. She gave it to her husband and then went to sleep.’ Officers declined to give details of the family problem. Police Lieutenant Somyot Booyakaew said detectives found no sign of a struggle and were working on the assumption that Mr Slym committed suicide. He said: ‘We can rule out murder. There was no sign of a struggle, no sign of force being used. The room was tidy. ‘We found a window open. The window was very small so it was not possible that he would have slipped. He would have had to climb through the window to fall out because he was a big man. From my initial investigation we believe he jumped.’ Officers did not detail the nature of the Slym's family problem - which led to arguments between the pair . Mrs Slym watches the Royal Wedding at an event in Delhi. She is being treated for shock following the death . He added: ‘Yes they did argue. The wife wrote the note because she wanted her husband to know some personal things.’ An examination of a three-page note written in English  confirmed it had been written by Mrs Slym. A post-mortem examination revealed Mr Slym died from a broken skull as well as injuries to his brain and other internal organs consistent with a fall from his 22nd-floor room. The couple, both from Derby, married in 1984 and would have celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary this summer. They met after Mr Slym had a car accident and his future wife, who worked in insurance, helped him complete the paperwork. They had no children. His work took him to postings around the world and the couple set up home more than nine times in seven countries before settling in India and buying a house. Thai police say they have ruled out the possibility of murder as 'there was no sign of a struggle' The letter was found in Mr Slym's hotel room (stock image pictured) Tata Motors’ share price fell more than 6 per cent yesterday following news of the executive’s death. Tata declined to comment on the cause of Mr Slym’s death, saying it had not had an official report from the police about it. But chairman Cyrus P Mistry said Mr Slym had been a ‘valued colleague who was providing strong leadership at a challenging time for the Indian auto industry’. He added: ‘In this hour of grief, our thoughts are with Karl’s wife and family.’ Last night a friend of Mr Slym said: ‘He was a fantastic colleague and a great family man. He worked hard but he also enjoyed the good things in life.’ A talented engineer, Mr Slym was head-hunted by Tata in October 2012 in the hope of turning around the firm’s ailing fortunes. He had previously worked for General Motors and Toyota UK. He was due to be interviewed as part of a corporate fraud investigation into General Motors India that led to the recall of over 100,000 cars. Last night General Motors said the company had nothing to hide. Businessman: Mr Slym, pictured with the Tata Aria model, had been in Bangkok for a board meeting of Tata's Thailand unit .

"Controversial: Nurses could soon be allowed to perform abortions within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy . Nurses in California could soon be allowed to perform abortions within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Nurse practitioners and certified nurse-midwives would be allowed to perform abortions instead of doctors. Supporters of the bill - which has passed the Californian legislature -  say increasing access to abortions in the early stages of pregnancy would be safer for women. They say it will decrease abortions in the latter stages of pregnancy which are more expensive and dangerous. The bill would allow non-physicians to perform 'manual vacuum aspiration abortions' which  involve inserting a small tube attached to a pump into the uterus which removes fetal tissue. Before they would be allowed to carry out the procedure themselves, nurses would have . to conduct at least 40 abortions under direct supervision before receiving an assessment . Speaking to The Huffington Post, Assemblywoman Toni Atkins, who wrote the measure, said there is a huge lack of  abortion providers in California. She said: 'All women should have timely access to reproductive health care, regardless of whether they live in urban or rural areas and without excessive expense or travel.' A number of groups are opposed to the bill including the California Right to Life . Committee, the California Catholic Conference. They say it could lead to health risks. Speaking to the Huffington Post, the California Catholic Conference said: 'It is surprising that the legislature would consider . approving this lowered standard of care for women, when possible . complications from an abortion include incomplete abortion, hemorrhage, . infection, cervical injury and uterine perforation -- and in rare cases, . death.' The bill has easily passed the Assembly and the Senate and now awaits approval of amendments before it goes to Governor Jerry Brown. Change: Nurse practitioners, certified nurse-midwives and physician assistants would be allowed to perform abortions instead of doctors. This is a file picture of a nurse . A University of California study earlier this year found that trained non-physicians can provide early abortion care that is clinically as safe as physicians. Opponents say more providers are not needed becasue California already has the highest rate of abortion in the U.S.","Supporters say increasing access to abortions .

"The former boyfriend of Amanda Knox has spoken of how his life is 'on hold' as he faces a retrial over the murder of British exchange student Meredith Kercher.

'I cannot find a normal life, a job, a . career or something to focus on instead of thinking about the trial, . about the documents, about what will happen, about how to pay lawyers, . how to pay my bills,' he said. Sollecito has always denied any involvement in the killing of the Leeds University student. She . was found with her throat slashed in the bedroom of the house in Perugia . in central Italy that she shared with American Miss Knox in November . 2007. The pair were found guilty in December . 2009 of murdering Miss Kercher, with Miss Knox sentenced to 26 years in . prison and Mr Sollecito 25. But, after an 11-month appeal in a Perugia court, both convictions were thrown out in October 2011.Prosecutors claimed that Miss Kercher was the victim of a drug-fuelled sex game gone awry.

Mr Sollecito has defended himself against claims that he and Miss Knox had made money out of the tragedy. He has said he wants Italian prosecutors to read his book to find out the facts about the case. Speaking about his romance with Miss .

Crime scene: Sen was struck by the train and killed at the 40th Street station near Queens Boulevard in Sunnyside, pictured . Police reportedly tried in vain to question a muttering Menendez, who at one point inquired after the R train's location. 'All I know is that she's bipolar and as far as seeing the footage, I'm pretty sure it was her,' a cousin of the suspect told the Post. The doorman at the  Rego Park building where Menendez’s mother and stepfather  live said she visited her folks regularly. 'I know her. . . . You could tell that  something was not right, like she needed medication or something,' the  anonymous doorman told The New York Daily News. 'It’s just very sad what  happened.' Menendez later confessed at the 112th Precinct House in Forest Hills, Queens that she did, indeed, push Sen, 46, a Calcutta native, . into the 7 train's path.

As of Saturday evening, she awaited formal arraignment, and could not be reached for comment. It was unclear if she had an attorney. The New York Daily News reported Sen had lived in the U.S. for the past 20 years and currently resided in a Queens apartment with at least two roommates. It was not clear if he was Muslim or Hindi. 'I think she's crazy,' Sen's shocked roommate, Ar Suman, told the New York Post. 'I can't believe this right now.' Suman said Sen, who . was single and childless, had just opened a copy shop, the New Amsterdam . Printing Co, with another man on Manhattan’s Upper West Side.

Hunt: New York Police Department chief spokesman Paul Browne said the woman fled the scene, pictured, after the shocking attack and officers were searching for her . Investigation: Officers, pictured, quizzed witnesses after the shocking incident . According to NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly,. officers identified Sen using his wallet and laptop, both of which were recovered at the scene. The NYPD's chief . spokesman Paul Browne said Menendez fled the station after the attack. Meanwhile, Kelly has said Sen was looking . westbound as the train pulled into the station and likely didn't . see the woman leaping from a bench and shoving him at the last, possible moment before the train arrived. Sen was struck by the first car of an 11-car northbound train and got stuck under the wheels of the second car, Browne said. The NYPD chief added Sen, who was . pronounced dead at the scene, had 'terrible injuries that make providing . a description difficult at this time.' It also has not been determined if anyone tried . to help the man up before he was struck by the train. However, according to witnesses, there wouldn't have been time. 'I . heard the train screech as it was stopping and then heard this loud . scream,' Linda Santini-Tripodis, who was beneath the 40th Street station . at the time, told the newspaper. 'I'm never going to forget that scream for as long as I live.' Sen's death marks a second time this month that someone has been killed in such a gruesome fashion. However, Browne added there was 'no trend' of . such horrific occurrences. 'It's the urban nightmare,' Browne told Bloomberg. 'It's sometimes in the back of peoples' minds because of the incident preceding this one, but there's no indication that it is related in any way or inspired it,' he added. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg reportedly said during his weekly radio address Friday he understood that the extraordinary nature of the tragedy did not diminish its impact upon the victims' families. 'To say it’s only two in a long period of time doesn’t help either person,' he said. 'I don’t know what happened here.' Crime scene: The shocking incident occurred at around 8pm at the station, pictured, and is the second horrific case this month . Shocking: Sen was standing on the elevated platform of a 7 train in Queens at about 8pm when he was shoved on the tracks . Police viewed footage from a 24-hour surveillance camera outside a pizzeria located across from the station and were able to obtain clear images of the suspect, according to The New York Times. 'She jumps from the stairs and she just runs,' Oasis Restaurant owner, Giovanni Briones, told the newspaper, describing the video he provided detectives. He said he did not recognize the woman but that a restaurant regular was on the train and said they felt a bump as it ran over the man. On December 3, 58-year-old Ki-Suck Han was shoved in front of a train in Times Square. A photograph of him on the tracks a . split second before he was killed was published on the front of the New . York Post the next day, causing an uproar and debate over whether the . photographer, who had been waiting for a train, should have tried to . help him and whether the newspaper should have run the image. Apparently . no one else tried to help up Han, either. Charged: Homeless man, 30-year-old Naeem Davis, pictured, was charged with murder after pushing a man under a train on December 3 . Dead: Ki-Suck Han, pictured, was shoved in front of a train in Times Square . A homeless man, 30-year-old Naeem Davis, was charged with murder in Han's death and is being held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty, claiming Han was the aggressor and had attacked him first. The two men hadn't met before. Service was suspended tonight on the 7 train line, which connects Manhattan and Queens, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has been using buses to shuttle riders while police investigate. Being pushed onto the train tracks is a silent fear for many of the commuters who ride the city's subway a total of more than 5.2 million times on an average weekday, but deaths are rare. Among the more high-profile cases was the January 1999 death of aspiring screenwriter Kendra Webdale, who was shoved by a former mental patient. After that, the state Legislature passed Kendra's Law, which lets mental health authorities supervise patients who live outside institutions to make sure they are taking their medications and aren't threats to safety. On Friday, Mayor Bloomberg said that had some concerns about the state releasing mentally ill people from custody.

'It's a crazy resemblance,' Carlson told the Orlando Sentinel. 'Every time I watch [the movie], it's weird because it's like I'm watching myself. It's kind of creepy.' Carlson recalled not even wanting to take a photograph with the cardboard cut-out because her hair was messy. 'We had just finished a modelling job in Orlando and my mom and best friend wanted me to take a picture with the cut-out,' Carlson said. 'My hair was up and I looked like a mess, so I didn't want to at first.' Now Carlson's job has become that of a professional Disney Princess with a little bit of help from her mom. 'We never thought of this as a business,' said Karen Carlson, who manages her daughter’s schedule.

She has visited children in the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and has plans to appear at a fundraiser in Wisconsin for three cousins killed in a car crash. 'If we could only do all of them,' Anna Faith said. 'When I see the parents cry, it shows the kids are having a good time. There’s nothing that can describe their happiness.' Her fame has also allowed her family to travel together and went to a party in Dubai for the daughter of a member of a royal family.

"Shocking: Christian woman Asia Bibi, pictured,  has told of how she was given a death sentence . A  Christian woman has spoken of how she was given a death sentence in Pakistan because she drank water from a well with a cup used by Muslim women. Mother-of-five Asia Bibi, 46, has spent the last four years languishing in a prison cell after being condemned to hang following a conviction for blasphemy. She denied the charge of defiling the name of the prophet Mohammed during an argument with Muslim co-workers but was convicted following a . trial. With  97 per cent of Pakistan Muslim, hostility towards Christians is rife and the government refuses to release her because of . angry protests by extremists. Two government . officials who have spoken out on her behalf have been murdered  - . including Minister for Minorities Shahbaz Bhatti. Now, as reported by the New York Post, Mrs Bibi - a farm worker from rural Punjab -  has released a memoir called 'Blasphemy'. She describes how she has no idea how long she has left to live. Talking about how she ended up in her position, she says: 'I drank water from a well belonging to Muslim . women, using “their” cup, in the burning heat of the midday sun. 'I, Asia Bibi, have been sentenced to death because I was thirsty. I’m a . prisoner because I used the same cup as those Muslim women, because . water served by a Christian woman was regarded as unclean by my stupid . fellow fruit-pickers.' In the book, Mrs Bibi describes how she ended up in this desperate situation on June 14, 2009 after going fruit-picking in the blazing sun. Dripping with sweat as midday approached, she decided to head towards a well for a drink of water. After pulling up a bucketful of water she used an old metal cup resting on . the side of the well. But just seconds later she heard groans and noises from behind her. One of the fruit pickers - who was also . one of her neighbours - suddenly shouted that she cannot drink the water . because it is forbidden by God. Support: Ashiq Maseeh, husband of Asia Bibi, along with his daughters Sidra, second right, and Esham, left, speak to Pakistani Minister of Minority Affairs Shahbaz Bhatti, right. He was later murdered . Worried: The daughters of Mrs Bibi pose with an image of their mother . The woman shouted out, telling all of the fruit pickers that the water in the well had been dirtied because Mrs Bibi drank from their cup. After being told by the angry fruit-pickers to convert to Islam to redeem herself, Mrs Bibi decided to stand up to the crowd and defend Christianity. But after she is pushed and shoved by the group, Mrs Bibi ran home. But, five days later, while fruit . picking in another field, things became much worse. She was suddenly attacked by an angry crowd who . accused her of insulting the Prophet Mohammed. Anger: Protesters hold up placards while demanding the release of Mrs Bibi at a rally in Lahore in 2010 . She was eventually taken battered and bruised to the village imam and told she can redeem herself  only by conversion to Islam or otherwise die. She refused to convert but begged with the crowd that she did not insult their religion. They accused her of lying and repeatedly beat her until two policemen took her to a police station. That day she was thrown into a prison cell and has remained locked up ever since. Following her arrest in 2009, Mrs Bibi was held in the high-security District Jail Seikhupura, 22 miles north-west of Lahore. She has since been moved to a more remote prison. She previously told how she feared being poisoned. 'I am given raw material to cook for myself, since the administration fears I might be poisoned, as other Christians accused of blasphemy were poisoned or killed in the jail.' Her book was dictated to her husband from jail who then . relayed it to a French journalist. Half of the proceeds from the book will help support Mrs Bibi and her family in their quest for justice.","Asia Bibi, 46, has spent the last four years languishing in a prison cell .

"The Supreme Court has thrown a hitch into President Obama's new health care law by blocking a requirement that some religion-affiliated organizations provide health insurance that includes birth control. Justice Sonia Sotomayor late on Tuesday night decided to block implementation of the contraceptive coverage requirement, only hours before portions of the law would have gone into effect on New Year's Day. Her decision, which came after federal court filings by Catholic-affiliated groups from around the nation in hopes of delaying the requirements, throws a part of the president's signature law into temporary disarray. Bronx-born U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who started the countdown clock for the Times Square New Year's ball, temporarily blocked a key Obamacare provision Tuesday . At least one federal appeals court agreed with Sotomayor, issuing its own stay against part of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Sotomayor acted on a request from an organization of Catholic nuns in Denver, the Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged. Its request for an emergency stay had been denied earlier in the day by a federal appeals court. The government is 'temporarily enjoined from enforcing against applicants the contraceptive coverage requirements imposed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,' Sotomayor said in the order. Sotomayor, who was in New York on Tuesday night to lead the final 60-second countdown and push the ceremonial button to signal the descent of the Times Square New Year's Eve ball, gave government officials until 10am EST Friday to respond to her order. A decision on whether to make the temporary injunction permanent or dissolve it likely won't be made before then. 'The government has lots of ways to deliver contraceptives to people,' lawyer Mark Rienzi said. 'It doesn't need to force nuns to participate.' Under the health care law, most health insurance plans have to cover all FDA-approved contraceptives as preventive care for women. That means the coverage is provided free of charge. Churches and other houses of worship are exempt from the birth control requirement, but affiliated institutions that serve the general public are not. That includes charitable organizations, universities and hospitals. The requirement prompted an outcry from religious groups, which led the administration to try to craft a compromise. Under that compromise, insurers or health plan administrators must provide birth control coverage, and the religious institution itself is not responsible. But the administration's compromise did not satisfy some critics, who called it a fig leaf. The Supreme Court is likely to take up the birth control mandate later this year . The nuns would have to sign a form authorizing their insurance company to provide contraceptive coverage, which would still violate their beliefs, Rienzi said. 'Without an emergency injunction, Mother Provincial Loraine Marie Maguire has to decide between two courses of action: (a) sign and submit a self-certification form, thereby violating her religious beliefs; or (b) refuse to sign the form and pay ruinous fines,' Rienzi said. The White House did not comment on the order Tuesday night. The Little Sisters operate homes for the elderly poor in the United States and around the world. They were joined in their lawsuit by religious health benefit providers, Christian Brothers Services and Christian Brothers Employee Benefits Trust. Sotomayor's decision to delay the contraceptive portion of the law was joined by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which also issued an emergency stay for Catholic-affiliated groups challenging the contraceptive provision, including the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., and Catholic University. But one judge on the three-judge panel that made the decision, Judge David S. Tatel, said he would have denied their motion. 'Because I believe that appellants are unlikely to prevail on their claim that the challenged provision imposes a ''substantial burden'' under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, I would deny their application for an injunction pending appeal,' Tatel said. The archdiocese praised the appeals court's action in a statement. 'This action by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is in line with the rulings of courts all across the country which have held that the HHS mandate imposes a substantial and impermissible burden on the free exercise of religion,' the archdiocese said. 'These decisions also vindicate the pledge of the U.S. Catholic bishops to stand united in resolute defense of the first and most sacred freedom - religious liberty.' The Supreme Court already has decided to rule on whether businesses may use religious objections to escape a requirement to cover birth control for employees. That case, which involves Hobby Lobby Inc., an Oklahoma City-based arts and crafts chain with 13,000 full-time employees, is expected to be argued in March and decided by summer.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor granted temporary injunction allowing Catholic groups to not cover birth control .

"Half of cancer patients are surviving the disease, according to a major study. The numbers living for at least ten years after diagnosis – when they are counted as having beaten cancer – has doubled since the 1970s. Experts say the results are so promising that within the next 20 years, more than three quarters  of cancer patients could be living free of the disease. Success: The number of cancer patients living for at least ten years after diagnosis - when they are counted as having beaten cancer - has doubled since the 1970s . They credit earlier diagnosis as well as advances in treatments which both eliminate tumours and prevent them returning. Researchers looked at the records of 7.2million cancer patients in the UK between 1972 and 2011 and found that those diagnosed today have a 50 per cent chance of surviving for ten years, compared to the early 1970s when just a quarter of patients could expect to live that long. However, the survival chances vary hugely between different types of cancer. While 78 per cent of women with breast cancer can expect to live for a decade, only 1 per cent of those with pancreatic cancer and 5 per cent of lung cancer patients will survive this long. New research shows that people diagnosed with cancer today have a 50 per cent chance of surviving for ten years, compared to the early 1970s when just a quarter of patients could expect to live that long . Cancer Research UK credits earlier diagnosis as well as advances in treatments which both eliminate tumours and prevent them returning . Researchers are now focusing their efforts on finding new drugs for these difficult-to-treat forms of the disease, which also include brain tumours and oesophageal cancer. Around 331,000 Britons are diagnosed with cancer every year in Britain. Based on this figure, 165,500 can expect to live at least ten years. Professor Michel Coleman, head of charity Cancer Research UK’s cancer survival group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, whose team produced the survival figures, said that once a patient has survived for ten years, they theoretically have no more chance of dying from cancer than anyone else. He said: ‘As a whole, patients who have survived that long no longer have any different chances of surviving than the rest of the population. So in that sense it would represent a cure.’ Results: Experts credit earlier diagnosis as well as advances in treatments which both eliminate tumours and prevent them returning . Dr Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘We know more about cancer now than we ever did before. But we wouldn’t want to celebrate the fact that only 50 per cent of patients are now surviving their cancer. ‘We now want to go from 50 per cent to 75 per cent in a 20-year period.’ Despite advances, survival rates in Britain are only on a par with the likes of Estonia and the Czech Republic, and are stubbornly lower than France, Spain and Scandinavia. Researchers blame late diagnosis which means cancers are only picked up when they have spread and are untreatable. Many patients put off going to see their GP despite the warning signs, while doctors may also miss symptoms, especially when they can be mistaken for other conditions. Researchers do not yet know whether the Government is on course to meet its ambitious cancer strategy of saving an extra 5,000 lives a year by 2016.","In 20 years 75% of patients could be living free of the disease, say experts .

"Casino operator Las Vegas Sands has agreed to pay $47.4 million to the U.S. Attorney's Office after failing to flag millions of dollars in money transfers made by a gambler with suspected links to drug trafficking. The investigation centered on Chinese-Mexican businessman Zhenli Ye Gon, whom prosecutors describe as a high-stakes player who gambled at several major casinos, including the Venetian in Las Vegas between 2004 and 2007. In that period, Ye Gon lost more than $125 million at multiple casinos, including $84 million at the Las Vegas Sands-owned Venetian  - according to the settlement agreement filed by prosecutors. Pay-out: Las Vegas Sands has agreed to pay $47.4 million to the U.S. Attorney's Office after failing to report millions of dollars in money transfers made by a gambler with suspected  links to drug trafficking. Its hotel and casino is pictured in Las Vegas . Ye Gon's Venetian losses also included $36.5 million in credit that the casino advanced to him and that was later written off as bad debt. The settlement agreement said Ye Gon's losses were large enough to affect the bonuses of many Las Vegas Sands and Venetian executives, including some involved in compliance. His individual bets were monitored in real time and had an immediate effect on the company's earnings, it said. Investigators concluded that Las Vegas Sands failed to comply with a federal law requiring casinos report suspicious financial transactions involving customers. Prosecutors noted that Ye Gon transferred more than $45 million to the Venetian casino between 2006 and 2007, when he was the largest all-cash up-front gambler the Venetian had ever had to that point, prosecutors said. Accused: The money transfers were made by Chinese-Mexican businessman Zhenli Ye Gon, pictured . Ye Gon wire transferred money to the casino from banks and money exchange houses in Mexico. The Venetian filed a so-called suspicious activity report on Ye Gon in April 2007, but prosecutors contend that the report left out key transactions. The money Las Vegas Sands agreed to pay as part of the settlement represents the funds that were sent to the Venetian by or on behalf of Ye Gon, prosecutors noted. In March 2007, Ye Gon's Mexico City home was raided by police and officers seized $207 million in U.S. currency. The U.S. government indicted Ye Gon on narcotic charges, but the case was dismissed in 2009. He's now awaiting extradition to Mexico, where he faces drug-trafficking charges. Shares of Las Vegas Sands ended regular trading down $1.79, or 3.2 per cent, at $54.57. The stock added 25 cents in after-market trading. In a statement Tuesday, Las Vegas Sands noted its cooperation with the probe was recognised by the government. Prosecutors said that In return the Attorney's Office will not seek an indictment against the casino operator. The deal, which was finalised late on Monday, also brings the government's criminal investigation to a close. However, it requires Las Vegas Sands to boost its efforts to monitor suspicious financial transactions for the next two years. Las Vegas Sands Corp, which owns the .

"Vicar's daughter: Rowena Golton believed she had 'lost in ego' syndrome and would die a 'lonely death' A college lecturer jumped 50ft to her death from the top of a building just hours after hospital staff put her severe suicidal depression down to ‘sleep deprivation’, an inquest has heard. Rowena Golton, of Whalley Range, Manchester - who believed she had ‘lost in ego’ syndrome and would die a ‘lonely death’ - had urged her mother to take her to the euthanasia clinic Dignitas after a long-term romance had ended. Despite being referred three times for urgent treatment due to concerns about her mental health, the vicar’s daughter was sent home by a psychiatric nurse at Manchester Royal Infirmary. The nurse thought 45-year-old Miss Golton - a former prop maker for children’s TV shows including Bill and Ben and Bob the Builder - was suffering from exhaustion and advised to return for further assessment the following day. Instead she walked to the top of a mill in Stockport where she was involved in bible meetings and threw herself from the roof. Miss Golton was taken to hospital by ambulance but later died from multiple internal injuries. It later emerged that waiting lists in Manchester for long-term psychotherapy treatment spanned from at least 12 weeks to nine months, which led to Miss Golton becoming more anxious due to the lack of support she deemed necessary. Following the inquest at Stockport Coroners’ Court, Miss Golton’s parents, who live near Grenoble, France, said they hoped the death would highlight growing concerns over mental health in England. Her father, Reverend Alan Golton, 85, said: ‘Our daughter’s untimely death is obviously related to the adequacy of mental health services. ‘In our opinion mental health services are underfunded in relation to other forms of illness and they’re obviously very complicated due to the number of referrals that need to be made for treatment. ‘It’s much more difficult to assess the need to hospitalise someone who is mentally ill than someone who has had physical injury. It’s very difficult for any person to make that decision. For us Rowena’s deterioration happened so quickly. The last six months were very rapid.’ Miss Golton - described as ‘lively, gifted, extremely intelligent and highly articulate’ - had worked as a prop maker before getting a lecturing job at Manchester College teaching jewellery craft. She had battled depression over the years but her condition worsened after she broke up with a partner, and sought help last September when she was referred for more intensive treatment. But she was discharged from continued mental health services on February 24, although she remained on a long waiting list and was prescribed medication. Her mother Valerie, 73, told the hearing: ‘She was a very popular and gifted teacher. She would sometimes ring up and say “I’m lonely, mum”, even though she was a people person. ‘Over the last seven or eight years she had a number of difficulties in relation to depression. She separated from a relationship in August 2013. Treatment: Despite being referred three times for urgent treatment due to concerns about her mental health, the vicar's daughter was sent home by a psychiatric nurse at Manchester Royal Infirmary (pictured) ‘From that point onwards she became increasingly depressed and more withdrawn. It was the most depressed I had ever seen her. Her feelings got to the point where she became increasingly unable to function normally. ‘She found it difficult to go to work. There were things that she was telling me on the phone for the first time, expressing thoughts she didn’t want to live anymore.’ By January, Miss Golton had become so suicidal she went to A&E and was admitted to hospital at her own request. Mrs Golton added: ‘I understand she was told that cognitive behavioural therapy might help her but there was a five month waiting list. By February 22 I already had the impression she just wanted to emotionally distance herself in case we got in her way.’ During a two-week holiday to Marrakech, Morocco, in March this year, Miss Golton, had what she later described as a ‘meltdown’ and emailed her mother saying she wished to end her life. 'She was asked by one doctor in A&E, ""if you really wanted to commit suicide, how would you do it?"" She just grinned and said ""I’m not telling you""' Valerie Golton, mother . In the email she talked of having ‘lost in ego’ syndrome and was very quickly going to go downhill and ‘become a vegetable’. A tour guide later phoned Mrs Golton to say her daughter had been admitted to a psychiatric unit and Mrs Golton immediately booked a flight to the African country and brought her home. Mrs Golton added: ‘We got back to the UK and took her to A&E. she was calm but distant. She wanted me to promise to take her to Switzerland for euthanasia. ‘She was talking about not wanting to live anymore. She was asked by one doctor in A&E, “if you really wanted to commit suicide, how would you do it?” ‘She just grinned and said “I’m not telling you”. I got the impression she couldn’t cope with having to wait and continue in the mental mess she was in any longer.’ Miss Golton became ‘angry’ when she was told to go home at around 3.30am on April 6, but a meeting was made for the crisis team to visit her address at noon that day. But at about 10.30am Miss Golton was seen in her vehicle in the car park at the former cotton mill. Difficult time: During a two-week holiday to Marrakech (file picture), Morocco, in March this year, Miss Golton, had what she later described as a 'meltdown' and emailed her mother saying she wished to end her life . Other members of her church group due to attend a meeting went inside only to find Miss Golton lying fatally injured. She left a letter apologising to family and friends including her local pastor. Psychiatric nurse Denise Hardy, a senior mental health practitioner at Manchester Royal Infirmary, was the last medical professional to see Miss Golton when she was admitted to A&E. She said: ‘She told me she had thoughts . she might throw herself off a bridge or building and she described . having had a meltdown in Marrakech. 'She was quite angry. I felt like she was keeping it supressed but I got the impression she didn’t know what she wanted. She got angry when I said I didn’t think she was schizophrenic' Denise Hardy, psychiatric nurse . ‘She said she was schizophrenic or had dementia and we had a discussion and I felt she was exhausted. I didn’t know whether to admit her. I wanted her to be with people who cared for her and understood her. It was a difficult assessment. ‘A lot of symptoms were of exhaustion and sleep deprivation.  She described being de-personalised and having conversations in her head and if I mentioned Marrakech she got very anxious and distressed and angry. ‘She said she would grow old with dementia. Like she could see further than tomorrow. I felt exhaustion was clouding the clinical picture.’ ‘I contacted the specialist registrar for his opinion but I felt her risk of self-harm was low at the time. If she hadn’t have had the support from mum I think my decision to send her home would have been altered. ‘She was quite angry. I felt like she was keeping it supressed but I got the impression she didn’t know what she wanted. She got angry when I said I didn’t think she was schizophrenic.’ Following the tragedy a report by Dr Judith Harrison of the Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust said there were concerns about access to therapy and long waiting lists. ‘Long waiting lists are unsatisfactory but they are generally the same across the country,’ she said. ‘Waiting lists should be prioritised differently. If there is a waiting list for six to nine months I would agree there needs to be more of those services.’ Reaching a conclusion of suicide, Coroner . Joanne Kearsley said she would be writing to the appropriate health . body to discuss the levels of care available in ‘crisis teams’ and also . to waiting times involved in mental health care. 'I want to offer my condolences to her family and friends. The deterioration in mental health in those six months must have been difficult for all of you' Coroner Joanne Kearsley . Miss Kearsley added: ‘Members of the family spoke about her recurring depression. There seems no doubt that that had intensified and I heard of the involvement of the GP and mental health services. ‘There was inpatient admission and involvement with the crisis team. It appears there’s no dispute that she needed longer-term therapy and assistance. ‘While referrals have been made I have heard evidence around difficulties in accessing and waiting lists she was subject to. It is not simply a problem for Manchester alone. ‘I heard from Denise Hardy of her assessment in A&E. I am grateful for her honest evidence and the difficulties she had in assessing and I fully accept we now have the benefit of hindsight and what tragically occurred. ‘I want to offer my condolences to her family and friends. The deterioration in mental health in those six months must have been difficult for all of you.’","Rowena Golton from Manchester believed she had 'lost in ego' syndrome .

"Army chiefs who led Britain in Iraq and Afghanistan have praised Parliament for its decision not to join the U.S. in any military strikes against Syria. As America prepares for missile strikes against the war-torn country - possibly as early as tomorrow -  David Cameron is still reeling from Thursday's shock Commons defeat. But despite the anger and frustration of the British government - and many Conservative MPs - generals who led the British Army in recent campaigns said not taking action against Syrian president Bashar Assad was the correct decision. Happy:  Lord Dannatt, right, former head of the British Army, described the vote as a 'victory for common sense and democracy'.  Sir Mike Jackson , left, said he did not think relations with the U.S. would be damaged . Departure: U.N. weapons experts are pictured crossing into Lebanon today after leaving Syria earlier than expected - prompting fears an attack by the U.S. could begin tomorrow . General Lord Dannatt, former head of the British Army, described the vote as a 'victory for common sense and democracy', telling the BBC the 'drumbeat for war' had dwindled among the British public in recent days. 'The will of the people has been expressed through the House of Commons that we don't want to get involved in this - that's the right answer at this precise moment. 'President Obama may well take note of what's happened in Westminster tonight and think again - I certainly hopes he thinks again because I'm absolutely convinced the use of explosive ordinance into Damascus at the present moment will make the situation in that very difficult Syrian civil war worse, not better.' He said the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council needed to unite in bringing 'real pressure' on President Assad. Speaking to The Times, Rear Admiral Chris Parry said he had spoken to serving colleagues and they were glad at the decision made in Parliament. 'They were being asked to deliver military means without any idea of the strategic outcome desired,' he said. Strain: Prime Minister David Cameron is pictured being driven away from the rear of Number 10 Downing Street last night . He has been left humiliated following Thursday's shock Commons defeat . Snub: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry lavished praise on France last night, calling it America's 'oldest ally' as the two countries prepare for a missile strike against Syria . General Sir Mike Jackson, who was Chief of the General Staff during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, said he felt that war's legacy affected the debate. But he said he did not believe it would affect the 'Special Relationship'. Speaking to The Times, he added that he thought Mr Cameron had behaved honestly. 'He was . clearly very upset by the evidence of chemical attack, which was a . blatant breach of international law', he said. 'The majority in Parliament didn't . see it that way.' U.N. weapons inspectors today left the war-torn country earlier than expected -  fueling speculation of an imminent attack. It came as the White House delivered an astonishing snub to Britain following Thursday's shock Commons defeat, with sources saying David Cameron had 'bungled' securing British support for military action and that Britain 'cannot be counted on'. Victims of the Syrian chemical attack are pictured wrapped in white burial shrouds . Anger: Hundreds died in the chemical attacks, including many women and children . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry last night paved the way for war by saying the American intelligence community had 'high confidence' that the regime launched a chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of Damascus last week. Mr Kerry pointedly made no mention of . Britain during his speech and instead lavished praise on its ‘oldest . ally’ France - which looks likely to join the U.S in a missile strike. He paid tribute to the French for standing ready to join the U.S in confronting the ‘thug and murderer’ President Bashar Assad. He also praised Australia and even Turkey for their support. In . a passionate speech in Washington, he urged the world to act as he . warned 'history would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a . blind eye to a dictator'. President Barack Obama . yesterday said he . is weighing ‘limited and narrow’ action as the administration put the . chemical weapons death toll at 1,429 people - far more than previous . estimates - . including more than 400 children.","General Lord Dannatt described vote as 'victory for common sense'

"Thieves ransacked a house that features on the gun map published by the Journal News, just days after another home on the list was also targeted.

The criminals escaped with two handguns, two pistol permits, cash, savings bonds and jewelry. The firearms were in the stolen safe. Deliberately targeted? Burglars stole two handguns at a second home that featured on the controversial gun map published in December . Burglars also broke into a house in White Plains, New York, on Saturday and headed straight for the gun safe. The thieves struck at this house just . three weeks after the names and addresses of legal firearms permit . holders were published on the controversial gun map published by the . Journal News. The paper caused a stir on December 23 when it listed thousands of permit holders in suburban Westchester and Rockland counties just . north of New York City in an interactive map. The break-in at Britta Lane, New City, was reported at 9.45 pm on Wednesday evening. Clarkstown Police stated that they currently have no evidence of a link between the burglary and the gun map. Police believe that the break-in was a 'random crime' but others aren't so sure . Clarkstown Sgt. Joanne Fratianni said in a statement reported by Newsday.com: . 'The burglary is still under investigation, and there are no facts to . support this correlation at this time. If the investigation develops . further information, it will be released accordingly.' The . thieves broke into two safes on the home's third floor and removed a . third safe from the basement, that contained a .45 caliber Colt and a . .22 caliber Iver Johnson. They . also stole pistol permits from Rockland and Orange counties, and other . valuables. The home owners have refused to comment publicly. While police believe this was a 'random crime', others are not so sure, and many are speculating that . the map is now being used by criminals for targeted gun theft . This home in White Plains, New York, is also listed on the controversial gun map and was broken into on Saturday . During the burglary in White Plains at the weekend, the thieves headed for the safe where the homeowner, a man in his 70s, stores his legally owned guns according to Newsday. The intruders abandoned their attempts when they couldn't crack the safe, and police confirmed that one suspect has been taken into custody. The home owner also declined to comment in this case but a New York state senator blasted the gun map after this incident. Republican Senator Greg Ball has . proposed legislation that restricts gun permit information to law . enforcement authorities and he strongly criticized the Journal News. 'No comment': The White Plains homeowner told News12 he had nothing to add while police continued investigations into the burglary . 'It is reported that the burglar used the Journal News’ interactive gun map to target a home included on the map,' Ball said. 'The Journal News has placed the lives of these folks at risk by creating a virtual shopping list for criminals and nut jobs. 'If . the connection is proven, this is further proof that these maps are not . only an invasion of privacy but that they present a clear and present . danger to law-abiding, private citizens. 'Former . convicts have already testified to the usefulness of the asinine . Journal News ‘gun maps’ yet the reckless editors are evidently willing . to roll the dice, gambling with the lives of innocent local homeowners,' the senator continued. 'Criminal's shopping list?' Both homes  are featured on the map that lists the names and addresses of legal gun owners . The New York newspaper reportedly hired a team of armed guards to patrol the paper's headquarters in West Nyack after publishing the names and addresses of nearby . gun permit owners. The Rockland County Times . reported that Journal News editor Caryn A. McBride hired gun-toting . security guards to guard the paper's offices amid a flurry of angry . emails and phone calls in the following days. Along with an article entitled 'The . gun owner next door: What you don't know about the weapons in your . neighborhood,' the Journal News map was compiled in response to the December 14 . shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut, . editors of the Gannett Corp.-owned newspaper said. The publication prompted outrage, particularly on social media sites, among gun owners. 'Do you fools realize that you also . made a map for criminals to use to find homes to rob that have no guns . in them to protect themselves?' Rob Seubert of Silver Spring, Maryland, . posted on the newspaper's web site. 'What a bunch of liberal boobs you . all are.' 'Reckless': A New York State Senator blasted the Journal News for their controversial gun map . The newspaper's editor and vice . president of news, CynDee Royle, defended the . decision to list the permit holders. 'We knew publication of the database . would be controversial, but we felt sharing as much information as we . could about gun ownership in our area was important in the aftermath of . the Newtown shootings,' she said. Some critics retaliated by posting reporters' and editors' addresses and other personal information online. Howard Good, a journalism professor . at the State University of New York at New Paltz, called the critics' response childish and petulant. 'It . doesn't move the issue of gun . control to the level of intelligent public discussion,' he said. 'Instead, it transforms what should be a rational public debate on a . contentious issue into ugly gutter fighting.' Calling for change: The paper said that they produced the map because in the wake of the Newtown shooting many people wanted to know who had legal guns in their neighborhood, and there were protests across the country (pictured). Good said the information about permit holders was public and, if presented in context, served a legitimate interest. But media critic Al Tompkins of the . Florida-based Poynter Institute wrote online this week that the . newspaper's reporting had not gone far enough to justify the permit . holders' loss of privacy. 'If journalists could show flaws in . the gun permitting system, that would be newsworthy,' he said. 'Or, for . example, if gun owners were exempted from permits because of political . connections, then journalists could better justify the privacy . invasion.' Tompkins said he feared the dispute might prompt lawmakers to play to privacy fears. 'The net effect of the abuse of public . records from all sides may well be a public distaste for opening . records, which would be the biggest mistake of all,' he said.","Two addresses that appear on map of legally owned guns published by Journal News on December 23 have been burglarized in last week .

"A streaker sparked a mass brawl after running on to the pitch at a rugby match to tackle an opposition player. The match between Newcastle University and Northumbria was coming to an end when the man, whose identity is not known, wandered on to the pitch with no clothes on. After lining himself up to catch the ball for Northumbria, he tackled a Newcastle player to the ground to rapturous applause at Kingston Park. Scroll down for video . The naked man ran onto the pitch at Kingston Park as the match between Newcastle University and Northumbria came to an end . After lining himself up with Northumbria, the prankster made a tackle towards an opposition player . But within seconds players from opposing teams started fighting, leaving the streaker able to make a quick exit without getting caught up in the scuffle. Tongan international rugby player Willis Koloofai said: 'I’ve played a lot of rugby, but I’ve never seen anything like this before. 'The guy had so much time on the pitch, about 4 minutes to do what he wanted! 'The atmosphere was pretty good in the stadium as you’d expect between two rival universities, but when he ran on, it got even more charged - it was so entertaining. 'He lined up as if he belonged there as Northumbria’s 16th man, crouched down on his knees. Then as the ball came near him, he executed a textbook tackle on the Newcastle kid! As the two teams fall into a pitch-side scuffle, the prankster makes a quick exit before coming to any harm . The practical joke was filmed by a spectator who said he had never seen anything like it before . 'Then there was just a massive rumble between the two teams - Newcastle were probably a bit annoyed at the extra defence that Northumbria suddenly had! 'I was watching it with some of the Falcons boys and we found it hilarious - we had no idea where the security was though.' Eventually, play was resumed, with Northumbria running out 29-10 winners to continue their good form over their arch rivals.","Streaker interrupted match between Newcastle University and Northumbria .

"This astonishing new photograph shows legendary American gunman Billy the Kid, a historian has claimed. The man on the right of this picture - taken around 1879 -  is believed to be the Wild West gunslinger. The picture is now generating huge excitement because, if authenticated, it would be only the second known image of the notorious outlaw. The other fetched more than $2million at . auction. Rare: This astonishing new photograph shows legendary American gunman Billy the Kid, a historian has claimed. The famous outlaw is pictured, right, with his friend Dan Dedrick left . The image, as reported by the Las Cruces Sun News, was released by New Mexico historian Frank Parrish. He claims to have extensively researched the picture to back up his claim that it is Billy the Kid. A large part of this involved identifying the man on the left, who he claims is Dan Dedrick -  a close friend of the outlaw. Speaking to the Albuquerque Journal, . Mr Parrish said: 'Identification of Dedrick is the ""clincher"" in this . image, elevating a near-certain image to a clearly and obvious picture . of the Kid. Pricey: This picture of Billy the Kid was sold for $2million at auction to billionaire William Koch . 'It’s finally a good image of the Kid . that reveals a young man as people who remembered him described him – . not as the famous bucktoothed Billy we know so well.' It is thought the picture was taken when the gunslinger was 20 - two years before he was killed. Mr Parrish admitted that some people will be skeptical of the picture. But he is absolutely certain that it shows Billy the Kid. 'It’s Billy,' he said. The only only surviving authentic photograph of the outlaw was expected to make $400,000 at an auction in 2011. But billionaire William Koch ended up paying more than $2million for it. The photograph - a tintype owned . by Dedrick's family for years - shows Billy the Kid packing a Colt . revolver and trademark 1873 Winchester carbine rifle. After . its purchase, the 71-year-old told the Denver Post: 'I love the Old . West. I plan on enjoying it and discreetly sharing it. 'I think I'll . display it in a few small museums.' The . photo was taken outside a saloon in Fort Sumner, New Mexico, when Billy . the Kid, born William Henry McCarty and later known as outlaw William . Bonney, was barely out of his teens. Experts estimate it was taken around 1879. But 132 years later, it endures as the most recognisable photo of the American West. It was only expected to fetch between . $300,000 and $400,000, but the price climbed dramatically in just two . minutes after Mr Koch began bidding. The . Kid gave the photograph to his friend, Dan Dedrick, and it's been kept . in the family for the last century, going on public display only once at . Lincoln County Museum in New Mexico in 1986 to 1998. It . was famously featured in a book by Pat Garrett, the sheriff who gunned . Billy down on July 14, 1881 - 130 years ago next month. Billy the Kid was a notorious 19th-century American gunman who was celebrated for his skill with guns. According to popular legend he killed 21 men, however,  it is generally believed that this figure is more likely to be between four and nine. He is thought to have been 17 when he killed his first man in 1877 - although some historians say he could have been as young as 15. Notorious: This image from the 1973 film 'Pat Garatt and Billy the Kid' starred Kris Kristofferson as the outlaw and Richard Jaeckel as a sheriff . He was friendly and personable and a smart dresser, often wearing a Mexican sombrero. These qualities contributed to his image as both a notorious outlaw and a folk hero. He was catapulted into legend in 1881 when New Mexico's governor, Lew Wallace, placed a price on his head. This prompted newspapers to carry stories about his exploits. It has been claimed that Billy the Kid was shot dead by Sheriff Pat Garrett in 1881 despite being promised clemency for testifying in a murder case. He was killed a few months after escaping from jail.","New Mexico historian Frank Parrish is certain picture shows gunman .

"A woman who admitting allowing her five-month-old daughter to be raped by a man she met online was handed down two consecutive life sentences without probation today. Tessa L. Vanvlerah, 22, from St Louis, was charged with first-degree statutory rape and sodomy, as well as incest and child pornography. Her attorneys failed to convince a judge that she should get probation because she suffers from a psychological disorder. Jailed: Mother Tessa Vanvlerah, right, allowed Kenneth Kyle, left, to rape her five-month-old daughter on several different occasions . Home: Tessa Vanvlerah, of the 200 block of Solon Drive in Ballwin, pictured, would invite Kyle to the home to have sex with her daughter when she was five-months-old . Dr Brooke Kraushaar said a dependent-personality disorder caused Vanvlerah to participate in the sexual fantasies of Kenneth M. Kyle, 49, a college professor from California, even though she knew sex acts involving her then-five-month-old daughter were wrong. Kyle was sentenced to 37-and-a-half years in prison in March after pleading guilty of abusing the infant during several occasions in 2009, according to St Louis Today. Along with hundreds of child porn images on Kyle's computers, investigators found information that led them to the St Louis area, where Kyle had visited Vanvlerah four times in five months since meeting online. During those visits, prosecutors say the pair had sex with the girl and each other at various hotels. Dr Kraushaar also told the court that the 22-year-old was so afraid of being rejected by others that she also allowed Kyle to choke, burn and urinate on her. Adoptive mother of victim, now three . But prosecutors said Vanvlerah exercised free will when she started communicating online with Kyle and sharing child pornography. She also carved his name into her arm at his request but refused when he suggested bestiality. They also said she spoke with another man who sent her child pornography and invited him to also come and have sex with her infant daughter. Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Kathi Alizadeh also pointed out that Vanvlerah willingly posed for pictures with Kyle and her daughter. St Louis today also reported that a woman obtained an order of protection in 2008 against Vanvlerah, then 18, accusing her of seducing and having sex with the woman's 16-year-old autistic son. The autistic boy is believed to be the father of the infant in the case. The infant, who is now three years old, was placed with a foster mother who has since adopted her. She read out a victim's impact statement saying the child would scream when anyone bathed her or changed her diaper. Even now she has night terrors and asks every night to make sure no one comes into the home. The woman, in tears, said the girl was getting better day by day now that she 'is no longer Tessa's plaything and she is no longer Tessa's child'.","Tessa L.

"Several Obamacare exchanges in states that didn't participate in the healthcare.gov fiasco are now having so much trouble with their own health insurance websites that they're withholding payments to their biggest IT contractor – and it's the same company that botched the federal government's insurance portal. CGI Group, the Montreal company behind the White House's error-prone, $677 million online white elephant, is under fire in Massachusetts, Vermont and Hawaii after those states' Affordable Care Act websites suffered from some of the same problems that first made Obamacare a late-night punchline in October. The Commonwealth Health Connector has paid just $11 million to CGI for the Massachusetts project, although the website contract carried a $69 price tag, according to Fox News. A Massachusetts government official who requested anonymity told MailOnline that his state was 'just one of the governments that got substandard, messed-up results' from the contractors it chose. 'If we could do it all over again,' the official said, 'we would have been better off hiring a half-dozen undergrads at MIT.' During his end-of-year press conference, President Obama blamed some of his administration's health care website woes on the rules that govern how IT work is contracted . Commonwealth Health Connector in Massachusetts is out tens of millions as its uers continue to struggle with a faulty website . Coral Andrews, executive director of the Hawaii Health Connector, resigned on Dec. 6 because her state's Obamacare website was weeks late and registered hundreds -- instead of tens of thousands -- of new insurance customers . Spokesman Jason Lefferts told The Boston Globe that 'CGI has consistently underperformed, which is frustrating and a serious concern.' 'We are holding the vendor accountable for its underperformance and will continue to apply nonstop pressure to work to fix defects and improve performance.' The state's officials will hold a January 9 meeting to determine how to proceed, but they're not pleased with the progress so far. Vermont Health Connect, saddled with an $89 million contract on a website that wouldn't reliably let taxpayers enroll in coverage until early December, has held back $5.1 million of the $11 million CGI has billed to date, and is challenging other invoices totaling more than another $1 million. 'I've lost confidence in the contractors that were supposed to deliver a fully functioning website on Oct. 1,' Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin told the Globe. 'I'm going to continue to hold their feet to the fire until they get it right.' Typical: Kathleen Sebelius (R), the secretary of Health and Human Services and the White House's chief Obamacare cheerleader, was left ashen-faced during a November photo-op when volunteers couldn't use healthcare.gov . Vermont Health Connect has performed so poorly that the state is withholding at least $6.1 million from CGI Global's U.S. arm . Hawaii, Colorado, Kentucky, New Mexico, and California all used CGI as their principal Obamacare website contractor, and some have fared better than others. Still sick: As the year's final Obamacare enrollment deadline arrived this week, the Web portal still wasn't performing as advertised . California has been a rare bright spot in President Obama's plan to replace the nation's medical insurance system with government-brokered insurance marketplaces. But Hawaii's opened two weeks later than promised, and has performed so poorly that its executive director resigned on December 6. CGI Global's U.S. arm also has a $93.7 million contract with the federal government, but a Health and Human Services official told MailOnline that the amount of its billings would not be made public. Overall, Uncle Same has paid out $319 million to the contractors responsible for building healthcare.gov, a yet-to-be-completed project that Silicon Valley experts have told reporters should have cost no more than $10 million to bring online. President Obama said during a Dec. 20 press conference that the federal government's contracting rules were partly responsible for the debacle. 'Part of it, as I've said before, had to do with how IT procurement generally is done,' he said. A month earlier, Obama told a group of Wall Street CEOs that 'the way the federal government does procurement and does IT is just generally not very efficient.' 'In fact, there's probably no bigger gap between the private sector and the public sector,' he lamented.","'If we could do it all over again,' a Massachusetts official said, 'we would have been better off hiring a half-dozen undergrads at MIT'

The growing economies of Brazil, China and India could all be . vulnerable as the U.S. Federal Reserve looks to reduce its support for the U.S. economy this month. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has now recommended that policy makers should be ready to handle a rise in financial . instability. Worrying: Countries with emerging economies - such as Brazil, pictured - are at risk of of slowing down because of tighter U.S. monetary policy, it has been claimed . It warned that advanced economies led by the United States will increasingly drive global growth . In a surveillance note obtained by Reuters and prepared for the G20 meeting in St. Petersburg, the IMF urged strengthened global action to revitalise growth and better manage risks, warning that some downside risks have become more prominent. Emerging economies are seen particularly as being vulnerable to a tightening of U.S. monetary policy and the IMF recommended that policy makers be ready to handle a rise in financial instability. 'Policy makers should allow exchange rates to respond to changing fundamentals but may need to guard against risks of disorderly adjustment, including through intervention to smooth excessive volatility,' the IMF said. The U.S. Federal Reserve may start tapering its stimulus programme as early as this month, the IMF noted. 'The greatest worry may well be a prolonged period of sluggish global growth (a plausible downside),' the IMF said, adding it was revising downwards its near-term projections for emerging economies. Way forward: Advanced economies led by the United States will increasingly drive global growth, the IMF has said. This is a file picture of Times Square in New York . But with the United States and other advanced economies picking up speed, the IMF said it still expected global growth to accelerate in 2014 from this year, helped by the highly accommodative monetary conditions in the rich world. Private demand, underpinned by recovering labour and housing markets, should further bolster the U.S. economy next year, though growth in Japan may become more subdued as a consumption tax increase takes effect and stimulus spending slows. The IMF said it expected a continued recovery in the euro zone in the third quarter but said the 17-nation currency area needed to boost the supply of credit by repairing its banks' balance sheets and making progress towards a banking union. The euro zone's economy expanded 0.3 per cent in the second quarter on the back of stronger exports and a return to spending by households and governments, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat said today. To help reduce global economic imbalances, the IMF urged surplus economies such as China and Germany to stoke domestic demand while deficit countries such as the euro area periphery and Britain should improve their external competitiveness.

"Worrying: Andrew Peat, pictured, and Amy Willett, sent sexually explicit messages to a 15-year-old girl on a social networking site in an attempt to meet up with her and have sex . A couple sent sexually explicit messages to a 15-year-old girl on a social networking site in an attempt to meet up with her and have sex. Andrew Peat, 27, and his girlfriend Amy Willett, 22, sent messages to the girl by email, phone and on the social networking site. Many of the messages were sexually explicit, and included plans to meet the victim and entice her into sex. But after the teenage girl’s mother found out, she contacted the police who arrested the couple. Peat of, Hyde, Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to causing a child to engage in sexual activity, causing a child to watch a sexual act and nine counts of making indecent images. At Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court today he was sentenced to two years in prison. Amy Willett of Cheadle Hulme pleaded guilty to causing a child to engage in sexual activity, and was sentenced to 12 months in prison suspended for two years. In June 2012, Peat approached the victim, from the West Midlands, on the social networking site. She had stated her age clearly on her profile page. Within minutes of the conversation, Peat’s messages were of a sexually explicit nature, and he also stated that he and his then girlfriend were willing to meet her. A few days later Willett herself was in contact with the girl, and contact between all three took place. During their contact, Peat also sent images of a sexual nature to the victim. After Peat’s arrest, nine indecent images of children were found on his home computer. Convicted: The couple were sentenced today at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court, pictured . Detective Constable Phil Kennedy said: 'Both defendants knew they were in touch with a 15-year-old girl, but that did not stop them from their campaign of online grooming. 'The discovery of nine indecent images at Peat’s house illustrates that he had no issues with child sex offending. Indecent images of this nature endorse the abuse of children. 'Today’s outcome illustrates that Greater Manchester Police, working closely with partner agencies such as the Child Exploitation Online Protection Centre (CEOP), is committed to tackling the issue of online abuse.'","Andrew Peat and Amy .

"A little boy who had his eyes gouged out in a sickening attack has undergone surgery that could one day lead to the partial restoration of his sight. In the first of two operations, Guo Bin was fitted with implants similar to eyeballs by Dr Dennis Lam in the Southern China city of Shenzhen yesterday. Dr Lam had volunteered his services after the six-year-old had been found with his eyes gouged out and covered in blood in Fenxi, Shangxi province, on 24 August. Scroll down for video . Hope: Guo Bin has undergone surgery that could one day lead to the partial restoration of his eyesight . Preparation: A doctor examines Guo ahead of the first of the operations that could help restore his sight . Expert: Dr Dennis Lam volunteered to conduct the operations on the six-year-old free of charge . Police suspect his late aunt Zhang Huiying, who later committed suicide by throwing herself down the village well, was responsible. The boy's DNA and blood were found on her clothes. Once he has recovered from this first operation, Dr Lam will fit prosthetic eyes to Guo, which will be connected . to tissue and muscle allowing them to move. A spokeswoman for Dr Lam told the Agence-France Presse news agency this had been done to give volume to the eyes in order to fit an eye shell. Then sensory devices that generate electronic signals could be fitted that would help him to identify shapes. Dr . Lam hopes Guo Bin will benefit from the further development of electronic eye technology, although this is something that is five to 10 years in the future. According to the BBC, Dr Lam, who is based in Hong Kong, said: 'We don't know if this will be successful in the . end, but if there is this possibility, then why should we not give a . chance to little Bin-Bin?' Implants: Guo Bin is accompanied by his mother Wang Wenli before undertaking the surgery . Guo Bin recuperates with his mother following the attack in the rural area of Linfen city that left him blind . Initial reports had said the corneas . were missing when the boy's eyes were found, leading to speculation that his attacker was an organ trafficker, but police later ruled out organ . sales as a motive saying the corneas had been found attached to the . eyeballs. Police had offered a 100,000 yuan . ($16,000) reward for information leading to the arrest of the sole . suspect. Reports said the little boy had been drugged before his . eyeballs were gouged out. The brutal attack on the boy -- who has a cleft palate -- shocked Internet users in China, who demanded retribution. Guo's attack has triggered an outpouring of support within China, as well as frustration that his assailant has not been found. Horrific: The Chinese boy lies in hospital after he had his eyes gouged out . China Daily reported that donations had been flowing in since reports about the boy hit the . headlines late last month, and Guo Zhiping said the amount has reached . 800,000 yuan (£83,686). The . suicide of Guo Bin's aunt sparked public suspicion that . she might be the assailant, but the boy's father, Guo Zhiping, said it was impossible . because the two families are on good terms. A . vice-president of a school for blind children in Taiyuan, surnamed Li, . said that the school would accept Guo Bin and exempt his tuition fees if . he wants to attend it. His family found him covered in blood and . crying in pain three to four hours after the attack in a rural area of Linfen city in Shanxi province. The Beijing Times newspaper quoted the parents of the boy, whose family name is Guo according to police, as saying that their son had told them he was walking along a path when he was grabbed by a woman. She used an unspecified tool to gouge out his eyes, they said. An entire eye cannot be transplanted, but a cornea could be vital for a patient with faltering vision. Recovering: The youngster was playing alone outside his home in Linfen, Shanxi Province, when he was snatched on Monday evening . Mortified: Relatives of the youngster talk to a nurse. His parents realised he was missing when they tried to call hm inside the house but received no response . Guo Bin's devastated father said: ‘We didn’t notice his eyes were gone when we . discovered him – he had blood all over his face. We thought he had . fallen down and smashed his face.’ The . boy was rushed to hospital where doctors were shocked to find his eyes . had been removed. His father said: ‘His eyelids were turned inside out, . and his eyeballs were not there.’ Guo Bin was shown . on state TV being taken in bandages from an operating theatre to a . hospital bed, writhing in agony as his shocked family wept.

His parents discovered he was missing when they called for him to come in around 8pm on Monday but received no response. After . a frantic search with relatives, they found him screaming in a field . near their home in Fenxi, north China.

"Slimy: An enormous infestation of millipedes could have caused a crash between two trains in Western Australia. This is a file picture of a black Portuguese millipede . An enormous infestation of millipedes could have caused a crash between  two trains in Western Australia. The crash happened when a train arriving into a station at Clarkson, 25 miles . north of Perth, slammed into a stationary one. It resulted in six passengers being treated for stiff . necks following the crash on Tuesday. But it has since emerged that the crash could have happened after hundreds of Black Portuguese millipedes were found squashed in a slippery mess on the track. 'Millipedes are one of the factors we are going to take into account,' David Hynes, spokesman at the Public Transport Authority of Western Australia, said. 'What happened in previous instances is trains which were travelling at speed have gone over an infestation, crushed them and made the tracks slimy. 'The train loses traction and the train has slipped.' Hynes said. The millipedes are attracted to moist environments and are seen as invasive pests at high population levels. In 2009, thousands of them overran 1.2 miles of track, causing train delays and cancellations near Melbourne in southeast Australia. The black Portuguese millipede is native to Portugal and was accidentally introduced into Australia where it has since become an invasive pest. The millipede has flourished in Australia because of a lack of natural predators. They are most often seen in moist conditions, which creates lots of food. They have also been  known to enter homes. Huge numbers of millipedes were crushed crossing the railway tracks at Tallarook, central Victoria in March 2009, causing train cancellations due to the disturbance of signalling equipment.","A train arriving into a station near Perth crashed into stationary one .

"Breathe out: How the mobile phone breathalyser is going to work . Scroll down for video . Imagine blowing into your mobile phone to check whether you have cancer. That might sound fanciful – and even scary – but scientists at a British firm say they are now just two years away from making it happen. The inventors, at Cambridge University spin-off company Owlstone, have already created a desktop ‘disease breathalyser’ which is proven to work. Now they are miniaturising their technology further, to create a small add-on device that simply slots into the base of a mobile. Owlstone co-founder Billy Boyle says: ‘To make a standalone hand-held device, or a module that attaches to a mobile phone, is as little as two years away. It’s just a question of getting the investment.’ The firm – set up a decade ago by three engineering graduates – started out making machines to help oil firms detect contamination, and US anti-terror agencies pick up traces of explosives. But 18 months ago Belfast-born Boyle decided to take the firm into the medical arena after his girlfriend Kate, the mother of their four-year-old twins Oscar and Isaac, was diagnosed with colon cancer. She was only 34 at the time. ‘Kate was taken into hospital with stomach pains,’ Boyle says. ‘That day, she had emergency surgery. We then found out she had Stage 4 colon cancer.’ He read up on statistics for the disease, which hits 40,000 people in Britain every year, and was shocked by how much early detection determines survival – and how hard diagnosis can be. ‘If it’s detected at Stage 1, the chances of survival are 90 per cent,’ says Boyle, 35. ‘At Stage 4, it drops to six per cent.’ The couple married a year ago – Kate is currently undergoing more chemotherapy – and Boyle began looking at how Owlstone’s know-how could identify diseases earlier. At the heart of the technology is a fingernail-size microchip that can be programmed to ‘smell’ whatever chemical is of interest. It can pick up chemicals at incredibly low levels – at parts-per-trillion concentrations. This makes it ideal for detecting what Boyle calls the ‘telltale chemical fingerprints of disease’. These ‘markers’ can be exhaled in breath, or passed in urine or faeces.  Over the past year, Owlstone’s desktop ‘Lonestar’ device – which looks like a chunky iPad with a breathalyser tube – has been tested on a number of different markers for disease. Slightly larger: A standard police breathalyser used to detect alcohol levels . Researchers at Warwick University used it to discriminate between healthy people, those with the bowel condition colitis, and those with colon cancer. Rather than breath, they have been  checking for certain smelly chemicals in urine vapour. The trial has been a success. Boyle adds: ‘With colon cancer, markers are generated at the very early stages.’ That raises the possibility of replacing the NHS ‘faecal occult blood test’ – which relies on people collecting stool samples and sending them off in the post. ‘People don’t like doing the test and it’s not very accurate,’ notes Boyle, who will be speaking at the WIRED Health summit in London on Tuesday. The current test throws up too many false alarms, meaning that many people have colonoscopies to check for tumours or polyps, when none exists. This procedure, which involves a metal tube being inserted up the anal passage, carries a small risk of serious complications and is also expensive. ‘The hope is our technology will give us a screening tool that has better diagnostic accuracy, so fewer people will be sent for unnecessary colonoscopies,’ says Boyle. Tests on urine will probably stay in the consulting room. But it’s possible we will be using mobile breathalysers to check for other deadly diseases, such as lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. Owlstone has just won NHS funding to test if its technology can detect lung cancer by ‘smelling’ patients’ breath. And last month, US researchers suggested their own ‘electronic nose’ was as good as mammography at detecting breast cancer. Liver disease and kidney failure are other areas being looked at. But do people want their mobiles to detect a killer disease? Shouldn’t that information always come from a doctor? Boyle admits the best place to receive such news may always be the doctor’s. Nonetheless, he says: ‘I think in the future people will want more information about their own health. And there are lots of diseases where early detection matters.’ Billy Boyle will be speaking at the WIRED Health summit at 30 Euston Square, London,  on Tuesday, April 29.","British inventors 'two years away' from developing mobile breathalyzer .

"The US State Department has accused ISIS of taking screen grabs of Hungarian pornography and claiming the images show the rape of Arab women by western soldiers. The original image was tweeted from an account claiming allegiance with the terrorist group. The tweet features three images, one of a distressed, small child. The second features a woman being held by men in military fatigues and the final image shows a man in Arab dress being abused by a soldier. The ISIS tweet had a very graphic image which it claimed showed the abuse of a woman in Syria . The US State Department countered the tweet claiming the image came from a Hungarian porn movie . ISIS uses social media heavily in a bid to recruit new recruits from Europe and north America . In the tweet, ISIS claims that they are the 'sole saviour of millions of Sunni Muslims against Iraqi-Syria army butchers'. In response to the ISIS tweet, the US State Department using their Think Again Turn Away social media account, said the middle rape image was taken from Hungarian porn. The tweet claims that ISIS should 'stop using fake photos to trick people' into supporting their 'lost cause'. According to the State Department, the role of their anti-terrorist social media accounts is to 'expose the facts about terrorists and their propaganda.' The Think Again Turn Away account as more than 13,000 followers and has made almost 3,000 tweets. It has also released some graphic videos to counter the recruitment videos produced on behalf of ISIS to encourage western Muslims to travel to Iraq and Syria. In one video, the US State Department claims that ISIS terrorists crucify fellow Muslims, attack mosques with suicide bombs and that travel is cheap as a would-be ISIS terrorist only requires a one-way ticket. The US State Department has claimed that almost 1,500 Syrian civilians have been executed by ISIS over the past five months since they had declared their caliphate.","The US State Department is actively countering ISIS propaganda online .

"A Pennsylvania doctor accused of poisoning his wife had more than $30,000 stashed in a safe when he was arrested, it emerged this week. University of Pittsburgh medical researcher Robert Ferrante, 65, faces one count of homicide in the April death of his wife, Autumn Klein, and a search warrant application unsealed Monday has provided new details about the fascinating case. The Allegheny County district attorney's office sought in September to obtain three items - a black iPhone, a set of keys and a Florida driver's license - seized by police when Ferrante was stopped on Interstate 77 near Beckley in July. The keys opened a safety deposit box that contained $30,000, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. In the dock: Dr Robert Ferrante, left, is accused of poisoning his wife Autumn Klein, right, with cyanide . Klein, cheif of women's neurology at University of Pittsburgh medical center, collapsed in the couple's Oakland home on April 17 and died in UPMC Presbyterian three days later. Detective . Lyle Graber said that the driver's license, obtained by Ferrante, could . provide investigators with information 'necessary to indicate . Ferrante's intention of permanently changing his residency from . Pennsylvania to Florida prior to his arrest.' Investigators . previously said that Ferrante obtained two safety deposit boxes in the . weeks after his wife's death. The one containing the $30,000 listed his . adult daughter from another marriage as an owner. Included . with the warrant application unsealed Monday was a nine-page report . from the West Virginia State Police that listed additional items they . found when they stopped Ferrante, including cash, a silver trinket with a . clover leaf, several debit or credit cards and Klein's dental insurance . card. In July, before a gag order was placed on the case, Ferrante insisted he will prove he didn't poison his neurologist wife with cyanide. Blood tests revealed a lethal level . of cyanide, but only after Klein had died and been cremated at her . husband's insistence, police said. Following a court hearing in West Virginia in July, Ferrante's lawyer, William Difenderfer, said his client intends to prove his innocence. Speaking to ABC News, Mr Difenderfer, said: 'He's anxious to defend himself, have . his day in court and prove his . innocence, which I'm quite confident we'll be able to do.' Tragic: Autumn Klein was the chief of women's neurology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and died on April 20 after suddenly falling ill . Authorities allege that Ferrante, co-director of the Center for ALS Research and a visiting . professor of neurological surgery at the University of Pittsburgh used a university credit card to buy more than a half-pound of cyanide two days before his wife became ill. A witness claims Ferrante asked for help buying 'the best and purest cyanide he could get.' They . say he added it to an energy supplement that he gave to her hours after . they exchanged text messages about how the supplement could help them . conceive a child. While . the criminal complaint in the case indicates that Klein may have been . trying to get pregnant, authorities allege that Ferrante also suspected . that she was having an affair. Detectives say they've found evidence . Ferrante confronted his wife about the suspected affair three times in . the weeks leading to her death. Klein is believed to have told a male friend in February that she planned to leave her husband. Mr Difenderfer previously said his . client wasn't trying to flee charges when he . left Florida and began driving north before his arrest last week. He said he had called his client and . told him to return to Pittsburgh to surrender, and his client was 'on . his way to turn himself in.' Ferrante is a leading researcher on Lou . Gehrig's disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which . attacks nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control the . muscles, eventually leading to death. The couple met while she was a student and he worked at the VA hospital in Bedford, Massachusetts. They were married in 2001.","Dr. Robert Ferrante has been charged with killing Autumn Klein .

"This is the emotional moment a 13-year-old boy who was missing for four years was reunited with his mother after being found imprisoned behind a false wall in the linen closet of his father's home. The unnamed teenager reportedly downloaded a cellphone app to text his Florida-based mother to tell her he was being held captive and beaten at the house in Clayton County, Georgia. Police arrived at the scene and found the boy hidden behind a false panel in a linen closet in the property's garage. He repeatedly thanked officers for rescuing him, according to reports. In heart-wrenching scenes on Saturday morning, the victim was pictured clinging on to his weeping mother, who had traveled to Georgia, as another female relative sobbed uncontrollably nearby.

The boy was reported missing to child welfare authorities in 2010 after he went to visit his father and he refused to return him to his mother, according to WSB-TV. However, his mother never contacted the police, potentially because she is an immigrant and was unfamiliar with the system, it is said. But after receiving her son's text, she immediately called 911. Following her call, officers arrived at the property at 2am on Saturday. They reportedly questioned the house's uncooperative occupants for several minutes before locating the victim. It is unknown what condition the teenager was discovered in, or whether he was taken to hospital. Sargent Joanne Southerland, of Clayton County Police Department, told the news station: 'We came here to the home and were able to get inside and talk to the people inside. 'After several minutes of denying that the child was here and that there was ever any assault or anything like that, we were able to find him in the linen closet.'

"Holidaymakers were left stunned and outraged when armed police officers and soldiers raided a picturesque beach in Thailand – to seize their personal parasols and sunloungers. The overly dramatic episode played out Phuket amid growing confusion over the rules on beaches where tourists soak up the sun and play in crystal clear waters. Despite protests from upset tourists, authorities forcefully removed their umbrellas, chairs and cushions at Surin Beach, even though the objects aren’t banned under existing laws. Thai police officers and soldiers seized tourists' parasols and loungers at Surin Beach in Phuket . Despite protests from upset tourists, authorities forcefully removed their belongings from the beach . Some holidaymakers argued and stubbornly refused to take down their umbrellas while others threw their parasols in the sand in front of officials, according to The Phuket News. Beach vendors cheered on the tourists during their verbal clash with a force of approximately 20 people. According to Phuketwan.com, at least three couples had their brollies confiscated and one woman stormed off and vowed to never return. At least three couples had their brollies confiscated and one woman stormed off and vowed to never return . It said the local mayor, Ma-ann Samran, ordered the seizure of the umbrellas because he was concerned too many of them could become a problem. But after the task force departed, five members of the Royal Thai Navy arrived to settle everyone down and inform the tourists that they did not break the law and they are permitted to bring their own parasols to the beach, The Phuket News reported. The confusion apparently stems from the fact that vendors are banned from renting or selling umbrellas or sunloungers near the beach as the local council attempts to eliminate 'clutter'.

"An aunt of a six-year-old Chinese boy who had his eyes gouged out has become the police's prime suspect, state media has said. The blinded boy, Guo Bin, was found covered in blood in the northern province of Shanxi after he went missing while playing outside on August 24. Authorities have now made the boy's aunt, Zhang Huiying, who committed suicide on Friday by jumping down a village well, their prime suspect, the state Xinhua news agency said. The boy's blood was found on the aunt's clothes after DNA tests, according to a statement from police in the city of Linfen, Xinhua said, adding police investigations also pointed towards her.

Guo Bin recuperates with his mother following the attack in the rural area of Linfen city that left him blind . Initial reports had said the corneas . were missing when the boy's eyes were found, leading to speculation that . the attacker was an organ trafficker, but police later ruled out organ . sales as a motive saying the corneas had been found attached to the . eyeballs. Police had offered a 100,000 yuan . ($16,000) reward for information leading to the arrest of the sole . suspect. Reports said the little boy had been drugged before his . eyeballs were gouged out. The brutal attack on the boy -- who has a cleft palate -- shocked Internet users in China, who demanded retribution. Doctors plan to implant artificial . eyeballs in the boy's eye sockets after his inflammation subsides so . that people will not be scared by his appearance in future, his uncle . said, according to earlier media reports.

"An international manhunt is underway for a former Afghan bank worker who is believed to have stolen  $1.1 million. Shokofa Salehi, 22, worked in the money transfer division at the headquarters of Azizi Bank, a major Afghan lender in Kabul. She disappeared around two months ago with investigators saying she is suspected of transferring some $1.1 million out of the bank's coffers to accounts of relatives. Manhunt: Shokofa Salehi, who worked for three years at the Afghan bank, is accused of stealing $1.1 million . Besides Salehi - who worked for three years at the Afghan bank -  at least nine people are believed to be involved in the case. Azizi chief executive Inayatullah Fazli alleged: 'They are a mafia group.' The revelations are another embarrassment for the banking sector in the country, which has seen corruption already unravel one major institution amid ongoing security threats from militants and criminals. An Interpol red notice - the equivalent of an international arrest warrant - describes authorities as seeking Salehi on charges of fraud and misusing her authority. Afghan officials believe Salehi used fake documents under the name Samira to reach India after transferring the money; her current whereabouts are unknown. Two suspects in the case have been detained in Dubai, senior Afghan police official Gen. Aminullah Amarkhail said, adding that he's in touch with counterparts in Dubai and India for help tracking down Salehi and other suspects. Search: Afghan authorities have been scrambling to track down the suspected thief and at least nine other alleged accomplices and an international arrest warrant has been issued . He said one suspect is alleged to have spent some $850,000 of the money to invest in a tire business and possibly other ventures in Dubai. Amarkhail said Salehi's parents were among the suspects, and are believed to have returned to Kabul after going with her to India. Another top police official, Mohammad Zahir, said investigators were still seeking the parents. Azizi Bank's website says it began operating in 2006, and that it now has 'a 1,500-plus strong team of employees and with a 20 per cent female work force is playing a quiet but effective role in women('s) emancipation and empowerment.' It also calls itself 'the bank you can trust.' As striking as it is, Salehi's alleged pilfering pales in comparison to some other examples of corruption in Afghanistan's banking sector. In 2010, regulators seized Kabul Bank, Afghanistan's largest lender, amid allegations of severe levels of graft. Its near-collapse and subsequent bailout represented more than 5 per cent of Afghanistan's gross domestic product, making it one of the largest banking failures in the world in relative terms. An independent report described Kabul Bank as being run like a Ponzi scheme. Investigators said some $861 million in fraudulent loans had disappeared into the pockets of associates of the men behind the bank. Earlier this year, an Afghan tribunal sentenced two top Kabul Bank executives to five years in prison for misappropriating funds. Critics said the punishments were far too light and raised questions about President Hamid Karzai's commitment to rooting out corruption. On Tuesday, Afghanistan announced it was trying once again to privatize what it had salvaged of the bank, which is now called New Kabul Bank. Banks in Afghanistan have also been targeted by Taliban militants and criminal gangs. Not only are they prime targets for people seeking to steal money, they also are gathering places for many government employees seeking to make deposits or cash their paychecks, thus making them attractive to suicide bombers.","Shokofa Salehi worked for major Afghan lender Azizi Bank .

"Unhappy: French actresses Lea Seydoux, left, and Adele Exarchopoulos, right, star in Blue is the Warmest Colour. They claim its director forced them to engage in humiliating acts of sex and violence . Two young actresses who star in one of the  most successful films released this year have claimed they were forced to engage in humiliating acts of sex and violence by its director. Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux both say they will never work with Abdellatif Kechiche again following their experience filming Blue is the Warmest Colour. Their comments are threatening to overshadow the release of the three-hour film - which won the top prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival for its steamy and graphic portrayal of a lesbian love affair. Critics hailed the Franco-Tunisian director as a master following the release of the film. But now the two French actresses have painted a picture of him as over demanding during the filming of some of their no-holds-barred sex scenes. Speaking to The Daily Beast, Exarchopoulos, 19, claimed she was expected to play out graphic lesbian sex scenes under the gaze of the director. 'Most people don't even dare to ask the things that he did and they're more respectful,' she said. The actresses also claimed that Kechiche ordered them to spend 10 days - mostly naked - filming a sex scene which last just ten minutes in the film. It is also claimed the two stars shot their first encounter scene - which lasts 30 seconds -  more than 100 times in one day. As reported by The Times, Exarchopoulos said the most difficult scene to film came when the two characters had a fight after arguing with each other. Seydoux claims the director told her to slap her co-star for real, which left the two actresses resenting their treatment at the hands of the director. Exarchopoulos claims Kechiche . screamed repeatedly for Seydoux to hit her co-star. She said: 'You can . see that we were really suffering.' In May, the film won the prestigious Palme d’Or award at the Cannes Film Festival, which was described as the most sensational win at Cannes in years. One scene includes a no-holds-barred twelve minute erotic sex scene between the two women that leaves nothing to the imagination. Despite the controversy surrounding the film - it has been hailed as a classic because of the performances of its two young stars.

"A former bookmaker and party-loving mother-of-three looks set to claim the title of Miss Universe after becoming a UK bodybuilding champion in her first ever competition. Louise Grayson, 31, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, stunned judges and fellow competitors at last weekend's NAC British Championships at the Manchester Arena... a mere 18 months after first hitting the gym with intent. Louise - who has six-year-old twin girls Codie and Courtney and a son called Bradley, 12 - was the only debutant in the contest, and following her success is now setting her sights on the Miss Universe competition to be held in Manchester in November. Louise was the only debutant in the competition in Manchester, and her win gave her a taste for success, leaving her determined to win the Miss Universe title in November . Just 18 months ago Louise used to be a real 'party girl', always choosing a night out drinking with friends over a trip to the gym . Rising at 6am each morning, eating a diet of nothing but fish for five weeks and enduring arduous training sessions in the gym were all key to the success of the 31-year-old who has transformed herself from party girl to 'supermum'. Louise said: 'I still can't believe that I'm a British bodybuilding champion. I was the only debutant at the event and all the others were stunned... but none more than me. Until 18 months ago I'd class myself as a bit of a party girl!' Louise's partner, Chris Lloyd runs a gym and nutritional supplements business, but she'd always stayed away from the gym in the past, preferring a night out to a training session. She said: 'Chris never encouraged me to get into the gym. I just started training and when I saw the changes in my body I knew that I wanted to do something with it. Now I'm hooked. I love training and the adrenaline hit it brings. It's great.' Louise, pictured performing in Manchester, says her partner Chris Lloyd runs a gym . and nutritional supplements business, but she'd always stayed away from . the gym in the past, preferring a night out . Louise swapped pints of lager for gym sessions, and now works with her partner Chris at his nutritional supplement business . Louise, a former bookmaker with . Ladbrokes at branches throughout Rotherham, has now teamed up with Chris . at his business, Streetwise Supplements Ltd, at Gateway Court, . Parkgate. Her remarkable win at Sunday's NAC . Championships has seen her qualify automatically for the body building . world championships in Cyprus later this year. But . she is uncertain she will go as she already struggles with a packed . schedule of training, work and fulfilling her role as mother to three . young children. So instead she is focusing on the Miss Universe contest . back in Manchester in November. Along with Louise's own children, Chris' 11-year-old son Daniel completes the family. Rising at 6am each morning, eating a diet . of nothing but fish for five weeks and enduring arduous training . sessions in the gym were all key to the success of the 31-year-old 'supermum' Louise, posing with her trainer in Manchester, left, says her children call her 'fit mum' now, and her twin daughters Codie and Courtney pose with her in front of the mirror . She said: 'It has been hard fitting the training in at times, but I'm usually up and away at 6am for an hour-long cardio session and I'm back before they even get up so that I can get them ready for school. 'They've all been really supportive. They call me ""fit mum"" now and the twins come and pose with me in the mirror.' Louise trains four days a week and takes classes at Chris's gym, hoping that she can inspire others to get fit. Her regime changes depending on her proximity to a competition, as does her diet. For the past weeks, she has eaten nothing but fish and has only now been able to re-introduce other food into her meals. Louise before she started training, left, and now, right, having swapped pints and nights out for gym sessions four times a week . A relieved Louise admitted: 'It's nice to have potatoes and things again. The appeal of a fish breakfast soon wears off.' Proud . partner Chris, who trained Louise to victory despite having no . experience of bodybuilding competition, said: 'I'm really proud of what . she's achieved. 'When we . first met she was a party girl and she really only got into training . about 18 months ago. 'To win a national contest is just unbelievable. She's a real inspiration. Hopefully it'll encourage others to get in the . gym and get fit.'","Louise Grayson, 31, is from Rotherham, South Yorkshire .

"Hacked to death: Lt Col David Parkinson (right) was attacked by five intruders as he was sleeping beside his wife of 35 years, Sonja (left), in Kenya . The wife of a former Parachute Regiment officer who was hacked to death in Kenya has described his killers as ‘evil' and called his murder 'senseless'. Nature reserve manager Lt Col David Parkinson, 58, was killed by five robbers at the remote home he shared with his wife Sonja on Sunday morning in Lolldaiga Hills, near Mount Kenya National Park. Mrs Parkinson 52, managed to escape and barricade herself in . the house’s panic room. Lt Col Parkinson is believed to have bled to death during the raid in which the armed gang stole a laptop, $3 and bottles of wine. Speaking about her husband's death for the first time today, Mrs Parkinson told the Daily Telegraph: 'David was brutally killed in the most senseless way.' She also described her husband as 'a good man' and  'a loving husband ' and said the men who killed him posed a serious threat to other people. Describing his work in conservation and training in Kenya, she said: 'His activities have resulted in direct improvements to the lives and . skills of many in the surrounding community. 'They too are telling us . that his loss is also their loss and that they too are sharing our . pain.' Despite her husband's death, Mrs Parkinson said she intends to remain in Kenya. A local man has been detained and questioned over the attack on the Parkinsons but has not been formally arrested in connection with Sunday’s break-in. The couple were asleep when the robbers smashed their way into their bedroom  and demanded money and guns. Mrs Parkinson was tied up and threatened and her husband attacked as he fought to defend her. Police believe he may have been knocked unconscious before being struck with broad-bladed machetes, known locally as pangas. Crime scene: David Parkinson's house in Nanyuki, Laikipia where robbers raided his home and killed him . Grief: Friends of Lt Col Parkinson at his farm are coming to terms with his brutal murder . Lt Co Parkinson, from Brighton. East Sussex, was formerly a director of Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya, where Prince William spent part of his gap year. He was awarded an OBE in 1998 for his military service. Police said there were parallels with the robbery and a raid on the home of another former British army officer and his wife in the region in June. Two men are expected to face trial for that attack, but two other raiders had not been traced. Last night, Kenyan police said the retired soldier’s hand was cut off as he struggled with the intruders in order to give his wife enough time to reach safety. Local police chief Maurice Tum said the robbers gained entry by smashing the windows and ordered Lt Col Parkinson to hand over money and guns. Tragedy: Lt Col David Parkinson was killed in the farmhouse of the Lolldaiga Hills ranch in Kenya (pictured) He added: ‘A fight ensured between the men and the soldier and they cut off his left hand and left him bleeding profusely. 'The . wife hid in the strong room. It was this decision which saved her. She . came out and found her bleeding husband and contacted the police.’ Lt Col Parkinson, who served in the Army for 30 years, became manager of the ranch after leaving Lewa in 2008. Before taking up his place at St Andrews University, Prince William spent his gap year at Lewa, helping with various conservation projects. In 2010, he and Kate holidayed there, staying in a secluded rustic log cabin where William proposed. The Duchess said: ‘He’s a true romantic and we had a wonderful holiday in Africa. It was very romantic and it was a very personal time for both of us.’ Last night the Duke of Cambridge, who is a patron of Lewa, said he was ‘saddened’ to hear about Lt Col Parkinson’s death. Mrs Parkinson, who owns a local arts and crafts company called Mitumba Art, was taken to hospital and treated for shock. 'Saddened': The soldier was formerly a director of Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, where Prince William (right) spent his gap year as a 19-year-old and where he proposed to Kate Middleton (left, with Prince George) A friend and neighbour said: ‘He was very . dynamic, doing an amazing job in Lolldaiga for both conservation and . the community. He was a very well-liked man.’ Lt Col Parkinson joined the Army in 1973 after graduating from the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. 'A fight ensured between the men and the soldier and they cut off his left hand and left him bleeding profusely' Maurice Tum, local Kenyan police chief . Known to his fellow soldiers as Parky, he joined the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces, before becoming chief instructor at Sandhurst. On his last tour before retiring, he commanded the British Army training organisation in Nairobi. In 2003, he and his wife permanently relocated to Kenya where he took up his post with Lewa, a growing conservation and community development project. The couple sold their home in Hassocks, West Sussex, for £500,000 three years later. They have two daughters, Anna, 33 and Renate, 29. Lt Col Parkinson took up the post with Lolldaiga Hills at the start of this year. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ‘We are aware of the death of a British national in Kenya and our team at the High Commission in Nairobi are providing consular assistance.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Lt Col David Parkinson, 58, attacked as he slept beside wife Sonja .

"Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown is set to announce he will quit as an MP at the next General Election. He is expected to formally reveal his plans to stand down 'within days' after 32 years in the Commons, sources have claimed. One close colleague predicted he may write to Labour Party members in his Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath constituency in the next few days and make a formal announcement before Christmas. Sources claim Mr Brown is eager to bow out 'on a high' after he was widely credited for helping keep Britain together with a passionate 'war cry' in Glasgow the day before votes were cast. Scroll down for video . Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown will step down after 32 years in the House of Commons . A close ally of the former Labour PM disclosed to the Sunday Mirror: 'Gordon has confirmed to friends that he will stand down at the election in May. 'He wants to go out on a high after effectively salvaging the campaign to keep the UK together in September. He will focus on his charity work.' 'Gordon always holds a function for his party members at Christmas and if I were a betting man, I would bet that he will make an announcement then,' a source told Sky News. Another senior source said: 'I'm reliably informed he will make an announcement in the coming weeks.' Sources revealed that Mr Brown is quitting politics to focus on his charity work along with his wife Sarah . Since losing the 2010 election to David Cameron, Mr Brown has concentrated along with his wife Sarah on charity work and his role as UN Special Envoy for Global Education. The 63-year-old had been criticised by political opponents for his rare appearances in the Commons until his stirring comeback in the Scottish referendum. In the Glasgow speech viewed as the crucial turning point for the Union, Mr Brown tore into Alex Salmond, insisting Scotland does not belong to him or any other politician, declaring: 'Scotland belongs to all of us.' Speaking without notes, he urged anyone with doubts about the risks of separation to vote No to save the Union, adding: 'What we created together, let no nationalist split asunder.' Gordon Brown was widely credited with keeping Britain together, especially after his passionate speech . The former Prime Minister Mr Brown was one of the stand-out performers of the No campaign . His departure is another hammer blow for the Labour Party in Scotland which could lose a swath of seats to the SNP in May. The announcement of the new Scottish Labour leader will be made on December 13, with Jim Murphy the favourite to land the role. The former Prime Minister will not bow to calls to take up a senior Labour role in Scotland to help the party get back on track north of the border. Allies also say he has no plans to take up a seat in the House of Lords. His resignation is also likely to see a fight among the party's rising stars for the safe seat of Kirkcadly and Cowdenbeath which won a majority of more than 23,000 in the last election. Mr Brown's intentions to stand down come after his former Chancellor Alistair Darling announced earlier this month that he would stand down as an MP in May. Mr Brown entered the House of Commons in 1983 when he won a majority of 11,000 in Dunfermline East . After Labour's landslide election victory in 1997, Gordon Brown became Chancellor of the Exchequer . Mr Brown became the longest-serving Chancellor in modern history and was in the job for 10 years . There were reports Mr Brown became increasingly frustrated at having to wait for Mr Blair to give up power . The former Prime Minister entered the House of Commons as a member for Dunfermline East in 1983, where he secured a majority of 11,000 in 1983. He joined the Shadow Cabinet in 1989 as Shadow Secretary of State for Trade, and was later promoted to become Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1992. After Labour's landslide victory in 1997 where it won a massive 179-seat majority, he was appointed Chancellor. In that position, he became the longest-serving holder of that office in modern history. Over his 10 years at the Treasury, Mr Brown earned a reputation as the 'Iron Chancellor' who promised there would be no return to 'boom and bust.' Days into the role he gave the Bank of England the freedom to set interest rates through the Bank's monetary policy committee in a move that was widely praised. While Mr Brown helped oversee strong growth in the UK economy, he attracted criticism for his decision to scrap tax relief on pension funds and his abolition of the 10p tax rate paid by people on low incomes. After years of waiting to become Prime Minister, Mr Brown finally entered No 10 on June 27, 2007 . In his first few months in charge, Mr Brown was praised for for his handling of crises including failed terrorist attacks, flooding, a foot and mouth disease outbreak and the run on Northern Rock . Having been made PM, Mr Brown enjoyed an uneasy relationship with the media - he is pictured here in 2008 shaking hands with Elisabeth Murdoch, Baroness Amos and Rebekah Wade, the former editor of the Sun . While on the campaign trail in Rochdale ahead of the 2010 general election, Mr Brown was caught on microphone describing local pensioner Gillian Duffy as 'bigoted' when she quizzed him about immigration . After losing the election, Mr Brown resigned as Prime Minister on May 10, 2010 and leader of the Labour Party . It has never been confirmed when - if at all - Mr Blair agreed to step aside and relinquish power to Mr Brown, but there were reports the Chancellor was becoming increasingly frustrated at having to wait. He eventually replaced Mr Blair at No 10 Downing Street in June 2007. He is the sixth post-war Prime Minister, of a total of 12, to assume the role without having won a general election. In his first few months in charge, Mr Brown was praised for for his handling of crises including failed terrorist attacks, flooding, a foot and mouth disease outbreak and the run on Northern Rock. But after initial success, Labour's popularity under Mr Brown started to dwindle with the onset of the global recession in 2008. The following year Labour suffered poor results in the local and European elections. While on the campaign trial ahead of the 2010 general election, Mr Brown was caught on microphone describing local pensioner Gillian Duffy as 'bigoted' after she quizzed him about immigration. His political opponents said the gaffe was evidence he held voters in contempt. In the election, Labour lost 91 seats, the party's biggest loss of seats in a single general election since 1931 and days later Mr Brown resigned as Prime Minister and leader of the Labour Party. Since then, Mr Brown faced criticism for his rare appearance in the Commons and even described himself as an ex-politician during a summit on education in Qatar last year. But the former Prime Minister made a storming return to front-line politics when he helped galvanise support for the Union during the Scottish independence referendum. The second son of Rev Dr John Ebenezer Brown, a Church of Scotland minister, Gordon Brown was brought up in Kirkcaldy, a small coastal town north of Edinburgh in Scotland. At the age of 16, he joined Edinburgh University to study history becoming the youngest undergraduate there since the war. He became a Labour MP for Dunfermline East at the second attempt in 1983 with a majority of 11,000, after briefly working as a lecturer and TV reporter, and began forging an alliance with fellow MP Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson. He was made chancellor in 1992, choosing not to stand for leadership thereby clearing the way for Blair, on the understanding he would retain power at some point. After Labour's 1997 landslide victory, Brown became the most powerful chancellor in modern times. But he never stopped coveting the top job and  spend much of the next 10 years pushing Blair to make good on their deal. Gordon Brown enjoyed a mixed relationship with Tony Blair and craved the leadership for many years . When Blair finally stood down in 2007, after winning three Labour election victories, Brown was made party leader, and prime minister, without a contest. However he found the job he had so craved more difficult than he envisaged and he struggled, particularly with the onset of the global recession in 2008. After a disastrous showing in the local and European elections in 2009, he lost the 2010 general election campaign after losing more than 90 Labour MPs in what was Labour's worst electoral performance since Michael Foot in 1983. Mr Brown returned to the front line political stage for the Scottish referendum and played a crucial role in keeping the Union with a barnstorming speech in Glasgow the day before votes were cast.","Gordon Brown will formally announce plans to stand down 'within days'

"A girl nicknamed 'Jaws' because of her severe underbite is embracing her life post-surgery. Leanne Woodfull, 20, from Dublin, Ireland, was teased and tormented throughout her teenage years by cruel bullies who compared her to the James Bond villain because of her protruding jaw. It was caused by a brace that was fitted when she was 11 but this year, shortly before her birthday, Leanne underwent life-changing surgery to fix what she perceived as a deformity. Scroll down for video . Leanne developed a severe underbite when she was fitted with . 'train-track' style braces as a child.

'My big jaw was ruining my life and I'm just so happy I can finally smile with confidence,' Leanne, from Dublin, said. 'When I look in the mirror I'm relieved to see the 'Jaws' girl I once knew has finally disappeared.' Leanne noticed the change in her face when she was fitted with 'train-track' style braces as a child. As her top teeth straightened out, they pushed back into her mouth, meeting edge to edge with her bottom set and causing her lower jaw to protrude outwards. Leanne Woodfull (pictured post-procedure) underwent surgery to fix her severe underbite. Surgeons broke both her jaws and re-set them into a new position, inserting titaniums plates into her mouth. After five hours, her face was transformed . Leanne's chin jutted out dramatically (pictured from various angles before surgery) and as a result her school life turned into a nightmare. At the age of 13, bullies started comparing her to big- chinned Family Guy character James William Bottomtooth III . Her entire chin stuck out as a result and by the time she was 13, she said her school life had turned into a nightmare, with bullies also comparing toFamily Guy character James William Bottomtooth III. Leanne (X-ray of her jaw before surgery) was eventually beaten up by cruel bullies because of her skull deformity . Leanne, a sales assistant, said: 'The kids would tease and say ""Look there's a real life jaws"". 'Even my own friends nicknamed me Jaws - I was the butt of everyone's jokes. 'Classmates would sneer 'bulldog' and one even sniggered that I looked like some guy from Family Guy. 'I didn't know who it was so I Googled it and was horrified. I felt like a gargoyle.

Leanne began to think she had a deformed face and would avoid having . her picture taken and banned her mother, Violet, from putting up any pictures of her . in the house. She added: 'Between the ages of 12 and 18 it was like I didn't exist. No matter how much my family told me I was beautiful the way I was, they didn't have to live with it. 'They said I didn't have a deformed face. I was the odd one out and every day I was reminded of it.' Leanne was desperate to have corrective surgery but was told by her . orthodontist her body needed to stop growing before she could qualify. Leanne was desperate for corrective surgery but her orthodontist said her body needed to stop growing before she could qualify. She was set to re-mortgage the house to pay for the procedure privately when in March this year, aged 19, Leanne got her wish and was granted double jaw surgery on the NHS . When Leanne (pictured in recovery) came around, the surgeon told her the operation had been successful, but that a nerve had been damaged and there was a risk that her bottom lip and some of her chin would remain numb forever. Luckily there have been no long-term problems . Within just five hours Leanne's face had been transformed. Leanne (pictured before surgery, left, and after, right) said: 'When the bandages came off for the first time it was emotional seeing my new face' But as she got so depressed, she pleaded with her mother to do something because it was ruining her life. Her family were set to remortgage the house to pay for it privately when in March this year, aged 19, Leanne got her wish and was granted double jaw surgery on the HSE (Health Service Executive, the Irish Health Service). Leanne continued: 'It was ruining my life. [For me] it was a matter of life or death. I'd never wanted to grow up so quickly. 'I became severely depressed after seeing all the stunning models when I went to London Fashion Week last October. 'I . practically hibernated for five months. If I had to go out in public . then I would bury my face in a thick scarf to hide my protruding chin.' Surgeons . broke both her jaws and re-set them into the new position, inserting . titaniums plates into her mouth and after five hours in surgery, her . face was transformed. Leanne (pictured after surgery) now feels far more confident about her face.

'We decided to wait in the vicinity of the barracks that is in Woolwich,' he said. Testimony: Michael Adebolajo said he loved Al Qaeda and said its members were his 'brothers' 'By . the command of Allah, by Allah's decree, whilst waiting to find a . soldier because between us we decided that the soldier is the most fair . target because he joins the Army with kind of an understanding that your . life is at risk when you join, you know. 'So we sat in wait and it just so happened that he was the soldier that was spotted first'. Adebolajo . had just been released from hospital after a week of lifesaving . treatment, having charged police swinging a meat cleaver before before . being shot by armed officers. The interview from June 1, . played to the court, shows British born Adebolajo has adopted an accent, although from time to time he slips back into his London accent. ‘When I thought about obeying Allah in the past I thought maybe it is possible to kill a man by driving into him,’ he said. ‘When . he crossed the road in front of me so casually it was almost as if I . was not in control of myself. I accelerated, I hit him and I think I . also crashed into a sign post.’ Cold-blooded: Michael Adebowale, 22, of Greenwich, south-east London, with a knife in his hand after he had hacked Lee Rigby to death . He . went on: ‘We did not wish to give him much pain - I could see he was . still alive. We exited the vehicle and I am not sure how I struck the . first blow. ‘The most . humane way to kill any creature is to cut the jugular, this is what I . believe, this is how we kill our animals in Islam. He may be my enemy . but he is a man - so I struck at the neck and attempted to remove his . head.’ He said he . thought Fusilier Rigby was the ‘non-Muslim version of myself and my . brother Ismail [ie Adebowale]’, adding: ‘To be killed on the battlefield . is not something we shy away from and in fact this is something that . Allah loves.’ 'Brutal': The two men accused of the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby, Michael Adebolajo (right) and Michael Adebowale (second right) hacked at Lee Rigby like 'he was a tree', witnesses said . Earlier in . the video, Adebolajo insisted that the alleged killing was not ‘a . personal vendetta’, and said he would like to speak to the dead . soldier’s family. ‘I . have never met the family of Lee Rigby’, he said. ‘Quite possibly I may . have walked past one of them in the street. I do not hate them. I do not . hate them, nor does my brother Ismail, he does not. This is not a . personal vendetta.’ Adebolajo appeared to break down for a few seconds as he recalled the events and muttered: ‘Forgive me, OK'","Police release video of Michael Adebolajo's first police interview on June 1 .

"Two brothers who attacked the cousin of former Strictly Come Dancing star Laila Rouass and left him to drown in a reservoir have been found guilty of manslaughter. Amran Chowdhury, 27, and his brother Misba, 24, were convicted of killing 20-year-old Ibrahim Gharib, whose body was pulled from the Shadwell Basin in east London in March 2010. The jury was told that Mr Gharib, the cousin of actress Ms Rouass, had been with his girlfriend Seema Uddin, then 17, when the couple were set upon by a gang, including the Chowdhury brothers. Guilty: Brothers Amran Chowdhary, 27, (left) and Misba Chowdhary, 24, (with his brother) were convicted of the killing of 20-year-old Ibrahim Gharib (right), who drowned in the Shadwell Basin in east London in 2010 . Miss Uddin was knocked unconscious when she was hit by a bottle, the court was told, while Mr Gharib ended up in the freezing water. Two passers by had tried to rescue him from, but were thwarted by the cold, and his body was recovered the following morning by a police underwater search team. Although no witnesses saw Mr Gharib go in the water, the Chowdhury brothers were convicted of manslaughter at the Old Bailey on Friday for taking part in the attack. Star: Mr Gharib was the cousin of actress Laila Rouass, who came fourth in the BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing in 2009, and starred in Footballers Wives and Holby City . They will be sentenced on a date to be set later this week. After Mr Gharib’s death Ms Rouass, who starred in Footballers Wives and Holby City is now engaged to snooker player Ronnie O’Sullivan, said her family were ‘devastated’. ‘It’s a terrible waste of life,’ added Ms Rouass, who came fourth in the BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing in 2009. Former couple: Amran Chowdhury’s (left) ex-girlfriend Steffi Rai, 26, (right) was convicted of perverting the course of justice by trying to help him evade the police . Amran Chowdhury’s ex-girlfriend Steffi Rai, 26, was convicted of perverting the course of justice by trying to help him evade the police. She will be sentenced on 3 October. During the trial the court was told that Mr Gharib had gone to the dock basin with Miss Uddin, who he had been dating for just a week, on the evening of March 18, 2010. Convicted: Rai, (pictured) who drove Amran Chowdary to Birmingham after the attack, will be sentenced next month . John McGuinness QC, prosecuting, said: ‘While these two young people were passing time together that evening, talking, chatting, drinking, they were set upon by a group of men - probably a group of five young men. ‘Two of the group were the Chowdhury brothers. ‘There is no eyewitness who saw Ibrahim Ghrib go into the water, not even Seema Uddin. ‘Nevertheless, it is the case for the prosecution that his death was not an accident.’ Mr Gharib was found floating in the water at around 9.30pm. He had bruises on his right cheek and right elbow and tests showed he was two and a half times over the drink drive limit. A post mortem examination revealed he had drowned in the 30ft-deep water. Detectives found Amran Chowdhury's mobile phone in a nearby street, and although he admitted being there that night, he denied any involvement in the attack. He had spent the night in a local hotel before Rai drove him to Birmingham. Misba Chowdhury told police he spent the whole evening looking after his parents at the home he shared with his family, not far from the reservoir. The brothers, both of Ilford, Essex, had both denied manslaughter and the alternative charge of affray, while Rai, of Queensway, Birmingham, denied perverting the course of justice. Detective Constable Darrell Etchells, the investigating officer from the Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: ‘Today’s convictions mark the end of a long and extensive investigation to bring to justice those responsible for Ibrahim’s death. ‘No motive has ever been discovered for the attack but I hope Ibrahim’s family can find some peace in the fact that the jury are satisfied the Chowdhury brothers were responsible for his death.’","Brothers Amran and Misba Chowdhury convicted of killing Ibrahim Gharib .

"Try as he might, Alastair Cook just cannot rid himself of Kevin Pietersen. As England crashed to another one-day defeat, this time by eight wickets with more than 10 overs to spare, Cook’s former team-mate and unfailing bête noire was calling for his resignation on Twitter. The worry for Cook, as Sri Lanka moved with embarrassing ease into a 2-0 lead in this seven-match series, is that Pietersen was able to do so without sounding bitter. ‘Dear Alastair,’ he tweeted, ‘if you care about England’s chances this winter, pls resign and just concentrate on Test cricket... #getHalesin’ Kevin Pietersen has called on England captain to resign from his post for one-day internationals . Alex Hales, the talented Nottinghamshire opener who has watched both defeats in Colombo from the pavilion, might not have saved England as they slumped to a dismal 185. But his selection alone might just have lifted a few spirits. And England’s spirits need lifting — the captain’s more than anyone’s. Since Cook led England to the final of the Champions Trophy on home soil in 2013, he has presided over 11 losses in 16 one-day internationals. One of his five wins came against Scotland. England’s lone series victory in that period — earlier this year in the Caribbean — came when Stuart Broad was in charge. And there are a maximum of 10 games left before the World Cup starts on February 14. Time is running out. Kevin Pietersen says Alex Hales should replace Cook as captain of one-day side . Cook the batsman is faring little better. The 22 he made in 37 balls here meant he has now gone 55 innings without a century in both Tests and one-day internationals. Informed of Pietersen’s observation, he offered a weary grin: ‘Good job I’m not on social media. People are totally entitled to their view. That’s the nature of the beast when you’re on the outside.’ However, this latest defeat also prompted Sir Ian Botham to call for the captain to be replaced. ‘England do need to make changes and they’ve got to make them quickly,’ Botham told Sky Sports. ‘Personally, I would bring in Alex Hales at the top of the order with Moeen Ali — so that means the captain has to step down. ‘I would make (Eoin) Morgan captain because I think that’s just what he needs — I think he thinks a bit more out of the box.’ England legend Ian Botham called for Eoin Morgan to be made captain . It has been a tough few days for the England captain, who had spent the build-up to this match presiding over a squad still coming to terms with the death of Phillip Hughes. For a while, the day proceeded in an air of unreality. A book of condolences was signed, a minute’s silence observed, and flags flown at half mast above the Premadasa Stadium’s giant scoreboard. Perhaps mindful of Hughes, who died after being hit by a bouncer, the first short ball did not arrive until the 28th over. But if the players have felt his death strongly, especially the trio who once counted him as a county colleague — Ali, Morgan and Steven Finn — then there should be no mistake: England wanted to win this game. More than that, they needed to. Instead, they managed only eight boundaries in 43 overs after rain had cut the match to 45 a side. Only Ravi Bopara and Joe Root passed 22. England’s bowlers were then effortlessly manoeuvred this way and that by Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene. Cook was dismissed by Tillakaratne Dilshan as England went down by eight wickets against Sri Lanka . But it was England’s batting that let them down. Ali, fresh from a sparkling century three days earlier, fell in the second over to the off-breaks of Tillakeratne Dilshan, who then persuaded the strokeless Cook to slog-sweep to deep square leg. In between, Ian Bell picked out long-off. Later, Morgan added to his own growing catalogue of cheap dismissals. Root and Bopara, with his second half-century of the series, did their best but England did not look capable of curing all their ills in time for the World Cup. As long as England keep losing and Cook keeps failing, there will be only one question in town. Cook said: ‘You feel the heat when you’re not scoring runs. How we respond will be really important.’ The next game is on Wednesday in Hambantota. For England and Cook, it has already assumed the proportions of a must-win.","England lost by eight wickets against Sri Lanka on Saturday .

"When drivers report their cars stolen - they expect never to see them again. But for Alex Walden it took just 15 minutes before she was reunited with her stolen car - with  the alleged thief still in the driver’s seat. Miss Walden was with her boyfriend, Ryan Tippetts,  when they discovered her black Jetta had been taken from the University Hill neighborhood in Boulder, Colorado. Bizarre: Alex Walden and her boyfriend, Ryan Tippetts, pictured, reported her car stolen but just 15 minutes later it appeared in front of them at an intersection - with the alleged thief at the wheel . But just 15 minutes after contacting police officers, the Jetta reappeared in front of their eyes. The couple were crossing an intersection when Miss Walden realised the car in front of them - waiting to let them cross the road -  was her own. So Miss Walden decided to confront the man driving her car. Speaking to ABCNews.com,  Walden said: 'I asked him what he was doing and he said, ""I’m trying to let ya’ll cross the street"". He didn’t realize who we were and I told him to get out of my car.' However, the man allegedly driving the vehicle - former University of Colorado running back Davien Payne, 20, refused. Mr Tippetts then decided to attempt to recover his girlfriend's vehicle by force. Police say he dove through the passenger-side window and fought with Payne for control of the steering wheel. He was left badly injured after being punched in the face and throat about 20 times while attempting  to prevent the moving car from crashing. Eventually  Payne allegedly got out of the car and attempted to run away but he was captured by police officers. Following his fight, Mr Tippetts suffered from a broken larynx and has six titanium plates with screws holding his throat together. He said: 'I’ve got a bunch of metal in my throat so now I have to worry about going through metal detectors.' Payne has been charged with aggravated motor vehicle theft, two counts of second-degree assault, resisting arrest, obstructing a police officer and third-degree trespassing. His next court appearance is on  September 12 in Boulder. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Alex Walden and boyfriend Ryan Tippetts discovered car was stolen .

"Lonely bachelors looking for love often turn to dating websites in the search for a partner. But Robert Darling has taken things that little bit further - by wandering the streets of New York for twelve years with a sandwich board asking women to marry him. The unemployed 58-year-old - who admits he is a 'great conversationalist'  -  says he wants a wealthy lady to take care of him. Scroll down for video . Lonely: Robert Darling could be a contender for America's most desperate man after wandering the streets for twelve years with a sandwich board looking for love.

The New Jersey,resident  spends two hours traveling to Manhattan twice a week on his quest for a soulmate. His billboard declares he is open to offers and includes his phone number and email address. Plagued with an unsuccessful love life for forty years, he resorted to extreme measures to find a suitor. Mr Darling said: 'I've never had any luck with the ladies and while this is going to extremes I'm confident I can find love this way. Catch: Mr Darling admits he has never had any luck with women. This photograph shows him posing in his underwear in 1973 . Handsome: Mr Darling says he has been told by women that he is handsome and admits he is a 'great conversationalist' 'I get a good reaction from most people, they think it's funny but I am really serious. 'I'm looking for companionship, . conversation, to go to museums and concerts - but I just don't have the . resources to pay for that. 'So I need a wealthy lady to take care of me - I think I deserve it.' Mr Darling said he has never had a serious relationship and his dating history is sparse. 'As far as a serious relationship, I've never had one,' he said. I've never been engaged, never proposed to anybody.' Hopeful: Plagued with an unsuccessful love life for forty years, the 58-year-old has resorted to extreme measures to find a suitor . He takes his sign to upmarket areas of the city such as Wall Street, Columbus Circle and Times Square. 'There's a lot of money . on Wall Street, maybe I'll meet a female Chief Executive Officer who . will decide to become my wife,' he said. 'The sign will bring attention to me and my great smile will close the deal.' Mr Darling has also searched dating websites like Craigslist but has never had any luck. Looking for love: Mr Darling is pictured outside his home in Bradley Beach, New Jersey . He often gets phone calls in response to his sign, but none are serious inquiries. 'A woman called me once and I thought it looked promising - but . she actually wanted to hook me up with her friend who needed a green . card to stay in the country.' And his unusual suitor methods have also helped him cure social anxiety issues he was facing. He said: 'I'm enjoying myself every time I go to New York - I'm very secure of myself and I think that's helped.' But his unique approach gets mixed responses from people he meets. Onlooker Joyce Brill, a tourist from Virginia, said: 'I would not call Robert, I would not go on a date with him - absolutely not. 'He's been doing this for so long and he and his sandwich board are kind of scruffy.' However, LaSonda Stephenson from New Jersey was kinder with her verdict. She said: 'I think it's pretty courageous - it's not something I would do, but I applaud him for not being shy about it. 'Everyone deserves a fair shot at love.' But despite the wait, Mr Darling remains undeterred in his pursuit for true love. He said: 'There's an incredible amount I have to offer - I'm intelligent, almost brilliant. 'I've heard I'm handsome once or twice, and I'm a great conversationalist. To Ms Right out there I would say, ""Call my number or email me"". 'We could talk and see if we're made for each other. It would be a great pleasure to see you if you're in New York City. 'Hopefully it will be a happy marriage. And he has no plans to hang up his sign any time soon.' He said: 'Give up? Never! I'm just warming up. It's just a matter of time. I'm very patient and I know great success is just around the corner.'","Robert Darling  spends two hours traveling to Manhattan twice a week .

"A pastor from Bellevue, Washington, has produced an inventive - and hilarious - video, which seeks to educate people on how they can better phrase their questions to adoptive families, in order to avoid causing offense. Jesse Butterworth, 36, the father of two biological sons and one adopted daughter, Harper, two, has made a three minute YouTube tutorial on the matter, using an unlikely analogy to illustrate his point. 'If you wouldn’t say it about a boob job, don't say it about an adoptive family', he reasons. Happy family: Mr Butterworth, 36, says he wants to protect his adopted daughter, Harper, 2 (pictured with his two biological sons), from hurtful comments when she grows up . The video, billed as 'A public service announcement from adoptive families everywhere', has scored over 18,500 views and a rapturous applause since it was uploaded earlier this week, and stars Mr Butterworth playing a number of comedy roles himself. In it, he re-enacts some of the things people have said to him in regards to his daughter, who was born in Ethiopia. 'Are those real?' he feigns, leering at a woman's chest. And then, to the same woman holding his daughter, 'Is that your real daughter?!' Jokester: Mr Butterworth (pictured) has created a YouTube video which seeks to educate people on the right way to talk about adoption . Acting skills: In the three minute video tutorial, Mr Butterworth re-enacts, to hilarious effect, some of the real things people have to said to him about his daughter Harper, 2 . At which point, Mr Butterworth steps in to respond to the inquiry. 'Yup, she's real, she's not a unicorn,' he says, deadpan, before instructing his audience that their correct phrasing should be: 'Is she your biological daughter?' 'Weeew, where'd you get those?' he squeals animatedly in the next clip, pointing at the woman's chest, and then, indicating his daughter: 'Where did you get her from?' To which Mr Butterworth responds: 'As adorable as she is, my daughter actually isn't a 'trendy accessory.' The correct question in this instance? 'Where is she from?' according to the proud dad. Precious: This touching photo was taken of little Harper touching her soon-to-be father's face, captured before he officially adopted her . When juxtaposing the question of whether the woman got to 'pick out' her own boobs, to someone asking whether he got to 'pick' the daughter he wanted, the pastor-turned-jokester has an amusing response. 'Nope, we didn't actually go and haggle... and try to find the cutest little red-headed orphan. That only happens in musicals,' he says. The question we should be asking, he points out, is: 'How does the adoption process actually work?' Excitement: Mr Butterworth, with his wife Marina (right), in a snap they shared on Facebook while they were on their way to pick up baby Harper . He concludes his lessons in the art of delicacy with a somewhat poignant comparison. 'Aww, did you get them because you couldn't have boobs of your own?' he asks, with mock pity. And then warns: 'This is probably a question you want to avoid altogether. 'Because adoption isn't always the result of infertility - and even if it was, it's none of your business.' Mr Butterworth and his wife Maria were inspired to create the tutorial after one of their first outings with Harper, to a restaurant, was interrupted by the insensitive questions from the couple's waitress. The new father spoke to TODAY Moms about the incident. 'I really, really, really don’t think that people are trying to be mean,' he maintains. Adoption isn't always the result of infertility - and even if it was, it's none of your business . 'People are curious, that’s human nature and it’s natural to ask questions,' he goes on. 'So we were thinking, what’s a way that we could help people just put language around it?'

"Six years ago she created a statue of a ‘typical family’ showing a mother, father and two children. That was in Italy. Asked to do something similar in Britain, however, Gillian Wearing has come up with a sculpture which many may feel is far from typical. Her £100,000 work representing what it means to be an ‘ordinary’ family in 2014 is of two single mothers and their children. Sisters Roma and Emma Jones and their sons Kyan and Shaye were chosen from 372 nominations to be the subjects of A Real Birmingham Family. The £100,000 bronze sculpture immortalises the Jones family made up by sisters Emma and Roma and their sons Kyan and Shaye . The real thing: Sisters Roma and Emma Jones with their sons, pictured next to the statue which depicts their family set-up . The family stand next to their sculpture in Birmingham (left) - which is a million miles away from the artist's depiction of a typical family in Italy, created six years ago, which is made up of a more conventional mother, father and two kids (right) The bronze sculpture by the Turner Prize winner shows the four of them hand-in-hand and Emma heavily pregnant with her second son, Isaac, now eight months old. But the absence of any adult male or father figure has drawn criticism. The mixed race sisters, who live separately, have not revealed details of their family set-up, leaving many to ask why the fathers aren’t included in the piece. Birmingham Yardley MP John Hemming said: ‘There’s absolutely nothing wrong with single parent families but I always find it sad when fathers are not involved in the lives of their children.’ The Lib Dem also questioned why public money was spent on such a controversial sculpture. ‘When the council can’t afford to clear up the rubbish on the streets, £100,000 is not peanuts,’ he said. Craig Pickering, of the charity Families Need Fathers, said: ‘Everybody knows that families can come in all sorts of shapes and sizes but this interpretation of a family seems most bizarre. It is factually inaccurate and totally out of step. ‘Children do better when they have both their mother and their father playing an active role in their lives.’ Dr Patricia Morgan, a leading researcher on family policy, said the artist’s decision to portray a fatherless family was ‘a disgrace’. ‘We should know whether or not there’s a man involved here,’ she said. ‘Is he taking responsibility, living with them, or not? These are things the viewer needs to know. ‘They are putting this up as some kind of ideal which people have to be like or have to evolve in this direction, but it represents under 1 per cent of the population.’ The sisters say the sculpture will help other families with unusual set-ups feel welcome in Birmingham. The artwork took four years to complete after artist Gillian Wearing invited members of the public to nominate local families . The family was chosen for their closeness, said Wearing, who took inspiration from carrying out a similar project in Italy . One of the sisters, who are both single, is depicted as pregnant. Hundreds of families were nominated as part of the project . The sculpture is designed to celebrate 'the unsung and everyday' elements of Birmingham city life according to organisers . After receiving nominations and suggestions for a variety of family structures the artist and a panel of judges selected the Jones family . Speaking of the suggestions, one organiser said while a nuclear family was the most traditional, it is no longer the norm in Birmingham . The sisters and their brothers, Robin, 25, and Jay, 23, were raised by their mother, Karen Jones, a single parent, in a council house . The plaque on the sculpture, which describes those featured in the work of art . Gillian Wearing was born in Birmingham in 1963. The artist shot to fame in the 1990s with a collection of photographs she had taken of strangers in the street, holding up signs with 'confessions' written on them. Speaking of the project, Wearing said she had been inspired by the British tendency to bottle up emotion and not reveal secrets. In 1997 she won the Turner Prize for 60 Minutes Silence, a film of uniformed police officers sitting together. Wearing was elected as lifetime member of the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 2007. Roma, 29, mother of four-year-old Kyan, and Emma, 27, mother of Shaye, five, and Isaac, said they have experienced difficult times together and have ‘always been there for each other’. Roma, an outreach worker for a charity, said: ‘We were interested in representing women, representing single parents and also mixed race people, which are such a part of Birmingham. Because there isn’t an adult male... we thought that would be an issue and that’s why possibly we wouldn’t be chosen.’ She added: ‘There’s always the expectation that in future we might be a complete family because perhaps there will be a male there. But I don’t see it like that. We’re women, we support each other and obviously we’ve got the males there – our sons. Potentially they are going to be fathers in the future.’ The sisters and their brothers, Robin, 25, and Jay, 23, were raised by their mother, Karen Jones, a single parent, in a council house in Birmingham. Neighbours described the four siblings as ‘polite and well-brought up’, but said their mother, Miss Jones, was somewhat aloof. One couple who knew the family well said: ‘Karen never used to let anybody in the house. The two daughters would visit with their children almost daily. Occasionally, one of the women would drive round with her boyfriend. But while the daughter went in to see Karen, the boyfriend would always stay in the car.’ Another neighbour, who also declined to be identified, said: ‘The sisters both seem to be devoted parents raising happy and well-rounded children. But Birmingham has tried hard in recent years to position itself in a positive light and this statue sends the wrong message. This is the UK’s second city, and while it is diverse, I don’t know of any modern family made up of two single mothers who are also sisters.’ Karen Jones’s mother Myra Chipman, 70, who also lives in Birmingham, said: ‘I’m proud that my granddaughters have been chosen as the faces of Birmingham. They are lovely girls who have been raised the right way.’ Miss Wearing, who won the Turner Prize in 1997 and is the partner of artist Michael Landy, said: ‘A nuclear family is one reality but it is one of many and this work celebrates the idea that what constitutes a family should not be fixed.’ Her previous statue of a family stands in Trento, Italy. The new sculpture, which stands outside the Library of Birmingham and was commissioned by the city’s Ikon gallery, was made in China and financed by a mixture of public money and private donations.","Gillian Wearing invited Birmingham residents to nominate the most 'real' family in the city to be immortalised .

"A heartbroken girlfriend took her own life four months after her boyfriend drowned while the pair were on a round the world trip together, an inquest has ruled. Kate Downey, 30, was found dead in a room at Newcastle International Airport’s Premier Inn on March 15, just months after boyfriend John-Paul Conley drowned while the pair were on holiday. An inquest into Miss Downey’s death at Newcastle Coroner’s Court has ruled she died as a result of suffocation. The coroner concluded she committed suicide and intended to take her own life. Scroll down for video . An inquest has ruled that Kate Downey, 30, committed suicide in a room at Newcastle International Airport's Premier Inn four months after boyfriend John-Paul Conley drowned while the pair were on holiday . Archeologist Miss Downey and Mr Conley, a docker at Teesside docks, had both taken a year out from their jobs in order to go travelling. The pair had been in Laos, in south-east Asia, for just a few days when Mr Conley was swept away while swimming in a river on the island of Don Khone. Rescue workers launched a search operation for 35-year-old from Linthorpe, Middlesbrough, aided by £30,000 raised by his family back home to pay for boats and helicopters. After four days his body was found washed up on one of the beaches further downriver. Speaking at the time, Miss Downey’s brother Lee, 35, said his sister 'was understandably devastated.' John-Paul Conley, 35, a docker from Teesside docks, died after being swept away while swimming in a river on the island of Don Khone, in Laos . Hundreds of tributes flooded in for Miss Downey, a former Nunthorpe School pupil, when the news of her death spread. 'Hope you have found your Shangri-La, having the next great adventure with Jonny. RIP our beautiful sister xxx,' her brother said. Many other tributes were also paid on Facebook, with one person saying: 'Such another tragic loss for the families and friends of them both. Thoughts and prayers to you all and may they both now rest in peace together.' Another wrote: 'When two people are in love and do so many things together they have a few sad times but so so many happy times. 'If they are parted through tragedy the one left living can feel so much pain inside we all can’t see as tears will hide. 'If they feel that they can’t go on we can’t imagine the pain of there broken heart only that they need to be together once again.' The inquest was held last Thursday.

"ESPN college football analyst Ed Cunningham believes that Johnny Manziel could become an elite-level NFL quarterback, but also fears for his safety. The rookie from Texas A&M was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in May, and Cunningham thinks Manziel has all the tools to make it right to the very top. Manziel was named back-up to Brian Hoyer by Browns head coach Mike Pettine, but Cunningham, who played college football for Washington before spending five years in the NFL with Arizona and Seattle, thinks the rookie will go from strength to strength. New challenge: Johnny Manziel is set to embark on his rookie year with the Cleveland Browns . He said: 'It's all about if he can survive physically because I think Johnny Manziel is a terrific quarterback and people don't give him enough credit for how well he throws the ball and how accurate he can be. 'He has incredible work-rate. If you don't have the work ethic you won't break through, but he does. He is a really hard-working guy who enjoys working on his craft. 'My concern for the young man is that he is going to get a lot of injuries that will add up because the season is so long in the NFL. I think he is good enough to be an elite-level quarterback but I wonder if his body is going to hold up.' Manziel has been under the microscope this summer for his partying and off-field behaviour and admitted to a 'rookie mistake'. Spotlight: The former Texas A&M quarterback was selected in the first round of the 2014 draft . During a pre-season game against the Washington Redskins, Manziel was seen showing his middle finger to the opposition bench. But Cunningham said: 'I enjoyed my NFL life as a single guy with a lot of money in my pocket living in Scottsdale, Arizona so it is hard for me to comdemn him. I would have pulled him aside and had a very stern conversation - but that's what my locker room was like. 'The term I like to use for people like Johnny is that they have to have their jersey a bit dirty before they're ready to compete. He is the guy who had to engage his opponent in he theatrics rather than just playing. The problem is the NFL is full of people who were the best player at their college. I played five years in the NFL and, with the level of the hits, I fear for his safety.' Manziel threw 63 touchdown passes during his time at Texas A&M and won college football's prestigious Heisman Trophy in 2012. Revolution: The new college football season sees the introduction of a play-off system . The college football season began on Thursday night and the best teams in America will battle for a place in the National Championship game at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. This season also sees the introduction of a new play-off system, where four teams will enter a semi-finals and final bracket, replacing the former BCS method where the top two teams were selected for the National Championship game. 'The play-off is something this sport has probably needed for a long time. For the players, fans and coaches, this is a really historic season that we finally have a play-off. 'We will now more closely find the true champion of our spot because the truth is we haven't always been very accurate or very good at that.'

"Mum was definitely not the word when it came to this new arrival. New father Aidan McManus live tweeted the birth of his son Finn all over the internet, while clutching wife Tracy's hand in one hand and his iPhone in the other. The project manager documented before, during and after the Caesarian delivery, posting Instagram photos to his Twitter account as it happened. Aidan McManus posted the progress throughout birth of baby son on Instagram and Twitter . Mr McManus first started taking iPhone snaps while he and his wife were waiting to go to the delivery suite . 'From taking each photo, applying a filter, writing the caption and tweeting it probably took about 20 seconds so I was able to get them straight out there for people to see,' explains Mr McManus. The couple, who live in Crosby, Merseyside, had baby Finn at Ormskirk General Hospital. They already have a four-year-old daughter Isobel and it was her birth, says 32-year-old Mr McManus, which first prompted his photography hobby. 'I realised there wasn't a lot of decent quality photos of the big occasion then, so this time round I did see it as part of my role to capture the event. 'We didn't really discuss it beforehand, but I am a huge Twitter user and I got the idea because I know a couple of people who have tweeted their weddings; the groom has been standing at the altar tweeting away discreetly, although I don't know anyone who's done it for a birth before.' Booked in for an elective Caesarian, Mr McManus first started taking iPhone snaps while he and his wife were waiting to go to the delivery suite. 'Because we were a non-emergency procedure, there was a few hours of hanging around and all the anticipation and the nerves were building up,' he smiles. The project manager documented before, during and after the Caesarian delivery of his son Finn . Mr McManus posted eight photos from when they arrived until they left with Finn all tucked up in his little hat and gloves . Now the family and their friends will always have the unique montage to look back on and remember. Pictured here with the baby is the couple's daughter Isobel . 'I had my phone with me and also my proper camera so I was taking better quality photos with that, but I didn't have the ability to share those instantly. They went onto a memory card to be uploaded when we got home. 'But the beauty of Instagram, which is a photo sharing site, is you have a Twitter option built in so it was easy to just snap away and then tweet the links.' Given that she was busy with the job of giving birth, Mr McManus says his wife left it to his discretion about what images were taken and what were shared with his hundreds of followers. Mr McManus said: 'There was a few hours of hanging around and all the anticipation and the nerves were building up' Mr McManus started tweeting at 9am and carried on until 11.30am, after the baby was born . 'She didn't give me any rules or dos and don'ts, but in the end there were a lot more graphic photos I wasn't willing share,' he laughs. Mr McManus says he was careful to ensure that the actual arrival, and most importantly the mother-to-be, weren't forgotten in his eagerness to capture the event. 'I made sure Tracy never felt neglected, of course,' he adds, 'although since I've become a keen amateur photographer she's quite used to having a camera pointed at her now.' Over the 30 hours the couple and Isobel were in hospital, Mr McManus posted eight photos from when they arrived until they left with Finn all tucked up in his little hat and gloves. Now the family and their friends will always have the unique montage to look back on and remember. So, does Mr McManus intend to whip out his iPhone for another special occasion? 'We're not planning any more children but I'd definitely do it again,' he laughs. 'Maybe for the christening...'","Aidan McManus, from Crosby, posted pictures of son on Instagram .

"A three-year-old girl was killed by a bulldozer as her family attempted to block construction crews from 'forcibly flattening' their land, it has been claimed. Hong Xiaorou died under the tracks of the construction vehicle next to her home in Zhangzhou, in the southeastern province of Fujian, China. Her family were in the middle of a dispute over the acquisition of their land and claimed they were attempting to stop building workers from flattening it when the girl died. Horrific: A three-year-old girl was killed by a bulldozer as her family attempted to block construction crews from 'forcibly flattening' their land, it has been claimed. This is a file picture of a bulldozer destroying a home . Her father Hong Bingsheng said 'I asked an official from the demolition team: ""What is more important -- human life or land acquisition? The official replied: ""Land acquisition is more important"".' Xiaorou's family took her body to a local government office to protest to officials. Images posted on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter, showed a toddler lying on a table in what appeared to be an office, badly bruised with blood pouring from her head as a woman cried at her side. The family has been negotiating compensation over the acquisition of their land, Mr Hong said. Such talks between residents and developers are common across China as the country undergoes rapid urbanisation. Mr Hong claimed workers were planning to target their . own property at a later stage. 'We live in the developing zone and they wanted to acquire our land. We haven't settled a compensation agreement, and they killed my daughter with a bulldozer,' he said. Local officials and police denied the family home was being targeted by developers. 'There's no demolition. Yes, the girl died. But she was accidentally killed by the bulldozer when they were flattening the (adjacent) land as she sneaked into the building site and played there,' said an official at the Zhangpu district office, declining to give her name. A police officer surnamed Chen said: 'The developer was flattening the land and the family of this girl were afraid their land was going to be affected because they are next door.' China's rapid urbanisation can see entire villages uprooted to make way for industry and housing developments -- often with the help of corrupt officials and police. A series of regulations have been passed by legislators in recent years to protect land rights, including outlawing the use of violence during evictions and stipulating market rate compensation must be paid to relocated residents. British-based rights group Amnesty International has said violent forced evictions are increasing in China, with evictees sometimes beaten, imprisoned, or even killed at the hands of authorities.","Hong Xiaorou died under the tracks of .

"Genetics will determine whether a person infected with Ebola dies, scientists  claimed today. A new study has found DNA could be the key to tracking the deadly effects of the virus which has ravaged West Africa. The World Health Organisation revealed nearly 5,000 people have died from the disease, which has devastated Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. A team of scientists at Washington University believe their study has identified genetic factors behind the mild-to-deadly range of reactions to the virus. Genetics will determine whether a person infected with Ebola dies, scientists have today claimed. Pictured, a member of a burial team in Monrovia, Liberia is sprayed with disinfectant . A new study, carried out by the University of Washington, has found DNA could be the key to tracking the deadly effects of the virus which has ravaged West Africa . Some people exposed to the virus completely resist the disease. Others suffer moderate to severe illness and recover, while those most susceptible succumb to bleeding, organ failure and shock. Past studies of people who have contracted Ebola found these differences are not related to any specific changes in the virus itself, making it more or less dangerous. Instead the body's attempts to fight infection seems to determine the severity of the disease. Researchers believe their new findings could accelerate vital drug and vaccine development, reflecting the diversity of reactions to the virus. The study examined how the disease affects mice. Study leaders Angela Rasmussen and Michael Katze said research on Ebola has to date been hampered by the lack of a mouse model that replicates the main characteristics of human Ebola. Their study was conducted in a highly secure, state-of-the-art biocontainment lab in Montana. The scientists examined mice that they infected with a mouse form of the same species of the Ebola virus responsible for the current West African outbreak. Conventional lab mice previously infected with the strain of virus died, but did not develop symptoms of the disease. In the new study, researchers noted all the mice lost weight in the first few days after infection. However, nearly one in five (19 per cent) not only survived, but also fully regained their lost weight within two weeks. They showed no signs of having any gross pathological evidence of disease and their livers appeared normal. One in nine of the mice (11 per cent) were found to be partially resistant and less than half of them died. The World Health Organisation revealed nearly 5,000 people have died from the disease, pictured under the microscope, which has devastated Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone . Seventy per cent of the mice had a greater than 50 per cent mortality, with 19 per cent of this last group suffering liver inflammation despite not showing the classic symptoms of the virus. Source: cdc.gov/Includes AP text . A third had blood that took too long to clot - a hallmark of fatal Ebola in humans. Those mice also suffered internal bleeding, swollen spleens and changes in liver colour and texture. Dr Rasmussen said: 'The frequency of different manifestations of the disease across the lines of these mice screened so far are similar in variety and proportion to the spectrum of clinical disease observed in the 2014 West African outbreak.' While acknowledging that recent Ebola survivors may have had immunity to this or a related virus that saved them during this epidemic, Dr Katze said: 'Our data suggest that genetic factors play a significant role in disease outcome.' Dr Katze said that, in general, when virus infection frenzied the genes involved in promoting blood vessel inflammation and cell death, serious or fatal disease followed. However, survivors experienced more activity in genes that order blood vessel repair and the production of infection-fighting white blood cells. He added: 'We hope that medical researchers will be able to rapidly apply these findings to candidate therapeutics and vaccines.' The researchers believe their mouse model can be rapidly implemented to find genetic markers, leading to studies to examine how symptoms originate and take hold. They hope to evaluate drugs and broad spectrum anti-viral activites against all strains of the Ebola virus, including that responsible for the current West African epidemic. The study was published in the journal Science. Researchers believe their new findings could accelerate vital drug and vaccine development, reflecting the diversity of reactions to the virus . Professor of Virology at Warwick University, Andrew Easton said the paper demonstrates that genes do play a role in determining the outcome of Ebola. 'This is not surprising as similar observations have been made for many viruses,' he said. 'The paper shows that the precise cells infected and extent of Ebola virus replication is, in part, determined by the host genes. 'Most of these genes are involved in the very earliest stages of our immune response to infection, again an observation seen with other viruses. 'While this is valuable information the date in the paper cannot be directly extrapolated to the human situation and used as a basis for potential therapy at the moment, as, unlike the mice used in the study, humans are extensively outbred and have a large variety of genetic combinations, making assessment of the impact of the genes in humans difficult. The scientists examined mice that they infected with a mouse form of the same species of the Ebola virus responsible for the current West African outbreak . Children orphaned in Meliandou, Guinea, their families claimed by the deadly virus . 'The paper does not assess the role of environmental factors that undoubtedly also play a role in the disease process such as the underlying health status of the at-risk population. Professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, Jonathan Ball, added: 'We know that host genetics influences infection outcome for a range of viruses, like HIV and norovirus. We've also suspected that genetics plays a role in susceptibility to Ebola virus infection. 'In the current mouse model study, the finding that levels of expression of a gene involved in coagulation differs between mice showing different severity of disease symptoms is really intriguing. 'Of course, this is merely an association and needs to be explored more to know definitively how expression is controlled and how it might influence disease. It will also be important to see if a similar phenomenon is happening in humans . 'It's a reminder of how infectious diseases shape the evolution of a host; and the human host is no different to any other.'","Study in mice suggests genetic factors are behind mild-to-deadly range of reactions to the Ebola virus .

"A cousin of Prince Philip has launched an astonishing attack on Princess Diana by accusing her of being 'spiteful' and 'unkind' towards Prince Charles. Lady Pamela Hicks, who is the first cousin to Prince Philip, also said the ill-fated marriage 'absolutely destroyed' Prince Charles but said he had since blossomed again. She also claimed Diana had no feelings for the rest of the Royal Family and did not wish to integrate herself into Royal life, instead preferring to listen to music and go to discos. The daughter of Lord Mountbatten said Princess Diana did not try with her fellow Royals because she knew that the public admired her and claimed Diana believed 'she was the star'.

But she said Diana did not want to be told anything and instead wanted to listen to music and go to discos and concerts. During the wide-ranging interview, Lady Hicks  - who has previously spoken about the recent history of the Royal family - also talks about the first signs of romance between the Queen and Prince Philip. Outspoken: Prince Charles and Princess Diana married at St Paul's Cathedral on July 29, 1981. Lady Hicks says Prince Charles has 'blossomed again' following his divorce . She told Vanity Fair that she had long . known about a young Elizabeth’s crush on Philip and that the future . Queen had first set eyes on her future husband at the age of 13 when she . visited Dartmouth Naval College with . her parents. But Lady Hicks claimed when Princess Elizabeth reached a suitable age, the King . and Queen were 'appalled' by the idea and instead wanted her to marry a 'respectable English duke.' She claims one of the reasons was because a young Prince Philip had no money. Insight: Lady Pamela Hicks is known for her revelations about the recent history of the Royal Family . During the interview , Lady Hick's older sister Patricia, Countess Mountbatten of Burma, also speaks about Prince Philip. They admit he has never been one to flatter but say he more sensitive . than people imagine. Lady Hicks has previously told of the moment the Press caught their first glimpse of a budding romance between a young Queen and Prince Philip. She said: 'I was present when the world got the first inkling of their love for each other. 'It was my older sister Patricia’s wedding in October 1946, at which I was one of the bridesmaids, and the ceremony was at Romsey Abbey in Hampshire, close to our family home at Broadlands. It poured non-stop that day. 'When they reached the door of the Abbey, Princess Elizabeth turned to Philip and he casually reached over and took her coat. 'The watching Press glimpsed an air of ease and understanding between the pair, and royal gossip went into overdrive.' Speaking before, Lady Pamela has told of her  mother Edwina's relationship with other men during her marriage to Lord Mountbatten . Writing in a memoir,  Lady Pamela said she  saw nothing untoward at first in her mother’s string of male friends. But in time, the ‘eccentricity’ of her family life would inevitably be a source of bewilderment and sadness. She wrote that her mother's excuse for cavalier behaviour was that she was lonely. ‘My father’s naval duties often took him away, so she became increasingly reliant on admirers for entertainment.’ Outspoken: The daughters of Lord Mountbatten also claim the Queen's parents were initially 'appalled' over the idea of her marrying Prince Philip, instead wishing she would marry a respectable English duke . Eccentric family: Lady Pamela is pictured . right with her mother Edwina, Lord Mountbatten and sister Patricia . She called them her ‘ginks’, a slang . word for ‘guys’, and she loved the thrill of being chased by them. ‘She . began to collect them in a way that raised many eyebrows,’ Lady Pamela said. ‘Of course, the . ramifications were messy and complex. When my father first heard that . she had taken a lover, he was devastated. But eventually, using their . reserves of deep mutual affection, my parents managed to negotiate a way . through this crisis and found a modus vivendi.’ Princess Diana married  Prince Charles on July 29, 1981 at St Paul's Cathedral. They had two sons, the princes William and Harry, before the couple divorced on 28 August 1996.

"In an era where airlines rarely offer complimentary peanuts anymore, it's surprising that a captain would go out of his way to feed passengers on a delayed flight. But that's just what one unnamed Frontier Airlines pilot did this week when he reached into his own wallet to pay for a round of pizzas. The kind act happened on a flight from Washington, D.C. Monday night, bound for Denver. Frontier Airlines flight 719 was scheduled to leave at 5:48pm, according to FlightAware.com, but didn't leave the tarmac until nearly an hour later. Scroll down for video . Cool pilot: The captain of a flight from Washington, D.C. to Denver that was delayed five hours on Monday, bought his hungry passengers a round of pizzas as they waited on the tarmac after being diverted to Cheyenne, Wyoming . And the flight only went downhill from there. As the plane approached the Denver area, they ran into a severe thunderstorm and the captain was forced to circle around the western Nebraska until the storm cleared. But when the plane started to run low on fuel, it diverted to the airport in Cheyenne, Wyoming to wait out the bad weather. After about an hour on the tarmac, the passengers were starting to get agitated in the hot Airbus A320. Off to a bad start: The plane was scheduled to leave Washington at 5:48pm but didn't leave the airport until nearly an hour later . His own money: When the plane was diverted to Cheyenne because of bad weather in Denver, the pilot decided to buy 50 pizzas for the entire flight . Hungry no more: Passenger Logan Marie Torres, who is also Miss Colorado United States Teen 2014, took pictures of the flight crew handing out the much-appreciated pizzas . That's when the captain realized that neither he nor the passengers had ate in quite a long time. 'The captain took his own initiative,' passenger Logan Marie Torres, and also Miss Colorado United States Teen 2014,  told KDVR.   'He said “Ladies and gentleman, Frontier Airlines is known for being one of the cheapest airlines in the US, but your captain is not cheap. I just ordered pizza for the entire plane.”' The captain ordered 50 pizzas which were handed out to the appreciative passengers by the flight crew. Miss Torres took several pictures of the flight attendants bringing the pizza boxes through the cabin to passengers with smiles on their faces. The plane remained on the ground in Cheyenne for about two hours before finally taking off for Denver, arriving just before midnight - five hours late. So far the captain of flight 719 has not been named, and MailOnline's calls to the airline have not been returned.","A Monday night plane from Washington, D.C. to Denver, Colorado was delayed by more than five hours .

"Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard heaped praise on debutant striker Mario Balotelli, insisting he could fire the club to the title this season. The mercurial striker played an hour up front for Liverpool, linking up well with fellow striker Daniel Sturridge during the comprehensive 3-0 victory over Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Sunday. The Italian didn’t find the net for Liverpool, missing a few decent chances, but Gerrard was delighted with his new colleague’s efforts: . VIDEO Scroll down to see Rodgers say it was  first time Balotelli ever marked at a corner . Winners: Raheem Sterling posted on his Instagram a picture of a very pleased Liverpool squad after their win . ‘I thought he was terrific today. All eyes were on him today, people were wondering whether he’ll work hard for us, whether he would hold the ball up for us. But for an hour he was terrific today. ‘If he plays like that for us all season then he could be the difference for whether we compete for the title. ‘I’ve only worked with him for a week but he’s has been terrific since he came in. He works hard and he will only improve with a manger like Brendan Rodgers.’ Excellent: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers congratulates Mario Balotelli after an 'excellent' debut . Star performance: England forward Raheem Sterling put Liverpool ahead after just eight minutes . Instant impact: Sterling put Liverpool on their way to an impressive 3-0 victory at White Hart Lane . Similarly Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was pleased with Balotelli’s impact: . ‘I though he was excellent with his stature upfront. He had moments of real quality’ said Rodgers. ‘But today is about the team. Mario was part of that for his hour and was excellent.’ Rodgers has now managed 56 wins from his first 100 Liverpool matches, the same amount as legendary boss Bill Shankly and Rafa Benitez. Debut: Mario Balotelli made a successful debut for Liverpool but could have scored with several chances . Tough day: Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor missed a fantastic chance for Spurs in the first-half . After the 3-0 win at White Hart Lane, Rodgers was evidently pleased with the all-round performance: . ‘I think everything that could have been good was there. We defended strong and played out diamond so well for 60 minutes. ‘We were a constant threat in between the lines and the two boys up top were excellent.

"Sex therapist Dr. Shirley Zussman has just turned 100 years old, and the bedroom-related issues she treats today are markedly different from those she did when she started out in the Swinging Sixties. 'The biggest problem now is a lack of desire,' she tells Time. 'And I’m shocked at the lack of connection between people because of iPhones - even though I love my iPhone! There is so much less of actual physical connection.' Dr. Zussman, who still practices in New York, adds: 'You have to look at your priorities. We need touching to make us feel wanted . and loved. That’s lacking so much in this generation. Lack . of looking, lack of touching, lack of smiling. I don’t get it. I don’t . get how people aren’t missing that, and don’t seem to think they are.' Scroll down for video . Sexpert: Dr. Shirley Zussman (pictured) has just turned 100, and has been a sex therapist since the Sixties. 'The biggest problem now is a lack of desire,' she says, blaming our busy lives and our iPhone fixations . Dr. Zussman was born at the start of World War I and graduated from Smith college in 1934, in the same class as revolutionary chef Julia Child, no less. Her gynecologist husband performed one of the first legal abortions in New York. She started working as a sex therapist at a time when a sudden need sprung forth - just as the birth control pill was legalized. Back then, she says, sex was a good deal more 'frantic' than it is today. She recalls the race to see and feel everything, because sex was no longer just about having babies, it was about 'pleasure.' Back then, a lot of women came to Dr. Zussman because . they found they couldn't reach orgasm, for which she generally . prescribed exploratory masturbation. 'Lack of looking, lack of touching, lack . of smiling...  I don’t get how people aren’t missing that, . and don’t seem to think they are' These . days, however, she sees a lot of people for whom masturbation is . actually the cause of sexual problems; particularly men, and . particularly as a result of the internet porn explosion. 'I . see that a lot in some single men who don’t make the effort to go out . in the world to face the issues, face the possible rejection,' she . remarks. 'They satisfy their sexual needs sitting in front of the . computer and masturbating.' A generation of porn-addicts: A lot of Dr Zussman's male patients today don't get out into the 'real world' to risk facing rejection. 'They satisfy their sexual needs sitting in front of the computer and masturbating,' she says . On the cultural transition of 'casual sex' from the Sixties to now, she points to the AIDS crisis of the Eighties as one of the factors which slowed us down and encouraged a more measured approach to sex. But do we now make love too little? Dr. Zussman claims that between the rat race of our busy careers and our non-stop push for attaining 'more' on every level, we are often literally too 'exhausted' to get it on with our partners. Still, she may specialize in sex - or the lack thereof - but Dr Zussman maintains that at the end of the day, no matter what generation we live in, our bedroom antics don't trump all. 'Sexual pleasure is just one part of what men and women want from each other,' she states. 'They want intimacy, they want closeness, they want understanding, they want fun, and they want someone who really cares about them beyond just going to bed with them.'","Dr. Shirley Zussman has been practicing since the Swinging Sixties, when sex was 'frantic'

"Michelle Snyder is leaving CMS after presiding over the failed Obamacare website launch . Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Chief Operating Officer Michelle Snyder is on her way out after 41 years working for the federal government, but she won't leave without absorbing some final slings and arrows from critics of the Affordable Care Act. Rep. Darrell Issa, the hard-charging conservative Republican who chairs the House Oversight Committee, criticized Michelle Snyder on Monday for 'bypassing the recommendation of CMS' top security expert' before green-lighting the October 1 launch of healthcare.gov. Those experts, Issa said in a statement, recommended a delay 'after independent testers raised concern about serious vulnerabilities from a lack of adequate security testing.' 'Americans seeking health insurance,' he added, 'are left to shoulder the risk of a website that's still an all-around work in progress because of the cult like commitment officials had to the arbitrary goal of launching on October 1.' CMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner announced Snyder's retirement Monday, saying that he had planned to leave a year ago but stayed an extra 12 months at Tavenner's request to 'help me with the challenges facing CMS in 2013.' The federal government's main Obamacare website was built at a cost that is now approaching $677 million, through contracts with technology companies that reported to Snyder. As the chronically troubled website is re-worked and its near-comical rollout enters its salvage phase, that role will now fall to Snyder's deputy, Tim Love, who will take on her job on an 'acting' basis. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Healthcare.gov has been plagued with crashes, data security problems and a failure to handle large volumes of traffic -- and Snyder has attracted much of the blame . A former CMS official told The New York Times that Snyder was expected to depart following healthcare.gov's disastrous implementation. 'She . had to go,' the official said. 'She was responsible for the . implementation of Obamacare. She controlled all the resources to get it . done. She was in charge of information technology. She controlled . personnel and budget.' Technically speaking, no one has been fired – or asked to resign – over Obamacare's flawed public introduction. By . contrast, President Obama asked for the resignation of the Internal . Revenue Service's acting director in May after a controversy erupted . over the agency's partisan use of the tax code to target politically . conservative nonprofit organizations. Meanwhile, five time zones away ... President Obama vacations in Hawaii as his healthcare team takes a hit with Snyder's sudden departure . During an October 30 congressional . hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius blamed . Snyder for the epidemic of website crashes that accompanied the rollout, . but moments later insisted that she herself should bear responsibility. In . a heated exchange with Tennessee Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn, . Sebelius named Snyder as the CMS official who was in charge of the . website's building phase. 'Michelle Snyder is the one responsible for this debacle?' Blackburn demanded to know. 'Well, excuse me, congresswoman,' came Sebelius' answer. 'Michelle Snyder is not responsible for the debacle. Hold me accountable for the debacle. I'm responsible.' In the following weeks, Sebelius and other Obama administration officials shifted the blame to contractors including CGI Federal, the highest-dollar recipient of taxpayer funds allocated to the project. Snyder is the second official to step down from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a sub-agency of HHS, since Obamacare's rocky start. CMS Chief Information Officer Tony Trenkle left in November to take a private sector job. HHS released a report just weeks ago that blamed 'inadequate management oversight and coordination among technical teams' for the healthcare.gov debacle. In response, Jeffrey Zients the . management guru tapped to resolve the project's outstanding problems, . told reporters in a conference call that he believed 'healthcare.gov was . fixable if we made significant changes to the management approach.' Those . changes included naming an outside company – one of the same firms . involved with the site's failed early construction – as its overall . quarterback, or 'systems integrator,' removing that role from Snyder's . office. Rep. Darrell Issa slammed Snyder for enforcing a 'cult like' obsession with opening up healthcare.gov to the public when it was not yet ready for action . During a congressional hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius named Snyder as the top official at the helm of the failed website project, but fell on a rhetorical grenade by insisting that she herself was most to blame . The website has functioned better in recent weeks, and HHS boasted over the weekend that 1.1 million Americans had enrolled in health plans through its federal-level insurance marketplace. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia run their own exchanges, likely adding hundreds of thousands more to that total. But Washington's own projections called for 3.3 million by year's end, putting the White House on a pace to reach just one-third of its overall goal of 7 million by March 31. But the administration's latest statement provided no hint about how many – or how few – enrollees have paid premiums. Additionally, there has been no word from insurers about how many of them will be covered on January 1. Among healthcare.gov's systemic problems is a back-end processing glitch that has garbled some records on their way to insurers and left others unsent entirely.","Michelle Snyder is voluntarily stepping down from her role at the top of the healthcare.gov food chain .

"As warrior Queen Boudicca and her army advanced on the town of Colchester  almost 2,000 years ago, a terrified Roman woman stashed her most valuable possessions in the ground. This is the belief of archaeologists who have unearthed one of the finest collections of Roman ‘bling’ stashed in a ‘clutch bag’ under what is now the Essex town’s High Street. The hoard includes gold armlets, earrings and rings as well as silver chains, rings and coins, and was buried in bags and a wooden box under the floor of a house. Archaeologists who have unearthed one of the finest collections of Roman ‘bling’ stashed in a ‘clutch bag’ under what is now Colchester High Street. The hoard (pictured) includes gold armlets, earrings and rings as well as silver chains, rings and coins, and was buried in bags and a wooden box under the floor of a house . The owner of the jewellery is unknown, but she may have been killed in a ‘sacred grove’ – a fate which befell  wealthy Roman women captured by the Iceni army. Dr Philip Crummy, director of the Colchester Archaeological Trust described the find as ‘of national importance and one of the finest ever uncovered in Britain.’ ‘We had almost finished our six-month study of the site when we came upon a small tangled ball of metal that turned out to be jewellery that had lain there undisturbed since 61AD,’ he said. Archeologists think that the jewellery was buried by a terrified Roman woman as warrior Queen Boudicca (pictured as a statue) and her army advanced on the town of Colchester, almost 2,000 years ago . The impressive collection of  jewellery was discovered by the Williams & Griffin department store on the High Street in Colchester (marked) and it's hoped more treasure could be found nearby . The Roman owner of the jewellery (pictured left and right) is unknown, but she may have been killed in a ‘sacred grove’ – a fate which befell Roman wealthy women captured by the army . The Boudiccan Revolt raged from 60-61AD and saw British tribes, under Boudicca of the Iceni, unsuccessfully try to defeat the Roman army. Boudicca was Queen of the Iceni people, a British tribe who lived in what is today Norfolk and parts of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. Her name is an early for of the more commonly known name 'Victoria'. Her husband, Prasutagus, was ruler of the Iceni people, and the Romans allowed Prasutagus to continue as king, ruling on their behalf. But, when Prasutagus died, the Romans decided to rule the Iceni directly and they confiscated the property of the leading Iceni families. The Romans are also said to have stripped and whipped Boudicca, and raped her daughters. The revolt resulted in Camulodunum, now Colchester, London, and Verulamium, now St Albans, being burnt to the ground while thousands of people on both sides lost their lives. Colchester was the first target of the Boudiccan army and many of the townspeople were rounded up and sacrificed in nearby groves. Source: The British Museum .

Her name is an early for of the more commonly known name 'Victoria'. The Boudiccan Revolt saw British tribes, under Boudicca of the Iceni, unsuccessfully try to defeat the Roman army. The revolt resulted in Camulodunum, now Colchester, London, and Verulamium, now St Albans, being burnt to the ground while thousands of people on both sides lost their lives. Dr Crummy said: ‘It is a particularly poignant find because of its historical context - Boudicca and her army destroyed London and St Albans but many of the inhabitants had time to escape however the people of Colchester were not so fortunate. ‘They knew a large Roman army was coming to their aid but they were practically defenceless, with only a small force of soldiers and no town defences. ‘Imagine their panic and desperation when they learnt of the massacre of a large part of the Ninth Legion on its way to relieve them and after a two-day siege they were over-run.’ He explained that they would have tried desperately to bury and hide valuables like jewellery for safe-keeping. ‘We know that the “noblest” of Colchester’s Roman women were taken to sacred groves, where they were killed in a horrific way and the quality of the jewellery we have found suggests that the owner would have been in this category but there is no direct evidence to indicate she ended up in a sacred grove.’ The Boudiccan sacking and burning of Colchester left in its wake a distinctive red and black layer of debris up to half a metre thick across the centre of much of modern-day Colchester. The Boudiccan sacking and burning of Colchester left in its wake a distinctive red and black layer of debris up to half a metre thick across the centre of much of modern-day Colchester (pictured left). This layer  is still being examined by archaeologists on the site, which is part of the Williams & Griffin department store (right) A bone belonging of a Roman victim of the Iceni rebels, was found during redevelopment of a department store in Colchester in July. The jawbone dates back to around 60AD, and was unearthed among burnt building debris under the town’s High Street. It is only the second time remains of this kind have been found in the region. An archaeologist said that the bones must be the remains of people who died in buildings set on fire by the British as they quickly overran the town. This layer – made up for burned clay walls - is still being examined by archaeologists on the site, which is part of the Williams & Griffin department store. They explained that human remains are rarely found among such debris, but the latest excavation has already yielded part of a jaw and shin bone, which appear to have been cut by a heavy, sharp implement such as a sword. Experts think that there could have been resistance from the beleaguered garrison at the site. Dr Crummy said: ‘We also discovered food on the floor of the room in which the jewellery was found, including dates, figs, wheat, peas and grain.’ He thinks it may have been stored on a wooden shelf, which had collapsed on to the floor. Archaeologists expect to find more artefacts. The jewellery is now in a secure laboratory where it is being cleaned. The fate of the hoard lies with the Coroner who will rule if the jewellery is treasure or not.

"Radiation from a stricken Japanese nuclear power station could have reached a potentially lethal point - prompting fears that its operator is struggling to maintain safety. Radiation readings of 1,800 millisieverts (mSv) per hour  - 18 times the level at the same spot 10 days ago - have been detected at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant. A dose this size of gamma radiation is high enough to kill a human exposed to it within four hours. The revelations come after Japan's top nuclear regulator today raised . safety concerns about hastily built storage tanks and their . foundations amid signs of more leaks of radiation-contaminated water. Worrying: Radiation from a Japanese nuclear power station could have reached a potentially lethal point. This image shows Japanese Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Toshimitsu Motegi, in red helmet, inspecting contamination water tanks at Fukushima last week . Concerns: Japan's top nuclear regulator raised safety concerns today about hastily built storage tanks and their foundations amid signs of more leaks of radiation-contaminated water . Nuclear Regulation Authority Chairman . Shunichi Tanaka said that a small leak and signs of possible leaks have . been spotted at several other Fukushima Dai-ichi storage tanks since a . major leak in August which added to concerns about the plant's stability. The new revelations will add to the increasing anger in Japan over the management of the disaster by the owner of the plant, Tokyo Electric Power Company. There are increasing fears that news of more  leaks from the plant could affect Tokyo's bid for the 2020 Olympic Games which will be decided next Saturday. A meeting about the leaks was . postponed by Japanese MPs last week until after the decision by the . International Olympic Committee was to be made. This has prompted . allegations of a cover-up. Following the latest worrying radiation readings, Tepco claimed last night that the radiation contained only 1mSv of gamma rays, The Times reported. The firm said beta radiation, which is weaker, made up the rest of the radiation readings. Wrecked: This aerial view shows the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station in 2011 . But Dr Richard Wakeford, a professor at Manchester University, told the newspaper that ratio would be 'most unusual', adding: 'Penetrating gamma rays would be lethal in a few hours.' The plant's operator reported a loss of 300 tons of radiation-contaminated water from a steel tank on August 19, saying most of it is believed to have seeped underground but some might have escaped into the sea. The company has yet to determine the cause or exactly where the water went. The massive leak of water used to cool the plant's three melted reactor cores triggered fears of similar leaks from more than 300 other similar tanks. The tanks are part of approximately 1,000 tanks holding 330,000 tons of contaminated water at the plant, where the radioactive waste water from the reactors grows by 400 tons daily. Dangerous: Workers spray water to cool down the spent nuclear fuel in the fourth reactor building at Fukushima in 2011 . The latest leaks have triggered further concerns about the plant's ability to manage the contaminated water. Experts have said that radiation-contaminated water leaking from underground and utility tunnels connected to reactors and turbine buildings has been leaking into the sea for some time. Tanaka said he believed the discoveries of the subsequent leak and signs of possible leaks were the result of closer inspections after a leak two weeks ago. That leak was the worst from a tank at the plant, where three reactors melted down following the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Tanaka raised concerns about the safety of the foundations of the tank sites. TEPCO recently revealed that one of the tank sites had partially sunk during a test to see if the tank was watertight. 'Because those tanks were built in an emergency situation, it is questionable whether sufficient ground surveys were conducted,' Tanaka said. 'We believe experienced companies did a fine job, but we still have concerns and we must step up our watch for leaks.' The plant's operator says the latest small leak was found over the weekend at a connecting pipe, and added it suspects possible leaks from at least three other tanks where high radioactivity was detected nearby, although it was not considered deadly. The March 2011 earthquake and tsunami  in Japan destroyed the plant's power and cooling systems, causing three reactor cores to melt and fuel storage pools to overheat. Since then, the plant is now using makeshift systems.","Radiation readings of 1,800 .

"Brendan Rodgers claimed Liverpool are ready for another title challenge after a 3-0 victory at Tottenham on Sunday. Raheem Sterling, Steven Gerrard and Alberto Moreno’s stunning goal was the perfect response at White Hart Lane following their 3-1 setback at Manchester City on Monday. Liverpool were beaten to the Barclays Premier League title by two points last season, but Rodgers is convinced they will compete at the top again. Back to their best: Brendan Rodgers hailed an outstanding performance from Liverpool at White Hart Lane . Approval: Rodgers is happy with what he can see on the pitch as he applauds during their 3-0 win . He said: ‘We have risen to every challenge since we've been here. It was the same last year: will we score enough goals? But this group is really hungry. ‘We lost the game on Monday and it petered away from us in the last 15 minutes, and then come to a team that's started well, but we showed we are a very good side. ‘We played very well and clicked back into where we were last season. That's great to see, and hopefully people enjoyed watching us. ‘We were excellent. This was an outstanding performance. It’s a brilliant win.’ Sterling scored the opening goal for Liverpool from close range after an outstanding pass from Daniel Sturridge down the right before Jordan Henderson's cross found him on the far post. The England forward, who joined up with Roy Hodgson’s squad after the match for the friendly with Norway on Wednesday and next Monday’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland, was outstanding against Spurs. Rodgers added: ‘His run was like Ricky Villa, but his finish was more Ricky Gervais.' ‘He needs to be better on his left foot. He has wonderful skill, he comes inside, but he was caught in two minds for the second chance. Cool finish: Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling scored after just eight minutes at White Hart Lane . Room to improve: Sterling was outstanding, says Rodgers, but has areas where he can get better . ‘I think he was going to toe-poke it first time, and then tried to work it on to his left side. But he was fantastic.’ Gerrard beat Jan Molby’s record of 42 goals from the penalty spot after increasing Liverpool’s lead just after the break. The former England captain said: ‘The challenge for this team for this season is to defend better and I am sure the manager will be buzzing with the clean sheet.’ Moreno got his first goal for Liverpool after a traumatic debut during the 3-1 defeat at the Etihad Stadium on Monday evening. He dispossessed Spurs substitute Andros Townsend before racing down the left to beat Hugo Lloris.

On the spot: (From left) Mario Balotelli, Steven Gerrard and Daniel Sturridge celebrate Gerrard's penalty . Power play: Alberto Moreno (right) is elated after his brilliant solo goal . Rodgers added: ‘He presses Townsend, nicks the ball and then he's away. The speed he showed was phenomenal and it’s a great finish. ‘That's what I ask of the full-backs: defend first, and then attack. He was excellent.’ Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino claimed Liverpool were lucky to be awarded the penalty after Joe Allen’s shirt was held back by Eric Dier. Pochettino said: ‘I’m very disappointed with the result. We had key moments in the game. We conceded the first goal, but we competed well in that first half. We had the one on one, too.

"Way forward: A 'kill switch' could soon be installed in Samsung mobile phones and tablets which would allow the devices to be disabled if they are stolen, it has emerged. This is a file picture of a Samsung phone . A 'kill switch' could soon be installed in Samsung mobile phones and tablets which would allow the devices to be disabled if they are stolen. The new feature would allow the phone manufacturer to disable a stolen device even if a thief had tampered with the machine. It comes after Apple announced last month that its smartphones are to be installed with a similar switch. The authorities in South Korea - which are struggling to cope with an increase in gadget thefts - have asked the country's major technology makes  - including Samsung - to begin installing the feature. Despite users currently being able to lock their screens to prevent strangers from gaining access to devices, thieves can work around this. They often hack into mobile phones to remove the barriers or instead replace SIM cards . A kill switch would allow devices to be disabled by phone operators and manufacturers even if thieves had taken this action. Apple announced last month that the capability will be added as part of the latest iOS update due out in the autumn. And the Mayor of London Boris Johnson is among politicians pushing all phone manufacturers to follow suit and do more to tackle phone theft. There were more than 100,000 'thefts from person' in the UK last year - an 8 per cent increase on 2011. Last month, pop singer Katie Melua had her iPhone 5 ripped from her by muggers as she walked from her Notting Hill studios. Police say the rise has been driven by phone thefts, particularly the recent phenomenon of thieves on bikes snatching handsets from victims as they ride past. In New York, police say so-called 'Apple picking' is the fastest growing crime in the city with 113 devices stolen or lost every minutes across the US. 'Kill Switch': As part of an update to the . operating system and the 'Find My Phone' application, iPhone users will . be able to deactivate their devices online . Boris Johnson has written to the heads . of Apple, Nokia, Samsung, Motorola, HTC, Microsoft, Blackberry and Sony . demanding action, according to the Financial Times. His officials met with their counterparts in New York recently to share ideas on how to tackle the issue. The Apple update announced last month will allow users to deactivate their stolen smartphone online through an activation lock. Even if the owner's SIM card is removed, a thief can't erase the phone's data without a username and password. Demands:  Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, is among politicians pushing all phone manufacturers to tackle phone theft . An Apple ID and password are also . required to turn off the new 'Find My Phone' application--which tracks a . stolen or lost phone's GPS location. A custom message, such as 'This . iPhone is lost. Please call me' will be continuously displayed even if . thieves manage to erase the phone. 'We think this is going to be a really powerful theft deterrent,' Apple's senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi said at the developer's conference . Police warn that criminals want mobile phones, iPads and other electronic devices to sell on the black market overseas, where handsets can be sold on for twice their value in the UK. And they say the public are leaving themselves vulnerable to attack by texting or using the internet while walking along, often with earphones in, oblivious to what is going on around them. The Office for National Statistics said the number of personal thefts increased by eight per cent last year. In the year to December 2012 police recorded 107,471 such offences up from 99,396 a year earlier. The true total is likely to be much higher as many people do not report incidents to the police. An ONS spokesman said: ‘This represents a speeding-up of the recent increases seen for this offence. ‘Anecdotal evidence suggests that this may be in part driven by theft of smartphones including the phenomena of bike riders stealing phones from people’s hands.’","Would allow stolen device to be disabled even if thief had tampered with it .

"Three Japanese-born scientists have won the Nobel Prize in physics for inventing blue-light emitting diodes (LEDs) that have revolutionised the lighting industry. Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano of Japan and U.S. scientist Shuji Nakamura won the award for their 1990s invention, which has led to the use of environmentally-friendly light sources worldwide. But when Nakamura invented the technology in 1993, the company he worked for at the time awarded him the equivalent of just £125 ($200) - despite the idea being worth a potential £50 billion ($80 billion) by 2020 according to estimates. Scroll down for video . Shuji Nakamura (left), Isamu Akasaki (centre) and Hiroshi Amano (right), all born in Japan, have won the 2014  Nobel Physics Prize, for their  environmentally-friendly blue LEDs. The lighting breakthrough creates more energy-efficient home lighting, and can improve keyhole surgery techniques . The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the invention is just 20 years old, 'but it has already contributed to create white light in an entirely new manner to the benefit of us all.' In this image Shuji Nakamura demonstrates different LED lights during a presentation in Santa Barbara . Shuji Nakamura invented the blue light-emitting-diode while working for the Nichia Corporation in Tokushima, Japan in 1993. Estimates suggest the technology, used in everything from homes to billboards today, will be worth £50 billion ($80 billion) in 2020 according to Quartz. But when he first came up with Nichia rewarded him with just 20,000 yen (£125 or $200), as Japanese firms favoured the mentality that work for an employer was not a means for personal glory. However Nakamura quit and moved to the US in 2000, before counter-suing in 2001 after Nichia attempted to sue him for infringing trade secrets. 107 Nobel Prizes in Physics have been awarded between 1901-2013. 47 Physics Prizes have been given to one Laureate only. 2 women have been awarded the Physics Prize so far. 1 person, John Bardeen, has been awarded the Physics Prize twice. 25 years was the age of the youngest Physics Laureate ever, Lawrence Bragg, when he was awarded the 1915 Physics Prize together with his father. 55 is the average age of the Physics Laureates the year they were awarded the prize. Source: Nobelprize.org . He was ultimately awarded £5.04 million ($8.1 million) for the idea, reported as the largest payout ever made to an employee for an invention. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that while the technology is just 20 years old, 'it has already contributed to create white light in an entirely new manner to the benefit of us all.' Akasaki, 85, is a professor at Meijo University and distinguished professor at Nagoya University. Amano, 54, is also a professor at Nagoya University, while the 60-year-old Nakamura is a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The laureates triggered a transformation of lighting technology when they produced bright blue light from semiconductors, something scientist had struggled with for decades, the Nobel committee said. Using the blue light, LED lamps emitting white light could be created in a new way. 'As about one fourth of world electricity consumption is used for lighting purposes, the LEDs contribute to saving the Earth's resources,' the committee said. LED bulbs (pictured) last for 100,000 hours compared with 10,000 hours for fluorescent tubes and 1,000 hours for tungsten filament light bulbs.They also use around 90 per cent less energy than incandescent bulbs. 'They succeeded where everyone else had failed,' the Nobel committee added. 'Incandescent light bulbs lit the 20th century; the 21st century will be lit by LED lamps. LED bulbs last for 100,000 hours compared with 10,000 hours for fluorescent tubes and 1,000 hours for tungsten filament light bulbs. They also use around 90 per cent less energy than incandescent bulbs. Professor Akasaki said in a nationally-televised news conference that he had often been told that his research wouldn't bear fruit within the 20th century. 'But I never felt that way,' he said. 'I was just doing what I wanted to do.' The benefits of increased efficiency could go far beyond home lighting, and the researchers are now looking at applications that extend from biomedicine to power electronics. The University of Manchester, for instance, is planning to build tiny LED devices that can be implanted by keyhole surgery in cancer patients being treated with radiotherapy. The laureates triggered a transformation of lighting technology when they produced bright blue light from semiconductors in the 1990s, something scientist had struggled with for decades, the Nobel committee said. Journalists waiting for the beginning of this morning's press conference are pictured . 'If a patient moves while an X-ray or proton beam is directed at their tumour, then they risk healthy tissue being damaged,' explained Sir Colin Humphreys from the University of Cambridge. 'An LED attached to a sensor would detect movement at the site of the tumour in order to redirect the beam.' Last year's physics award went to Britain's Peter Higgs and Belgian colleague Francois Englert for helping to explain how matter formed after the Big Bang. Up to three Nobel laureates and two different works can be selected for the Nobel Prize in Physics. Edinburgh-based Peter Higgs (pictured) and Belgian Francois Englebert won the prize last year . 1903 . Pierre and Marie Curie, French and Polish-French respectively, receive the prize along with Frenchman Antoine Henri Becquerel for their discovery and subsequent research of radioactivity. 1921 . German-born Albert Einstein wins the award for his services to theoretical physics and his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect – which revealed metals emit electrons when light shines on them. 1932 . German Werner Heisenberg receives the prize for discovering the principles of quantum mechanics, which we now know to govern the behaviour of subatomic particles. 1978 . Americans Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson jointly receive the prize for discovering cosmic microwave background radiation – the thermal radiation left over in the universe from the Big Bang. 2013 . Briton Peter Higgs and Belgian Francois Englebert scoop the prize for successfully predicting the existence of the Higgs boson particle – the 'God particle' found by Cern in 2012 that could explain why matter has mass. Compared with other Nobel Prizes, some believe the nomination and selection process for the prize in Physics is much longer and far more rigorous. Nobel Prize season began yesterday with the announcement of the 102nd Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine. The prize is awarded for 'the most important discovery', rather than for a lifetime's portfolio of work by a researchers, doctor or scientist. Yesterday's prize was given to John O'Keefe at University College London, and the Norwegian husband-and-wife team, Edvard and May-Britt Moser. The team discovered cells in the brain that act as the body's internal global positioning system. The Nobel Prizes will be handed out on December 10, which is also the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel's (left) death in 1896. On the right is a list of the top ten most popular Nobel Laureates in Physics . Since these cells are among the first to be hit in Alzheimer's, understanding how they are degraded should shed important light on the disease process. Four Nobel Laureates have been forced by authorities to decline the Nobel Prize. Adolf Hitler told three German Nobel Laureates, Richard Kuhn, Adolf Butenandt and Gerhard Domagk, that they could not accept their award. They all later received the Nobel Prize Diploma and Medal, but not the prize amount. Boris Pasternak, the 1958 Nobel Laureate in Literature, initially accepted the Nobel Prize but was later coerced by the authorities of the Soviet Union to decline. Source: Nobelprize.org . Winners must be alive, but they are not contacted until very shortly before the official announcement. This rule proved problematic in 2011, when it was discovered that Canadian Ralph Steinman, had died of cancer four days before being told about his Nobel Prize. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry will be announced tomorrow, and the Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday. This will be followed by the award of the Nobel peace prize on Friday and the Nobel Prize in economics will be announced on Monday. Winners in all categories receive 8.0 million Swedish kronor this year – just over £690,000 or $1.1 million. The Nobel Prizes will be handed out on December 10, the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel's death in 1896. From 1901 to 2013, 876 have received Nobel Prizes including the likes of Marie Curie, Nelson Mandela and Ernest Hemingway.","Award given to Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano at Nagoya University, Japan and Shuji Nakamura at University of California at Santa Barbara .

"Large numbers of migrants living in the UK cannot speak fluent English -  placing huge strain on schools and the NHS. Official figures found that up to a third of people from the biggest migrant communities in Britain cannot speak English well. Analysis of information from the  2011 census of England and Wales  showed that migrants are less likely to have good health if they do not speak English well. Concerns: Large numbers of migrants living in the UK cannot speak fluent English -  placing huge strain on schools and the NHS. This picture was taken in Boston, which has seen an influx of migrants . The figures also highlighted the extra burden schools face in teaching children who speak different languages. Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, Paul Kenny, the mayor of Boston Borough Council, which has . seen a huge influx of Eastern European migrants in the area, said: 'I am mindful . that it can put a strain on resources. About five years ago, our schools . were really struggling. 'They are better equipped to deal with . these issues now, but I think we’ve still got a long way to go with the . issue of trying to make sure that we get more integration, and teaching . English as a second language is vital.' The figures revealed those who speak Polish as their main language make up the largest group other than native English speakers. Worrying: Highlighting the additional strain placed on the NHS, third of migrants unable to speak English fluently were in poor health . However, more than a quarter of that population group, said their English was either not good or non-existent. For people whose principal tongue was Urdu or Gujarati it was a similar figure.The census also showed that nearly a third of native Punjabi and Bengali speakers also could not speak English fluently. Highlighting the additional strain placed on the NHS, a third of migrants unable to speak English fluently were in poor health. The figures showed that for 92 per cent of people aged three and over, English was the main language. A total of 726,000 people in the UK cannot speak English fluently with 138,000 who unable to speak it at all. In the UK there are 88 main languages spoken other than English . Polish is the largest group with 546,000 speakers.","More than a quarter of Polish speakers said English was not good or non-existent .

"A six-year-old boy's eyes were gouged out by a woman who tricked the youngster and not organ traffickers as first thought, it emerged today. Police said that a woman took the youngster - known as Guo Bin - into a field in northern China and then gouged out his eyes on Saturday. His family found him covered in blood and . crying in pain three to four hours later in a rural area of Linfen city in Shanxi province. Scroll down for video . Injured: Guo Bin's eyes were gouged out by a woman and not organ traffickers as first thought, it emerged today. The 6-year-old is pictured recuperating from the attack . Guo Bin recuperates with his mother following the attack in the rural area of Linfen city that left him blind . The boy's eyeballs were found at the scene and the corneas hadn't been removed - which rubbishes the theories that his corneas . were taken for sale because of a donor shortage in China. The boy is now recovering in hospital but has lost his sight permanently. The Beijing Times newspaper quoted the parents of the boy, whose family name is Guo according to police, as saying that their son had told them he was walking along a path when he was grabbed by a woman. She used an unspecified tool to gouge out his eyes, they said. An entire eye cannot be transplanted, but a cornea could be vital for a patient with faltering vision. Guo Bin's devastated father said: ‘We didn’t notice his eyes were gone when we . discovered him – he had blood all over his face. We thought he had . fallen down and smashed his face.’ The . boy was rushed to hospital where doctors were shocked to find his eyes . had been removed.

Recovering: The youngster was playing alone outside his home in Linfen, Shanxi Province, when he was snatched on Monday evening . Guo Bin was shown . on state TV  being taken in bandages from an operating theatre to a . hospital bed, writhing in agony as his shocked family wept. China Central Television said he had been drugged and ‘lost consciousness’ before the attacker removed his eyes. His parents discovered he was missing when they called for him to come in around 8pm on Monday but received no response. Mortified: Relatives of the youngster talk to a nurse. His parents realised he was missing when they tried to call hm inside the house but received no response . After . a frantic search with relatives, they found him screaming in a field . near their home in Fenxi, north China. The kidnapper had reportedly told Guo Bin: ‘Don’t cry and I won’t gouge out your eyes.’ It had been feared his eyes were taken by organ traffickers. China . does not have a donor culture, but about 300,000 patients need . transplants each year. Only about 10,000 receive organs, mainly taken . from death-row prisoners. Though . the sale and transplant of organs for money is prohibited, lax laws and . widespread corruption have fuelled a booming industry. China is also a leading destination for ‘transplant tourists’ who travel there to obtain organs. Distraught: The boy's father found his son screaming in a nearby field with blood covering his face .

"Survivor: John Trippon pictured on Omaha Beach in Normandy, France, 70 years after he landed there during D-Day . He was a solemn, silent figure behind the crowds that flocked to Omaha Beach yesterday to watch a re-enactment of the bloodiest battle of D-Day. Thirty men in US Army uniform ran towards the cliffs across a vast expanse of sand and were cut down by make-believe machine-gun fire until only six remained standing. They had gained no more than ten yards. You couldn’t really blame John Trippon if he wasn’t too impressed by the reconstruction because 70 years ago, he did it for real. And yesterday, above a beach that was once drenched in blood and carpeted with the bodies of his friends, he was quietly staging his own reconstruction. At the same spot where he eventually swam, crawled and ran ashore under heavy fire in 1944, the 92-year-old engineer allowed his children and grandchildren to film and record his testimony – a startlingly graphic, deeply humbling account of a horror he does not want anyone to forget. How he survived when so many died around him, however, is something he still struggles to explain. He was a fit young soldier then, one of 40 dropped 90 yards offshore as German machine gun and artillery fire pinned down and tore through the ranks ahead of them. What no-one realised was that shell-fire had blown a massive, water-filled pit into the sea bed, and the troops were jumping into it. ‘All my equipment weighed me down and I sunk to the bottom of a 20ft crater,’ he said. He had to shed his kit, ammunition, grenades and weapons and swim to shore. ‘All the time the German machine-gunner was mowing people down. 'Why the hell I didn’t die there I can’t say. I guess he was too busy killing other guys. 'There were so many bodies lying in the water they stopped bringing any more troops ashore because it was freaking people out to see all these guys dead. They had to bring bulldozers in to push the bodies into a trench so they couldn’t be seen. Scroll down for videos .

We got up against the cliff face and it was so steep the Germans couldn’t shoot down at us. We could only move after the ships used their guns to take out the pill-boxes.’ Mr Trippon, a grandfather and great grandfather from Sun City, Arizona, still bears scars on his legs from his role as a ‘human bridge’ assigned to lie across concertina barbed wire to allow his comrades to run over him in safety.

Only later, when infantrymen were blown up advancing through it, did they discover it was a minefield.

"Lee Rigby's murderers had threatened bystanders and police with a 'cowboy' gun from the 1920s that could not be fired. After hacking the soldier to death, Michael Adebowale's role was the wave the weapon at those who tried to approach them. The killer, 22, and his accomplice Michael Adebolajo, 28, had hoped that by having the gun the police would shoot them dead and send them to 'paradise' as martyrs. But although they were shot by police marksmen in Woolwich, they survived. The pair were today found guilty of hacking Fusilier Lee Rigby, 25, to death and nearly decapitating him outside Woolwich Barracks in May. 'Weapon': Lee Rigby's murderers brandished this 9.4mm KNIL model 91 revolver from the 1920s which could not be fired . Target: Lee Rigby was chosen because he was wearing this military-style rucksack. His killers admitted they could not be completely sure he was in the military . Adebolajo claimed they are not murderers because they are 'soldiers of Allah' at 'war' with Britain over its foreign policy. He kissed the Qu'ran and smiled as he was found guilty today while Adebowale showed no emotion. They will both be sentenced next month. The court heard the pair brandished a 9.4mm KNIL model 91 revolver, manufactured between 1920 and 1922 at the scene in the hope they would be shot dead by police. Their twisted plan for martyrdom effectively backfired when police shot the pair - but managed to avoid killing them. Testing later revealed it could not be used to fire ammunition and only worked after the moving parts were oiled and lubricated. Adebowale has lost at least the thumb on his right hand after he waved it at police after already being shot. Asked when Adebolajo had tried, unsuccessfully, to buy bullets for the gun, he said: ‘I will not be specific, but it was a long time before the incident.’ Guilty: Murderers Michael Adebolajo, who . described himself as a 'soldier of Allah', attempted to decapitate . Drummer Rigby while Michael Adebowale hacked at his body in the most . appalling crime . He said they chose Fusilier Rigby because he was wearing an army-style rucksack, but admitted they were not completely sure that he was in the Army. The first armed officer on the scene, named only as E48, said Adebowale was shot in the leg and stomach, and when he raised his arm holding the gun they fired twice at his hand and blew off a digit. ‘He raised one of his arms up. I’ve still got a distinct image in my mind of him holding a black revolver in his hand,’ he told the court. ‘The next two shots shot his thumb off. The hand holding the weapon’.

"A British quantum physicist who was tipped to win a Nobel prize was killed just an hour after arriving in Australia by a joyrider high on cannabis, an inquest has heard. Cancer survivor and charity volunteer Dr Sean Barrett, 36, was killed when a stolen 4x4 driven by Antony Fogarty jumped at least two red lights at speeds of up to 100mph and ploughed into his taxi. The vehicle hit the scientist's cab with such force it was sent skidding 45 metres down the road, the inquest in Manchester was told. The lecturer and researcher, who worked at Imperial College London, was killed instantly along with 28-year-old taxi driver and expectant father Kuldeep Singh on their journey from Perth Airport to the city. Scroll down for video . Cancer survivor and charity volunteer Dr Sean Barrett, 36, was killed when a stolen 4x4 driven by Antony Fogarty jumped at least two red lights at speeds of up to 100mph and ploughed into his taxi in Australia . Fogarty, 24, was high on a cocktail of cannabis and also amphetamine at the time of the 2am crash and was being tracked by police helicopter. He was also subject to a three-year driving disqualification and had never held a Western Australia driving licence. He later pleaded guilty to two counts of manslaughter and was jailed for 11 years last January. He will be eligible for parole in nine years. At an inquest in Manchester on Monday in which a coroner recorded a conclusion of unlawful killing, Fogarty was condemned as a 'repulsive monster' by Dr Barrett's mother Janet. She said the Cambridge University graduate, who held a prestigious Royal Society research fellowship, was thought by many at Imperial College to be capable of winning a Nobel Prize. She added that he believed his work, which included plans to build the world's first quantum computer and mathematical analysis of cancer treatments, could 'change the world beyond all imagination'. He had recently recovered from cancer himself and was an active fundraiser for Macmillan. Originally from Salford but living in London at the time of his death, Dr Barrett's work took him all over the world and during his time in Australia he was due to give a speech at the University of Western Australia on quantum physics. Fogarty, 24, was high on a cocktail of cannabis and also amphetamine at the time of the 2am crash, and was being tracked by police helicopter . Former art teacher Mrs Barrett said: 'He could have got 22 years to life yet he only got 11. I don't understand it. He killed two people. It was two counts of manslaughter but he will out in no time unless somebody blocks his parole. He will come out and kill somebody else. That's my view on the repulsive monster who killed my son.' Mrs Barrett, who also has a 38-year-old daughter Katie who is a teacher in Milan, added: 'Sean was more than brilliant - he was an important man. 'He was an achiever, an accomplished theoretical physicist, a graduate of Cambridge, a research fellow, doing research and teaching at Imperial College London. 'They thought he would have gone on to win a Nobel Prize. The fact he had been awarded a Royal Society fellowship allowed him to do what he wanted to do. He had a brilliant mind and he was a special person. 'He was working on a hard problem and he believed that the solution would change the world beyond all imagination. He was thinking that it would perhaps save the planet. Finally, he was a humane, kind, gentle genius who tried to change this world for the better. His family and friends find it impossible to sum up what he meant to us and what his death means.' At an inquest in Manchester on Monday in which a coroner recorded a conclusion of unlawful killing, Fogarty was condemned as a 'repulsive monster' by Dr Barrett's mother Janet . The inquest was held as Dr Barrett died on Friday October 19 2012 but there had been a lengthy delay waiting for the criminal proceedings to conclude and for documents to be delivered to England. A post-mortem concluded that he died at the scene from multiple injuries which were described as 'non-survivable'. Reaching her conclusion, coroner Fiona Borrill said that the risk of death was 'almost inevitable' when Fogarty - who had a number of previous convictions and a history of drug addiction - got behind the wheel. She said: 'Clearly the driver of the stolen car did owe a duty of care towards Sean as another road user and clearly that has been breached. 'It was a reasonably foreseeable consequence that as a result of the manner of his driving that the risk of death was almost inevitable if he collided with another vehicle. 'This driver was driving the vehicle at speed for a very lengthy period of time while the police were trying to stop him. 'The speeds recorded range from 140-160kmh which is excessive to say the least. More importantly it is clear from the toxicology results that this driver was under the influence of illicit substances - amphetamines and cannabis. That would have seriously impacted his driving. 'This must have been a tragic loss of a very special person who had a massive amount to give and so much more to achieve.' Dr Barrett is survived by his siblings Kate, Jonathan and Zoe, his two nephews and his girlfriend Ruth.","Dr Sean Barrett, 36, was killed by stolen 4x4 driven by Antony Fogarty .

"They look like two typical fans posing in front of Kayne West as he performs at the wedding of the favourite grandson of Kazakh dictator Nursultan Nazarbayev. But the pair with their eyes on Kim Kardashian's boyfriend are two eligible Kazakh 'princesses', from enormously powerful clans in the oil and gas rich ex-Soviet state made famous by Sacha Baron Cohen mocking film starring TV reporter 'Borat'. On the left is Venera Nazarbayeva, 23,  the tyrant's granddaughter, whose Sandhurst-educated brother Aysultan, a Kazakh military intelligence officer, was celebrating his wedding with West's $3 million gig.

Other pictures posted on the web by guests at the lavish celebration in Almaty were captioned as showing glamorous Shynar and West on the dance floor together. Aysultan, 23, is being groomed as a possible successor of the 73 year old president, say some sources in Kazakh capital Astana, though fierce battles between influential clans mean it is hard to predict what will happen when he goes. Nazarbayev - widely criticised for human rights abuses and rigging elections - employs Tony Blair as an advisor  in an £8 million a year consultancy deal. Ironically, one of Nazarbayev's most implacable foes is Rakhat Aliyev, ex-husband of his daughter Dariga, and father of both Aysultan and Venera. Aliyev, once head of Nazarbayev's secret services, now lives in exile in Europe where he fears he could be seized by Kazakh spies and forced to face 'political' charges in his homeland. 'Kayne West should have thought twice before performing in Kazakhstan for the Nazarbayev family,' said an opposition source. Connections: West dances with Shynar Nematova .

"An aspiring model whose 36DD taxpayer-funded breasts sparked public anger has criticised a woman for having a £5,000 tummy tuck on the NHS. Josie Cunningham, 23, fuelled public anger when she had £4,800 worth of breast . enlargement surgery on the NHS in January after complaining she had been . bullied over her ‘flat’ 32A chest. But despite the controversy her own treatment caused, she has now criticised single mother and  aspiring actress Kelly McManus who had a £5,000 tummy tuck on the NHS – because she wanted a better love life. War of words: Aspiring model Josie Cunningham, right, whose 36DD taxpayer-funded breasts sparked public anger has criticised Kelly McManus , left, for having a £5,000 tummy tuck on the NHS . Speaking to The Sun, Miss Cunningham said: 'This is an incredible waste of taxpayers' money. Thousands of mothers have the same problem after childbirth. Kelly should have just worked harder at losing her baby bump naturally.' Miss McManus said she lost her confidence after having three children and was embarrassed to show her ‘mummy tummy’ to men. She also wanted the surgery to increase her chances of pursuing an  acting career because she wants to be the next Julia Roberts. But the part-time beautician, who  earns £7,000 a year, could not afford the procedure and pleaded with doctors to help her get rid of her bulge. Controversial: Kelly's decision caused a media furore but she is unrepentant . After 18 months of visiting her GP, she was referred to a surgeon for the taxpayer-funded operation. Miss McManus, who once appeared on ITV’s Jeremy Kyle show, said: ‘What people need to understand is that it has been really hard for me. ‘I constantly looked pregnant and it was affecting my social life. I had no confidence when I went out with my friends. 'But one of the worst things was that I felt embarrassed when I took my clothes off in front of men and so it affected my sex life and I’d just had enough. ‘The new tummy makes me feel a lot more attractive and I have already been out with friends and my sex life is also slowly improving. It is great. ‘And if it helps my career as an actress, something I’ve always wanted, then I don’t think I’ve done anything wrong. It has changed my life and I’m not going to say sorry for that.’ The 27-year-old believes the operation has saved the NHS money in the long term, claiming it would have cost more money to treat her for depression. She said: ‘After my first child my stomach never went back to its normal size. ‘Then after my third child I began to suffer from a condition where my stomach muscles had separated from my bulge. ‘It had started making me feel really down and I’m not going to apologise for getting it done.’ But campaigners were outraged at the decision to fund the operation when cuts are being made elsewhere in the NHS. A spokesman for The TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It’s ridiculous that the NHS pays for procedures that are not based on strict medical needs. ‘Patients missing out on vital drugs and treatment will find this deeply unfair.’ However, Miss McManus hit back at her critics, saying she deserved the operation and would urge other woman to follow the same path. She said: ‘I only did it after I became desperate and  knew that I wouldn’t be able to afford it. ‘I hated feeling depressed  and now I’m a lot happier  and can go out more without feeling self-conscious. ‘I don’t make the decisions about who does and does  not get surgery – that’s up  to the doctors. So it’s not  my fault if people with other conditions are not getting treated properly. ‘I would tell other women  to go for it because there is  no point feeling down about stuff and you can get it sorted on the NHS.’ At first doctors recommended physiotherapy and exercise for Miss McManus to improve the appearance of her stomach but she claims it did not work. Eventually, she was referred to a surgeon. The three-hour operation to remove the excess skin on her abdomen was carried out at Bradford Royal Infirmary last month. She said: ‘It’s only been a few weeks but I feel great and my friends have said the same. It’s a great confidence boost.’ In another case earlier this year, Josie Cunningham, 23, told how she had £4,800 worth of breast enlargement surgery on the NHS in January after complaining she had been bullied over her ‘flat’ 32A chest. But after undergoing the operation, the aspiring model from Leeds said her 36DD breasts had made her the target of online abuse. Miss Cunningham then said she would like a reduction and compensation. She claimed she was not properly consulted before the operation and wanted compensation for clinical negligence and emotional distress. Miss Cunningham, who works in telesales, consulted no-win, no-fee lawyers so she can ‘take [theNHS] for every penny’.","Josie Cunningham had £4,800 worth of breast .

"Hundreds of young American and Canadian Jews have arrived in Tel Aviv, ready to join the Israeli army despite the ongoing conflict in Gaza. More than 300 Jews were flown on a specially chartered flight for Aliyah - a traditional emigration of people to Israel that dates back to Biblical times. Of the 338 on the plane, 215 were young men, women and even children who have come to fight for the Israeli forces. More than 200 young North American Jews have flown to Israel for Aliyah to become citizens and join the Army . Israel is one of only three countries with mandatory military service for women. Girls can join the army aged 17 . New Israeli citizens - collectively called Olim - must do a year of national service, as must any other person before they turn 25. More than 100 children who cannot yet join Israel's Army were on the flight, but the boys can sign up when they are 18 years old and girls when they are just 17. Israel is one of the few nations in the world that insists that young women must serve for their armed forces, with girls aged 17 to 20 expected to complete a year of national service. Around 38 families were on board the flight that landed at Ben Gurian International Airport, nine miles from the city of Tel Aviv. More than 300 American and Canadian Jews were on the flight to Tel Aviv, including these two girls . A young boy wearing a USA sports shirt wheels his luggage of the plane as young men disembark while waving the Israeli flag and cheering to their friends on the tarmac . More than 8,000 North American immigrants came to Israel in the last three years, with the latest Army recruits suggesting that the conflict in Gaza has not deterred many from moving to the Middle East. The new citizens were played a pre-recorded message from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on arrival, the Jerusalem Post reported. He said: 'When Israel is being attacked and you young Jews come to Israel, you tell our enemies that they will never succeed in bending our spirit or driving us away. You are coming to stand up for our future.' They were greeted on the tarmac by Israeli President Reuven Rivlin and interior minister Gideon Saar. Mr Saar told the immigrants: 'Almost each of is, if he is not a new immigrant, is the son of a new immigrant. I am the son of an immigrant who came from Argentina forty nine years ago and every immigrant and their sons and daughters can reach any place in our open society.' 'Ensure the future of the people of Israel here in the land of Israel.' The recruits were greeted by Israel's new President Reuven Rivlin (right) and interior minister Gideon Saar . The 215 future soldiers were played a message from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . People travel to Israel to Aliyah from all over the world, with slightly less than 53,000 immigrants in the last three years. This included 12,500 from Russia and 32,400 from Europe, of which 1,561 came from the UK. The month-long war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza has claimed the lives of more than 1,900 Palestinians, mostly civilians. In Israel 67 have been killed, of which all but three were soldiers. A three-day ceasefire brokered in Egypt was holding earlier today, allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza.","215 Americans and Canadians land in Israel, planning to join the army .

"A pupil at a Chinese high school is seen apparently leaping to his death in surveillance camera footage that has been uploaded to the Internet. The clip shows the scene in a crowded classroom as pupils settle down for a lesson. They all appear to be preparing their materials, save for one student who sits motionless in the bottom right. Just as the youngsters appear ready to start their lesson, that boy suddenly stands up at his desk and runs to the nearest side of the room. Although that part of the room is out of shot, it is understood that he leapt from a window - a conclusion that seems backed up by the distraught response of fellow pupils. Classroom horror: Pupils are settling down for a lesson, unaware that one among them is planning his suicide . After several seconds apparently deep in reflection the boy suddenly gets up and makes for the window . Some run to the window to peer out, others run from the room, while one simply paces while clutching her head in her hands. One student comes to the front of the class where he points at the teacher and shouts something at her. MailOnline did not have a Mandarin speaker on hand to translate. The video was uploaded to LiveLeak today. It appears to be footage filmed on a smartphone of a computer screen showing the feed from the school's CCTV system. A description of the video says: 'High school student Xiao Zhen leaps to his death from a a window in the middle of class. It is believed this happened due to pressure of preparing for college entrance exams.' While the video's authenticity cannot be confirmed, it fits with a disturbing trend among Chinese youngsters for whom suicide has become the number one cause of death. In most countries in the West, accidents are the biggest cause of death for young people. The unusually high suicide rate among Chinese youth has been blamed on intense pressure to succeed in school, where the education system places great emphasis on grades and status at the expense of healthy social lives. It doesn't take long for the boy's classmates to realise what he has done . Pupils erupt in grief and shock at the apparent suicide, screaming, crying and some of them running out . Last November the parents of a ten-year-old boy blamed a schoolteacher for their son's death, claiming that she had 'told him' to jump from a building after he failed to complete a punishment assignment. Jun Jun smashed into a parked car beneath the flat where his family live in the Jinjiang district of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province. China’s suicide rate has soared 60 percent in the past 50 years. According to data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention an average of 287,000 Chinese citizens kill themselves every year.","The clip apparently taken from school CCTV was posted to LiveLeak today .

"An Iraq war veteran who launched his own aid group to provide medical help for Syrian war refugees has been named as the next potential victim of ISIS. Former U.S. Army Ranger Peter Kassig, 26, has been confirmed as the latest American hostage to be held by Islamic State militants after he featured at the end of a video showing the beheading of British aid worker Alan Henning. In the footage, which emerged on the internet tonight, Mr Kassig, from Indianapolis, is shown on his knees next to 'Jihadi John'. The young aid worker is being held by the Jihadi who tells the camera that President Obama's aerial bombardment in Syria means that 'it is only right to continue to strike the necks of your people.' Scroll down for video . Former U.S. Army Ranger and Iraq war veteran Peter Kassig, 26, is believed to be the latest U.S hostage to be held by Islamic State militants in Syria after he featured at the end of Alan Henning's execution video (above) The 26-year-old, from Indianapolis, (pictured) enlisted in the Army in 2004 and was deployed to Iraq in 2007 . While Mr Kassig can be seen on his knees, a caption on the screen reads, 'Peter Edward Kassig (American).' In a direct address to President Barack Obama, 'Jihadi John' then tells the camera: 'Obama you have started your aerial bombardment in Sham (Syria) which keeps on striking our people, so it's only right we continue to strike the necks of your people.' U.S. officials confirmed this evening that Kassig was being held by Islamic State militants but declined to give any more details of his capture. President Obama's counterterrorism adviser, Lisa Monaco, said the US had seen the video and was evaluating it. 'This is again yet another just very clear example of the brutality of this group, and why the president has articulated and is moving out in a comprehensive way to degrade and destroy ISIL,' she said, using an acronym for the group. 'Our hearts go out to the British aid worker who we believe is in that video, and to the remaining hostages and to their families.' Tonight, Mr Kassig's parents Ed and Paula released a statement in the wake of the video asking people to pray for their son. They confirmed he was captured on October 1 last year on his way to Deir Ezzour in eastern Syria but said the family had kept silent about his abduction 'at the wish of those who have held their son'. He was captured on October 1 last year on his way to Deir Ezzour in eastern Syria while providing aid relief . His family said he had converted to Islam while being held captive and had taken the name Abdul Rahman . Mr Kassig, from Indianapolis, was deployed to Iraq for a brief period in 2007 before becoming an aid worker . The family statement added: 'The Kassig family extends our concern for the family of Alan Henning. 'We have read about his work and his generous character with great respect and admiration. 'We ask everyone around the world to pray for the Henning family, for our son, and for the release of all innocent people being held hostage in the Middle East and around the globe.' The family also added that while in captivity in Syria, Mr Kassig converted to Islam and took the name Abdul Rahman. They said they had heard from former hostages who told them his faith had been providing him comfort. Butler University in Indianapolis, where Mr Kassig studied political science in 2010, also released a statement in the wake of the video. It said: 'Peter Kassig was a student at Butler University from 2010 to 2012, majoring in political science. 'Since his time at Butler, Peter has dedicated his life to humanitarian work in the Middle East. 'The thoughts and prayers of the Butler University community are with Peter and his family.' Indiana Democratic Senator Joe added: 'This is an unimaginably devastating situation for any parent to endure. 'My prayers are with Peter's parents at this terrible time. My family, like everyone in Indiana and across our country, is praying for and thinking of Peter and his family. 'I ask for respect of the Kassig family's privacy as they seek to navigate this heartbreaking situation. 'I ask all Hoosiers to continue to keep Peter in their thoughts and prayers in the days ahead.' Mr Kassig enlisted in the Army in 2004 and was deployed to Iraq between April 2007 and September 2007 . Mr Kassig set up a non-profit organisation called Special Emergency Response and Assistance to provide aid . It is understood that Mr Kassig enlisted in the Army in 2004, and became a Ranger, ultimately serving in the 75th Ranger Regiment - an Army special operations unit. According to his military record, he trained at Fort Benning in Georgia in 2006, and was deployed to Iraq from April to July 2007. He was medically discharged at the rank of private first class in September 2007 and returned to the United States to study political science. However, in 2010, he decided to take time off from his studies and began his certification as an emergency medical technician. In 2012, he then decided to travel to Beirut to try and help those in need as a result of the Syria crisis. Last year, in an interview with Time, he said he did so because he was 'interested in what I could learn about the Syrian crisis first-hand and what I could do to help raise awareness about the crisis'. It was after a short time in the country that he started up his own aid group called Special Emergency Response and Assistance — SERA. SERA's main focus is to provide 'Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Syria with medical assistance, medical supplies, and clothing for refugees, and non-perishable food as well as cooking fuel, cooking stoves,' and other supplies, according to its Facebook page. Mr Kassig told Time that he designed the organisation around a belief that 'there was a lot of room for improvement in terms of how humanitarian organizations interact with and cooperate with the populations that they serve.' SERA, he said, focused on supplementing the work of larger organisations by delivering aid that could 'do the most good for the most people over the longest period of time possible.' A video claiming to show the beheading of British aid worker Alan Henning emerged on the internet tonight . Mr Henning, 47, was taken hostage by Islamic State militants on Boxing Day last year while giving aid in Syria . 'It's about showing people that we care, that someone is looking out for those who might be overlooked or who have slipped through the cracks in the system for whatever reason,' he said. Writing on his profile page on fundraising website FundRazr, Mr Kassig also said he had previously worked as a medic in a hospital in Tripoli, Lebanon. He said it was during that time that he decided to set up his aid charity. He said: 'When I first started this cause to help those in need, I was on my own but I saw first-hand the shortages in available resources and supplies for people who were suffering in Lebanon, Syria, and Turkey as a result of the violence. 'The amount of feedback and support from people all around the world motivated me to get organised and develop a platform through which people could send donations to support the continuation of my work.' During an interview with CNN in 2012, Mr Kassig said he set up the SERA aid group because he was 'an idealist' and 'believed in hopeless causes'. He said: 'There is this impression, this belief that there is no hope. That's when it's more important than ever that we come in against all odds and we do something. 'We each get one life and that's it. We get one shot at this and we don't get any do-overs, and for me, it was time to put up or shut up,. 'The way I saw it, I didn't have a choice. This is what I was put here to do. I guess I am just a hopeless romantic, and I am an idealist, and I believe in hopeless causes. 'This is real, and it's scary stuff, and it's sad what is happening to people here. People back home need to know about it, they need to know. Sometimes you gotta take a stand, you gotta draw a line somewhere.' Alan Henning: 'I am Alan Henning. Because of our parliament's decision to attack the Islamic state I as a member of the British public will now pay the price for that decision.' Jihadi John: 'The blood of David Haines was on your hands Cameron, Alan Henning will also be slaughtered but his blood is on the hands of the British parliament.' Jihadi John then steps forward to cut Mr Henning's throat and his body is shown lying on the floor. Peter Kassig is then shown kneeling next to Jihadi John. Jihadi John: 'Obama you have started your aerial bombardment in Sham (Syria) which keeps on striking our people, so it's only right we continue to strike the necks of your people.' Mr Kassig has also previously told how he travelled around the region helping hundreds of Syrians who had been displaced by the conflict. One of the sacrifices he made was offering his services to a trauma unit which treated severely injured Syrian refugees. At the time, he added: 'This work is important for the message that it sends to people back home, that one of the best aspects of the American way of life is our ability to come together in the face of adversity and to stand beside those who might need a helping hand. 'In five years, if I can look back on all of this and say that our organisation is able to truly help people, that I was able so share a little bit of hope and that I never stopped learning then I will know this all stood for something.' In a statement issued this evening, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said every effort would be made to bring Mr Kassig home. She said: 'At this point we have no reason to doubt the authenticity of the video released earlier today. 'We will continue to use every tool at our disposal - military, diplomatic, law enforcement and intelligence - to try to bring Peter home to his family.'","Peter Kassig appears in latest ISIS video showing British aid worker's death .

"Held: Irish Roman Catholic priest Francis Paul Cullen, 85, has been arrested in Tenerife for allegedly sexually abusing three altar boys in Britain over a 36-year period . An 85-year-old Irish Roman Catholic priest suspected of sexually abusing three altar boys in Britain over a 36-year period has been arrested in Tenerife.

"Defiant: Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg has said his countrymen refused to be afraid of violence and would respond to the attacks with 'more democracy' Norway's prime minister struck a defiant tone today saying the response to twin attacks that have rocked his country will be 'more democracy'. Jens Stoltenberg said Norwegians would defend themselves by showing they were not afraid of violence and by participating more broadly in politics. The vicious attacks on Friday have left the normally placid Norwegians appalled and shaky, but determined to get on with their lives. Mr Stoltenberg said: 'It's absolutely possible to have an open, democratic, inclusive society, and at the same time have security measures and not be naive.' Norwegian police have used a sonar boat to recover belongings from the bottom of the lake where a mass shooting took place on Friday. Officers are still gathering evidence after 68 people were shot dead on Utoya Island during a 90-minute rampage by a lone gunman. Speaking at a press conference, senior police said two officers and eight special forces officers went to the island after the alert was raised. Officers described hearing constant gunfire after arriving at the island, near Sundvollen. Anders Behring Breivik, who has confessed to the attacks, was arrested 'in the normal way' with his hands up, they told the media. After checking there was only one gunman, police then began an evacuation of more than 600 people. 'We are proud and humbled by everybody who helped on Utoya Island,' they said. 'The police did a remarkable job on the island and afterwards.' A country in mourning: Roses float on the lake by Utoya Island where 68 people, many of them young adults, were shot dead on Friday . Memorial: Flowers, candles and messages lie on a temporary site on the shore at Utoya Island. Police have been using a sonar boat to recover belongings from the bottom of the lake . The leader of Norway's Delta Force defended the special operations team, saying the breakdown of a boat did not cause significant delay to reaching the island. Police have come under scrutiny over how long it took them to get to the scene. Although the island is just 25 miles from Oslo, it was 90 minutes before officers arrived. Officers were already dealing with the widespread damage from the fertiliser bomb in the downtown government quarter which Breivik claims to have detonated. When word of the shooting came, they drove rather than take a helicopter because the crew of the only aircraft available was on holiday. At least 76 people were killed in the shooting at a youth camp and a bomb attack in the government quarter in Oslo. Extensive damage: Rubble can be seen near the government buildings that were targeted by a fertiliser bomb on Friday. Some Cabinet members returned to their offices today . Reconstruction: Workers cover one of the damaged government buildings. Car rental firm AVIS confirmed Breivik had hired two vehicles, including a van used to house the bomb . Reeling: People take part in a memorial march last night in Sundvollen, near Utoya island . Breivik claimed to have carried out the attacks because he was trying to save the Western world from Muslim colonisation. Norwegian media are suggesting that police knew Breivik's identity even before they reach the island after tracing him through a rental car company from which he hired the panel van where the bomb was planted. Dag Andre Johansen, chief executive of Avis, said Breivik had rented two vehicles, including a Volkswagen Crafter van. Fascist: A copy of the 1,500-page manifesto Breivik emailed to 250 UK contacts before carrying out the attacks. Claims he was in contact with the far-right EDL have been denied by police . It comes after two security scares in the capital Oslo this morning. The Oslo Sentral train station was evacuated because of a suspicious suitcase left on a airport-bound bus. Police later said nothing suspicious was found in the suitcase. Police were also hunting a 'dangerous' individual who had been released from prison on Monday and had claimed to be associated with Breivik. He was later revealed not to be connected to the suspected mass-murderer. Detectives acted quickly to deny claims Breivik had been in close contact with the fascist English Defence League before carrying out the attacks. Yesterday, it was revealed he had labelled the group as 'a blessing' and wrote online of his desire to attend rallies. Anti-fascist group Searchlight claimed Breivik was in touch with the EDL's Norwegian counterpart, the NDL, using the pseudonym Sigurd Jorsalfare after the 12 century King of Norway who led one of the Crusades. But the EDL has insisted that it has never had 'any official contact' with him and that there is no evidence that he registered as a supporter on the EDL Facebook page. A rambling 1,500-page manifesto written over nine years by Breivik was sent to 250 UK contacts just 90 minutes before he began his attack, a Belgian MP has also revealed. The document was sent to 1,003 email addresses at 2.09pm on Friday and, according to anti-Muslim party Vlaams Belang MP Tanguy Veys, around a quarter of those were UK-based. He told The Guardian: 'I think the UK was the biggest group. There were people from Italy, France, Germany... but the UK was the biggest number.' Suspect: Breivik claimed to have carried out the attacks to free the Western world from 'Islamification' Police officially released the first four names of victims yesterday. Denmark said today that a 43-year-old national, Hanne Balch Fjalestad, had died in the attacks - the first confirmed foreign death. She was working as a medic on the island and leaves behind four children, including a 20-year-old daughter Anna who survived the shooting. Many of those killed were involved in the governing Labour Party, which suspects Breivik was against allowing Muslims to immigrate to Norway. Police identified Gunnar Linakar, 23, a regional secretary of the party's youth wing which organised the camp, and three victims of the bombing: Tove Aashill Knutsen, 56, Hanna M. Orvik Endresen, 61, and Kai Hauge, 33. Grief: 76 people in total were killed during the twin attacks, the majority on Utoya island . Trong Bernsten . Syvert Knudsen . Havard Vederhus . Simon Saebo .

"An incredible 2,500 bookings were taken at David Beckham and Gordon Ramsay's new restaurant within four hours of its website going live - and Friday and Saturday tables are now full until November. The amazing demand for the pair's Union Street Cafe in Southwark, London, suggests the new opening is going to be one of the hottest tables in town this winter. But it seems it won't be alone, as industry experts are expecting an 'unprecedented' boom in new restaurants in the capital over the coming months. Overwhelmed: Gordon Ramsay said he couldn't believe the response his and David beckham's new food venture had received . Airy: An artist's impression of how the Union Street Cafe will look when it opens in September . New eatery: Gordon has joined forces with David Beckham to launch Union Street Cafe which will open next month . Urban feel: The design will incorporate the building's existing industrial-style ceilings and exposed brick . Twenty new establishments in the next four weeks alone are set to open in London, including from former Ramsay protege Jason Atherton, who will be heading up the Berners Tavern at the Editon Hotel in Soho, and Angela Hartnett, who is launching Merchant's Tavern. Next month will also see the relaunch of Boulestin in Mayfair, Koya noodle bar in Soho, Marianne Lumb’s eponymous restaurant in Notting Hill, and serial restaurateur Richard Caring’s latest, Grillshack, also in Soho. According to Adam Hyman, the publisher of restaurant-industry newsletter The CODE Bulletin, the number of openings is without precedent in recent years. He told the Independent: 'There are usually quite a few launches in September, as restaurateurs traditionally hold off until people return from their holidays and London Fashion week begins – but this year it’s a step beyond. We’re not just talking chain openings either – you are seeing a growth in both fine dining and casual restaurants, too.' Chef Jason Atherton is opening up a new venture in Soho, one of a number of top names opening eateries in what industry experts are calling an 'unprecedented' boom in new ventures . Two demographics in particular are driving the resurgence, according to Hyman. 'First you have the increasingly important 25 to 34-year-olds, who consider eating out a replacement hobby, and spend a large proportion of their disposable income on eating in informal places in Soho and east London. Then you have wealthy businessmen from Europe, Russia and Japan who are driving the high-end boom in places like St James’s.' The level of growth underlines the capital's disconnection from the rest of UK’s service economy, according to Neil Gerrard, restaurants editor at Caterer and Hotelkeeper magazine. He said: 'London is the real focus. The economy in the capital has remained buoyant throughout the recession and consumer confidence with it – that is only increasing, too. London is now the great testing ground for new eating concepts.' Other experts say central London is highly attractive for overseas investors, especially from the Middle East and Russia, who see it as a safe haven with lots of high-spending consumers. Some restaurateurs, however, complain that the growth is unsustainable because of a lack of staff.  Dan Doherty, head chef at Duck and Waffle in London’s Bishopsgate, said many workers don't see the industry as able to provide a viable long-term career. Fred Sirieix, the general manager of Michelin-starred Galvin at Windows, pictured, has started National Waiters Day, to try to draw people to the the industry amid fears of staff shortages . Fred Sirieix, the general manager of Michelin-starred Galvin at Windows, has started National Waiters Day, to try to draw people to the profession. 'What we need is a big shout to all the UK people: ""Come and join the hospitality industry"",'  he said. 'It’s the land of opportunity.' Ramsay, though, has no such worries. Speaking of Union Cafe's allure, he said: 'In London right now we’re spoilt with the . range and sheer number of phenomenal restaurants available, so it’s . amazing to see the response today when bookings opened. 'We can’t wait to get the doors open and start welcoming guests.' There's still another few weeks . before David Beckham and Gordon Ramsay's new business venture will be . ready to be seen by the public. However, London's foodies have been given a sneak peek at what to expect when the stars' new restaurant Union Street Café opens in September with these illustrations. This move into the restaurant . business is the first of many new ventures David will no doubt be taking . now that his footballing career is over. As a partner in . Gordon's latest food establishment in Borough, just south of the Thames, . he is no doubt one of the biggest draws for budding diners hoping to . grab a table at their place. Artists impressions of the café show an attic feel with factory-style windows, exposed brick and furniture in neutral colours. Designed by Russell Sage - who also . created the interior of Ramsay's Bread Street Kitchen - the space has . been influenced by the local area of SE1 and has been described as an . 'urban warehouse destination' which will offer Mediterranean-influenced . food with ingredients sourced from nearby Borough Market and directly . from the continent. The food will be cooked in an open theatre-style kitchen so diners could watch the chefs in action. Located on the corner of Union Street and Great Suffolk Street in Southwark, it's a short walk from the famous market, London Bridge train station and The Shard, with neighboring buildings including the Union Jack pub and the Union Theatre. Destination dining: The cafe will be located in the Borough area of London, a short walk from Borough Market . Announcing the venture back in February, Gordon enthused: 'We're really excited to be opening Union . Street Café in September and it’s great that David wants to come on . board and be partner. 'We've been working on the new site, which . is near Borough Market, for the past couple of years and the amazing . large warehouse space will offer quality Mediterranean-influenced food . with a daily changing menu.' He joked: 'David Beckham is going to be my sous chef.' Still a way to go yet: The cafe's official Twitter feed showed the site on Tuesday . The Union Street Café will be Gordon's first new venture without his former business partner, Chris Hutchenson, father of his wife Tana, who he parted ways from several years ago. Although the building isn't quite ready for furniture just yet, a photo on the eaterie's Twitter feed showed the progress so far. A tweet on Tuesday said: 'Cables, cables everywhere! Coming along nicely - not long to go now.' Union Street Café will open at 47-51 Great Suffolk Street, London SE1 0BS on 16 September. New career: David was spotted visiting the site in early July with wife Victoria .","Friday and Saturday tables at Union Street Cafe fully booked until November .

"All but one of a five-member panel that oversees the controversial Vatican bank has been fired by Pope Francis. Four cardinals were given their marching orders by Francis on Wednesday. Those sacked were former Secretary of State, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone SDB, Cardinals Odilo Scherer from Brazil, Telesphore Toppo from India and Domenico Calcagno, from within the Vatican. Clear out: Pope Francis has sacked four of his Vatican bank cardinals, according to a newspaper . Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran, head of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, kept his job, according to The Tablet. The Catholic paper explained that with the exception of Calcagno, the cardinals were all just eleven months into a second, five-year term, having been appointed by Benedict XVI. The Vatican bank was caught in a money-laundering row in 2010 after Italian prosecutors uncovered allegedly suspicious financial activity within the organisation. Bank chairman Ettore Gotti Tedeschi and his deputy Paolo Cipriani were investigated after financial police seized 23million euros from a Vatican bank account. Fired: Former Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone was one of those who lost his job . It was claimed that even as the bank was claiming to tackle money-laundering, it broke the law by trying to transfer money without identifying the sender or recipient, or what the money was being used for. It was an accusation furiously denied by the Vatican. Francis may not be showing much love for his banking cardinals, but he is for engaged couples, as he’s extended an invitation to them to spend Valentine’s Day with him. A note, entitled 'The Joy of Yes Forever' issued by Vatican city invites engaged, heterosexual couples to a private audience with the Pontiff next month. Organised by the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Family, participants are required to register by January 30 to secure their place.

"Towering over rural Cheshire, passing motorists could be forgiven for screaming for help from the Doctor. A huge 35ft Dalek has appeared in a field next to the A51, seemingly intent on world domination. But even though its fearsome plunger looks set to exterminate, the people of Nantwich can sleep soundly in their beds instead of hiding behind the sofa. A Dalek made out of straw is dominating fields in rural Cheshire, if not taking over the world as the greatest enemy in Doctor Who may like to do . Staff at Snugburys ice cream shop near Nantwich create a large straw sculpture every year and chose to mark the show's 50th anniversary for 2013's offering . The cyborg is made out of six tons of straw and five tons of steel and is the latest offering from staff at a nearby ice cream parlour. Each year, the team at Snugburys Ice Cream Farm, Hurleston, celebrates the summer with a new straw sculpture which is usually related to something newsworthy at the time. This year, they're marking the 50th anniversary of BBC favourite Doctor Who - and the most-feared of the Doctor's many enemies will even come to life and move, awakening childhood memories for many. The series itself will mark the occasion with a special edition of the show in November before the Eleventh Doctor Matt Smith leaves the programme at the end of the year. Celebrations have already begun in Cheshire, where the sculpture is expected to draw in visitors until the end of the year and will even be decorated for Christmas. Some of the company's Facebook fans speculated that this year's creation would mark the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's child, Prince George. But devoted Whovians had other ideas. Hannah Sadler of Snugburys said: 'We were absolutely inundated with Doctor Who suggestions from customers coming into the shop and emailing and writing on Facebook. It has taken two days to get the Dalek to its full height, with straw stuffed into a steel structure before being moved into place by a crane . The body of the Dalek takes shape, helped by a team of 13 to get it to its full 35ft height . 'We just thought: a Dalek in that field would look amazing.' The annual event started in 1998 when staff built a huge Millennium Dome sculpture from hay. Since then, they've taken on the London Eye, Big Ben, the Angel of the North and the Lovell telescope at the nearby Jodrell Bank observatory, among others. Last year they celebrated last year's Olympics and Paralympics games with a cyclist racing around a straw velodrome. This year, engineer Mike Harper, 54, decided to go one better than previous years and animate the giant model. He designed the sculpture with Snugburys director Chris Sadler, 60, and then worked out how to make it  bit more like its television counterpart. The head of the Dalek, seen being lifted into place, will move around once the sculpture and its electronics are completed today . The eye of the Dalek will light up and possibly scare a few Whovians who come to see the 35ft sculpture for themselves . Thanks to Mr Harper, the Dalek's eye will light up and its head and plunger will move. The familiar cry of 'exterminate!' will also ring out across the fields. Snugburys will also sell a Da-lick ice cream cone in the parlour to raise money for charity. A percentage of the cone's sales will be donated to Cancer Research UK to support a member of the dairy's staff whose father is undergoing cancer treatment. In 2004, the Snugburys team created their own Angel of the North out of straw - and even gave it a cone . The following year, the London Eye relocated to Cheshire for the summer, becoming a straw North West Eye . In 2009, Big Ben spent the parliamentary summer break as 'Steve Ben', which at 70ft was a quarter of the size of the real thing . In 2010, a 36ft meerkat, made popular that year by an insurance company's adverts, watched over drivers .","The Doctor's greatest enemy has appeared near A51 in rural Cheshire .

"Tearful mourners have gathered in Mozambique for the funeral of a taxi driver who died after being handcuffed to a police patrol car and dragged through the streets in South Africa. Shocking video footage captured the moment Mido Macia, 27, was attacked by officers for allegedly blocking the road and resisting arrest before the van speeds off in front of a crowd of onlookers. He was found dead two hours later in a police cell in Daveyton, South Africa. 'We are revolted, not just angry. It was torture what happened to him,' said a friend of Mr Macia, Xinguinhane Vuma, at his funeral today. Thousands of mourners attended the funeral of 'humble' Mr Macia in Mozambique . There were emotional scenes as the prayers were read and the coffin lowered into the ground at the funeral . One mourner told AP the community in Mozambique does not feel compassion for those who killed Mr Macia . Friends and family have demanded justice for the death of former taxi driver and immigrant Mido Macia . 'Our feeling is very deep. We hope he rests in peace,' Mr Vuma said at the graveside. Nine police officers have been charged . with his murder and they will again appear in court on Monday as their . bail hearing continues. Mr Macia's widow and parents were among a large crowd who attended his funeral in the Matola district of Mozambique, west of the capital city Matola today. His coffin arrived in Mozambique during the night, and mourners . could view his body before the funeral at the Nelson Mandela primary . school nearby. It was draped in flowers and prayers were said before it was lowered into the ground. Ana Carlos Maposse, a resident of Matola,said the community does not feel compassion for those who killed Mr Macia. At the same time, human rights campaigners staged a rally in front of the South African embassy in Mozambique to protest again Mr Macia's death. The crowd chanted 'Down with xenophobia' and brandished banners with the words 'Stop Humiliating Mozambicans' and 'Mido Macia forever'. The scandal is only the latest to undermine confidence in South Africa's police, heaping yet more shame on a . force that opened fire on striking workers at the Marikana platinum . mine in August last year, killing 34 people. Friends described him as a humble man and spoke of the profound shock his death has caused in the community of Matola Rio where his father is a local leader. Around 2,000 people attended the funeral, among them several government officials and Mozambican liberation hero and elder statesman Marcelino dos San . Human rights protesters demonstrated outside the South African embassy at the same time as Mr Macia's funeral . Demonstrators staged a rally to voice their anger at the death of Mr Macia who was an immigrant in South Africa . It also comes as the Oscar Pistorius murder trial puts the country’s criminal justice system in the spotlight. Mr Macia was arrested in the Daveyton . township outside Johannesburg on Tuesday evening. An anonymous witness . told a local newspaper: ‘[Police] argued with Macia and then they beat . him up. ‘They handcuffed him to the back of the van and slammed the door in his face. ‘With blood running down his face they . drove off. He was in pain. He cried and asked the cops to stop but they . continued anyway.’ The death of Mido Macia, pictured with his sister Melida, has caused outrage in South Africa . A still from the video footage of South African police officers handcuffing Mr Macia to a patrol van . A post-mortem found that Mr Macia died of hypoxia and had lacerations to his head . South Africa’s Independent Police . Investigative Directorate, which has launched an investigation, said the . probable cause of death was head injuries with internal bleeding. Spokesman Moses Dlamini said . investigators had been told Mr Macia was asked to move his minibus taxi . by two policemen because it was blocking the road. Mr Macia then allegedly assaulted one . of the officers and took his gun, before officers managed to put the . ‘resisting suspect’ into the van to go to the cells. A prisoner who was in the police station said: ‘They killed him. They beat him up so badly in here.’ The incident has prompted a  furious . backlash in South Africa. Frans Cronje from the South African Institute . of Race Relations think-tank said: ‘It is a level of barbarity on a par . with police behaviour at Marikana. ‘We strongly support the police use of force to meet the criminal onslaught. ‘But this is an ill-disciplined and . brutal rabble that have lost all respect for themselves, their jobs, the . societies they work in.’ The footage of Mr Macia's treatment by South African police has sparked mass protests and worldwide condemnation .","Widow and parents of Mido Macia attend emotional service in Mozambique .

The brooch and bracelet were bought by Edward VIII, the Duke of Windsor, in the late 1950s when he and his wife were living in exile in France following his controversial abdication. The Duchess of Windsor had a love of fine jewellery and she was showered with expensive gifts by Edward. Scroll down for video . The bejewelled tigers were made by Cartier out of onyx, diamond and emerald . The brooch and bracelet (pictured) were bought by Edward VIII, the Duke of Windsor, in the late 1950s . Following her death in 1986, her enormous jewellery collection was sold off in a landmark auction held in Geneva. One of the bidders was composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, who snapped up the tiger brooch and bracelet made from onyx, diamond and emerald as a present for his then wife Sarah Brightman. The gift celebrated the couple's success in the hit musical Phantom of the Opera, which Lloyd Webber wrote and Brightman starred in. Brightman, 54, the world's most successful classical singer, is now selling the jewellery through London auctioneers Christie's with a price tag of £1.5 million. The Duchess of Windsor (formerly Miss Wallis Simpson) at the party which marked the Gala Opening of the new Lido Revue in Paris in 1959 wearing the tiger bracelet . Edward and Wallis's love affair and marriage -which forced his abdication as King- shocked the nation . A Christie's spokesman said: 'The Cartier Tiger Collection has been a highlight of 20th century jewellery design since it first appeared in 1928. 'The rarity of these pieces is enhanced by the story behind their ownership – two romantic tales where they became symbols of love through the act of giving. Sarah Brightman, wife of Andrew Lloyd Wedbber, wearing both the broach and bracelet . 'Edward VIII was King for less than a year when he abdicated in 1936 to marry Wallis Simpson. 'Living in France, together they created a remarkable collection of avant-garde jewels that defined the style of the 1940s and 1950s. 'These pieces were bought by the Duke and Duchess of Windsor from Cartier between 1956 and 1959. 'In the legendary sale of her collection in 1987 in Geneva a total of seven Great Cats pieces by Cartier were offered, including the two tiger pieces now presented for sale. 'It was at this auction that Andrew Lloyd Webber bought them for his then wife, Sarah Brightman. 'They were a present to her to celebrate the huge London and Broadway success of The Phantom of the Opera, which he wrote and in which she starred. 'Over the years, the jewels have brought immense joy to Ms. Brightman, who would now like to release them to new splendour in order for others to appreciate them as she did.' Some of the proceeds of the sale will be donated to the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation which supports arts and music in schools. The auction will take place on November 11 in Geneva. Few could have imagined, as the 20th century dawned, that an American socialite would prove the cause of the biggest constitutional crisis the Royal Family has ever faced. But Wallis Simpson was no ordinary socialite and her future husband Edward VIII, no ordinary king. The pair met in January 1934 and twice-divorced Simpson and the then Prince of Wales swiftly fell in love. At first the relationship raised few concerns, Edward was notorious for his affairs with society ladies, but that all changed when George V died on January 20, 1936. When, the next day, the new King-Emperor chose to watch the proclamation of his accession in the company of Simpson, it became clear that he intended to marry her. This precipitated a crisis, firstly because the political establishment considered a twice-divorced woman an unsuitable consort, and secondly, because Edward was now head of the Church of England, which at the time, did not allow marriages between divorcees. Edward suggested a morganatic marriage which would have prevented Simpson becoming Queen Consort, but the prime ministers of the UK, Australia and South Africa rejected the plan. By early December, the true nature of Simpson's relationship with the King had become public knowledge and she fled the country. Despite attempts by Simpson to get him to reconsider, on December 13, 1936, Edward abdicated and was succeeded by his brother, George VII. The couple eventually married, a month after Wallis' second divorce was granted, on the June 3, 1937 in the south of France. Although Edward had been created the Duke of Windsor by his brother and was entitled to the style 'His Royal Highness', his wife was refused the honour and was styled instead as 'Her Grace.'","Tigers created by Cartier out of diamonds, onyx and emeralds .

"A criminal investigation has been launched into the death of Peaches Geldof as it was revealed she died after taking heroin. Police yesterday said they want to know who supplied the 25-year-old journalist and TV personality with the drug. There are also serious questions over why there was no drug-taking paraphernalia in her home by the time authorities arrived. Scroll down for video . Heroin was said to have played a role in the death of Peaches Geldof, an inquest has heard. Peaches' mother Paula Yates died from an accidental overdose in 2000, aged 41 . DCI Paul Fotheringham confirmed the drug 'contributed' to her death during a short statement as the inquest into the mother-of-two's death opened . Detectives could now question her . husband, musician Thomas Cohen, who was the first person to find her . body before raising the alarm, saying he could not revive her. The . investigation was begun as the opening of an inquest into the death . yesterday confirmed that Peaches had died after taking a potentially . lethal hit of heroin while in sole charge of her baby son Phaedra.

On . the day of her death, Peaches had posted a picture of herself as a . young girl with her late mother – although she was said to have been her . ‘normal self’ before the incident. Kent . Police detective chief inspector Paul Fotheringham told the inquest she . had been making ‘plans for the future’, but that ‘recent use of heroin . and the levels identified were likely to have played a role in her . death’. After Peaches was . found on Monday, April 7, police said the death was unexplained but . ruled out any suggestion of third party involvement. However, . because no drug  paraphernalia was found at the scene, there are now . questions over who supplied the heroin and whether there was a clear-up . before authorities arrived.

They added that no one had yet been arrested or interviewed under caution over the death. A spokesman confirmed, however, that the force was probing the supply of the drugs likely to have killed Peaches. Peaches’s family did not attend yesterday’s ten-minute hearing, with the full inquest expected to begin in late July.

Astala, 23 months, and 11-month-old Phaedra in Wrotham, Kent. Mr Cohen, . 23, had left his wife alone at the £1million property four days . beforehand to spend the weekend at his parents’ home in south-east . London. It was said to be a . regular arrangement that allowed the couple to focus on their work. While she was in the house, Peaches remained in constant contact with . family and friends and was making plans for the future, said Mr . Fotheringham. At 5pm the . night before the tragedy, Mr Cohen’s father Keith took Phaedra back to . Wrotham and spent half an hour with Peaches before leaving. The . last contact with her is thought to have been at 7.45pm that evening, . when she had a  telephone conversation with a friend. ‘All of the . friends and family who had contact with Peaches during this period . described how she seemed her normal self and was making plans for the . future, including a family outing for her sons for the following . weekend,’ Mr Fotheringham added. ‘There was no cause for concern.’ Police officers attend the home of Peaches Geldof in Wrotham, Kent, shortly after she was found dead earlier this month . The . following morning, Mr Cohen could not get hold of his wife and decided . to return home with his mother, Sue, and his other son, Astala, at about . 1.30pm. After discovering his wife’s body, he screamed out to his . mother and rushed to find his baby son before calling 999 five minutes . later. Mr Fotheringham added: ‘Thomas entered the property and went upstairs thinking that Peaches may have been sleeping. ‘Thomas . then located Peaches in a spare bedroom and it was obvious to him that . she was deceased.  She was located on the edge of a bed with one leg . hanging down to the floor with the other leg tucked underneath her; she . was slumped forward across the bed.’ Police and paramedics arrived and confirmed she had died.

The . 25-year-old had recently spoken of feeling the presence of her late . mother keenly as she walked down the aisle of St Mary Magdalene and St . Lawrence Church. Speaking to . Aga Living magazine, published in the Sunday Times, Peaches said she . felt her TV presenter mother was 'living through me all the time because . we are just so similar'.

In . a tragic final interview the late star said it was through being a . mother that she had reconciled herself with her memories of her own . mother, Paula Yates, who died in 2000 at 41 from an accidental heroin . overdose. Explaining that . being a mother to her two sons - Astala, two, and one-year-old . Phaedra - had allowed her to achieve a new understanding of the world, . she said: 'I'm not sure I've yet fully made peace with my childhood, but . with my mum I have come to terms with everything. 'There . are so many parallels between us. Now I can understand everything. I . think you have to experience hardships and pain yourself to fully . understand people who have been through it and also you can never really . experience happiness unless you've had that down feeling too.'

"A mother has described the moment she battled to save the life of her 19-month-old son as he choked to death on a lollipop. Tyler Stanton was sucking the sweet when he ran from the bathroom and 'launched himself' onto the sofa which caused it to become lodged in his throat. An inquest heard his mother Zoe Jones, 23, desperately tried to clear the toddler's airway but only managed to snap the stick clean off. Tyler Stanton, from Rushall, West Midlands, was sucking the sweet when it became lodged in his throat . Tyler's grandfather then tried to resuscitate the youngster using CPR as an ambulance rushed to the house in Rushall, West Midlands. Paramedics arrived at the scene and used an emergency defibrillator in a bid to revive the toddler after he lost consciousness. But sadly nothing could be done to save Tyler, who was pronounced dead at Walsall Manor Hospital on April 26 last year. Sandwell Coroners Court was told a post-mortem found the remains of the lollipop still lodged in the back of his throat and the child's lungs had collapsed. Mother-of-two Miss Jones, who now lives in Bloxwich, West Midlands, told the inquest of the moment she fought to save her child. She said: 'He came running in from the bathroom with the lollipop in his mouth and he then launched himself onto the settee. Tyler, who was pronounced dead at Walsall Manor Hospital (pictured) on April 26, last year . Tyler's mother Zoe Jones, 23, desperately tried to clear the tot's airway but only managed to snap the stick clean off . 'I didn't see it happen, but my friend Emma shouted ""quick, he's choking"". We tried to get the lollipop out but just the stick came out, the rest was still in his mouth. 'I got the stick out but the rest wasn't attached - it was attached at first then when we pulled the stick it came off. I panicked. 'I called for an ambulance straight away as Tyler couldn't breathe. And the sweet was still stuck at that time. Tyler had no health problems. He was able to run and walk about. He was lively.' The tragedy occurred while family and friends were visiting Miss Jones, Tyler and her four-year-old daughter in the home they shared with Tyler's father Greg Stanton, 23. A post-mortem examination also found a brown-like liquid in the back of his throat, which was likely to be regurgitated gastric fluid. A report, which was read out in open court, said that Tyler was 'normally grown for his age' and was also 'fit and healthy'. The pathologist also found no evidence of any head traumas or abnormalities. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Black Country Coroner Robin Balmain gave the medical cause of death as airway obstruction due to a foreign body. He said: 'This is a tragedy. This little boy has had an accident and that is what shall be reflected in my conclusion.' Addressing Miss Jones, he added: 'I'm really sorry this has happened to you. I can't imagine what you were going through at the time.' Miss Jones did not want to comment after the hearing but her stepmother, who didn't want to be named, added: 'I saw him all the time. 'He was a healthy little boy. I cannot believe it happened to him - it's not yet sunk in.'","Tyler Stanton was sucking the sweet when he jumped onto a sofa at home .

The men were nose-to-nose when Duggins allegedly threatened the driver, 'If you hit me in the face, we will fight to the death.' When Weigelt tried to shove him off the bus in Washington, Duggins pushed him onto a seat and repeatedly smashed his face before telling him that he wanted to taste his blood.

"Number crunching slave master? 53-year-old Florida accountant Timothy Deegan was arrested Friday on charges he enslaved three women in his Gainesville home for months . A Florida accountant was arrested last week after police say they discovered he'd spent months living with three women he kept trapped as his personal sex slaves. Officials also claim that 53-year-old Gainesville CPA Timothy Deegan was prostituing the women while keeping them on a tight leash with promises of cocaine and threats of violence. For months, police allege Deegan monitored the three women with hidden cameras, raped them, pimped them out and put footage of their sex acts on the internet. All the while, average families were living their comfortable cul-de-sac lives all around him. Deegan was booked on three counts of human trafficking by Alachua County officials on Friday, reports the Gainesville Sun. It was the end to months of hell for the women, who were sex workers who'd had the misfortune of meeting Deegan in 2013. At first, authorities say Deegan would record the women having sex with each other and put the footage online. But . slowly, the Gainesville Sun notes, the women became increasingly . fearful of the accountant as he took more and more control of their . lives. He . fed them drugs, threatened them with guns and homemade weapons and even . set up booby traps throughout his home and took the knobs off doors. Police . records show that Deegan monitored their movements using the GPS . function on their phones and would call them with threats if they . ventured too far. 'He . was basically prostituting them out, in exchange for the money and the . sex and the drugs,' said Alachua County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson . Sergeant Becky Butscher told MyFoxOrlando. Beyond the circular driveway: Neighbors called Deegan's home one of the neighborhoods most striking. Little did they know it was allegedly a house of horrors where the sick CPA forced women to have sex on camera and monitored their every move . Their . relationship with Deegan had begun with the promise of drugs and had . devolved into a life of sexual servitude, claim police. 'They . stayed, because they were afraid. He made traps, he watched their every . move. He kept them addicted to drugs,' Sergeant Butcher said. The . women even stayed after one of them managed to get Deegan arrested . after she allegedly found a video he'd taken of himself raping her as . she lay unconscious from sleep medication. Now that sexual assault charge from December 2013 has been rolled in to the human trafficking charges Deegan has against him. He remained jailed Wednesday in lieu of $300,000 bond. Now, . people like George Shorter of the area homeowner's association have . been forced to think in wonder at how ignorant they were of the horrors . behind Deegan's well-kept home's facade. Fear and cocaine: Deegan reportedly monitored the women, who he met on a website for sex workers, using tiny video cameras and GPS on their phones. The women say he forced them to have sex with him and other men against their will as he plied them with fear and cocaine. In the Facebook photo at t left, Deegan is pictured with an unknown woman in 2012 . 'I hate to say it but the shocking thing is we really knew so little about what went on in his house. It's maintained from the outside. It's one of the distinct properties in the neighborhood,' Shorter told the Gainesville Sun. Shorter wondered why, after the December sex assault charge, the neighbors didn't know more. 'The first incident...happened months and months ago,' he said. 'And he kept returning, and more things would happen. 'A lot of us are questioning, why was this guy allowed to come back and live in our community?'","Timothy Deegan has one of the nicest homes in his posh Gainesville, Florida neighborhood that police say he made into a depraved prison .

"A Muslim convert was heard chanting that he wanted to kill non-believers hours before going on a knife rampage and trying to kill a police officer and firemen. The man was Tasered multiple times by police after launching his attack on a busy street. Officers were called around midday yesterday when the knifeman, armed with four blades, attempted to smash his way into  a neighbours’s property with an iron bar. Hours earlier he had been heard reciting verses from the Koran and making threats ‘to kill Kuffars’. Terrifying: Officers chased the subject down Falcon Road in Battersea, south-west London . Firemen at a nearby fire station in . Battersea, South London, confronted the 26-year-old after seeing him . throwing bottles at neighbours and threatening passers-by with kitchen . knives. But he went berserk and chased the firemen back to the station, where he attempted to batter down the doors. Within . minutes more than 20 police officers had arrived at the scene, blocking . off the road as the man sprinted up and down smashing police car . windows and screaming abuse. Hacked to death: The rampage has revived memories of the slaying of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, South London . Terrified onlookers cowered in local shops as police tried to contain him using a Taser. The . rampage has revived memories of the slaying of Fusilier Lee Rigby, who . was hacked to death in the street by two knife-wielding Muslim radicals . in Woolwich, South London, in May. Police said yesterday’s incident was . not thought to be terror related. Servet Kaplan, 22, a store manager at Battersea Food & Wine, said ‘People were trying to get into my store. ‘There . were so many they wouldn’t fit through the door. I saw the police Taser . the man and it didn’t affect him at all, he just carried on running.’ After 20 minutes officers managed to overpower the man who continued to . lash out, injuring one officer who received minor cuts to his hands. The . suspect, known locally as Michael. was later taken to Springfield . University Hospital in nearby Tooting with minor injuries caused by the . Taser device. He is thought to have been released from Springfield, a psychiatric hospital, two years ago. His . downstairs neighbour Gyare Patrick, 66, said: ‘He has always been . trouble ever since he got here from Springfield two years ago. ‘He . has always ranted and raved, swearing and shouting, ever since he got . here. But in the last three months he has started chanting in Arabic. He . has mental health problems. ‘Today he was chanting kill Kuffars and I’m going to Medina, which means kill non-believers and I’m going to heaven. Chanting: The man was Tasered multiple times by police after launching his attack in broad daylight on a busy London street (file picture) ‘I didn’t take any notice of it because when you live downstairs from someone like that you become immune to it.’ Last night the suspect was being held on suspicion of the attempted murder of a police officer. Chief . Superintendent Paul McGregor said: ‘There were a considerable amount of . people around. The incident bought the place to a standstill. ‘This is a really good example of how important an effective Taser use can be, in the right circumstances. ‘People would have been seriously injured otherwise.

"President Barack Obama's approval rating among the American public has reached an all-time low. Just 41 percent of the country now approves of the job that Obama is doing, down five percent from a month ago, according to a new Washington Post- ABC News poll. Dissatisfaction with healthcare reform continues to play a large role in Americans' disgruntlement with the President. While Republicans are most unhappy with the President's implementation of his signature law, they are not alone in their displeasure. President Barack Obama, who is currently on a week-long trip to Asia, will face an all-time low approval rating upon return . Support for the healthcare law was . upside down, with only 44 percent saying they supported the changes . Obamacare made to the healthcare system, down from 49 percent a month . ago. Approval of Obama's handling of the . healthcare law was predictably split down party lines, but among . self-identified Independents, more than two-thirds strongly disapprove of the . way the President has handled the implementation of his signature law. Among all respondents, only . 37 percent approved of the way Obama is handling the healthcare law, and nearly twice as many respondents strongly disapproved of the . President's implementation of Obamacare as those who . strongly approved  - a mere 24 percent. Worse, just 41 percent of respondents said implementation is going better than expected compared to when it began. Particularly telling of the level of discontent Obama faces over healthcare implementation is the low number of Republicans polled. Republicans only made up only two of every 10 people interviewed. Just 41 percent of the country now approves of the job that Obama is doing, down five percent from a month ago . Implementation . of the healthcare law got off to a notoriously bad start last October. The Obamacare sign up website healthcare.gov repeatedly crashed during . the open enrollment period for the federal health exchanges, making . Obama and his administration, namely Health and Human Services Secretary . Kathleen Sebelius, look foolish. The . last day of Obamacare enrollment, March 31, was plagued with more . problems related to the website's failure to function properly, forcing . the Obama administration to extend sign-up time for Americans who tried . to enroll in healthcare by the government mandated deadline but . couldn't. After . first saying she would remain at the helm of HHS until next fall, . Sebelius announced days later that she would soon leave the . administration. Democrats . had hoped that Sebelius' departure would decrease Americans' annoyance . with Obamacare. Obamacare numbers have only gotten worse, not better, . since Sebelius' announcement, however, as vexation with the poorly . implemented law lingers. This image of Obamacare sign up site HealthCare.gov taken on March 31 is indicative of the problems many Americans trying to sign up for healthcare ran into throughout the winter . At issue for many Americans polled was the perceived cost increases that Obamacare has wreaked on their personal finances. Only eight percent told pollsters they thought their personal health care costs . are going down as a result of Obamacare. Nearly six times as many said . their health care costs were increasing as because of the President's . signature law. Likewise, more than five times as many people said the country's . healthcare costs were going up as a result of Obamacare than those who said they thought national health spending was going down. It's unclear how much of an impact Americans' negative feelings about Obamacare will have on Democratic candidates competing in the nation's mid-term elections in November. Respondents in the poll said they trusted Democrats more to handle nearly every issue, including Obamacare, but pollsters interviewed a significantly higher number of Democrats than Republicans. Of note is that double the percentage . of respondents in the poll thought America was on the wrong track. Of those who felt . America was on the wrong track, they were three times more . likely to blame Democrats in Congress than Republicans.

"With her ribs visible beside her slender arms, anorexic 21-year-old Holly Griffiths looks barely able to carry herself, let alone a growing child. Incredibly, however, she is eight months pregnant, her tiny frame hiding an almost fully-formed baby. Pictures of the young woman, who weighs just 8st 1lb and is 5ft 7in tall, have emerged as she battles to put on weight to keep her unborn child healthy. Holly Griffiths, 21, has battled anorexia since she was a child. She managed to give birth to a healthy baby boy called Dylan (pictured) when she was 19 and now is pregnant with a little girl she has named Isla . Miss Griffiths has struggled with . eating problems for 13 years but has already given birth to one healthy . child, a son called Dylan, now two, despite also risking his life in . pregnancy to keep herself thin. Normally, pregnant women are expected . to consume about 2,000 calories a day but Miss Griffiths makes do with . between 800 and 1,200, eating one slice of toast for breakfast, salad . for lunch, and plain pasta for dinner. She has to see a high-risk maternity . doctor, but a 4D scan of the child, who she has named Isla, shows she . currently looks healthy. Despite being 32 weeks pregnant Miss Griffiths does not look as if she is pregnant at all. She is trying to put on as much weight as possible for her baby before she is induced in three weeks . Holly is carrying a girl that she has named Isla (pictured here in her 20-week scan). Doctors says the baby is doing well and is healthy despite her mother's low weight . A 32-week scan shows Isla's face as she grows into a healthy baby. Miss Griffiths says she is eating energy-rich snacks such as nuts and smoothies to put on weight and provide nutirnts for her baby girl . ‘I know I have to eat for the baby, . but it’s hard to push the voices away that are telling me I’m fat,’ said . Miss Griffiths from Greenwich, South London, who is engaged to the . child’s father, gym manager Harrison Bogbanovs, 24. ‘When I first . discovered I was pregnant I was terrified of having to gain weight . again. ‘I suffered terrible morning sickness which caused my weight to drop, triggering my anorexia . 'I had thoughts of purging but didn’t . need to, my body was reacting in its own way. This made eating a lot . easier, because I would just vomit it up anyway.’ When Miss Griffiths was pregnant with Dylan she was so thin that one of her ribs cracked as the baby grew. Miss Griffiths (pictured, left, age six) developed anorexia when she was eight after ballet classes put pressure on her to lose weight. She has fought the condition for years and has gained a healthy weight for short periods of time. In summer last year she relapsed (right) and plummeted to seven stone despite being 5'7"" She was induced at 37 weeks and gave birth after a labour of only ten minutes. Dylan weighed 5lb 10oz and, to her . relief, was healthy. ‘I was so lucky he was OK,’ she said. ‘I felt so . guilty I had put his life at risk.’ Miss Griffiths was eight when she . started battling with her weight. She blames her condition on the . pressure to look skinny in a leotard while taking ballet classes. By 12 she had been admitted to a children’s psychiatric clinic weighing just 5st 5lb – about 3st underweight. Miss Griffiths admits that when she was told that she was pregnant with her first child Dylan she was terrified. She said she should have been over the moon but was upset she would not longer be able to control her weight . Miss Griffiths (pictured with fiance Harrison Bogbanovs after the birth of Dylan) was so small that when Dylan was in her womb he cracked her rib and started to crush her lungs. Because of this she was induced at 37 weeks . Now, at 34 weeks pregnant, she is . determined to gain 3lb before she gives birth to Isla. It is planned . that she will be induced in three weeks. ‘Thankfully my baby girl is a healthy size and the doctors are happy with my progress,’ she added. ‘I’m desperate to recover so I can teach my kids a healthy way to approach food. 'I couldn’t bear it if they had body issues like me, so I’m continuing to fight the voices in my head and get better for them.’ Dylan was born a healthy, but slightly low, 5lb 10oz and has suffered no ill effects after his mother carried him while battling an eating disorder.

"Natasha Scott-Falber, 14, died earlier this year. Her parents say she was killed by toxic shock syndrome after using a tampon for the first time . A teenager who dreamed of starring in the West End died from an ultra-rare infection after using a tampon for the first time, her heartbroken family have said. Natasha Scott-Falber, 14, died suddenly on Valentine's Day in Caerwent, Wales, five days after she fell ill with what was thought to be the norovirus. Her family now believe the teenager died of toxic shock syndrome - a bacterial infection which affects just 40 people a year in Britain. Posting on Facebook, her family - which includes her mother Mandy Scott, 52, brother Daniel Falber, stepfather Mike Scott and stepmother Linda Falber - have launched a campaign to raise awareness of the condition so other sufferers spot the signs earlier. They said: 'Natasha died of toxic shock syndrome the first time that she used tampons. 'Generally speaking, it is accepted knowledge that leaving a tampon in for too long can cause toxic shock syndrome. In Natasha’s case, she followed all of the instructions and used the tampon correctly; it was simply the introduction of the tampon into her body which caused toxic shock syndrome to take effect. 'Tash became ill five days before she died but remained in good spirits, and only the evening before she died, she was telling Mandy off for fussing over her, and saying that she was feeling much better. 'She died peacefully at approximately 6.45am on Valentine’s Day after falling asleep watching one of her favourite TV programs. Tragedy: Natasha was described as 'beautiful, gifted, funny and kind' and dreamed of starring in the West End . Paige Roffey, 15, said she collapsed from toxic shock syndrome after using a tampon for just four hours. She was initially sent back to her home in Rayleigh, Essex, by doctors who thought she had a virus - but was rushed to Southend hospital after collapsing in the shower. Paige was in a coma for two days and later transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital, with her mother Sarah, 39, sitting beside her bed and planning her funeral. The teenager highlighted the case in 2011 after she returned to school, determined to let others know what had happened and what to look out for. She said: 'I still feel ill some days but I am getting my strength back. I just want it to be a lot more known than it is.' 'We cannot express how much we miss our . beautiful, gifted, kind and funny Natasha. All of our family, and many . others close to us, are still reeling from the shock of losing our . wonderful girl. 'We hope that you and your family never have to go . through what we have gone through, and are still going through.' Natasha, . who was found dead by her father Mike Falber, was described as an . 'all-singing and all-dancing' youngster who enjoyed acting and playing . the guitar. She had been selected last year to perform in a backing choir for English tenor Alfie Boe at one of Wales' most prestigious concert halls, St David's Hall, Cardiff. After Natasha's death it was initially believed she had fallen victim to septicaemia, better known as blood poisoning. Toxic shock syndrome affects about 40 people each year in the UK. The infection is caused when usually harmless . Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus bacteria, which live on the skin, invade the bloodstream and produce dangerous toxins. A statement from BUPA said: 'It's not exactly understood why using a tampon is linked with toxic shock syndrome, but tampon absorbency (the amount of menstrual blood a tampon absorbs) is thought to be a factor. 'If you're a woman using tampons, use a . tampon with the lowest absorbency suitable for your menstrual blood . flow, change your tampon frequently, use a sanitary towel or panty liner . from time to time during your period, never insert more than one tampon . at one time and use a sanitary towel at night instead of a tampon.' The family of Natasha Scott-Falber, left, say she died from toxic shock syndrome after using her first tampon. Essex schoolgirl Paige Roffey, right, said in 2011 that the same condition put her in a coma for two days . The family said: 'We thought that one . thing we could do, to honour Natasha, and to help others, would be to . start an awareness campaign about toxic shock syndrome. 'We . are in communication with Public Health Wales, the two main tampon . companies, and we have already had some success with GPs and with the . education system in Gwent. All the age-appropriate pupils attending . schools in Gwent have been made aware of toxic shock syndrome. 'We are determined to make at least everyone in the UK aware of what the symptoms are, and what the risks are.' Streptococcus bacteria live on the skin . Toxic shock syndrome is a highly dangerous bacterial infection - but it can be misdiagnosed, because the symptoms are the same as other illnesses and because it is so rare. It occurs when usually harmless Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus bacteria, which live on the skin, invade the bloodstream and produce dangerous toxins. This causes a sudden high fever, a massive drop in blood pressure resulting in dizziness and confusion, and occasionally vomiting and diarrhoea. Other symptoms - none of which are exclusive to toxic shock syndrome, which is extremely rare - include a sunburn-like skin rash, the whites of the eyes becoming red or pink and the shedding of the skin in large sheets, especially from the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, one or two weeks after becoming ill. Women . are most at risk of getting toxic shock syndrome during menstruation . and particularly if they are using tampons, have recently given birth, . or are using an internal barrier contraceptive such as a diaphragm.","Natasha Scott-Falber from Caerwent, Wales, found dead on Valentine's Day .

"High street fashion chain Topman has apologised after it emerged that one of its jackets features an emblem worn by the SS, the notorious elite troops of Hitler's Nazi regime. The £205 hooded jacket, part of the 'Horace' range, features the Odal rune, the emblem of ethnic Germans of the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen, which operated during the Second World War. The division operated in the Nazi Germany-sponsored Independent State of Croatia and was infamous for its cruelty.

It committed massive atrocities in Niksic in Montenegro, where troops slaughtered, tortured, or burned to death men, women and children. The Odal is also used by neo-Nazi organisations and other racial supremacist groups. It also appears on a pair of shorts with a similar design to the jacket. The symbol was spotted by a shopper from Hove, East Sussex, who posted a review pointing out the insensitive mistake. It has now been withdrawn from sale.

He said: 'A friend of mine who wears punk-style clothing shared the link with me on Facebook. When I looked more closely I saw the Nazi insignia. 'When I checked to see if Topman had published my review I noticed they had withdrawn the jacket from sale. 'It’s a bit embarrassing for them,' he told the Sunday Mirror. The jacket is made by an outside supplier and was only available online. A Topman spokesman said: 'The jacket was not designed by Topman. We apologise for any offence caused.' Founded in 1925, the 'Schutzstaffel', German for 'protection squad', initially served as Adolf Hitler's personal bodyguards, later becoming one of the most powerful and feared organisations in all of Nazi Germany. Heinrich Himmler, a militant anti-Semite who was later architect of the 'Final Solution', became head of the SS in 1929 and expanded the group's role and size. Recruits had to prove their 'racial purity' and were also taught they were the not only the elite of Nazi Party but also of all humankind. By the start of the Second World War the SS had more than 250,000 members and multiple subdivisions, engaged in activities ranging from intelligence operations to running Nazi concentration camps. The soldiers of the SS committed many atrocities during the war, while the concentration camp system was set up in the 1930s by Theodor Eicke of the SS. Thousands of SS men were also drafted to help exterminate the Jews of Eastern Europe, participating in mass killings or guarding ghetto districts where Jews from the west were concentrated before being sent to death camps. At the end of the war many leading members of the SS - including Himmler - committed suicide. Those that were captured were tried at the Nuremburg war crimes trials.","The £205 jacket features an 'Odal' rune, the insignia of a notorious SS unit .

"The mother of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne has been forced to quit Twitter after years of 'unrelenting' abuse, mainly by trolls delighting in the death of her daughter. Dr Sara Payne endured 'stalking and harassment' online, including by a convicted paedophile, her closest friend has said. Shy Keenan, who is a child protection campaigner said today Ms Payne was 'forced to close down her Twitter account' and called for the suspects to be arrested. The abuse Dr Payne suffered increased in recent weeks, particularly after the death of her ex-husband Michael, 45. Shame: Dr Sara Payne, left, has quit Twitter after unrelenting abuse by trolls, particularly about the murder of her daughter . He died alone in his armchair after being driven to drink and despair by the death of his daughter and his family said he was tortured by 'the fact he wasn't there to protect her'. Their daughter was snatched by paedophile Roy Whiting from a field near her grandparents' home in West Sussex, where she was playing with older brothers Luke and Lee and younger sister Charlotte in 2000. Tragedy: The abuse Dr Payne suffered increased in recent weeks, particularly after the death of her ex-husband Michael, 45, pictured . Mr Payne spoke of his battle with depression in the aftermath of the ordeal, when he suffered recurring nightmares and used alcohol to cope with her death. Michael Payne and his then wife made a series of heart-rending appeals for her safe return, but her body was discovered 16 days later in a shallow grave just a few miles away. Whiting was sentenced to life behind bars in January 2001, in what became one of Britain's most high profile child murder cases. It later emerged that Whiting was already on the Sex Offenders Register after abducting and sexually attacking another eight-year-old. The death of his daughter became one of Britain's most high profile child-murder cases and Mrs Payne later campaigned for ‘Sarah’s Law’. The rule allows concerned parents or grandparents to contact police to find out if a new boyfriend, or a neighbour, who has contact with a child, has a history of child sex offending. Mr and Mrs Payne ended their 18-year marriage three years after the disappearance and both blamed the 'overwhelming' strains of coping with their tragic loss. Sarah's mother, 45, went on to campaign for a change in legislation to allow parents to know if convicted child sex offenders live nearby, known as Sarah's Law. Monster: Roy Whiting loses his temper during a police interview over the murder of Sarah Payne. In 2001 he was jailed for life with no parole . She has been awarded an MBE and an honorary doctorate for her work and told recently how it had given her 'much-needed focus' amid the grief and her severe post-traumatic stress disorder. Mrs Payne also suffered a stroke in 2009 which has left her walking with the assistance of a stick. Sara and Michael Payne pictured outside Lewes Crown Court following the conviction of Whiting . In December 2001, Roy Whiting was sentenced to life in prison with a recommendation that he never be released after a jury found him guilty of the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne. After his conviction was entered, the court heard he had a previous conviction for the kidnap and indecent assault of a nine-year-old girl. The jury, who had been unaware of the previous sex conviction, were told Whiting had been sentenced to four years in jail for the sex attack in June 1995. Revelations Whiting already had a history of child abuse prior to the killing of Sarah prompted a national debate about how paedophiles are dealt with in the justice system. Mr and Mrs Payne began actively campaigning for a law change, piling pressure on ministers to allow people to know about convicted paedophiles living in their area. In the wake of Whiting's sentencing, Mrs Payne said: 'The Government only can make this decision. Right now, we have got a lot of work to do and it doesn't stop here. It just begins. You know what change I want, Sarah's Law.' The rule, eventually introduced in 2011, allows concerned parents or grandparents to contact police to find out if a new boyfriend, or a neighbour, who has contact with a child, has a history of child sex offending. The scheme is a watered-down version of similar laws in the U.S. under which details of where convicted paedophiles live are actively publicised. In 2008, Mrs Payne was awarded an MBE for her tireless campaigning on the issue.","Dr Sara Payne was 'stalked and harassed' - including by a paedophile .

"George Osborne and Ed Balls will join the chiefs of Amazon and Google at a secretive conference, it was revealed last night, as both firms face mounting pressure over their tax avoidance strategies. The Chancellor and his Labour shadow will attend the Bilderberg Conference at the five-star Grove Hotel near Watford, Hertfordshire, along with Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Eric Schmidt of Google. Their names were revealed in a list of 140 politicians, academics and businessmen - including only 14 women - who will this week discuss topics such as ‘cyber warfare’ and ‘jobs, entitlement and debt’. Scroll down for full Bilderberg Conference guest list . Guest list: Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour shadow Ed Balls will attend the Bilderberg Conference . Luxurious: The secretive conference will take place at the five-star Grove Hotel near Watford, Hertfordshire and a major police security operation has started today . Bilderberg - which will also be attended by former Barclays chairman Marcus Agius - has a shadowy reputation which has come under scrutiny in recent years, forcing organisers to be more open. Also attending the event will be former U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger, former Labour minister Lord Mandelson, Cabinet minister Ken Clarke and former foreign secretary Lord Carrington. A Bilderberg spokesman said in a press release: ‘The conference has always been a forum for informal, off-the-record discussions about megatrends and the major issues facing the world. ‘Thanks to the private nature of the conference, the participants are not bound by the conventions of office or by pre-agreed positions. As such, they can take time to listen, reflect and gather insights.’ The conference was founded in 1954 as an annual event designed to foster dialogue between Europe and North America. Between 120 and 150 people take part each year. They will also debate subjects including . ‘can the U.S. and Europe grow faster and create jobs’, ‘how big data is . changing almost everything’, ‘U.S. foreign policy’ and ‘Africa’s . challenges’. Also attending: The names of Amazon's Jeff Bezos (left) and Eric Schmidt (right) of Google were revealed . Last week it was revealed British . taxpayers will have to foot the bill for the ‘exceptional costs’ of . policing the clandestine meeting, which is taking place in Britain for . the first time since 1998. 'Thanks to the private nature of the conference, the participants are not bound by the conventions of office or by pre-agreed positions' Bilderberg spokesman . Given the amount of prestigious names set to attend the event at the luxury hotel, local police have been forced to step up security, which will be part-funded by the government. The cloak of secrecy surrounding the meetings, which ban most journalists from attending, has fuelled various conspiracy theories, including that attendees are plotting world domination. As a result, there are fears that anti-capitalist protesters will cause ‘violence and disturbance’. Google has come under fire in recent weeks over reports that it paid just £10million in corporation tax in Britain between 2006 and 2011, despite revenues of £11.9billion. Amazon said it paid just £2.44million in corporation tax on UK sales of £320million last year - but told investors it in fact turned over 13 times that amount, with British sales of more than £4billion.","Guest list revealed for Bilderberg Conference at Grove Hotel in Watford .

The extravaganza was organized by celebrity wedding planner Preston Bailey, who also oversaw internet entrepreneur Sean Parker’s $10 million ‘Lord of the Rings’-themed wedding to Alexandra Lenas back in June. King James' big day was expected be a slightly more muted affair. The guest list was expected to only number in the hundreds, rather than the thousands that have attended some NBA All-Star’s nuptials. Guests: The couple have been friends with wedding guests Beyoncé and Jay Z for a long time . LeBron's Miami Heat teammate Dwyane Wade and his girlfriend Gabrielle Union, far left, attended . ‘He cut the list down because he didn’t want to have 1,000 people at the wedding,’ a source told the New York Post.

Brinson admitted that there have been plenty of times when she has been bothered by attention, particularly when stories have come out that simply aren't true. 'I've heard things about me that are bad, where they've literally looked up into the sky and said, ""What can they say about Savannah?"" It's going to happen,' Brinson said.

"Princess Beatrice is now a firm fixture on the London social scene, attending a string of charity events, galas and parties every month. But the daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson is clearly still carving out time for her long-term boyfriend Dave Clark. The 26-year-old princess was seen last night with Virgin Galactic executive Clark, 31, enjoying a date night at Berners Tavern just off Oxford Street. Scroll down for video . Princess Beatrice and Dave Clark left the Berners Tavern restaurant at the London Edition hotel last night . Ever the gentleman Daveheld a protective arm around Beatrice as they left the high end restaurant . Beatrice looked slim and stylish in a high-waisted black skirt cinched in at the waist with a wide black belt. She wore a slinky black peasant style shirt on top - leaving several buttons undone to reveal a flash of décolletage. Sticking to black, the princess wore a pair of stilettos and carried a small sequinned clutch, leaving her hair loose. Dave looked more casual than his royal beau in a pair of jeans, unbuttoned shirt, blazer and trainers. The princess wore a slinky black peasant style shirt on top - leaving several buttons undone to reveal a flash of décolletage . The pair have been dating for over six years, and gossip is rife - denied by all concerned, naturally - that theirs might be the next royal engagement to be announced. Last month, Beatrice's mother Sarah Ferguson spent the weekend at Balmoral as a guest of Her Majesty, accompanied by her ex-husband and their two daughters, leading some to speculate on the reasons for this royal rapprochement. Ever the gentleman, Dave held a protective arm around Beatrice as they left the high end restaurant, which is situated inside the London Edition hotel just off Oxford Street. Berners Tavern, which serves up such culinary delights as crispy pigs head, fois gras and black pudding, watercress and pickled onion salad, or macaroni and cheese with braised ox cheek brioche and bone marrow crumble, is very much in keeping with Beatrice’s normal choice of restaurant. The princess is known to frequent A-list favourites such as Chiltern Firehouse, Zuma, Nobu, Restaurant C and Balthazar. Beatrice looked decidedly slim in a high-waisted black skirt cinched in at the waist with a wide black belt . But alongside all the high-end partying and expensive dining, Beatrice often donates her time to good causes. Last week on September 11 the young royal tried her hand at investment banking in London at the annual BGC Charity Day; selling shares for a good cause, while commemorating the bank's employees who perished on 9/11. The daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson joined a slew of celebrities as she brokered deals on the phone joining the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Dynamo, Stephen Fry and Jack Whitehall, as each celebrity raised money for their chosen charity. David Gandy, Yasmin Le Bon, Clive Owen, Amanda Holden and James Haskell also gave brokering a go for a good cause.","Beatrice and Dave left Berners Tavern in London Edition Hotel .

"Action: Foreign Secretary William Hague said . today that Britain could provide experts to help seize the Syrian . government's chemical weapons stockpiles . Britain is willing to send experts to Syria to help seize its government's chemical weapons stockpiles but will not send soldiers to protect them, said William Hague today. The Foreign Secretary said that sending British troops might 'create strong feelings' within Syria and suggested that alternative security arrangements would be looked at. Under an agreement between the U.S. and Russia, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad's regime is required to submit a full inventory of its chemical stockpile by the end of the week. That's the first deadline in a timetable to allow international inspectors into the country by November and complete the surrender of its arsenal by mid-2014. It comes after UN inspectors confirmed that said there was ‘clear and convincing evidence’ that deadly sarin gas was used in the attack on a Damascus suburb that killed hundreds of people, many of them children. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the evidence suggested the incident was the world’s worst chemical weapons attack for 25 years, when Saddam Hussein used them in Hallabja in 1988, killing 5,000. ‘This is a war crime and a grave violation of international law,’ Mr Ban said. ‘The results are overwhelming and indisputable. The facts speak for themselves.’ Although the UN report did not say who was to blame, Mr Hague has said the its findings backed the West's claims that Syrian government forces were behind the attack. The Foreign Secretary told the BBC today that he now hopes a UN security resolution enshrining the Syrian regime's responsibility to hand over its chemical weapons stocks will be drawn up over the weekend. Asked if British troops could be deployed to Syria, Mr Hague told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'No. We will not be sending British troops into Syria. 'Not for these or any other circumstances. We won't be sending boots on the ground, deploying boots on the ground in Syria.' 'I don't think that would be a good way to provide security inside Syria, given that might create strong feelings within Syria, so that would have to be provided in a different way.' 'Clear and convincing evidence': Professor Ake . Sellstrom, head of the chemical weapons team working in Syria, hands . over the report on the Al-Ghouta massacre to United Nations Secretary-General Ban . Ki-moon . On the issue of sending British experts, Mr Hague said: 'Well, we're open to that. We would want to be confident about their security. 'I think all countries that have expertise in this area should be ready to use it, to deploy it as part of an international team.' When asked again on the matter of sending UK experts if there was a requirement, the Foreign Secretary confirmed: 'We'd be willing to do so.' Mr Hague said there has to be confidence that the people dealing with the weapons are secure. Chemical weapons: People walk in a narrow alley past a poster featuring Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian capital, Damascus. The UN report into the atrocity does not appear to have apportioned blame . He continued: 'Of course, all the areas concerned are in regime hands. Interestingly, given all the debate in the past about whether this was the regime or the opposition, there is no consideration being given to securing chemical weapons held by the opposition because nobody actually believes they've got any. 'Even the Russians are not discussing the declaration and destruction of opposition-held chemical weapons because even they don't think they really exist. 'So this is all about places in regime-held territory. It should be possible to make security arrangements but again this is a perfectly legitimate question, but that all remains to be sorted out in the coming days. 'I hope the OPCW (Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) will come to its decision by the end of the week. We'll then be working on agreeing a security council resolution over the weekend. 'Of course, those timetables might slip but we're looking at days, not weeks.' Massacre: Syrian activists inspect the bodies of people they say were killed by nerve gas in the Ghouta region, in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus, Syria . Earlier the Foreign Secretary said UK involvement will depend on the arrangements made by the OPCW and what is agreed at the security council. He said: 'We do have experts in these matters in the UK. When the inspectors went in in the last few weeks, the Syrian regime wouldn't agree to have anybody from the UK or the US.' Questioned on whether the Syrian regime still has the right to make such refusals, Mr Hague said: 'That depends on the terms of the resolution, the work of the OPCW.' Mr Hague said he did not think it would be the case that Assad could choose who comes to look at his chemical weapons. He said: 'But that, of course, is all being sorted out and what he is not able to choose now is whether to declare there's chemical weapons and to get rid of them. 'So this is undoubtedly an advance compared to where we were a few weeks ago.'","Foreign Secretary says sending British troops might 'create strong feelings'

In it's first year it was nominated in the Best Drama section and in it's second year Dame Maggie Smith won a nomination for best supporting actress. But this year Downton Abbey has failed to pick up a single nomination at the BAFTA Television Awards. The lack of acknowledgement for the third series, which received a mix reception at the time, has led to speculation that the fourth series of the stately home drama will be it's last. Scroll down for a list of nominees . No acknowledgment: The latest series of Downton Abbey did not receive any BAFTA nominations for the first time . It is thought that the show, which was one of the most-watched throughout the whole of 2012, has suffered after a number of the key stars have left, including Dan Stevens who played Matthew Crawley. The news comes as the BBC has overtaken ITV in terms of nominations, receiving five times the amount of the channel on which Downton is aired, with TV film The Girl and crime series The Accused leading the nominations. The BBC-HBO co-produced movie The Girl, about the tumultuous relationship between director Alfred Hitchcock and actress Tippi Hedren, has received nods in four categories.

"Newly-released footage shows the series of events leading up to a teen girl being shot dead by police  early Saturday morning while leaving a party. Dashcam video shows Boone County Sheriff's Deputy Tyler Brockman trying to stop Samantha Ramsey, 19, of Hebron, Kentucky - but it does not show him jumping on the hood or firing the shots that took her life. The 48 minute video released to WLWT shows Brockman approaching the car and Ramsey not stopping. The shooting occurred off camera but friends hysterical reactions are clearly shown. Scroll down for video . Ramsey was attempting to leave a field party along the Ohio River when Deputy Tyler Brockman (pictured) tried to stop her car to determine whether she was impaired . She does not stop: Ramsey's car keeps moving despite being approached by the police officer . The car is seen leaving the field where the party was held, and the officer fails to stop Ramsey from leaving. Brockman chases after her on foot - he contends she tried to run him over - and the car ends up only 20 seconds later in a ditch. The position of the deputy when he fired the shots is not shown, nor are the actual gun shots. There is no audio in the video. Off camera: The shooting was not shown in the footage - the smoke is coming from the car after it crashed into a ditch . Shell-shocked: The passenger on the left side of the screen stumbled out of the car and collapsed onto the ground in tears, the driver of the car on the right threw his arms in the air just after the shots were fired . Devastated: Another person collapses into the street on the right side of the screen and rocks back and forth uncontrollably . The crash is also off the screen, but a . cloud of smoke soon billows up from the car and a passenger stumbles out . and collapses onto the road. She can be seen crying at the side of the road before another person is seen overcome with emotion. Both throw their arms in the air multiple times, the person on the right side of the screen rocks back and forth, unable to calm down. Ambulances and other police officers soon arrive and begin questioning the other teens that either saw the incident or were at the party. Ramsey is already dead. An Ambulance soon leaves, presumably with her body. Brockman suffered only a leg injury and was placed on administrative leave while the incident is investigated, sources told WLWT. Final ride: Ramsey's body was taken away in this ambulance . Tragic death: Deputy Tyler Brockman (left) says he shot dead Samantha Ramsey (right) in self defense, but family and friends disagree - he has been placed on leave while the incident is investigated . Shot up: The four bullet holes in the windshield are clearly visible . ‘She lost her life for him jumping on the hood of a young girl’s car,’ friend Gunnar Buemi told the station during a vigil. Buemi became more enraged as the day went on. ‘That's murder!’ He shouted while frantically waving his arms as people cheered him on. ‘Justice needs to be done about this injustice. We're all sitting here lighting candles, being quiet when the government is out here shooting. ‘Any other human would have been put in jail for that. He needs to answer for what he did to that family.’ He was not alone in his outrage. Grieving: Mother Brandi Stewart attended the candlelight vigil and said she wants answers . Write caption here . Outraged: Friend Gunnar Buemi shouted that Ramsey was murdered and called for the cop to be jailed . ‘Just to be shot four times that's excessive,’ friend Lynsy Hall told WXIX. ‘That wasn't right. He could have killed the other three people that were in the car’ One of the girls in the car said the officer used excessive force. ‘The cop was in the wrong,’ Chelsea Pendleton told the Cincinnati Enquirer. ‘I was there. I was in the back seat. That was unnecessary force. He had no right to do that.’ ‘That was dead body weight on the gas pedal after she was shot,’ she added. A large crowd including the slain teen’s mother gathered to light candles on the side of the road. She isn’t angry, but she does want to know what happened. Sad day: The memorial left at the scene of Ramsey's death . ‘I just want to know what happened. I want answers,’ Brandi Stewart lamented to WXIX. ‘He was the last person that looked in my daughter's eyes that saw her face and I want answers.’ The gathering was large enough to close the road, and it brought back memories for one of the passengers in Ramsay’s car when all hell broke loose. ‘After the shots, I ducked down and then we're reversing back into the ditch and we couldn't get out for a second and I opened the door and dropped to my knees and started bawling my eyes out,’ Chelsea Pendleton told WLWT. Authorities have not commented on the shooting other than to say an investigation is ongoing.Her friends and mother are trying to remember her in a better light. It is not yet known if Ramsey had been drinking or doing drugs prior to the incident, police are awaiting toxicology results for confirmation. ‘I wouldn't have expected anything less because she was so loved, you know, she's a good person,’ Stewart added. ‘She loved people, they loved her. She was a people person.’","Samantha Ramsey, 19, was shot four times by a sheriff's deputy as she left a party early Saturday morning .

"Terrorists in Nairobi gave a live commentary on Twitter as they murdered dozens of innocents at Westgate shopping centre. Members of Al Shabaab gloated as the death toll rose and mocked the Kenyan government forces trying to save hostages. In a startling new turn in terrorist tactics, they left US-based Twitter flat-footed as the website tried to shut down the terrorist accounts, only for others to spring up within minutes. Scroll down for video . Response: A police officer tries to secure an area inside the Westgate Shopping Centre where gunmen went on a shooting spree in Nairobi, Kenya . Internet experts said that the tweets show how terrorists are adapting to modern technology to spread fear as far and as quickly as possible. And they belie the image of the Somalia-based Islamist group as primitive militia holed up in the desert. The group used the hashtag Westgate to attract as many readers as possible to their hate-filled propaganda. They wrote: ‘Westgate a 14-hour standoff relayed in 1,400 rounds of bullets and 140 characters of vengeance and still ongoing. Good morning Kenya!’ The extremist cell even began to name the so-called ‘Westgate warriors’ behind the carnage. Gloats: Members of Al Shabaab gloated as the death toll rose and mocked the Kenyan government forces trying to save hostages . As the violence entered a second night yesterday, the siege played out over Twitter as the group posted the names of their gunmen, claiming they came from London, the US, Finland and Somalia. They compared Kenyan troops to ‘rabbits caught in the headlights’ and said an attempt to storm the building ‘failed miserably’. ‘The . Kenyan government is pleading with our Mujahideen inside the mall for . negotiations. There will be no negotiations whatsoever,’ they wrote. British Twitter consultant Mark Shaw said the ‘extraordinary’ messages give Al Shabaab a ‘global voice, instantly’. He added: ‘This is the world we live in now. It is instant, it is in real time and people with the smallest amount of technology can do it. ‘All it takes is a mobile phone and access to the internet. They know that they can get their words out far and wide with very little effort.’ A supporter who spoke to the militants, known as Mujahideen (Muslim guerrilla warriors) by mobile tweeted on Saturday that non-Muslims were being targeted. He referred to non-believers using the derogatory term ‘kuffar’. ‘Only kuffar were singled out for this attack,’ he wrote. ‘All Muslims inside Westgate were escorted out by the Mujahideen before beginning the attack.’ As the siege continued, the account was suspended, only for another to spring up with a similar name. It revealed: ‘The Mujahideen are still firmly in control of the situation inside Westgate mall. Negotiation is out of the question!’ Al Shabaab has been active on Twitter for years and uses its account to draw attention to its warped cause. It taunts its enemies and posts messages countering mainstream views of its attacks and ongoing fighting in Somalia. English-speaking members have posted inflammatory messages, often referring to events in the West. A few months ago its members even emailed journalists with a new account after it was suspended for breaching Twitter guidelines, which ban threats of violence. It urged reporters to follow a new account: ‘Follow us for the Mujahideen’s take on events in Somalia as well as events in the global context.’ The threat of an attack by multiple gunmen on a location packed with civilians remains one of the biggest fears of British counter terrorism chiefs. Senior police officers remain convinced that the ambition of violent Islamists to stage a Mumbai-style atrocity is undiminished. Deaths: The 2008 Mumbai outrage stunned the world with 12 co-ordinated attacks by Islamic-extremist terrorists. Pictured is gunman Ajmal Kasab . They have spent millions of pounds bolstering security at the highest profile targets, training marksmen and investing in the best equipment. But privately many will admit that if determined terrorists manage to obtain automatic weapons the result will be catastrophic. Officials fear dozens could be killed within minutes before armed police could arrive. ‘There has to be an understanding that in the first hour there will be a lot of challenges, a lot of dead people,’ one senior officer said. The 2008 Mumbai outrage stunned the world as 12 co-ordinated attacks by Islamic-extremist terrorists on hotels, community centres and streets in India’s largest city left 173 people dead. Two years later, the threat of a copycat attack on British soil was deemed so severe that the US warned its citizens they were in danger if they travelled here. Intelligence officials said Al Qaeda-inspired fanatics planned to open fire on crowds at busy sites in London, Paris and Berlin. The information came from German Al Qaeda member Ahmed Sidiqi, who was under interrogation and said Osama bin Laden personally ordered the attacks. Areas said to be at risk were tourist destinations, hotels, public transport hubs and shopping centres. Two former SAS commanders have warned that if terrorists did strike, the country would face a ‘slow motion’ September 11. In 2010, Lieutenant General Sir Graeme Lamb and Colonel Richard Williams said a Mumbai-type plot would ‘outmatch’ the police and turn London into a war zone, with innocents being ‘murdered one by one, floor by floor’ if terrorists got inside a target such as Canary Wharf.","Al Shabaab members gloated as death toll from Nairobi massacre rose .

"A self-taught photographer has scooped a coveted award after taking stunning images of some of the most beautiful places on earth with the world's most expensive digital camera. John Chapple has been awarded the Hasselblad Owners Club Photographer of The Month for July for his mesmerising image of the Colorado River  meandering around Horseshoe Bend, near Page, Arizona. It was taken on a Hasselblad H3D-50 - considered to be one of the best and one of the expensive cameras in the world. The basic camera price starts at £20,000 but can quickly soar higher once lens are added. The H3D-50 is a 50 megapixel camera - much, much higher than the standard eight megapixels found in the iPhone 5 camera and other digital recorders. Award-winning: This image of the Colorado River meandering around Horseshoe Bend, near Page, Arizona, has won John Chapple the coveted  Hasselblad Owners Club Photographer of The Month for July . Stone room with a view: The underside of the Meca Arch in Utah glows from the reflected sunlight off the sandstone cliff just below it in this image taken on a super-high resolution Hasselblad 50megapixel camera . The father-of-two, from Devon but now . living in Southern California, took the Hasselblad on . a road-trip through the west coast of the States to Canada and back . down through Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Arizona and Nevada. It was his beautiful images from the trip, which also includes one of a man dancing in a beam of light in Antelope Canyon, . that won him the prestigious prize. On his blog, he wrote: 'Hasselblad . were kind enough to allow me to test drive their H3D-50 in the summer of . 2010. I took a road trip up . 'I was really excited to get to Page, . Arizona, to photograph Horseshoe Bend and Antelope Canyon, and really . use the Hasselblad as it was intended. 'The canyons are on Navajo land, and . after a flash flood that killed 11 tourists in August of 1997, visitors . are only permitted to enter the canyon with a Navajo guide. 'I joined a guided tour group, and we . were shown the best spots to photograph. When we got to the place I’d . wanted to photograph in Antelope Canyon, I got caught up in what I was . doing, and didn’t notice that the group had moved on. Trick of the light: John captured this image of a man dancing in a shaft of light within Antelope Canyon in Arizona with the Hasselblad 50 megapixel camera while on his road-trip across America . Quality shot: The Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, can be seen in startling detail in this image taken on the Hasselbald H3D-50 .

The Hasselblad H3D-50 - one of the best digital and most expensive cameras in the world, pictured left, and the Linhof Technorama 617, pictured right, which takes 6cm x17cm negatives - meaning that it can only take four pictures per film roll . 'While I was waiting for a shaft of . direct sunlight to filter into the canyon, the guide came back to get me . to keep me with the group. I knew I only had seconds to capture the . much-anticipated shot. 'There was dust in the air that was . illuminated by the shaft of light, looking incredible. During the long . exposure, another visitor decided to jump in front of my tripod mounted . camera and dance in the beam of light. 'I’m ashamed to admit at the time I . wanted to throttle him, and shared a few choice words with other . photographers there. But when I previewed the image on the back of the . camera, I knew I’d captured a magical shot and it was a 50 megapixel . file.' He has also used a panoramic Linhof Technorama 617 for much of his work, enabling him to take super-wide pictures that are so large the camera can only fit . four images on every film roll. The 6cm x 17cm photographs are much bigger and have a higher rendition than those taken by most digital cameras and can therefore be blown up to huge sizes without blurring. The end result is wide panoramic pictures that are far beyond the range of normal visualisation.

"At least three young Minnesota women are now believed to have traveled to Syria to give aid to the ISIS terror group responsible for the brutal beheadings of American journalists, MailOnline has learned. The trio left some three weeks ago, Omar Jamal, a leader of the Somali community in the state capital, St. Paul, tells MailOnline. They said they intended to become nurses tending to fighters injured in ISIS' violent surge in Syria and Iraq. The news comes as 19-year-old suburban Denver woman Shannon Conley who federal authorities say intended to wage jihad has pleaded guilty to trying to help the Islamic State militant group in Syria. American girl: Colorado teen Shannon Conley pleaded guilty to terror charges in Denver federal court today after her April arrest for trying to flee the country and join ISIS . Searching: Conley (pictured on the right, with a friend) tried out several different religions in college before selecting Islam . Abroad, police fear two young girls who fled Austria are inspiring other teenagers to join Islamic State ranks after they successfully fled the country saying they were going to Syria. Samra Kesinovic was aged just 16 and her friend Sabina Selimovic 15 when the two vanished this year from their homes in the Austrian capital Vienna. The case of one of the Minnesota girls, a 19-year-old, has already been widely reported, after the girl's family called the FBI, but Jamal said he believes at least two more girls have gone to the Middle East hotspot. 'Their identity is not known because their families have not contacted the authorities,' said Jamal. 'They have gone to Syria but as there are no official reports of them we do not know who they are.' The shocking new revelation comes as MailOnline can reveal that the FBI has subpoenaed the 19-year-old girl's family to appear before a Grand Jury later this month, as authorities attempt to discover who bought her ticket, gave her money and provided her with a false passport. There is no suggestion that the family is under criminal investigation, said one law enforcement source with knowledge of the subpoena. 'They are looking for evidence on exactly what the family knows,' said the source. Included in the subpoena is a demand for cell phone records as the girl called her brother from Turkey and later, after she crossed the border, from Syria. Teen jihadis: Left is Samra Kesinovic, 16, who is thought to have fled to Syria to join the Islamic State from Austria. On the right is 15-year-old Sabina Selimovic who went with her . Austrian teens: Samra Kesinovic and Sabina Selimovic in a photo they posted online. Police now fear the two are inspiring other girls to flee to Syria to take up holy war . However, Jamal said the girl's family is worried about what may happen at the Grand Jury hearing and feels 'betrayed' by the FBI's action as it believed it had done the right thing by contacting authorities in the first place while the families of the two unidentified girls do not have to appear. FBI's Minnesota spokesman Kyle Loven told MailOnline he 'is not in a position to comment' on the subpoena because the case of the missing girl is an ongoing investigation. 'I cannot confirm and will not deny its existence,' he said. The teen, who turns 20 next month, was about to start nursing classes at St. Paul College but decided to leave to give aid to wounded fighters. Jamal said he is sure she will not be placed into front line battle but it is possible she would be married off to one of the ISIS fighters. She is the middle of five children brought up by a single Somali mother, living off St. Paul's Selby Avenue. She had recently started taking classes at al-Farook Youth and Family Center in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington, said Bob Fletcher, a former sheriff in St. Paul, who has dedicated himself to helping the Twin Cities' large Somali community since being defeated in an election in 2010. Al-Farook has been at the center of claims that Amir Meshal, an alleged recruiter for ISIS, had been talking to youngsters on its site. The mosque kicked the New Jersey-born man off campus, but now the Minneapolis-St. Paul Fox TV station has raised questions of whether Meshal is actually an FBI mole rather than an ISIS recruiter. Possible recruiting ground: Al-Farook has been at the center of claims that Amir Meshal, an alleged recruiter for ISIS, had been talking to youngsters on its site . 'What we don't know is whether al-Farook is part of the problem or part of the solution right now,' said Jamal. 'And who is Amir Meschal? Where did he come from? Did he recruit these girls?' Meshal sued the FBI in federal court in 2009 claiming he was tortured and held for four months in three different countries after being apprehended crossing the Somali border into Kenya. The young woman who is known to have gone to Syria traveled on a 'borrowed' passport. However the passport holder did not report it was missing until the girl had already entered Syria, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported. In the family's only comments, a male relative asked in the Star-Tribune: 'How many more kids have to die before we do something about it? 'Those animals who are taking our children are what we’re concerned about. We love this country more than anything else. I love America. We don’t want to see anything bad happen here. This is the most dangerous thing happening to this country.' ISIS has rocketed to infamy over the summer due to its savage rampage through Iraq and Syria where it has murdered thousands of civilians and soldiers. American journalists Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff were both beheaded in videos that the group distributed to the west. Despite the violent imagery, Fletcher, the retired sheriff, said recruitment to ISIS is appealing to young Muslims because they get the feeling they are in at the start of something new, an Islamic state, hat they believe can offer them a future they fail to see in America. 'Many Somalis are struggling as their transition to the American life has been difficult. They have been here a shorter time than most immigrants and their arrival coincided with a downturn in the economy so many have not been able to find work. 'Many also came here without fathers, who had either been killed in the war or did not make the trip, so on occasion the extremist religious leader becomes their father-figure.' He said that going to be a nurse in an ISIS stronghold like Raqqa in northern Syria is also attractive because it is portrayed as relatively stable away from the frontline battle and a place where volunteers can start to build the infrastructure of a new city.","Three girls left Minnesota three weeks ago to join ISIS insurgents in Syria .

"It took an adoption and a wedding for internet mogul Kim Dotcom to get his famous last name. One of the more surprising stories to come out of Dotcom's bail hearing at Auckland District Court on Thursday was how the internet entrepreneur got his surname. Born Kim Schmitz in West Germany, Dotcom changed his name to Kim Tim Jim Vestor when he applied for a Finnish passport to mirror his company which was called Kimvestor. The court heard how the internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom got his surname . While living in the Philippines, he heard about a man with the last name Dotcom, the internet entrepreneur told the court. He asked whether it would be possible for the man to adopt him so he could take on the last name Dotcom. The process was going to be difficult, so the man instead adopted the mogul's now-estranged wife Mona, who'd never been acknowledged by her birth father. It comes after his estranged wife Mona Dotcom filed a $20 million legal claim for cash and assets . Dotcom is the founder of Megaupload, which allowed users to download movies, music, e-books and TV shows . Kim and Mona wed, and Kim applied to take the name of his wife in 2005 at the Finnish Embassy in Hong Kong. 'I simply thought Kim Dotcom was the cooler name,' Dotcom told the court on Thursday. It comes after his estranged wife filed a $20 million legal claim for cash and assets including luxury cars and millions of dollars seized in an armed raid on their New Zealand mansion they once shared. Dotcom is accused of $175 million copyright theft from pirated copies of movies, music, e-books and TV shows and is the founder of Megaupload, which allowed users to download the material.

"Christian mother Meriam Ibrahim was pictured cradling her baby girl in the back seat of a car on Thursday night moments after she was freed by the Sudanese police. Dr Ibrahim had been arrested at Khartoum airport on Tuesday as she and her American husband Daniel Wani tried to leave the country. The mother-of-two, who had been facing a death sentence for converting to Christianity, was accused of trying to use forged travel documents when she presented airport staff with emergency paperwork issued by the U.S. embassy and South Sudan. Scroll down for video . Road to freedom: Meriam Ibrahim holds her baby girl close as she is driven away from the police station in Khartoum . Free: Meriam poses hours after her release on MOnday with her husband, Daniel (left) and her children, Martin (on Daniel's knee) and baby Maya and all those who bravely fought for her freedom in Sudan . The 27-year-old doctor is expected to fly to South Sudan with her husband and two young children, before making her way to the U.S. to start a new life. She has endured nine months of imprisonment after being jailed for adultery and . apostasy, for which she was sentenced to death and 100 lashes. Dr Ibrahim, who gave birth to her daughter while shackled to a prison floor last month, had finally been freed from the death sentence on Monday but her hopes of escape were quickly cut short. When she arrived at the airport she was taken back into custody, causing concern for her family and human rights campaigners who had fought for her release. Her lawyer, Eman Abdul-Rahman, said she was freed on Thursday after pressure from foreign diplomats moved the government to release her. Campaigners however have urged caution and said that they will wait until Meriam actually gets out of Sudan before celebrating. The US State Department is now under pressure to do everything in its power to ensure her swift and safe passage after being criticized by Senators for its response. Dr Ibrahim’s release appeared chaotic as the Associated Press initially said she had been freed, only for multiple media outlets and MailOnline sources to say that she was in fact being kept in for another three days. Secrets: The family were seized by the National . Intelligence Security Services, dubbed the 'Agents of Fear' by Amnesty . International, which accused them of a catalogue of abuses . Hours later it was revealed that she was being freed. The Guardian . said that Eman Abdul-Rahman, one of her lawyers, said she had been . released from a police station in the capital Khartoum after pressure . from foreign diplomats on the Sudanese government to free her. Also . in custody with her in the police station cell in the Sudanese capital . Khartoum was her husband and their two . children, Maya, one month, and Martin, 21 months. Dr Ibrahim was charged with obtaining a false travel document and . giving false information to immigration officials - and banned from . leaving Sudan. The move was another twist of the knife as she tried to get to America with her two children where she can live with her husband, a US citizen, from Manchester, New Hampshire. Menacing: . Meriam, her husband and children were detained by 40 National Security . guards on Tuesday . Mr Wani was also locked up with them . as an 'accessory' at the Al Sheradee police station in Khartoum after . being confronted at Khartoum airport by 40 agents of the feared National . Intelligence and Security Services. It . is believed they were trying to travel to Washington DC and Sudanese . media have claimed that the US vice consul was with the family at the . airport. A diplomatic row . erupted at the escape from Sudan and the Sudanese Foreign Ministry . summoned the American and South Sudanese ambassadors to explain . themselves. Dr Ibrahim had been granted emergency travel documents by the government of South Sudan to travel there and then on to the US. Mr Shareif insisted that the documents were legitimate and that it was ‘not right’ to claim otherwise. Dr Ibrahim was released from the grim Omdurman Women’s Prison on Monday after nine months in custody. A judge had ruled that she had broken strict Islamic law by failing to renounce her Christian faith and become a Muslim. 'Barbaric': As well as the death sentence for apostasy (the crime of abandoning your religion) Ibrahim was also sentenced to 100 lashes for what the court deemed her adultery for marrying a Christian . On Monday an appeal court overturned . her conviction after an international outcry but on Tuesday she and her . family were detained again. They had been staying at a safe house because of threats to her life from her 'family'. A . man claiming to be Dr Ibrahim’s half brother went to the prison in . Khartoum the night she was released and, upon discovering she had been . freed, flew into a rage and vowed to kill her. According to CNN, al-Samani al-Hadi, said: ‘The family is unconvinced by the court’s decision. ‘We . were not informed by the court that she was to be released; this came . as a surprise to us. The law has failed to uphold our rights. This is . now an issue of honour. The Christians have tarnished our honour, and we . will know how to avenge it.’ Speaking . to Sudanese paper, al-Samani al-Hadi, said that Dr Ibrahim had been . 'kidnapped' from the family who she should have been returned to, not . her husband. Fight for life: Mr Wani, an American citizen, has been fighting for his wife and children's release but his lawyers believe the help he has received from the US embassy has been 'shameful' State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in her Tuesday briefing that the Sudanese government had assured it of the safety of Dr Ibrahim and her family. She said the department was talking to Sudanese officials to ‘secure their safe and swift departure from Sudan’.","Meriam Ibrahim and her husband, US citizen Daniel Wani, were held as they tried to fly out of the country on Tuesday .

"Queens Park Rangers will almost certainly have to significantly increase their January transfer window wage structure to land primary target Jermain Defoe. Sportsmail understands the Loftus Road are prepared to offer between £25-30,000 weekly wage to prospective new signings this month. The club are only in the market for loan moves or free transfers this window as they look to cut their cloth accordingly. QPR are interested in signing Toronto FC striker Jermain Defoe on loan until the end of the season . Defoe's (left) basic wage of £60,000-a-week is proving a problem to QPR who face FFP regulations . The Hoops are prepared to offer between £25-30,000-a-week in wages to prospective new signings this month . Furthermore, QPR are also hugely reluctant to fork out loan fees for new signings. The restrictions place major doubt over Rangers' proposed move for Defoe. Redknapp has openly admitted his desire to reunite himself with Defoe, who he has worked with at West Ham, Portsmouth and Tottenham, this month. But Toronto FC would rather sell than loan the ex-England star, while they are also keen to recoup as much of £6million they spent on the striker last January. Likewise, even if they did agree to a loan, Defoe's basic wage of £60,000-per-week means Rangers may require Toronto to fork out a percentage of the forward's wages. The financial constraints set on the club are an attempt to ensure Rangers comply with Financial Fair Play regulations. The club already have a breach of Football League FFP rules hanging over them.

"For many Britons, escaping the trials and tribulations of a hectic family/work lifestyle is a perfect excuse to book a sunshine getaway abroad. But there are some things that they can't go without - and shockingly fast food is one of those. It seems half of British holidaymakers leave their hunger for adventure at the door when it comes to dining abroad. Brits go for fast food on foreign holidays as it is cheaper and they have fears over how clean restaurants are . A survey of 2,000 people by Hotels.com has revealed that 50 per cent of Brits admit to choosing well-known fast food restaurants over local eateries when on holiday. Lizann Peppard of the Hotels.com brand said: 'It's a shame to think that thousands of Brits travelling across the world will be choosing standardised fast food instead of indulging in international delicacies such as Italian osso buco or Singaporean chilli crab. 'Cuisine is a major part of all cultures and enjoying local food is a wonderful way to make the most of a trip away from home.' While almost a third (30 per cent) of Brits choose fast food on holiday because it's the most cost effective option, one in ten (10 per cent) admit they believe that fast food is tastier than foreign fare. A fifth of people surveyed admitted to going for fast food as they don't understand other menus . A fifth (20 per cent) of Brits say they actually choose fast food because they don't understand menus in local establishments, showing that alongside cuisine, language is not really a high priority for many Britons travelling overseas. Furthermore, nine per cent of British travellers confess to being delicate diners, as they simply don't trust local eateries to be clean enough. Even in familiar restaurants abroad tourists admit to being picky with a staggering 85 per cent revealing they don't even like trying unfamiliar international additions to chain-restaurant menus, completely ruling out the chance for any foreign foodie forays.","Stats reveal chain restaurants and fast food outlets popular with Brits .

"A Syrian helicopter pilot who was shot down by the Turkish military was beheaded by rebels, it was claimed today. Horrific footage which purports to show a man's headless corpse dressed in military-style helicopter flight suit and dumped in a ditch has been circulating online since last night, just a few hours after the aircraft crashed. The film also zooms in on a bloody head lying a few yards from the corpse. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Shocking footage apparently shows a Syrian helicopter pilot beheaded by rebels after he was shot down by Turkish forces . The film shows a bloody head lying a few yards from the corpse . The footage shows one a group of men surrounding the body search through the man's clothes . It has been impossible to establish . if the disturbing images do indeed show the chopper pilot or if it is rebel propaganda. According to website Weasel Zippers, . the pilot was beheaded by Syrian rebels after the helicopter was shot . down by Turkish warplanes. The video, which has been released on LiveLeak, shows one of the men searching through the pilot's pockets. It is believed that the man's head was probably removed after his death. A further two amateur videos have also . emerged which apparently show Syrian rebels shooting at the pilot as he parachutes from his stricken craft. It . is unclear which side of the border the pilot and the helicopter landed . on, but the videos of the shootings are said to have been shot in . Lattakia, in the Al-Akrad mountains, in Syria. It is believed that the man's head was probably removed after his death . The videos are the latest in a series of disturbing images to have emerged from the Syrian crisis which show the brutality from both sides. Last week, MailOnline reported on a . public execution that took place on August 31 in the town of Keferghan . in the north of the country. The whole barbaric episode is watched by a crowd of jeering men, many of them armed. Sitting on a low wall only a few feet from where the wretched captive died so violently is a line of young boys. They . were still there as the dead man’s head was dumped on his body. Another . child, even younger, was led by the hand past the corpse. The . picture forms part of a set taken by a photojournalist - whose identity . has not been revealed in order to protect him - who was given . unprecedented access to the gruesome proceedings. Amateur video footage, said to have been taken in Lattakia, in Syria, apparently shows the helicopter falling from the sky and exploding when it hits the ground . The helicopter can apparently be seen falling from the sky in a ball of flames after it was shot down . Among the other photos are an . executioner lining up his sword before delivering the final blow as his . victim kneels in the village square - and a victim's head being held . aloft by a jubilant fighter. Although . it is difficult to confirm the political affiliation of those involved, . an eyewitness told Time that the executioners belonged to ISIS - an . Al-Qaeda faction opposed to President Bashar Assad's regime. The . captives, meanwhile, are understood to belong to the fearsome Shabiha . ('ghosts') - thugs loyal to Assad who are said to roam the country . massacring women and children. Human Rights Watch yesterday, meanwhile, released details of a massacre, possibly one of the deadliest since the start of the conflict in Syria. The organisation claimed Syrian forces brutally slaughtered 248 people in the coastal towns of al-Bayda and Baniyas in May. The chilling accounts are detailed in the 68-page report, 'No One’s Left’: Summary Executions by Syrian Forces in al-Bayda and Baniyas' and are based on interviews with 15 al-Bayda residents and 5 from Baniyas. Syria's army acknowledged the helicopter had strayed into Turkish airspace for a short time while monitoring 'terrorists' moving across the border into Syria . And in May a video that appeared to . show a Syrian rebel cutting out and eating the heart of a dead . government soldier was posted online in an horrific propaganda stunt. Turkey has confirmed it shot down a Syrian helicopter yesterday after it crossed into Turkish airspace. The government has warned it had taken all necessary measures to defend itself against any further violations. Turkey . said it scrambled two F-16 jets along the border between its southern . Hatay province and Syria after warning the Mi-17 helicopter it was . approaching Turkish airspace shortly before 2.30pm, the military said in . a statement. Turkey has confirmed it shot down a Syrian helicopter yesterday after it crossed into Turkish airspace . Syria called the reaction 'hasty' and accused Turkey of trying to escalate tensions along the border. A . voice on the video of rebels shooting at the pilot as he parachutes . from the helicopter is heard saying: 'Allahu Akbar... Allahu Akbar... Ahfad ar-Rasoul in the cost, downing an aircraft, downing an aircraft... Allahu Akbar.' As people inspected the wreckage, a voice over the video can be heard heard saying: 'Here are Bashar al-Assad aircrafts.' News agency Reuters has said it cannot . independently verify the authenticity of the videos which were uploaded . on a social media website. 'Turkey will definitely not allow any . violation of its borders ... We will defend our borders and our people's . security to the end' - Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu . The video shows the helicopter falling from the sky in a ball of flames and exploding when it hits the ground. Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc said a warplane shot down the helicopter after it ventured up to a mile into Turkey near the border town of Yayladagi. 'It was repeatedly warned by our air defence elements,' he said. 'Turkey will definitely not allow any violation of its borders ... We will defend our borders and our people's security to the end,' Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told reporters in Paris. 'No one will have the nerve to violate Turkey's borders in any way again,' he said after a meeting to discuss Syria with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, British Foreign Secretary William Hague and their French counterpart Laurent Fabius. Davutoglu said details of the incident would be provided to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the U.N. Security Council and fellow members of the NATO military alliance.

The Syrian military said the helicopter strayed into Turkish airspace by accident and that the aircraft was on its way back when it was shot down . The Syrian military said it was an accident and that the aircraft was on its way back when it was shot down. In a statement carried by state news agency SANA, it accused Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's government of trying to increase tensions between the two countries. 'The hasty response from the Turkish side, especially as the aircraft was on its way back and was not charged with any combat missions, is proof of the true intentions of Erdogan's government toward Syria to increase tensions and escalate the situation on the border between the two countries,' it said. Turkey, one of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's fiercest critics, has advocated military intervention in Syria' It shares a 560 mile border with Syria and is sheltering a quarter of the 2 million people who have fled the Syrian conflict.","Footage apparently shows helicopter pilot shot down by Turkish forces .

Victor Marshall Nash, 18, is charged with attempted first degree murder, sexual battery, robbery and grand theft for the alleged attack on his teacher at South Dade Senior High School on Friday. Detectives say two hours after the last class ended, Nash approached the teacher and put his arm around her. When she told him 'No, stop,' he body-slammed her to the ground and smashed her head against the floor. Scroll down for video . Shocking charges: Victor Marshall Nash, 18, is accused of brutally raping his teacher at South Dade High School after class on Friday after choking her until she passed out . The 6-foot-1, 200lb teen then choked the teacher until she passed out. While she was unconscious, he raped her and left the used condom in her purse, police say. The teen then threw his victim's cell phone in the garbage and stole her car keys. When the teacher came to, Nash was gone. Nash is 6-foot-1 and weighs more than 200lbs, authorities say . Police found him five hours later driving the teacher's car nearby. Officers say Nash confessed to the crimes. The teachers union confirmed that Nash had attacked at teacher and said in a statement: 'We are shocked and dismayed by the event reported at South Dade Senior High. 'Our schools should be a place of safety and serenity, not only for students, but the adults who work there as well.' Nash's father, Victor Marshall Nash Sr., is a convicted sex offender who has also been arrested in the past on child abuse charges. He told WVSN-TV that he was 'shocked' to hear his son had been arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a teacher. 'When me and his mother were together, we tried to raise him, I guess you can say, as both loving parents,' the elder Mr Nash said. He said he doesn't think his son knows about his father's arrest.

Lille have played down the prospects of Divock Origi joining Liverpool early from his season-long loan. Liverpool need a striker and have clubs showing interest in Fabio Borini and Rickie Lambert but Origi has scored just four goals this season and is struggling to find the form that earned him a starting place for Belgium at the World Cup. Being thrust into the spotlight at Anfield where the pressure is greater is not seen as the wisest move. VIDEO Scroll down to see Divock Origi's  penalty miss for Lille against Wolfsburg . Divock Origi is unlikely to join Liverpool in this transfer window according to Lille . The player is keen to join but much may hinge on how Daniel Sturridge looks on his return to Melwood this week and how his thigh holds up to training and games. Lille director Jean-Michel Vandamme said: 'Origi to Liverpool now? It would cost at least £4.7m but at the moment it is not possible.' That Origi hasn't scored in 13 matches might offer some insight into how desperate Liverpool would have to be to pay the fee.

"A fugitive bodybuilder charged with assaulting a teenage girl he met on Instagram while on the run from police over a separate offence has been cleared of rape. Lloyd Seddon was accused of attacking the 16-year-old after meeting her on the photosharing website in February, five months after vanishing while on parole for robbery. The 23-year-old from Salford, Manchester, was found not guilty of raping the girl at his home at Manchester Crown Court today. Lloyd Seddon was cleared of raping a 16-year-old girl after being hunted by police for more than six months . Police had been unable to find the man after he failed to show up for a court hearing in November following early release from a five-year prison sentence for armed robbery. In April Greater Manchester Police released photographs of the criminal after a teenage girl reported she had been raped by him. He was arrested at a flat in Shrewsbury in May and charged with the sexual assault. During his trial the court heard how Seddon exchanged messages with the teenage girl on Instagram before meeting up for their 'first date'. They met for cocktails on February 19 and took a taxi back to an address in Irwell where she alleged he pulled her hair and 'bit and slapped' her. She said she was saved after phoning a friend during the attack, a claim which was dismissed by Seddon's defence lawyers. The 23-year-old from Salford, Manchester, said the girl may have become scared of him when he showed a 'different side' after she changed her mind about having sex with him . Seddon was wanted by police after failing to appear at court following early release from a five-year jail sentence for armed robbery . Police issued an appeal for the man's whereabouts after the girl reported being raped in April. They urged members of the public to look out for Seddon who has a distinctive tattoo on his right forearm . Today, barrister Michael Johnson told how the girl had in fact become 'embarrassed' by the encounter so falsely accused him of assaulting her. In response she retracted her accusation of rape, telling the court: 'No I didn't say I was raped, I explained to police what happened and said what is it classed as and they said that comes down as rape. 'I never said I was raped.' Giving evidence Seddon said the sex had been consensual but when the girl changed her mind he stopped immediately but became verbally abusive. 'She probably just seen another side of me and she got scared. 'She’s a young girl. I shouldn't have taken her back to mine, I should never have taken her out in the first place,' he said. In just half-an-hour he was unanimously cleared of the charge by a jury. Seddon was unanimously cleared of rape following a trial at Manchester Crown Court (pictured) today . Speaking after his conviction, the 23-year-old's family said: 'This unanimous decision is a triumph for British justice. It’s been terrible for the family. 'We all knew he was not guilty.' Earlier relatives complained at the way Seddon had been portrayed by police in their appeal to trace him. Speaking in April, his mother Cresta Dickinson pleaded for him to come forward to clear his name. 'He has been called every name under the sun and it isn’t right. He is just a gym user and would go maybe a couple of times a week. 'He likes to look after himself but he is definitely not a cage fighter.' A Greater Manchester Police appeal warned members of the public not to approach him. 'Lloyd Seddon has a history of violence and is not to be approached. 'However, Seddon is a fitness fanatic who takes part in cage-fighting and mixed martial arts and officers believe he will be unable to resist the temptation to visit the gym.'","Lloyd Seddon was accused of raping a 16-year-old girl in February .

"Poor timekeeping has been one of the issues surrounding West Brom’s troublesome striker Saido Berahino, who did not celebrate any of his four goals in the 7-0 FA Cup win over Gateshead. Berahino has reported late for match days three times this season, the latest being the Manchester City game on Boxing Day for which he has already paid his fine. The Burundi-born forward, who earned his first England squad call-up for the Slovenia and Scotland matches but played no part, was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving at high speed last October, after which West Brom postponed any talk of a new contract. And Berahino’s form had rapidly declined until last Saturday. New manager Tony Pulis is expected to try to revitalise Berahino, 21, rather than sell him this month despite interest from Liverpool.

Non-League side Blyth Spartans are complaining to the FA about their £6,750 fee for Match of the Day highlights coverage of their third-round Cup match against Birmingham. The Beeb had seven cameras at Croft Park, meaning Blyth had to take out seats and standing areas that would have brought in £6,000 worth of ticket sales. And the TV requirements also restricted entry to the club shop. An FA spokesman said: ‘The fee is really just to compensate costs.’ Non-League side Blyth Spartans are unhappy with the BBC regarding their Match of the Day fee . Barrow’s big bash . The most unlikely football kit launch of 2015 took place on New Year’s Day on the top floor of London’s Gherkin skyscraper. The glitzy venue wasn’t hosting a Barclays Premier League event, but the unveiling of Vanarama Conference North side Barrow’s strip for next season supplied by British company PlayerLayer. The lavish party was a statement about the grand ambitions of Barrow-born owner Paul Casson, a Dallas-based telecoms millionaire. Family man Casson, who had most of his many relatives from the North West at the champagne reception, is confident enough about taking his club — lying second in the table — up through the tiers of English football to have started making a film about the journey. Sky Sports News’ significant efforts to promote women in sport continue to be undermined by their own staff on social media. The latest post that would have infuriated the Isleworth high command was reporter Andy Burton retweeting American poker player Dan Blizerian’s comment: ‘Woke up with this in my bed’ next to a photograph of a scantily clad woman.

"A popular Israeli tourist resort was hit by a rocket attack this morning. The Red Sea destination of Eilat, hosting the European Triathlon Championships later this month, was already on high alert because of the upcoming Jewish Passover holiday starting this weekend. No-one was hurt in the attack, with police believing the missile was launched by Islamic militants from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. Remnants: The Red Sea destination of Eilat was already on high alert because of the upcoming Passover holiday which starts on Saturday . Many overseas tourists are already in the area, and it is due to welcome more than 4,000 athletes for the gruelling cycle-swim-run event which starts on April 19. No-one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, in an area which has general escaped terrorist attacks in recent year. But Israel has been warning of growing . lawlessness in Sinai following the uprising last year that overthrew . the Egyptian regime of Hosni Mubarak. Israeli officials say weak policing . and difficult terrain may be turning the peninsula into the latest focus . of Islamic militant activity in the region. 'We . are seeing now with Eilat that the Sinai Peninsula is turning into a . terror zone,' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in response . to the attack. He added: 'We cannot grant immunity to terror, we must fight against it.' Launched: No-one was hurt in the attack, with police believing the missile was launched by Islamic militants from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula . Careful work: Israeli policemen inspect the rocket which landed in the Red Sea resort of Eilat this morning . Egyptian . security forces and military aircraft were searching southeastern Sinai . for militants believed to be behind the launch, Egyptian security . officials said. Last . year, gunmen from the Sinai infiltrated into Israel and ambushed . vehicles on a desert highway, killing eight Israelis in a brazen, . co-ordinated attack. Israel . accused Palestinian militants from Gaza of crossing westward into Sinai, . making their way along the Israel-Egypt border and crossing back . eastward into Israel to carry out the attack. Israel is currently building an electronic barrier along its 150mile frontier with Egypt. Designed to halt the entry of both militants and illegal migrants, it is expected to be completed by the end of the year. But the fence 'does not stop rockets' and so Israel is also working on a solution to tackle the problem of incoming missiles. It could see an extension of Israel's Iron Dome, a mobile short-range rocket interceptor system which currently protects the nation from rocket fire from the Gaza Strip. Israel has so far deployed three of the systems, which helped fend off Palestinian rocket salvoes during a flare-up in fighting around the area last month. It uses small radar-guided missiles to blow up Katyusha-style rockets with ranges of between 3miles and 45miles, as well as mortar bombs, in mid-air. That . incident suggested Egypt's political upheaval and the resulting . power vacuum allowed Gaza militants with allies in Sinai to open a new . front against Israel on its long-quiet frontier with Egypt. Rockets . are regularly fired into Israel by Palestinian militants in the Gaza . Strip, but launches from Egyptian territory are rare. Today's attack appeared to be the first cross-border rocket attack from Egypt since the fall of the Mubarak regime last year. Rockets last hit Eilat and the nearby Jordanian town of Aqaba in 2010, killing one person and injuring four. In . a bid to halt the entry of both militants and illegal migrants, Israel . has stepped up surveillance on the Egyptian border and is building an . electronic barrier along the 150mile frontier. It is expected to be . completed by the end of the year. Netanyahu acknowledged the fence 'does not stop rockets', but that 'a solution will be found' to rockets from Egypt. Israel has been battling rocket fire from Gaza with a short-range rocket interceptor, the Iron Dome. It was not immediately clear if there were plans to position a mechanism near the Egyptian border. Most . militant attacks in Sinai are directed against Egyptian government . targets, including police facilities and a natural gas pipeline that . supplies Israel and Jordan. Islamic . radicals who fled Egyptian prisons during the chaos surrounding last . year's revolution sought asylum in Sinai, hooking up with disgruntled . tribes and militant groups that already had built strongholds there. Attack: The rocket was reportedly fired from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, and landed in the popular Israeli tourist resort of Eilat . Egypt . became the first Arab nation to sign a peace treaty with Israel in . 1979, but with the rise of Islamist parties who traditionally view . Israel with hostility, Israel has become concerned that the accord may . be under threat. The Muslim Brotherhood, the largest party in Egypt's parliament, does not openly oppose the peace deal with Israel. But . it has said it would consider amending the pact to allow more Egyptian . troops along the border with Israel. The deployment of Egyptian forces . in the Sinai is limited under the 1979 deal. Eilat's mayor Meir Yitzhak-Halevy said today the resort would carry on as normal. With its year-round sunshine, it has long been a favourite destination for UK visitors, particularly during UK winters. And . Eilat's attraction as a tourist centre could soon be further enhanced. An unidentified individual has offered to buy around 5,500 Titanic . artefacts and display them in the town. They include maps of the disaster area, photos of the wreck on the bottom of the ocean, and 1,000 hours of video footage. It documents the seven diving expeditions held at the site since 1987. The Jewish Passover holiday, which commemorates the exodus of the biblical Israelites from slavery in Egypt, starts tomorrow night and last for one week.

"Many people have claimed that reading a special book has transformed their life, but now scientists have discovered that enjoying a novel can make a real, measurable change in the brain too. U.S. researchers used fMRI scanners to identify brain networks associated with reading stories and found that changes in the brain linger for a few days after reading a powerful work of fiction. They set out to unravel the mystery of how stories ‘get into’ the brain and find the lingering effects of literature. Scientists from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, said reading a novel can cause changes in the 'resting-state connectivity' of the brain, which can last for days. They set out to unravel the mystery of how stories 'get into' the brain and find the lingering effects of literature . Scientists from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, said reading a novel can cause changes in the ‘resting-state’ of the brain, which can last for days. ‘Stories shape our lives and in some cases help define a person,’ said Gregory Berns, lead author of the study and director of the university’s Centre for Neuropolicy. ‘We want to understand how stories get into your brain and what they do to it,’ he said. The study, published in the journal Brain . Connectivity, was based on research using functional . magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at the brain networks involved . with the reading of stories. A total of 12 students participated in the experiment and read nine sections of Robert Harris' novel, Pompeii . A total of 12 students participated in the experiment, which was conducted over 19 consecutive days and saw them reading the same novel – Pompeii, a thriller by Robert Harris, which is based on the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in ancient Italy. The novel was selected for its page-turning narrative, which centres on the protagonist outside Pompeii, who sees signs of the eruption and struggles to get back to the city to save the woman he loves. Professor Berns said: ‘It was important to us that the book had a strong narrative line.’ While most previous studies have focused on the cognitive processes involved while people are reading stories in an fMRI scanner, this study was primarily concerned with the after effects of reading. Students’ brains were scanned in a resting state each morning for the first five days of the experiment. They were then given nine sections of the book over nine days and asked to read each 30 page section every evening. They then came into the lab the next morning to undergo an fMRI scan in a non-reading state - after answering a quiz to ensure they really had read the section. After completing all nine sections of the novel, the participants were scanned over five more mornings in a resting state. The results showed heightened connectivity in the left temporal cortex - an area of the brain which is associated with receptivity for language - on the mornings following the reading assignments. ‘Even though the participants were not actually reading the novel while they were in the scanner, they retained this heightened connectivity,’ Professor Berns said. ‘We call that a “shadow activity,” almost like a muscle memory,’ he added. Heightened connectivity was also seen in the central sulcus, which is the primary sensory motor region of the brain. The scientists used an fMRI scans (similar to those pictured) to find that neural changes created by reading the novel were associated with physical sensation and movement systems - suggesting that reading a work of fiction can transport a person into the body of the protagonist . Neurons of this region have been associated with creating sensations for the body, so that just thinking about running, for example, can activate the neurons associated with the physical act of running. ‘The neural changes that we found, associated with physical sensation and movement systems, suggest that reading a novel can transport you into the body of the protagonist, ’Professor Berns said. ‘We already knew that good stories can put you in someone else’s shoes in a figurative sense. Now we’re seeing that something may also be happening biologically.’ He claims that the neural changes are not immediate reactions as they linger five days after the participants completed the novel. Professor Berns said: ‘It remains an open question how long these neural changes might last.’ ‘But the fact that we’re detecting them over a few days for a randomly assigned novel suggests that your favorite novels could certainly have a bigger and longer-lasting effect on the biology of your brain.’ Reading Jane Austen novels closely activates the areas of the brain more commonly associated with movement and touch, according to a previous study by U.S. researchers. The findings surprised neuroscientists who expected to see changes in regions of the brain, which regulate attention as the main differences between casual and focused reading. But the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans looked as they would if readers were physically placing themselves within the story as they analysed it. Test subjects were asked to read in two ways: sometimes they were asked . to casually browse the text, as they might do in a bookshop; other times . they were asked to delve deep, as a scholar might study a text. Natalie Phillips, professor of 18th Century Literature and Culture at Michigan State University, who led the study, said: 'What's been taking us by surprise in our early data analysis is how much the whole brain - global activations across a number of different regions - seems to be transforming and shifting between the pleasure and the close reading.' As volunteers read, Professor Phillips and her team scanned their brains while simultaneously tracking their eye movements, breathing and heart rate. Unexpectedly they found that close reading activated parts of the brain usually more involved in movement and touch - as though readers were physically placing themselves in the story. The research fits into a new interdisciplinary field sometimes called literary neuroscience. Other researchers are looking at how poetry and rhythm affect the brain as well as how metaphors excite sensory regions. Their research hopes to reveal a more complete picture of the mysteries of human cognition and is an important crossing point between the arts and the sciences.","Researchers from Emory University in Atlanta Georgia used fMRI scanners to identify brain networks associated with reading stories .

Hours earlier Barack Obama announced the US would extend their sanctions to seven more oligarchs close to Mr Putin, and 17 businesses linked to them. In an update on the crisis, Mr Hague told the Commons the latest clashes yesterday - in which the mayor of the city of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine was shot in the back - were ‘deplorable’. The Mayor, Hennady Kernes, a controversial figure for both sides, was reportedly out cycling on the city’s outskirts when approached by an unknown gunman. He was in a ‘grave but stable’ condition last night, his office said. A former supporter of the ousted pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukoych and critic of the pro-EU protests which deposed him, he has recently spoken out for a united Ukraine and against the pro-Moscow insurgents who have seized government buildings, set up roadblocks and called for Russian annexation of eastern Ukraine. Western countries accuse Moscow of supporting these separatist gunmen occupying official buildings in several eastern cities and last week seized seven Western military observers. Mr Hague, who was questioned by some MPs about why the sanctions fell short of a boycott of Russia’s financial and energy interests, said preparations for a third tier of EU sanctions, which would have far reaching economic and trade measures were ‘well advanced’. The 15 individuals announced yesterday takes the number of Russians subject to EU sanctions to 48. Their names will be released by the EU today. The US list hits close aides of Mr Putin, including Igor Sechin, a former KGB officer now head of oil giant Rosneft. Scroll down for video . The EU is set to slap travel bans on 15 individuals - including members of Putin's inner circle . Fighting for life: Gennady Kernes, the mayor of Kharkiv, was shot in the back today. Just last week, he rallied pro-Russian supporters during a demonstration at the town's city hall . Mr Hague said £63 billion worth of capital has been moved out of Russia since the crisis began, and its economy is forecast to shrink this year. ‘Russia is already paying a serious price for its actions and the longer it breaches the independent sovereignty of Ukraine the heavier the price it will pay’, he said. ‘Russia’s actions betray their fear of democracy and the rule of law taking root in their neighbourhood. These actions are not consistent with being a strong and confident country and are also in breach of international agreements and the UN charter to which Russia is a party. 'It is in Russia’s power to help find ways for tensions to be reduced in Ukraine and the doors of diplomacy remain fully open.’ Mr Hague said the Ukrainian government had behaved with ‘immense restraint’ in the face of provocation, while the Russian government had failed to take ‘a single positive step’.

Over the past two weeks groups of masked militant with automatic weapons have been seizing government buildings in eastern cities to destabilise Ukraine -  in open defiance of a peace deal signed in Geneva last week, which called for them to be surrendered. Yesterday gunmen took over a building in the city of Kostyantynivka – 100 miles from the Russian border. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said Ukraine was the greatest threat to the European security order ‘in decades’ and raised the spectre of war again in Europe, which many people had thought was now ‘all but impossible’. President Obama said the US was prepared to go further if the situation escalated. ‘The goal is not to go after Mr Putin personally,’ Mr Obama said, ‘The goal is to change his calculus with respect to how the current actions that he’s engaging in in Ukraine could have an adverse impact on the Russian economy over the long haul.’","EU set to place travel bans and asset freezes on 15 individuals .

"Asso Salhi was jailed for six years for rape at Maidstone Crown Court after attacking the teenage girl at a friends house in March 2013 . A man who raped a teenage girl while she slept following a night out has been jailed for six years. Asso Salhi, 25, attacked the girl while they were both staying overnight at a friend's house on March 1, 2013. The victim said she had been drunk 'but aware' after going to nightclubs in the centre of Gravesend, Kent. She arrived at her friend's house in the early hours, took off her boots and went to sleep on top of a duvet with Salhi next to her. But despite others being in the house she woke up to Salhi raping her, and afterwards ran out of the property to alert a friend who called police. Officers arrived and arrested him at the scene. Shalhi claimed that his victim had initiated the sex, although the jury found him guilty of rape. Recorder Anesta Weekes QC jailed Salhi, of Gravesend, Kent, for six years at Maidstone Crown Court. He told Salhi, who did not go into the witness box to give evidence, that his name would appear on the sex offenders' register. DC Victoria Martlew of Kent Police, said: 'Salhi has denied raping this young woman from the very beginning, blaming her and insisting she had come on to him. 'He took advantage of his victim when she was asleep and at her most vulnerable and has shown absolutely no remorse for the tremendous ordeal he put her through.' Questioned by Charlotte Newell, defending, the teenager said she ran out 'as fast as I could'. She said: 'I would not dream of thinking he wanted to have sex with me. I was drunk. I just wanted to go to sleep. I crashed out. 'I have never had sex with anyone other than I have been in a relationship with. I would never have sex with somebody I hardly knew. 'I didn't call out while I was being raped because I was scared. 'As soon as I got out of bed I was looking around for my phone. I was saying to the others to wake up. I was scared. I was shocked. 'He didn't try to stop me leaving. He stayed in bed and didn't say anything. I ran out as fast as I could.'

"The head of New York tourism has defended its controversial decision to name Taylor Swift as the city's Global Welcome Ambassador. Fred Dixon, President and CEO of NYC & Company, said that the Pennsylvanian-born, Nashville-raised pop star was a suitable choice given that it is a 'city of immigrants'. The official marketing and tourism organisation for New York last week announced a year-long campaign starring the 24-year-old's song Welcome to New York. Scroll down for video . 'Starry-eyed optimism': NY Tourism has hit back at critics of Taylor Swift as Global Welcome Ambassador . The move was met with widespread criticism with many New Yorkers voicing their disappointment that somebody who has lived in the city less than a year would be chosen as its ambassador. But Dixon, who is in the UK this week to attend London's World Travel Market, told TTG that traditional New Yorker's view of the city has 'been done'. Swift was chosen because of her newcomer status, not in spite of it, Dixon said. 'New York is a city of immigrants, not many of us were born in New York – we’ve all followed our dreams there.' Head of tourism: Dixon is CEO of NYC & Company . Dixon revealed that Taylor's new role came about after he met her manager by chance, which led to an invitation to the singer's recently-purchased $20m (£12m) Tribeca apartment, where he first listened to her song dedicated to New York. '[Taylor's] song Welcome To New York is written from the perspective of a newcomer, that starry-eyed optimism and overwhelming energy you feel when you first come to New York, and she wanted to share that. 'It’s like we wrote it for our own brand,' he said, adding that Swift's reach on social media and her 'authentic' engagement with her huge following is something that money can't buy. The Shake It Off hitmaker is donating her time to the campaign for which she appears in a series of videos sharing her enthusiasm for the city. During an appearance on Good Morning America to mark the start of the campaign,  Swift said: 'When I love something, I'm very vocal about it, I'm vocal about it with my music. I heart NYC: Taylor Swift, pictured enjoying the sights  in August, is a passionate New York fan . Global jetsetter: Swift was pictured today arriving in Japan . 'I just go around like, ""Everybody! New York is amazing!"" So I think they just picked up on that and gave me a title.' In one of the campaign videos the singer explains some common slang words, such as 'stoop' (commonly known as a porch) and 'bodega', the 24-hour corner shops which sell 'almost anything'. In another video, she assures visitors that in New York, 'people are very friendly and there's also a lot of heart here. And it's easy to get around. People will help you if you ask for help.' No stranger to the bright lights: The singer performed on New Year's Eve 2013 in Times Square . Resident: The 24-year-old recently bought a £12million property in the city's Tribeca neighbourhood . 'What makes New York City New York City is that it is unlike anywhere else in the world. 'It's almost like this city has its own heartbeat. You can find fashion that inspires you, art that inspires you, humanity that inspires you. 'Everywhere you look. It's impossible not to fall in love or be affected by something in New York City. 'I think what brought me to New York is still a little bit of a mystery to me. 'Every day I would wake up with this feeling, like I need to be in New York. It pulled me here like a magnet. 'I was intimidated by the fact that it was bright and bold and loud, and now I know that I should run towards things like that. 'I should run towards things that are absolutely overwhelmingly electric. 'There's so much happening right in front of me, so many stories playing out that for my writing it definitely helped inspire an album that is by far the most proud of in my career.' Following the announcement last week, the decision was attacked by New Yorkers, who felt the singer was not suitable for the role. 'I'm incensed! It's insulting,' said Twisted Sister singer Dee Snider, who was born in Queens. He told the New York Daily News: 'She doesn't have any life experience here, or connection to the town. 'There's so many others — Jerry Seinfeld, for instance, if you want a big name,' Snider added. 'But Taylor Swift is the pop culture queen, so she moves into town, and she's the ambassador.' The NYC Go Facebook page was flooded with negative responses. 'Taylor Swift has nothing to do with NYC, she is a bad representation. Get a real NY'er instead,' commented Ilana Vickers. 'Seems like a truly ridiculous ambassador,' wrote another poster, Kiersten Kehrer. 'We couldn't have asked for a better synergy between Taylor and NYC & Company to tell our story about what makes New York City, New York City,' NYC Go told MailOnline Travel last week. 'This is a campaign targeting visitors to New York City rather than locals. 'There's a separate campaign encouraging locals to explore their own city that celebrates the views of locals.'","CEO Fred Dixon praised Swift's 'starry-eyed optimism and energy'

"Finding nice things to write about Steven Gerrard isn’t a challenge. Answering the unanswered questions remains the big issue with this Liverpool legend. I’m not talking about the reasons behind his departure – Liverpool have their side of the story, Gerrard’s allies will have his side. But he’s too decent a guy to openly encourage criticism of the club he has been a massive part of for so many years. There are two questions that still need analysis in my view: First, should Gerrard have left Liverpool at some point in his career? My answer is yes, and it’s not with the benefit of hindsight. Steven Gerrard announced he will quit Liverpool at the end of the season to play in the United States . Gerrard prepares to take a corner in Liverpool's FA Cup third round win over AFC Wimbledon on Monday . Gerrard's display in the 2005 Champions League final was arguably the best individual performance ever . Gerrard rises above the Milan defence to score and start Liverpool's comeback in the 2005 final in Istanbul . Forget Captain America and Superman, no fictional superhero comes close to what the real thing achieved in Istanbul in 2005. Gerrard’s performance was from the most excitable, over-dramatic comic book of all time. It ranks as one of the very best individual performances in a football match the world has ever seen, if not the very best. What makes it even more remarkable is that Gerard went through that Champions League-winning season feeling unwanted by Liverpool, unsure about the direction in which the club was going, and with his family witnessing disgusting abuse towards him from Liverpool fans. Gerrard was able to rise above that to guarantee a place in Liverpool, and football, history. That in itself is a measure of the man, and it is why the time was right straight after that Champions League victory for Gerrard to leave Anfield. Gerrard's loyalty to Liverpool meant he never collected a coveted Premier League medal . Rafa Benitez managed to persuade Gerrard to stay at Liverpool in 2004 despite interest from many big clubs . Gerrard is consoled by Jose Mourinho after scoring an own goal in the 2005 League Cup final . In 2004 Gerrard had been linked with a move to Chelsea, whose new manager at the time, Jose Mourinho, spoke highly and openly about the Liverpool captain. Gerrard saw the speculation and told Liverpool he wished to stay but that he also wanted guarantees that the squad would be strengthened as they struggled to compete for the title. Throughout the 2004-05 season, while Gerrard was ripping up trees across Europe, Liverpool failed to put a new contract on the table for him, yet Rafa Benitez was in his ear telling him to sign a new deal. Rafa had already told Gerrard privately that the club did not have a lot of money to spend in the transfer market, so the captain wanted to know how Liverpool planned to compete with players like Josemi, Djimi Traore and Salif Diao in their ranks. And then the moment that for me should have sealed Gerrard’s departure: February 27, 2005, when Cardiff hosted the League Cup final. Jose Mourinho and Gerrard meet during the 2005 League Cup final in Cardiff - but he never joined Chelsea . Didier Drogba (left) and Mateja Kezman lift the League Cup for Chelsea after Gerrard's own goal rescued them . Liverpool led from the first minute, Gerrard’s own goal levelled it with just over 10 minutes to go, and Chelsea went on to win in extra-time. Gerrard’s mum was in the stands, and around her some Liverpool fans were calling the captain a 'traitor' and calling his wife a 'slag' and a 'slut' and accusing him of only being interested in money. According to those fans, Gerrard had scored the own goal because he wanted to join Chelsea. His mum was distraught, and so was Gerrard. Still this colossus played his heart out for the club and the fans, and that special night in Istanbul came just a few months after the Chelsea defeat in Cardiff. After the Champions League final Gerrard told the club he was ready to sign for five years at Liverpool. Even then nobody at Anfield seemed in a hurry to sort out Gerrard’s new deal. Barcelona, Roma, Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Chelsea had all shown serious interest in signing Gerrard. He wasn’t short of options at home or abroad. Leading Liverpool to European glory was the perfect riposte to the critics after transfer speculation . All was forgiven by the fans after Gerrard's heroic performance in Istanbul, delivering a fifth European Cup . His stunning effort and quality had been the key factor in winning the Champions League, but they were miles off winning the Premier League title he craved. Gerrard could work miracles in certain matches, but not over a 38-game season. He felt badly treated by the club, he had been abused by a pocket of fans, and the surplus of mediocre signings showed the club’s ambition did not match his. He’d proved anything that needed proving in Istanbul. The summer of 2005 was the time for Gerrard to seek a new challenge. I admire his loyalty of course, but in my view it was misplaced, and that’s when he should have left. And now, less than a year after quitting England to focus on Liverpool, the club have not matched Gerrard’s loyalty by making it so easy for him to leave. Second, was he better than Frank Lampard? Again my answer is yes, and that has been confirmed for me by the lack of class Lampard has shown towards Chelsea Football Club and its fans this season. A simple text from a Chelsea-supporting friend of mine on New Year's Day read: 'Happy New Year! Lampard – what a w*****!' Frank Lampard oining Manchester City on loan from New York City after a long career with Chelsea . Lampard's legendary status at Stamford Bridge is in danger of being revoked after moving to City . Lampard was rightly revered by Chelsea fans but the mood has changed among the Blues faithful . Lampard is a Premier League legend, and while the record books will mark his contribution to Chelsea’s incredible years of success with him sparkling in their midfield, that legend status among the Stamford Bridge faithful is in danger of being revoked. To go to their title rivals is bad enough. To choose to stay there for the whole season is a slap in the face to the Chelsea fans. It’s something I do not believe Gerrard would do to the Liverpool fans. In terms of their ability on the pitch, Lampard shows class at getting into the box from midfield and scoring goals. Gerrard has so much more and he has been class at virtually everything he has done. Gerrard is a born leader as well, a classic captain. He’s made a team shine despite being surrounded by mediocrity, Lampard only ever did it with quality players around him. Lampard and Gerrard could have worked together for England but were played in the wrong system . If England had played three in midfield – Carrick behind Gerrard and Lampard – they could have played together. But even our foreign coaches seemed obsessed with 4-4-2. In the World Cup in 2006, Sven Goran Eriksson told Gerrard to hold back while Lampard went forward. What kind of coach thinks telling a player like Gerrard in his prime to play within himself is a good idea? People will have different views on whether Gerrard should have left Liverpool, and whether he was better than Lampard. Let the debate rage on. All I know is that I will miss Steven Gerrard, the Premier League will miss him. And I believe Liverpool will lack leadership and quality when a man regarded by many as their greatest ever player has departed.","Steven Gerrard will leave Liverpool in the summer for the United States .

"It's a death ray on wheels. The Army has successfully tested a futuristic laser weapon capable of shooting football-sized mortar rounds. The truck-mounted weapon, known as the High Energy Laser Mobile Demonstrator (HEL MD), gives a hint at what a weapon of the future could look like. Using an invisible laser beam to exact targets, the rounds are capable of taking down drones from the sky and even misiles. The Army tested its HEL MD laser at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico for nearly six weeks starting in mid-November, ABC News reported. Scroll down for video ... Almost there: The truck-mounted laser weapons the army hope will prove to be a game-changer on the battlefield . The device was equipped with a 10-kilowatt solid state laser and a radar system mounted atop a heavy truck. During . the tests a 'quarter-sized' invisible laser beam successfully targeted . and destroyed more than 90 incoming mortar rounds and six to seven . unmanned drones. Terry Bauer, the project manager for the laser . program, told ABC News the test results were 'above and beyond' what . they had expected going into the testing. 'We had no thoughts that this 10-kilowatt would be as successful n doing that as it has been,' he said. Mortars are  common battlefield weapons that are hard to protect against because they can be fired from short distances. Light speed: This artist's impression shows how the team behind the new weapon imagine it will work in practice . The mortars used in the test were standard 60 millimeter rounds – the length of a football — fired from a distance of less than two kilometers in salvos of two to three mortar rounds each. The laser’s success rate against incoming mortar shells indicates that battlefield protection from the small explosive rounds could be possible in a few years. Army video of the laser tests shows the laser targeting the mortar so that it burns up in mid-air and does not explode when it completes its trajectory. 'We turn it into a rock, basically,' said Bauer. Large test drones flying five kilometers from the laser system came to crash into the New Mexico desert by aiming the laser at the tail of the unmanned aircraft. An infrared camera on the video captured how a small dot of light on the tail slowly grew in intensity, forcing the craft to lose navigational control.  The laser can also be used for less offensive purposes by dialing back its intensity to blind sensors aboard the drones. Plans call for shrinking the size of the laser system while also boosting its strength to 50 kilowatts, and ultimately 100 kilowatts.   Shrinking its size will make it easier to mount on more mobile vehicles that can be used on the battlefield. Increasing the wattage will allow the beam to hit faster-moving targets at greater distances and in a shorter amount of time.  For example,  a 100 kilowatt laser beam will be able to bring down a target in a tenth of the time it currently takes for a 10 kilowatt laser. The laser is able to fire and target only one incoming target at a time, so the idea is that when the lasers are fully operational they will be grouped in teams of three or five to protect against multiple incoming rounds. These laser units could be deployed in the future to help protect frontline units or bases . Ultimately the laser could be used against faster moving aircraft and cruise missiles. The Navy made waves earlier this year when it unveiled that its own laser mounted aboard a destroyer had brought down test drones and which in the future could be used to fend off fast-moving attack boats. Current plans call for the Navy’s laser to be tested aboard the USS Ponce, which is permanently stationed in the Persian Gulf. The next phase of testing for the Army’s laser will be early next year when it is taken to an Air Force base along Florida’s Gulf Coast to see how it handles a marine environment. So far the Army’s laser testing program has cost about $13 million a year since it began in 2011.  But over the long term it looks like a good deal as the cost of taking out each mortar round is estimated to be the price of a cup of diesel fuel.","Land-based laser weapon was being trialled for missile defense .

"A devout Muslim held his ex-wife prisoner on the toilet for an hour and physically assaulted her as punishment for wearing Western clothes. Khalique Miah has been jailed for 18 months for the attack on Zahanara Begum. She was on the loo when her former husband  burst in dressed in black, wielding a hammer and referring to her underwear as 'Satan'. Miah, 35, covered her mouth with a gloved hand to stop her screaming, punched her in the chest and stomach then climbed on top of her, holding her in place, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Khalique Miah was jailed for 18 months at Snaresbrook Crown Court for the attack on his ex-wife . He started haranguing her about her plucked eyebrows, shaved legs and highlighted hair, telling her she should not wear Western clothes and calling her knickers 'Satan'. The couple’s three-year-old daughter woke up and started crying, but Miah refused to let Mrs Begum go and comfort her. After an hour she begged for her freedom and he relented, telling her to get in the bath. He then took her into the living room, where the father-of-two said her hair would have to go. She agreed, not realising what he meant until he went into the kitchen, fetched a pair of scissors and started snipping it off into a carrier bag. By this point it was nearly 3am, but Mrs Begum decided to wake the couple’s children in the hope their presence would stop Miah hurting her. The defendant pocketed his ex-wife’s mobile phone, cut her landline and refused to let her leave the flat until 10am the next day, when she persuaded him she wanted to give the marriage another go. He agreed to phone her family and when they arrived at the address in Whitechapel, East London, Mrs Begum asked them to call the police. Miah admitted false imprisonment and assault causing actual bodily harm. Passing sentence, Judge Simon Wilkinson said the victim had been through a 'terrifying ordeal' at the hands of her former husband. He said: 'At 11pm, you arrived at her address unannounced and uninvited. You were dressed in black and carrying a hammer in the waistband of your trousers. 'You surprised her when she was sitting on the WC in her bathroom. She could not have been more vulnerable. 'You put your gloved hand over her mouth to stifle her screams then punched her and slapped her to the chest area. 'When you finally allowed her off the toilet seat you cut off her hair with a pair of scissors. You also cut her landline and took her mobile phone. Such conduct cannot and will not be tolerated.' Miah, who works at Tesco in Bow, East London, has no previous convictions and had been on the supermarket’s fast-track management programme. He was married to Mrs Begum for eight years and they had two children, now aged three and seven. Mathew Dance, defending, said: 'He has indicated genuine remorse. He says he has learned his lesson. 'He wants to put all this behind him and get on with his life.' Miah, of Whitechapel, pleaded guilty to false imprisonment and assault causing actual bodily harm.","Khalique Miah held Zahanara Begum in the bathroom for more than an hour .

"Syrian expert Elizabeth O'Bagy, who was sacked after lying about having a PhD, has apologised for misleading people . A expert on Syria whose work was quoted by senior politicians as they debated military action has finally admitted she that she lied over her degree and said sorry. A week after she was sacked from her job as an analyst with the Institute of War, Elizabeth O'Bagy has said that not only did she not earn a doctorate from Georgetown University, but she never even attended the PhD program there. And the researcher, whose op-ed in the Wall Street Journal was cited by Secretary of State John Kerry and Senator John McCain in discussions over whether to launch a missile strike on Syria, has apologised for her 'many mistakes' and 'extremely poor judgement'. O'Bagy, who was hired by the Institute of War a year ago as a research analyst, wrote an opinion piece in the WSJ on 30 August entitled On The Front Lines Of Syria's Civil War. In the article she said rebels in Syria were divided into distinct groups: moderate and extreme - a key point in the debate over whether to intervene in the war-torn country. Kerry and McCain agreed that Syria was a secular state and hailed her op-ed as evidence that the rebels were not the jihadists that some were suggesting.  McCain even said her article was 'important'. However a week after the article was published it emerged that O'Bagy was affiliated to the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a group that supports the removal of Assad from power, and that she had connections with rebel groups in the country. When it was subsequently discovered that O'Bagy had not received a doctorate as she had claimed, she was fired from the Institute of War, although her employers were still under the impression that she had attended the course and had simply not completed her disseration. Last night, however, the controversial analyst admitted that she had not even attended the PhD program in Georgetown at all. Secretary of State John Kerry and Senator John McCain both cited O'Bagy's op-ed on the Syrian rebels . She told the Daily Beast she was only enrolled in a master's program at the university and had applied to join the MA/Ph.D course but was never accepted. In a statement to the website, O'Bagy said: 'I would like to deeply apologize to every person with whom I have worked, who has read and depended upon my research, and to the general public. 'While I have made many mistakes and showed extremely poor judgment, I most particularly regret my public misrepresentation of my educational status and not immediately disclosing that I had not been awarded a doctorate in May, 2013.' She apologized to colleagues and others she had misled, adding: 'Their anger and distrust is understandable, however, I never intended to willfully deceive anyone.' O'Bagy, who has also now left the SETF as a result of the exposed deception, said that she still stood by her work on Syria.","Elizabeth O'Bagy's article on Syrian rebels was quoted by top politicians .

"Dressed in a floor-skimming crimson gown, the Netherlands' Queen Máxima was every inch the royal style icon as she arrived for the traditional Prinsjesdag [Prince's Day] session of the Dutch Parliament. With her husband King Willem-Alexander, 47, by her side, Máxima, 43, cut a dramatic figure as she stepped out of the gold-gilt state coach outside the Parliament building in the Hague. Sporting a royal blue sash of office and a neat crimson cap, she and her husband then processed into the chamber where MPs were waiting for the traditional royal speech setting out the next year's business. Royal welcome: King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands and his wife Queen Maxima wave to crowds . The Dutch equivalent of the State Opening of Parliament, Prinsjesdag sees the monarch give details of the government's programme for the next financial year, as well as budget allocations. With the sixth largest economy in the Eurozone, the Netherlands one of the few still powering ahead - a small wobble earlier this year notwithstanding - despite the malaise elsewhere. The country was also hit by tragedy earlier this year when Malaysia Airways Flight MH17 was shot down on its flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, killing 193 Dutch nationals. Neither, however, stopped well-wishers from gathering in the Hague to greet the royals, who have been on the throne of the Netherlands for just over a year. Big arrival: The royal couple arrive at the Parliament Building in the Hague ahead of the King's speech . Big moment: King Willem-Alexander, 43, sets out the Dutch government's plans for the next year . Round of applause: Maxima looked thrilled at the positive response to her husband's speech to Parliament . Following the King's speech, the royal couple were driven to the Noordeinde Palace, where they later appeared on the balcony to wave to crowds. There, they were joined by Willem-Alexander's younger brother Prince Constantijn and his wife Princess Laurentien. The group of four smiled broadly as they waved to well-wishers, while their mother, the former Queen Beatrix, 76, was also present and waved to crowds from the King's Office. The Argentina-born Dutch Queen has seen her popularity soar in recent months thanks to her tireless work on behalf of the MH17 families. She has also attended some of the repatriation ceremonies and was seen sobbing from her perch beside Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the first flight arrived back on Dutch soil. Packed: The Dutch Parliament building in the Hague was crammed with MPs waiting to hear the speech .

"Before we get into Santi Cazorla’s rating for his masterful display against two of the most mediocre midfield performers in Manchester City’s recent history, first some insight. This is my long-held view, but the match ratings are a complete waste of time. They are not based on a calculations from Opta, heat maps, passing percentages and touches of the ball to give a considered statistical view after careful analysis. Arsenal's Spanish playmaker Santi Cazorla produced a masterful performance in his side's 2-0 win at Manchester City on Sunday... but it was only worthy of a rating of 7/10 online and 7.5 in Monday's Daily Mail . Cazorla skips past the grounded Frank Lampard during Arsenal's win at the Etihad Stadium . Cazorla scores his penalty to give Arsenal a lead midway through the first half on Sunday . Click here to read Neil Ashton's ratings from the Etihad Stadium in full . They are done by one person who is responsible for umpteen other duties, often at the same time, under the pressure of deadlines of website and newspaper. It means studying 22 players plus substitutes, along with the referee, both managers and sending it on the final whistle. Within minutes it is online. Cazorla was the go-to man on Sunday, an easy pick because he scored a penalty and sent in the free-kick for Olivier Giroud to score Arsenal’s second. The Independent, The Sun and The Express gave him 8/10, he was 9/10 in the Mirror and good luck to them. He was man of the match - and there was a case for it - in the Daily Star and the Guardian, but not for me. Life would be easier if I followed the golden rule - give the highest mark to the player who scored the winner, or set it up - and you won’t get clubbed to death on Twitter. Cazorla delivered the free-kick from which Olivier Giroud (right) headed Arsenal's second goal . Fernando tries to close down Cazorla as the Arsenal man picks yet another pass . How Sportsmail's Neil Ashton rated Arsenal's midfield and forward line in Monday's Daily Mail . This is the life of a football reporter, looking up from a laptop screen and hoping to see a killer pass or a key decision in real time. If you don’t, you ask a colleague sitting next to you for his opinion or pray to God that a crackly TV in the press box is a) working and b) about to show a replay. There is no time, so there is a reliance to use obvious match-winning contributions, such as a penalty struck with conviction in the 23rd minute or a free-kick in the 67th, to stand out. There is no hard and fast rule about marking players out of 10 because people will aggregate them based on various values, all of them refined over a period of years based on past experiences. Perhaps it is little wonder Cazorla stood out for so many people because it is so rare for him to have this kind of influence on a game. Cazorla is a good player, but not a great and let’s not pretend otherwise. Yes perhaps he probably did deserve more than a 7 (online) and 7.5 in a considered appraisal in the paper, but good God you would think there was a fire judging by the social media feeds, along with the customary email from the Head of Sport Lee Clayton. There is no need for an alarm in my house any more because he takes care of it before 6am after a game with his complaints, because I didn’t read the game the same way as he did. I got one after West Ham v Everton and another this morning. This game could easily have seen Francis Coquelin, stationed in front of Arsenal’s back four, or Laurent Koscielny given man of the match for his job on Sergio Aguero. But there is an alternative, which is to scan the team-sheet before kick-off and think that some poor soul like Olivier Giroud will have his work cut out today in a 4-1-4-1. He was the real man of the match, busting his balls as he worked the line across one of the best - and certainly most expensive - defences in the Barclays Premier League. Francis Coquelin was also possibly worthy of the man of the match accolade for his performance . Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny (left) kept a close check on danger man Sergio Aguero . Giroud was Ashton's choice for star man after taking on City's formidable back line . It was interesting to learn that Danny Murphy - a man who really does have a full appreciation and understanding of the game - gave Giroud man of the match on talkSPORT on Monday morning, but what would he know, eh? There are people (myself included) who will tell you that Pablo Zabaleta is the best right-back in the history of the Barclays Premier League. Let’s pause there for a moment. Then there are City supporters who would scream at you in the street if you dare to claim that John Terry is a better central defender than their captain Vincent Kompany. Pause again. Tougher to make a case for Martin Demichelis, but let’s not pretend he didn't win four Bundesliga titles with Bayern Munich, one Premier League title with City or start the 2014 World Cup final against Germany. Pause again. Giroud takes on City defender Martin Demichelis during the match at the Etihad Stadium . There is also Gael Clichy, a decent enough left back but without being anything special. Four, plus the formidable presence of City keeper Joe Hart, against one is not a fair fight. Giroud still managed to play a part in the move that led to Arsenal’s opening goal and finished the game off when he read Cazorla’s free-kick to steer the ball beyond Hart. That is why Giroud was man of the match. The beauty about football is that it is all about opinions. And that’s mine.","Sportsmail's Neil Ashton awarded Santi Cazorla a rating of 7 .
Cazorla scored the first goal and set up Olivier Giroud for the second .
But ratings should take into account far more than this .
That's why Giroud was more deserving of the star man award .
He took on City's daunting back line without fear and scored crucial goal ."
"A 14-year-old Mississippi boy, his male police officer lover and two other men have been arrested in a twisted plot to murder the teen's father, bury the body in a shallow grave and destroy the evidence, authorities and family members say. Blake Thompson allegedly lured his father Kenneth Thompson, 53, into a trap in Pike County, Mississippi, with the help of Greg Fortenberry, 26, and LeJerrious Perkins, 17, on Sunday. When Mr Thompson arrived, the three suspects slashed his throat, killing him, according the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation. Blake, a teenage runaway, then enlisted the help of 25-year-old Jasper Pittman, a police officer in Brookhaven, Mississippi, to bury his father's body in a shallow grave and burn his pickup truck, police said. Arrested: Blake Thompson, 14, (left) allegedly conspired to kill his own father and enlisted the help of police officer Jasper Pittman, 25, (right). Family members say teenage Blake and Pittman were 'in a relationship' This is the home in McComb, Mississippi, where Blake, Pittman and two other alleged accomplices were living . Family members told the Jackson Clarion-Ledger that Blake was 'in a relationship' with Pittman and had been staying at his house. Police charged Pittman with sexual battery and allege he sexually penetrated the boy. Investigators later found the Mr Thompson body buried on Pittman's property in McComb, a police report said. Mr Thompson, who worked full-time at the local Wal-Mart distribution center, had been fighting to keep his son Blake out of trouble since the death of Mr Thompson's wife five years ago, Blake's aunt, Lillian Mallard, told the Clarion-Ledger. Thompson, who also had three other children, worked hard for his family, Ms Mallard said. 'I have nothing bad to say about him. The father was a good man. He was always kind, good-hearted,' she told the newspaper. 'He was keeping his grandchildren every day. A really good guy. He maintained the house, maintained everything.' 'Accomplices': LeJerrious A. Perkins, 17, (left) and Gregory Antonio Fortenberry, 26, (right) allegedly helped Blake lure his father Kenneth Thompson to his death . About Blake, she added: 'His daddy was trying to keep him out of trouble.' Blake had run away from home days before and was staying at Pittman's home, along with Fortenberry and Perkins, authorities say. Mr Thompson looked frantically for the teen, but could not find him. Finally, he got a phone call from one of Blake's co-conspirators telling him where he could pick up his son. When he arrived, police said, Blake, Fortenberry and Perkins killed Mr Thompson. One of Mr Thompson's family members saw Blake and two others driving around the Wal-Mart parking lot on Sunday and called police. The truck was later found in a remote area, burned and discarded on property belonging to one of Pittman's relatives. The Brookhaven Police Department said Pittman had been a police officer for only two weeks and was fired after his arrest. He worked as an officer in nearby McComb for 11 months before that. Pittman is charged with accessory after the fact of murder, arson, conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit arson and sexual battery. Fortenberry and Perkins were both charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder, arson and conspiracy to commit arson. Blake Thompson was charged as an adult. He also faces charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, arson and conspiracy to commit arson.","Blake Thompson, 14, AKA Black, allegedly ran away from home and then lured his father Kenneth Thompson, 53, to his death on Sunday .

"It shows a hunched couple walking with the aid of a walking stick and is used to warn drivers to beware older people crossing the road. But the government's tsar for the elderly says the road sign should be banned because they convey a message that older people are 'frail and disabled' and discourage employers from hiring someone over 50. Dr Ros Altmann, the government's business champion for older workers, claims the 'elderly people' sign is discriminatory because it puts off employers. Ros Altmann, the government's business champion for older workers, left says the road traffic sign puts employers off hiring someone over 50 . She is planing to bring the issue to women and equalities minister Jo Swinson at a meeting next month, reported The Sunday Times. Dr Altmann said the signs like the one for elderly people are 'colour stereotypes' and should be abolished. She told MailOnline: 'I would like to see the signs banned - just drop them. 'I don't understand what purpose they serve - in this day and age, do we really need a say that says ""Warning: old people""? It's not very helpful to anybody. 'It just feeds into the social stereotypes that suggest old people are disabled. 'It's one of those things that seeps into the national psyche and we don't think about it.' She added: 'We have got an ageing population in this country. The vast majority are fit and healthy and in no way like that picture of people being stooped over and needing a walking stick. 'The signs give the message that old people are frail and disabled - it contributes to the some of the age discrimination that we know exists in society. 'They belong to a bygone era and I think there is merit in focusing people's attention on something that everybody recognises.' This week, at a meeting of employers, including Centrica and Barclays, she will reveal proposals to offer older people internships to help them start new careers. She added she would like to see the government offer older works the same kind of job subsidies planned for young people.

"'Attack': Michael Callaghan allegedly sexually assaulted a 20-year-old woman on Sunday . A 911 dispatcher told a distraught woman to 'quit crying' after she called to report that she had been raped. The startling lack of sympathy emerged when WSYX asked the Columbus Police Department for a recording of the call that had been placed around 4am on Sunday. The woman can be heard sobbing as she told the female dispatcher that she had awoken in her friend's dorm to a man telling her to carry out a sex act on him - and threatening to shoot her if she did not comply. Afterwards the man allegedly stole cash and an iPhone from the building, which is an off-campus house for sorority girls at Ohio State University. The distraught 20-year-old woman ran from the house and called 911. On the recording, she tells the dispatcher that the man broke into the house full of girls and woke her up with a gun to her head, before assaulting her and stealing the items. When the dispatcher asked her for her address, she said she was from out of town and didn't know exactly where it was. She asked the dispatcher if she was able to trace her phone. 'No. We can't,' the dispatcher says impatiently. 'That's why I need to know where you are.' Scroll down for video .

'Ma'am, you’re going to have to quit crying so I can get the information from you,' the dispatcher responded. And when the woman said she was not sure exactly how the rapist got into the house, the tetchy dispatcher said: 'Well, they're not going to be able to find him with the information that you've given.' By that point, the victim had had enough. 'Don't you understand how horrified I am?' she said through tears. 'I am a 20-year-old from Upper Arlington. I don't know what you deal with every day, but the kind of sympathy you have is zero.' No apologies: Dispatcher chief Lieutenant Marc Dopp said the dispatcher would not be reprimanded because the suspect was caught. He conceded that the call could've been handled better .

Karren Brady - now Baroness Brady of Knightsbridge - takes her seat in the House of Lords . Brady donned traditional ermine robes for the occasion at the House of Lords of Thursday .

The Apprentice star then signed the Upper House's code of conduct and then shook hands with Lord Speaker Baroness D'Souza. She was then greeted by leader of the House Baroness Stowell of Beeston before leaving the chamber to change out of her robes.

"He has spent much of his first fortnight on the job hobnobbing with world leaders and VIPs. But yesterday Pope Francis visited a prison to wash and kiss the feet of convicted criminals. He broke with tradition to hold a major Easter Week service at Casal del Marmo young offenders’ prison in Rome, telling 50 inmates: ‘I’m happy to be with you. Don’t give up hope.’ The foot washing on Maundy Thursday echoes a New Testament passage in which Jesus honours his 12 disciples before his Crucifixion. Scroll down for video . The Pope kisses the feet of one of twelve prisoners during the Holy Thursday ritual . Pope Francis celebrated the ancient rite on Holy Thursday for years as an archbishop and is continuing the tradition in his new office . As archbishop of Buenos Aires, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio would celebrate the ritual foot-washing in jails, hospitals or hospices - part of his ministry to the poorest and most marginalized of society . Francis has carried out similar ceremonies in Argentinian jails. In a first for a Pope, he attended to the feet of two woman prisoners. Several of the 12 were also Muslim. Pope Francis already has officials on . the back foot with his lack of regard for protocol. He has insisted he . will not live in the lavish Papal apartments. On seeing them, he said: . ‘But there is room for 300 people in here.’ At a mass in St Peter’s Basilica . yesterday, he told priests: ‘We need to go out . . . to the outskirts . where there is suffering, bloodshed, blindness that longs for sight, and . prisoners in thrall to many evil masters.’ Those who do not, he said, ‘become . merely dealers in antiques and collectibles, instead of pastors, ending . up dissatisfied and sad’. Previous popes would carry out the foot-washing ritual on Holy Thursday in Rome's grand St. John Lateran basilica and the 12 people chosen for the ritual were priests to represent the 12 disciples . Many of them were Gypsies or North . African migrants, and the Vatican said the 12 selected for the rite . weren't necessarily Catholic. Because the inmates were mostly . minors - the facility houses inmates aged 14-21 - the Vatican and . Italian Justice Ministry limited media access inside. But Vatican Radio . carried the Mass live, and Francis told the detainees that Jesus washed . the feet of his disciples on the eve of his crucifixion in a gesture of . love and service. 'This is a symbol, it is a sign . -washing your feet means I am at your service,' Francis told the . youngsters. 'Help one another. This is what Jesus teaches us. This is . what I do. And I do it with my heart. I do this with my heart because it . is my duty, as a priest and bishop I must be at your service.' Later, the Vatican released a limited . video of the ritual, showing Francis washing black feet, white feet, . male feet, female feet and even a foot with tattoos. As archbishop of Buenos Aires, the . former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio would celebrate the ritual . foot-washing in jails, hospitals or hospices - part of his ministry to . the poorest and most marginalized of society. It's a message that he is . continuing now that he is pope, saying he wants a church 'for the poor.' Previous popes would carry out the . foot-washing ritual on Holy Thursday in Rome's grand St. John Lateran . basilica and the 12 people chosen for the ritual were priests to . represent the 12 disciples. That Francis would include women in . this re-enactment is symbolically noteworthy given the insistence of . some in the church that the ritual be reserved for men only given that . Jesus' disciples were all male, and that the Catholic priesthood that . evolved from the original 12 disciples is restricted to men. 'The pope's washing the feet of women . is hugely significant, because including women in this part of the Holy . Thursday Mass has been frowned on - and even banned - in some . dioceses,' said the Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and author of . ""The Jesuit Guide."" 'It shows the all-embracing love of Christ, who ministered to all he met: man or woman, slave or free, Jew or Gentile.' After the Mass, Francis greeted each of the inmates and gave each one an Easter egg. 'Don't lose hope,' he said. 'Understand? With hope you can always go on.' Italian Justice Minister Paola . Severino, who has made easing Italy's woefully overcrowded prisons a . priority, attended the Mass. Earlier today Pope Francis conducted his first Chrism Mass inside St Peter's Basilica. The mass kick-starts four days of hectic activities leading up to . Easter this Sunday.

Important: Pope Francis conducts his first Chrism Mass inside St Peter's Basilica on the morning of Holy Thursday today . During the service, he urged . Catholic priests to devote themselves to helping the poor and suffering . instead of worrying about careers as Church 'managers'. 'We need to go out, then, in order to . experience our own anointing (as priests) ... to the outskirts where . there is suffering, bloodshed, blindness that longs for sight, and . prisoners in thrall to many evil masters,' he said during the Mass. The . 76-year-old former Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina has inherited a . Vatican rocked by a scandal in which documents leaked to the media . spoke of alleged corruption in its administration and depicted prelates . as fighting among themselves to advance their careers. At . the Mass, Francis said priests should not get bogged down in 'introspection' but step outside of themselves and concentrate on those . who need their help. 'Those . who do not go out of themselves, instead of being mediators, gradually . become intermediaries, managers. We know the difference: the . intermediary, the manager ... doesn't put his own skin and his own heart . on the line, he never hears a warm, heartfelt word of thanks,' he said. In the next few weeks, Francis is . expected to start making changes in the Curia, the central bureaucracy . that was at the heart of the so-called 'Vatileaks' scandal.

Spectacular: Pope Francis holds up a copy of the book of the gospel , left. The new pope urged Catholic priests to devote themselves to helping the poor and suffering . Memorable: About 1,600 priests from Rome attended the Mass, with many opting to take pictures of the special occasion . Impressive: Priests listen intently during the spectacular Mass . The . new pope delivered his appeal for priests to live simply and closest to . the needy on the day when the Catholic Church commemorates when Jesus . founded the priesthood at the Last Supper on the night before he died. Speaking . to about 1,600 priests from Rome who attended the Mass, he said those . who did not live in humility close to the people risked becoming . 'collectors of antiques or novelties - instead of being shepherds living . with 'the smell of the sheep'. The . pope took the name Francis after St. Francis of Assisi, who is . associated with austerity and helping the poor. The new pontiff has . already set a clear tone for a humbler papacy and Church. Later today, he will wash and kiss the feet of 12 young inmates at a . youth prison on the outskirts of Rome, at a Holy Thursday ceremony . commemorating Jesus's gesture of humility towards his apostles on the . night before he died.

"A father who killed his wife after he set fire to his family home in a bid to stop his daughter marrying a man he disapproved of was found guilty of murder today. Mohammed Riaz Inayat, 56, flew into a rage when his daughter, Kalsoom Bibi, told him she planned to move to Dubai to marry a policeman. He said she had brought ‘dishonour on the family’ before pouring gallons of petrol over his family home and setting it alight. Mohammed Riaz Inayat (left), 56, was found guilty of murdering his wife today after he set his house on fire . On the night of April 17 Inayat killed his wife Naika and injured his three daughters in a blaze that took seconds to engulf the house. Naika died of carbon monoxide poisoning and one of his daughters, 16-year-old Saimah, who jumped from a bedroom window, suffered 50 per cent burns. He was found guilty at Birmingham Crown Court of murdering his wife and arson but was cleared of attempted murder of his three daughters. During his trial the court heard how the father-of-six soaked seven parts of his home in petrol at about 5am as his family slept - only hours before Miss Bibi, 28, was set to fly to Dubai to marry the CID officer. After initially telling police the fire was started by ‘a gang led by a white middle-aged woman’, he admitted one count of manslaughter. Philip Bennett QC, prosecuting, told the court: ‘For this defendant a love marriage was not appropriate. ‘He was traditional in his beliefs that marriage should be arranged.’ Miss Bibi, who is already divorced from a marriage arranged by her father, met her lover in 2011 but had to travel in secret to see him in Dubai. When her family discovered the affair in December last year, they disapproved, and her father became increasingly angry and upset, the jury heard. Inayat, 56, flew into a rage when his daughter, Kalsoom Bibi (pictured), told him she planned to move to Dubai . Miss Bibi, who works for World Duty Free, told the court: ‘He told me he would kill me and that he would poison himself if I married him. ‘He said I would bring disgrace to the family. He was not happy with it. I understand why he wasn’t happy, it was because he had never met the man. ‘It took him a long time to accept it, but he did in the end because he could see it was what I wanted.’ On the night of the fire Miss Bibi woke to find flames coming under her bedroom door. While his wife, three daughters and a family friend slept upstairs, Inayat used petrol as an accelerant both upstairs and downstairs in the family home and then set it on fire, trapping his family upstairs. Neighbours called the emergency services and they tried in vain to rescue the occupants of the house. The three daughters and family friend jumped from the first floor bedroom windows resulting in them suffering broken bones. When the fire service arrived they entered the house and the found the body of the defendant’s wife in one of the upstairs bedrooms. She had died as a result of smoke inhalation. Miss Bibi suffered a broken arm and three broken vertebrae after leaping from the window of the terraced house in Tyseley, Birmingham. Inayat, who is originally from Pakistan, told the jury he tried to kill himself on the night of the fire, using three kitchen knives. He then claimed he attempted to tie electrical cord around his neck before pouring petrol over himself. Inayat poured gallons of petrol over his family home in Springfield, Birmingham, and set it alight . After the verdict, Zafar Siddique, Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor from West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service, said: ‘Crimes committed to supposedly defend a family’s honour will not be tolerated in our society and today’s conviction of Mohammed Inayat demonstrates that. ‘Honour-based violence and forced marriages are ultimately about men policing the behaviour of women. ‘This can include rights as fundamental as a choice of partner, as in today’s case, and this abuse can escalate frighteningly quickly from controlling behaviour to murder. ‘Inayat committed a dreadful crime, a crime which he committed because he was unable to accept the fact that his daughter wanted to get married to someone that she loved, cared for and wanted to spend the rest of her life with. ‘This he felt brought dishonour to him and his family, but today’s conviction has shown that the shame is his to bear. ‘The CPS will not shy away from tackling honour-based violence. It is a fundamental abuse of human rights and should not be tolerated in any civilised society. ‘Our thoughts are today with the family and friends of Naika Inayat.’","Mohammed Riaz Inayat, 56, flew into a rage when his daughter, Kalsoom Bibi, said she was moving to Dubai to marry a policeman .

"Dozens of Twitter trolls are sending bomb threats to American Airlines, just days after a Dutch teenager was arrested for the same prank. 'Prank' messages are being tweeted to the airline, threatening specific flights or just claiming that bombs are set to go off on a certain date or time. A user calling himself AldoFernz tweeted: '@AmericanAir the bomb goes of in 3 hours.' Scroll down for video . Threats: Twitter trolls have been sending hoax messages to American Airlines . However, after a flood of abuse he took the comment down and wrote: 'my apologies go out to all, but why can't y'all take a joke.' While another user, known as ComedyBatman, wrote: '@AmericanAir You really seem to not care that i’m about to bomb your plane that’s headed to Paris. Btw, my name is Ahmed.' Prank: Twitter users have not taken heed of what happened to Dutch teenager Sarah, who threatened American Airlines . The theme of the tweets was to threaten to be a member of Al Qaeda, much as the Dutch teenager did with her prank from the Twitter account @QueenDemetriax_. One called Sebastian Soko tweeted: 'HI STAY SAFE BECAUSE I'M GOING TO THROW A MASSIVE BOMB AT JUNE 3TH ANY AIRPLANE GOING TO US. ALQAEDA IS STILL ALIVE.' And a user called Cinow75 wrote: 'In two days a bomb is going to explode in one of your planes.' However, he seemed to back out of his prank with a follow-up message reading: '@AmericanAir It's #Joke don't panic ! hahaha' Bad idea: The teen immediately regretted sending this 'joke' bomb threat . The flood of messages comes after a 14-year-old Dutch girl - named Sarah - was arrested in Rotterdam after tweeting a threat to American Airlines and claiming to be an Al Qaeda operative. Roland Ekkers, a spokesman for Rotterdam police, told MailOnline that officers in the city had launched an investigation into the tweet after it was reported around the world. But before detectives could track the girl down, she walked into a police station accompanied by a family member. Mr Ekkers said: 'Police spoke to prosecutors to decide whether we could arrest her and, after some deliberation, we decided that we could arrest her and she has been arrested. 'She is now being interviewed by specially-trained officers who are used to speaking to young offenders.' Mr Ekkers said the girl has not been charged with any offence, but could face charges related to 'making false threats'. It was just a joke: The girl insisted she was joking and not from Afghanistan, but the airline did not reply . Worried: The girl expressed her fear and threw her friend under the bus, anything to avoid being in trouble . The teenager sent: 'hello my name’s . Ibrahim and I’m from Afghanistan. I’m part of Al Qaida and on June 1st . I’m gonna do something really big bye.' However her prank went wrong when American Airlines replied, stating: 'Sarah, we take these threats very seriously. Your IP address and details will be forwarded to security and the FBI.' The young girl's subsequent public meltdown on Twitter, in which she explained that she was joking and begged the airline to reconsider, went viral until her account was suspended., but not before her followers increased to more than 30,000. The teenager wrote in response: 'I always wanted to be famous. But I meant like Demi Lovato famous, not Osama bin laden famous.' Both the American Airlines and Sarah’s tweet were eventually deleted, and it is not exactly clear if any call to the FBI was ever made. ‘We took it down basically because it generated a lot of traffic,’ spokeswoman Dori Alvarez told the New York Daily News. ‘We took it down so we could better focus on our customers.’ Twitter spokesperson declined to comment on the matter to the New York Post, but tweeted that ‘only law enforcement can request private information about Twitter accounts.’ Sarah expressed remorse for the stunt, wondering aloud why she did it – but the she wrote ‘I changed my name to Ibrahim.’","Dozens of users have threatened bomb attacks on American Airlines flights following the Dutch teenager's prank .

"Mauricio Pochettino claims his relationship with Emmanuel Adebayor has recovered after the Tottenham's striker's return to the first team squad. The Spurs manager revealed that he is even considering starting Adebayor in Wednesday's Capital One Cup semi-final first leg against Sheffield United at White Hart Lane. Adebayor was booed by some sections of the Spurs supporters when he returned to the team as a 61st minute substitute during the 2-1 victory over Sunderland on Saturday.

He is an important player in the squad and he is in my plans. 'When I believe I need to give the chance to play him or use him then he will be a good player and an important player.' Tottenham are 180 minutes away from Wembley and Pochettino is determined to lead the club to glory in his first season in charge. He added: 'It is important to reach the final.

"Each December, when the draw for the second round of the Champions League takes place at UEFA headquarters on the banks of Lake Geneva, the ties always look so appealing for the English sides. There are a few ‘oohs’ and ‘ahhs’ as UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino presides over the draw, but generally we are cocksure about the English teams chances of reaching the quarter-finals. When Manchester City draw Barcelona again, we convince ourselves that the Catalans are not the team who redefined the game when they won the Champions League in 2006, 2009 and again in 2011 at Wembley. Luis Suarez scored a terrific double to condemn Manchester City to defeat at the Etihad on Tuesday . The former Liverpool man slots home his second as Barcelona cruised to victory over their rivals . Lionel Messi was in top form despite missing a penalty as Barca produced a masterclass performance . On Tuesday night, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez wiped the floor with City at the Etihad and will wonder how on earth they only won that first leg won 2-1. So, 24 hours later we moved on to the Emirates, brainwashed into believing that Monaco were the weakest team left in the competition because they scored only one goal in the group stages. They kept five clean sheets in six group games, too, but again there was conviction in the air when Arsene Wenger sent out a team with five hugely influential forwards in his side. Arsene Wenger looks on during the shock Champions League defeat at home to French-side  Monaco . Monaco’s response was to rely on a classic European model of counter-attacking football, scoring three times to surely put this tie beyond the reach of Arsenal in the Stade Louis II on March 17. Only the hippest hipster will pretend he knew too much about the way Monaco would approach this game before they trained at the Emirates on Tuesday night. The rest of us were simply guessing. So was Arsene Wenger and as tough as this may sound on a guy who has taken team to the 2006 Champions League final against Barcelona, he was exposed tactically. It was brutal, and ruthless. For all his other qualities, too numerous to mention here, plotting the downfall of the an opponent at the highest level is an area of the game has never been the Arsenal manager’s forte and it is not use pretending otherwise. In Europe, a sharp tactical mind, is gold. Geoffrey Kondogbia (right) dominated the midfield and scored the opening goal for the visitors . Former Tottenham striker Dimitar Berbatov came back to haunt his rivals to score the second goal . Yannick Ferreira Carrasco scored a late third to put Monaco in control ahead of the second leg in France . Pep Guardiola, Carlo Ancelotti, Jose Mourinho and the three-time European Cup winner Bob Paisley are among the great tacticians at this level. Wenger does not belong in that category. Arsenal approached this first leg like they would a home game against Newcastle or Stoke in the Barclays Premier League, expecting to wallop them and send the fans home happy. What a mistake to make as goals from Geoffrey Kondogbia, Dimitar Berbatov and the substitute Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco deep into injury time piled on the misery. This is European football, where the sharpest and most astute tactical minds plot and plan the two legs weeks in advance. For all his faults Mourinho approaches these ties like a battleship commander, placing himself in every single scenario ahead of these mammoth European ties. It is the only way. Jose Mourinho (centre) has become a tactical mastermind in the Champions League and his results say that . It is one of the reasons why the Chelsea manager, who won the European Cup with Porto in 2004 and again with Inter Milan in 2010, has been so successful in this elite environment. Predictably, wearily, it feels like it is time for another radical rethink of the English game after the gung-ho approach of City and Arsenal this week. We are going soft here, fellas, and going out. For City to progress they will have to score a minimum of two goals in Nou Camp on March 18. Arsenal will need at least three. Sure, it is not over yet, and there will be many who point to the success of the English teams in this competition over the past few seasons. Manuel Pellegrini (right) has been critcised by some fans for getting his tactics and team selection wrong . Manchester United beat Chelsea in Moscow (2008), they lost badly in the final to Barcelona (2009 and 2011) before Roman Abramovich at last got his hands on the European Cup in the Allianz Arena in 2012. There is a sense that the English game got a bit too giddy, but then how does that explain Mourinho’s five successive semi-finals, from 2010 to 2014 with Inter (when they won it), Real Madrid and Chelsea? The reason is because he plans for every eventuality, reasoning that the more information he can pass on his players the better the chance they have of getting through. As Wenger has been reminded yet again, sending 11 men out with a ball just won’t wash at this level.","English sides were tactically outwitted in some Champions League games .

"Tim Sherwood's negotiations with QPR have taken another twist after it emerged that he is still in dispute with Brazilian midfielder Sandro. The pair’s relationship disintegrated when Sherwood replaced Andre Villas-Boas as manager of Tottenham last season, but he was then sacked just six months after accepting the job. Sandro was sold to QPR at the end of the season, but he hardly featured under Harry Redknapp because of a knee injury sustained shortly after his move from White Hart Lane. Tim Sherwood's anticipated appointment as QPR manager could be complicated by a dispute with Sandro . QPR director of football Les Ferdinand talks to Sandro on the training ground last week . Sandro criticised Sherwood repeatedly during his spell as manager at Tottenham and even told a Brazilian TV station that he would be sacked at the end of the season. When Sandro was axed by Sherwood for the Barclays Premier League clash with Fulham on March 16, the midfielder posted a message on social media confirming that he was not injured. Sherwood responded by claiming Sandro was ‘not good enough to be in the side at the moment’. He added: ‘When he shows me he’s up to the level of the other players he’ll be back in the squad.’ Sandro in action during his time at Tottenham, where he regularly criticised Sandro . Sandro barely featured under Harry Redknapp at QPR because of persistent knee injury problems . Sandro did return to start Tottenham’s the final game of the season, but he then told ESPN Brazil: ‘Sherwood will leave at the end of the season. Then it’s a new coach - a new everything. I am happy at the moment.’ On Monday, QPR coach Chris Ramsey revealed that they are planning to play Sandro in some Under 21 matches before he returns to the relegation battle with the first team. There are already huge issues at QPR because of a dysfunctional dressing room and Tony Fernandes does not want his new manager to get off on the wrong footing.

"A cat abandoned by its cruel owner because it had cancer was so ravaged by the illness it ripped off its own ears.

"When she began her career as a professional sheep dog Floss was impressive - the sheep responded well to her, she was faster than your average and she certainly looked good. But farmer Dave Issac has reluctantly decided to sell Floss as she is now too big to get through his farmyard gates - because she is  a Peugeot estate car. Mr Issac, 46, who lives on an 180-acre farm near Battle in East Sussex, converted the family car into a working sheep dog in tribute to his dog which had recently died. Scroll down for video . Farmer Dave Issac, 46, (pictured) spent £2,000 converting his Peugeot car into a replica of his favourite dog . He spent £2,000 covering the family car in fur and modifying it until it became an exact replica of Floss, his favourite sheep dog. Floss the sheep dog car, who has a top speed of 40mph, soon proved to be a surprisingly effective herder as the flock of sheep failed to notice they were being rounded up by a much larger animal with headlamps for eyes and an exhaust. Mr Issac, who also has a herd of pedigree Aberdeen Angus cattle, said: 'I know it was a bit of a mad thing to do but it was a tribute to my old sheep dog Floss who passed away. 'I have three kids and we loved her and as a family we all missed her terribly. Mr Issac built a wooden frame and covered the estate car in fur following the death of his favourite sheep dog . The giant car has proven to be an excellent herder - as the sheep don't seem to have noticed the difference . 'So I got together with a friend and we built Floss the sheep dog car in my barn, copying as closely as I could every last detail of my old dog. 'Sheep aren't known for their intelligence and they didn't seem to notice the difference so they were quite happy. 'We even had a charity day on the farm and the car was a big hit.' Mr Issac's unusual experiment has come to an end as Floss the car is simply too big to get around the farm . But Floss the car, which is not licensed to drive on public roads, is now too big to navigate along the narrow farm tracks and through the gates to Mr Issac's fields. Because Floss also required a timber frame built around the Peugeot's chassis to attach the fur, the car is now taking up too much space in the barn of a busy working farm. Mr Issac has decided to sell faithful Floss on eBay and hopes she will go to a good home . Mr Issac added:'They were things we didn't really consider when we built her so with a heavy heart she is going on E-bay. 'It's been a lot of fun and she handles well, is obedient and nice and docile and surprisingly aerodynamic. 'But its back to the tried and tested traditional skills of the sheep dog again.' Mr Isaac hopes Floss the sheep dog car may interest festival organisers or dog charities as a fun car. 'As long as she goes to a good home I'll be happy,' he said. Floss shares more than a few characteristics with the iconic Mutts Cutts van immortalised in the cult film Dumb and Dumber.

"Rangers legend Walter Smith has accused Celtic striker John Guidetti of disrespecting the Ibrox club by claiming he fancies a hat-trick in this weekend’s Old Firm showdown. Last month, the Sweden striker said he hoped to become the first Parkhead player to score a treble against Rangers since Harry Hood in 1973 when the clubs meet in the Scottish League Cup semi-final at Hampden on Sunday. But Smith said the public pronouncement by the on-loan Manchester City man - who has not scored since November - showed a lack of respect towards the club he managed to 10 league titles during two spells at the helm in Govan. Smith also believes his comments give Rangers a better chance of causing a shock. John Guidetti (centre) claimed he fancied scoring a hat-trick for Celtic against Rangers in the Old Firm . Rangers legend Walter Smith (centre) believes Guidetti disrespected Celtic's Old Firm rivals . ‘You’ve got to have an overall respect for the teams you play against,’ said Smith. ‘Rangers will have a respect for Celtic. I’m not so sure Celtic are showing the same respect, with some of the comments their players are making. One of them’s talking about scoring a hat-trick. ‘A few years ago, the games would have been much tighter in terms of how everybody’s perception of how the game is going to be. But I don’t think you can turn round and disrespect your opponents by saying you’re going to score three. ‘If that is an overall feeling that Celtic have got, then it gives Rangers probably a better opportunity than maybe they should have.’ Rangers trail Hearts by 13 points in the Championship while Celtic are top of the Premiership by three points with a game in hand over Aberdeen. Despite the constant chaos on and off the park - with Ally McCoist resigning and McDowall handing his own notice in last week - Smith insists Rangers can upset the ‘overwhelming favourites’. Guidetti, reacting after missing a chance vs Ross County in December, has failed to score since November . ‘Of course they can,’ he told BBC Scotland on Thursday. ‘Their results this season, some have been indifferent, but in the three cup games against Premier Division teams, they’ve won these games. And I don’t think Celtic are as good now as they were a couple of seasons ago.’ Meanwhile, Raith Rovers have backed down and given Rangers an allocation of away tickets to sell for next month’s league meeting between the sides after being reassured over the Ibrox club’s financial predicament. After it emerged this week that Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct would be providing £10million of funding to the cash-strapped Govan outfit, Raith have had a change of heart over the arrangements surrounding the February 20 encounter. The Kirkcaldy club had initially taken the unusual step of selling briefs direct to Rangers fans, with the move stemming from concerns over the Ibrox club’s ability to reimburse Rovers the ticket money had they handled the sale. Guidetti, celebrating scoring a hat-trick against Partick Thistle in October, is confident for the Rangers clash . However, following an angry response to the move and the latest cash injection at Ibrox, the Stark’s Park outfit have handed over a reduced allocation to Rangers, whilst continuing to sell tickets themselves. Eric Drysdale, Rovers’ chief executive, explained: ‘We have reached a compromise with Rangers following developments this week. ‘The temporary funding situation has improved so we have given them a smaller-than-normal allocation. ‘We took the view, quite simply, that we needed to do what we considered to be right in order to protect our own position. ‘We had to limit any risk of our own finances being affected by the on-going difficulties at Ibrox.’ Guidetti, on loan from Manchester City, celebrates setting up a goal for Kris Commons .","Celtic and Rangers meet in Scottish League Cup semi-final on Sunday .

She said: 'Scarlett is going through the phase of waking up a lot in the night but she is so wonderful and great company. 'She loves singing and dancing and is getting into One Direction but I would never push her into doing what I did, I want her to do what she loves.' Just the four of us: Mel says she Mel B, Geri and Emma may consider doing something together in the future . Little Scarlett has good reason to want to follow in her successful mother's footsteps, Mel is currently the female artist with the second most number-one singles in the UK. So what were the best bits from her stellar career? 'Performing at the Olympics with the Spice Girls was the absolute highlight of my career. The Brits in 1997 were fabulous, you all remember the Union Jack dress! 'My duet in 1998 with Bryan Adams was also amazing because it was the first musical thing I did outside of the Spice Girls and it really gave me confidence.' Career highlight: Mel says performing with the girls at the Olympics in 2012 was the best event to date . The question on everyone's lips, as always, is will she and the Spice Girls ever get back together? 'We've talked about it,' she said. 'Victoria doesn't want to, which we completely understand. We are so proud of her and her incredible foray into fashion, it's incredible what she's achieved as a designer. 'The four of us could consider it maybe. We have Victoria's blessing to do that.'

"Alan Pardew will sign his contract to become the new Crystal Palace manager at their training ground on Friday afternoon. The 53-year-old is taking the session at their Beckenham training centre in the morning and will sign his deal to become the new man in charge later in the day. Palace and Newcastle United are both expected to make formal announcements confirming the appointment. Alan Pardew is set to sign a contract to become Crystal Palace boss on Friday afternoon . Pardew was at Crystal Palace's Beckenham training ground on Friday . The former Crystal Palace midfielder pulls into the Eagles' training ground . Pardew's media presentation may yet be delayed further, but as it stands there are no hurdles to his appointment. One of the reasons for the delay is the two clubs continue to thrash out the detail over Pardew's backroom staff. Pardew wants Ben Stevens - Newcastle's head of performance and analysis - to join him at Selhurst Park and this is holding up the announcement. Pardew was in the stands at Villa Park on New Year's Day as Crystal Palace played out 0-0 draw with Aston Villa. Pardew arrived at Villa Park on New Year's Day alongside Palace chief executive Phil Alexander (centre) and chairman Steve Parish (front) Pardew (sat alongside Kevin Blackwell) watched his new Crystal Palace side draw at Aston Villa . But Keith Millen, who was in temporary charge of the Eagles for the game, insisted that he had no involvement with the team ahead of the kick-off. ‘He had no input before the game or during,’ said Millen. ‘He came down after, shook everyone’s hands and was pleased and proud of what he’d seen. But we need to add goals to stay up. ‘He knows we need a different dimension. I’m sure he will have talked to the chairman about transfers. We know we need to bring in players.’ Pardew's first match in charge of Palace will be the FA Cup clash away at Dover Athletic on Sunday.","Alan Pardew set to become Crystal Palace boss on Friday afternoon .

"A London-based designer has come up with a collection of zombie-proof vehicles, just in time for Halloween. Donal O'Keeffe from Cork in Ireland, created the Zombie Survival Series with 3D rendering after being inspired by his love of horror films. The 31-year-old put the collection together after imagining what city-life would be like if the streets were taken over by wandering undead, from which there would be no safer escape than one of these modified, mobile fortresses. Graphic designer Donal O'Keeffe was inspired to create the collection with 3D Rendering by his love of horror films and fascination with how they 'put people out of their comfort zone' A typical London bus is kitted out with survival equipment including barrels for water and canned foods in the collection which imagines survival in a post-apocalyptic world . 'The concept for the series sprouted from my love of detailed 3D cross section renders,' said O'Keeffe, who works predominantly within broadcast. 'Their inherit ability to infuse narrative through the placement of . details. 'I really wanted the viewer to study and create for themselves, . to theorise about whom the survivor or survivors are and what kind of . background they came from.' 'I paired this interest with my love of horror films and their ability to place people outside their comfort zones.' 'I felt the concept of an end of civilization/zombie attack would be . an ideal way to explain these bizarre and abnormal creations.' His designs range from a London taxi to a Royal Mail van stuffed with survival foods including potatoes and baked beans. Speaking to core77.com, the designer said: 'Each one was rendered and created for large format printing. 'Plus I . felt the concept of protection from the outside world and our attempt to . cling onto some form of reality was fascinating. A Royal Mail van is converted into an apocalyptic survival zone complete with a bookshelf, ladder and fire extinguisher in O'Keeffe's collection of rendered images . A small American flag droops at the front of this battered New York taxi which seems to have lost its doors and windows amidst the zombie-populated city . An Indian tuk-tuk is kitted out with stationary machine guns and a bow-and arrow. Flood lights are positioned at the top of the vehicle to locate unwanted passengers . The graphic designer from Cork, Ireland, said he was inspired by his love of 3D rendering as well as his passion for films such as Zombieland, starring Jesse Eisenberg . 'These themes lead me to the zombie survival vehicles.' Alongside basic necessities like water and food are more personalised items imagined by O'Keeffe with individual characters in mind. Photographs, books and rosary beads are among weapons such as knives and rifles, as the driver tried to imagine people who 'live, drive and survive' in the modified vehicles. 'I also wanted to put some small detailed textures somewhere in the vehicles - blood stains, scrawled writings, pop culture designs etc,' he said. 'I've also had people interested in commissioning new pieces personal to them, such as modeling their father's car and filling it with his favorite possessions. Even modeling and designing whole buildings.' 'From the bookshelf on the upper storage space of the royal mail van to the American flag stuck in the grille of the yellow taxi.' All of the vehicles are equipped with a map at the driver's seat. In addition to fuel reserves they each have a weapon of choice ranging from pick-axes to machine guns. Prints of the images can be purchased online.","Zombie Survival Series conceptualizes post-apocalyptic world populated by zombies .

"A prolonged lack of exercise causes the body to become deconditioned . It is common knowledge that a sedentary lifestyle can lead to obesity, which is a common cause of diabetes, high blood pressure and joint damage. However, experts now want to treat lack of exercise as a medical condition in its own right. Dr Michael Joyner, from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, made the case in the latest edition of The Journal of Physiology. He said those who failed to work out . for months such as office workers tied to their desks were damaging . their health, whether they were overweight or not. Prolonged . lack of exercise causes the body to become deconditioned causing . changes throughout the body. The heart rate may rise excessively during . physical activity, bones and muscles can waste, blood volume can decline . and stamina wane. When . deconditioned people try to exercise, they may tire quickly and . experience dizziness or other discomfort, which makes many give up. Dr Joyner said: 'I would argue that physical inactivity is the root cause of many of the common problems that we have. 'If we were to medicalise it, we could then develop a way, just like we've done for addiction, cigarettes and other things, to give people treatments, and lifelong treatments, that focus on behavioral modifications and physical activity. 'Then we can take public health measures, like we did for smoking, drunken driving and other things, to limit physical inactivity and promote physical activity.' Several chronic medical conditions are associated with poor capacity to exercise, including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome better known as POTS, a syndrome marked by an excessive heart rate and flu-like symptoms when standing or a given level of exercise. Change of mindset: Dr Joyner said medics were too quick to prescribe medication rather than exercise . Too often, medication rather than progressive exercise is prescribed, Dr. Joyner said. He noted that a study from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center found that three months of exercise training can reverse or improve many POTS symptoms. Dr Joyner said if physical inactivity were treated as a medical condition itself rather than simply a cause or byproduct of other illnesses, doctors may become more aware of the value of prescribing supported exercise. He added that more formal rehabilitation programs that include cognitive and behavioral therapy would develop. For those who have been sedentary and are trying to get into exercise, Dr. Joyner advises doing it slowly and progressively. 'You just don't jump right back into it and try to train for a marathon,' he said. 'Start off with achievable goals and do it in small bites.' He added that a brisk walk of just 10 minutes three times a day would be a good way of reaching 3hr 30mins of moderate exercise a week.","More doctors would prescribe supported progressive exercise if inactivity was treated as a medical condition, says Mayo Clinic expert ."
"Legal experts have said SNP plans to charge British students university fees after independence could be in breach of the law . Charging British students up to £9000 in tuition fees if they attend Scottish universities after independence would be illegal, experts in EU law have ruled. The SNP-led Scottish Government has said that English, Welsh and Northern Irish students would continue to pay fees following a yes vote in September’s referendum, even though Scottish students and those from other EU countries outside of the UK would continue to be entitled to free tuition. But two legal experts say that the controversial charging regime flouts EU laws because it would be discriminatory. Niamh Nic Shuibhne (CORR), professor of European Union Law at Edinburgh University, said the Scottish Government would face ‘an extremely steep uphill battle’ to convince the EU its plans were legal. And Paul Beaumont, professor of European Law at Aberdeen University, branded the move as ‘overt discrimination’ against students from the rest of the UK – and said it is ‘hard to see’ how it can be justified. Their verdicts are contained within a new report due to be published tomorrow (MON) by a collection of academics who have set up an offshoot of the pro-Union Better Together campaign. It is a blow to the SNP, as it is estimated that giving free education to students from the rest of the UK would cost an extra £150 million – blowing a substantial hole in the nationalists’ education budgets. Professor Susan Shaw, former vice-principal of Strathclyde University and a member of the ‘Academics Together’ group, said:  ‘All the evidence points to the fact that Alex Salmond’s assertions on tuition fees don’t stand up to scrutiny. ‘The Scottish Government should publish any legal advice on charging students in the rest of the UK tuition fees if we go it alone, if any such advice even exists. ‘There is a real risk that the loss of funding from students in the rest of the UK would have negative consequences on our ability to teach Scotland’s students. 'The great irony of this issue is that the only way for the Scottish Government to guarantee its policy on tuition fees stays in place is for Scotland to remain in the UK. ‘Independence is a gamble we don’t need to take. As part of the UK we have the best of both worlds: we have a strong Scottish Parliament taking important decisions about our universities and colleges - and we can benefit from being part of the larger UK research system and the disproportionate share of UK research funding we receive. Under the current funding system, EU and Scottish students are entitled to ‘free’ higher education in Scotland while English, Welsh and Northern Irish youngsters pay up to £9,000 a year. Experts say Scotland would have to treat the rest of the UK like all other European countries following independence . The SNP Government’s white paper on independence states that ‘the Scottish Government proposes to maintain the status quo by continuing our current policy of charging fees to students from the rest of the UK to study at Scottish higher education institutions’. The new Academics Together report states that the proposals would ‘run into significant problems with European law’. It goes on: ‘If Scotland leaves the UK and joins the EU as a separate state, the rest of the UK will become like any other European Union country. ‘As a result, Scotland will be legally obliged to provide university education free to students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland.’ However, higher education body Universities Scotland has said that its own legal advice suggests it ‘would be possible’ to continue the policy. A spokesman for SNP Education Secretary Mike Russell said: ‘The White Paper is consistent with, and informed by, legal advice the Government has received. ‘The content of any legal advice is confidential.  By long standing convention, successive Scottish and Westminster governments have not disclosed the source or content of legal advice other than in the most exceptional circumstances. ‘There is however, very clear legal opinion already published by the universities themselves on this issue. It makes clear the possibility of continuing the current system within EU law. ‘It is entirely legitimate, of course, for people to express other views and that is a debate we welcome. What is a nonsense is for the no Camp to ignore the substantial and credible advice provided to Universities Scotland – a body of impeccable neutrality on the question of independence.’","SNP to charge English, Welsh and Northern Irish students after yes vote .

"Repeat criminals convicted of a second serious offence will face a mandatory life sentence, under new ‘two-strikes’ rules. Life terms will automatically go to anyone twice given jail terms of ten years or more for crimes such as rape, child abuse, serious GBH and terrorism offences. They will also apply to the crime of ‘causing or allowing the death of a child’ - the offence for which Baby Peter’s mother and boyfriend were jailed. Life terms will apply to the crime of 'causing or allowing the death of a child' the offence which Baby P's mother Tracey Connelly and Steven Barker were jailed . The sentences will replace Indeterminate Sentences for Public Protection (IPPs) which saw dozens of criminals locked up indefinitely without any prospect of parole. As the plans were revealed last night, it emerged Justice Secretary Ken Clarke had suffered a major defeat in his opposition to mandatory jail terms for 16 and 17 year-olds caught wielding a knife. Justice Secretary Ken Clarke suffered a major defeat in his opposition to mandatory jail terms for 16 and 17 year-olds caught wielding a knife . Just 24 hours earlier Mr Clarke had made clear his opposition to such a move. On Tuesday he told the Home Affairs Select Committee compulsory jail terms for young offenders were ‘a bit of a leap’ for the British judicial system. But Mr Clarke faced pressure from his Cabinet colleagues, including Home Secretary Theresa May, to accept tougher terms. On Tuesday he told MPs: ‘The idea that mandatory sentences now apply to certain types of offence, to young offenders, to children, to juveniles, is a bit of a leap for the British judicial system.’ But last night he said the term was necessary to ‘send out a clear message about the seriousness of juvenile knife crime’. The knife sentences apply to any offenders who are convicted of the new offence of ‘aggravated’ knife carrying - when they used the blade to threaten or endanger life. Anyone aged 16 or 17 would face a four-month detention and training order. The Government has already announced proposals for a mandatory six-month sentence for adults convicted of the same offence. As well as mandatory life, Mr Clarke also announced a new ‘Extended Determinate Sentence’ that will see serious offenders required to serve at least two-thirds of their term. Currently they are released automatically at the half-way point. Life terms will automatically go to anyone twice given jail terms of ten years or more for crimes such as rape, child abuse, serious GBH and terrorism offences . It will apply to serious sex and violent crimes and jailed for four years or more. After they have served two-thirds, they will only be released when the Parole Board says they are safe to go back on the streets. Justice Secretary Ken Clarke said: ‘Under our plans we expect more dangerous offenders to receive life sentences. ‘Those getting the new Extended Determinate Sentence will have to serve at least two-thirds of it behind bars before release. ‘We are clear that there will be no automatic release before the end of the full sentence for the most serious cases.’","Justice Secretary Ken Clarke suffers major defeat in his opposition to mandatory jail terms for 16 and 17 year-olds caught wielding a knife .

"Women should embrace numerous sexual partners instead of channeling their energy into finding 'the one', a new book advises. A sex coach trained in midwifey, Lauren Brim, 31, grew up in a Christian family in Orange County, California, which taught sex is sacred in marriage. It is global a social construct, she says, built to wound women sexually. Now, with eight partners on the go and quite a few under her belt, LA-based Brim insists she has been enlightened. Scroll down for video . Enlightened: Lauren Brim says women are wounded sexually by looking for 'the one' instead of enjoying sex . 'Sex is really energising. What’s tiring is dating,' she told The Telegraph. 'Women are so insistent on partnership and marriage because culture gives them no other format for sustained and socially approved sexuality and love.' In her recently-released book, The New Rules Of Sex, Brim describes her colorful catalogue of sexual experiences - sex with exes, with women, with numerous people at once, in all manner of unusual locations. And she reveals midwifery led her to a sexual awakening. 'I was watching women giving birth,' she explains in a YouTube promotion, 'and I was seeing that women who were in touch with their sexuality had much easier birth experiences - sometimes orgasmic birth experiences; empowering experiences. 'Enjoy yourself': The 31-year-old midwife (left) has written a book (right) encouraging more sex, less dating . Midwifery unlocked sex for me: She claims women who are in touch with their sexuality have easier births . 'Women who weren't in touch with their sexuality really struggled. They had a lot of interventions a lot of problems.' The realization provoked her to analyze the rules of sex in western society, she says. 'I was raised in a Christian family and was getting this message from my family, from society, from the church, that sexuality was really not ok; that it was something you could have with your husband when you got married. 'Later in my adult life I got more messages from society that it was ok to have sex but only with someone that you saw a potential relationship with; with someone that could potentially become your husband. 'That didnt feel great either. 'So I was suffering a lot with how to be sexual. I had this sexuality inside me and never felt like I could express it without getting in trouble for it.' When she turned 27, finding a relationship became near-impossible. 'I looked around and saw there were many single people around me, all of them attractive, talented and intelligent people,' she told The Telegraph. 'Some of them hadn’t been in a relationship for years.' 'I don’t believe in putting your energy into waiting for the perfect partner to come along. I believe in looking at what’s there.' 'Drop your expectations in men': Brim said she, like many , was confusing sex with potential relationships . Brim, a trained dancer who has performed with New York City's Radio City Rockettes, insists the book is not a How To guide - rather a reconfiguration of sexual rules. She says readers will be empowered to stop expecting love from sex, which should be celebrated in its own right. 'These expectations I had of my sexual partners - ""why didnt they love me?"" 'Sex and relationships and love were knotted up and I needed to unravel them. 'We need to set women free because women are really sexual and they're powerful. Her message to the female population? 'Relate to people differently, have less expectations [for your relationships].'","Lauren Brim, 31, said she was wounded sexually by marriage expectations .

"There is a well-worn saying that footballers should always play the game, not the occasion. Given that Sunday's eagerly-anticipated Old Firm clash will be the first for many of those on the pitch, that adage seems particularly poignant. Derby debutants could do a lot worse than talk to David Robertson. The Ibrox legend was no stranger to high-pressure semi-finals before arriving at Ibrox in 1991, having won the Scottish Cup and League Cup with Aberdeen. David Robertson (right) was sent off in his first game playing for Rangers against Celtic . Rangers boss Kenny McDowall poses with the Scottish League Cup ahead of the Old Firm clash with Celtic . Yet in his first Old Firm last-four encounter wearing the blue shirt of Rangers — a Scottish Cup showdown against Celtic at Hampden — he let the hype and hubris get the better of him. Then a 23-year-old left-back, Robertson's afternoon lasted just six minutes after he was shown a straight red for a body-check on Bhoys winger Joe Miller. 'I lasted six minutes in the semi in 1992 and that's what I'm famous for now,' reflected Robertson, who was back at Hampden studying for his UEFA Pro Licence this week. 'It's the most nerve-racking game I ever had. 'After I was sent off, I went into the dressing room and I heard all of this thumping from people banging on the old wooden stairs. 'Wee Doddy (Rangers kit man George Souter) came running in and told me it was a goal and I was thinking: 'Oh no.' But it was Coisty (Ally McCoist) who had scored to put us 1-0 up and I went to watch the second half. 'Celtic did what they did in those days and pounded us to death. We managed to hang on and I was more relieved than anyone else. It was a great occasion but I still felt as though I had let everyone down.' Amongst the current Rangers camp, seven have experienced the derby against Celtic — but for the likes of Fraser Aird, Nicky Law and Jon Daly, Sunday's League Cup semi-final at Hampden will be their first taste. Nicky Law has never played for Rangers in an Old Firm derby against Celtic before . Robertson (right) — who won six league titles with Rangers during the nine-in-a-row era — warned that nothing can quite prepare a player for the intensity of the fixture. 'I've played in Rangers games against Aberdeen and for Aberdeen against Celtic, big games, but in my first Old Firm game you couldn't hear anyone,' he added. 'I was trying to give an instruction to Goughie (Richard Gough) and he couldn't hear me. You are almost on your own. 'My first game was at Parkhead. I'd go and take a throw-in and people are spitting on you and doing all sorts of stuff. Obviously, those days have changed a little bit. 'It's going to be a strange atmosphere there and, hopefully, the Rangers supporters forget about the turmoil that's going on and really get behind the team and make it a bit of a spectacle. 'They are the underdogs, probably for the first time in a long time in any game, but it's a good chance for the team and the players to try to prove people wrong,' added the now 46-year-old Robertson, currently a director of boys coaching at Sereno Soccer Club in Phoenix, Arizona. Robertson (right) wants Rangers to show their character against favourites Celtic on Sunday . 'Rangers will need to show their character. It's the first time the clubs have met since all of the problems and now they are on their way back up. 'Every cup tie they have played on that journey against Premiership opposition, they have been expected to win. So this is the first where there isn't any expectation because all of the pressure will be on Celtic. 'You never know what will happen in a cup semi-final. All of these guys will relish playing in this game and they will see what's at stake. It will give them an escape from all of the drama that's going on at the moment.'

"Celtc will have to break the £2million barrier in their quest to sign Stuart Armstrong after Dundee United rejected an approach worth in the region of £1.5m. Burnley have also seen an offer - thought to be less than the one on the table from Parkhead - snubbed by the Tannadice club. Turf Moor manager Sean Dyche insists they are ‘highly unlikely’ to up their bid for Armstrong, but Celtic will have to come back with an improved package if they are to land one of Ronny Deila’s key targets before Monday’s transfer deadline. Burnley have had a £1.5million bid rejected for Dundee United's 22-year-old midfielder Stuart Armstrong . Dundee United are holding out for £2.5m for Armstrong and have rejected a bid from Celtic too . United remain adamant they have no need to sell and are thought to be sticking to a £2.5m valuation for the 22-year-old midfielder, who is under contract until the summer of 2016. ‘Neither of these bids is anywhere close to our valuation,’ said a Tannadice spokesman. ‘Neither bid is nearly close enough to consider.’ United are already losing winger Gary Mackay-Steven to Parkhead on a pre-contract agreement, with the possibility Celtic could yet offer a fee for a quicker move in the current window. Celtic midfielder Beram Keyal has agreed a two-and-a-half year deal to move to Brighton & Hove Albion . Barring a dramatic development, Armstrong is set to play for Jackie McNamara’s side in Saturday’s League Cup semi-final against Aberdeen at Hampden. Dyche claimed Burnley didn’t view the Scotland Under-21 cap as a player ready to make an immediate and regular first-team impact. They could now renew their attempts to instead land Scotland midfielder Graham Dorrans, who may be available from West Brom for around £3m. ‘Different offers have been in for players,’ said Dyche. ‘We like to do things privately, others don’t. ‘But he (Armstrong) is more of a development player.

Elina Desaine, 20, has been named Britain's horniest student after entering a degrading online competition . 'Shag list': Elina doesn't know how many people she has slept with or even the names of some of her sexual partners . Latvian-born Elina who refers to herself as a 'Slutvian' and 'Sexeter', said winning the contest has made her 'even hornier'. The former pupil of the £4,000-a-term James Allens Girls' School said one of her proudest moments is having sex in a university computer room, and admitted her ultimate goal is to seduce a lecturer. Despite being begged by her housemates to take tests for sexually transmitted illnesses, the student claims she is 'just having fun'. 'All my friends are the same - we are all just up for having a great time and going out. 'Uni life is three years to be wild before it starts settling down and it really flies by.' The third year IT management student keeps a list of her sexual partners or, in her words, 'conquests' but struggles to remember all their names. 'I have to put descriptions or question marks instead of names.' The self-proclaimed 'modern-day feminist' entered the competition after being encouraged by a friend who said she had a 'reputation for having fun'. 'My friends were worried about what future employers might say but I hope they see it as a bit of fun, and it shows I am more confident than the average girl.' Entrants were encouraged to post pleas to win the title on the 'casual dating' website's Facebook page. Elina, who was just one of hundreds of male and female candidates, wrote: 'I should be the UK's horniest student because I have sex with at least 2/3 different people a week. The student listed having sex in a computer room and sleeping with two university union bartenders as some of her biggest achievements . 'Sometimes I go clubbing, have sex with someone, and then go back to the club to pick my second victim'. ‘I should be the UK’s horniest student because I have sex with at least 2 / 3 different people a week. 'Sometimes I go clubbing, have sex with someone, and then go back to the club to pick up my second victim. 'Feeling horny right now, so might just text someone on my ‘shag list’ and do it in the computer room (I’ve done this before, was great!) 'With your help of Alcohol (sic) I will be able to become an even Hornier Student!’ 'Feeling . horny right now, so might just text someone on my ‘shag list’ and do it . in the computer room (I’ve done this before, was great). With your help . of alcohol (sic) I will be able to become an even hornier student!' The website's creator, Tom Thurlow, said: 'As soon as I saw Elina’s entry I knew we had a particularly . wild girl on our hands.' 'I love the fact she uses her position . in the computer science club to have sex in the computer room. 'She even . told me how the computer science club is perfect because it’s full of . guys. 'After meeting with Elina personally I . am 100 per cent confident I have found the horniest student in the . country - I have never met someone so sexually confident.' The student, pictured here with other naked students, hopes her actions will not affect future employers' decisions and that they will 'see it as a bit of fun' The competition was slammed by sexual health experts as 'dangerous' though Shagatuni.com encourages students to have safe sex . The student, who claims to have had sex with just two people before going to university, claimed some of her proudest moments were sleeping with two of the university union's bartenders and stripping to the Baywatch theme song while in a local nightclub. The final year student is planning on applying for internships in the hope to start up her own technology business. A spokesman for The University of Exeter told Mail Online: 'We certainly don’t condone this sort of behaviour but our main concern at this time is for the student and the impact this may have on her over the long term.'

Though the University chose not to respond to Miss Desaine's claim to have had sex in an on-campus computer room, their regulations relating to the use of technology facilities states: 'Personal or recreational use of the IT facilities may be subject to temporary or permanent suspension'. She insists her only rule is to only have sex when using a condom, and claims a recent chlamydia test that her housemates forced her to take returned a negative result. 'It's great because you can have fun without getting any diseases'. Sexual health experts condemned the competition as 'dangerous' as they believed it could encourage the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Before the competition's winner was announced, sexual health consultant Dr Peter Greenhouse said: ‘The more people who try to win this award, the more dangerous things will be for their friends. It is far from a brilliant idea in public health terms. 'Most people who have sexual infections have no symptoms. They get these infections from people who don't know they have it. That is why there are so many infections around.’","Elina Desaine does not know how many people she has had sex with .
