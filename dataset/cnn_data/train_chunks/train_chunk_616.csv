At first glance they might be mistaken for a standard pair of cream trainers — the sort you’d find in any sports shop on the High Street. But the truth is there’s nothing standard about this pair of shoes specially commissioned for pop star Beyonce. Made from a combination of crocodile, anaconda, stingray and ostrich skin, as well as calfskin, it’s little wonder that everyone from animal rights groups to the singer’s fans has branded her ‘cruel’ and ‘spoilt’ for making such a tacky and exploitative fashion statement. Beyonce’s trainers are based on a wedge-style shoe by designer Isabel Marant, but have been given a bling makeover by American company Perfectly Made Kicks (PMK). Unique: The handcrafted sneakers are custom-made for Beyonce using a mix of stingray, ostrich, calf's fur, crocodile and anaconda skins . The company, which states that their exotic skins come from a legal supplier in New York, previously customised a pair of trainers for Beyonce’s rapper husband, Jay Z, that were covered in calf, ostrich, python, boa constrictor, crocodile, lizard, alligator and stingray skins, as well as patches of imitation elephant skin. PMK boss Andre Scott says: ‘It’s legal. I don’t think animal rights campaigners like it very much, but it’s legal.’ Legal or not, animal lovers are outraged that Beyonce has followed in her husband’s footsteps. PMK . insists ‘no animals were beaten, harmed or killed in the development . and crafting of the sneakers’ — though it remains slightly unclear how . you make a shoe out of any kind of leather without killing animals. Expensive taste: Beyonce often wear these £62,000 gold-plated Balenciaga leggings on stage . The pressure group PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) is in no doubt: ‘These custom-made [trainers] come with a high price — and it’s paid by the various animals who were beaten and skinned alive or cruelly farmed and killed.’ Here, the Mail reveals how these exotic creatures suffer — in the name of high fashion. ANACONDA . With its interlocking scales, the skin used for the detailing over the heel and toe of Beyonce’s trainers is immediately identifiable as snake. Anacondas, like crocodiles, are subject to controls by the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES), but the trade is so poorly regulated that it is difficult to establish the source of the skins. For every animal that goes through the system legally, it is estimated that another will be smuggled. Excessive hunting of the snakes — . which are found in South America and can grow to a length of 20 ft — . poses a threat to the viability of the species in the long-term. There . are also widespread concerns about the barbaric ways in which snakes . captured in the wild are killed. As . skins are valued at £23 a foot (designer Tom Ford sells his . over-the-knee anaconda boots for £2,000), great care is taken to ensure . it is removed undamaged from the snake. The creature will often first be . stunned with a blow to the head, rather than killed outright. In . order to loosen the skin, a hose pipe is inserted into its jaws and the . snake filled up with water, swelling the reptile up like a balloon. It . will be left like that for ten minutes or so, a leather cord tied around . its neck to prevent the liquid escaping. Then . its head is impaled on a meat hook, a couple of quick incisions follow, . and the loosened skin is peeled off with a series of brutal tugs — much . like a rubber glove being removed from a hand. From . there, the skin will be sent to a tannery before being turned into . luxury shoes or handbags. Because of the snake’s slow metabolic rate it . can survive, skinned alive, for hours or even days until succumbing to . the effects of dehydration or shock. OSTRICH . The ostrich skin that forms the tongue of Beyonce’s shoe is one of the strongest commercial leathers and bears the distinctive pattern of bumps made by the quill follicles of the bird’s feathers. While ostriches were originally farmed in South Africa for their feathers and meat, their leather became popular in the U.S. during the Seventies when it was used for cowboy boots. Since then it has become a firm fashion favourite — the hides fetch more than £320 each. British bag designer Mulberry sells ostrich leather totes for up to £4,500, while the classic Louis Vuitton Keepall 50 bag in ostrich skin costs £7,000. Skinned: The team behind the sneakers used ostrich skin for the tongue of the shoes and Anaconda for the heel and toes detailing to please Beyonce . Critics of ostrich farming point out that in the wild the birds have well-developed courtship, nest-building and chick-rearing behaviours, and live to 50 or more. Farmed, they are penned up, their eggs taken away from them and their chicks killed at little more than a year old. Wild ostriches can run at up to 40mph and will cover 15 to 20 miles a day in their natural habitat, but farmed ostriches are often confined to an acre or less of land. As a result, they are prone to painful leg deformities and suffer from other diseases, such as avian flu. Animal rights campaigners have also highlighted the stress ostriches endure during slaughter. The bird’s legs are tied together and a water-soaked hood placed over its head. It is then electrocuted, hoisted upside down and its throat cut as it bleeds to death. CROCODILE . Farmed around the world, crocodile skin is so popular that 1.3 million of the reptiles are slaughtered to meet demand each year. Beyonce has a four-inch strip of crocodile skin on the back of her trainers. Crocodiles are favoured by shoe and bag designers. A grey crocodile Hermes Birkin costing £79,000 is one of many such bags owned by the socialite Tamara Ecclestone. The majority of crocodiles killed for their skin are bred and reared on farms. But every year more than 90,000 are also killed in the wild. Fierce fang: Beoynce's sneakers have a four-inch strip of crocodile hide on the back . A further 225,000 are ‘ranched’. This is where they are monitored in their natural environments and then brought on to farms for slaughter. Animal rights campaigners say the crowded pens in which the reptiles are kept cause great stress. They are unable to swim away to quiet areas, as they would in the wild. There is no mud for them to lie in or grass to hide in. Their natural instincts to hunt are denied and they develop abnormalities and deformities because they can’t walk or swim. After just three years, their short lives come to a brutal end — the usual method of killing will be a bullet. The crocodiles are grabbed by workers and their snouts bound before being dispatched with a rifle. A direct shot to the brain, which is encased in a 2cm-thick skull, is far from guaranteed. While this might seem a callous end to a short life for an animal that would live for 70 years or more in the wild, it is more humane than the method used on some farms. According to PETA, the reptile can be killed by hammering a chisel between the base of the skull and the first vertebrae, a procedure which can take between five and eight blows to achieve. They are then skinned, often while still alive. Like snakes, because of their slow metabolisms they can survive, in agony, for up to two hours after they have been completely skinned. Only certain bits of the skin will be considered good enough to use, which means it can take up to four crocodiles to make one bag. As a result of the intensive hunting of wild crocodiles, they are supposedly protected under the CITES agreement. Raw hide: Stingray skin is 25 times more durable than cow hide and is worth £63 per square foot . STINGRAY . Famed for being 25 times more durable than cowhide, stingray leather — often referred to as shagreen — is used on the three fastenings on Beyonce’s trainers. Traditionally, the rays, which are closely related to sharks, would have been killed for food, the skins a by- product used for the grips of Chinese and Japanese swords. In recent years, the leather has become a popular material in the world of high fashion — Alexander Wang’s stingray purses sell for £800. Because the skins are relatively small, they tend to be used for purses and wallets rather than bags. The skin is worth £63 per square foot. While the fish are common in coastal tropical and subtropical marine waters, their populations are increasingly under threat. Five species of stingray are listed as ‘endangered’ and there is a worrying lack of data about the population levels of many others. It is estimated that in Indonesia alone, two million rays are caught each year, with some boats bringing in up to 30 metric tons of stingrays per trip. Because stingrays reach maturity relatively late and produce relatively few offspring, there is concern that over-fishing could cause populations to collapse. Last year, in response to this threat, Panama banned fishing for stingrays in its territorial waters. Scientists have warned that unless steps are taken on an international level to significantly reduce the catch of these animals, they are at risk of disappearing.","Singer Beyonce has bought specially made trainers of exotic animal skin .

Sibling arguments are often dismissed as part of growing up, but a new study suggests that fights between brothers and sisters could be linked to mental health problems. Researchers looked at the cases of 3,599 children aged between one month and 17 years old including the effects of physical attacks, stealing or breaking a sibling's toys and psychological aggression. Almost a third of the children studied reported at least one such incident and researchers found that those aged between one month and nine years old felt the most distress after being physically attacked than older children. Problematic: Fighting between siblings could lead to mental health problems in later life according to new research (file picture) The resulting distress from other types of attack was the same across all ages. According to the study, which has been published in the medical journal Paediatrics, aggression between siblings could have the same bearing on mental health as bullying among peers. Mental scars: Fighting over or breaking each others toys as children can affect mental health . Corinna Jenkins Tucker, the lead researcher to compile the study at the University of New Hampshire in the US, said: 'Even kids who reported just one instance had more mental health distress. 'Our study shows that sibling aggression is not benign for children and adolescents, regardless of how severe or frequent.' She added that while some parents think that sibling fighting can even be beneficial to growing up it can have serious mental health implications. She said: 'If siblings hit each other, there's a much different reaction than if that happened between peers. The research team used data from The National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence to complete the study. Children were interviewed by phone about victimisation in the past year.

An Illinois non-profit is training miniature horses as therapy animals, and bringing them to nursing homes, schools, hospitals and veteran facilities where they provide comfort to disabled people or those who have suffered trauma. The adorable horses - the size of a golden retriever - are petted, brushed, hugged and loved by the people they visit and the interaction improves their physical, mental and emotional well-being. Comfort: Jodie Diegel, seated, founder of Mane in Heaven, approaches Lunar, the oldest mare of the group, in a wheelchair to desensitize the horse at Dynasty Farm in Lake in the Hills, Illinois . Visits: The horses visit nursing homes, schools, hospitals and veteran facilities to provide comfort and affection to those in need . Jodie Diegel founded Mane in Heaven with her four horses, called Lunar, Turnabout, Mystery and Jenella, and the animals wear tiny rubber-soled shoes made for stuffed toy bears when they go to work. 'It's the same reaction everybody has when they first see the animals,' she says. 'The first three words to come out of their mouths are, ""Oh my gosh!""' The size of the horses is unexpected, and the fact that they are wearing sneakers and a halter with their name written in crystal ""bling"" across the nose always gets a reaction. 'Aside from looking very cute, they actually provide a functional purpose,' Diegel explains about the little round shoes. Cute: Jodie Diegel, left, and her horses relax with the volunteers for her Mane In Heaven pet therapy organization at Dynasty Farm . Training: Jodie Diegel, left, trains Lara Budmats, treasurer for Mane in Heaven, and Turnabout, a 2-year-old male miniature horse, to be calm around a wheelchair . 'When we go on a linoleum or tile floor at a facility, without something like the sole of a shoe, it would be very slippery for them.' Diegel, her four board members, and the three eldest miniature horses have all passed the evaluation process of Pet Partners, a national organization that determines whether animals and handlers are ready for visits to places such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools. 'We're founded with the mission to train them as therapy animals,' Diegel says, adding that miniature horses are now also being used as guides for vision-impaired persons. 'What's really exciting is to see my vision and my mission coming to life with these miniature horses.' Tame: Tim Scotellaro, of Crystal Lake, Illinois, walks with a miniature horse at the Mane in Heaven pet therapy organization . Sneakers: Jodie Diegel ties a small round sneaker, meant for a toy stuffed bear, onto the front hoof of Turnabout at Mane In Heaven . She and 43 committed volunteers meet every weekend at Dynasty Farm in Lake in the Hills, where the 'minis' are boarded. There, volunteers get to know the horses and to train to be handlers. Part of the training includes desensitizing the horses so they ignore the natural impulse to flee from danger, like that presented by a rolling wheelchair. The horses are taught to behave in a variety of settings. Diegel laughs and admits that sometimes it's easier to train the horses than the people. 'They are absolutely amazing little animals, she laughs. 'But I am totally amazed at the commitment and ability of our volunteers. It's a joy to watch the interaction.'","Illinois non profit Mane In Heaven's four horses visit nursing homes, schools, hospitals and veteran facilities .

With his penchant for 'hunny' and a philosophical outlook, Winnie-the-Pooh was the charming bear whose tales captivated children from the day they were first published nearly 90 years ago. But while the the bear of little brain is still popular with his young audience, a publisher has decided that perhaps his gentle stories are not fast-moving enough for today's youngsters. Today, Egmont Press releases a new app for iPad and iPhone - featuring a shorter, and speeded-up version of Pooh's adventures in the Hundred Acre Wood. The story of Winnie-the-Pooh has been abridged for a new app because today's children have shorter attention spans . The Classic Pooh app, which is read by actor Rufus Jones and is free to download, abridges AA Milne's story because the publisher says children will lose interest if the story does not zip along. Kristian Knak, who developed the story for Egmont, said today's young readers would move on if they were not grabbed in the first 60 seconds. 'Today's children's attention spans are slightly different to how they were in 1926,' he said. ‘We have a minute to get them on board.  If not, they will move on to the next app,' he told The Times. Egmont's Tim Jones said the stories had to be made more appealing to a modern audience to keep them relevant to today's children. ‘As a children’s publisher, we want to be where children are experiencing entertainment and that is in the digital format,’ he Metro. The Classic Pooh app will feature animated versions of the original drawings by the late Ernest Shepard . ‘We’ve been working with illustrations that are 85 years old which have a place in British culture, illustrations that are greatly loved. We had to look at it very sensitively and that’s what we’ve tried to do.’ A second story app is available to buy for £1.99, and further stories will be available later this year. This morning, popular children's author Giles Paley-Phillips, 35, said it was 'tragic' that such a gentle story had to be speeded up for modern children. The award-winning author of The Fearsome Beastie said: 'I've got two boys of my own, aged six and four, and we enjoy the bedtime ritual where we sit down and have time to read picture books and look at the illustrations. 'It is especially sad given that the Pooh stories are so soft and gentle, and have such lovely pictures. 'I am very against e-books, because I think everything in the modern world moves at such a frantic pace.  Reading a book at their own pace offers children a chance to slow down and use their imagination, and really enjoy the story.' The new Classic Pooh app, available from today, features animations of the original Winnie-the-Pooh drawings . New drawings show the bear and his friend Piglet enjoying the sights of London, including the Shard, pictured . The new drawings, by illustrator Mark Burgess, depict Pooh visiting London and playing Pooh sticks on the Millennium Bridge . The Pooh stories for the app are not new, but the publisher has released publicity images drawn by Mark Burgess in the style of original illustrator E. H. Shepard of Pooh bear and his friend Piglet in modern settings. There is one of Pooh taking a photograph of London skyscraper The Shard with his mobile phone, another showing the pair on the Millennium 'wobbly' Bridge, and another showing them getting off a Tube train. Winnie-the-Pooh, who was named after Milne's son Christopher Robin's stuffed teddy bear, lost his hyphens when Disney adapted his stories for the screen in the 1960s. The anthropomorphic bear and his friends have enchanted youngsters for decades, generating millions in the process. In 1930, American Stephen Slesinger bought the US and Canadian rights for Pooh from Milne for $1,000 and 66 per cent of Slesinger's income, and by the following year it was a $50m-a-year business. The stories about Pooh bear have been translated into many languages including Russian and even Latin, and have inspired films, television series, and a lucrative range of Pooh-related merchandise.","New Classic Pooh app for iPad offers faster-paced stories to grab children .

Controversial: German chancellor Angela Merkel has said unemployed youngsters in the Eurozone should be prepared to move for work . German chancellor Angela Merkel has risked incurring the wrath of struggling eurozone countries by saying unemployed youngsters should be prepared to move for work. Describing the current levels of unemployment across the eurozone as a 'huge crisis', Merkel said there would need to be more mobility among its workforce. Her comments come after recent figures showed unemployment had soared to a record high of close to 20million. The figures showed youth unemployment had surged to a devastating 24.4 per cent – meaning one . in four Europeans under the age of 25 who want work cannot find a job. Speaking to the BBC, Merkel said that when unemployment among young people in her own area of East . Germany had risen 'many young people... only had jobs because they . moved to the south'. She added: 'I think it's unfair that it is the young people especially who have to pay the bill for something they didn't do. 'But there's no way around it. We have to manufacture products or offer services in Europe that we can sell.' Her comments are likely to prove controversial in countries such as Spain and Greece which have previously criticised Merkel as they struggle against rising unemployment. During her interview, Merkel also maintained that the policy with trying to drag Europe out of the crisis was correct. She told how the issue is not austerity but how to get back to growth. She also . defended the policy of tight controls on spending. Speaking following the latest unemployment figures released last month, Anatoli Annenkov, senior European economist at French bank Societe Generale, said the worst-hit countries are at risk of a ‘lost generation’ who will never find work. It is feared that rocketing unemployment . – particularly among the young – will fuel resentment against the euro . and trigger a break-up of the single currency bloc. Worrying: Chancellor Merkel's comments come after recent figures showed unemployment had soared to a record high of close to 20million . The European Commission warned that unemployment across the region is ‘unacceptably high’ and threatens ‘grave social consequences’. French president Francois Hollande said it could lead to the breakdown of Europe. ‘Citizens are turning their backs on Europe and the construction of the European project,’ he said. German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said European ‘unity’ was at risk.

With proper treatment, the worst effects are nausea and drowsiness, followed by severe swelling and bruising in the area of the bite. Adders usually eat small rodents, such as the short-tailed vole. They will also eat lizards, frogs and newts, and have been seen taking young from the nests of ground nesting birds. When hunting, adders strike swiftly at the prey, injecting a lethal dose of venom, the Forestry Commission says. They then wait until the prey dies before starting the often lengthy swallowing process.","New mother was bitten by a snake as she walked through a paddock .

National Security Agency documents leaked by Edward Snowden reveal that both the American and British spied on delegates of other countries at two 2009 Group of 20 meetings. The report indicates that Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters, an organization analogous to the NSA, set up internet cafes at the 2009 London Group of 20 conference with the purpose of reading the emails of those attendees who used them, among other spy tactics. Also revealed were documents showing that the NSA was also actively monitoring London G20 attendees, specifically then Russian president Dmitry Medvedev. Flies on the wall: Leaked NSA docs show both British and American officials were actively spying on other dignitaries during 2009's London G8 summit . The report came out hours before leaders of the Group of Eight countries - all of which are in the G20 - start a two-day summit in Northern Ireland. The Guardian reports it had seen classified documents that detailed secret monitoring by British intelligence of officials at the April 2009 leaders summit and a finance ministers' meeting in September of that year and suggested it had been sanctioned at a senior level by the government of former prime minister Gordon Brown. The monitoring included tapped Blackberry correspondences, both email and voice. In its internet cafes, GCHQ reportedly placed keyloggers in the computers in order to gain ‘sustained intelligence options against them even after conference has finished.’ Which, reports New York Magazine, is a fancy way to say foreign officials’ login information could be used for GCHQ purposes in the future. Target: American spies, the report shows, targeted then Russian President Medvedev, right, intercepting his and his group members' calls . The surveillance and intelligence collection appeared to have been aimed at getting an edge in the meetings, against targets that included South Africa and Turkey, the report said. British intelligence sought to determine if Turkey’s positions, set at the April meeting, had since shifted by the September 2009 meeting. As calls made by the Turkish officials were monitored, British officials used the information gained as a means to ""influence events on the ground taking place just minutes or hours later."" As for the NSA, the report revealed the Americans monitored correspondences of President Medvedev and his cohorts at the April 2009 summit. The communications were reportedly intercepted through American spy hub Menwith Hill in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England where both American and British intelligence officials operate. Bugging out: Gordon Brown shaking hands with the former President of Brazil.

Locals in a small Pennsylvania town freed an elusive bear from a jar after it had been stuck on the young bruin's head for at least 11 days. Using only a rope and a flashlight, four central Pennsylvania residents removed the plastic jar from the bear's head on Thursday night after going on a wild chase in the dark, according to the Associated Press and the Press Enterprise of Bloomsburg. Area residents spotted the 100-pound brown bear—or bruin—on June 3 with a red jar on its head but game wardens failed to track him down. Rescuers said the bear was attracted to the jar because it seemed to once contain cooking oil. Stuck: A young bruin, or brown bear, got stuck in a jar in central Pennsylvania for at least 11 days. Here, a young grizzly walks on the shoulder of a road in Alaska . Rescuers: A member of the impromptu bear-wrangling team spotted the bear after leaving a bar at the Jamison City Hotel. One of the rescuers owns the bar and another works as a bartender there . 'He put his head in, and had a problem,' said Mike Jurbala, 68, one of the members of the spontaneous rescue team. 'He'd have died in a couple more days.' Jurbala saw the bear as he was leaving the bar at the Jamison City Hotel in Benton, Pa., and called Jeff Hubler, one of the game wardens who had been trying to capture the bear for several days with a lasso. Hubler, a local employee of the State Game Comission, joined Jurbala and two other residents in capturing the bear. Along with Morgan Laskowski, 22, the hotel's bartender, and Jody Boyle, the bar's owner, Hubler and Jurbala followed the bear in the darkness. 'You knew where he was because you could hear him banging into things,' Jurbala said. After the ragtag group cornered the bear in a backyard, the frightened bruin fell into the local resident's pool a couple of times, according to a report by the Press Enterprise. After a while, the four wrangled the bear into a position where Hubler could safely pull off the jar. 'I thought, ""No one is going to believe us,""' Laskowski said. Boyle, Laskowski's mother, added the bear was stronger than it looked: 'You'd think the bear would be weak, because it hadn't eaten or drunk for a week, but it was strong. Sticky situation: Bears like this immature wild grizzly at Polychrome Pass in Denali National Park, Alaska, commonly get stuck in jars and other human trash . This isn't the first time a bear has gotten in a sticky situation with a jar. A tiny bear cub in Alaska got its head stuck in a plastic jug in March 2012. A hiker used an ice ax to cut through a plastic container that likely would have killed the 10-pound bear he found on Deer Mountain in Ketchikan, Alaska, according to the Anchorage Daily News. 'His future was pretty said and done,' the hiker, Michael Schuler, said of the cub. 'He wasn't going to move. He probably would have lain there until he died.' In July 2010, a team with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission saved a six-month-old black bear cub in central Florida from a clear plastic container. The team had to tranquilize the cub's protective mother so they could save him, according to the New York Daily News. 'Although the story appears to have a happy ending,' the commission said of the incident. 'It truly illustrates one of the worst things that can happen when wildlife gets into garbage.' Hubler, the Central Pennsylvanian game warden, made a note of saying people should keep lids on jars they toss.","Four Pennsylvania residents wrangled the frightened young bear using only a rope and a flashlight .

The head of the gang bureau at Brooklyn's District Attorney has been fired after a series of alleged slurs, including calling a leading prosecutor 'the head n****r'. Deanna Rodriguez had been suspended in March, without pay, after referring to interns, paralegals and assistant district attorneys as 'faggots' and 'dykes'. The 52-year-old allegedly sent an email to a female colleague containing physical threats and homophobic slurs. An investigation into the behavior of Ms Rodriguez, who earned about $160,000 a year, revealed she had also used racist slurs. She was fired by Brooklyn district attorney Charles 'Joe' Hynes on Friday. 'After complete review of her conduct, she was terminated effective immediately,' Jerry Schmetterer, spokesman for the district attorney's office, told the New York Post. Former colleagues praised Ms Rodriguez's leadership in the department, which she had run since 1996. However, others said she had a volatile reputation, adding 'She's a wild woman. She's nuts.' Several complaints had been made about Ms Rodriguez by employees, including one with the federal . Equal Employment Opportunity, the New York Post was told. 'When this issue first arose, Deanna . Rodriguez was immediately suspended for 90 days without pay,' Mr Schmetterer told the Daily News. While she was suspended, an internal investigation found she had referred to an African-American employee, believed to be counsel to the district attorney, Lance Ogiste, as 'the head n****r'.

Ms Rodriguez refused to comment on whether she believed she had been wrongly fired, and whether she would dispute the firing. 'This is about vilifying me,' she said. 'It’s not the right story. I’m not prepared to talk.' The acting head of the Gang Bureau is now Executive Assistant District Attorney Edward Carroll.

If your enjoyment of a good Shiraz or Chardonnay has ever been delayed by having to hunt through the kitchen drawers for a corkscrew, help is at hand. A new invention combines the tradition of a cork stopper with the convenience of a screw cap, meaning summer picnics and romantic dinners could be just a little bit simpler from now on. The Helix is an old-fashioned cork stopper – but it has a screw thread that drinkers can twist in and out of the neck of the bottle. It comes with a bottle which has a matching thread, so it can be tightly resealed to keep the contents fresh. The innovative design is the result of a joint effort by Amorim, the world’s largest wine cork manufacturer, and O-I, the biggest global maker of glass containers. They are optimistic that it could be seen on shelves soon. The companies claim wine stored in the Helix tastes no different to a classic bottle – and important markers used by critics to judge wine, such as colour and smell, are also unaffected. They say wine from the bottles has gone down well with tasters in the UK, US, Australia and China. A spokesman said: ‘It offers  all of the ease of opening – and  closing – that screw caps offer, but with totally natural eco-friendly materials. It also has the maturing benefits that natural cork brings  to wine.’ She added: ‘It can be quickly and easily implemented by wineries with only a minor adjustment to the existing filling lines.’ Unlike other devices designed to keep wine fresh once it has been opened, the Helix cork can also be used for champagne, resealing it so well that a partially empty bottle will still produce a satisfying pop when it is opened. Fresh and fine: The cork and bottle have a thread finish to allow drinkers to twist the stopper open and closed again, creating an airtight barrier . Antonio Amorim, chairman of Amorim, said: ‘Helix meets consumers’ growing desire for sustainability and quality. ‘We are delighted to offer not  only a 100 per cent renewable,  modern product, but also a solution that enhances the wine drinking experience.’ His family firm is more than 140 years old and supplies traditional corks to 82 countries. Based in Portugal, it makes use of the country’s huge areas of cork oak forest. In recent years, manufacturers have increasingly turned to cheap and easy-to-use screw caps, particularly for lower priced wines. But if the Helix proves successful, it could make a traditional cork – which some experts say improves the wine’s flavour – just as convenient as a metal cap.","New twisty cork and bottle to keep wine fresh to hit markets .

These curious living trees have fused together into bizarre contortions both by accident and design. Thanks to bean farmer Axel Erlandson from California, who pioneered the art of weaving and pruning trees together, we have the basket-shaped and arch-shaped trees from his collection of 'circus trees'. The rest occur naturally in a phenomenon known as inosculation, when one tree bonds to another. Axel Erlandson sculpted this single tree into an arch design in a secret method that had not yet been replicated . The Basket Tree, one of Erlandson's rare circus trees, was woven together from six separate sycamore trees . Taking many years to gently shape, graft and prune the trees, Erlandson created the odd trees, starting with his 'Four Legged Giant' creation - four trees which he grew into a single truck creating a gazebo effect in the middle. The basket effect tree required 42 separate connections between six sycamore trees in a secret configuration that no one else has yet been able to replicate. Erlandson started off the sculptures as a way to entertain his family but by the time of his death, he had a collection of 74 of these circus trees. He was inspired by nature as he noticed the elegance of trees weaving together on his farm. Some trees are capable of creating unintentional art without any help from horticulturalists . Of the planet's 400 odd billion trees, these are some of the most unusual and exotic . They may look surreal but these trees are living and natural . The trees were bought by millionaire . Michael Bonfante, who transplanted them from the Santa Cruz mountains to . his amusement park Gillroy Gardens in 1985, where they are still on . display. Other quirky examples of tree sculpture occur naturally as trunks contort due to extreme weather conditions or to fit round obstacles. Given time trees can grow around just about anything, as seen in ruins around the world such as Angkor Wat, where trees have pushed through the foundations of the buildings.","Trees can bond together in a phenomenon known as inosculation .

New York City is not known as a camping destination, but one artist is trying to bring the classic summer pastime to the urban jungle. Brooklyn-based artist Thomas Stevenson is hosting free temporary rooftop encampments as part of 'Bivouac New York', giving guests the opportunity to spend a night under the stars on an undisclosed New York City rooftop and get away from the hustle and bustle of modern life. 'I think New York City—and Michael Bloomberg's going to kill me—is a playground,' Stevenson told The Village Voice. 'I look at space utilization in New York City and see how we're all trapped indoors. There's plenty of outdoor space, but it's just not public. And then the question becomes, ""what is public and what is private?""' Under the stars: Bivouac New York, a temporary rooftop encampment, lets guests camp in the city 'wilderness' Artist: The project is organized by Brooklyn-based artist Thomas Stevenson . Communal: Campers are given coffee and access to a toilet at the temporary campsite . Dining: Guests are asked to bring a protein, starch or vegetable to share in a communal dinner . As part of Stevenson's exploration of this relationship, campers sign up for a spot in one of seven bivouacs, or temporary shelters, for one night in July and August. Guests won't know where they're camping until the day before, when they'll get an email and text notification. Stevenson tells the Voice guests must put down a refundable $200 deposit to ensure everyone who signs up, shows up. While guests can sign up with people they know, Stevenson said meeting strangers is one of the major parts of the project. 'I often don't know anybody,' Stevenson said. 'That's the wonderful part of making participatory art—I don't know what will happen.' Tents: Participants have to bring their own sleeping materials, but tents have a 1-inch wool felt floor . Exploration: Artist Thomas Stevenson is using the project to explore public and private space in the city . Disconnect: Bivouac campers like Anne-Cecile Genne don't have access to the Internet or electricity . The camp's amenities include a family-sized canteen with a picnic table for communal dining. 'Guests are encouraged to live their normal daily lives. They will leave the site each morning, take the subway and conduct their working hours as usual,' the project's website explains. 'Their domestic hours will be spent on the roof, in the great city outdoors, roughing it.' The canvas tents have enough room for two or three campers and have a 1-inch wool felt floor. Campers have to bring sleeping materials, including pillows and blankets, and one item—either a protein, starch or vegetable—for the communal dinner. Campers can use a small library in the canteen, but there is no electricity, Internet or shower. Rooftop: Participants don't know where they'll be camping until the day before . Shelter: The project has seven bivouacs, or temporary shelters, available for participants . Views: The undisclosed rooftops are usually in Bushwick or Williamsburg to get the best views of Manhattan . 'It is all about the experience of disconnecting and meeting,' the Bivouac NYC website reads. Like the traditional campsites, the website notes 'this wilderness has an assortment of opinionated neighbors (new yorkers). please be respectful and try to blend in with your surroundings'. The rooftops will likely be in Bushwick or Williamsburg, Brooklyn, so as to give participants a good view of Manhattan, but Stevenson tells the Voice he wants to do one Bivouac in Midtown. Stevenson said he's played an organizing role at 30 such events in the last 20 months. In August or September, the project will even come to London. The project will be held in New York City from July 12 to 15. For more information or to sign up, visit BivouacNYC.com. Setting up: Campers are given tool kits .

Quizzed: Senior Liberal Democrat peer Lord Rennard has been interviewed by police under caution over allegations he sexually harassed women party activists . Liberal Democrat peer Lord Rennard was questioned by police yesterday over a ‘torrent’ of claims that he harassed and indecently assaulted women. The party’s chief executive was questioned under caution for several hours over allegations he molested young activists. The claims surfaced in February when it emerged that a number of woman activists and party workers had complained of unwanted advances by Lord Rennard, who presided over ‘training’ weekends attended by hundreds of female party hopefuls. Some claimed he tried to entice them to his bedroom. One threatened to blow the whistle at a tribunal before she was paid off. Others said they were left ‘shamed and humiliated’. His solicitors said in a statement: 'We can confirm that Lord Rennard agreed to meet with the police and that he welcomed his first opportunity to refute the basis of allegations made against him.' The allegations, which surfaced on . Channel 4 in February, came from Miss Smith, Bridget Harris, a former . special adviser to Nick Clegg, and two unnamed women. Mr Clegg said the report made . ‘sobering reading’ and said there was ‘no excuse’ for what had happened . over 20 years in the party’s corridors of power. Others say they were left ‘shamed and humiliated’ during his alleged campaign of sexual harassment. One alleged he put his hands where . they had ‘no business being’ and another branded him ‘repugnant’ for . allegedly forcing his hand up her dress as they posed for a photo. Lord Rennard has said he was ‘deeply shocked’ by the allegations and described them as  a ‘total distortion’ of his character. But last week Nick Clegg admitted he failed to respond vigorously enough to a series of sexual . harassment complaints about his party’s former chief executive. A formal inquiry was triggered by the . allegations surrounding Lord Rennard, pictured (left) after a meeting in . Bangkok in 2010 and (right) at this year’s parliamentary pancake race . The . Deputy Prime Minister ‘made mistakes’ over the allegations against Lord . Rennard, according to a highly critical report into attitudes to women . among senior Liberal Democrats. Mr . Clegg conceded that ‘women had been let down’ after the independent . report said he should have ‘asked more questions’ when the claims – . which Lord Rennard denies – arose five years ago. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg admitted his party had failed women for 20 years . There were several missed chances to hold an investigation, the report added. The inquiry into the wider culture of . the Liberal Democrats spanning two decades was launched after the . Rennard claims surfaced earlier this year. Aside from the complaints by four . women against the peer, witnesses reported 32 other sexual harassment . and discrimination incidents – including one where a male . parliamentarian had made inappropriate advances to a very young male . worker. City fund manager . Helena Morrissey – who wrote the report – admitted she was . ‘shocked’ at the party’s failure to live up to its ideals of equality . and liberty, adding: ‘You have got to practise what you preach’. Mrs . Morrissey, who found evidence of ‘low level sexism’, said: ‘Mistakes . were definitely made. They . were made by Nick Clegg, Danny Alexander and Jo Swinson. 'You can make a . mistake and learn  from them, it’s different from setting out to . mislead or to do something wrong.’ But she added: ‘I am not exonerating . Nick Clegg.’ A formal . inquiry should have immediately been launched by Mr Clegg into the . allegations of improper conduct involving Lord Rennard when they were . raised by women in 2008, she said. Mr . Clegg said the report made ‘sobering reading’ and said there was ‘no . excuse’ for what had happened over 20 years in the party’s corridors of . power. He added that it illustrated that . ‘stretching over a 20-year period a series of mistakes were made which . left a number of women feeling seriously let down and for that there is . absolutely no excuse whatsoever’. Alleged victim Alison Smith has said she decided to go public because Lord Rennard appeared back on the scene . Criticism: The Lib Dem leadership was quickly accused of turning a 'blind eye' when party activist Bridget Harris spoke to Channel 4 News . Mrs Morrissey also singled out Liberal Democrat ministers Jo Swinson and . Danny Alexander for adopting an ‘informal’ approach to the complaints . which was ‘ultimately not sufficient’. The inquiry was triggered by the allegations surrounding Lord Rennard . but it was widened to include how the party dealt with other complaints . of sexism and harassment. It spanned complaints from up to 20 years ago. Mrs Morrissey said it . would not be fair however to hold the party to the same standards for . events of decades ago that are expected today. Her report said former leader Charles Kennedy’s ‘relatively relaxed . management style’, compared to his predecessor Lord Ashdown’s, . ‘contributed to Chris Rennard’s power base’. Paul Burstow, the party’s chief whip at the time, was also told of the claims about Lord Rennard in 2008. Businesswoman Helena Morrissey said Mr Clegg should have ordered a formal inquiry into allegations of sexual harassment against Lord Rennard . But the allegations did not surface publicly until this year, when Channel 4 interviewed two alleged victims. At the time, the party denied that Mr Clegg had any knowledge of specific allegations about Lord Rennard. He was also quick to criticise the ‘self appointed detectives’ of the . media as newspapers also investigated the potential scandal. Mrs Morrissey said there had been ‘no malicious attempt’ to cover up the . claims but that the way they dealt with them had been ‘haphazard’. The . Deputy Prime Minister had not launched a formal inquiry because he . believed the alleged victims had not requested one and wanted to keep . their anonymity, she said. Mr Clegg told the inquiry: ‘The natural course of action had been to . challenge Chris [Lord Rennard] in respect of the allegations and this . was duly done. He then denied any wrongdoing and the affair was dropped . since none of the complainants wished to …substantiate their . allegation.’ Mrs Morrissey admitted she was ‘shocked’ by some of the complaints, such . as one Lib Dem councillor aggressively cornering a female staff member. Mrs Morrissey criticised the ‘tendency for the party to try to “handle” complaints rather than to fully and properly investigate them in a . timely, professional manner.’ Scotland Yard is investigating allegations against the peer – who has denied any wrongdoing. Lord Rennard declined to comment. Mr Clegg said he would implement all the recommendations made in Miss . Morrissey’s report ‘without delay’ and had asked her to check on . progress in 12 months. He admitted the party had to do more, adding: ‘We must be a party where . even a hint of sexism is taken seriously; where every allegation of . harassment is dealt with properly; and where there can be no fear that . power or position can be abused.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Voluntarily attended south London police station today .

The annual alcohol-fuelled Suicide Sunday celebrations marking the end of Cambridge University's exam season got off to their customary raucous start with a cardboard boat race. In a parody of the more sober Oxford and Cambridge boat race on the Thames, students took to their makeshift vessels to row down the River Cam. Famed for being a day of carousing and drunken antics, the undergraduates stripped down to shorts and bikinis for a splash about on the River Cam. Scroll down for video . Using arm bands and rubber rings for support a team of three gingerly made their entrance for the beginning of the boat race . More than 30 homemade punts made from cardboard, glue and gaffer tape took to the River Cam, with competitors cheered on by hundreds of spectators . Armed with a bottle for Dutch courage, a team made their way to the water with their bird-shaped contraption . Taking a genteel approach, these Cambridge University students relaxed with some wine and port before heading to the starting line . The students spent the morning fashioning homemade punts and canoes from cardboard, glue and gaffer tape. After some Dutch courage, they then raced along the historic Backs for half a mile from Jesus Green to Magdalene Bridge as spectators cheered the wobbly vessels on from the tow path. Some were forced to bail out straight away as their soggy creations dissolved around them, but a few better-built rafts survived until the end of the course. More than 30 teams competed, some . vessels managing to only carry three people but a sturdy raft . managed to accommodate 10 people as it whistled past a wooden punt full of tourists. One student, who did not want to be . named, rejected the claims that they were behaving disrespectfully to other people who live in the town.

The proud creators of a boat, inexplicably holding a Kenny G poster, show off their secret rowing weapon - a racket covered in sellotape . Chaos ensued at the crowded starting line when the students began paddling frantically with an assortment of trays and plastic box lids . Many flimsy vessels disintegrated in seconds, leaving students scurrying for the banks . Comforted by a few cans of beer, two sodden teammates paddled to the side of the River Cam to make their inglorious exit . The 28-year-old, who studied History, said: 'I think its all just a bit of fun really. 'If we were throwing up on the streets it would different but everyone is in good spirits.' The boat race was among a number of parties taking place in Cambridge today to mark the beginning of May Week, in which students attend daily balls and garden parties to end the academic year on a high. Elsewhere in town, a garden party in Christ's College saw some students eating their own ties as part of an unusual initiation ceremony. Other students watched on as they drank gin, vodka and Pimm's in the gardens of the famous college. Most were on their best behaviour after being told by one of their directors of studies, Dr Robert Hunt, that boisterous behaviour would see them disciplined by the university. A spokesman for the University of Cambridge also advised students to be careful after trouble in previous years. The spokesman said: 'Students are frequently advised by their colleges to look after themselves, their friends and their valuables when out socialising. Looking chilly but confident the big team with an elaborate raft psyched themselves up for the race ahead . The raft went cruising past some bemused tourists relaxing on a traditional punt . The raft was suddenly overtaken by a more compact design, as both teams were watched by tourists who happened to be punting during the chaotic race . Students lined the banks to cheer on their brave friends in the cold water . They celebrated their surprising arrival at the end of the race by hugging each other and jumping in the river . This intrepid team waded out to dry off and carry on their revelries on solid ground . The day of drinking came a month after . 2,000 Cambridge students took part in Caesarian Sunday - a similar event . celebrating the end of term. Hundreds of students also attended . the annual party at Anstey Hall in a seventeenth century manor house in . the sleepy Cambridgeshire village of Trumpington. The exclusive party was organised three miles from the university by the Wyverns' drinking society. The garden party, which has a bikini dress code for girls and blazers and shorts for boys, involved downing excessive amounts of alcohol and riotous drinking games. The annual jelly wrestling contest, which usually sees two girls in bikinis wrestling in a pool of jelly, was cancelled this year following a petition saying it was 'sexist'. Jubilant scenes awaited the winners who miraculously managed to row through the entire 500 metres .

The clear up operation begins as binmen collected up the soggy cardboard this afternoon . Four years ago the party had to be held . in a new location for the first time in 80 years after officials banned . students from holding the event on university land. The controversial decision was made after a 23-year-old student was arrested during the infamous jelly wrestling contest in which bikini-clad students battle it out for a £250 prize, when she punched a spectator.

A project - which will have three traffic light classifications of green, amber and red - is aiming to cut down on the amount of harmful and inappropriate content that can be seen by children online. When amateur film-makers post clips online, they will be able to give them ratings corresponding to British Board of Film Classification levels - grouped into the three sets of U/PG, 12/15 and 18/R18. Protecting children: Videos such as this one filmed during the London riots of 2011 may be subject to an 'amber' rating because they could be distressing for younger viewers . Dangerous: Videos of extreme sportsmen or stunt artists suffering harm could be given red ratings, comparable to the 18 certificate received by the Jackass U.S. series . Video websites - not restricted to YouTube - would also be able to allow viewers to comment on how films were rated, which could alert users and national authorities to any serious mistakes. The idea of a do-it-yourself rating system for uploaded videos was formed though discussions between the BBFC and classification bodies in Italy and the Netherlands, reported The Observer. ‘This is a service we want to offer,’ BBFC policy spokesman David Austin told the newspaper. ‘We already classify some 10,000 videos and films that are submitted to us for release every year. ‘We will be using much the same classification model in the pilot for user-generated content.’ The extraordinary number of videos uploaded to YouTube and other video sharing websites every day has made it impossible for any regulatory board to watch all the footage themselves. No problems: Innocent videos on YouTube, such as the famous 'Charlie bit my finger - again' from 2007, would most likely be given a green (Universal or Parental Guidance) rating by the person uploading them . But the idea for an online questionnaire about the content uploaded by an amateur producer was formed after conversations with the Dutch film regulator, reported The Observer. The BBFC said that the questionnaire results will mean ‘different things in different countries’ - such as users in the Netherlands not worrying so much about bad language, compared to the British. It is expected that the system will be tested from this summer. Access that children can get to inappropriate online content is a concern for many parents. The Mail is campaigning for internet providers to automatically block access to porn, with an optional opt-in, rather than parents having to rely on software to limit access. Last week research revealed one in four children who try to get around parental controls on internet use are looking for pornography.","Film-makers will give ratings for videos corresponding to BBFC levels .

It started out as a tiny aeroplane manufacturing company in Seattle trying to push the boundaries of the emerging aviation industry in the middle of the First World War. Today, as it celebrates its 75th anniversary of trading in Britain, Boeing is known the world over as the market leader of the aviation world. But while most will associate the Boeing with commercial jet liners, the company played a critical role in Britain's efforts during World War II. Scroll down for video . Where it all began: Britain purchased its first ever plane from Boeing, The North American Harvard, in June, 1938, for aerial reconnaissance and training . Hard at work: Aviation experts put together a Harvard in the late 1930s for the British military . History: Boeing's production of the Harvards, pictured, started a 75-year-long relationship with Britain that is still going strong today . Britain first turned to Boeing in June 1938, when the Air Ministry purchased 200 Harvard training aircraft from its legacy company North American. Since then, Boeings have dominated Britain's skies, supplying jets to our airlines, as well as Chinook helicopters and C-17 transport aircraft to the Royal Air Force. Sir Roger Bone, President of Boeing in the UK, said: 'The long-term commitment and partnership that Boeing has shared with the UK over the past 75 years has delivered a safer, more connected world. 'The UK is a critically important market, supplier base and a source of some of the world’s most inventive technology. Speedy transport: On March 20, 1941, the British Government purchased three Boeing 314s, pictured, for The British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) for use as transport aircrafts . New line: In July 1942, Boeing began producing the Eighth Air Force in Britain, equipped with B-17Es, pictured . At war: By 1942, RAF A-20 Boston Bombers had been manufactured for Britain's air-force for World War II . 'From our employees to our customers and our suppliers to our research partners, the relationship supports the UK’s Armed Forces, facilitates trade between the UK and the rest of the world and supports many thousands of highly-skilled, high value British jobs.'

In March, 1941, the British Government purchased three Boeing 314s for The British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) for use as transport aircraft. The 314s became best known for carrying Winston Churchill on his intercontinental journeys. In July 1942, Boeing began producing B-17Es for the Eighth Air Force in Britain. Making history: In 1944, hundreds of British RAF DC-3 Dakotas, pictured, were used to transport paratroopers and weapons across the English Channel on D-Day . New way to travel: On May 27, 1960, the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) introduced the Boeing 707 aircraft on its London to New York service . First time for everything: On April 25, 1971, the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) operates its first Boeing 747 flight between London Heathrow and New York . The B-17s were flown by the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) throughout the American participation in the Second World War to bombard German targets in Europe during daylight hours. The company also produced the British RAF DC-3 Dakotas which were used to transport paratroopers and weapons across the English Channel on D-Day. Boeing has continued to produce military craft for Britain over the decades as well as new commercial liners - with its latest 'ultra-green' Boeing 787 Dreamliner making its debut earlier this year. Boeing employs more than 1,300 people across the UK at numerous sites stretching from Glasgow to Gosport. The company spends an annual average of £650 million in the UK with more than 250 suppliers.

Local government heads say they would have to consider efficiency measures including closing parks and libraries, as well as switching off street lights, just to maintain their legal obligation to provide care. Town halls may be forced to switch off street lights unless they get more money to pay for the care of the elderly in their own homes, council leaders have warned . The letter to George Osborne, from the Tory-dominated Local Government Association, which represents 370 councils, comes as he finalises the next round of cuts in the spending review. The LGA argues that the amount of money spent on social care has already been slashed by a fifth in less than three years - and they warn that they are preparing to reduce budgets further. The town hall leaders say that, while they have been able to save most of that money by squeezing the amount they pay to care homes and other contractors, they are running out of ways to cut costs. The LGA’s letter calls for fundamental change in the way money is allocated and an end to the special protections that the health service budget enjoys. Council leaders have written to Chancellor George Osborne to plead for more NHS funding to be diverted into their coffers to help meet the spiralling costs of care for pensioners and the disabled . ‘Social care is one of the things that you lie awake at night worrying about,’ said Sir Merrick Cockell, the Conservative leader of Kensington and Chelsea council in London, who is chairman of the LGA. ‘It is one of the most serious responsibilities that we have got and we take that very seriously but we know that we can’t really restrict the spending any more. ‘Most of us are pretty well at the “critical” level, as far as criteria for care go, we know we’ve got an ageing population and care is becoming more expensive, all the pressures are there.’ He added: ‘If Government doesn’t give us what we hope on sharing and integration at national and local budget level, the services like libraries, like leisure centres, like the way that parks are kept or indeed street lights being on all through the night, councils will have to look at saving money on those things.’","Council leaders written to Chancellor to plead for more NHS funding .

The body of Moors Murder victim Keith Bennett may have been buried nearly 40 miles from Saddleworth Moor, the focus of the search for his remains up to now, according to a forthcoming TV documentary. The programme claims that photographs taken by Myra Hindley and Ian Brady as ‘grave markers’  during their killing spree show a Staffordshire beauty spot called Ramshaw Rocks. Now experts are calling on police to search the site in case it is the 12-year-old’s final resting place. Potential clue: The photograph shows Ian Brady holding a dog above his head at Ramshaw Rocks in Staffordshire . The news comes as Ian Brady is launching a legal battle to be given the right to die, according to the Sunday Telegraph. The Moors murderer has been on hunger strike for the last thirteen years but is tube fed because he is sectioned under the Mental Health Act. This week he will appear on a video link in the attempt to convince a Mental Health Tribunal that he should be declared sane and moved to a Scottish prison, where inmates are not force-fed. The tribunal has been criticised by Keith Bennett's family, who say he should not be able to control his own fate. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, the solicitor who acted on behalf of Keith's mother Winnie Johnson spoke out against the hearing. John Ainley said: 'She took the view that he did not give her son and the other children any choice and consequently he should not be able to control his own fate'. Brady's other victims – all aged between ten and 17 – were Pauline Reade, John Kilbride, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans. They were killed in and around Manchester between July 1963 and October 1965 and their bodies were discovered in graves dug on Saddleworth Moor, above Oldham. Survived: Carol Waterhouse, pictured with her neighbour Myra Hindley. Ms Waterhouse has revealed that she and her brother spent a day on Saddleworth Moor with the two killers . Victim: 12-year-old Keith Bennett disappeared on the way to his grandmother's house in 1964. Brady is believed to have sexually assaulted and strangled Bennett. Keith’s body was also thought to have been hidden there but it has never been found. Hindley, . who died in prison aged 60 in 2002, and Brady, 75, who is held in . high-security Ashworth Hospital on Merseyside, took hundreds of . photographs as grisly mementos. The ITV documentary - entitled Brady And Hindley: Possession - suggests that some of the pictures may hold the key to the whereabouts of Keith’s grave, and possibly to the burial sites of other, as yet unidentified, young victims. Author Duncan Staff, who has written extensively about the Moors Murders, said: ‘Ian Brady has been collaborating on a book to be published on his death in which he will allegedly claim there were nine murders, not just the five we know about. ‘For 50 years Brady has enjoyed game-playing. The fact that this case remains unresolved gives him a great sense of satisfaction. Search: Police found three victims in graves dug on Saddleworth Moor. One grave was discovered over 20 years after Brady and Hindley's trial in 1966 . Tragic: Despite comprehensive searches of Saddleworth Moor, Keith Bennett's body has not been found . 'I can’t say from these photographs . that X marks the spot but they are of enough significance to warrant a . proper search of Ramshaw Rocks.’ His views are supported by Myra Hindley’s long-term lover Trisha Cairns and forensic archaeologist Professor John Hunter. Mr Staff said: ‘I described the pictures to Trisha, which included wild, rocky landscapes and Ian Brady holding a dog over his head in front of a jagged rock. Trisha immediately said she thought they were markers because of the system the killers used.’ Prof Hunter has carried out his own investigation by matching the pictures with the Ramshaw Rocks landscape but says only a full police search will establish the truth. Faces of evil: Ian Brady (left) and Myra Hindley's (right) crimes horrified the nation because of their callousness. Grave markers: Myra Hindley (pictured) and her partner Ian Brady took hundreds of pictures near the graves of their victims . The programme, to be screened next . month, includes an interview with Carol Waterhouse who, along with her . brother David, had a day out on Saddleworth Moor with the killers – and . survived. Ms Waterhouse lived a couple of doors away from Hindley and Brady. Tragic: Keith Bennett's mother Winnie Johnson died last year having never been able to bury her son . Now . a successful businesswoman, she tells the programme: ‘Myra was sociable . and bubbly whereas Brady kept to the background more.

Prince Charles bought a 396,000 sq ft warehouse complex in a vast supermarket depot near Milton Keynes . Prince Charles famously abhors modern architecure - especially the boxy ‘monstrous carbuncle’ buildings that he believes have  blighted the face of Britain. But his strong views have not stopped the heir to the throne investing £38million in a vast supermarket depot near Milton Keynes, it emerged last night. The Prince bought the sprawling 396,000 sq ft warehouse complex from an Anglo-Indian property fund, one of the single largest acquisitions by his Duchy of Cornwall estate. The deal was competed 18 months ago but has only emerged now. Like other significant deals, the purchase of the warehouse in November 2011 from Indian property fund Meghraj Properties had to be approved by the Lord Commissioners of the Treasury. The depot is currently leased to Waitrose, who use it as a lorry distribution hub. Prince Charles sent shock waves through the architecture world in 1984 when he used a speech to the 150th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects to lambast modern design, describing a towering extension to the National Gallery as a ‘monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend’. His views have changed little since then. In 2009 he opposed a £1billion housing scheme at the former Chelsea Barracks in London. In the same year, he said: ‘I don’t go around criticising other people’s private artworks. I may not like some of them very much, but it is their business what they choose to put in their houses. ‘However, as I have said before, architecture and the built environment affect us all.’ Land Registry records list the distribution centre Brinklow in the name of the Duchy of Cornwall and the Prince’s full titles - ‘His Royal Highness Charles Philip Arthur George, Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwall and Rothesay, Earl of Chester and Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles and Great Steward of Scotland’. The Prince called the Salisbury sing of the National Gallery a 'monstrous carbuncle' in a controversial speech . The sale price was £38,385,500. The Duchy’s full holdings are worth £693million and include Dartmoor Prison, the Oval cricket ground in central London, a Holiday Inn in Reading, the Prince’s private homes such as Highgrove and land in the Scilly Isles. Between 2009 and the end of 2012 the Duchy conducted property transactions worth at least £102million, the Independent reported last night. The management of the Duchy - including investment decisions on commercial - is carried out by a professional managerial team. But Prince Charles is known to take a close personal interest in the running of the estate. He voluntarily pays income tax on the income he receives from the Duchy - including £4.5million last year from income of £18.3million. The Prince of Wales has also criticised the redevelopment of the Chelsea Barracks . Last night a Duchy of Cornwall spokeswoman said the Milton Keynes property was acquired as ‘a commercial property investment.’ She added: ‘The Duchy of Cornwall is a private estate not a public body and is not funded by the taxpayer. ‘The Prince of Wales chooses to use his private money from the estate to pay for his public duties, as well as those of The Duchess of Cornwall, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. ‘He also chooses to pay income tax on the income generated by The Duchy. ‘The Duke of Cornwall manages the estate for present and future Dukes, and for the wider benefit of tenants, communities and the environment.’","Prince Charles spent £38million in a supermarket depot near Milton Keynes .

Women having caesarean sections could soon be saying goodbye to staples, stitches and unsightly scars – thanks to a medical version of a welding torch. An Israeli firm has developed a stitch and staple-free method of ‘welding’ together surgical wounds which it claims creates neater joins. It says that mothers-to-be undergoing c-sections could be among the first to benefit, with treatments carried out as soon as this autumn. The company says that it takes just three or four minutes to seal a c-section wound and that scarring is minimal . It is hoped the new way of closing wounds will also be suitable for burns victims and cosmetic surgery patients. IonMed’s device is based on plasma – a charged form of gas normally only seen in lightning bolts and in the intense light produced by welding torches. The plasma used in the BioWeld gadget is much cooler, ensuring it does not damage delicate tissue. At around 40C it is hot enough to make the skin tingle but not cause pain. However, it still produces a very powerful flame and when channelled through the tip of a pen-like device, it welds a thin film of specially-designed material – based on a naturally occurring sugar – over the wound, closing it. It is hoped eventually the thin film can be dispensed with and the powerful plasma alone will be enough to seal wounds. In three clinical trials on women undergoing c-sections, in which an eight-inch incision is made along the bikini line, the wounds healed better than the stitches and staples currently in use. The company says that it takes just three or four minutes to seal a c-section wound and that scarring is minimal. Mothers-to-be undergoing c-sections could be among the first to benefit, with treatments carried out as soon as this autumn . The gas is also said to encourage the growth of blood vessels, ensuring the area that was operated on receives a good supply of blood. It is also anti-bacterial, so should reduce the risk of wounds becoming infected. Although many c-section wounds that are sealed by stitches or staples heal well, a recent study found that up to 44 per cent of women still had a raised, red scar six months on. Gian Carlo Di Renzo, a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology in Perugia in Italy, described BioWeld’s results as ‘very encouraging’. He added: ‘As surgeons, we seek better ways to connect tissue, to minimise damage to healthy tissue and obtain better clinical and cosmetic results for patients.’ Ronen Lam, vice president of business development at IonMed, the company behind BioWeld, said: ‘No one has done this before. ‘Using plasma enhances the complex wound healing process. ‘Doctors can learn how to use this very quickly.  There is almost no learning curve.’ BioWeld was invented by Ronen Lam’s brother Amnon, who was a medic in the Israeli army before becoming a project manager at a firm that uses cold plasma to create semiconductors. He came up with the idea of combining his combat medical experience with cold plasma technology. The company has submitted documentation for approval so that BioWeld can be used by doctors and hospitals in Europe. It says approval process should take a matter of months, meaning the new system could available for use on patients by the autumn. Hospitals will have to pay around £2,500 for the equipment, plus around £10 to £15 for the kit needed for each caesarean operation.","An Israeli firm has developed a method of ‘welding’ together surgical wounds .

More than 4,000 lives a year are lost as a result of poor care in hospitals at weekends, NHS officials have warned. A review of Britain’s emergency and urgent healthcare system today reveals that it is unsustainable, unaffordable and soaking up more than half of the Health Service budget. Health officials are to launch plans which will attempt to tackle the deepening crisis in accident & emergency units, hospital wards and out-of-hours GP services. Care crisis: At least 4,400 lives a year are lost in England because hospital death rates are worse at weekends, largely as a result of a shortage of senior doctors . They have collected evidence of a health system buckling under the strain and placing patients at increased risk – particularly when they need care at weekends. The damning official report says at least 4,400 lives a year are lost in England because hospital death rates are worse at weekends, largely as a result of a shortage of senior doctors. It warns that spiralling numbers of patients are readmitted to hospital because they were discharged too quickly, due to cuts to bed numbers. There is also evidence of a 30 per cent rise in death rates when casualty units are crowded; widespread shortages of A&E doctors, with half of training posts unfilled for the past two years; confusion among the public about how to access urgent care; a lack of confidence in GP care. Made our bed: The damning figures in the report were released as a review of ¿urgent and emergency care¿ in England begins . The dossier is published as NHS England begins a public consultation on a review of ‘urgent and emergency care’, which could lead to a major restructuring of the NHS. This could see more specialist services concentrated in larger units and changes to ensure hospitals perform better at weekends, with more consultants and diagnostic tests available. Despite widespread concerns about the failings of the non-emergency 111 telephone line, which was introduced in most parts of England this year, the official leading the review told the Daily Telegraph that the future model of emergency care will rely heavily on phone-led services. Professor Keith Willett, the director of NHS England in charge of urgent and emergency care, said: ‘We need to redesign the system because it is not sustainable as it is.’","At least 4,400 lives a year lost in England as a result of poor weekend care .

Colourful: Outspoken Leeds United chairman Ken Bates arrives Leeds County Court to answer Melvyn Levi's harassment allegations . Leeds United chairman Ken Bates used Elland Road stadium’s PA system to issue a ‘wanted’ notice for a former club director who he claimed owed him money, a court heard. The 80-year-old owner also took to the airwaves to track down businessman Melvyn Levi, asking Yorkshire Radio listeners for tips as to his whereabouts as he sought to claw back more than £190,000 he said Mr Levi owed the club. Leeds County Court heard Mr Bates told the club’s solicitor he would arrange for the station to broadcast a similar announcement every day for a fortnight, offering listeners dinner for two in exchange for information on his supposed debtor. Mr Levi, 67, said the announcements led football fans to assume he was ‘some sort of fugitive’, and now he and his wife Carole are seeking damages for alleged harassment by Mr Bates, Leeds United and Yorkshire Radio, which broadcasts live commentary of the club’s matches. This latest courtroom battle marks a new chapter in a dispute that has run since Mr Bates bought the club from the Yorkshire Consortium, of which Mr Levi was a member, in 2005. Mr Levi was awarded £50,000 in 2009 after the chairman wrote libellous remarks about him in a Leeds United match day programme. Now he and his wife claim they have suffered stress as a result of the broadcast announcement allegedly likening Mr Levi to a criminal on the run. They also say comments made by Mr Bates in his programme notes amounted to speculation over the state of their marriage. Yesterday - the third day of the case - the court heard from Jersey-based solicitor Hiren Mistry, who was instructed by the club as it sought to serve Mr Levi with a writ in December 2010. Mr Bates was pursuing legal action for more than £190,000 which he claims is owed to the club by Mr Levi and his business partner, Robert Weston. Papers were served on Mr Weston without any problems but, when a process server arrived at Mr Levi’s home, the former director was not in. The server asked whether he could leave the papers in Mr Levi’s letterbox, but it was decided that they should be handed to him personally, the court heard. Mr Mistry told the hearing it was suggested to him that Mrs Levi, who was at the house, had been ‘evasive’ when asked by the process server where her husband was. He said the papers had to be served ‘urgently’ because any delay in the legal proceedings would be ‘costly’ to the club. But Mr Mistry agreed he did not ask the server to try again, even after the club’s chief executive Shaun Harvey rang to say that Mr Levi had been spotted in a Leeds restaurant. Foe: Former club executive Mr Levi arrives at court, where he is seeking damages over Mr Bates' attempts to reclaim money he says he is owed . Simon Myerson QC, for the Levis, asked Mr Mistry: ‘Is it because Mr Bates had told you there would be announcements on Yorkshire Radio every day for two weeks, offering dinner for two for information provided?’ Mr Mistry said: ‘He did tell me that, yes.’ Mr Myerson continued: ‘Is it the case Mr Bates said “Don’t worry about service - we are going to put a radio announcement out”?’ ‘Absolutely not,’ Mr Mistry replied. ‘Procedure is procedure.’ On hearing about the reported sighting of the Levis, Mr Mistry said: ‘If it was concrete we would have acted upon it.’ The lawyer told the court he did not instruct the relevant people to serve the legal papers as he wanted to keep legal costs down for Mr Bates and Leeds United. In 2009, Mr Levi successfully sued Mr Bates for libel over articles written in the programme, and the Leeds chairman was ordered to pay £50,000 damages plus costs to Mr Levi. The court has heard that Yorkshire Radio broadcast an announcement during Leeds’ home match against Leicester City on Boxing Day 2010, asking anyone who knew Mr Levi’s whereabouts to contact the club. Mr Levi’s witness statement said: ‘I understand from people I have spoken to who were listening to the broadcast that an announcement was made before the match and again at half time asking if anyone knew of my whereabouts and, if so, to contact the club who wished to serve me with legal papers. ‘I am told by people at the match that a similar announcement was made over the club Tannoy system during and/or before the home match against Middlesbrough on January 1, 2011. ‘The people who I have spoken to who heard the announcement have said they assumed I was some sort of fugitive.’ The hearing was told Mr Bates also used his match day notes for the Middlesbrough game to speculate about why Mr Levi was not there and to imply the couple had spent Christmas apart. Captive audience: Leeds United's home ground Elland Road, where Mr Bates is said to have used the PA system to ask fans for details on Mr Levi's whereabouts as he tried to serve him with court papers . Mr Levi said: ‘A number of people have since asked me if we are having marital problems and that is also very upsetting.’ Mr Bates has dismissed as ‘rubbish’ suggestions he used his column programme to pursue a personal ‘vendetta’ against Mr Levi. The London-born executive took control of Leeds United seven years ago, paying £10 million for the club at a time when it was swamped with debt. This was the second time he had stepped in to pull a team out of dire financial straits, having bought an embattled Chelsea for just £1 in 1982. Mr Bates stayed at Stamford Bridge for 21 years, during which he gained a reputation for controversy until he sold Chelsea to Roman Abramovich in 2003. Among the more headline-grabbing episodes was his rejected proposal in 1985 to combat hooliganism by fitting electric fences around the pitch.","Former club executive Melvyn Levi has taken the Leeds owner to court seeking damages for harassment .

But believe it or not, nineties-style sports trainers are apparently making a comeback - and fashion experts are saying it won’t be long before we’re all wearing them. Nike Air Max trainers are now being sported by a raft of celebrities, including singers Rita Ora and Lily Allen, Twilight actor Robert Pattison and even President Obama. Retro: Fashion experts say that we will all be wearing Nike Air Max trainers again soon as sales have gone up . The shoe, which was first released in the UK 25 years ago, is enjoying a revival all over the country as part of a return of sportswear, according to retailers. Online shopping website Asos reported a 320 per cent growth in sales of Nike Air Max since last year while high street store Schuh also reported an increase. The shoe, which features a trademark air bubble displayed on the sole, was popularised in the nineties by musicians and sports personalities. Fashion experts say this year’s revival was prompted by a nostalgia for the decade, which many now see as a ‘golden era’. Sporty: Singer and fashionista Rita Ora used Instagram to show her love for Nike Air Max trainers . Star: The star has many pairs of the trainers, which are said to become the next must have footwear . David Spencer, product and marketing director at Schuh said: ‘Nineties sport is the footwear of choice and we have seen a massive uplift in sales for this type of footwear, especially on ladies - where we are seeing girls who aren’t traditionally sports customers buying into the trend too.’ Nichola Carroll, branded footwear buyer for Asos, added: ‘We have seen a 320 per cent growth on Nike Air Max trainers on the same period for the previous year, making them the casual wardrobe staple. ‘There has been an increase across all trainers.’ Unique: Dizzee Rascal has worn Nike Air Max trainers and even has a customised pair . Fans: The trainers, worn by Lily Allen (left) and Jared Leto (right), have seen a 320% increase in sales on Asos . Nike Air Max were first introduced in 1987 after designer Tinker Hatfield hit upon the novel idea of showing the inside of the sole with a ‘bubble’. The design was inspired by the Pompidou Centre in Paris, which has its steel structure, escalators and pipes all exposed on the outside. The craze for Nike Air Max trainers spread far and wide - rapper Dizzee Rascal had a customised pair while basketball star LeBron James had an entire line. At the time, they were also adopted by those on the nineties dance scene, where ravers often stayed up all night partying in fields. Approval: Even US President Barack Obama has been spotted sporting the retro trainers . Experts say the new trend for the retro shoe is down to a new nostalgia for the era, when Britain for the most part enjoyed a flourishing economy. Adam Saville, clubs editor for the publication DJ Mag, told The Observer that youngsters are increasingly turning to the nineties for inspiration. He said: ‘When the future’s bleak, there’s a fetishisation of what came before. People are looking back as if it was some sort of golden age.’ Sarah Raphael, online editor for I-D magazine, added: ‘It’s the rule of the 20-year cycle. ‘The 00s relived the 80s with Dr Martens; the 10s are reliving the 90s and sportswear is back.’","Rita Ora, Lily Allen, Dizzee Rascal and President Obama have worn them .

Her weekend of campaigning with her comedian younger brother began in New York with a $5,200-a-plate dinner and fundraiser on the Upper West Side. Scroll down for video .

The pair then flew down to South Carolina for a bowling party and then another $5,200-a-plate dinner at the private home of a supporter. General admission for the bowling party cost $250, but people could also pay $1,000 for a private reception. The invitation for the fundraiser came with a note from Colbert. 'Lulu and I have been through a lot together, and I know she is a bright, competent, caring woman who will work hard on behalf of all the citizens of South Carolina’s 1st Congressional District,' Colbert says in the e-mail invitation. 'There are three Democrats and sixteen Republicans running in the Primary, including former Governor and renowned hike-lover Mark Sanford. Our chances look good.' Colbert, of course, was referring to Sanford's infamous cover-up for his six-day disappearance in  2009 while he was governor of South Carolina. Sanford told his staff he was hiking the Appalachian trail, before he eventually came clean about the fact that he had been with his mistress in Argentina.

Despite his affair, Sanford, a Republican, is still considered the favorite to win the 1st District House seat. The heavily Republican district gave President Obama only 40 percent of the vote in 2012 and more than a dozen Republicans are vying for the seat. So even if Colbert Busch wins the Democratic nomination, she will face a steep uphill climb to win the special election. Colbert, who plays a faux Republican newscaster on 'The Colbert Report,' said he is campaigning for his sister despite her Democratic loyalties because he owed her a debt from when they were little.

'I don't actually have anything to offer people in a public office,' he said. 'It's natural for her to run because she has skills and something to offer society. I am professionally ridiculous.

Casey Anthony's defence team have been branded insensitive and loutish after they were spotted celebrating their court victory with a lavish champagne party. In an unapologetic display many have slammed as inappropriate considering the serious nature of their case, Jose Baez and his team were seen downing drinks as they watched reaction to their client being found not guilty of brutally murdering her two-year-old child Caylee. Stunned onlookers gasped and shouted abuse to protest the scenes, while high-profile commentators were clearly outraged, with one comparing the scenes to the work of the devil. Scroll down for video . Appropriate? Defense attorney Cheney Mason makes an obscene gesture . The sensational acquittal of Casey Anthony after a dramatic six-week trial has stunned America, with angry spectators comparing the trial’s outcome to the infamous verdict in the OJ Simpson case. Anthony, 25, is poised to walk free tomorrow morning and sell her story for millions, after the jury failed to find her guilty of the murder of her daughter Caylee. But inside trendy restaurant . Terrace 390 in Orlando, where waiters carry iPads and beer sells for as . little as $3, the party-loving young mother's defence team celebrated and drank with complete disregard for the strength of feeling surrounding them. Party time: The defence counsel celebrate their victory in a local bar . Pint-sized: Baez revels in his moment of glory with a glass of beer as he glares towards the crown outside . 'Champagne toast': Cheney Mason knocks back a drink with colleagues . Were jury right to acquit Casey Anthony of murdering her daughter? At one point, attorney . Cheney Mason could be seen making an obscene gesture to an angry crowd . outside, an apparent gesture of contempt towards anyone who dares . criticise the team. As the group mingled with TV personality Geraldo Rivera, fellow defence lawyer Dorothy Clay . Sims was then spotted jigging up and down, performing a victory dance for . her colleagues before turning her phone towards outraged onlookers to . film their shocked reactions. Commentators, . led invariably by the notoriously vocal Nancy Grace, immediately . reacted with rage to footage showing the unapologetic celebrations. Grace showed the video on television last night as a focus for her frustrations about the outcome of the high-profile case. 25-year-old . defendant Casey was sensationally acquitted yesterday of first-degree . murder and is poised to walk free tomorrow morning after the jury failed . to find her guilty of the murder of her daughter Caylee. Speaking about the post-trial party, Grace said: . 'The defence team is inside a bar having a champagne toast right now. Now you know what? I'm not a preacher and I'm not a rabbi but there's . something wrong with that. Spotted: Dorothy Clay Sims performs a victory dance for her colleagues . Jovial: She then turns to film onlookers with her cell phone . Dis-grace: Nancy was not impressed by the antics . 'Because Caylee is dead and her body . decomposed just fifteen houses away from where the Anthony's put their . head on the pillow every night, every day searching for this little . girl.' She went on with typical hyperbole, suggesting the scenes of celebration were so cruel the devil would be dancing. She . said: 'Now I know it is our duty as American citizens to respect the . jury system and I do, believe me I do. I've struck over a hundred . juries. 'But I know . one thing. As the defence sits by and has their champagne toast after . that not guilty verdict, somewhere out there, the devil is dancing . tonight.' Outside the restaurant, onlookers were shocked that the party was going on. One spectator, Patrick Fowler, from Orlando, called out for Baez to leave the restaurant, which the attorney ignored, while drinking what appeared to be a beer. A few minutes later, colleague Mason . approached the window and made the obscene gesture with his hand, which . was caught on camera. Wanda . Tyler, from Orlando, told the Orlando Sentinel: 'They shouldn't be . celebrating. A little girl is dead and they helped her killer go free.' A spokesman for the Terrace 390 restaurant said: 'We would like to remind everyone that we do not dictate who walks through our doors. 'In no way does our clientele reflect our personal thoughts or opinions on the outcome of any legal or political proceedings.' Meanwhile, the prosecution have spoken of their surprise at the verdict.

Huddle: The team were open with their celebrations in court as well, hugging and kissing each other like a victorious college sports team . Team spirit: Baez and Clay Sims held Casey's hands as the verdict was read out . 'I don't think it was the lack of DNA' linking Anthony to her daughter's death that undermined the case, Mr Ashton said. 'It was the cause of death.' 'We were pretty shocked' at the not guilty verdict, he said. 'We put on everything that an investigation, a really thorough investigation over three years, produced. That's the way it goes. I think I mouthed ""Wow"" five times.' Mr Ashton, who is retiring after this case, said that he believes one of the most powerful pieces of evidence was the photo of Caylee's decomposed skull with pieces of duct tape where her mouth and nose would have been. 'What I've said all along is if a jury looks at that photograph and doesn't see it the way I do and doesn't know how she died, then so be it,' Mr Ashton told The View.

Guilty plea: Ashley Anderson, 24, pleaded guilty to three counts of sexual exploitation by a school employee after accused of having sexual relations with several teenage students . A former math teacher in north-central Iowa has pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with several teenage students. Ashley Anderson, 24 of Ackley, accepted a deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty in Butler County District Court to three counts of sexual exploitation by a school employee. The state agreed to drop a fourth count, The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reports, with each carrying a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Police arrested the 24-year-old in October. She was hired in 2010 by the Aplington-Parkersburg school district, where she taught high school math and served as the faculty adviser for Students Against Drunk Driving and the prom committee. She resigned last fall following a criminal complaint over her behavior during the 2011-2012 school year. That complaint accused her of sending nude photographs of herself to the students and having sexual contact with them. It included having performed oral sex on three other students. The boys ranged in age from 16 to 18. Police said they received information that Anderson had sexually abused a teen who confided in a friend at the high school. A fellow teacher heard about the allegation and contacted police, KETV reported. A sentencing hearing is set for June. School: Anderson was a math teacher at Aplington-Parkersburg High School in Iowa City, Iowa, pictured, until her resignation following the shocking criminal complaint . Anderson is alleged to have first begun a relationship with an 18-year-old who was in her math class before having sex with the teen at his home. The criminal complaint charges she also had oral sex with a 16-year-old junior who served on the prom committee and a 16-year-old sophomore. A fourth relationship with a 17-year-old student included a kiss on a gravel road after track practice last spring and continued after he graduated from the school, the complaint says. In each case, 'Anderson admitted to the conduct,' according to the complaint, which said the relationships spanned from August 1, 2011 to June 30. In a statement released shortly after the complaint was filed, Aplington-Parkersburg High School said: 'We can affirm that our students will always be our first priority and that we have followed all school policies on matters such as this and that the school cooperated fully with the police investigation,' the statement said.","Ashley Anderson has pleaded guilty to three counts of sexual exploitation by a school employee .

Jiroemon Kimura, who was born on April 19, 1897, was not only the world's oldest person but also the world's oldest ever living man. The former postman died in his hospital bed in Kyotango, Japan where he had been undergoing treatment for pneumonia. Mr Kimura had been officially recognised by the Guinness World Records as the world's oldest living person and the oldest man ever. Scroll down for video . What an innings: Jiroemon Kimura, the world's oldest person and the oldest ever man is pictured with one of his 15 great-great-grandchildren in Kyotango, western Japan, where he died today . After living through two world wars, Mr Kimura went on to live another 68 years. He once attributed his longevity to getting out in the sunlight . According to Guinness, Mr Kimura, a former postman, was the first man in history to have lived to 116 years old. He is survived by seven children, 14 . grandchildren, 25 great-grandchildren, and 15 great-great-grandchildren, . Japanese media said. The oldest living man is officially 111-year-old American James McCoubrey, who was born on September 13, 1901. However a great-grandfather living in Britain has disputed this claiming he is 113. Ghahreman Pardis's Iranian birth . certificate says he was born on November 2, 1903, making him 109  but . his family say his papers were doctored twice so he could dodge national . service. They say he was actually born in 1899, which makes him 113 years and 69 days old. His true age became masked when Mr . Pardis faced conscription as a teenager in Turkey where he was as a . leading boxer, his relatives claim. Record breaker: Mr Kimura, is handed a certificate of the world's oldest ever living man in 2012 . Mr Kimura is congratulated by Kyotango City Mayor Yasushi Nakayama as he celebrates his 116th birthday at his home on April 19 . Government chiefs wanted to keep the . sporting champion so they altered his passport to show his birthday as . two years later - in 1901 - ensuring he would not be drafted. Then during his 20s Mr Pardis moved . to Iran where he became a sports coach and key figure building sports . facilities in the country. Iranian officials were so impressed . with his role in the country they too altered his date of birth by two . years so he could avoid joining the army. The death of Mr Kiruma comes just a few days after . that of a woman in China who claimed to be 127, which would have made . her the real record holder by a wide margin. Luo Meizhen lived in Bama county in China's Guangxi region's - an area famous for the longevity of its residents. Her . ID card stated she was born in 1885, but she does not have a birth . certificate to prove this so her claim was never officially recognised. Ghahreman Pardis from Iran who lives in Buckinghamshire, England claims he is now the world's oldest man . Mr Pardis claims his passport was doctored to show that he was younger so he could avoid national service . If . Ms Luo was truly 127, it would make her the oldest person ever to have . lived, beating Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997 aged 122. Mr . Kimura became the oldest man ever on Dec. 28, 2012, at the age of 115 . years, 253 days, breaking the record set by Christian Mortensen, a . Danish immigrant to the United States, whose life spanned from . 1882-1998. A nun believed to hold the world record of 86 years cloistered in a monastery has died in Spain aged 105. Sister Maria Romero, abbess of the Buenafuente del Sistal monastery outside Madrid said that Sister Teresita Barajuen had died overnight. She entered the Cistercian monastery when she was 19, the abbess said. Sister Teresita acknowledged in interviews that like many young women at the time, she never intended being a nun but entered the monastery because of family pressure. In 2011 she left the monastery for the first time in 40 years to meet now-retired Benedict XVI during a papal visit to Madrid. She had entered the monastery on the same day he was born. The title of oldest living person is now held by another Japanese person, 115-year-old Misao Okawa, of Osaka. Craig Glenday, editor-in-chief of Guinness World Records said: 'Jiroemon Kimura was an exceptional person. 'As . the only man to have ever lived for 116 years — and the oldest man . whose age has been fully authenticated — he has a truly special place in . world history.' Kyotango officials said Mr Kimura's funeral would be held Friday. The town's mayor Mayor Yasushi . Nakayamasaid: 'Mr Kimura was and will always be a treasure to our town, . to our country and to our world.' On his 115th birthday, Mr Kimura had attributed his longevity to getting out in the sunlight. 'I am always looking up towards the sky. That is how I am,' According to local media, Kimura ate a three-meal-a-day diet of rice, pumpkins and sweet potatoes. He reportedly did not smoke and said he only ate until he felt 80 per cent full. According to one town official his motto in life  was 'to eat light and live long'. He celebrated his 116th birthday on April 19 by watching a video message of congratulations from Japan's prime minister. Challenger: Mr Kimura's death comes just days after that of Chinese woman Luo Meizhen (left) who claimed to be 127.  His death means 115-year-old Tomohito Okada from Osaka, Japan is now the world's oldest person . When he was born back in 1897, Japan was coming to the end of its feudal period which saw the final days of the Samurai warrior class and the birth of a modern imperialist state. When Japan entered WWI on the side of the British in 1915 he was already 18 years old, and when it allied itself with Germany in 1940 at the start of WWII he was already pushing on 43. When the U.S. dropped the bomb on Hiroshima he was 48 but he resumed work as a postman at the end of the war and went on to live for another 68 years. Japan has more than 50,000 centenarians, 2011 government data showed, reinforcing its reputation for longevity.","Jiroemon Kimura, who was born in .

Every now and again she would give  it a hug or swing it by the ears as  she spoke. The teddy was a white bear called Minty. The little girl was a crucial witness in the April Jones murder trial. Yesterday, in juvenile, matter-of-fact tones, she described what she saw at the moment the prosecution say April was abducted and driven off to her death. Hearing: A film of April Jones's best friend describing to police when the schoolgirl disappeared was played to Mold Crown Court . Heartbroken: April Jones's parents Paul and . Coral (pictured today) were in court to hear evidence from their daughter's best friend, who said April happily got into a Land Rover - the last time she was seen . The two best friends were playing in . the street when she noticed a man standing by a Land Rover or van. That, . she said, was 'how April got missing'. In her distinct Welsh accent she . added: 'The man didn't take her in the van – she got into the van, . having a happy face,  she had. 'She wasn't upset. She didn't say she . was going to go in it. She wasn't crying – she was happy. I don't know . why she wanted to go because her mum and dad told her not to get into . cars...' The seven-year-old's testimony was . originally given to police the day after  five-year-old April . disappeared in October last year. It was filmed and played to the trial . at Mold Crown Court yesterday. Then she gave evidence by live video link . from an undisclosed location 80 miles away in Aberystwyth. She offered Minty a drink from a plastic bottle, put her chin in her hands, and waited for questions from the court. Suspect: Mark Bridger arrives in court (left), and the jury heard more evidence claiming it was him (right) who abducted and murdered April last October . Evidence: April's seven-year-old friend was later questioned by video link, and was asked to draw the vehicle and person she believed took her friend . In different circumstances, she might . have been any schoolgirl suddenly asked to describe to a teacher what . she did over the weekend. She laughed, fidgeted, played with her hair . and munched on a packet of crisps. But the testimony she gave to a court . yesterday marked a key stage in the trial – and dramatically . contradicted the account given by April's killer. Former slaughterman Mark Bridger . claims he accidentally ran April over, drove off with her dead or dying . in his Land Rover, then panicked and lost all recollection of what he . did with her. Yesterday, out of sight of the seven-year-old, he fixed the court video screen with a gaze and muttered to himself in the dock. Not once did the jury of nine women . and three men hear the child witness say she had seen  her best friend . run over. In her recorded interview, the girl sat on a sofa with a toy . bunny called Mr Bumble on her lap. She was asked by a policewoman what happened. 'We were just playing until the man . came,' she said. 'We were going to go home because it was a little bit . dark. I said, “April come on!” ' Upsetting: April Jones was shown on CCTV inside her local leisure centre after going swimming. The time shows almost 5.30pm and within two hours she had disappeared . When she turned round, however, she saw April with the man. She explained she recognised the . vehicle because she had seen two friends in it before. The children she . named were the children of Mark Bridger, the jury has heard. April's parents would never have let her get into the van with anyone, she said. But she saw the man talking to April then watched her get in. 'She got in through the driver's way,' she said. 'The two back doors were locked. April tried to open them, . she did, and it wouldn't work. She climbed over and climbed into the . back seat. Then the Land Rover drove off.' Sketch: Murder suspect Mark Bridger lowers his head in the dock, where he is using headphones to help him follow proceedings . A few minutes later April's brother . came running towards her and said it was time for April to go home. 'Then I said what happened. I gave April's bike to him, and got my bike, . and he went back and told his mum. My mum called the police, she did.' The witness, who cannot be named because of her age, asked police at one stage: 'Can I go and see my mum?' After a break she returned to draw the . vehicle, adding a 'stick man' to show where the person she saw was . standing. She wrote' Land Rover' on the vehicle she had drawn. Footage: A camera at the local Tuffins garage spotted Bridger's car, which may have contained April at the time and may have been seen by April's best friend, the court has heard . Hunt: Police launched Britain's biggest ever search after April Jones disappeared, but she has never been found . Trial: The seven-year-old appeared at Mold Crown Court (pictured) via video link, alongside her favourite toys . Lounge: This is Mark Bridger's living room, where forensics found blood and bone fragments, a room which was shown to jurors . Visit: Jurors arrive by coach at the home of Mark Bridger, Mount Pleasant in Ceinws, Mid Wales, on the third day of his trial for the abduction and murder of April Jones. it is surrounded by trees, outbuildings and a river runs down its left side . From time to time the girl appeared live on screen to be asked if she wanted a break from watching her recorded evidence. She wore a pink cardigan and a white . headband in her long dark hair, and sounded considerably more grown up . than she did in her interview, despite the fact that only seven months . had passed. The judge, Mr Justice Griffith . Williams, introduced himself with a wave and explained he was not . wearing a wig in case she did not like it. The 68-year-old former Royal Welch . Fusiliers lieutenant sported a plain grey suit but kept his  judicial . collar so that she could identify him. Next it was time for her to speak to . the barrister who introduced himself as 'the one in the orange tie' – . Brendan Kelly QC, defending Bridger. The court has been told Bridger . claims the seven-year-old's account is a 'fabrication' and 'utterly . untrue'. In cross examination, she was asked if . she saw April 'off her bike and lying on the floor very near to where . the Land Rover was'. No, she said. 'She was talking but she was standing up when she was talking to the man.' The girl said she did not see  him . bending down and did not see April on the floor, adding: 'The  man . didn't carry her into the  front seat.' Bridger, 47, denies abduction, murder and perverting the course of justice. The trial continues.

An army ranger was killed in a freak parachute accident after the cords became wrapped around his neck during a routing training jump in Georgia. Pfc Christopher Dona, 21, was dragged 350ft by his parachute after the wind caught it as he prepared to land at Fort Stewart in Savannah. Members of his regiment rushed to the ranger's aid, cutting away the cords and harness that had wrapped round his neck, but they were unable to revive him after the accident on Thursday afternoon. Accident: Pfc. Christopher P. Dona. The U.S. Army Ranger killed in an apparent parachuting mishap . 'We're not sure what caused the . parachute to do this,' Lieutenant Colonel Brian DeSantis, the spokesman . for the Rangers, at Fort Benning, said. 'It's something we've never seen . before.' Dona, who had been stationed at Hunter Army Airfield, had been on a routine training exercise. Elite soldiers at the base take part in parachute training jumps several times a year, according to The Journal Times. Exercise: Ranger troops stationed at Hunter Air Base take part in regular parachute jumps for training . 'This was a very routine proficiency jump. It was not part of a training exercise or anything. It was just jumping to practice jumping, something we do routinely. So, this is something that’s out of the ordinary for us,' Lieutenant Colonel DeSantis, who has a long service history with airborne units, said. The army is investigating what caused the accident and whether Dona became tangled up in his harness before or after landing. Inquiry: A spokesman from the Ranger's Fort Benning base says the regiment is investigating the accident . It is possible the ranger was knocked unconscious after landing and then became twisted in his parachute as he was dragged along the ground. 'We don’t have evidence that the parachute malfunctioned, Lieutenant Colonel DeSantis told Savannah Now. 'It’s not a case where the parachute didn’t deploy. We don’t know if the Ranger was knocked unconscious during the descent or when he landed.' Dona served in the 1st Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment based at Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah. He was a combat veteran who returned last month from his first deployment to Afghanistan. 'Chris was an excellent Ranger who consistently displayed great courage and strength - a true warrior,' Lt. Col. Robert J. Harman, the battalion commander, said in a statement. 'He was the kind of Ranger everyone wants by their side in a tough situation.'

The schoolgirl’s three-foot mane takes two hours to style - but she refuses to have it cut. Bohdana, who cites fairy tale character Rapunzel as her inspiration, said: ‘I love my hair because nobody’s hair is as long as mine. Glossy: Inspired by Rapunzel eight-year-old Bohdana's hair is nearly as long as she is . ‘I made the decision to let it grow when I was four. I said: “Mum, I don’t want to cut it anymore.”’ Her mother Olga now has to spend half an hour a day combing and plaiting her daughter’s golden locks so they do not get tangled. But the 39-year-old banker’s biggest chore is washing Bohdana’s hair once every 10 days with a strengthening shampoo and conditioning treatment, which takes two hours. Smiles: Bohdana told her mother that she had made the decision to stop cutting her hair when she was just four-years-old . High maintenance: Her hair takes half an hour of coming each day and takes two hours to wash and dry . Olga, who moved to London from Ukraine last September, said: ‘We don’t use chemicals, we use simple stuff for babies. ‘But letting it dry naturally is impossible. The biggest expense is my time.’ Olga said her daughter’s luscious locks were not as popular in their native Ukraine. ‘But her classmates here got really excited and now Bohdana describes her hair as her “key feature” and tells me not to touch it,’ she said. Strong character: Her mother Olga has said that Bohdana refuses to cut it, but that she hopes one day the eight-year-old will get fed up with the style . ‘She wants to be popular, she wants to be the centre of attention.’ Privately-educated Bohdana, who speaks Ukrainian, Russian and English, said that although some people are jealous of her hair, most people admire her looks.

They looked exactly the same,’ she said. But Olga is hoping the novelty of the attention will soon wear off. She said: ‘Bohdana has a strong character but I’m hoping after some time she’ll say, “I don’t want any more attention mummy.” ‘She will stop at one point, we don’t want her looking ridiculous. She will have to grow up as a normal kid.’","Bohdana Stotska has grown her hair for four years without cutting it .

Ironically, 88 per cent of women polled also said that they thought that confidence, not youth, was the secret of true beauty, despite so few saying that they felt confident about their looks themselves. 'What makes a woman truly beautiful? Confidence,' said one respondent, Michelle Goodall, 36. 'It is reaching that point in life when you accept what you’re given and celebrate it.' Lacking confidence: One in two British women are not happy with what they see in the mirror . 'There are a whole swathe of women who are not obsessed by ageing or looks but at the same time just want to look the best they can,' added another, Helen Williams, 38. The survey and focus group was conducted on behalf of organic skincare brand, Pai, which is also participating in the government-led campaign to encourage women to feel better about the way they look and conducting an Age Confidence campaign of its own. 'As a 37 year old woman, I resent being told my days of looking and feeling my best are numbered, and that I should trolley-dash my way around my local beauty hall to ""save"" myself from lines and wrinkles,' said Pai Skincare founder, Sarah Brown. 'Age Confidence is an antidote to anti-ageing quick fixes, and encourages women to take a healthier approach to both their skin and their self-image. 'Rather than looking ten years younger, out research shows women's real beauty ambition is to look and feel fantastic in the skin they're in. 'It's time brands started to celebrate beauty at every age, and help build rather than break down healthy self-images with positive beauty messages.' Ageing beautifully: Dame Helen Mirren and Dame Judi Dench have both embraced growing older . The Government's Body Confidence campaign was launched as part of the Coalition's 'create a fairer and more equal society' policy, and aims to widen the definition of beauty represented inmainstream culture to include all ages, shapes, sizes and ethnicities. Jo Swinson, Minister for Women and Equalities, and the MP in charge of the government plan, said: 'There is evidence to suggest that women over 40 experience high levels of dissatisfaction with their weight and bodies in comparison to their younger years. 'That's a huge, and largely hidden, reservoir of distress that we need to understand more fully and take action on more effectively. 'I want to question the veneration of 'eternal youth' that dominates the beauty industry, and highlight the negative influence it has on women’s self-image – particularly with regards to ageing,' added Brown. 'Together, both campaigns show that it’s time the beauty industry and regulatory bodies unite to make marketing more responsible and work towards building healthy self-images rather than destroying them.'

An IT specialist is suing for £150,000 claiming an accident at work has left him with unique disabilities preventing him from texting or using other gadgets. Isaak Alpman says he has been left with a 'misshapen right index finger', amongst other disabilities, which have seen him go from working at the forefront of the computer world to being unable to use a normal mouse and keyboard. The 59-year-old says his injuries are so bad he cannot get work and even has to get his son to send text messages on his behalf. Proceedings: A computer expert is suing at the High Court for £150,000 after a fall at work injured his finger, preventing him from texting and using gadgets . Mr Alpman, of Rochester, Kent, claims he suffered his affliction when he fell down a flight of stairs while working in the computer server room at the West London headquarters of vintage and collectibles dealer, the Music and Goods Exchange Ltd, in April 2011. He has now issued a High Court writ claiming damages from the company of up to £150,000, on the basis that the staircase where the alleged accident took place was 'unsafe' and breached Health and Safety at Work regulations. In the writ, Mr Alpman's barrister, Gavin Argent, says that the accident happened on April 7 2011 as the IT specialist was climbing the 'steep' first floor stairs to the server room at his employer's HQ. 'He tripped on the staircase, twisted to the right, hit the wall on the right side and fell backwards down the staircase, hitting his head and sustaining personal injuries,' the barrister said. 'The staircase was narrow, old and worn, making it unsafe, and furthermore the hand rail to the left of the staircase was dangerous and unusable because running the length of the stair rail was a live electric cable. 'Mr Alpman was unable to grab hold of the handrail in order to prevent his fall down the stairs,' the barrister adds. Claim: Isaak Alpman's fall down some stairs means he struggles to use a mouse or keyboard (posed by model) Mr Alpman suffered injuries to his right shoulder, knee, hands and spine and is now said to be 'at a disadvantage on the open labour market and disabled. 'He was dismissed by the defendant within a month of the accident and has been unable to work or find work since...he is unable to get another job in IT because, when he discloses his injuries, he is rejected,' the barrister claims. He goes on to describe Mr Alpman's injuries which have led to his trouble with technology, the foremost of which is his problem with his index finger. 'He has developed carpal tunnel syndrome since the incident. His right index finger has become misshapen. He is unable to use a computer mouse and standard keyboard. Text messages are sent by his son on his behalf,' Mr Argent states. 'He is unable to lift or raise his arm on the right side above waist level. He cannot carry anything in his right hand and is now unable to write with that hand. He is right handed.' The company's defence to the action was not available from the court, and the allegations in the writ have yet to be tested in evidence before a judge.","Isaak Alpman has 'misshapen index finger', making gadget use difficult .

There was a time when the prospect of Germans crossing the English Channel at speed might have been a source of some alarm. But today rail passengers on both sides of the water will be celebrating Germany’s Deutsche Bahn receiving permission to run its 200mph trains at ‘blitz’ or lightning speed through the Channel Tunnel. It will get travellers from Berlin to London in four and a half hours – and vice versa. A German ICE high speed train coming out of the Channel Tunnel on its test run in 2010 . Experts predict the extra trains and competition from the nation most renowned for making its railways run on time will result in cheaper fares and a better deal for passengers. It will add four million passengers to the 10 million who already use the rail-link ‘Chunnel’. The decision follows three years of negotiation and a trial run of a 200mph German bullet train in October 2010. It will lead to direct services between Germany and Holland and London with connections across the country. The aim is to run regular services between London's St Pancras station and Frankfurt in Germany, as well as Amsterdam in Holland. Experts say the competition could also mean lower fares with a one way trip to Germany costing as little as £39 to £49. The decision was welcomed by Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin who is in favour of the move. The Intercity Express Train, one of Germany's most modern superfast trains, which will be continuing to expand across the continent . Announcing the new deal, Eurotunnel said: ‘After three years of detailed study, the Intergovernmental Commission has granted Deutsche Bahn an operating certificate to run passenger services through the Channel Tunnel.’ It said: ’We believe that this long awaited decision will considerably enhance exchanges between the United Kingdom and northern Europe (Germany, Holland) and will over time add between 3 and 4 million new passengers per year to the 10 million already using the existing high speed passenger services.’ A Eurotunnel spokesman said: ‘This new chapter requires no additional investment as adjustments to the timetable and modifications to the paths through the Tunnel will suffice to accommodate the new traffic.’ He said: ‘This increase in the choice of services offered by railway operators is a measure of the improvement in the transport sector as it brings major benefits to passengers. Jacques Gounon, chairman and chief . executive officer of Groupe Eurotunnel SA said: ‘Twenty years after the . start of commercial services, the authorities have finally opened the . Channel Tunnel to all. ‘This . is wonderful news for the millions of passengers in northern Europe who . can now use this most environmentally friendly means of transport to . travel to London’. The Germans first made their pitch for a cross-channel train in October 2010 when they sent a trial 200-mph German bullet-train on a slow-speed dry run trial for a new direct cross-channel link. The German 'Inter City Express' train . bearing the initial letters 'ICE' adorned as a red, white and blue Union . Flag, aims to replace passenger jets as the main transport to Germany's . financial capital and the Rhineland. The plan is for three services a day in . each direction - each carrying 888 passengers in 16 coaches - on a new . generation German cross-channel bullet train that will put the people of . Cologne closer in travelling time to the British capital than they are . to their own capital, Berlin. Two high-speed trains - one German, left, one French - in Paris. The TGV high speed train and ICE Inter City Express was a significant collaboration between rival rail giants, France's SNCF and Deutsche Bahn . In Brussels, the trains will split, with eight carriages carrying 444 passengers heading to Rotterdam and then Amsterdam. The other eight carriages will head to Cologne and then Frankfurt. Deutsche Bahn officials said the journey time from Cologne to London would be under four hours - less than the time it takes to get to Berlin, around four and a half hours: 'Passenger can choose which capital they prefer - yours or ours,' said one DB official. It also mean business travellers and tourists can relax for longer in their seats or work via wi-fi rather  than enduring the hassle of airline check-in, security and trips to and from the airport. It is the latest step in the plan to create high speed rail links across Britain and Europe - from Edinburgh to Madrid and Manchester to Marseilles. But while trains will hit 200mph on the Continent, tunnels on the UK side of the Channel mean high speed trains are restricted in many places to 140mph. The German challenger was the first all-new train to use the Tunnel since it opened. German railway giant Deutsche Bahn has already been busy buying up a number of UK train operators and has now set its sight on taking on the airlines and arch rival Eurostar to win  passenger services between the UK and the Continent. It aims to slash the train travelling time from Central London to Frankfurt, nicknamed 'Bankfurt' in Germany because it is the nation's major financial centre, from around six hours to less than five hours. This competes with the door-to-door four and a half hours needed to fly there, once travel to the airport, check-in time and the 1 hour 30 minute flight time are put together. Launching the plan at St Pancras in October 2010, Deutsche Bahn boss Dr Ruediger Grube said it marked ' a new era' of train travel adding: 'Europe is becoming a small place. 'Every day there are around 50 flights between the Greater London area and the region of Frankfurt and the Rhineland.' The City Night Line is a joint venture combining Deutsche Bahn and Eurostar trains to Paris for a service to the Tirol as part of Deutsche Bahn's expansion across the continent . Until now that was out of reach of the railways, he said: 'But times change. Thanks to new railway lines, new high speed trains, and new transport policies, we will be able to share in that market.' Mr Grube said: 'Three pairs of trains will connect Frankfurt and London via Cologne, Brussels, and Lille, with one train running in each direction in the morning, at lunchtime, and in the evening. 'This will also be the first time that Amsterdam and Rotterdam have a direct connection with London.' The high speed German-built Inter City Express (ICE) trains have to pass stringent safety tests to pass through the Channel Tunnel - including evacuations. Their arrival nevertheless highlights how far international relations have moved. Some 73 years ago, at the height of the Battle of Britain, the narrow strip of water comprising the Channel was all that separated Britain from German invasion. Today the nation which was defeated is now running much of Britain's railways. Last year state-owned Deutsche Bahn said it would delay the launch of direct train services between London and Frankfurt to at least 2016, compared with initial plans to start the route in 2013. Cross-Channel train services are currently operated by Eurostar, which is majority-owned by French state-owned SNCF. Eurotunnel gets a fee for each train passing through the tunnel linking Dover to Calais. The announcement comes as ministers are embroiled in a ‘jobs for British workers’ row after confirming that Germany’s Siemens had won a controversial £1.6bn contract to build trains for the Thameslink line. The decision is a huge blow to Derby-based Bombardier, one of three major employers in the city and the last British-based train-maker. Canadian-owned Bombardier had warned ministers it needed the Thameslink contract to safeguard the future of the factory – which survived a zeppelin airship raid in 1916. It announced 1,400 job cuts at Derby plant when it was first announced that it had lost the deal. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘This will be a death blow to Derby’s economy’.","Berlin to London rail service will take only four and a half hours .

With up to 3,000 prisoners each, they would be twice the size of the existing largest institution in the country, 1,600 place HMP Oakwood near Wolverhampton. Changing the prison system: 'Old and inefficient' prisons like Victorian-era Wormwood Scrubs could be closed down . Mr Lockyer claims the plan could save more than £600 million a year on completion - 20 per cent of the prison budget and equivalent to around 9 per cent of the MoJ's entire departmental budget. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said it was 'absolutely right' to try to find ways of reducing the cost of the country's 'old and inefficient' prison estate. The idea of opening huge jails has proved hugely controversial in the past - with critics claiming they would be more likely to suffer from riots. But Mr Lockyer said the new prisons would be 'materially different' from Labour's 2007 plans for Titan prisons, which would have held 2,500 inmates. They would have a campus-style design with space for education and employment. Mr Lockyer, who was governor at two Victorian-era prisons, said: 'We are busting the myth that small is beautiful when it comes to prisons. In fact, newer prisons outperform older ones, regardless of their size. Largest: Oakwood prison near Wolverhampton currently holds the most inmates in the country . 'We need to build larger, newer facilities that use the most up-to-date technology to monitor inmates. 'New hub prisons will not only reduce reoffending and improve safety - they will also deliver vast financial savings and better value for money for the taxpayer.' Mr Lockyer said the construction of the new prisons could be financed through public sector borrowing, private finance or development finance and claims the savings would amount to around £10 billion over a 25-year repayment period. He said the Government should focus on cutting the cost per prisoner, rather than simply closing prisons and reducing prisoner numbers. The report shows that a quarter of prisons are Victorian or older while a further quarter were built in the 1960s and 1970s, often to poor standards and designs with poor materials. Reform: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said it was 'absolutely right' to investigate ways of reducing the cost of our old prisons . It recommends locating new prisons on brownfield sites near main transport routes and to hold more prisoners as close to home as possible. The prisons should be designed using cutting-edge architecture, with technologies such as biometric security systems, he added. Mr Lockyer also recommends allowing private providers to compete on a level playing field with the public sector to manage and run the new establishments. Among the prisons recommended for closure by Mr Lockyer are Brixton, Feltham, Holloway, Pentonville, Wandsworth and Wormwood Scrubs. Last night, Mr Grayling said: 'The report is absolutely right to highlight that much of our prison estate is old and inefficient, and that we need to bring its cost down. Upgrade: Old prisons such as Wormwood Scrubs in London may be replaced with cutting-edge architecture and technologies like biometric security systems . 'We are constantly reviewing it to ensure that it meets the needs of the prison population and provides the best value for money for the taxpayer. 'I never want the Courts to be in a position where they cannot send a criminal to prison because there is no place available. So we have to move as fast as we can to replace the older parts of our prison system. 'That's why we are moving ahead with immediate plans for new capacity and developing proposals for the next generation of prisons.' But Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: 'With crime falling and community sentences and treatment to tackle addictions working to reduce reoffending, it would be a gigantic mistake to pour taxpayers' money down a super-sized, big brother prison building drain. 'There is scope to close some outdated prisons and reinvest the money saved into effective community solutions to crime.'","'Superjails' would be twice as large as 1,600-place Oakwood prison .

He works as part of the team designing, making and maintaining the famous miniaturised versions of British life. Scroll down for video . A big man: David Ellis (pictured) is the craftsman who has created all the miniatures at Babbacombe Model village in Torquay, Devon, since it opened in April 1963 . Then and now: Mr Ellis working on a house he built in the 1970s and (right) today still crafting buildings as beautifully as ever .

In fact the 65-year-old is the longest serving member of staff and is still going strong. And he still enjoys it, saying: 'Every day is different. 'Techniques have changed from when I started. 'We use more fibre glass than wood now. 'But it's still about making accurate scaled models and that's where the skill is.' Bygone era: David (circled) among other staff in 1984.

He said: 'I had to learn how to thatch to do it from a local master thatcher.' Magic: The modeller stands at the heart of the village's own version of Stonehenge with its own tiny pagans .

Everything is 1/12th scale and there are more than 400 models including hamlets and harbours  -  as well as sound-effects of cows mooing, church bells ringing and even little loos flushing for the 13,000 tiny people. The 'village' was born 40 years ago when Thomas Dobbins, who trained as an architect, decided to recreate the quintessential English rural community. The settlement has since grown in area, if not in scale, into a miniature district with an assortment of architectural styles, farms, businesses, working watermills and railways  -  and even a lake stocked with koi carp.","David Ellis has worked at Babbacombe Model village in Torquay, Devon, since it opened in April 1963 .

Documentary-makers in Germany have claimed that legalising prostitution has turned the country's capital Berlin into 'Europe's biggest brothel.' Sex trade laws were radically liberalised by the German government in 2002 but a documentary called Sex - Made In Germany estimates that one million men pay for sex every day. The film was based on two years of research captured using hidden cameras and explores Berlin's world of 'flat-rate' brothels where customers pay €49 (£42) for as much sex as they want. Sex for sale: Around a million men are paying for sex every day in Germany according to a new television documentary. Hamburg's Reeperbahn red light district is pictured. Laws were originally relaxed in the hope that they would offer a degree of protection to prostitutes who now have access to health insurance and benefits. But more than a decade on the changes in the law have brought criticism from those who claim that they have simply made it easier for traffickers to force foreign women into prostitution, according to The Guardian. It is thought that around two thirds of the country's 400,000 sex workers come from abroad. But according to figures from the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) the number of reported cases of sexual trafficking in 2011 in Germany - 636 - were down by a third on a decade earlier. Red light districts have also become much more prominent in Germany's major cities - there are between 3,000 and 3,500 established brothels in Germany and the trade is now big business. Big business: There are an estimated 400,000 sex workers in Germany and around two thirds of those are said to be from abroad . According to public services union Ver.di, some 14.5billion Euros is accrued by the sex trade in Germany annually. Roshan Heiler, head of counselling at the Aachen branch of women's rights organisation Solwodi, is unsurprised by the numbers of men paying for sex because it is so cheap and they won't get prosecuted. Defending the laws, Monika Lazar, of the Alliance 90/Greens party, told The Guardian: 'Prostitution is still socially stigmatized, but the law is helping to strengthen the position of prostitutes and ensuring women and men are better protected.'","Germany's prostitution laws were relaxed by the government back in 2002 .

Mark Slater, of The Leys in Cambridge, said a guest speaker with experience of the industry could be a good influence on pupils. He said it was now important to 'empower' students with good judgment to ensure they understand that pornography can be addictive and damaging.

Britain is set to enjoy a tropical heatwave this week which will bring the hottest day of the year so far. But while temperatures are set to reach 28C (82F) on Wednesday, the Met Office has warned that this warmth will not come with 'wall-to-wall sunshine'. Instead there will be thunder storms and widespread cloud, causing sticky and humid conditions. It comes after heavy rain hit large parts of the UK over the weekend, affecting the Queen's Club tennis and the Isle of Wight Festival. Rainy: As spectators cower underneath their umbrellas at the Queen's Club grass court championships in London yesterday, more storms are on the way along with hot temperatures this week . Bad weather: Despite the optimistic sign, festival-goers make their way through the mud at a wet and windy 2013 Isle of Wight Festival over the weekend . Meanwhile in Europe, some parts of France and Spain have seen temperatures reach 42C, and it is hot air from these countries which will make the UK so warm this week. 'This is going to be a warm week and Wednesday will easily be the hottest day of the year so far,' a Met Office spokesman said. 'The warm weather that France and Spain have been experiencing recently is being dragged over Britain. 'We believe that temperatures will be between 26C and 28C, and will feel very warm and humid. 'But it will not be wall-to-wall sunshine, it will be mainly cloudy with a chance of thunder storms.' But by the end of the week Britain's changeable climate will take hold again, with temperatures dropping markedly. 'By the time we get to Thursday it will feel fresher and temperatures will be between 20C and 22C,' the spokesman said. Heatwave: People enjoy the sunny weather at a beach in Gruissan, southern France yesterday, where large parts of France and Spain have had temperatures in excess of 42C . Warm: With the French Alps in the background, children enjoy the hot weather over Europe by jumping into Lake Geneva . It came as the Met Office prepares for a major summit on Britain's climate, after several years of summer floods and droughts, freezing winters and even widespread snow in May this year. Leading meteorologists and scientists will discuss one key issue: is Britain's often terrible weather down to climate change, or just typical? It follows the coldest spring in more than 50 years, as well as droughts and floods in 2012, the freezing winter of 2010 and incredibly widespread snow last month. Forecast: The Met Offices say the UK will heat up this week with temperatures likely reaching 28C on Wednesday . Experts will travel to the forecaster's headquarters in Exeter on Tuesday. Attendees are expected to debate whether the changing weather pattern in the UK, and in northern Europe, is because of climate change or simply variable weather. 'We have seen a run of unusual seasons in the UK and northern Europe, such as the cold winter of 2010, last year's wet weather and the cold spring this year,' a Met Office spokesman said. 'This may be nothing more than a run of natural variability, but there may be other factors impacting our weather. 'There is emerging research which suggests there is a link between declining Arctic sea ice and European climate - but exactly how this process might work and how important it may be among a host of other factors remains unclear.'","Temperatures will reach 28C (82F) across much of Britain on Wednesday .

A fisherman survived for two days trapped 30 metres underwater by managing to breathe from a tiny air bubble in his sunken tugboat in the Atlantic ocean. Harrison Okene, a 29-year-old ship's cook, is the only known survivor from the boat of 12 men, which capsized on May 26, 20 miles off the coast of Nigeria. Mr Okene was left fighting to breathe inside a four-foot high bubble of air in the adjoining toilet and bedroom where he was trapped, with the waters slowly rising around him. Quick-thinking: Ship's cook Harrison Okene, 29, managed to survive for over two days underwater by floating on a mattress in an air bubble . Before closing the cabin door to stop the water coming in, he had seen three dead colleagues in the water. Quick-thinking Mr Okene took two mattresses from the beds and sat on top of them, hoping to stay afloat. 'I was there in the water in total darkness just thinking it's the end,' Mr Okene told Reuters. Although he could not see anything he said: 'I could perceive the dead bodies of my crew were nearby. I could smell them. The fish came in and began eating the bodies. I could hear the sound.' After days soaking in the salt water parts of his skin began peeling away and he was gasping for water as he could not drink the seawater that he was trapped in. South African divers came down to search for any survivors on May 28 and they were stunned to find Mr Okene still alive. Miraculous: Mr Okene was the only survivor from the Jascon-4 tugboat that capsized and sunk in the Gulf of Guinea in heavy seas . Paul McDonald, a member of the rescue crew, said: 'All on board could not believe how cool he was when being rescued. 'The divers put a diving helmet and harness onto him. It was amazing to be part of this rescue.' Mr Okene said: 'I hammered the side of the vessel hoping someone would hear me'. He spent another 60 hours in a decompression chamber where his body pressure was returned to normal. If he had been exposed immediately to the outside air he would have died. Divers have recovered 10 dead bodies and one remaining crew member has not been found. Kurt Glaubitz, a Chevron spokesman, said the boat overturned while towing a Chevron oil tanker in the Gulf of Guinea.","Fisherman was trapped for two days in the pitch dark with no food or water .

A specialist military unit which is able to secure Syria's chemical weapons is to be reinstated by the Ministry of Defence - two years after it was axed as part of budget cuts. The move will be made after US President Barack Obama decided that intervention is necessary in the civil war-ravaged country, with British forces able to join US forces sent to Syria to try and prevent its stockpile of weapons falling into terrorist's hands. The unit was cut in 2011 in a bid to save £129million a year. Reopening: A specialist chemical weapons unit could be reopened by the MoD as Britain considers joining the US and intervening in the Syrian conflict. Chemical weapons have reportedly been used in the bloody civil war . An MoD source said that the unit could be operational again before the end of September, according to The Daily Telegraph. The source told the paper: 'The MoD has been engaged in a very rapid re-think of what Britain is able to do in Syria, and concluded that the lack of a capability would largely prevent active participation in a US ground incursion, or even a post-conflict offer to sort out chemical weapons sites that are vulnerable to terrorists' looting.' The unit will be funded using money from other parts of the defence budget. Two specialist Fuchs NBC vehicles which had been put in storage after the unit was closed are reportedly already being tested and reconditioned at RAF Honnington in Suffolk. The only remaining specialist chemicals unit within UK forces is the RAF Defence Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Wing. Bold move: The move comes after US President Barack Obama made the decision that his country should intervene in Syria . But that unit is described as only having limited collection and analysis capabilities. AN MoD spokesman told the Telegraph that resources to tackle the chemical weapons threat to the UK are constantly being reviewed. Security services see the danger that chemical weapons could fall into the hands of Islamist fighters or extremist allies such as the Iranian-backed Hizbollah as a prime risk. The threat of an attack against Britain using chemical weapons was downgraded in 2010, a year before the specialist unit was scrapped. Warning: Mayor of London Boris Johnson . Mayor of London Boris Johnson has warned that arming Syrian rebels would be 'pressing weapons into the hands of maniacs.' He warned Prime Minister David Cameron that any weapons sent to Syria by the UK could fall into the hands of Al Qaeda. Several leading figures, including Deputy PM Nick Clegg and former head of the Army Lord Dannatt, have warned Mr Cameron to be cautious when considering joining US President Barack Obama in intervening in the bloody civil war being waged in the state. Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Mr Johnson said: This is the moment for a total ceasefire, an end to the madness. 'It is time for the US, Russia, the EU, Turkey, Iran, Saudi and all the players to convene an intergovernmental conference to try to halt the carnage. 'We can't use Syria as an arena for geopolitical point-scoring or muscle-flexing, and we won't get a ceasefire by pressing weapons into the hands of maniacs.' Russian president Vladimir Putin also warned against arming the rebels, saying that if it was a good idea then his country would have already done it. Mr Cameron has been warned that he could face defeat in Parliament if he tries to get MPs' backing to arm the rebels amid growing political opposition to the move. Deputy PM Mr Clegg said that the Government will not arm the rebels as it is not the 'right thing to do' at the moment.","The specialist military unit was closed as part of budget cuts in 2011 .

Watching Blue Peter after school was a rite of passage for generations of children who dreamed of being awarded one of the show's iconic badges. But now the days of learning to make toys and games using ‘sticky-back plastic’ and toilet rolls appear to be on the way out. The numbers watching the show have fallen by two-thirds since it was relegated from BBC1 to the Corporation’s’ dedicated children’s channel CBBC last year. Hugely popular: John Noakes, Valerie Singleton and Peter Purves in the early 1970s . Losing its appeal: The show's current presenters Helen Skelton and Barney Harwood . Blue Peter, which was once watched by eight million and celebrates 50 years of handing out its iconic badge today, now attracts an average audience of just 100,000 viewers. This compares to more than 340,000 who tuned in for each episode in 2012 when it was still being shown on the BBC’s main channel. The decision to drop the much-loved show from BBC1 sparked controversy at the time. Filming had already moved from Television  Centre, the London home  of Blue Peter’s famous garden, to Salford, and critics claimed the show was being watered-down. Last year the programme, which first aired in 1958, was also cut to just one show per week hosted by two presenters. It has previously had four presenters and was broadcast three times a week. Last night, Valerie Singleton, 76, who presented the show for a decade from 1962, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I haven’t understood many of the decisions the BBC has made in the past few years – including the move to Salford. ‘It is sad but all good things  come to an end eventually and maybe it’s finally time to say that Blue Peter has had its day. Mainstay: Former presenter Valerie Singleton, centre, suggested it may be time for Blue Peter to end . ‘Everyone has such fond memories of the show but  I just think kids have got so many other things to distract them these days.’ Peter Duncan, 59, who was a Blue Peter presenter for five years over two spells in the 1980s, added: ‘Blue Peter was the first programme that had this wonderful idea of interaction – it wasn’t about phoning a telephone line to give a quid to Simon Cowell. The show was interacting with children with  its appeals.’ The BBC sparked controversy in December 2011 when it announced that Blue Peter, now presented by Barney Harwood and Helen Skelton, would be aired first on CBBC and then repeated on BBC1 a day later. The Corporation risked further fury by stopping screening repeats on BBC1 altogether last year. Last night a BBC spokeswoman said that only 57,000 children aged six to 12 watched the show when it was aired on BBC1, but now it is screened on CBBC more children in that age group watch it. She said: ‘Far from being in decline, Blue Peter is growing in popularity with children and we’re delighted by its success. ‘And children are finding even more ways to interact with the show – 80,000 visit the website each week and we receive about 2,000 letters and emails every week.’","Show was once watched by eight million - now averages just 100,000 .

Police said the alarm was raised by air traffic controllers at Albenga airport on the Italian Riviera near Savona after it disappeared from radar screens shortly after taking off on Sunday morning and at the same time by a walker who heard the low flying plane and seconds later the sound of a crash. At the time of the accident visibility was said to be poor with the mountains in the area covered in fog and Mr Tyson is thought to have delayed his departure because of the poor weather and had then tried to make the flight after a 'clear window' was forecast. However the plane crashed into the slopes of the mountain near Garessio, 30 miles north of Albenga and walkers further down the mountain reported hearing a loud explosion. Fire fighters and alpine rescue teams were quickly on the scene and the wreckage was found close to a cross that marks the summit of the mountain and which is a popular destination with walkers and climbers. Marshall Matteo Laurilio, of the . paramilitary police in Garessio said: 'The first call we got was from a . member of the public, who had heard a low flying plane and then the . sound of a crash. We then had a call from the airport to see it had . disappeared from the radar screens. Accident: Mr Tyler crashed his his five seater plane into the mountain side in thick fog, and Italian police and air officials are investigating the possibility that the airplane's altimeter was faulty . He added: 'The weather at the time was foggy but there were occasional breaks in the cloud but the plane did not clear the top of the mountain - we are looking at the possibility of a fault with the altimeter as he should not have been that low but at this stage is it too early for certain to say that was the cause. ''The plane had taken off at around 9.30 but it didn't crash until noon so it was flying around for more than two hours - there is also the possibility he may have got lost in the fog. 'Mr Tyson was killed instantly and no-one else was onboard. His body has been taken to a local hospital and the British Embassy in Rome has been informed of what happened. We think he was en route to France to pick up passengers but we are still investigating.'' Marshal Laurilio confirmed the plane's registration as G-CIZZ. Officials at Albenga said the plane had been headed towards Levaldilgi airport near Cuneo but refused to give any further details. The plane was owned by Mr Tyson who lived in Wargrave near Reading, Berkshire. He is the director of the Bonanza Flying Club which is based in Eaton Terrace, Belgravia and company records show him as being with the firm for 19 years, fellow director Nigel Meek could not be reached for comment. Tonight a Foreign Office spokesman said: ''We are aware of the incident and are providing consular assistance to the family.'","British man dead in plane crash near Italian Riviera .

A white van man who dumped a huge pile of waste down a countryside lane has been fined £1,000 after police tracked him down from a McDonald's receipt found among the rubbish. Patrick Lishman, 30, dumped the waste on secluded Washingwell . Lane in Whickham, Tyne and Wear, before driving off. But hidden among the scraps of wood, . plastic bags and old electrical fittings were two McDonald's receipts . which he'd crumpled up and chucked out the window. Fly-tipper Patrick Lishman, pictured left, has been fined £1,000 for dumping waste in a secluded area after workers from Gateshead Council tracked him down from a McDonald's receipt left among the piles of rubbish . Investigators from Gateshead Council found the receipts and, using some old-fashioned detective work, used them to track down Lishman. The receipts, one for a chicken sandwich and fries and another for a sausage and egg mcmuffin and a bacon, egg and cheese bagel, stated the meals had been purchased from a McDonald's on Shearlegs Road in Gateshead. Investigators then trawled through CCTV from the store until they found footage showing Lishman . ordering the meals at the drive-through in his white Ford Transit van which was loaded up . with waste. They then tracked Lishman to his home in Marian Court, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, when Police traced the vehicle registration. The 30-year-old was this week handed a £1,000 fine after admitting fly-tipping - depositing controlled waste without a waste management licence - at Gateshead Magistrates Court. He was also ordered to pay £100 costs plus a £100 victim surcharge. Dumped: Patrick Lishman left this mound of rubbish, including scraps of wood, plastic bags and two McDonald's receipts down a secluded lane in Whickham, Tyne and Wear . Colin Huntington, service director of waste services and grounds maintenance at Gateshead Council, said the authority goes to great lengths to catch up with fly-tippers and other environmental pests. He said: 'The amount of waste dumped was significant. Our investigating team did a great job of tracking down the culprit. 'I hope that this sends out a clear message to anyone who thinks that they can get away with dumping waste illegally. 'Even the smallest of clues can be used to trace those responsible and the consequences can be serious.' Lishman dumped the waste at the side of the country lane on January 16. Investigators were also able to trace evidence in the bags of rubbish back to Durham Prison. Detective work: Investigators found the McDonald's drive-through address on the receipt and tracked down the restaurant's CCTV footage which showed Patrick Lishman buying food from the chain . After contacting the prison they discovered Lishman had been subcontracted for the removal of waste. This is not the first time fly-tippers have been tracked down through their own rubbish. Fly-tipper Scott Hamilton was also caught when he left his personal details in a pile of rubbish. The 21-year-old, from Walker, Newcastle, dumped unwanted furniture in a park and left a note with his personal details among the rubbish. Another fly-tipper Mohammed Javad also dumped refuse along with paperwork that had his details on. Officers traced the waste back to the 41-year-old's store, the Beer and Food Discount Centre on Welbeck road, in Walker, Newcastle.

New York's JFK Airport may deal with some of the fastest planes in the sky, but its runways are at risk from being put out of use by some of the slowest creatures on earth: turtles. The airport is located alongside Jamaica Bay and has been plagued in recent years by turtles, which have started to cross over runways as they attempt to find a nesting ground. During last year’s mating season airport employees had to carry 1,300 turtles off the tarmac to safety.

The turtles have become a slow-moving nuisance to the airport, causing runway closures and delays for passengers. The airport is already running at capacity as it tries to move 47 million passengers every year in and out of the complex swiftly. In an effort to keep the planes running on time and the turtles safe, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey officials are installing piping along runways to keep the turtles out. Tracking: One of 200+ turtles picked up by hand at JFK Airport this month, marked for temporary ID with polish that will soon wash off.

Turtle power: Last year there were 1,600 turtles that had to be carried off the runways to safety. Not only are their lives at risk but a turtle could do serious damage to an aircraft engine . 'We’re trying to find a balance between nature and aviation,' Port Authority spokesman Ron Marsico told the New York Post. 'We don’t want to see the turtles get hurt, and this should keep the airport running smoothly.' The airport will install 4,000 feet of 8-inch plastic piping along the runway 4L which runs closest to the bay. The barrier will apparently come just in time: The Port Authority’s Twitter account recently posted a few photos of 200 turtles that were cleared from the area.","Turtles crawl onto the tarmac at New York's Kennedy airport in search of beaches to lay their eggs .

A new outlandish theory has been proposed to explain how the aircraft carrying Italian fashion heir Vittorio Missoni and five others vanished without a trace from the skies above the Caribbean last Friday. It apparently fell victim to the 'Los Roques Curse', a paranormal phenomenon that has been compared to the notorious Bermuda Triangle which has been blamed for the loss of planes and ships in the Atlantic Ocean for the past 60 plus years. Since the 1990s at least 15 aircraft have crashed or disappeared on the 87 mile journey from the island resort of Los Roques to the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, and now the failure to find Missoni's flight has raised the spectre of the so-called curse again. Cursed?: Venezuela --- Aerial View of Islands in Los Roques National Park where Vittorio Missoni disappeared while on flight from the archipelago to the capital, Caracas . In 2008, 14 people died when a plane making the exact same journey Missoni embarked upon disappeared and no wreckage was ever recovered and only one body ever found according to Volaren Venezuela, a website on civil aviation in the South American country. And to date, four days after his plane went missing, no trace of Missoni has been found. A hotel owner on the archipelago said that the plane, a twin-engine BN-2 Islander built in 1968, was last seen by him entering into a bank of clouds. Venezuela’s civil aviation authority said the aircraft’s last recorded position was 18km south of the Los Roques. Missing: Vittorio Missoni and his wife Maurizia . Castiglioni are feared dead after the aircraft they were flying in went . missing after taking off . from the resort of Los Roques on Friday . Some have questioned whether Missoni fell victim to the so called 'Los Roque Curse' as he attempted to make it to Caracas Some have questioned whether Missoni fell victim to the so called 'Los Roque Curse' as he attempted to make it to Caracas . The Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander aircraft YV-2615, which was reported missing on January 4, 2013, is pictured in this undated handout photo . Some have claimed that like the mysterious Bermuda Triangle, the 'Los Roques Curse' means that unfortunate souls are abducted by aliens, kidnapped by the last remaining residents of Atlantis, or slightly more realistically are hit by massive releases of methane gas from the seafloor. However, like the Bermuda Triangle, which stretches between the Atlantic island, South Florida and Puerto Rico, no evidence has ever been found to back up any theories aside from the incidences of strange vanishings. But, like the Bermuda Triangle, the route from Los Roques to Caracas is heavily traveled and proportionally sees no more disappearances than any other area. However, both regions produce unpredictable storms and the Gulf Stream is particularly fast and turbulent in the case of the Bermuda Triangle. 'There's always some explanation for these things, even if it takes many years to uncover the answer,' Nick Wall, editor of Pilot, told the Guardian. 'Pilots prefer to concentrate on the things that genuinely will help them live longer, such as fuel gauges, weather reports and engine inspections … it is too early to know for sure what caused this latest incident.'

Map of the Atlantic Ocean, showing the southeast United States, Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, with the Bermuda Triangle highlighted . A small plane with 14 people aboard disappeared off the Venezuelan coast en-route to the Los Roques islands in January 2008 - in a mysterious incident similar to that which has affected Vittorio Missoni . In Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind - Scientists searching for extraterrestrials discover the returned aircraft of Flight 19 in the Sonora Desert in Arizona . However, curse or not, at 1.5 million square miles, the Bermuda Triangle dwarfs the area tainted by the hex on the Los Roques. The first written boundaries of the triangle are the eastern seaboard of the United States, San Juan, Puerto Rico and the mid-Atlantic island of Bermuda. However, the United States Board on Geographic Names does not recognise the existence of the area and says that there is no issue with the zone, which is one of the most heavily traveled shipping lanes in the world. Despite all evidence to the contrary, there have been famous disappearances inside the triangle beginning with the loss of the iconic Flight 19. Five TBM Avenger tropedo bombers vanished on December 5th 1945, while flying over the Atlantic after they took off from Fort Lauderdale and were meant to circle back and return after a training flight. While no wreckage was recovered, a tanker off the coast of Florida reported seeing an aerial explosion and then observed a widesprea oil slick while they searched for any survivors. Even though, nothing of the planes was found and their disappearance was featured as a plot device in Steven Spielberg's 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. In the 1977 film, the Oscar winning director imagined that the five aircraft and their pilots were indeed abducted by aliens over the Bermuda Triangle and then returned unharmed to the Sonora Desert in Arizona over 30-years later - unharmed. There is the so called Michigan Triangle in Lake Michigan and the Sargasso Sea. It has been reported that several ships have been found drifting without any crews through the otherwise calm Sargasso Sea.Legend has it that in 1840, the French merchant ship, 'Rosalie' was discovered with her sails unfurled but without any crew aboard.The Devil's Sea, also called the Pacific Bermuda Triangle exists off the coast of Miyake Island, south of Tokyo.Ancient Japanese people believed that dragons lived there and numerous ships and aircraft are supposed to have perished in this otherwise calm sea area.","Italian fashion heir Vittorio Missoni and five other passengers vanished without a trace while flying from the islands of Los Roque to the Venezuelan capital of Caracas on January 4th .

It was a perilous job, with almost half of all dogs destined not to come home. But two female strays employed in the Soviet space programme, Comet and Shutka, proved to be remarkable survivors. Canine cosmonauts: Females Comet, left, and Shutka, right, survived a failed rocket launch in December, 1960 . During a mission, the pair plummeted 125 miles to Earth after their rocket malfunctioned and remained trapped inside for four days in the Siberian wilderness. To the astonishment of the Soviet authorities, they were found alive. Their incredible story, as reported by The Siberian Times, has only just emerged after being kept secret for more than 50 years. On December 22, 1960, the space dogs - who had been picked after surviving a rough life on the streets - were launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome on board a Vostok 1K spacecraft. It was Comet's third space flight, having twice been sent into orbit the previous year. But this launch would prove to be disastrous. The rocket failed to reach orbit after suffering a malfunction in the third stage of the rocket. Armen Gyurdzhian, who was in charge of training the Soviet space dogs, found Comet and Shutka still alive inside the failed rocket capsule . The emergency systems sprung into action and the rocket plunged back to Earth, crashing some 2,200 miles from the launch site. 'At the beginning of the third stage the engine failed,' said Arvid Pallo, a close colleague of Sergei Korolev, the lead Soviet rocket engineer and spacecraft designer. 'The control system gave the order to separate the ship, and according to the calculations it was to be found in Yakutia. 'Was the ship damaged? How did it land after the accident? 'What happened to the dogs that were to be catapulted in their container on Yakutian frost? These were the questions we had no answers for.' In temperatures of minus 40C, a search group from the State Commission was sent to try to find the wreckage. Four days later the remains of the rocket were found near the village of Tura, between the rivers Ognekte and Yukteken. Crucially, the two female dogs remained inside the insulated module due to failure of the ejection system, a fact which saved their lives in the perishing conditions. On Christmas morning, rescuer Armen Gyurdzhian began to open the capsule and could hear quiet barking. 'They were alive despite the most pessimistic forecasts,' he said. Gyurdzhian wrapped the frozen and exhausted animals in his coat and went back to Tura by helicopter. He . described them as being 'in a state half death because of the shock . after crashing down and.... the cold in which they had to spend time . till they were found'. The rocket's ejection system failed, keeping the dogs trapped inside and protecting them from the perishing conditions of the Siberian wilderness . The rocket crashed some 2,200 miles from the launch site where temperatures were minus 40C . Records show Gyurdzhian took them back to Moscow where they were said to be 'feeling good' the next day. The fate of Shutka after returning to Moscow is not known. But Comet was adopted by academic Oleg Gazenko, a specialist in aviation medicine, with whom she lived for 14 years. After her Siberian adventure, she went on to have puppies. 'She was such a cute, fluffy, fair-haired dog with a sharp nose,' he said. 'She was a hero, flying as many as three times - twice in rockets, and a third on board the satellite, the forerunner of the ship which was used for Yuri Gagarin's flight'. The spacecraft's designer Korolev wanted to make the news of Comet and Shutka's faile flight public but was banned from doing so by Soviet officialdom. As a result, their heroic adventure has not been properly recorded in many histories of space animals - until now. Comet was adopted by academic Oleg Gazenko following her adventures and went on to have puppies .","Strays Comet and Shutka were launched into space in December 1960 .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . PUBLISHED: . 19:01 EST, 15 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:02 EST, 15 June 2013 . Free: David Magnan admits killing two women and a man but a court has agreed his release . A 50-year-old Oklahoma man who admitted killed three people has had his death sentence reversed because the murders happened on Native American land, meaning the state lacks the authority to prosecute him. David Magnan's murder convictions were voided by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and he was ordered to be released from death row, where he has been held since 2004. A three-judge panel said they presumed federal authorities would arrest and prosecute Magnan 'given the nature of the crimes and Magnan's admitted guilt'. Attorney General Scott Pruitt's office was reviewing the decision on Friday, a spokesman said. One option is to request a rehearing before all nine members of the Denver-based court. Magnan, who is part of the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux tribes, shot dead three members of the Seminole Nation and injured another tribe member in Seminole County, which Oklahoma has no jurisdiction over. He had been sentenced to death on each murder count and received a life sentence on the remaining count. However, he appealed his conviction, arguing that because the crimes occurred on 'Indian Nation' land, the state had no right to prosecute him. On reservations, however, only federal and tribal laws apply to members of the tribe, unless Congress has ruled otherwise. About 56.2 million acres of land is held in trust for Native Americans under treaties from tribes who had to cede huge tracts of their homeland. The largest of these is the 16 million-acre Navajo Nation Reservation in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah but many reservations cover less than 1,000 acres. The Seminole County reservation, where Magnan shot dead two women and a man, covers 372 acres about 45 miles outside Oklahoma City. Treaty: A tribal dance outside Oklahoma City. American Indian reservations are exempt from state laws, meaning a court had no right to convict David Magnan . The court that agreed Magnan's release agreed the shootings occurred on land that was historically Native American. 'We conclude that the tract, at the time . of Magnan's crimes, was ""Indian country"", and that exclusive . jurisdiction over those crimes rests with the United States,' the . decision stated. The ruling reverses a Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals decision, which ruled the state's criminal jurisdiction was proper. The . federal court's ruling hinges on the history of land that was . originally part of a 200-acre parcel of land allotted to a full-blooded . member of the Seminole Nation at the turn of the last century. The property passed to his heirs, one of whom decided to build a home there. It was in that home that Magnan shot dead two women and a man who had gathered with friends and family to celebrate a birthday. He . had not been at the party, but later drove to the house with two other . men. When he arrived he shot and injured Eric Coley, who had come . outside to speak to him. According to his plea in April 2009, Magnan says he walked into the house where he saw James Howard in a bed near the kitchen. 'When the old man looked up at him, Magnan said “goodbye” and shot him, intending to kill him,' court documents state. Life sentence: David Magnan has been on death row for nearly ten years, after admitting to killing three people . Magnan told the court he went into the bedroom intending to say goodbye to Karen Wolf, but 'when she “got smart” with him, he shot her'. His third victim was Lucilla McGirt, who was in the bed next to Ms Wolf. She died from complications from her gunshot wounds two weeks after the shooting. Because the American Indian heir of the property never obtained approval of the Secretary of Interior to remove restrictions on the part of the land he had bought from his siblings, it is still considered Indian land, a court ruled. Magnan has been held on death row at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, but if a federal court arrests him and finds him guilty he is less likely to be given the death sentence, according to OK News. Although his conviction has been . overturned, Magnan must remain in prison until the court issues its . mandate, which can take 21 days unless the state asks for postponement.","Sioux tribe member held on death row has conviction overturned .

A Texas teen who emancipated herself from her parents in February over fears they were pressurizing her to have an adoption is back living with her mom just four months later and awaiting the birth of her son. High school junior Reagan - who requested her surname wasn't used - took her parents to court in Harris County, Texas, to sever parental rights after they argued over whether she should have abortion. The trouble started last summer when Reagan met a boy called Evan Burnside and the two 16-year-olds quickly became inseparable. Courting: High school junior Reagan (left) took her parents to court and won the right to be emancipated from them in February. She then married her 16-year-old boyfriend Evan (right) Family: For several months Reagan broke off all contact with her parents and lived with Evan and his family. But just two weeks ago Reagan and Evan moved out of the Burnsides' home and back in with her mom . Expectant father Evan Burnside, 16, and his pregant wife Reagan have moved in with her mom ahead of the birth if their son in September . Sensing a developing relationship, Reagan's mother, Denise Koen, talked to her daughter about sex and birth control. But Reagan stopped taking her pills and soon discovered she was pregnant. Her parents, who are divorced, were worried that their daughter was going to jeopardize her future if she became a teen mom and so they claim they gave their daughter three options – abortion being only one of them. Afraid her parents might force her to terminate her pregnancy, Reagan sought support from Evan's family. Vows: The young couple got married and two weeks ago moved in with her mom - they are expecting a boy in September . Evan and his mom Jaime Burnside appeared in court in February as part of the process which Reagan obtained a temporary restraining order against her parents . I was furious with both of them,’ she told ABC’s ‘20/20.’ ‘I wasn't trying to be a stubborn teenager.’ His mother, Jaime Burnside, contacted a local pro-life organization called the Texas Center for the Defense of Life. The organization recommended that Reagan obtain a temporary restraining order against her parents and then helped build a case for why she should be granted emancipation from her parents. The case alleged that Denise Koen kept her daughter home from school, threatened to 'slip' her abortion medication and said she was 'making the biggest mistake of her life.' It . was alleged that her father, Jeff Koen, sent her a text to say that she needed 'an ass . whoopin'. The girl's parents denied in court records all allegations. The . agreement reached stipulated that her parents would not threaten her with . physical force, and would return the teen's car, pay her cell phone bill . and pay half of her health insurance. Fast-moving: Two weeks ago Evan (pictured) and his 16-year old wife moved in with her mom and they are expecting a boy in September . Reagan: The teenage daughter who emancipated herself from her parents because they had a difference of opinion over her teen pregnancy. Was there a better option? 'Right now it's a victory for life,' attorney Texas Center for Defense of Life Stephen Carey at the time. 'And . we're glad that they stood up for the right to life and that they . recognized, our client recognized that her child had the right to live . and she wanted to protect that.' Reagan's parents believed their daughter was being exploited by the pro-life group to promote its anti-abortion agenda, but lost the case and so signed an agreement to allow her to marry Evan - thus emancipating her from them. For several months Reagan broke off all contact with her parents and lived with Evan and his family. But just two weeks ago Reagan and Evan moved out of the Burnsides' home and back in with her mom . 'They made the choice to move back to my home,' Denise Koen told '20/20'. 'I know we're going to have to take everything slowly, but it's such a blessing. I'm really, really pleased that she's back.'

Sue Thompson, 40, was so afraid of getting her 27-stone frame stuck in an aeroplane seat that she spent years avoiding her family’s requests for a foreign holiday. However, Mrs Thompson, who dropped ten dress sizes to weigh a healthy 11 stone, can now jet off on her first holiday with husband, Shaun, and daughter, Jessica-Ray, 15. Scroll down for video . Sue Thompson, 40, shrank from an obese 27 stone to a healthy 11 stone. She also dropped ten dress sizes to go from a size 32 to a size 12. She has been crowned Slimming World's Slimmer of the Year . She was so heavy (left) that she once cracked a sunbed but she says that when she was younger she was not worried about her weight and that embarrassing events like this did not motivate her to lose weight (right) Mrs Thompson, who left her job to work for Slimming World as a regional advisor, said that she had lived with being large her whole life but had never felt any worse for it, despite her weight often leading to some embarrassing situations. She said: ‘I knew I wasn’t one of the skinny girls at school but it never affected me when it came to friends or boyfriends and I wasn’t bullied or anything like that. ‘As I got older I started to gain more weight but even embarrassing situations, like the time I cracked a sunbed at a tanning salon, didn’t motivate me to lose weight. ‘It changed when I had Jess, I hated the idea that I might be an embarrassment to her or Shaun. ‘They never said anything and I know they loved me whatever my size but I always worried about how my weight impacted on them.’ Mrs Thompson, from Durham, spent years making excuses not to attend social occasions because she was afraid of embarrassing her husband, and avoided parents' evenings in case other mothers thought she was a bad parent. Mrs Thompson says she was motivated to lose weight by the birth of her daughter, Jessica Ray, 15. She was so embarrassed by her weight that she avoided parents' evenings for fear people would think her a bad mother . Mrs Thompson says that she does not consider herself to be on a diet now - she just ditched the takeaways and only eats fresh, home-cooked food . A turning point came when she realised her size also had implications for her long-term health and dying prematurely became a real concern. She said: ‘I’d sort of accepted that being overweight was my fate. I genuinely believed that my weight would be what killed me – which is scary looking back now because I was only 37. ‘I used to go to bed at night and wonder if that might be the night I didn’t wake up.’ As a result, Mrs Thompson joined a slimming club in March 2010 in a bid to lose weight and save her life. She said: ‘I was totally embarrassed. I was terrified I’d be too big for the scales and even made my friend . check with the consultant first, and I worried I’d be the biggest person . there. ‘I probably was . the biggest but it didn’t matter, everyone was different shapes and . sizes but we were all in the same boat and in it together.’ Mrs Thompson used to be too afraid of getting stuck in an aeroplane seat to go on foreign holidays. She is now looking forward to taking her daughter, Jessica-Ray (left), on the family's first trip abroad . Mrs Thompson was worried that her weight would eventually kill her. She feared that one night she would go to sleep and not wake up so she felt that she needed to join a slimming club to save her own life . Mrs Thompson ditched the takeaways and ate only fresh food cooked at home. She said: ‘I always say I’m not on a diet, I just eat healthily now. ‘I’ve got a completely different relationship with food. It used to be a battle, but now I know how to eat healthily and that I can still have treats if I want them so there’s nothing to fight anymore. ‘If I want a treat I have it, but . I’ve found that a lot of the time you only want it because you think you . can’t or shouldn’t have it.’ Mrs Thompson lost 10st in 12 months and was 15st lighter by the time her 40th birthday came around in October 2012. Her weight fell from 27st 8lb to 11st 5½lb and her dress size shrank from 32 to a 12. Mrs Thompson says that when she attended her first Slimming World Class she was terrified she would be the heaviest person there and that she would break the scales . She said that losing the weight has completely changed her life. ‘People often don’t recognise me and say that I look like a new person, I feel like one too. At T in the Park someone even described me as a cougar, I couldn’t believe they meant me! ‘Three years ago I never dreamed that I’d be able to lose the weight, so it’s hard to believe I’m not only half the size I was but that I have a whole new career and so much to look forward to. ‘Life really has begun at 40 for me and I can’t wait to get stuck in! When I went to bed I used to worry whether I’d wake up or not, now I find it hard to sleep because I’m thinking about all of the exciting things I’ve got planned. ‘And winning Consultant Slimmer of the Year 2013 is just the icing on the cake!’","Sue Thompson, 40, dropped from an obese 27 stone, to a healthy 11 stone .

In a short briefing from the White House press room, President Barack Obama called Monday's bombings near the finish line of the Boston Marathon 'a heinous and cowardly act, and given what we now know about what took place, the FBI . is investigating it as an act of terrorism.' With flags across the country flying at half-staff, Obama leveled his sharpest words yet about the attacks that killed three people and left at least 173 injured, some gravely. 'Any time bombs are used to target innocent civilians, it is an act of terror, he said.' 'What we don't yet know, however,' he added, 'is who carried out this attack or why, whether it was planned by a terrorist organization, foreign or domestic, or whether it was the act of a malevolent individual.' 'We will find whoever harmed our citizens and bring them to justice,' Obama said in closing. 'We also know this: the American people will not be terrorized.' Scroll down for video . President Obama uncorked his strongest words yet about the Boston Marathon bombings, assuring Americans that 'any time bombs are used to target innocent civilians, it is an act of terror' The hometown Boston Globe called the two bomb blasts, which went off 12 seconds apart near the Boston Marathon's finish line, 'Marathon Terror' He praised the 'exhausted runners who kept running to the nearest hospital to give blood, and those who stayed to tend to the wounded, some tearing off their own clothes to make tourniquets. The first responders who ran into the chaos to save lives. The men and women who are still treating the wounded at some of the best hospitals in the world, and the medical students who hurried to help, saying ""When we heard, we all came in."" The priests who opened their churches and ministered to the hurt and the fearful. And the good people of Boston who opened their homes to the victims of this attack and those shaken by it.' 'If you want to know who we are, what America is, how we respond to evil,' Obama said, 'that’s it. Selflessly. Compassionately. Unafraid.' On Monday the president avoided using the words 'terror,' 'terrorist' or 'terrorism,' leaving a White House official to tell reporters after his prepared statement that the federal government was, in fact, treating the carnage in Boston as a terrorist act. But less than 24 hours later, the word is firmly in the presidential lexicon. And U.S. lawmakers joined - or perhaps led - the chorus. The second of two explosions rocked the last 1050 yards of the Boston Marathon course, sending shrapnel into the crowd, severing limbs, and ending lives . 'My understanding is that it's a terrorist incident,' California Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein was quick to say on Monday. She chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, that committee's vice chairman and ranking Republican, said that 'as the evidence mounts that this was a . terrorist attack, our intelligence and law enforcement agencies must do . whatever is necessary to find and interrogate those responsible so we . can prevent similar attacks.' One of their counterparts in the House of Representatives, Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, told reporters that the attacks in Boston had 'all the hallmarks of an act of terrorism, but we do not know for sure who did it.' House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Ed Royce offered his sympathies 'to victims of the terrorist attack in Boston as well as to their families.' Maine Senators Susan Collins and Angus King said that initial reports suggests that the bombs 'bear the hallmarks of a terrorist attack.' A victim of the first explosion is helped on the sidewalk of Boylston Street, after two devices were detonated near the finish line of the 117th Boston Marathon . Obama's reticence to refer to attacks . on American soil as 'terrorist' activities was brought into sharp focus . during his 2012 re-election campaign, when Republican challenger Mitt . Romney chastised him during a debate for refusing to call the Sept. 11, . 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya an act of terror. The president, . backed by debate moderator and CNN chief political correspondent . Candy Crowley, insisted that he had in fact called the attack a . terrorist act in a speech during the day following the Benghazi assault. CBS . News correspondent Steve Kroft, however, had interviewed the president . on the day he gave that speech and asked him why he 'went out of your . way to avoid the use of the word terrorism in connection with the Libya . attack.' Obama responded that it was 'too early to know exactly how this came about [or] what group was involved.' CBS . kept the interview out of public view until the night before Election . Day, long after the debate confrontation had cemented in many Americans' minds the idea that Obama never expressed reluctance to declare that . 'terrorists' attacked Americans in Benghazi. As with he Benghazi situation, the White House has promised a continuing series of briefings throughout the length of the investigation. Good morning, everybody.  I've just been briefed by my national security team, including FBI Director Mueller, Attorney General Holder, Secretary Napolitano, and my Counterterrorism and Homeland Security Advisor Lisa Monaco, on the attacks in Boston.  We continue to mobilize and deploy all appropriate law enforcement resources to protect our citizens, and to investigate and to respond to this attack.  Obviously our first thoughts this morning are with the victims, their families, and the city of Boston.  We know that two explosions gravely wounded dozens of Americans, and took the lives of others, including a 8-year-old boy.This was a heinous and cowardly act.  And given what we now know about what took place, the FBI is investigating it as an act of terrorism.  Any time bombs are used to target innocent civilians it is an act of terror.  What we don’t yet know, however, is who carried out this attack, or why; whether it was planned and executed by a terrorist organization, foreign or domestic, or was the act of a malevolent individual.  That's what we don't yet know.  And clearly, we’re at the beginning of our investigation.  It will take time to follow every lead and determine what happened.  But we will find out.  We will find whoever harmed our citizens and we will bring them to justice.We also know this -- the American people refuse to be terrorized.  Because what the world saw yesterday in the aftermath of the explosions were stories of heroism and kindness, and generosity and love:  Exhausted runners who kept running to the nearest hospital to give blood, and those who stayed to tend to the wounded, some tearing off their own clothes to make tourniquets.  The first responders who ran into the chaos to save lives.  The men and women who are still treating the wounded at some of the best hospitals in the world, and the medical students who hurried to help, saying “When we heard, we all came in.”  The priests who opened their churches and ministered to the hurt and the fearful.  And the good people of Boston who opened their homes to the victims of this attack and those shaken by it.So if you want to know who we are, what America is, how we respond to evil -- that’s it.  Selflessly.  Compassionately.  Unafraid.In the coming days, we will pursue every effort to get to the bottom of what happened.  And we will continue to remain vigilant.  I’ve directed my administration to take appropriate security measures to protect the American people.  And this is a good time for all of us to remember that we all have a part to play in alerting authorities -- if you see something suspicious, speak up.I have extraordinary confidence in the men and women of the FBI, the Boston Police Department, and the other agencies that responded so heroically and effectively in the aftermath of yesterday’s events.  I’m very grateful for the leadership of Governor Patrick and Mayor Menino.  And I know that even as we protect our people and aggressively pursue this investigation, the people of Boston will continue to respond in the same proud and heroic way that they have thus far -- and their fellow Americans will be right there with them.Thank you very much.  And you can expect further briefings from our law enforcement officials as the day goes on.  When we have more details, they will be disclosed.  What I’ve indicated to you is what we know now.  We know it was bombs that were set off.  We know that obviously they did some severe damage.  We do not know who did them.  We do not know whether this was an act of an organization or an individual or individuals.  We don’t have a sense of motive yet.  So everything else at this point is speculation.  But as we receive more information, as the FBI has more information, as our out counterterrorism teams have more information, we will make sure to keep you and the American people posted.Thank you very much, everybody.","'The American people will not be terrorized,' Obama said in a speech that evoked President George W.

A new AIDS prevention drug should be approved for use by intravenous drug users, U.S. health experts have said . A new AIDS prevention drug should be approved for use by intravenous drug users, U.S. health experts have said. The anti-retroviral drug, which has recently been approved for prescription to some other high-risk groups, could soon be given to people who inject heroin and methamphetamine. After reviewing the results of a study, carried out by Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Thai government, health officials recommended that the drug, tenofovir, should be taken daily by drug users. It has already been approved for use by high-risk gay men and heterosexual couples, CBS News reported. To conduct the study, scientists followed more than 2,400 drug users at clinics across Bangkok, in Thailand. Half were given a daily dose of tenofovir, which is sold as Viread, while the other half were given a placebo. The patients were followed for four years during which time 17 of those taking the preventative drug contracted HIV, while 33 of the people taking the placebo became infected. Therefore, it was concluded that the drug reduces HIV risk by 50 per cent. Dr Jonathan Mermin, director of AIDS prevention for the CDC, told CBS News that ‘this study completes the story’ about how HIV drugs can protect people at highest risk of infection. Currently, the only HIV prevention . drug which is available for use in the U.S. is Truvada which is . prohibitively expensive at $14,000 a year. The tenofovir which was used in the study costs just $360 a year per patient. According to researcher, Dr Michael . Martin: 'We now know that pre-exposure prophylaxis can be a potentially . vital option for HIV prevention in people at very high risk for . infection, whether through sexual transmission or injecting drug use. 'Adherence was a key factor determining efficacy in our trial among people who inject drugs.' The drug, tenofovir, which is sold as Viread, reduces a person's risk of contracting HIV (pictured) by up to 50 per cent . Scientists are also working on an HIV vaccine but the U.S. government recently stopped trials of the experimental vaccine after an independent review found it did not prevent HIV infection or reduce the amount of HIV in the blood. The research, started in 2009, it is just the latest in a series of failed attempts to develop a vaccine for the virus. In the U.S. intravenous drug users account for about one in 13 new HIV infections but in the countries of Eastern Europe and central Asia, they make up 80 per cent of those newly infected. According to the National AIDS Trust 96,000 people in the UK are currently living with HIV. Of these people, 22,600 are thought to be unaware of their infection. In 2011, only one per cent of people with HIV in the UK died. The biggest group of HIV positive people in the UK are men who have sex with men - they account for about 40,000 of the HIV infected population.","U.S. health experts say tenofovir should be approved for use by drug users .

Hospital bosses have admitted responsibility for the death of a newborn baby following an ‘appalling catalogue of failings’ by midwives. Lesley Broughton and Jason Ham's first child, Ford, died of brain damage caused by oxygen starvation at Redditch’s Alexandra Hospital shortly after his birth on October 3, 2010. Ms Broughton, 31, lost so much blood during labour that she feared for her own life. She also had to wait more . than two hours to be sent for an emergency Caesarean section after . Ford’s heartbeat dropped. Lesley Broughton and Jason Ham's first child, Ford, died of brain damage caused by oxygen starvation at Redditch's Alexandra Hospital. Midwives struggled to find the baby's heartbeat but it took two hours for Ms Broughton to be sent for an emergency C-section. The couple are pictured with a memory box they created . Investigators found that Ms Broughton was not reviewed by a consultant - despite her pregnancy being considered high risk because of complications during previous pregnancies. They also discovered that midwives failed to request additional help when the maternity unit became busy and that the couple were not provided with somewhere quiet to grieve after their baby’s death. The couple have now secured a full admission of responsibility and official apology from Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust after taking legal action. They have also received an undisclosed payout, which will be used to have treatment for depression. Ms Broughton, from Kings Norton, Birmingham, was admitted to the Alexandra Hospital on October 1, 2010, so she could be monitored closely after suffering repeated heavy bleeding. At 7.15am on October 3, midwives struggled to find a strong heartbeat for Ford, yet it took more than two hours for staff to transfer Ms Broughton to theatre for a more detailed scan and potential Caesarean section. Doctors spent 20 minutes trying to resuscitate Ford after his birth but they were unable to save him. ied, despite staff trying to resuscitate him for 20 minutes . Ford was eventually delivered at 9.39am with no signs of life. He died, despite staff trying to resuscitate him for 20 minutes. Ms Broughton, who has two children aged six and 11 from a previous relationship, said: ‘Ford was mine and Jason’s first child together and we were so excited to welcome him into the family. ‘My other children couldn’t wait to meet him and they made cards for him, so when Jason had to go back to our home and tell them they wouldn’t ever get to see him and I was poorly in hospital, it broke their hearts, too. ‘Jason and I knew something was wrong but despite begging for help, the midwives did nothing and just didn’t seem to care. I was losing so much blood I thought I was going to die. The couple say they are now too scared to try for another baby . ‘I don’t remember the Caesarean and needed further surgery. Several hours after the delivery a doctor came and told me that Ford had died while I was on my own. ‘The following day, Jason and I were allowed to go and say goodbye to Ford. We both held him in our arms and sobbed. ‘Even when I stayed in hospital to recover for three weeks, none of the nurses seemed to care about what we’d been through and didn’t offer any support or counselling.’ She added: ‘We were disgusted by the way we were treated and determined to get justice for Ford. ‘We welcome the apology but nothing could bring him back or make up for the pain we continue to suffer. We’re too scared to try for another baby because we’ve lost faith in the country’s maternity services. ‘We just hope more than anything that improvements on the ward have been made as it will give us a tiny piece of hope that Ford’s death was not completely in vain.’ Following the birth, Ms Broughton spent three weeks in hospital recovering from blood loss and further complications from surgery. She said: ‘I’m not the person I used to be. I have some good days, some bad days.’ A hospital spokeswoman said: ‘Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust apologises for the failings in care given to Ford and his family. ‘The Trust has admitted responsibility and offered a full apology to the family for Ford’s death. ‘The Trust is pleased a financial . settlement has now been reached with his family and extends its . condolences during what would continue to be a difficult time for Ford’s . family.’ Alexandra Hospital has admitted responsibility for Ford's death and has agreed an out-of-court settlement with his parents who say they need the money to pay for treatment for depression . Tom Riis-Bristow of the law firm Irwin Mitchell, which represented the couple, said: ‘This is a tragic case that has seen a young couple left devastated by the loss of their first child together. ‘What is clear is that midwives made an appalling catalogue of failings and ignored a number of clear signs that Lesley should be rushed for an emergency Caesarean to save Ford’s life. ‘It’s hard to comprehend why more was not done to investigate why Lesley was in so much pain and losing so much blood, particularly given that staff were aware she was a high risk pregnancy . ‘The couple have understandably found it incredibly hard to accept what happened and need specialist support to help them come to terms with their loss. ‘We are pleased that a settlement has been reached to fund this but we are also keen to see proof that the Trust has learnt from the mistakes it made and made improvements to ensure the same tragedy cannot happen again.’","Ford Ham died of brain damage at Alexandra Hospital, Redditch .

A massive catering operation that served up thousands of pounds of meat to feed the builders who made the famous Giza pyramids has been unearthed in Egypt, it emerged today. Archaeologists found the ancient remains at a site believed to have been a village used to house workers about 1,300ft south of the Sphinx. It is thought the workers, who occupied the site for around 35 years, were building the pyramid of pharaoh Menkaure, the third and last pyramid on the Giza plateau. The site, which has been studied for several decades, is also known by its Arabic name, Heit el-Ghurab, and is sometimes called 'the Lost City of the Pyramid Builders'. Catering operation: The site known as the Old Kingdom Corral, with the Giza pyramids in the distance. Researchers note that it was large enough to hold 55 cattle with feeding pens . The Great Sphinx and one of the pyramids at Giza, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, near Cairo, Egypt . So far, researchers have discovered a nearby cemetery with bodies of pyramid builders, a corral with possible slaughter areas on the southern edge of the workers' town and piles of animal bones. Based on animal bone findings, nutritional data, and other discoveries at this workers' town site, the archaeologists estimate that an average of more than 4,000lbs of cattle, sheep and goat meat were slaughtered every day to feed the pyramid builders. This meat-rich diet, along with the apparent availability of medical care, shown by skeletons found with healed bones, show the workers enjoyed relatively good conditions. Richard Redding, chief research officer . at Ancient Egypt Research Associates, a group that has been . excavating and studying the workers' town site for about 25 years, told LiveScience the builders were looked after. He said: 'People were taken care of, and they were well fed when they were down there working, so there would have been an attractiveness to that. 'They probably got a much better diet than they got in their village.' The site believed to have been a village used to house workers about 1,300ft south of the Sphinx . Redding estimates he has identified about 25,000 sheep and goats, 8,000 cattle and 1,000 pig bones, he wrote in a paper published in the book Proceedings of the 10th Meeting of the ICAZ Working Group - Archaeozoology of southwest Asia and adjacent Areas. Around 10,000 workers helped build the Menkaure pyramid, with a smaller work force present year-round to cut stones and complete preparation and survey work, the AERA team estimates. This smaller work force would have ramped up for a few months starting around July of each year. Redding, who is also a research scientist . at the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology and a member of the faculty at the . University of Michigan, added: 'What they would do is, for about four or five months a year, they would bring in a big work force to move blocks, and they would do nothing but move blocks.' The Great Pyramid of Giza is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and the only one to remain largely intact. It is thought to have been built as a tomb for an ancient Egyptian pharaoh over a period of around 20 years up to 2560BCE. The . pyramid was originally covered by highly polished white casing stones . that formed a smooth outer surface, but centuries of erosion mean the . structure's stepped underlying core is visible today. It is thought to be made up of around 2.3million limestone blocks believed to have been transported from nearby quarries. Originally towering at 481ft, the Great Pyramid was the world's tallest man-made structure for over 3,800 years. Today . it stands at 455ft tall, and is dwarfed by the 2,717ft Burj Khalifa in . Dubai, which currently holds the title of world's tallest building. The workers would need at least 45 to 50 grams of protein a day, Redding said. Half of this protein would likely come from fish, beans, lentils and other non-meat sources, while the other half would come from sheep, goat and cattle, he estimated. Milk and cheese were probably not consumed due to transportation problems and the cattle's low milk yield during that time, Redding said. Redding estimates that around 11 cattle and 37 sheep or goats were consumed each day in addition to supplying workers with grain, beer and other products. It is estimated that in order to maintain this level of slaughter, the ancient Egyptians would have needed a herd of 21,900 cattle and 54,750 sheep and goats just to keep up regular delivery to the Giza workers. A settlement located adjacent to the workers' town, dubbed 'eastern town,' wasn't as rigidly planned as workers' town, and its residents were eating a considerable number of pigs, the researchers found. Evidence also suggested the people in eastern town were trading with people in workers' town for hippo-tusk fragments. These findings suggest that the residents of the eastern town were not as directly involved in pyramid building and had a special relationship with the pyramid workers. 'They were not provisioned; they were not given their meat and food every day,' like those in the workers' town were, Redding said. 'It's more of a typical urban farming settlement, and there was a symbiotic relationship between the two - probably. 'What we think now is - and this is something we're going to be coming out with in the next little while - is that, more likely, it was a large portion of the work force, the more skilled laborers [living at workers' town], and that there were temporary camps up by the pyramids where the temporary workers who came in would be housed,' he said. 'They probably (didn’t) need much in the way of housing; they would need more shade than anything else. They wouldn't need any kind of warmth because it wouldn't be winter.' Future studies will look for the remains of the workers' towns of Khufu and Khafre, the two other pharaohs who built pyramids at Giza. A dump area, investigated in the 1950s, may hold them; seal impressions found at the dump have the rulers' names on them. 'What we think was going on was that Menkaure came along, he establishes his reign, he leveled that whole area and he took all the levelling debris, took it to the top of the hill and threw it over the back in a big dump,' Redding said. 'That dump on the back side of the ridge may represent a remnant of Khufu and Khafre's construction's town,' Redding said, adding that he hopes new excavations will begin on the dump in the next year or two.","Cattle, sheep and goat meat served up every day to feed builders .

Insecure: Most men admit they care more about what their male friends think of their body than their partners (stock image) Most men are more concerned about how they measure up against their male friends than what their girlfriends think of their penis size, a new study has found. While most men insisted it's not size that counts in the bedroom department, many admitted to still feeling insecure about how they compared to their male friends. Victoria University Doctorate of Clinical Psychology graduate Dr Annabel Chan Feng Yi carried out an online study of 738 men about their body image. She found most of the men, aged between 18 and 76, were insecure about their weight, build and even their penis size. But . instead of being concerned over what their girlfriend's may think of . their physique, many admitted it mattered most what their friends . thought. Dr Chan said: 'Men's pre-occupation with size was rarely to do with . pleasing sexual partners or even appearing as a better sexual partner. 'It . was often more about competition with other men. Many felt most . insecure about their size in environments where other men might see . them, such as gym change rooms.' She . said those who suffered from 'locker room syndrome' were actually . content with their size when it came to sexual matters with their . partner. But a desire . to compete against other males led to an obsession with body building . and being muscular - especially among homosexual men who were surveyed. She continued: 'The research demonstrates that societal pressures on body image are certainly not unique to women and that while men share similar body image concerns they often don't have the appropriate forum to discuss them or adequate professional support to deal with them. Confident: Most men surveyed said they were happy with the body and penis size when it came to pleasing their partner in the bedroom department (stock image) 'There is clearly a need to provide more research-based training for clinicians working in this field and public awareness to de-mystify and de-stigmatising the topic of male body image.' The research also highlighted an urgent need to incorporate the experience of men facing obesity issues and its implications in further research, instead of the current one-sided focus on men's drive for muscularity, she said. But while men don't seem to put too much emphasis on what their partners think of penis size, recent research shows it is still very important to the 21st Century woman. Women were shown several images of the male form with varying combinations of height, shoulder-to-body ratio and, of course, penis length. Women were then asked to rate the attractiveness of each man - with penis size ending up the most influential factor, according to the research published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) earlier this year. Researchers at the University of Ottawa, Canada, found that while women's opinions were influenced by a variety of physical features - tall and broad-shouldered men tended to be favoured over shorter men with bigger waistlines - the size of a man's penis reigned supreme in the attractiveness stakes. But they did also find that it was important to those surveyed for penis size to be in proportion with the rest of the body.","Victoria University carried out the online body image survey on 738 men .

Brian Harries, 42, ahad 13 heart attacks over two days and has since found out that his four sons have the same condition . A father who survived 13 heart attacks in two days has been given the devastating news that all four of his young sons have inherited the same potentially-fatal cardiac condition. Former steel worker Brian Harries, 42, was fitted with a mechanical heart and is on the transplant list for a new organ after being diagnosed with a weak heart. Experts warned there was a 50 per cent chance he had passed on his condition, so Brian and his wife Sarah, 31, took their four sons, aged eight to four, for tests. The couple were devastated to discover that all four youngsters - Luke, eight, Taylor, seven, Charlie, five, and TJ, four - have the same life-threatening condition. And the couple's two year-old daughter Brieanna could also be a sufferer, although she is too young for a conclusive diagnosis. Brian's father Gerry, 63, has also been diagnosed with the same condition - dilated cardiomyopathy - which weakens and enlarges the heart so it cannot pump blood properly. His sons now face a lifetime of medication in a bid to keep the condition at bay - and could all need a full heart transplant in the future. The father-of-five admitted yesterday that had he known he had the hereditary problem, he may have limited his family to just one child. Mr Harries said: 'If we'd known what I had was hereditary - if somebody had explained it to us - we would probably have stopped at one kid. 'When we were told that there was a 50/50 chance that the kids would have it I thought maybe one or two would - we never imagined all the boys would have it. 'Taking them up to the hospital for the tests, it was horrible. The family have since been given the devastating news that Brian's three sons, Luke, Charlie and Taylor, have the same condition. Called 'dilated cardiomyopathy', it means the heart is not strong enough to pump blood around his body . Brian and his wife Sarah have also been warned that their two year-old daughter Brieanna could also be a sufferer, although she is too young for a conclusive diagnosis . 'I took the four boys first, and you . are just hoping that they are alright, and you think that maybe one of . them has it, but when you hear four of them do - it was just gutting. I can't stop blaming myself, it is hard not to.' Mr Harries, from Clevedon, North Somerset, was first diagnosed with an enlarged heart in 2000 when he began to feel breathless at work. Thanks to medication, he led a normal life until he suffered two heart attacks in 2006 when medics then diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy. Brian was forced to give up work and was fitted with a tiny machine under his skin which delivered an electric shock to his heart if it began to beat abnormally. Following his heart attacks, Brian was fitted with a mechanical heart with a battery-powered pump which compensates for his heart's failures (pictured). He is also on the transplant list . But at a birthday party in January 2011, he began to feel unwell again and was rushed to Bristol Royal Infirmary where he had 13 heart attacks in just two days. At one point, Mrs Harries watched in horror as his heart stopped completely for 45 minutes and doctors considered stopping treatment. But the father-of-five miraculously pulled through and was fitted with a battery-powered pump which compensates for his heart's failures. It was only when his own father was diagnosed with the same condition late last year that Brian and Sarah realised their children could also be a risk. Doctors told them there was a 50 per cent chance they would also have it and tests in April confirmed their worst fears. Mrs Harries is now a full-time carer for her husband who has to wear a battery-filled backpack which powers the pump below his heart while he waits for a transplant. He added: 'Some days it's good, some days I can't get up the stairs without getting really tired' The boys are all on medication to control the condition and are so far unaffected by it, while Brieanna is currently healthy but could develop it as her heart grows. Mrs Harries is now a full-time carer for her husband who has to wear a battery-filled backpack which powers the pump below his heart while he waits for a transplant. He added: 'Some days it's good, some days I can't get up the stairs without getting really tired. 'But now I guess I have put myself on the back burner and just think about the kids. 'They're ok just now. They still go to their afterschool clubs and play football and the rest of it. 'But they could all of them need a transplant in the future, although it's too early to tell at the moment.

An NHS hospital offering acupuncture has been slammed by watchdogs for making bogus claims about how the technique can cure a remarkable range of ills . An NHS hospital offering acupuncture has been slammed by watchdogs for making bogus claims about how the technique can cure a remarkable range of ills. The Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine (RLHIM), which offers alternative treatments from hypnosis to homeopathy, has been told to stop misleading patients. The hospital, which is part of the NHS, issued two leaflets boasting about the efficacy of the ancient Chinese therapy,  which involves inserting pins into pressure points on the body. It claimed that acupuncture could treat a long list of ailments, ranging from gynaecological and urinary disorders to fertility issues, stress, depression, back pain, asthma and high blood pressure. However, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) consulted medical experts and found there was no robust evidence to back up the vast majority of the cures claimed. It has ordered the hospital to withdraw the leaflets and to stop making claims for acupuncture that cannot be substantiated by good and independent evidence. The ruling raises questions as to why millions of pounds taxpayers money is being used to fund alternative health treatments where there is little or no evidence that they work. The first leaflet issued by the hospital stated: ‘Acupuncture is a part of Traditional Chinese Medicine, a system of healing which has been practised in China and other Eastern countries for thousands of years.’ It added: ‘Although often used as a means of pain relief, it can treat people with a wide range of illnesses….Its focus is on improving the overall well-being of the patient, rather than the isolated treatment of specific symptoms.’ However, it then went on to give a long list of conditions treated by the hospital’s doctors using acupuncture. The hospital subsequently admitted to the ASA that there was insufficient evidence to back up its claims that acupuncture could treat many of the conditions identified in the leaflets. The hospital admitted to the ASA that there was insufficient evidence to back up its claims that acupuncture could treat many of the conditions identified in the leaflets . These included disturbances of the . menstrual cycle, gynaecological disorders, men’s health issues including . prostatitis, urinary disorders and fertility, emotional issues, stress, . anxiety, depression, addictions, tinnitus, dizziness, vertigo, immune . system imbalances, allergies, shingles, gastro-intestinal conditions, . upper respiratory disorders such as sinusitis and asthma, and . hypertension. The RLHIM submitted 43 papers as evidence to support its other claims, which were then checked by a medical expert in one of the most complex investigations ever run by the ASA. It found that claims made for the treatment of hot flushes in menopausal women, period pain, overactive bladder syndrome and facial pain were not substantiated or misleading. The ASA said there was some evidence that the therapy could offer temporary relief from tension headaches, but not for the hospital’s claims it could treat chronic headache and migraine. In a damning ruling, the ASA said: ‘We told RLHIM they should not state or imply that acupuncture was efficacious for conditions for which they did not hold adequate evidence.’ The ruling raises questions as to why millions of pounds taxpayers money is being used to fund alternative health treatments where there is little or no evidence that they work . The complaint against the hospital was brought by the Nightingale Collaboration, a campaigning group which was set up to challenge claims made for quack treatments. Its director, Alan Henness, said: ‘When misleading claims are made in adverts for healthcare products and services, consumers are unable to make fully informed healthcare choices.’ He said: ‘This adjudication is particularly important since the RLHIM is funded by the taxpayer and is part of University College London Hospitals. The legitimacy that being part of the NHS gives must not be abused by making misleading claims. ‘This is a win for consumer choice. We all should expect advertising to only make claims that can be backed by good evidence. ‘The same rules apply to everyone regardless of what product or service they advertise and we certainly should not be lowering standards for health claims.’","The Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine told to stop misleading patients .

Four children who were killed when fire broke out in a home day care died because their irresponsible carer twice left the children alone to go shopping, jurors heard yesterday. Investigators say 24-year-old Jessica Tata was shopping at a nearby Target in Houston, Texas, when a fire broke out in her home's kitchen. The fire is believed to have been sparked by oil in a frying pan in the care home's kitchen, which started while Tata, who was indicted on four counts of felony murder, was shopping at a Walmart and passing time in a Starbucks. Jessica Tata, accused in the deaths of four children at her west Houston daycare, pictured during the opening statements at the Harris County Criminal Courthouse . Scene of the deaths: Fire crews can be seen dealing with the aftermath of the deadly blaze, believed to have been caused by oil in a frying pan . Prosecutors played back surveillance . video that they say shows Tata shopping alone at the Walmart on the morning . of the fatal blaze in February 2011. They also allege that she also went shopping earlier that morning, leaving behind the children who ranged in age from 16 months to 3 years old. The video later shows her van leaving the store's parking lot, though it isn't clear if the children are in the vehicle. Tata's attorneys also showed a video, one she took the day of the fire that shows her loading the children into the van. However, defense attorney Mike DeGeurin did not say what time the video was taken or if it was before Tata had gone to Walmart. Died: Four children died during the Texas blaze in February - clockwise from top, Shomari Dickerson, Kendyll Stradford, Elias Castillo and Elizabeth Kajoh . Tragedy: Fireman leave the building after extinguishing the fire and bringing out the children trapped inside . In the video, Tata could be heard telling the children, 'OK guys, get up. It's time to go.' Three-year-old Shomari Dickerson, who died in the fire, could be seen running outside of the home to the van. Tata's attorneys argue that she never intended to hurt the children and that she tried to save them from the fire, which injured three other children. Tata was indicted on four counts of felony murder, three counts of abandoning a child and two counts of reckless injury to a child. But she is currently being tried in Houston on just one of the murder counts, for the death of 16-month-old Elias Castillo. If convicted, the 24-year-old Tata faces a sentence ranging up to life in prison. Brian Smith, who worked at the Walmart, testified yesterday that the surveillance video and a receipt he reviewed showed Tata was at the store around 7:50am on the day of the fire. In the video, Tata can be seen walking down an aisle alone. On trial: Former day care operator Jessica Tata, pictured during her arraignment . Prior testimony indicated that most of the children in Tata's care that day had been dropped off by 7:15am. 'Does she appear to be in a hurry?' prosecutor Steve Baldassano asked, referring to the video. 'No,' Smith responded. Smith later acknowledged that he couldn't tell if any children were in the van as it left the Walmart parking lot. Prosecutors also played surveillance video showing Tata shopping at Target just before the fire, which investigators say was sparked by oil in a frying pan on a stovetop burner. Tata can be seen arriving at the store at 1:06pm, paying for her items and then lingering in a Starbucks in the store before leaving at 1:22pm. More testimony about when Tata was in the Target is expected today, and the trial is expected to last about a month. Legal experts say that if prosecutors can prove the deaths occurred because she abandoned the children to go shopping, they don't need to prove intent to harm to secure a murder conviction. Under Texas law, a person can be convicted of felony murder if he or she committed an underlying felony and that action led to the death.","Prosecutors say Jessica Tata left four children - aged between 18 months and three years - while she went shopping .

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 06:25 EST, 19 December 2011 . A father-of-two will celebrate his first Christmas since 1994 after a brain injury wiped out 17 years of memories. Gary Rogers, 43, did not even recognise his own daughters after suffering a heart attack and being left in a coma while on holiday. The cardiac arrest left him with memory loss, caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain. Christmas to remember: Gary Rogers, right, will celebrate December 25 with his wife Linda and daughters Lilly, 15, far left, and Olivia, 18, centre right, at their home in Basildon, Essex . Now, after months of hard work trying to re-build his life, he is preparing to celebrate the first Christmas he will remember after he woke up thinking it was 1994. He will spend December 25 with his wife Linda, who is now his full-time carer, and daughters Olivia, 18, and Lilly, 15, at their home in Basildon, Essex. The brain damage which wiped out 17 years of his life happened while he was on holiday in Turkey last summer. His wife said it has been a long re-building process since he woke up in a British hospital last September. 'Although some of Gary’s memories from longer ago have returned, he struggles to remember anything about the last year, or the two years leading up to his heart attack,' said Mrs Rogers. 'But now, he is beginning to remember important things that happen - and hopefully this Christmas will really be one to remember. 'Last year, Gary was crying in the run-up to Christmas because he knew he used to love all our celebrations - but couldn’t remember much about them, and knew he would struggle to remember the day once it had passed. Big day: The family celebrated Christmas together last year in the weeks after Gary's heart attack, however he had already forgotten it by Boxing Day. Here he is sat with daughter Lilly, 15, left, his wife Linda, and elder daughter Olivia, 18 . 'We took loads of family photos to document the whole day - but by Boxing day, Gary couldn’t remember anything. 'This year, his memory is much better, and we’re really looking forward to a lovely, memorable day together.' Gary, who used to work in building maintenance, was put in a medically induced coma after falling ill on holiday. Doctors warned his devastated family he had suffered brain damage, caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain. He remained in intensive care in Turkey until he was well enough to be flown home to the Essex Cardiothoracic Centre, where doctors woke him. Linda said the family realised just how badly his brain had been damaged in the following days. 'I asked him what year it was, and he said 1994 - he was dumbfounded when I said it was 2010, she said. 'I had to stay strong for the girls and Gary, but inside I was broken. The girls were crushed, knowing that their dad didn’t have a clue who they were. But we had to stick together and keep fighting. We knew we’d pull through it as a family. Last Christmas: Gary with Olivia and Lilly in December 2010. However, he has no recollection of the day and the last Christmas he can recall was in 1994 . 'When Gary came home, Olivia had to show him round the house - it was like he was seeing everything for the first time. 'He didn’t know where things were kept, and didn’t recognise any clothes in his wardrobe. It was absolutely awful. 'After we’d shown Gary round the house, he turned to me and said ""thanks for letting me stay."" 'I was devastated. I told him it was his home, but he turned to me and said: ""You’re not my wife - we’ve split up, haven’t we? I’m married to someone else now."" 'I tried not to show Gary how upset I was. I told him we’d been married for 25 years and had never been apart. 'He said this woman was a bit like me, but different - we think he was confusing me now with how I looked when we first got married - but it was horrible to hear him say it.' She added that in the days after he woke up he had a 'blank look' on his face and had no idea he was a father-of-two. Linda said: 'I started to talk to him about our . daughters - but he just looked at me blankly. I showed him pictures of . them, hoping he would recognise them - but he just shrugged. 'I desperately tried to get him to remember - but his memories were so vague, he couldn’t remember anything about them. 'I was devastated. When the girls came to see their dad, he just stared at them blankly - he didn’t recognise them. Slowly, Gary’s long term memory has started to return - after a lot of help from his family. Linda and his daughters bought him a diary, to help him remember what he had done - and even made a tick-chart for him so he could cross off certain tasks, like brushing his teeth. Linda added: 'Gary’s memory is still hazy, and he doesn’t remember anything at all for the 18 months leading up to his heart attack. 'He has vague memories of the past, but there are still some things that he has no recollection of. 'When we were watching the Royal Wedding, he suddenly shouted: ""Princess Diana’s dead!"" 'It’s been a long journey, and there is still a long way to go, but we know Gary loves us, and we will always have each other. 'Gary could have died that day - so we consider ourselves very lucky. We’re working towards getting our normal life back. 'We just want the simple life - and a family Christmas that we can all have some treasured memories is our wish come true.' Gary added: 'I don’t remember last Christmas at all or any before without the help of Linda reminding me about them and it is all very vague. 'I am hoping to remember this Christmas and the way I look at it is that I will be with my beautiful girls and loving, caring wife, family and friends and that is what is important.'","Gary Rogers, 43, was put into a medically-induced coma after suffering cardiac arrest in Turkey .

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was ambushed by angry constituents during a visit to one storm  storm-ravaged neighborhood of the city on Saturday. 'When are we going to get some f****** help?' one woman demanded of the billionaire mayor. After six days without power, some New Yorkers are losing their patience with the response from the city. Scroll down for video . Furious: Residents of the storm-ravaged Rockaways in Queens, New York, confronted Mayor Michael Bloomberg . The mayor's surprise visit to the Rockaway, Queens, which was flooded out by the storm and then decimated by horrific fires, was greeted by angry residents who said they were only now beginning to receive aid. 'There’s old ladies in my building that don’t got nothing,' one furious man told Bloomberg. The exchange, which left the mayor at a loss for explanations, was captured by a NY 1 TV crew who happened to be in the neighborhood at the same time. 'Mr Bloomberg, this is the first drop off site,' the man said. 'Over the bridge we can't get a bottle of water, a hot chocolate, a coffee, nothing.' 'You know, we're trying to do it as fast as we can,' Bloomberg replied. Caught off guard: The mayor explained the help was on the way, though it seemed all to slow to cold and tired New Yorkers . Furious: The expletive-laden questions revealed that many New Yorkers are still suffering . Bloomberg, meanwhile, told a local TV interviewer that he had fought to keep the marathon going but the controversy had become ‘so divisive’ and too much of a distraction. ‘I still think that we had the resources to do both, and that we want people to be able to take a break and that sort of thing. ... It's a big part of our economy,’ Bloomberg told WCBS-TV on Saturday during a visit to the borough of Queens. When asked what he would say to all the runners who had flown in for the event, he said: 'I’m sorry. I fought the battle, and sometimes things don’t work out.' Source of controversy: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg cancelled the marathon Friday amid growing public pressure . Called off: A woman runs through debris from Superstorm Sandy.

Preparations: Workers yesterday continued to set up the finish line area of the New York City Marathon in Central Park, just hours before the annual event was called off . Ready for action: New York Marathon organisers were preparing for the race right up until yesterday afternoon . Should the New York marathon go ahead, despite thousands still suffering black-outs? As he spoke, he was met by catcalls from residents angry about the city's response to the storm. Friday afternoon’s last minute decision to cancel the New York marathon was taken amid growing concerns for runner safety and fears they would face abuse from angry New Yorkers. Speaking at a press conference in the wake of Friday’s decision, Mary Wittenberg, the CEO of the New York Road Runners, said she had sensed a growing ‘animosity toward the runners’ in the days leading up to the proposed event. ‘We became concerned that... no runner - the best in the world or somebody hoping to finish - was going to receive the welcome that we thought they'd receive,’ Wittenberg said. Many runners have been understanding about the decision to call off the marathon and have sought to get involved in the relief effort. Newark Mayor Cory Booker tweeted Saturday afternoon that he had received a call from 40 runners from Amsterdam who wanted to volunteer. Sunday's marathon was canceled late Friday afternoon after mounting criticism over Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s decision to go forward with the race. In the morning Bloomberg had reiterated that the race would go ahead, he called the marathon an ‘integral part of New York City's life for 40 years.’ However by late afternoon he was facing growing criticism that the timing of the race was inappropriate and resources could be better focused on helping the victims of Superstorm Sandy, the decision was taken to cancel the marathon.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg toured a storm damaged area of Tottenville in Staten Island before claiming the marathon had become a 'source of controversy and division' Race is off: The Mayor insisted the Marathon would not interfere with the recovery of the city but decided to cancel it after pressure . ‘He is clueless without a paddle to the reality of what everyone else is dealing with,’ fumed Joan Wacks, whose waterfront condo in Staten Island was under four feet of water. ‘He's supposed to be the mayor of all the city, but he's really the mayor of Manhattan.’ Melanie Bright, who went three days without electricity and hot water, said the mayor didn't get it. ‘He feels like we should carry on with our lives, even though people have lost everything,’ she said. More than 30,000 people signed an online petition saying that they didn’t want the race going ahead. Ultimately, Bloomberg canceled the event. ‘We cannot allow a controversy over an athletic event - even one as meaningful as this - to distract attention away from all the critically important work that is being done to recover from the storm.’ The decision quickly drew praise from some of the same officials who had slammed the marathon schedule hours earlier. The mayor made a ‘sensitive and prudent decision that will allow the attention of this city to remain focused on its recovery,’ said Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer. But for Eddie Kleydman, motioning toward huge piles of ruined furniture in his Staten Island street, the mayor's last-minute change of heart wasn't enough. ‘He's worried about the marathon. I'm worried about getting power,’ Kleydman said. ‘So he called it off.

Before: This is Daphne Carroll before she underwent 'laser facial' treatment at a medspa in Tennessee to have a spider vein on her cheek treated . After: Mrs Carroll endured swelling, second-degree burns and permanent nerve damage as a result of the surgery . She told ABC News that after countless visits to neurologists, dermatologists and plastic surgeons, she has come to grips with the fact that the damage is permanent. 'I describe it as - if you hit your thumb with a hammer and you feel that throbbing. It's that through my cheeks,' the 42-year-old Mrs Carroll told WZTV in Nashville. The damage has also has also impaired the La Vergne, Tennessee, woman's eyesight - making it difficult for her to drive. She called the side effects of the procedure 'the most horrible experience of my life.' Mrs Carroll said she was approached by staff at a medspa in 2007 when she went in to buy makeup. They called the procedure a 'laser facial.' Mrs Carroll said she never realized that it was actually surgery performed with a powerful laser. 'All possible side effects were downplayed, and the consent form did not say surgery,' Mrs Carroll told ABC. Disfigured: Carroll said she has had to see neurologists, dermatologists and a plastic surgeon as a result of the laser facial procedure . She later learned that the physician supervising the procedure was an OB-GYN, not a certified plastic surgeon, she alleges. Staff at the spa promised the laser treatment would eliminate the spider veins in her cheeks, stimulate collagen production to reduce wrinkles and clean out her pores. Instead, she awoke with horrific second-degree burns to her face, swelling and shooting pain. The disfiguring burns eventually healed, but the pain and numbness in her face remains.

It is known to millions of viewers as the picturesque home of curmudgeonly GP Doc Martin. But now the sleepy Cornish village of Port Isaac has been rocked by a tale of fraud, intrigue and revenge as dramatic as the most outlandish TV script. Police have been called to investigate a bitter vendetta against local hotel owner Paul Williams, which revealed his secret criminal past to unsuspecting neighbours. The 56-year-old was exposed as a convicted conman via a campaign of anonymous emails, prominent street posters, and computer discs mysteriously dropped off to homes. They revealed that in 2006 Mr Williams . was jailed for 18 months by a judge who called him ‘a charlatan, a . conman and someone who piratically preys’ on vulnerable elderly people. Ruff Justice: The criminal past of Hotelier Paul Williams, pictured with his dog Geno, was exposed via a campaign of anonymous emails and street posters plastered across the Cornish village of Port Isaac . Fiction: Martin Clunes and Caroline Catz star in the hit ITV series, which is filmed in Port Isaac . Mr Williams had posed as a clairvoyant, telling a widow he had contacted her dead husband who told him that his will – in fact a forgery – was hidden in a grandfather clock. A few months later, he defrauded a blind 82-year-old man. Mr Williams had thought he had put that reputation behind him when he moved to Port Isaac – known to Doc Martin fans as Port Wenn – and took over the Bay Hotel. The building appears in the show as Wenn . House and regularly plays host to cast and crew, including star Martin . Clunes, making Mr Williams something of a local celebrity, especially as . he also regales guests with stories of the wild times he says he spent . with 1980s band Dexy’s Midnight Runners. Star of the show: The Bay Hotel appears as Wenn House on the ITV series Doc Martin and regularly plays host to cast and crew . Exposed: Mr Williams was exposed as a convicted conman via a campaign of anonymous emails, street posters, and computer discs mysteriously dropped off to homes in Port Isaac, Cornwall . Rock and roll past: Mr Williams is something of a local celebrity having once been a drummer with 1980s band Dexy's Midnight Runners . But not everyone has been charmed. Tom Lane, proprietor of The Edge restaurant opposite the Bay Hotel, fell out with Mr Williams late last year after a business deal went sour. Mr Williams had invested £5,000 in The Edge in November 2011, but Mr Lane was disappointed with how their relationship developed. ‘He never put in the hours he promised,’ he complained. ‘He would just wander in, put his feet up with a cup of tea and chat to customers. I bought him out for £40,000 in December as I couldn’t stand it any more. ‘Nothing about him rang true. He told me and other locals that he was in Dexy’s. He said the royalties from songs like Geno were enough to live on for a year. It was all rubbish. After I saw the posters and got one of the CDs, everything became clear.’ The business spat meant the finger of suspicion pointed at Mr Lane. Police investigating the campaign against Mr Williams seized his computer, but it has now been returned, and no one has been charged. Troubled times: The next series of Doc Martin, set to air in the autumn, is likely to be the last, leading to fears that the Bay Hotel's tourist trade could dry up . On Friday, Mr Williams admitted his criminal past but said the vendetta against him was motivated by jealousy, that it included intimidation and blackmail, and even claimed his brakes had been tampered with. He said: ‘I did wrong. I’ve paid for it. I’ve got myself clean. I’ve got off the alcohol. I’ve got off the drugs – put my life right. I’ve done everything I can in this village and taken The Bay from an old dump to a very successful business.’ However, there are fears the lucrative trade from tourists and the TV production could dry up, as the next series of Doc Martin, set to air in the autumn, is likely to be the last. And Mr Williams’s life in Port Isaac is no longer rosy since the campaign. He is rarely seen outside his hotel and his 23-year-old wife Katie Williams, a flautist, and their two-year-old daughter do not appear to have lived there since last year.","Paul Williams, 56, exposed as conman after anonymous vendetta .

Killer: Alan Daulby knifed his ex-partner Avril Flanagan (right) 53 times after she ended their relationship in 2009 . A jilted stalker who stabbed his ex-girlfriend more than 50 times faced 20 years in jail today after being convicted of murder. Alan Daulby killed blonde Irish bar worker Avril Flanagan, 20, after she ended their relationship by knifing her in the head, neck, chest, arms and legs with a kitchen knife. Daulby, 26, subjected his former partner to seven minutes of agony before meticulously cleaning up the murder scene in his apartment on Spain's Costa Blanca and going on the run. He had phoned her so many times in the week leading up to the killing after the break-up that Avril had broken her phone SIM card to stop taking his calls. She had begged her former lover to . stop stalking her the week before he stabbed her to death in his . apartment in Cabo Roig on the Costa Blanca. Daulby, . from Blundellsands, Merseyside, stabbed the bar worker 53 times, . wrapping her body in plastic sheeting and hiding it under the sofa, . before burning the murder weapon and her belongings and fleeing the . scene. He was eventually arrested by armed police after a chase nearly 200km away. Today Daulby wept as the unanimous guilty verdict was read out after a three-day trial in Elche, near Alicante in Spain. As . armed police led him away, Daulby, who claimed in court that he mistook . Avril for an intruder, told the court: 'I just want to say I'm very . sorry to the family for everything's that happened.' Speaking outside court, her dad, Gerry, said: 'We'd like to thank our legal team for all the excellent job they've done. 'We just hope now he gets the full 20 years. Avril was a human being and my only daughter.' Avril went missing after going to Daulby's flat in the resort of Cabo Roig on May 29, 2009, to pick up belongings and beg him to leave her alone. The pair had shared the apartment until Avril ended their 18-month-long relationship a week earlier. Forensic experts said Avril died only after she had been stabbed 47 times. Police put the number of stab wounds at 53. Family torn apart: Avril Flanagan, centre, pictured with her brother Ger and his fiancee Emeline . He spent three hours cleaning up the flat, washing and changing and wrapping Avril in plastic sheeting to remove her body before fleeing after being disturbed by his dad and her family. He also tried to burn the murder weapon and Avril's belongings before being arrested by armed police after a chase nearly 200 kilometres away. Daulby is expected to learn his sentence within the next fortnight. Jose Carlos Munoz, a private prosecutor acting for Avril's family, revealed outside court that Daulby offered to do a deal before the trial which was rejected by her mum and dad. Under the deal he would have pleaded guilty and spared Avril's family a court trial - but in return for a lighter sentence. He said: 'I'm glad Avril's killer has been forced to see and hear over three days in court what he did to her. He'd invented his own story over the time he's been held in jail. 'Now he's seen with his own eyes the pain and suffering he's caused Avril's and his own family with his actions.'","Alan Daulby stabbed former partner 53 times after she dumped him .

He said: ‘I’m not really too sure exactly how I first sustained the back injury. It sort of reared its head in different ways, and in the most recent way it’s been affecting my knee, which has been a bit of a problem. ‘And when I start losing power in my leg, I’m not in control of the bike. ‘This last injury has been weighing me down. I’m missing my bike a lot. I’m a little bit frustrated at the moment.’ Mr MacAskill has suffered a number of setbacks since he rose to internet fame four years ago.

Proud father Anthony O'Grady never got to walk his daughter down the aisle after he drank so much at her engagement party that he died, an inquest heard. The 53-year-old warehouse manager was not a heavy drinker but on the night of his daughter Siobhan's bash he had at least six pints of Stella Artois. He managed to get a taxi home from the celebrations in the early hours of the morning, but he fell off a small wall close to his house. Tragedy: A taxi driver dropped Mr O'Grady to his house in Herbert Road, High Wycombe, but rather than going straight indoors he sat on a low wall, from which he fell and later died . His body was found in a bush in a front garden by a horrified neighbour the next evening. Home Office pathologist Dr Nicholas Hunt said Mr O'Grady died of acute alcohol intoxication. The level of alcohol in his blood was recorded at 368mg alcohol per 100ml. Dr Hunt said anything above 350mg could lead to death. He added that Mr O'Grady may have fallen into an unnatural position, causing 'postural asphyxia'. The inquest heard that Mr O'Grady had attended the party at the Glass House pub, in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, with other family members and friends. Mr O’Grady, who was married but separated from his wife Penny, arrived at 9pm on Saturday 8 October and left in the early hours of the following morning. Party: Mr O'Grady, who the coroner heard rarely drank to excess, apparently drank at least six pints of Stella during the party at the Glass House, which has since been renamed . Coroner Richard Hulett was told that Mr O'Grady managed to get a taxi to his home address in nearby Herbert Road but had sat down on a small wall after paying the driver. Mr Hulett said he appeared to have 'toppled' off the wall backwards into a bush in a communal garden, and lay there unconscious until he died. Mr O'Grady's body was found the following evening by a neighbour, who initially thought it was a sack of dumped rubbish and was horrified to discover what it was. Police launched an investigation and a post mortem was carried out by the Home Office, which is called in to investigate suspicious cases. Detective Constable Holly Cannon, who investigated the death, told the inquest in High Wycombe: 'Mr O'Grady had been at his daughter's engagement party and his family reveal that he was there by 9pm and left at 1.20am. 'From CCTV images and what family members have told us he had drunk around six pints of Stella Artois. 'It is unknown what, if anything, he had drunk before leaving for the public house. 'He walked out of the public house onto the High Street and a taxi took Mr O'Grady home to Herbert Road and dropped him off,' she said. 'He had sat on a wall and dropped over backwards. The wall was not particularly high. He fell backwards and came into contact with sharp ends of twigs. 'That's why he wasn't found for some time - it was overgrown shrubbery in the front garden,' said the detective. The inquest was told that Mr O'Grady would have a drink 'from time to time, but not to high levels except on social occasions.' Dr Hunt discovered a puncture wound to Mr O’Grady’s neck which he said was consistent with falling on to sharp twigs, but he found no further injuries which suggested he had been attacked. Mr Hulett, in recording a verdict of death by misadventure, said: 'It looks to me that on this occasion he had consumed a considerable amount of drink at the social occasion. 'He got home, almost home, by taxi and seems to have sat down on this wall. Due to the fact it was very late and he had had a lot to drink, he toppled over backwards. 'Dr Hunt, in his conclusion, refers to postural asphyxia, which means that when he fell down he was so intoxicated he became comatosed and stayed in that position and may not have breathed properly, which led to him dying there and then.' He said Mr O'Grady had been 'unlucky'. Mr O'Grady's sister, Anne-Marie, said after the inquest: 'He was a lovely man, salt of the earth. He was well liked by everybody. His family was very close to him. 'It was such a happy occasion but ended in such tragedy.'","Anthony O'Grady, 53, hailed cab home after attending bash in High Wycombe .

It's those two things that landed the singles ladies of Pregnant & Dating on reality TV to begin with. Five in all, the growing and glowing women in WE tv's latest lineup play mini-golf, lace up bowling shoes and enjoy romantic non-alcoholic outings, but the mere idea of dating while pregnant has earned them a bit of snark. 'I see @WEtv has a show called #pregnantanddating. You straight people really are something else,' tweeted gay comedian Dave Rubin. Scroll down for video . Snarky response: Reality show Pregnant & Dating, starring five mothers-to-be including Melissa Miester (right), has generated some 'grossed out' comments on Twitter . While some of the on-air dates know about the pregnancies, most of the men have at least one awkward deer-in-the-camera-lights moment when the subject comes up. And then there's the subject of sex, which the show's moms-to-be are happy to mull on air. It's also the subject that generated a gross-out factor among some on social media. But is dating while pregnant really all that wacky? In a recent Associated Press-WE tv poll, 23 percent of men said they would consider starting a relationship with a woman who is pregnant. Among online dating options are a few sites promoting pregnant sex, hookups and even one offering 'pregnant naughty chat.' Dating wasn't about sex for Melissa Meister, a model-turned-stylist in Los Angeles. Divorced, she attempted to have a baby on her own through a donor when she and her boyfriend of three years began trying together, and voila! 'About two months into my pregnancy I noticed that he posted he was in a relationship with somebody else on Facebook,' she said in a recent telephone interview. Dating, she said, was 'about getting to know people and really finding out who they are, and for the first time in my life being confident to know my boundaries and what it is that that person would need to deliver in order to be in my life.' Frank: Nail technician Megan Aballi, 28, of Orange County, Calif., is more than a little curious to know whether her late-term hormones would make sex that much better . Among her dates was an aspiring actor, Eric Joseph. The two were introduced by a mutual friend and Joseph knew she was pregnant. He was new to Hollywood at the time of filming several months ago. 'I was kind of hesitant at first, you know, considering the whole pregnant thing,' said the 30-year-old. Sex, he said, wasn't on the table. 'That really wasn't even part of the equation. If I had tried I think I would have gotten a slap in the face,' he chuckled. @FlipPrincesss: 'A reality show called ""pregnant and dating."" WTF? I mean REALLY pregnant. Can we blow up reality TV now?' ‏@RubinReport: 'I see @WEtv has a show called #pregnantanddating. You straight people really are something else.' @nprmonkeysee: 'The new WE show ""Pregnant And Dating"" is such a festival of awkward that a small, weird collection of you will like it.' @phontigallo: 'I wonder how this ""Pregnant and Dating"" show would go over if it was men with babies on the way.' @JhannaFirestone: 'The show pregnant and dating sounds like a horrible idea.' @LouieDeVito: . 'Pregnant and dating. That sounds like a good show to watch. Yeah, let . me date a broad who's knocked up by some other guy lol.' ‏@StarrMendez: 'Pregnant and dating? Wtf kinda shows are they making nowadays? Lol' ‏@DaniPreston21: 'Pregnant and dating has got to be the dumbest thing I've ever heard of... And I think I'm weird... That's way weird..' @raylena04: 'Theirs a show called pregnant and dating. Seriously tho? Like really? REALLY? I can't even watch this. [sic]' @Inzzpired: 'There's a show called #PregnantAndDating, this planet is ruined.' As for those pregnant singles in real life who seemingly enjoy that deed, Meister said: 'I support anything that empowers women and that makes them feel comfortable. But I do know that there is another side to it, the weird fetish portion of it.' Nail technician Megan Aballi, 28, of Orange County, Calif., gets a romantic kiss or two from an old flame while out and about during her pregnancy on the show. She's more than a little curious to know whether her late-term hormones would make sex that much better, but she said in an interview that she ultimately resisted. 'I definitely don't have sex on the show and that's not the point of dating,' Aballi said. 'The point was to find somebody who you can spend time with and who can be a life partner, not to have sex while dating.' The women, including swimsuit model Shana Prevette in Charlotte, N.C., and 43-year-old Rachel Klein, a TV and film producer in Hollywood who was expecting twins, bring their own baggage to the show. Klein breaks down when she visits a matchmaker and Prevette mourns the absence of her child's father during a sonogram while also dealing with her changing body. 'Bikini model or not, for some people, a baby is a deal breaker,' Prevette declares on the show as she enjoys evenings out and turns in her granny panties for some maternity lingerie. It's enough to blow the minds of some real-life men. John Burr, a 39-year-old golf equipment salesman in Palm Desert, Calif., says he finds pregnant-specific dating sites 'scary and creepy.' But he's not opposed to the idea of dating a pregnant woman. He's in a steady, six-year relationship with the mother of his 2-year-old daughter and does feel for single women trying to be pregnant all alone. 'That's something rough to deal with,' he said. 'If I was dating I wouldn't discount any person because of that factor.'",Comedian Dave Rubin tweeted: 'I see WEtv has a show called Pregnant and Dating.

It must be a cunning plan – for while actor Tony Robinson, who played Baldrick the downtrodden servant in Blackadder, is knighted in today’s Birthday Honours, there is just a CBE for his scheming master Rowan Atkinson. Robinson, whose character was famed for his shabbiness and lack of hygiene, admitted he was ‘a little gob-smacked’ at being honoured and joked that he would now be rescuing damsels in distress and slaughtering dragons if the need arose. More seriously, he added: ‘I’ll use my new title to highlight the causes I believe in, particularly the importance of culture, the arts and heritage in our society, and the plight of the infirm elderly and their carers.’ With his catchphrase ‘I have a cunning plan’, Robinson became Britain’s favourite dogsbody as the long-suffering Baldrick. And as a history-mad presenter on Time Team, he has dug up some of the country’s most prestigious archaeological sites. But his knighthood reflects neither his popularity as a sitcom star nor as a history buff. Instead, the 66-year-old actor was recommended for his ‘public and political service’ as a Labour party activist. His name was put forward by the Parliamentary and Political Services Committee, set up last year by David Cameron to reward party workers. Robinson was a member of Labour’s National Executive Committee for four years during the Blair era, and spent four years as vice-president of the Left-wing actors’ union Equity. His activism has never been low-key – wherever there’s a high-profile Leftie cause, he can often be found waving his red flag. When Bono and Bob Geldof were handing out Make Poverty History wristbands in the run-up to the G8 summit in 2005, Robinson was one of the most vociferous showbusiness supporters. His involvement with Comic Relief has seen him make several documentaries in Africa. Recognition: The Blackadder star, left, was nominated for his 'public and political services' In Britain, he rarely seems to miss a . demo. At the TUC rally against the Coalition’s spending cuts in March . 2011 he was a keynote speaker, and alongside hard-Left Labour MP Diane . Abbott he campaigns on issues such as housing and welfare benefits in . Hackney, the London borough where he grew up. Robinson . was a little-known actor before Blackadder. But his career had begun . with a West End success – he was spotted in an amateur show and offered a . part as one of Fagin’s boys in the original 1960 production of Lionel . Bart’s musical, Oliver! One night, as understudy, he stood in at short . notice for the Artful Dodger. The experience left him with a love of . comedy acting. Success: Robinson was a little-known actor before Blackadder . He spent years in repertory, then set up a community . theatre group. By the time he was cast as Baldrick in 1983, he was in his late 30s with two children. He felt distanced from the rest of the cast: Rowan Atkinson, Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, and writers Ben Elton and Richard Curtis, were all young graduates. The son of a council worker, Robinson had left school after gaining four O-levels. ‘The impression you got was that they slid off the silver spoon straight into the rehearsal room at BBC TV Centre,’ he said. Four series of Blackadder made him a household name, but it was a chance encounter with archaeology professor Mick Aston during a holiday in the Greek islands that led to Robinson’s most long-lived TV role – as the eager amateur on Time Team, leaping into Roman excavations or medieval ruins to uncover fragments of history. His enthusiasm was contagious, and the country fell in love with archaeology. Even the Royal Family were swept along. When Robinson was invited to a garden party at Buckingham Palace, the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles became engrossed in conversation about what a Time Team dig could discover at the royal sites. Robinson’s private life has been colourful. He had a short-lived first marriage, when he was 21, and since Time Team launched in 1994, he has had long-term relationships with his admin assistant Heledd Matthias, and with singer-songwriter Teri Bramah. Two years ago, he married his statuesque partner Louise Hobbs, who is 34 years his junior and, at 5ft 9in, five inches taller than him. She is also younger than both his children from his 20-year relationship with Bristol solicitor Mary Shepherd. The knighthood will further increase his profile. He once said: ‘Blackadder fans call out, “I have a cunning plan”. Time Team lovers want me to dig up their garden … while the Tories shout: “You Labour idiot!” ’ From now on, perhaps that should be ‘Sir Labour idiot’.","Singer, 25, adds another accolade to her list of achievements .

An Australian man accused of robbing a U.S. bank on New Year's Eve has told jurors in an emotional opening statement that the robbery was justified because he gave much of the money to the homeless. Corey Donaldson, an author of self-help books, is accused of robbing a Wyoming bank of $140,000 by claiming explosives were planted around the building. Donaldson, 39, is acting as his own attorney in federal court. He claims the robbery was a protest at the banks bailout during the financial crisis. 'I must say, I feel like a frightened child,' he said. 'I feel there's a lot of people who want to cut my throat.' Corey Donaldson robbed the U.S. Bank in Jackson, Wyoming on New Year's Eve. He claims he was justified in doing so because he gave the money to the homeless. Donaldson, a legal resident in the States, said he was the second of 11 children and grew up in the country outside Melbourne, only to see his father lose his home to bank foreclosure. Donaldson said he became homeless late last year, coming face-to-face with people who were on the streets because of bank foreclosures. 'I came up with the idea that since the banks had been bailed out, and the people had not, I was going to confiscate money from US Bank in Jackson and redistribute it to the poor and homeless in America,' Donaldson said. 'And that's what I did.' The U.S. District judge ruled last week that Donaldson, whose books include Don't You Dare Get Married Until You Read This, cannot argue to the jury that he was justified in robbing the bank. Jared Thomas Williams, branch manager of the bank, testified that Donaldson met him in his office on the day of the robbery. He said Donaldson told him members of a Mexican cartel were outside the building and were prepared to blow it up if Williams didn't turn over $2million in cash. He said Donaldson told him: 'There were four military-grade explosives that had been buried in the snow, and they were prepared to detonate them.' Williams said he loaded $140,000, nearly all the cash in the bank, into a duffel bag and gave it to Donaldson. Donaldson later asked Williams, 'If you knew there were foreclosed people on the streets who feel that way every day, how would you feel about it?' Prosecutor Todd Shugart objected, and Johnson ruled that Williams shouldn't answer. Donaldson is representing himself during the trial at a Cheyenne court . Investigators began looking for Donaldson after piecing together information from surveillance cameras in and around the bank. Authorities arrested him when his longtime friend Kevin Lee Day called police after Donaldson turned up at his home in late January. Day testified that he and Donaldson have been close friends for 16 years. He said Donaldson told him where to find $8,000 after the robbery. Day said he became emotional when he received the money, and that it came at a good time because he faced losing his Utah house to foreclosure. Investigators testified Tuesday that they recovered about $30,000 after Donaldson's arrest. Donaldson told an FBI agent shortly after his arrest that he had intended to surrender. The case continues.","Corey Donaldson carried out the robbery in Wyoming on New Year's Eve .

Warning: Stephen Hester, the RBS chief executive, warned today that it could take 10 years for the government to dispose of its 81 per cent stake in the bank . The sale of state-owned Royal Bank of Scotland so taxpayers can be repaid their £45billion stake could drag on for a decade, according to its outgoing chief executive. Stephen Hester said that privatising the bank was a long-term project that could take until 2023. Mr Hester was pushed out last week in a move approved by Chancellor George Osborne, although he will pick up a golden goodbye worth up to £5.6million. He was brought in to run the bank after the Treasury was forced to bail out RBS during the financial crisis five years ago by buying an 81 per cent stake. But Mr Osborne believes he is not the right person to guide the bank through privatisation. Mr Hester said: ‘It is clearly up to the Government how it privatises, when it privatises and what the important features are. ‘My observation is that if the desired proceeds are £45billion, then there has never been a privatisation that raises that much in one go. It is likely that it would be, if you do it conventionally, four or five goes over ten years. ‘That’s why I’ve always been confident that the state would get its £45billion back.’ He said he would support a wholesale giveaway of shares to the public, in the style of the privatisation of British Gas in the Eighties, which was marketed with the ‘Tell Sid’ ad campaign. Mr Hester said that while such a giveaway was ‘perfectly legitimate’, Mr Osborne had to consider the politics of the sale as well as the economics. He claimed he did not feel any anger over the manner of his departure, adding: ‘I don’t want to show frustration, I don’t want to punch someone in the eye. Sell-off: The government is hoping to recoup the full £45billion it spent bailing out the Royal Bank of Scotland at the height of the financial crisis . ‘I haven’t hidden from anyone that I am torn a bit at this juncture. ‘Part of me did want to see the job . fully through, did want the champagne and roses of a successful . privatisation. Another part of me thought, “Goodness me, this job drives . me nuts from time to time and how long do I want to do it for?”. ‘I genuinely mean I am comfortable . with what has happened. RBS is in much better shape than we had any . right to think it could be. I want the company to have a good future and . I want to pass the baton on smoothly and without rancour or difficulty. I am happy with this result.’ The Treasury is said to agree that . the sell-off will take a while. Sources said last week it would take . ‘many years’ to complete what would be the biggest privatisation in . history. Replacing Mr Hester is expected to . take at least six months, with Mr Osborne reportedly sharing the RBS . board’s view that the next chief executive must be prepared to stay on . for at least five years. A £1 billion rescue plan for the Co-operative's troubled banking arm is set to be unveiled this week in a move likely to hit up to 5,000 small investors. The mutual has been racing to plug a shortfall of up to £1.5 billion in its finances identified by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), the new City watchdog. It is likely to do so through the disposal of its insurance business and a portfolio of loans, although the Sunday Times said a large part of the cash is expected to come from bondholders. This would impact more than 5,000 investors who lent money to the Co-op through securities called permanent interest bearing shares that pay dividends of up to 13 per cent a year. As much as 30 per cent of their cash could be wiped out or transferred into a new vehicle, it was reported. No taxpayers' money will be involved and the Co-op will be spared from having to sell other assets in the wider group, such as its pharmacy chain. The black hole in the Co-op's capital reserves largely stems from commercial property loans acquired through a merger with the Britannia building society in 2009 that created a financial 'super-mutual'.","Outgoing boss says government's 81% stake will have to be sold off in four or five tranches over a decade .

"By . David Wilkes . UPDATED: . 06:54 EST, 23 September 2011 . The intrepid adventurers: Mr Scott and Miss Norris have been travelling around Latin America for five-and-a-half years . Their motorhome had plunged into a ravine in the Amazon jungle, hundreds of miles from civilisation, and they had not seen another motorist for 48 hours. But intrepid Lesley Norris and Bruce Scott did not panic. Instead, they instigated an extraordinary trans-Atlantic rescue mission by ringing Miss Norris’s brother-in-law 5,125 miles away in Eastbourne, East Sussex, on their satellite phone. He took down their GPS co-ordinates so they could be traced, then alerted Dover Coastguard who in turn contacted their colleagues in Falmouth, the co-ordinating station for international alerts, who duly raised the alarm with rescue services in Brazil. A helicopter was scrambled to pick up the pair, who have been travelling in Central and South America for five and a half years in their Mercedes Unimog – an off-road adventure vehicle adapted to include a double bed and porcelain flushing loo. Badly shaken, the couple had to spend a night under the stars in the sweltering rainforest, which is home to vampire bats, poison dart frogs and black caiman crocodiles, before the helicopter arrived. Neither of the pair, who are both originally from London and gave up their jobs for a life on the open road in 2006, was injured during the drama. No more: Miss Norris said she was 'amazed' the couple managed to jump out of the vehicle unharmed . Miss Norris, 64, used to live in the . suburb of Teddington and was a British Airways stewardess for 20 years. Mr Scott, 62, who sold his studio flat in West Kensington to invest in . the Unimog, was a professional photographer who has also trained as a . bus driver. On a website about their trip, on . which Mr Scott is pictured looking debonair in a pith helmet and white . tuxedo with his arm around a uniformed Miss Norris, they described how . they have visited Mexico and were attempting to drive the length of . South America. On her last blog entry before the . accident, Miss Norris said life was getting tough in Brazil, with . ‘unseasonably hot’ temperatures of up to 40c making it unpleasant to . sleep in the truck. Unique: The couple's Unimog was an off-road adventure vehicle adapted to include a double bed and porcelain flushing loo . ‘And then Bruce got a cold,’ she . added, so they went to visit a ‘butterfly lovers’ paradise’ called . Pousada Ecologica Rio Grande Rancho to relax. But their journey came to a grinding . halt on Tuesday when a bridge collapsed and the motorhome hurtled 30ft . down the gully before turning on its side in a remote spot 200 miles . south west of the nearest city, Manaus. Last night Miss Norris’s sister, . Jenny, 62, whose husband Ken answered their call, said the couple . managed to haul themselves out of the vehicle and ‘feel lucky to be . alive’. ‘Bruce helped Lesley to climb out and . then went back down and got a couple of chairs for them both so they . could sit on the roadside,’ she said. ‘He went back down and got some tarpaulin and they slept on the road, hoping to be rescued.’ She added: ‘When Ken got the call he just rang the Coastguard straight away. ‘The first thing I heard about it was . when I got home two hours later as he did not want to worry me. I am so . glad he picked up the phone because I would not have known what to do.’ Miss Norris and Mr Bruce were picked . up by a Brazilian army helicopter yesterday and flown to Manaus, a . popular tourist destination because of its proximity to the jungle.

UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesman Fred Caygill said: ‘It’s not the first time we’ve assisted people across the world. ‘This is a bit unusual for us as it’s . not of a maritime nature, but there are no boundaries in search and . rescue.’ The Foreign Office was informed of the couple’s plight and . offered consular assistance, while the Brazilian army last night said it . will recover the couple’s vehicle.

"By . Suzannah Hills . UPDATED: . 08:07 EST, 20 May 2012 . Scotland’s Justice Secretary told the Lockerbie bomber to drop his appeal to smooth the way for him to be released on compassionate grounds, it was claimed today. Kenny MacAskill allegedly told Abdelbaset Al-Megrahi indirectly that he would be let out of jail in 2009 if he dropped his court case after he was given just three months to live. Shortly before the official announcement Al-Megrahi did mysteriously abandon the appeal against his conviction - even though he was under no legal obligation to do so. The bomber, who has terminal prostate cancer, is still alive in Libya two-and-a-half years after his release, to the embarrassment of the Scottish Government. The Scottish Government has denied claims that Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill, pictured left, suggested that Abdelbaset Al-Megrahi, pictured at a Tripoli hospital in December 2009, drop his appeal against his conviction to smooth the way for being released on compassionate grounds because of his prostate cancer . Copies of Megrahi: You Are My Jury, which contains exclusive interviews with the convicted Lockerbie bomber, at the book launch in Edinburgh today . The allegations - strongly denied by the Scottish government - appeared in a new book published today about the release entitled Megrahi: You Are My Jury. It claims Abdelbaset Al-Megrahi was the 'innocent victim of dirty politics, a flawed investigation and judicial folly'. Al-Megrahi is the only person to ever be convicted of the bombing of a Pam Am flight on December 21, 1988, which killed 270 people when it crashed in Lockerbie, Scotland. He repeatedly proclaimed his innocence and launched several appeals against his conviction. However, he abandoned the case just days before Mr MacAskill announced he would be released from jail. Abdelbaset al Megrahi on his sick bed at his home in Tripoli, Libya, speaking exclusively about his compassionate release and the Lockerbie case . An undated court photo of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi, before he was diagnosed with prostate cancer . The new book claims that Mr MacAskill met a delegation of Libyan officials ten days before announcing his decision to release Megrahi, including foreign minister Abdulati Al-Obedi. Al-Megrahi, now 59, claims in the new title: 'After the meeting, the Libyan delegation came to the prison to visit me. 'Obedi said that, towards the end of the meeting, MacAskill had asked to speak to him in private. 'Once the others had withdrawn, he stated that MacAskill gave him to understand that it would be easier to grant compassionate release if I dropped my appeal. 'He said he was not demanding that I do so, but the message seemed to me clear. 'I was legally entitled to continue the appeal, but I could not risk doing so. It meant abandoning my quest for justice.' A Scottish Government spokesman branded the book, published today, as 'third-hand hearsay'. He stated: 'We can say categorically that neither the Scottish Government had any involvement of any kind in Mr Al-Megrahi dropping his appeal, or indeed any interest in it. 'That was entirely a matter for Mr Al-Megrahi and his legal team.' The book’s author John Ashton, who spent three years as a researcher with Megrahi’s legal team, also recounts a report in The Herald newspaper four days before the meeting citing 'a growing expectation he would be encouraged to first drop legal proceedings'. Mr Ashton stated: 'The source of this information was not stated, but it seems likely that it was someone within the justice department.' A hero's welcome: Libyan Abdel Baset al-Megrahi, top left, is greeted by cheering crowds upon his arrival at airport in Tripoli, Libya, on August 20, 2009 . Libyans greeting freed Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali Mohmet al-Megrahi as he descends the steps of the plane . Scottish Labour's justice spokesman Lewis Macdonald said: 'Kenny MacAskill has repeatedly claimed that the decision for Al-Megrahi to drop his appeal was ""a matter for him and the courts"", yet these extraordinary reports throw all that into question.' The MSP added: 'These are very serious allegations. If these reports are true, then Kenny MacAskill will have knowingly misled Parliament. It is only proper that he comes before Parliament as a matter of urgency to spell out exactly what happened at Greenock Prison and in the alleged private meetings with Col Gaddafi's ministers. 'The families of the victims deserve to know whether this secret meeting took place, and if so, exactly what was discussed.' Scottish rescue workers and crash investigators search the area around the cockpit of Pan Am flight 103 in a farmer's field east of Lockerbie, Scotland, on December 23, 1988 . Bringing out the dead: One of the 270 victims is carried away from the wreckage of the bombing of Flight 103 that exploded over Lockerbie on December 21, 1988 . Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said: 'It is important that the Justice Secretary answers serious questions.' Today a spokesman for David Cameron said that the Lockerbie bomber should never have been released. He said: 'This is yet another reminder that Alex Salmond’s government’s decision to free the UK’s greatest mass murderer was wrong. 'Writing a book three years after he was released is an insult to the families of the 270 people who were murdered.' But speaking at the launch of the book in Edinburgh this morning, Mr Ashton described these comments as 'outrageous'. He said: 'The Prime Minister knows nothing about this case. He should read the book, and if he read the book he would know that this conviction was not safe. 'I think it is pretty outrageous that he would comment on something that he knows nothing about.' Debris lies in a deep gash through the town of Lockerbie, Scotland, caused by the crash of PanAm flight 103 . Book launch: Megrahi ?

Cover girl: The star of this week's net-a-porter digital edition is model and music star Karen Elson . Karen Elson and Tabitha Simmons met in Tokyo when Elson was just 16 and have remained friends ever since. 'We didn’t see each other for a year after Tokyo. Then I moved to New York and we bumped into each other at a restaurant. You would come over to my house and we would stay up late. 'Your shoe obsession was growing. You had those amazing Christian Dior boots. This was my fashion college, you know? Travelling the world, having you as a friend, we would go to the deli, and you would be decked out in Chanel!' Simmons recalls. Elson adds: 'I didn’t have anything else to wear! I had done the Chanel campaign, and Karl [Lagerfeld] took me to the shop to get a ton of clothes. Vintage: The model, who was one of eight to walk in the Olympic closing ceremony, smoulders in the vintage themed shoot . 'Those were the only nice clothes I had because I couldn’t afford anything.' Born in the north of England, Elson has lived in Nashville since 2006. Speaking about her childhood, she said: 'I left home at 16 and travelled and lived in so many different places, so when I had my daughter, Scarlett, at 26, and put my feet down in Nashville, it was a shock.' Describing her life in Nashville, she said: 'They don’t sugar-coat it, and that’s what I like about it. 'If I went home and put on airs and graces, they would bat me down in a heartbeat. It is the same in Nashville. So I can be me here and not ""Karen The Model.""

'When I go to New York or Europe, I am working and I can enjoy it. But it’s not my 24/7 life.' Discovered at the tender age of 16 by the owner of Boss models in Manchester, Elson's big break came when legendary Steven Meisel shot her for the cover of Italian Vogue on her 18th birthday. She went on to work with most of the world's major fashion photographers and fashion designers, such as Bruce Weber, Mario Testino, Mert and Marcus, and Patrick Demarchelier. Her roll call of campaigns includes Yves Saint Laurent, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Louis Vuitton, Versace, Christian Dior, Burberry and Chanel, as well as starring on the cover of  Vogue, W, Dazed & Confused and Harper's Bazaar.

When asked what the fashion world means to her now, she replied: 'It means so much to me, honestly. 'Being in fashion, knowing so many fascinating people has been such a big part of my life. From the outside, people tend to view fashion as a terrible thing, but it isn’t. 'Fashion has changed my life for the better. I love it. I’m interested in the whole process.' Reflecting on her favourite fashion memory, she said: 'Shooting with Steven Meisel for the cover of Italian Vogue in 1997, it was on my 18th birthday, and they dyed my hair – it was the best birthday present ever!'. Elson met Jack White when she appeared in The White Stripes music video for Blue Orchid, they married in 2005 and have a daughter and son together. Sadly, the pair announced their divorce in June 2011.

Fifty years is a long time in rock'n'roll, and it's said any old rocker who can remember back that far either wasn't really there or didn't know how to have fun. But Tony Hicks insists he has a clear memory of everything that happened and didn't miss out on anything. As guitarist and vocalist with the Hollies, he was there at the start of the group's enduring success story, and in this, their golden anniversary year, is still belting out their classic hits to sell-out crowds. His personal high was their success with perhaps their most iconic song, He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother. 'I'd found it browsing through a music publisher's files and thought it would make a good change of pace for us. We went into the studio with it and booked a session musician to play keyboard. The Hollies in 1964: (from left) Allan Clarke, Graham Nash, Bobby Elliott, Tony Hicks and Eric Haydock . 'He was a shy, skinny young man called Reg Dwight, later to become Elton John. We paid him £15, the going rate for the job at the time.' Young Reg helped out on some of the Hollies' album tracks too after the departure of guitarist Graham Nash, who had played keyboards when needed. 'We knew Reg because he was a staff writer with a music publisher we used. He was writing songs well before he became famous.' One was Your Song. Says Tony, 'I thought it would be a good one for the Hollies, and asked the publisher for permission to record it. He told me Elton had recorded it himself and it was due to be released in the US. He said, “But it probably won't happen for him, so wait until it's all over.”' At that time Elton had had no luck breaking into the charts, with six flops. 'Well, it did happen - Your Song became Elton's first big hit, and one that's unfailingly identified with him. But it so easily could have been Our Song.' As well as He Ain't Heavy, the Hollies' other songs, including first big hit Searchin', Just One Look, I'm Alive, Look Through Any Window, Bus Stop and Carrie Anne, have all stood the test of time. Almost 50 years later: Tony (second right) with the Hollies last year . Tony, now 67, says modestly, 'To leave out even one of those songs when we do a show would be just plain rude. And we always get a standing ovation. Does that sound flash? Well, maybe, but it's true.' The Hollies were never short of self-esteem. 'The biggest names in pop were The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. Then there was us. We toured with the Stones, as second on the bill. 'It was expected of us, as runners-up so to speak, to close the first half of the show. But we refused, insisting we went on just before the Stones, as if to challenge them to “follow that”.' Did the notoriously status-conscious Mick Jagger object? 'No, we were all good friends and the Stones never lived up to their reputation as hard men. 'Our manager was a tailor by trade, and he'd turn up backstage, hoping to sell some clothes on the side. His best customer was Keith Richards, who'd buy almost everything he was shown. There was no real rivalry. But we knew our place. And that was immediately before they went on.' They were innocent times compared to the rock excesses of later years. Drink and drugs were for the really louche. 'We'd spend our days in coffee bars, which were great meeting places. There were very few clubs to go to at night, and they were places to hear new groups rather than get off your head. We'd go to parties, but they didn't really do anything for us. 'There was very little outrageous behaviour, although I can remember us checking out of hotels in the morning and seeing the lounge piano balanced on the end of the diving board over the pool. Did we do that? Who knows… But we never got into the really wild stuff like throwing TVs out of the window.' Tony and drummer Bobby Elliott are the only remaining original members of the group's classic line-up, and even they had replaced previous members as the group began to take off. Bass guitarist Eric Haydock left in 1966, followed two years later by Graham Nash, to become part of the supergroup Crosby, Stills & Nash, while singer Allan Clarke has retired. There have been many stand-out moments in the last 50 years, says Tony, not least an Ivor Novello Award in 1993 for their outstanding contribution to British music, and their induction into the American Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame in 2010. For a group as clean-cut as the Hollies, some of the rock wildness that was played out before them was an eye-opener.

One night backstage I found a cop holding a gun to Richard's head, telling him to calm down. Big trouble all round, but I never found out what that was all about. 'Richard had a fantastic backing guitarist who was obviously destined for greater things. His name? Jimi Hendrix. He got a reputation for smashing his guitar on stage and setting fire to everything. I can't see health and safety allowing that now. 'We did try pyrotechnics ourselves, but learned our lesson when we had all these fireworks set up during one show, and they nearly took Graham's head off. We never used them again. In his early days Tony had been an apprentice electrician, playing guitar with local group Ricky Shaw and the Dolphins at weekends. He says, 'There was a group called the Hollies playing around Manchester and they wanted to turn pro, but their guitarist, Vic Steele, didn't.' Tony did, on the other hand. Mild-mannered fun: The Hollies celebrating: (from left) Bernie Calvert, Tony Hicks, Bobby Elliot and Terry Sylvester . 'So I was asked if I'd consider replacing him. I got the bus to go to listen to them but couldn't find where they were supposed to be playing. I popped into a club to ask for directions, and the place was packed out. The manageress said, “Oh, everyone's here to see that new group, The Beatles.” Anyway, she told me where I could find the Hollies, and I went there. For some reason I didn't want to go in, though, so I stood outside, listening to them through an air vent. I liked what I heard, they liked me, and it went from there.' Hicks and his wife Jane have been married for 39 years and live in Henley in Oxfordshire. Their son Paul, 34, is a Grammy-winning recording engineer who also writes film music and plays in a band with George Harrison's son Dhani. Tony says, 'So it's a family business now. When we had our first hit, we wondered if we could possibly stretch it out for  two years. Half a century has flown  by and there's still no end in sight.' How did the Hollies manage to avoid the rock'n'roll excesses? 'It's the way we were brought up. We never looked for that sort of life. We just relied on our songs. And we must have done something right because we're still here today.' Signature style: The Hollies' autographs from 1954: Graham Nash, Alan Clarke, Eric Haydock, Tony Hicks and Bobby Eliott .

He may be the most important man in your life, but British fathers are actually being shortchanged when it comes to gifts this year. According to the latest survey, children are spending on average £4 less on Father’s Day gifts than they were last year. In 2012, the average spend for gifts was £16 and this has now dropped to a measly £12. Thrifty: In 2012, the average spend on Father's Day was £16, which has dropped to a measly £12 . However, whilst dads are still getting a rough deal, high-street giant Debenhams has seen a 7 per cent increase in people buying Father’s Day gifts compared to last year but they are just being more thrifty. And dads won't be happy to hear that mothers are still coming out on top; with the average spend for a Mother’s Day gift this year coming in at a generous £21. It seems sons are the biggest culprit for not showing appreciation for their dads, the survey revealed that men were much more likely to buy a Mother’s Day present than they were to buy a Father’s Day present, with 27 per cent saying they bought a father’s day present versus 53 per cent for a Mother’s Day gift.

The restaurant chain found that dads in South West England are the most eager for quality time with the family – a whopping 95 per cent of dads chose a family meal out over a gift .

"By . Jenny Hudson . PUBLISHED: . 18:26 EST, 10 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:53 EST, 10 June 2013 . We were walking home together when my ten-year-old daughter told me she had eaten a cake at school that day. This perhaps unremarkable statement left me overjoyed because, throughout her life, Molly has lived with a potentially life-threatening milk allergy. Holy cow: A cow's milk allergy is extremely common, affecting up to 8% of children, including ten-year-old Molly . Molly's allergy was so severe that she could not manage anything containing even the tiniest amount of milk, such as a regular sandwich with butter or an ordinary biscuit. For years we had been among hundreds of thousands of British families meticulously planning allergen-free lives. In our case this meant dairy-free meals and hunting for alternatives to milk-based treats. At birthday parties, Molly couldn't touch any of the cake, but would have to take her own box of dairy-free food. We'd pack soya milk cartons for holidays abroad. Restaurants were the hardest, when she would scour the dessert menu hoping for something she could eat. I'd normally have to shake my head and promise her an alternative at home. Molly was always incredibly accepting and mature about it. A cow's milk allergy is extremely common, affecting up to 8 per cent of children and usually developing in the first year of life. This means it can be difficult to diagnose because many of the symptoms, such as reflux and diarrhoea, are common during infancy, explains Dr David Luyt, a consultant paediatrician at Leicester Royal Infirmary. 'On average, it takes three months and six visits to the GP before a milk allergy is diagnosed,' he says. Diagnosis is based on a skin prick test - a small amount of the suspected allergen is inserted under the skin with a tiny needle and raised, red skin is a sign of allergy. Milking it: By having small doses of foods made with milk, Molly was eventually able to overcome her allergy . There is also a blood test to check levels of the antibodies which trigger an allergic reaction and a 'food challenge' - when food containing the suspected allergen is given in the controlled environment of the hospital. But for us, the diagnosis was unequivocal and unforgettable. Molly was breastfed, so her first taste of dairy was from formula milk mixed with baby rice when she was six months old. She had three spoonfuls and screamed. Her face quickly began to swell. By the time I had dialled 999, Molly's left eye had disappeared under the swelling. An ambulance took us to A&E at Birmingham Children's Hospital where she was given a dose of adrenaline - this reduces inflammation and swelling in the throat, opening the airways and easing the itching. A blood test confirmed she had a severe allergy. An allergic reaction happens when antibodies become over-sensitive and attack the proteins in certain foods. These antibodies then bind themselves to the allergen and cause the release of chemicals, including histamine, which triggers swelling, itching, rashes and tightening of the airways. In extreme cases, it can cause anaphylactic shock, with severe swelling, breathing difficulties and sometimes loss of consciousness. 'A food allergy, particularly to milk, which is in so many foods, has a massive impact upon a child and their family,' says Dr Scott Hackett, consultant paediatrician in allergy at Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham. One study of 40 children, half with a food allergy and half with diabetes, found those with food allergies reported more fear about their health and eating, and more restrictions on their life overall. When it came to Molly's brother Samuel, now seven, we avoided giving him any dairy products for his first year. We were overjoyed when, aged one, he had a blood test which showed his risk of milk allergy was very low. He has eaten freely since. With the help of my husband, Dave, 46, a communications manager, I found we could make dairy-free cake and obtain dairy-free ice cream for Molly. Her annual hospital tests showed little change in the allergy. The tests checked her levels of IgE antibodies which trigger an allergic reaction. A normal reading is 0 to 6 - at the age of six, Molly's result was 78, slightly higher than when she was younger. 'She had three spoonfuls and screamed. Her face quickly began to swell. By the time I had dialled 999, Molly's . left eye had disappeared under the swelling.' Most children do grow out of their milk allergies - with about 80 per cent becoming fully tolerant by school age. It's thought this is due to a natural reduction in the IgE antibodies, and a rise in IgG4, which blocks the antibodies from binding to the allergen. 'We used to say 90 per cent will grow out of a milk allergy by school age, but we're now seeing a growing number of children whose allergy persists longer, sometimes beyond age ten,' says Dr Hackett. This seems particularly the case for children with more severe milk allergies. Even eight months ago, Molly became itchy after mistakenly having a few spoonfuls of porridge made with cow's milk. But a new scheme could offer these children an alternative to a life spent anxiously avoiding dairy. Dr Luyt has established the UK's first cow's milk tolerance system, which manipulates the immune system to actually cure the allergy. It's an approach more widely used in Europe and the U.S. and based on immunotherapy, a long-established treatment for hay fever sufferers. 'The principle is if you give someone very small doses of the allergen, very slowly building it up over time, their sensitivity to it will decrease,' says Dr Luyt. The programme is for children with a milk allergy which has persisted to the age of six. They start by having a drink which is 1 per cent milk to 99 per cent water. The dose is incrementally increased over 67 consecutive days up to full cow's milk. So far 50 patients have completed the course, with 23 completely overcoming their allergy and nine developing partial tolerance - for example, they could eat cake made with butter, because the milk proteins have been partially broken down during baking. 'We've worked with children who had really severe milk allergies who went on to develop full tolerance,' says Dr Luyt. Beating the allergy: Molly's experience and Dr Luyt's scheme demonstrate it is possible to cure the allergy . 'It can be challenging for them - children usually have tingling lips and sometimes suffer nausea and vomiting. 'But this has enormous implications because it means we can offer families more than avoiding the allergy or hoping their child will outgrow it.' The one-third for whom it does not work are not necessarily the ones with the strongest allergies. Some struggle with the side-effects of the programme, such as nausea and mild sickness, and do not complete it. A  similar programme exists for nut allergy sufferers at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, and UK experts are likely to follow colleagues in mainland Europe and Japan in setting up a tolerance programme for egg allergies. But in her own way, Molly had already stumbled across the approach by herself. Last year during breakfast, she mistakenly had a piece of toast with butter. She kept quiet, but came into the kitchen ten minutes later, asking whether the toast had butter on and grinning broadly as we realised it had. 'Nothing happened, Mum,' she said. We were both excited about what this could mean. She later tried cheese-flavoured crisps, and then a teaspoon of dairy ice cream. The second caused her lips to tingle, but she said it was 'OK because it will go away soon'. She had recognised the familiar symptoms of an allergic reaction, but also had the confidence to sense they were mild and temporary. If anything, I had a greater fear of Molly eating foods containing milk than she did. And Molly became increasingly determined  to overcome her restrictive diet. Once she had eaten dairy ice cream several times, the lip tingling disappeared. Soon, there was nothing on the 'forbidden' list. By the time Molly tried a cake at school, she'd eaten enough similar food at home to give her the confidence to go ahead. The time from Molly's first taste of butter through to full tolerance was less than three months. We had not heard of Dr Luyt's programme, but its principles reflected much of what I'd witnessed with Molly - motivation is important, as is confidence that symptoms can be handled and that the allergy can be overcome. But Dr Hackett warns people with allergies to avoid trying known allergens at home without supervision. 'There can be severe and even life-threatening reactions and we see this particularly with teenagers, who are fed up with a restrictive diet,' he says. Watching Molly tuck into her first ever ice cream on the beach on holiday recently, it seemed as if a miracle had occurred. Moving to an unrestricted diet is surely something which, if possible, should happen for children sooner rather than later.","A cow's milk allergy affects up to 8% of children, including Molly .

Angel of Woolwich: Gemini Donnelly who rushed to the scene along with her mother as Lee Rigby lay dying . A brave mother dubbed the Angel of Woolwich because she risked her own life by comforting Drummer Lee Rigby as he lay dying said she did it because of a 'mother's instinct'. Amanda Donnelly, 44, and her daughter Gemini, 20, comforted the young soldier after he was targeted near Woolwich Barracks. The pair protected the 25-year-old father-of-one from further attacks and gently stroked his body. The mother and daughter, who were driving past on their way to Tesco when they stumbled across the bloodbath, said they acted instinctively. Their brave actions won praise from Downing Street, but despite calls for the mother and daughter to be given medals Amanda said they don't deserve them. The mother-of-three said she stopped her car as she drove past the scene where Lee Rigby had been attacked and instinctively rushed to be at his side. 'I sat on the floor next to Lee's chest. I wasn't really aware of the danger, his body was still warm,' she told the Sunday People. 'I started thinking about his mum. I . thought ""This poor boy, his mother doesn't need to see this"". So I just . stayed there to protect him and rubbed his back. It was a mother's . instinct really.' As Amanda got out of the car, Gemini, who is currently looking for work, also rushed over despite fearing she could be attacked. The . pair realised instantly that Rigby, who has a two-year-old son, could . not be saved. They said the kerb was covered in blood following the . attack. Drummer Rigby was walking back to his barracks in a Help For Heroes top when he was suddenly targeted. The young soldier from the Second Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers had served in Afghanistan as a machine gunner. Amanda . added: 'I knew there was nothing I could do for the poor guy - but . kneeling over him and stroking him seemed like the right thing to do at . the time. I wish there was more I could have done.' Another woman, Ingrid Loyau-Kennett, 48, also won praise for bravely stepping forward while other passers by simply watched on. Amanda said it was only afterwards that they realised the enormity of the situation when they saw news reports on television.

The father-of-one has a two-year-old son, called Jack, and she said she would give any medal she received to him. She told the Sunday People: 'He is going to grow up without a dad now, which is so sad, so it may give him something to hold on to. 'But we don't really want medals. We don't feel we deserve them.'

"By . Paul Bracchi, Neil Sears  and Emily Andrews . UPDATED: . 08:19 EST, 18 January 2012 . An Eton-educated aristocrat who admitted having sex with a schoolgirl within days of her 16th birthday walked smiling from court yesterday after he was cleared of rape. The Honourable James Murray, 42, second son of the Earl of Mansfield, thanked his family for their ‘unstinting support’ as the tawdry details of his relationship with the troubled foster child were detailed in court. The girl had claimed that, during one of her many visits to Murray’s flat, he must have spiked her Ribena. She woke to find her tracksuit trousers tugged down to her knees and him naked beside her. Relief: James Murray, 42, leaves Oxford Crown Court after being cleared of raping a 16-year-old girl . But Murray maintained that she had agreed to sex up to six times and only later ‘cried rape’ after he told her a condom had split and she should take the morning-after pill. Far from him grooming her for sex, he insisted, she had groomed him. After a week-long trial at Oxford Crown Court, the jury took only 57 minutes to find him not guilty. His brother Alexander, Viscount Stormont and sister Lady Georgina Bullough, who supported him during the trial, exchanged relieved smiles. Outside court Murray thanked the jury, his legal team and his family. ‘This has been the most difficult 18 months for me, but more particularly for my family who had to endure the brunt of the uncertainty, detail of the allegation and the obvious interest in the case,’ he said. The court heard that Murray had met . the youngster, who would habitually play truant and had run away from . home, when she was 15. At the time, despite his family’s great wealth – . his father is worth £60million – he was leading a solitary existence . working as a self-employed IT consultant from his home in a ground-floor . flat in a down-at-heel Oxford suburb. His family maintained in court that despite his age, Murray was ‘naïve’ and emotionally immature. Support: Mr Murray leaves the court building with his sister Lady Georgina Dorothea Mary Murray, who had given evidence at his trial . Viscount Stormont, 55, said: ‘The family were always confident that Jamie was not guilty of this alleged offence.’ Despite the not guilty verdict, however, grave damage has been done to one of Britain’s most distinguished families.Murray grew up in historic Scone Palace, within a 27,000-acre Perthshire estate with polo grounds, a racecourse and extensive shooting and fishing rights on the Tay. For many years it housed the Stone of Scone, which was used  for centuries in the coronation of Scottish kings. Prince Charles was a frequent visitor and Baroness Thatcher is a friend of Murray’s 81-year-old father and his wife Pamela, Countess of Mansfield, 76. The earl was a minister of state in the Scottish and Northern Ireland offices during the Thatcher years. Today, the running of the palace is left to Viscount Stormont, while Lady Georgina, 44, is a deputy lieutenant of Perth. As for their brother…well, he was . once placed third in a newspaper poll of Scotland’s 100 most eligible . men. But behind his glamorous image, chronicled in society magazines and . newspaper diary columns back in the nineties, he was always the black . sheep of the family. This is exemplified by an incident . when he was about 16 and Lady Thatcher, or Mrs Thatcher as she was then, . called on the earl and countess. Troubled: The flat in Oxford where the girl, who is now 17, used to visit James Murray with her friends to drink, smoke and play music . Privilege: Historic Scone Palace, Perthshire, Scotland, where James Murray grew up . Murray was banished from the house, it seems, and made to sit in a police van outside for the duration of the Prime Minister’s visit. The reason, apparently, was revealed by a police officer who ‘stood guard’ over him that day: ‘Nothing was expressly said, but we got the distinct impression that he could not be trusted to behave in company.’ After leaving school with few qualifications, he spent a number of years travelling and, at one time or another, was a sheep farmer and lumberjack in Australia. His bizarre early employment record since then is listed on his Facebook page and includes: cleansing operative (Scotland), ‘financial persuader’ (London), ‘Alcohol marketing’ (also London). Along the way, it emerged in court, he picked up two convictions for drug possession and one for drink driving. The earl thanked his parents, Lord and Lady Mansfield for their support during the trial . Convictions aside, it was a lifestyle unlikely to have impressed his father, a barrister, who has encouraged his children to ‘make their own way’ in life. That is perhaps why, aged 30, Murray enrolled on a computer course at Oxford Brookes University, formerly Oxford Polytechnic. Shortly afterwards, he set himself up as a freelance computer engineer in the city. His most recent address was a new rented two-bedroom flat in the suburbs, splitting his time between Oxford and Perth. Although he is not the eldest son, he has few financial worries. He is listed as a director (with his siblings) of a family-owned property company, which according to the latest accounts, has funds of £2.6million and cash reserves  of £1.7million. And he conforms to an all too familiar stereotype. ‘I think he could quite fairly be described as a bit of a “Hooray Henry”,’ says someone who bumped into him at a party back in Perth recently. ‘He was loud and lairy – living it up and going around with a bottle of champagne. I saw him pointing to a photographer and saying, “You there! Take my picture!”.’ In Oxford, Murray would casually drop his gilded background into the conversation, once telling a neighbour that he had to go back to ‘the palace’ in Scotland as ‘Prince Charles was coming to visit’. ‘We thought, “Goodness, he must be posh”,’ recalled a woman who lived in the same block. ‘He then showed me a photograph of his “house”. He said he really did live there and they had loads of servants.’ Shortly after Murray’s arrest, youngsters went on the rampage in the block where he lived, breaking windows, throwing paint over his car and spraying graffiti. He was asked to leave by the managing agents who discovered he had given a key to the teenage girl he was accused of assaulting. For the past year, he has been living with his sister at her turreted mansion not far from Scone Palace. A sign at the end of the driveway warns visitors: ‘Keep off the grass and dead slow. Children, Dogs, Hens, Bikes, Helicopters’.","Jury took less than an hour to clear The Hon James Murray, 42 .

A Chilean nanny is suing a wealthy New York City family over claims she was 'kept as a virtual slave' in their Upper East Side apartment, where she was denied adequate food and medication. Felicitas del Carmen Villanueva Garnica, 50 alleges she was locked in the socialite couple's Upper East Side apartment, physically abused by their three children and forced to work 12 hours a day for just $2 an hour for three months until she finally mustered the courage to leave. She says Malu Custer Edwards, 28, and Micky Hurley, 35, both from well-known families in Chile, brought her to the U.S. with a fake passport and had her lie to customs officials about her true intentions in the country. Accusations: Socialites Malu Custer Edwards, 29, left, and Mickey Hurley, 35, right, are being sued by their former nanny over claims she was forced to work under deplorable conditions . Villanueva claimed the New York Post that the couple often left her with only small slices of bread and milk to eat, while they were regulars at the exclusive French restaurant Balthazar - where entrees run $30 to $45. The couple denies Villaneuva's allegations and are fighting the lawsuit. 'The claims are completely without merit and will be fully refuted in court,' attorney Robin Alperstein told the Post. Villanueva finally fled the home in March 2011 after one of the children slammed her . head with a refrigerator door so hard that she nearly lost . consciousness, she alleges. Villanueva says she began working for Edwards and Hurley in Chile in December 2010. They decided to move to New York in January 2011 so Edwards could enroll the the New School. Villanueva says the couple told her they would pay her $10 an hour and give her health benefits if she came with them and looked after their three children, ages 6, 8 and 10. Upscale: The couple were regulars at the posh French restaurant Balthazar, while Felicitas del Carmen Villanueva Garnica claims she often had only milk and bread to eat . When she arrived in New York, though, she alleges the couple began paying her only $800 a month, allegedly claiming no nanny in New York makes more than $700 a month. She claims she worked 12 hours a day and had only one day off in three months. 'They brought me here to mistreat me,' Villanueva told the Post. 'They were telling me I don’t have any rights of any sort.' She claims in court documents the job amounted to 'forced labor' and 'involuntary servitude.' The Post says Villanueva was kept as a 'virtual slave.' She alleged in an interview with the Post that she begged to be sent back to Chile, but the couple refused to let her move home - saying she signed a two-year contract. Instead, she claims, she was often locked in rooms, forced to sleep on the floor. She says she was promised health care benefits, but the couple allegedly refused to let her refill her hypertension medication. Villaneuva said she was happy working for the couple when she lived in Chile, but it changed after they brought her to the U.S. on a fake passport. Edwards, a graphic designer, is related to Agustín Edwards McClure, a Chilean diplomat who led the League of Nations in 1922. Hurley, an interior decorator, is a descendant of the country’s founding settlers and related to opera set designer Pier Luigi Samaritani. 'All Chile knows them. They come from a family with lots of resources,' Villanueva said of Edwards' family. Despite the denials from Edwards and Hurley, the New York Department of Labor ordered the couple to pay Villanueva $6,302 in back wages in 2011.","Felicitas del Carmen Villanueva Garnica, 50, claims she was brought to the U.S. on an illegal passport and spent three months in 'forced labor' and 'involuntary servitude'

It's not wise to upset a Wookiee, as airport staff in Denver found out when they tried to take the Star Wars actor's walking cane as he boarded a flight. Security had mistaken his walking stick, fashioned to look like a light saber, as a weapon, as Peter Mayhew, 69, prepared to fly home from a sci-fi convention. But when the 7ft 2in actor took to Twitter to complain to his 22,000 followers, staff at Denver airport soon realized you should always let the Wookiee win. Grounded: Peter Mayhew, left, waits in a wheelchair after airport security staff confiscated his walking stick . The frustrating episode was played out on Twitter as Mayhew, who had been a guest at Denver Comic Con, tried to catch an American Airlines flight to his home in Boyd, Texas. 'Won’t allow me through the airport . with me cane! Giant man need giant cane. Small cane snap like toothpick. Besides, my lightsaber is just cool. I’d miss it,' the actor, who played Han Solo's co-pilot in the original Star Wars trilogy said. The British-born actor, who has been . spotted using a wheelchair at recent sci-fi conventions, is due to have . an operation on his knee later this year. He explained there was a delay in the . surgery because the 'largest replacement knees on the market are a size . ""6"", but this Wookiee needs a size ""11"",'. Concerned that he would miss the flight on Monday, last week, Mayhew pleaded with his followers: '@AmericanAir won't allow me through the airport with me cane! Can I get a retweet?' The farce is strong: Mayhew, who played Harrison Ford's sidekick in Star Wars, was stopped at the airport .

Four years ago, Mary Foord-Brown was in despair, afraid she was never going to find the right medical help for her two children. Branded an 'over-protective' mother who was 'inventing' illnesses for them, she had just been struck off by her GP surgery in Woodbridge, Suffolk. She had two sick children at home - Lilac, then 12, and Victor, ten - suffering from scarlet fever, and subsequently a form of pneumonia. This had come after a litany of other illnesses. Desperate: Turned away by her GP surgery, Mary Foord-Brown despaired over the health of her two children - until she discovered the Honorary Doctors' Association . 'Anyone could see they weren't well - they seemed exhausted and didn't pick up after normal childhood illnesses,' says Mary, 48, a charity volunteer who is married to Martin, 58, a psychologist. 'I took them to the GP a number of times, and eventually waited for the out-of-hours service to click in as I felt I got better care then. The children were both treated with antibiotics but neither seemed to be getting better. 'They needed to see a paediatric consultant but I couldn't get a referral.' Indeed, the GP surgery's response was a letter informing the family that 'due to a breakdown in relationships' they would no longer treat them. 'I felt as if the NHS washed its hands of us,' says Mary. Desperate, she called a private doctor, although she could not afford prolonged private treatment - and the secretary suggested she contact a new organisation, the Honorary Doctors' Association. This charity offers free advice and treatment from some of the most eminent private and NHS consultants and GPs in the country. It was set up four years ago by Marius van Oldenborgh, an ophthalmologist, to help people crying out for a second opinion after they have been failed or misdiagnosed by the NHS or private practice in the UK. 'Many of the people we see are genuinely in despair,' says Mr van Oldenborgh. 'We provide a lifeline which is free at the point of care. 'We do not see ourselves as operating “in competition” with the NHS and fully support its core principles. We are not a political organisation. We simply offer a second opinion. 'If an NHS doctor disagrees with our diagnosis, it's up to the patient to decide which advice to follow.At first I was concerned we might encounter opposition from doctors, but in fact we have been met with tremendous goodwill. 'We now have around 140 private and NHS doctors and consultants registered with us, but there are around 900 doctors in the UK I can ring and ask for advice, and so far no one has refused to help. Relief: Now that Mary and her children have been accurately diagnosed by the HDA, they can lead happy, normal lives . 'I have developed quite a thick skin in ringing up eminent consultants and saying: “Look, could you see this person for free?” The majority of doctors see their profession as a calling, and are frustrated by the limitations under which they have to work. 'Many GPs have only about eight minutes to see a patient, and some are seeing 60 patients a day. Almost inevitably there will be misdiagnosis, lack of knowledge and wrong treatments occurring.' The Honorary Doctors' Association (soon to be renamed the Patient Care Trust) was set up after Mr van Oldenborgh realised he was treating one in ten of his patients free, as they couldn't afford to pay him. 'I rang around other specialists and consultants and found many did the same. I thought if we formed ourselves into a network, we could offer this vital second opinion service.' He emailed 200 eminent consultants and doctors, and more than half replied immediately that they would become involved. Last year the charity helped almost 200 patients. Its helpline is manned by just Mr van Oldenborgh and a staff of two. 'I listen to their case, then call on my specialists and refer their cases on. Most patients can see a specialist within weeks. 'We see people who have exhausted every avenue in the NHS, been given inadequate explanations, insufficient follow-ups or have been misdiagnosed. Many could never afford to see a private doctor for a second opinion.' For Mary, the relief of being able to speak to a medical professional was 'immense'. 'Mr van Oldenborgh became an “umbrella” mentor for our care. He researched our case and made invaluable suggestions.' With the HDA's help, Mary discovered that she and her children suffer from an auto-immune condition, Hughes Syndrome (or 'sticky blood'), where the blood clots too quickly. Patients often have intense migraines - Victor is particularly prone to these, which also caused him to vomit; he used to suffer from blackouts, too. As well as Hughes Syndrome, Lilac and her mother have systemic lupus, another auto-immune condition, which causes joint pain and extreme fatigue. With the right diagnosis and care, the children now lead happy, normal lives. Victor, who takes daily aspirin and a drug called plaquenil, no longer has blackouts and both children are doing well at school - Victor is also schooled partly at home. Mary has found a new GP practice, which she describes as 'excellent', and  sees various paediatric experts. 'The HDA gave me a sense of security and professional support at a difficult time,' she says. For two years, Snehal Thakar, an IT consultant in the City, struggled to get specialist treatment for persistent and increasingly crippling pain above his knee, caused by a footballing injury. 'I was constantly fobbed off by my GP, who said the pain would go away, but it was getting progressively worse. He'd just give me more painkillers,' says the 45-year-old from Harrow, Middlesex. The pain became so excruciating that he couldn't walk more than 40 metres. 'I finally stood in my GP's surgery and said I would refuse to leave until I was referred to a consultant.' An orthopaedic consultant said - wrongly, it turned out - that the problem was fragments of bone in his ankle, and Snehal  had an operation to remove these. Lifeline: The Honorary Doctors' Association offers free advice and treatment from some of the most eminent private and NHS consultants and GPs in the country . When the pain persisted, an ultrasound scan - the first he'd been offered - revealed the real cause: a blood clot above his knee. 'My consultant said I might need an artery bypass but this wouldn't be available for at least two years.' A year later, with the pain badly affecting his daily life, Snehal was at the end of his tether. A colleague mentioned the HDA and he was referred to John Scurr, a world-leading vascular surgeon working privately in London. 'For the first time, I felt someone was really listening. He said if I'd been given the right treatment in the beginning it would have cleared the clot, but now it was too big and I would need a bypass. 'Having an eminent surgeon confirm the diagnosis was such a relief. He also recommended daily exercises that eased the pain. 'I'm now armed with expert knowledge to fight my case for a bypass operation on the NHS.' Retired nursery nurse Wendy Stokoe credits the HDA with saving her sight. Wendy, 63, from Billericay in Essex, had been taking strong painkillers for 15 years for back pain. Around four years ago, her sight started deteriorating. 'My GP said it was glaucoma. Gradually, my sight became worse and worse and I could only see a pinpoint of light. I couldn't drive, I could barely read and hardly left the house. I was told there was nothing that could be done.' Mary went to Marius van Oldenborgh. 'I said I couldn't afford lengthy private treatment, and he said he'd treat me for free. 'He investigated tirelessly, and finally told me he didn't think it was glaucoma but a toxic build-up from the painkillers. He advised me to stop taking one, and gave me daily B12 vitamin injections . 'Over a matter of months, my eyesight began to return. I firmly believe that but for the work of the HDA, I would be blind.' The HDA is 'only a small organisation', says Mr van Oldenborgh, 'but we are growing all the time'. He adds: 'We don't feel we hold all the answers, but we do our best to help. With the patient's permission, we like to write to their GP saying what we would recommend.' For Mary, the crucial thing was that an expert was really listening. 'I felt, for the first time in years, as if someone actually cared.'

The workhouse was the institution you ended up in when things really couldn't get any worse. To enter one of the foreboding Victorian buildings - where even the architecture, it seems, was designed to intimidate - was the ultimate dread. Inmates (and what else to call them?) may have been fed and clothed, but the conditions were often barbaric and the fate of those who entered ultimately tragic. Uncovering secrets: Felicity Kendall looks at and old black and white photograph of her relatives . And a shocking number of our ancestors were among them. In the opening minutes of a new documentary, Secrets From The Workhouse, we learn that one in ten Britons has a family connection to these places. More than 500 were built in the 50 years following the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act, which made it compulsory for those seeking government relief from poverty to enter the workhouse. But the governments of the day didn't want to promote them as havens of shelter. Instead, they made them as terrifying as possible. Those entering had to relinquish all personal items - even clothes - and undertake backbreaking work such as breaking stones for ten hours a day, six days a week. Men were separated from their wives; children from their parents. Quite how many of us have the workhouse etched somewhere on the family tree is brought home by the range of celebrities taking part in this harrowing programme, tracing their own ancestors' steps into these hellholes. Actress Felicity Kendal clearly had no idea what skeletons lay in her family closet, and when she delves into the past of her great-grandmother, Mary Liddell, she discovers a woman who ended up, shamed and ostracised by society, in the workhouse - not once but twice. Endless toil: Women in the refectory of Saint Pancras workhouse, 1895 . Mary had married her husband John Liddell in 1880 and bore him nine children. Her tenth child, however, was the result of an illicit affair and - as was common at the time - Mary was cast out of the family home and ended up in a Cumbrian workhouse, where her son Albert, Felicity's great-uncle, was born. She was, it emerges, branded a woman of ill-repute and low morals. Pregnant adulterers like Mary were forced to wear special uniforms with yellow and black stripes, designed to shame. With mounting horror, Felicity discovers her great-grandmother bore not one but two illegitimate children - pretty much sealing her fate as a fallen woman. At one point, poring over the archives, she shakes her head in disbelief. 'This woman is extraordinary,' she says. She manages a smile - delivered along with an expletive - before concluding, 'She's a goer, isn't she?' Later, discovering that one child dies and another is taken into care, she makes a poignant pilgrimage to an unmarked grave. 'It's heartbreaking.' Novelist Barbara Taylor Bradford is similarly upset, her features becoming more and more pinched as she discovers exactly what her mother Freda would have gone through as a six-year-old child, brought to a workhouse by her own mother. Freda never told Barbara she'd been there. It was a secret too terrible to tell even her own family. The multi-millionaire novelist only made the discovery when her biographer went searching for historical records. 'When I found out I burst into tears,' she admits. 'My mother had been such a sweet person. I couldn't imagine her in a workhouse. It begged the question, “Why?”' By the end - discovering why her mother never mentioned any of this awful past - she is weeping openly. Then there's actor Brian Cox, whose great-grandfather ended up in the Scottish equivalent of the workhouse, the poorhouse. At one point Brian looks as if he might punch the poor archivist charged with breaking the news of how brutally his family was treated by the authorities. 'B******s!' he declares, as the full horror of his family history is laid bare. His great-grandfather Patrick McCann was an Irish immigrant who set up home in Glasgow with his wife in the late 1800s. They had eight children; five didn't survive their early years. Skeletons in the closet: Presenter Fern Britton discovers both her great-great-great-grandfather and his son died in the workhouse . Cox stands in front of the tenement where the family would have lived alongside 40 or 50 other people. So cramped were the conditions that each family had to share one bed. 'It just leaves you... it's really bad,' he says, his voice faltering. Brian's journey to discover what became of Patrick McCann makes for difficult viewing. 'Unbearable!' he says as the pieces are put together. Patrick first seeks sanctuary in a poorhouse in 1899 when his son Samuel falls ill with bronchitis, but the stay is only a short one. Records show he's back in 1901, desperately ill himself. He's discharged again, but is back almost every year thereafter. For 14 years he boomerangs in and out of the poorhouse, at one point - despite medical records showing he's a very ill man - being branded a 'malingerer', until in 1911 he's declared insane. 'There's this endless spiral into the abyss, until finally he goes nuts,' says Brian, incredulous. 'It was a harsh system, horrible. It's an absolute outrage what they did to these people.' Presenter Fern Britton discovers her great-great-great-grandfather, a man who went by the wonderful name of Friend Carter, managed to avoid the workhouse until he was 91 years of age. His son Jesse wasn't so lucky, however. In 1879 Jesse, then 23, fell ill and ended up in a workhouse in Kent. Jesse didn't survive, but what happened to his body reduces Fern to tears. If a family couldn't afford to pay for a burial, the authorities had the right to hold onto it for medical research. It would have caused the family great anguish, Fern learns, because of beliefs about the afterlife at the time. She is visibly distraught. 'I always thought of the Victorians as great philanthropists, God-fearing and kind. Yet if you were living in poverty at that time, you were penalised for it.' Friend Carter also died in the dreaded workhouse, but somehow the family managed to scrape together the money to take his body back home for burial - a happy ending, of sorts, for Fern, who greets the news with tears pouring down her cheeks. The grim days of the workhouse may now be consigned to history, but this show underlines how recent that history is - and how close in other ways too. 'One of my greatest fears has always been poverty,' Brian Cox admits. 'Now maybe I know why. You begin to realise it's in the DNA.' Secrets From The Workhouse will be on ITV on Tuesday 25 June at 9pm.","Celebrities in the show trace their ancestors' lives in workhouses .

International Space Station (ISS) crew activities in Russia, including . the training and crew support staff. It was in Russia that Chris trained . to become a fully qualified  flight engineer cosmonaut for the Soyuz TMA . spacecraft, and performed 'space-walks' in the Russian Orlan spacesuit. In 2003, Chris retired as a Colonel . from the Canadian Air Force (after 25 years of military service), to be a . civilian CSA astronaut. Until 2006 he was based in Houston, Texas, eventually being chief of International Space Station Operations until 2008. Chris announced on his biography webpage, that he would retire from the CSA as of July 4, 2013 'to take up new challenges'. The announcement comes less than a . month after his final space mission safely touched down to Earth, . following five months' work on the International Space Station (ISS).

November 1995 Hadfield served as Mission Specialist 1 on STS-74, NASA's second space shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir. During the flight, the crew of Space Shuttle Atlantis attached a five-tonne docking module to Mir and transferred over 1,000 kg of food, water, and scientific supplies to the cosmonauts. Hadfield flew as the first Canadian mission specialist, the first Canadian to operate the Canadarm in orbit, and the only Canadian to ever board Mir.April 2001 Hadfield served as Mission Specialist 1 on STS-100 International Space Station (ISS) assembly Flight 6A. The crew of Space Shuttle Endeavour delivered and installed Canadarm2, the new Canadian-built robotic arm, as well as the Italian-made resupply module Raffaello. During the 11-day flight, Hadfield performed two spacewalks, which made him the first Canadian to ever leave a spacecraft and float freely in space. In total, Hadfield spent 14 hours, 54 minutes outside, travelling 10 times around the world.From 2008-09 Hadfield served as the backup for Dr. Bob Thirsk for Expedition 20/21, a long-duration spaceflight, training to live and work on board the ISS for a period up to six months. After this assignment, he supported the ISS Operations Branch and developed Emergency procedures for the ISS.May 2010 Hadfield was the Commander of NEEMO 14, a NASA undersea mission to test exploration concepts living in an underwater facility off the Florida coast. NEEMO 14 used the ocean floor to simulate exploration missions to the surface of asteroids, moons and Mars in order to gain a better understanding of how astronaut crews interact with equipment including advanced spacesuits, a lander, a rover and robotic arms.June 2010Hadfield was part of the Pavilion Lake research team, located 420km northeast of Vancouver. Pavilion Lake is one of the few places on Earth where microbialites are found. The team used a combination of remotely operated vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, SCUBA divers and DeepWorker submersibles to help understand how the microbialites formed and possibly make it easier to identify potential forms of extraterrestrial life on future missions to Mars.September 2010Chris Hadfield was assigned to Expedition 34/35. On December 19, 2012 he launched aboard the Russian Soyuz, en route to becoming the second Canadian to take part in a long-duration spaceflight aboard the ISS. On March 13, 2013 he became the first Canadian to command a spaceship as Commander of the ISS during the second portion of his five-month stay in space. On May 13, Hadfield, Tom Marshburn and Roman Romanenko landed in Kazakhstan after travelling almost 99.8 million kilometres while completing 2,336 orbits of Earth.

Powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on Mars has been found by one of Nasa’s aging rover vehicles. Evidence of water of Mars has been indicated by a succession of discoveries on Mars but until now they have all suggested flows of sulphuric acid. This is the first time water has been found in a form that is likely to be drinkable. The discovery boosts the chances that one of life’s most important building blocks was once present  on the planet, and might even still be there. Opportunity found traces of a clay mineral on Mars thought to have been formed by a reaction with water. Esperance is a metre-square area on a crater rim and the spot marked Esperance6 in this false colour image is where the sample was taken. It was hailed by a leading NASA scientist as one of the most important yet made by the Mars Opportunity rover, which is approaching the tenth anniversary of its launch. The find that has so excited the team behind the Opportunity mission is chemical analysis of a small rock which included a clay mineral, montmorillonite, that is likely to have been formed by water with a neutral ph. ‘This is powerful evidence the water interacted with this rock and changed its chemistry,’ said Professor Steve Squyres, of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Cornell University. ‘Clay minerals only tend to form at a more neutral pH. This is water you could drink. This is water that was much more favourable for things like pre-biotic chemistry - the kind of chemistry that could lead to the origin of life. Montmorillonite exists on Earth where it is known to be formed from a reaction with igneous rocks. The rock that was analysed by Opportunity by its alpha particle X-ray spectrometer and microscopic imager once the rock abrasion tool had obtained a clean sample inside a square meter test area called Esperance within a region known as Cape York on the rim of a 14-mile wide crater, Endeavour. Opportunity has travelled 22.5 miles since landing on Mars in January 2004 on what was expected to be a three-month mission. It started its explorations at Eagle crater, just 72-feet across, and worked its way up to the 14-mile wide Endeavour crater. Signals beamed back to earth revealed to waiting scientists that it was a rock like no other yet tested by Opportunity. ‘We’ve been discovering evidence of water on Mars since we landed in 2004,’ said Professor Squyres. ‘The vast majority of them point to water that was at a very low ph – it was acid. We run around talking ‘water on Mars, water on Mars’. In fact, what Opportunity has mostly found evidence for is sulphuric acid on Mars. ‘What we have here has a very different chemistry. Clay minerals like montmorillonite only tend to form at a more neutral ph. The rock, Esperance, that showed signs of drinking water once being on Mars, was within an area known as Cape York. The rover reached the area in August 2011 and explored it for more than 20 months, leaving in May this year. The while line shows the route. 'This is the most powerful evidence for neutral chemisty water that has been found by Opportunity.’ He added: ‘To me right now I would say what we have found with Esperance has sort of vaulted into my personal top five for the whole nine-and-a-half year mission. This is a good one. 'Esperance was so important, we committed several weeks to getting this one measurement of it, even though we knew the clock was ticking. ‘What's so special about Esperance is that there was enough water not only for reactions that produced clay minerals, but also enough to flush out ions set loose by those reactions, so that Opportunity can clearly see the alteration.’ A digitally enhanced image providing a 3D view of the route Opportunity has taken since leaving the Esperance rock. It took 20 Martian days to get from the rock to the spot shown as 'Sol 3327' where it was on June 3. Sol 1 was the day Opportunity landed on Mars. Scientists are confident the spectrometer has revealed signs of water with a neutral ph because of the high proportion of aluminium detected by the spectrometer compared to other chemicals including iron, magnesium and calcium. The rover has now been instructed by its controllers to head towards Solander Point, another part of the rim of Endeavour, having spent two years exploring Cape York. The Opportunity rover is now on its way to Solander Point, just over a mile away, to investigate more geological features. This false colour image highlights some of the ancient rock formations that it will have to negotiate. Opportunity was launched on July 7, 2003 . and landed on January 25, 2004 for what was originally expected to be a . three-month mission. Opportunity travelled 283 million miles to reach Mars after its launch in 2003. Its sister rover, Spirit, reached the planet three weeks earlier. NASA lost touch with Spirit in March 2010 after it got stuck in soft ground. Opportunity was the first to find evidence of water on the planet, within three months of starting operations. It has travelled more than 36km and its motor has made 70 million revolutions, seven time more than were guaranteed by the manufacturer. Its performance, however, exceeded all expectations and while the rover is today described as ‘arthritic’, with a ‘gimpy shoulder’ and a memory that is showing the first signs of failing, it is still operational and making amazing findings. John Callas, the project manager for the Mars rover expeditions, said Opportunity is in ‘remarkably good health’ but added: ‘We’ve been on borrowed time for a while.’ One of the rover’s flash memories is showing signs of ‘amnesia’ he said but while it is proving an ‘occasional annoyance’ it is not yet a serious threat to the mission. He emphasised that the rover is operating in a ‘very hostile environment’ with extreme temperature fluctuation.‘The Rover could have a catastrophic failure at any moment,’ he added. ‘Every day is a gift.’","Clay mineral formed in a reaction with water is detected by spectrometer .

The follow up to last year's smash hit, Halo 4, it is part of an . ever-growing Halo franchise that includes a live-action series. Xbox Live Gold . members  will also be two free games per month, including Halo 3 and . Assassins Creed 2, E3 attendees heard. Microsoft announced Project Spark - a smart glass enabled game that allows you to create gaming worlds. The game, exclusive to Xbox One and Windows 8, it gives gamers a blank canvass to create their own gaming experience. Attendees await the start of the Microsoft Xbox E3 2013 Media Briefing in Los Angeles. At the event, bosses confirmed the new console will cost $499 or £429 - and the Xbox 360 will be updated to look more like an Xbox One . From flying goblins to huge mechanical robots, Spark gives gamers an infinite number of possibilities. It was also revealed that Xbox Live will no longer limited to 100 friends and that Microsoft points will be scrapped in favour of real money. Phil Spencer, corporate vice president, Microsoft Studios, said: 'Microsoft Studios is committed to making Xbox One the best place to play games, with more titles in development and more exclusives coming than at any time in the history of Xbox. 'With amazing games such as Forza Motorsport 5, Ryse: Son of Rome, Dead Rising 3, Halo Xbox One, Kinect Sports Rivals, Project Spark and Quantum Break, Xbox will continue to lead the industry with the biggest exclusives, new IP and blockbuster franchises that will delight gamers for the next decade and beyond.' Microsoft Corp. said in a blog post . last Thursday that it will not charge a fee to retailers, publishers or . gamers for transferring their old games. The new Xbox 360 product was also launched today at the conference in an attempt to maintain strong sales of the ageing consoles . This means used games will be able to . be played, clearing up a worry among gamers and video game retailers . such as GameStop, which trade in used games. That means video games discs users . buy will not be limited to one Xbox One device, and players can share or . trade in the games they have bought for other used games, just as they . have been able to do in the past. The Xbox One,will need to be . connected online at least once every 24 hours to work. Some players had . been concerned that the console was going to require a constant Internet . connection. Users will be able to access their . games from other consoles through an online library after installing . them on their primary device, but they will need to connect to the . Internet at least every hour. They will be able to watch live TV and . Blu-ray and DVD movies on the Xbox One without an Internet connection, . Microsoft said. The Xbox One has been redesigned with sleeker lines. It has kept the trademark black plastic casing and green lighting. The new console has USB 3.0 connections and an HDMI In/Out port and 500GB of storage as standard . When unveiling details of the Xbox One last month, Microsoft said it would be completely . controlled using voice recognition and hand gestures, and with the new .

Education Secretary Michael Gove has stripped Doncaster Council of its powers to run chilldren's services . A council that is under scrutiny after two small boys endured a torture ordeal by two brothers in its foster care system will lose the power to run children's services. Doncaster Council will have to outsource all its child social services on the orders of Education Secretary Michael Gove, pending a final decision on the authority at the end of May, reports The Times. In 2009 two small children were were strangled, hit with bricks, made to eat nettles, stripped and forced to sexually abuse each other in a 90-minute attack by two brothers aged 11 and 12 in the authority's care. The older boy was seriously injured when a piece of ceramic sink was dropped on his head. Sentencing them in 2010, Mr Justice Keith described the crimes as 'truly exceptional'. They were carried out 'for no reason other than that you got a real kick out of hurting and humiliating them', he said. The brothers, who have not been named, were handed indefinite terms with a minimum tariff of five years over the 'appalling' attack in Edlington, near Doncaster. A full report, which was leaked to the BBC, revealed how over 14 years nine agencies were involved with the family of the brothers and between them they missed 31 chances to intervene. Ministers appointed a team to turn around Doncaster Council's poor record - it was judged inadequate by Ofsted in 2008 - and it appointed a new director from another council, but after a small improvement standards once again fell. Experts including Alan Wood, director of children's services in Hackney, and Julian Le Grand, Professor of Social Policy at the London School of Economics, are in charge of drawing up plans to improve the situation. Town Mayor Peter Davies said: 'There have been significant improvements in our services but I have always made it clear that we still have a long way to go and need to accelerate the pace of change.' Gove's decision to force the council to bring in an outside agency is only the second time powers allowing a council to have key responsibilities taken away have been used. Hackney has only just had schools returned to its control after it was stripped of the responsibility in 2002 after a series of poor inspections. Doncaster Council's HQ.

The opportunity to gain a college education - and therefore better job prospects - is increasingly beyond the means of many Americans, claims a new report from the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Their research shows that college fees have soared over the past 30 years, while the median family income has remained almost stagnant once inflation is taken into account. Since 1982 inflation-adjusted costs at four-year private non-profit schools have jumped a staggering 250percent, while costs at public four-year colleges have increased more than 150percent. College costs have risen steadily over the past 30 years, while median family income has remained flat . The universities blaming rising fees on record-high enrollments, a workforce of professors who have the skills to find work elsewhere if they are not well paid, and falling financial support from state government . Private colleges currently charge an average of more than $30,000 a year, yet 2011 census results showed only half of American households earning more than $50,000. The universities claim they're caught between record-high enrollments, a workforce of professors who have the skills to find work elsewhere if they are not well paid, and falling financial support from state governments, reports Voice of America. The CAP report has warned that ‘almost two-thirds of jobs in our economy will [soon] require some type of education or training beyond high school.’ Current figures already show that college graduates roughly earn three times that of high school dropouts and that the unemployment rate amongst graduates is almost half the national rate. Drawn by low tuition U.S. students are flocking to Canadian schools like McGill University . Canadian schools like McMaster University have a combined 10,000 American students . Here are a sampling of tuition prices at some comparable Canadian and U.S. universities .

Over the last ten years, the number of American students at Canadian colleges rose 50 per cent. Today, . approximately 10,000 Americans are enrolled at Canadian schools, . according to the Institute for College Access & Success. At McGill University in Montreal, about six per cent of the student body is American. And the numbers are growing. In comparison to colleges like McGill, American students carry an average of more than $26,000 in debt and roughly nine per cent of those grads will default on those loans within two years of graduation. Tuition is the largest cost of attending school in the U.S. Eric Andreasen, 23, will graduate this spring with a political science major from McGill.

Soon you may be able to simply raise your hand or nod your head from another room, and you’ll be moments away from a fresh cup of tea. This is the hope of researchers at the University of Washington who have developed technology that will allow people to control household devices with simple gestures. The technology, named ‘WiSee’, is similar in concept to how Microsoft's Xbox Kinect sensor works by using cameras to recognise gestures. Scroll down for video . A hand gesture changes the TV channel using WiSee technology. The system detects the changes in the electromagnetic waves of Wi-Fi signals as they reflect off a moving human body . By adapting a Wi-Fi router and wireless . household devices, the researchers developed a system that can detect specific . movements without the need for sensors or cameras. They claim it is simpler and cheaper than similar gesture-recognition technologies. WiSee works using the Doppler effect - the way a wave of sound or light changes frequency at the point it is observed depending on the source of the wave’s movements. A common example of the Doppler effect is the change in pitch of an ambulance siren as it passes. A standard Wi-Fi router can be adapted to function as a receiver. This . receiver then listens to all of the wireless transmissions coming from . devices throughout a home, including smartphones, laptops and tablets. When a person moves, there is a slight change in the frequency of the wireless signal. Moving a hand or foot causes the receiver to detect a pattern of changes known as the Doppler frequency shift. These . frequency changes are very small – only several hertz – when compared . with Wi-Fi signals that have a 20 megahertz bandwidth and operate at 5 . gigahertz. An algorithm to . detect these slight shifts and the system also accounts for gaps in . wireless signals when devices aren’t transmitting. If a person wants to use the WiSee, they would perform a specific repetition gesture sequence to get access to the receiver. Once . the wireless receiver locks onto the user, they can perform normal . gestures to interact with the devices and appliances in her home. The researchers tested these gestures with five users in a two-bedroom apartment and an office environment. Out of the 900 gestures performed, WiSee accurately recognised 94 per cent of them. It was found that as many as five people can move simultaneously in the same room without confusing the receiver.

They have set the standard for superhero games to follow and now the latest addition to Rocksteady Studio's Arkham saga has been announced. Set before 2009's Arkham Asylum, Batman: Arkham Origins follows a younger Batman who has been targeted by assassins on Christmas Eve. Look who's back: Batman is coming to current-gen consoles on October 25 . Plot explores Bruce Wayne's rocky relationship with Alfred Pennyworth, who has been a father figure since his parents death. It also introduces new villains such as Deathstroke, Black Mask, Anarky and Alberto Falcone. The Joker, Penguin, Bane and Deadshot are set to return. Not returning is long-standing Batman voice actor, Kevin Conroy. Roger Craig Smith, who voiced Assassin's Creed's Ezio Auditore has taken over the role. Gameplay is very similar to the other games, centering around gadget-based hand-to-hand combat. Old favourites including the Crytographic scanner, explosive gel and various Batarangs feature as well as new gadgets. The Remote Claw, for example, allows Batman to pull enemies and objects towards him or create a tightrope for him to traverse. Fighting fit: The famed counter system will be returning along with a host of new gadgets . Combat is now tracked and experience points are awarded for strong combination attacks. Upgrades to abilities and gadgets are unlocked depending on your XP. Whereas most enemies in the last game could be taken down easily, Origins introduces a new enemy type that can counter Batman's moves. Batman can also call in the Batwing to fast travel to different locations. Some areas are patrolled by tower installations that have to be disabled before Batman can summon the Batwing there. There are also plenty of side missions including 'Crime in Progress', where Batman can assist Gotham City Police in tackling crime and improve his reputation. 'Most Wanted' missions see the Dark Knight hunting specific villains, such as Anarky, throughout the city. Crimes can be reviewed on the Batcomputer and at the Batcave and can be viewed from various angles and speeds to ensure that no clues are missed. All right on the Knight: Plot explores the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Alfred and introduces a host of new villains . It's powered by Unreal 3, the same engine behind its predecessors. There is no word yet on whether Origins will be next-gen compatible. A Vita and 3DS spin-off called Batman: Arkham Origins: Blackgate is also penned for release and is being developed in parallel. It uses a different engine - a modified version of Blueprint. Batman: Arkham Origins set for release on October 25.

The world's oldest tumour has been discovered in the rib of a Neanderthal who lived around 130,000 years ago. Scientists at the University of Kansas took X-rays of the inch-long rib fragments - first found in the Krapina rock shelters of Croatia - and discovered parts of the inner bone were missing. Following CT scans the scientists discovered that this was likely to have been caused by soft-tissue tumour known in modern-day patients as fibrous dysplasia. Scans found that a small part of the inner bone network was missing and had been 'eaten away' by a soft-tissue tumour. This condition is called fibrous dysplasia . Fibrous dysplasia is an abnormal bone growth where normal bone is replaced with soft fibrous bone tissue. It can cause abnormal growth or . swelling of the bone. Although it can occur in any part of the . skeleton the soft tumours are most commonly found in the skull, thigh, shin, ribs, upper . arm and pelvis . Fibrous dysplasia is not cancerous but is rare and there is no known cure. The disorder is usually diagnosed in childhood or early adulthood. Males and females of any race are equally affected. The bones studied by Kansas university anthropologist David Frayer and his team were first excavated more than 100 years ago in Croatia. The site, known as the Krapina rock shelter, in the north of the country held more than 900 Neanderthal bones dating back from between 120,000 and 130,000 years ago. Frayer wanted to scan the bones because many of them showed signs of trauma and marks that happened after the neanderthal had died. Many of the 900 neanderthal bones found in Croatia had evidence of trauma or possible bite marks. This scan taken during the 1980s by researchers in Pennsylvania has a white area of overexposure which was the first evidence that a tumour had 'eaten away' the bone . The detailed scans show exactly where the bone has been 'eaten away' These marks suggest either cannibalism or burial rituals. Researchers . from the University of Pennsylvania took X-rays of the bones during the . 1980s and published a book containing all the radiographs. One of the inch-long rib fragments was shown to have sections of bone that were 'burned out' in the X-ray images. 'Burned out' sections of X-rays suggest over exposure, and in the rib bones this overexposure was caused by missing bone in the inner part of the fragment. Frayer used these images as a guide to take new, higher-resolution X-rays of the specimens. His team also scanned the bones using high-resolution microCT scanners that doctors currently use on modern-day patients. The microCT scan found that the 'spongy bone' which should be on the inner part of the fragment was missing and may have been 'eaten away' by a soft-tissue tumour. This type of tumour is seen in modern-day patients and is called fibrous dysplasia. Fibrous dysplasia is an abnormal bone growth where normal bone is replaced with fibrous bone tissue. It can cause abnormal growth or swelling of the bone and although it can occur in any part of the skeleton, it is most commonly found in the skull, thigh, shin, ribs, upper arm and pelvis . Fibrous dysplasia is not cancerous but is rare and there is no known cure. Frayer reported the findings in the journal PLOS ONE. He told LiveScience: 'People . of that time didn't live as long as they did today; plus, there weren't . very many of them compared to the Egyptians and people today. 'Finding evidence of tumors and evidence of cancers, is - . I don't know if I want to say ""lucky"" - but there isn't a lot of . evidence for it.' It was previously thought that climate change and a reduction in tree cover forced early man to stand up, but now experts believe the rocky African landscape played a far more significant role . Describing the type of tumour that was found, Frayer added: 'They range all the way from being totally benign, where you wouldn’t . recognize them, to being extremely painful. 'The size . of this one, and the bulging of it, probably caused the individual . pain.' Previously the earliest known tumours were found in Egyptian mummies dating back 4,000 years so this discovery predates this find significantly. A study released earlier this month discovered that Neanderthals lost out to homo sapiens in the battle to survive because they were not clever enough to adapt. The . results showed that . modern man walked the planet much earlier than was believed and Neanderthals died out much sooner than was estimated. Neanderthals had larger eyes than Homo sapiens but did not develop brain power in the same way. This meant that Homo sapiens were able to outsmart and ultimately outlive Neanderthals who had to use their brains more for physical rather than mental needs . Neanderthals breastfed their babies for over a year - just like humans, according to new research. Chemical . analysis of a neanderthal child's tooth reveal it was reared on . mother's milk for seven months with suckling continuing for the same . period coupled with solid food. The . change from breastfeeding to plants and grains can be established by . looking at differences in the distribution of barium – a similar . compound to calcium -  in teeth enamel. This . enabled Dr Manish Arora and colleagues at Mount Sinai School of . Medicine in New York to discover the early life diet of a 10 to 12 . year-old child that lived in a cave in Belgium around 100,000 years ago. The . brains of Neanderthals were the same size as those of modern man but . more of it was used to focus on the physical needs of their larger . bodies. Researchers from the University of York additionally found that early man began to walk on two feet because of rocky terrain and not climate change. The study found that our upright gait may . have its origins in the rugged landscape of East and South Africa which . was shaped during the Pliocene epoch by volcanoes and shifting tectonic . plates. Hominins, human's early ancestors, would . have been attracted to the terrain of rocky outcrops and gorges because . it offered shelter and opportunities to trap prey. But it also required . more upright scrambling and climbing gaits, prompting the emergence of . bipedalism.","Rib is up to 130,000 years old and was found in a cave in Krapina, Croatia .

A pregnant woman has revealed that bosses at a T-Mobile Call Center forced her to clock out every time she needed to use the restroom after her doctor had ordered her to drink more water. Prior to getting pregnant with her second child, Kristi Rifkin had been working at the call center in Nashville, Tennessee for four years and had always loved her job. But she claims the company's behavior towards her changed once she become pregnant. Kristi Rifkin has revealed that bosses at a T-Mobile Call Center in Nashville, Tennessee forced her to clock out every time she needed to use the restroom while she was pregnant . Rifkin’s second pregnancy proved to be a difficult one. She was required to take medication to prevent her going into labor early and each week she had to visit both a regular and a high-risk obstetrician. As a result of her condition she was advised to drink lots of water which, in turn, resulted in increased trips to the bathroom. This didn’t sit well with her employer which has a strict policy about breaks and allows employees only two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. In addition, workers have to stick . rigidly to something known as 'adherence' - a metric that measures the . degree to which employees meet their quota for being on the phone. 'You have different numbers you have to meet each month, and if you don’t meet them they can fire you,' explained Rifkin in a blog post on Moms Rising.org. 'The thinking is that if you’re off . the phone and you’re not doing what you’re supposed to be doing, then . there are customers waiting to talk to you.' Kristi Rifkin pictured with her family including baby Ian, back to camera, who was born in May 2010 . Rifkin did her best to comply with company rules as she desperately needed the health insurance the job provided. She drank less water than she was supposed to, but her doctor warned her it wasn't good for her baby so she start drinking more . which resulted in increased restroom visits. Eventually a supervisor pulled her aside and told her to get a note from her doctor explaining that she needed to go to the bathroom regularly throughout the day. But when Rifkin went to the HR department to get her note cleared she was told that she would have to clock out to go to the bathroom and then clock back in on her return. She also had to write her hours down and . show her supervisor who wanted to ensure she wasn’t . taking advantage of the situation. 'I ended up using my vacation time to use the bathroom and to go to doctor's appointments,' said Rifkin, who admits she felt victimized, stressed and anxious about her situation. The extra scrutiny wasn't helping with her pregnancy either and her blood pressure skyrocketed. Her doctor finally decided the best course of action was to put her on unpaid leave under the Family Medical Leave Act, which requires an employer to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to eligible employees. Seven weeks later her son, Ian, was born, on May 14, 2010. A month and a half after she returned to work only to be summarily fired. She received no severance pay and lost her medical insurance as a result. Rifkin says she was told it was because she had failed to remove an extra-charge feature from a customer’s account, the commission for which was 12 cents. T-Mobile spokesperson Glenn A. Zaccara told ABC News that he couldn't comment on a specific individual. 'T-Mobile employees enjoy . generous benefits including paid-time-off and short and long-term . disability coverage,' he said in an email statement. 'The company has . leave of absence policies in line with regulatory requirements.' Despite advice that Rifkin has a strong case to argue for 'pregnancy discrimination,' she says she has no plans to sue the company as it’s too expensive and Tennessee is an at-will employment state.","Kristi Rifkin claims bosses at a T-Mobile Call Center in Tennessee made life difficult for her during her second pregnancy .

'My worry is that it will happen again or that someone coming out of the pub across the road could walk up there and get more seriously hurt.' However Metrolink responded by saying that there had not been an issue for 'the vast majority of motorists'. Peter Cushing, TfGM's Metrolink director, said: 'The clear signage we've put in place near tram tracks to advise motorists is based on sound, industry-standard principles and best practice - and has been agreed with Manchester council. 'We understand that changes to the road layout can be confusing and appreciate that the changes will involve a period of adjustment and familiarisation for drivers. 'Considering how many cars pass through the area on any given day, we do not believe it is an issue for the vast majority of motorists.' The track runs along the main road before bearing left away from the main carriageway.

Despite his insistence that the website was satirical and that he has a great relationship with 95 per cent of customers, Watson's boss Seth Levy fired him after he was outed by a website in Portland. Watson, who earns $15 an hour and starts work at 6 a.m. to support his hip hop dreams as the act 'Spekulation', started getting thousands of hits after setting the blog live. Outed: Matt Watson has been named as a blogger who wrote scathing posts about his job as a barista . Handiwork: The Bitter Barista blog garnered thousands of hits after it was launched two weeks ago . 'If you remind me four times that you’ve ordered decaf, guess what you won’t be getting...' he wrote. 'What a coincidence! You have a gluten allergy, and I don’t care that you have a gluten allergy!' another message read. 'Lemme know where you work and I'll be sure to stop in early tomorrow morning to tell you how to do your job too,' another bitter post said. And targeting his boss, he added: 'I like to use a lot of big words when I . tweet, that way if my boss ever finds my twitter account, he won’t . understand any of it.' After he set the blog live, it started attracting thousands of hits a day - but it also attracted the attention of Zachary Carlsen and Jordan Michelman of coffee gossip website Sprudge.com. You're fired: He has now been fired from All Star Coffee in Seattle, where he had worked for two years . On a post . last Thursday, they named Watson as the barista behind the blog after . noticing his Spekulation Twitter account linked to his 'new blog' - . Bitter Barista. 'My . ex-boss thinks the website is gonna stop because I don't work there . anymore. Man, I didn't even work there when I worked there!' 'Don't cry over spilled milk? I'm not crying about the milk! Do you see where I work?!' 'I really hope this coffee career takes off so I can finally stop making music' 'Lemme know where you work and I'll be sure to stop in early tomorrow morning to tell you how to do your job too' 'You can say '2% milk' all damn day. You're getting whole milk . 'I would remember your usual drink if you were a more memorable person' 'If you bring your dog into the cafe and it starts fighting with another dog, you can't be that upset with me when I start taking bets' 'Oh, you want THAT blueberry scone, noth THIS blueberry scone? Well, don't worry, that doesn't make me hate you at all' 'There's . a lot of anger in this blog,' it wrote. 'While we love the well-worn . barista cliche, it should be the stuff of mild parody, not an all-out . assault on whomever walks through the door of your cafe.' Watson . emailed Levy after the Sprudge post, explaining that 'the very few . customers who have seen the website, are huge fans', according to the Seattle Times. 'I'm just saying it could turn out to be a fun something that gives the place a little spike in publicity,' he wrote - but his boss did not see it that way. 'He was writing about his boss during business hours,' Levy said. 'I represent the business, the customers and the staff. I can’t endorse what he was saying, whether humorous or not.' Despite Watson's messages, he told the Times he thought highly of his boss and the majority of the customers who came to the coffee shop. He was just referencing 'the five percent who I guess make our job . more difficult and don’t treat us as human beings,' he said. In fact, when you see a barista, 'that person is probably an artist, overqualified, people with pretty much college education across the board', he said. As well as his work as a hip hop artist, Watson, who is married, has a bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Lehigh University in Pennsylvania. Real passion: He worked as a barista to support his passion - performing as hip hop artist, Spekulation . Not the end: Watson, 30, said he has been offered jobs by several other coffee houses . While he said his boss had 'every right' to fire him, he was less understanding of the bloggers who outed him on Sprudge.com. 'It's actually like the Twitter coffee culture which is why I was so surprised that I was targetted and they just didn't understand that it was satirical,' he told Kiro7 in Seattle. 'The guys who wrote the article compared me to one of the Columbine shooters which is like really crazy.' Despite the scathing messages, Watson has already received several offers from other coffee shops, and he hopes to put together a Bitter Barista coffee-table book.","Matt Watson, 30, set up blog two weeks ago to rant about customers .

Christopher Davies, 35, was given a 12-week suspended jail sentence, barred from ever keeping animals and ordered to pay £1,000 in legal costs.

The thug was also seen delivering upper cuts to the terrified animal with his mobile phone as he sat on a park bench in Chelmsford, Essex. Max  was removed from the brute's home the next day in a bid to protect it from further unprovoked attacks. Davies was questioned by a welfare officer before becoming the first person in the city to be pursued by Chelmsford City Council through the Animal Welfare Act 2006.

Anne Brewer, chairman of the bench, told Davies: 'This attack was brutal, in a public place where children were present.' Kate Armstrong, defending, had told the court Davies knew it was not the way to treat a dog and that he had expressed remorse for his actions. Speaking after the sentencing on June 4, council public health and protection services manager Paul Brookes, said: 'The cameras captured the incident and it was quite clear the dog was being beaten for no apparent reason. 'The footage was shown to a vet who agreed that the animal would have suffered, and an officer from animal welfare also had the view that further action needed to be taken as it constituted an unprovoked attack.' Ian Grundy, Chelmsford City Council's cabinet member for safer communities, added: 'This prosecution sends a clear message that abuse of animals will not be tolerated in Chelmsford.' Davies has been stripped of his ownership of Max which is now in kennels awaiting a new home.","Christopher Davies will never be allowed to own dogs again .

A woman claims that hypnosis revealed she shot dead a farmer who she believes raped her - nearly 40 years ago. Janet Holt, 64, has been questioned by police over her claim that she had buried the memories of the killing until she went for therapy decades later. Her business partner Fred Handford, then 56, vanished in 1976. Despite a huge police search he was never found. Janet Holt claims hypnosis revealed that she shot and killed farmer Fred Handford after he raped her in 1976 . The body of Fred Handford, pictured on Ball Beard Farm in 1968, has never been found . For more than 30 years Miss Holt, who worked with him at Ball Beard farm in Buxton, Derbyshire, had no clue what happened to him. But she had repeated unexplained nightmares about Mr Handford and underwent therapy to see if there was something locked deep in her mind. Miss Holt said the recollection was terrifyingly clear - she shot Fred after he twice raped her, then put his body in a wheelbarrow and buried him on their farm. Police arrested and interviewed her in 2011 after she went to officers and told them where she believed she buried the body. But after extensive searches of the 50-acre farm, he was never found and she was released. The case remains open. Miss Holt said: 'There are no words that I can use to describe how I felt when I realised what I had done. 'Then suddenly there it was, stored in my own memory for 34 years. I killed Fred Handford. I was stunned. 'I couldn't believe I'd killed someone, I never would have thought I was capable of such a thing. 'I knew exactly what I had to do so I handed myself in to the police. I believe he is there and that the police just haven't found him. 'Obviously I don't want to go to prison but justice would have to take its course. I want Fred's remains found.' Miss Holt was 26 at the time of Mr Handford's disappearance. She had worked on the farm since she was 14 and says he was like a father to her. Janet Holt, left, and Fred Handford, right, were business partners on Ball Beard Farm in Buxton, Derbyshire, before his 1976 disappearance . Miss Holt believes she put Mr Handford's dead body in a wheelbarrow and buried him on Ball Beard Farm in Buxton, Derbyshire . One morning, she woke up to find that he was missing and she had no memory of the past four days. She said: 'I knew something was wrong when I saw my muddy wellington boots by my bed, as I would never have dragged all that mud through the house. 'I felt delirious and when I found out Fred was missing I was beside myself wondering where he had gone. 'But never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd have hurt him. I took my mother to the farm with me. Fred was nowhere to be seen. 'I called his name and looked for him in the farmhouse. 'It was unlike Fred to leave the farm apart from when he visited his sister. So, I called her and she said he wasn't there. 'My mother and I waited a few hours for Fred to return but after a while we became worried and we called the police.' Fred Handford was like a father to Janet Holt, she said . Janet Holt had worked on the farm for 12 years before Mr Handford vanished in 1976 . Mr Handford was officially declared missing. Miss Holt was interviewed by police but released without charge. She said: 'Those four blank days always bothered me but I never thought I had anything to do with Fred's disappearance. 'The nightmares I had were extremely vivid and utterly terrifying. It got to the point where they were causing me to be depressed. 'I never saw Fred in the dreams but I often thought of him and wondered about what had happened to him.' Miss Holt then heard of Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing, a form of psychotherapy called that is used to bring back memories and eliminate trauma. A 1976 report on the story in the Manchester Evening News detailed the hunt for Mr Handford, described as 5ft 10in, slim, with a scar on the right temple. Neighbouring farmers told the paper that he never went anywhere without his horse and cart, dog and hat, which had been left behind . Another newspaper report described how rescuers searched the nearby moorland for Mr Handford . She said: 'I went to a psychologist's office. She talked me through the therapy, which involved me trying to relive the lost four days of my life and moving my eyes from side to side to stimulate the memories.' Miss Holt said remembered everything after four hours of intense therapy. She said: 'I remembered that four days before his disappearance, Fred had raped me twice. I had clear visions of the attack, and how I was preparing to leave the farm for good. 'For days I ignored Fred and never went back to the farm. I didn't want to see him. 'But one afternoon after the attack I walked to the nearby stables to feed my ponies and found a note pinned to the door. Janet Holt has written The Stranger In My Life about her experiences . 'It read, ""I'm sorry. Please look after the animals"". 'I remembered clutching the note and panicking, thinking that Fred may have killed himself because of the guilt of raping me. 'That night I was in such a state of upset and panic. I didn't know what to do with myself. 'The next morning I woke up and went to the farmhouse. 'When I got there Fred was standing in the kitchen and laughing, saying, ""I knew that note would get you here"". 'He told me to sit down at the kitchen table, and he turned his back to me to put the kettle on. I was petrified thinking he was going to rape me again. 'Out of the corner of my eye I saw Fred's shotgun propped up against the wall. 'Fred was always telling me not to touch the gun because it was loaded. 'Without thinking I grabbed hold of it. 'I took aim at Fred whilst he still had his back to me and I shot him once in the back. 'It was the oddest feeling. I had mourned for my friend for more than 30 years without knowing that actually he was a rapist and I was a killer. 'I wished I had remembered at the time and confessed and got on with my life. 'The nightmares and uncertainty have been horrendous.' Miss Holt has written a book - The Stranger In My Life - about her experiences.

Smiling: But Ed and David Miliband are still at odds with claims that friends of Ed have been 'banned' from David's farewell party . The feud between the Miliband brothers was reignited last night over claims that friends of Labour leader Ed have been ‘banned’ from a farewell bash as David starts a new life in America. Invitations to a champagne party in London’s West End have been sent to all Labour MPs who voted for David when he was narrowly beaten by Ed in the party leadership contest in 2010. But MPs who backed the younger sibling claim they have been left off the list. The snub illustrates the continuing hostility between the rival factions of Blairite David and his Brownite brother. One ally of Ed said: ‘It is a typical act of pettiness by David. It shows exactly why he lost the Labour leadership to Ed – he has no idea how to treat his colleagues with respect.’ A Labour MP who voted for Ed added: ‘Judging by those who have got invites and those who haven’t, they have gone down a list of those who voted for David and invited them and scrubbed the rest of us off. To exclude people because they did not vote for you three years ago is stupid. ‘It is time to bury the hatchet, but David can never bring himself to do it.’ Embarrassingly for Ed, most Labour MPs have been invited, since the majority supported his brother in 2010. Ed’s victory depended on his overwhelming support from union barons. Few union officials have been invited to the bash. The party is being organised by three leading Blairite figures: former Home Secretary Alan Johnson, who backed David’s leadership campaign, Labour frontbencher and former  television presenter Gloria De Piero and ex-Labour General Secretary Siobhan McDonagh. The event is being held in an upmarket bar in London’s Oxford Circus on July 9. It will feature speeches highlighting David Miliband’s record as Tony Blair’s head of policy and later, Foreign Secretary. One of the party organisers said they did not know if Ed Miliband had been invited. The Labour leader’s office said he had been – and would attend. Relations between the two brothers have not recovered from the acrimonious race to succeed Gordon Brown. David’s wife, musician Louise, is said to have remained ‘frosty’ towards Ed’s wife, Justine, ever since. The row is said to have caused so much friction that they have not attended each other’s children’s birthday parties. In the wake of his failed bid,  David’s allies urged him to stay on in politics and plot his revenge in the hope that Ed would make a mess of the job and be forced to step down. Acrimonious: David's wife Louise, left, is said to have remained 'frosty' towards Ed's wife Justine, right . But, despite low personal ratings, there is little appetite among Labour MPs to change the party leader. And David, whose image never recovered from posing with a banana in one hand, became a peripheral figure in Parliament. Earlier this year, he abandoned all hope of replacing his brother and decided to quit the Commons and move to America as head of the New York-based International Rescue Committee. His £300,000-a-year salary is nearly five times higher than his wage as a Labour MP. He will also get a plush office near New York’s Grand Central Station, complimentary private health care, a tax-free pension and a host of other perks. David will be responsible for humanitarian projects with 12,000 staff and an annual budget of £240 million. The IRC’s money comes mainly from public grants – including £110 million of British aid over the past ten years.","Invitations sent to all Labour MPs who backed David in 2010 contest .

Guilty: Stephen Smith was found guilty of attacking Ms Green by a jury at Gloucester crown court and told by the judge a prison sentence was 'inevitable' A woman was viciously attacked in her own home because she had hacked into another woman's Facebook account. Donna Green was sending messages on the other woman's Facebook page when Stephen Smith arrived at her home to stop her. Mr Smith, 44, of Matson, Gloucester, beat up Ms Green, punching her repeatedly, and tried to rob her of her computer, the jury was told, leaving her battered and covered in blood. Mr Smith, a friend of the other . woman, denied attempted robbery, assaulting Ms Green causing her actual . bodily harm and damaging her front door handle and a glass photo frame. But the jury convicted him of all three charges last week. Judge Michael Harington warned . him that a prison sentence seemed 'inevitable' when he is sentenced. Ms Green told the court she was at . home in Coney Hill, Gloucester, on the evening of February 1 and had . logged into the Facebook account of a woman she claimed was using drugs . and abusing her children. She admitted she had obtained the other woman's Facebook password and was using her account as if she was her. ‘She was an old school friend but she had some of her children in care because she had hit them,' said Ms Green alleged. ‘She was not very nice to her kids . so I was keeping an eye on her. She was also using a drug called M-Cat. I had threatened her with social services because her kids were at . risk,’ she said in court. ‘But while I was on her account I started receiving messages which were not very nice,’ she said. Ms Green said she received about . 20 messages, mostly from the same person, but there were a few which . were from Stephen Smith which said 'I am watching you,' she said. ‘He threatened to deal with me if I went on her account again.' A few minutes later, she said, she . logged off and was getting ready to go out to her father's 60th . birthday party when she realised Mr Smith was in her home. ‘He came running at me and hitting . me, full strength,’ she said. ‘He pushed me onto a glass topped table . in my living room and started punching me. Victim: Donna Green hacked into a woman's facebook account and was then attacked in her own home by Stephen Smithn . ‘As he hit me he was telling me to . delete the woman's profile. I managed to run to my bedroom and I tried . to lock myself in but he overpowered me. He got me on the floor and laid . into me. He kept punching and punching and punching. ‘I told him I couldn't breathe . because he had all his bodyweight on me. I thought I was going to die. He said 'I don't want you to f***ing breathe.' ‘I tried to get away and run to . the front door but he started stamping all over my head and punching me. He must have punched me 25 times. ‘My dog was so scared by what was happening that he weed all over the floor.’ Ms Green said Smith picked up a glass framed photo and hit her with it. ‘He kept telling me to delete the . Facebook profile but then he said he would do it himself and he picked . up my PC tower. I screamed at him to give it back and he dropped it as . he got into his van and sped away.’ The jury saw pictures of her blood . covered face and injured eyes. In testimony Ms Green said an optician . had told her she would have lasting damage to her right eye, ‘Ever since . the incident I have suffered with headaches and I have double vision’, . she added. Under cross-examination Ms Green . admitted she had changed the woman's Facebook password and was making . comments which others would believe came from the woman. ‘Do you think that was an acceptable way to carry on?’ Sarah Jenkins, defending, asked. ‘No, I don't,’ replied Ms Green. But she said she had done it to gather information about the other woman which she could present to social services. Ms Jenkins suggested that Ms Green . also intended to make trouble for Mr Smith with his girlfriend by . claiming he was having a relationship with the other woman. She denied . that.

Maternity units are forced to shut their doors temporarily across England more than 1,000 times a year, it has been revealed. In one instance, expectant mothers were told to travel up to 65 miles to give birth because their preferred hospital had closed its doors. And Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust stopped accepting new patients 353 times alone in 2011 and 2012. Closure: NHS maternity wards have been forced to close their doors more than 1,000 times a year because of soaring demand . The huge number of maternity unit closures has been put down to the high birth rate which currently stands at 688,000 a year - the highest level in more than 40 years. The birth rate has soared by as much as 50 per cent in some areas over the last 10 years, and across England as a whole it has gone up by 22 per cent. The Royal College of Midwives called earlier this year for an extra 5,000 midwives to cope with the pressure. Campaign groups said that being forced to travel to a neighbouring hospital - even if it is just a few miles away - can be highly stressful for mothers in labour. NHS trusts typically close maternity units for only a few hours at a time, although in some instances closures have lasted for up to three days, the Sunday Telegraph reported. On three occasions, women who were supposed to give birth at East Surrey Hospital, Redhill, were instead told they would have to go to Portsmouth, 65 miles away, or deliver their child at home. Closures: Leeds General Infirmary which, along with a neighbouring hospital, was forced to close its maternity unit 353 times over a two year period . Shut: St James' Hospital, Leeds, which along with the other hospital in the city was shut 353 times. When one closed its doors, maternity patients were routinely sent to the other . Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act to the Sunday Telegraph revealed 66 NHS Trusts closed their doors a total of 1,795 times in 2011 and 2012.

A number of Trusts did not respond to the request - raising the spectre that the total number of maternity unit closures could be far higher, and comfortably in excess of 1,000 a year. Belinda Phipps, chief executive of the National Childbirth Trust, told the newspaper: 'It is disconcerting to hear that so many hospitals are unable to cope safely with the number of women arriving at their doors. 'For many birthing woman, being told your chosen place of birth is not available is stressful and can have worrying implications, such as travelling in labour. 'It is important that commissioners monitor these suspensions and look at ways to prevent them in order to ensure that women are as safe and stress free as possible.' A lack of capacity and a shortage of suitably-qualified staff were the main reasons given for closing maternity units. A spokesman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust confirmed that they closed their doors 353 times in 2011 and 2012 at St James' Hospital, Leeds, and Leeds General Infirmary. When one unit is at full capacity mothers-to-be are often sent to the other. However, the Trust was forced to shut both to incoming patients on four occasions over the two-year period. A spokesperson from Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'Inevitably at times demand can be unpredictable and if one location gets too busy we have the ability to divert mums-to-be to our neighbouring facility to ensure safe and effective care with the minimum of disruption.' Closure: East Surrey Hospital, in Redhill, sent patients to the maternity unit in Portsmouth which is 66 miles away . University Hospitals Leicester NHS Trust were forced to shut their doors 142 times in 2011 and 122 times in 2012, on the back of soaring demand. They have seen the local birth rate soar from 8,800 in 2002-03 to 10,800 in 2012-13. The NHS Trust operate three maternity units, and when one closes its doors they simply send patients to another. Judith Foxon, matron in women’s services at Leicester’s Hospitals, said: 'Unfortunately, when demand is exceptionally high we have to divert women to other local maternity units.' Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, who ran maternity units at three hospitals, shut their doors 166 times in total in 2011. However, they have not had to shut their doors at all since September 2011 when all childbirth services were moved to Tunbridge Wells. A spokesman said: 'The Trust has had no maternity ward closures in the last 23 months and as such this is not a true or accurate reflection of services provided recently or at any point in the last two years.' Bill Kilvington, Associate Director for Women’s and Children’s Health, Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, said: 'We deeply regret any time the maternity unit has to refer patients elsewhere. 'We have invested in midwives and a new birthing unit so we can now offer homely en-suite rooms, each with its own birth pool and double bed for mums expecting an uncomplicated birth; a home birth with experienced midwives who can come out to support the birth and a Delivery Suite with comfortable rooms, and a birth pool if you need to be under the supervision of a doctor during labour.' An NHS spokesman said: 'The NHS now has 800 more midwives than it did in 2010, and there are a record 5,000 midwives in training who will qualify over the next three years. 'We realise there has been a long history of a shortage of midwives but this is a situation that NHS England is keen to address. 'As a workforce issue, it is for the GP led Clinical Commissioning Groups to look at their provision and to commission the services locally to ensure adequate cover. 'Most women already have a choice and one-to-one maternity care, and we are working closely with the Royal College of Midwives to ensure that personalised, one-to-one maternity care is available for every woman across the country.'","Mothers-to-be turned away by East Surrey Hospital, Redhill, and sent 65 miles to Portsmouth .

Five passengers from the plane which made an emergency landing in Scotland yesterday following the discovery of a threatening note are now claiming asylum in the UK. The flight from Egypt to the United States was diverted to Prestwick Airport in Ayrshire yesterday after the note, which read 'I'll set this plane on fire', was found in a toilet. The plane was searched by police officers overnight and no suspicious items were found. It was allowed to continue its journey to New York this morning. Ordeal: It took six hours to get all 326 people on board the EgyptAir flight off the plane at Prestwick Airport. It is unknown which of passengers have claimed asylum . The Boeing 777 was escorted to the airport by Typhoon fighter jets . A spokesman for Police Scotland said five of the plane's passengers had sought asylum in Britain. Their identities are not known and they are now being dealt with by the UK Border Agency. The EgyptAir Boeing 777 was escorted to Prestwick by Typhoons from RAF Leuchars during its flight from Cairo to JFK Airport in New York. It landed at about 2.30pm yesterday and was met by a dozen police vehicles. It took six hours before all 326 people on board were removed from the plane to be interviewed by officers. Passenger Nada Tawfik, a producer for BBC New York, said she found a note in a toilet apparently threatening to start a fire. She told the BBC News Channel: 'When I went in to change my daughter about three hours into the flight, I found a note by the sink saying ""I set this plane on fire"" with the seat number 46D written on it. 'So I immediately went to the crew and told them about it. 'It was on a hand napkin written in pencil and the pencil was actually still there so I told the crew to make sure to keep it so they can get any fingerprints off of it.

Fears: The flight was escorted by fighter jets from RAF Leuchars . On board: BBC New York producer Nada Tawfik found the note in the cabin toilets scribbled on a napkin . 'It almost looked like a child's handwriting or someone who has very sloppy handwriting, but it was very alarming especially these days when everyone is so concerned about safety on flights. 'I said to one of the stewardesses ""I don't know if this is a prank"", they said ""no, it can't be a prank"". 'Either someone has a very bad sense of humour or, you know, it's very scary.' The plane was searched by officers once all passengers had disembarked. Prestwick is a designated airport for emergencies and remained open while the EgyptAir plane sat on a runway. Chief executive Iain Cochrane said: 'We carefully plan and train for this kind of eventuality and I am relieved it ended safely and without incident. 'It was a complex and constantly evolving matter and I want to thank my staff for their unswerving professionalism and commitment during the 13 hours the aircraft was here, and praise the excellent manner in which all agencies involved worked together to resolve the matter. 'I must also thank the airline and their crew for their rapid deployment of resources and their contribution to resolving the issue.

After the coldest Easter Sunday on record, you’d hope for a brief respite from the Arctic weather. But it seems spring is shaping up to be colder than winter was, with no sign of temperatures warming up. The bank holiday weekend was yesterday confirmed as the coldest Easter since records began in 1960, with temperatures dipping well below freezing.

March 26 was 2.5C (36.5), colder than December at 3.8C (38.8F), January . at 3.3C (37.9F), and February at 2.8C (37F). The average March temperature in the Central Region used by forecasters – the area bordered by London, Manchester and Bristol – is currently 3.2C (37.8F) If this figure stays the same it will be the coldest March since 1962. Greg Dewhurst, from the Met Office, said: ‘It looks like it could be the coldest temperature experienced over the Easter period. ‘It is likely to be the coldest March since 1962. ‘At the moment there is no sign  of the weather getting warmer as by the end of the week temperatures still remain low with a maximum of about 8C (46.4F) in some places by Friday.’ The chill is in stark contrast to the same time last year when Britain enjoyed a mini heatwave, with temperatures in March  soaring to 21C (69.8F). Bookmaker Ladbrokes paid out more than £250,000 to gamblers who correctly predicted a white Easter after snow fell in the Hackney and Croydon areas of London on Saturday. Forecasters also predicted the bitterly cold weather would continue into today. They advised people to wrap up warm as a 15mph south-easterly wind is expected to make temperatures feel as low as -2C (28.4F) in some places. Sleet and snow showers are predicted in southern parts of the UK, most likely in Kent and East Anglia, but the rest of the country is set to be dry with sunny spells, with maximum temperatures of 7C (44.6F). Tonight temperatures could dip to as low as -10C (14F) in Scotland, and as low as -2C (28.4F) elsewhere in the UK. It is predicted the below-average temperatures will remain until mid-April. David Cameron performed a ewe turn by wading in to a swamp to rescue a stranded sheep after a day helping a neighbour with lambing in his rural Oxfordshire constituency, he told visitors to Number 10. 'Well, I helped my neighbour with his lambing one weekend and that gave me more pleasure than anything I've done for a long time,' he said after being asked what he would do after politics. 'He lost one of his ewes and so we were bottle-feeding some of his lambs and then one of his sheep got stuck in a swamp,' he told one of the winners of the Mum of the Year awards. The sheep had followed her two lambs in to try to save them, but they drowned. Mr Cameron and his two armed guards waded in waist-deep to push the ewe to safety. The ewe has been renamed Swampy and is said to be fully recovered. Farmer Julian Tustian told the Daily Telegraph: 'He was brilliant, pulling, pushing and shoving. He was covered in mud, he looked a mess. He didn't have to do it.'

Quit: Paul Tucker announced he is stepping down as Bank of England Deputy Governor . Bank of England deputy governor Paul Tucker is to step down after missing out on the top job. He had been tipped to become the governor when Sir Mervyn King retired, but became caught up in the scandal of banks fixing lending rates. Today it was announced Mr Tucker will leave the bank after spending a few months supporting new governor, Canadian Mark Carney. /Mr Tucker said he planned to spend time in academia in the United States following his departure. He has faced speculation over his role at the Bank after he lost out to Mr Carney in the race to take over from Sir Mervyn. He was a key figure involved . in banking reform and overhauling UK . financial regulation. But he was badly damaged by the interbank rate-rigging scandal when former Barclays boss Bob . Diamond claimed Mr Tucker had told the bank to lower its Libor . submissions. Mr Tucker denied leaning on Barclays, but the episode is widely thought to have cost him the top job at the Bank. Announcing his decision to quit, Mr Tucker said: ‘It has been an extraordinary honour to serve at the Bank of England over the past 30 years. ‘I am very proud that, through the Bank and the wider central banking community, I have been able to make a contribution to monetary and financial stability. I will continue to do so in the coming months.’ In an exchange of letters over his decision to leave, Chancellor George Osborne praised Mr Tucker for the ‘tremendous contribution’ he has made to UK monetary and financial policy. He added Mr Tucker had helped shape changes being made to the financial system across the world in the wake of the banking crisis. He wrote: ‘Your intellectual capacity and independence have proved invaluable in building solutions to the greatest financial challenges we have faced in generations.’ Mr Tucker was appointed deputy governor for financial stability in 2009 and he is a member of the recently created watchdog, the Financial Policy Committee, as well as on the board of the Prudential Regulation Authority. Sir Mervyn King is standing down as Bank Governor next month, but deputy Mr Tucker was over-looked . Mr Tucker's departure will see him stand down early from his five year term, which is due to end in February 2014, although his exact leaving date is yet to be announced. His decision to step down will leave Mr Carney with the task of hiring two new deputy governors, as Charlie Bean is also due to leave at the end of June next year. Mr Bean, who is deputy governor for monetary policy, had been due to stand down on the same day as Sir Mervyn, but agreed to remain in post for another year to help Mr Carney. Andrew Bailey - chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority - is the Bank's third deputy governor in charge of prudential policy. Sir Mervyn paid tribute to Mr Tucker's time at the Bank. He said: ‘Paul's contribution to the Bank, to monetary policy, and more generally to public policy, both in the UK and in the world as a whole has been enormous.’ Mr Carney, who has worked with Mr Tucker on the G20's Financial Stability Board (FSB), said: ‘Paul has contributed immeasurably to a series of critical financial reforms, including policies to end Too-Big-to-Fail and to build more resilient derivative and funding markets.’ Mr Tucker, 55, joined the Bank in 1980 soon after graduating from Cambridge University. The Treasury said the process to appoint Mr Tucker's successor had not yet started, but would be set out ‘in due course’. All governor and deputy governor appointments at the Bank are formally made by the Queen, on recommendation of the Prime Minister and Mr Osborne, although Mr Carney is expected to be closely involved in the process.","Over-looked to replace Sir Mervyn King who stands down next month .

EU judges have ruled Swiss chocolate-makers Lindt & Spruengli cannot trademark its world famous golden rabbit. The firm, which has been producing the treats since 1952 and claims to sell around 60 million a year, had hoped to stop Austrian rival Hauswirth from producing an almost identical-looking product. But the Luxembourg-based European Union Court of Justice (ECJ) upheld the decision of the EU trademarks agency OHIM, which rejected Lindt's application for a trademark of its sitting bunny shapes wrapped in gold foil with a red ribbon bow tie. Rabbit row: The Lindt chocolate bunny (left) and Austrian firm Hauswirth's rival product . The General Court, the EU's second-highest court had already said in 2010 that the decision of OHIM was correct, leading to Lindt's appeal before the ECJ. 'The Court confirms the reasoning of the General Court which found that Lindt had not proved that distinctive character had been acquired through use across the EU,'  the ECJ said in a statement. Lindt declined to comment on the ruling beyond saying it had not yet reviewed the judgment in full. A spokeswoman said that its bunnies had been protected since 2000 because they carried a Lindt logo. Ruling: The Luxembourg-based European Union Court of Justice said Lindt had 'failed to establish the mark as a marque as an inherent distinctive character' 'We have built the trademark over about 20 years to make it a very strong brand, and this is the reason we want to protect it,' a spokeswoman for Lindt said. The row began in 2004 when Lindt told Hauswirth, which has been producing bunnies for 50 years, that they must switch to using bronze foil wrapping and a green bow. Hauswirth refused but initially lost in court and were ordered to halt selling the bunnies until the matter had been fully resolved. In March, an Austrian court ruled that family-owned rival Hauswirth could no longer produce Easter bunnies that look like those made by Lindt. Hauswirth declined to comment on Thursday's European court ruling.","Swiss firm had hoped to stop Austrian rivals from producing similar product .

Baroness Thatcher smiled as she watched a video of playful puppies in the final hours before her death, it emerged last night. It was thought to be her last sign of contentment and she shared it with her trusted friend and former adviser Lord Powell, who visited her often at the Ritz hotel. The video was of eight biscuit-coloured Dachshund puppies and their mother, belonging to Lady Powell, the Italian wife of the former prime minister’s trusted Downing Street private secretary. Friends: Lord Powell is pictured with Baroness Thatcher in March 2000. He served as her private secretary . Sitting with her at her suite in the Ritz on Sunday night, Powell was the last person to visit her as she neared the end of her life. He took out his iPad to entertain his former boss and on it he showed her a video that his wife had sent him from their home outside Rome, which Lady Thatcher had visited for several years running before she became too unwell. Did Baroness Thatcher face a tougher job as prime minister than David Cameron does today? Lady Powell said her husband had told her she smiled at the antics of the puppies and their mother. She told the Guardian: ‘That was probably her last smile. After seeing her, Charles’s comment was, “I’m afraid that she will not be with us for very long. I think she’s drifting away.”’ She passed away the following morning. Lord Powell was among a small circle of trusted friends who visited Lady . Thatcher to keep her entertained and stimulated.

We must go back.”’ Lady Thatcher visited the Powells' sprawling villa near Rome every summer for several years before she became too ill last year. Baroness Thatcher's died on Monday inside her Ritz suite, where she spent the final months of her life. Surrounded by the people who cared for her, the Iron Lady died 'peacefully' here following a stroke at 11.28am on Monday, as she sat up and quietly read. Lady Thatcher, who had suffered a series of mini-strokes over the past decade, recognised the symptoms as she fell ill in the luxurious room, 'but this was the one that killed her', a friend said. The suite, which would cost up to £3,660 a night, boasts 24 carat gold leaf and antique Louis XVI furnishings, and is the size of a small flat. Room: Lady Thatcher had been staying in this suite at the Ritz in Central London, where she had been living since Christmas as she recovered from an operation . It is still unclear what Lady Thatcher was reading when she died, but insiders say it could have been that morning's newspapers.

He was testifying at the court-martial of Staff Sergeant Frank Wuterich at Camp Pendleton in California about when the group gunned down six people, including a man in a wheelchair. On trial: Marine Staff Sergeant Frank Wuterich arrives at the court in Camp Pendleton, California, with his lawyer Neal Puckett. He faces nine counts of manslaughter and other charges .

Charged: Wuterich is the last defendant in one of the biggest criminal cases against U.S. troops from the Iraq war . Wuterich, the squad leader, faces nine . counts of manslaughter and other charges stemming from Marine actions . that day that killed 24 Iraqis in the town of Haditha in 2005. The Marines stormed two homes for 45 . minutes, killing unarmed men, women and children. They found no weapons . or insurgents, squad members testified. Salinas testified that he was the . first Marine to enter the house after the roadside bomb exploded. He . said he shot a figure he saw near the stairs and later learned he had . killed an elderly woman. He said he saw the man in a wheelchair after he went back to the home later. Four other unarmed civilians were killed there. Asked by a defence attorney if he . would have done anything differently that day, Salinas said: ‘I would . have just utilised my air to just level the house’. Wuterich's lawyers have said their client believed insurgents were in the home after the explosion. Military prosecutors have implicated . him in 19 of the 24 Iraqi deaths. The Marine from Connecticut is the . last defendant in one of the biggest criminal cases against U.S. troops . from the war. One squad member was acquitted. Six . others had their cases dropped. Salinas was never formally charged. He . was one of two squad members who testified on Thursday.

Both raised questions about testimony . given on Wednesday by another fellow Marine who said Wuterich had called . for bloodshed of Iraqis if his squad ever was hit by a roadside bomb. The deadly attack known as the Haditha massacre occurred on November 19, 2005, led to the deaths of 24 Iraqis in total. Seven of them were children. The killings are considered among the Iraq war's defining moments, further tainting the U.S.’s reputation when it was already at a low point after the release of photos of prisoner abuse by U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison. Sgt Frank Wuterich is the last of the eight Marines initially accused of murder or failure to investigate the killings to face trial. Six others had their charges either dropped or dismissed, and one was acquitted. A full investigation didn't begin until a Time magazine reporter inquired about the deaths in January 2006, two months after the incident. The story behind the killings was retold in Nick Broomfield's 2007 film Battle for Haditha. Salinas said he did not recall this - and former Lance Corporal Trent Graviss said he never heard it. Salinas and Graviss also said they did . not hear or recall hearing Wuterich ask them to lie about what happened . that day, as Sergeant Sanick Dela Cruz testified on Wednesday. Salinas and Graviss told the . all-Marine jury that they did not believe Dela Cruz to be a truthful . person, and that they considered Wuterich to be a good Marine. The issue at the court martial is . whether Wuterich reacted appropriately as a Marine squad leader in . protecting his troops in the midst of a chaotic war. Or if he went on a vengeful rampage, . disregarding combat rules and leading his men to shoot and blast . indiscriminately at Iraqi civilians. Prosecutors in their opening statement . painted a picture of a young Marine with no prior combat experience . losing control after seeing his friend's body blown apart. Prosecutor Major Nicholas Gannon said . the evidence will show Wuterich ‘made a series of fatal assumptions and . he lost control of himself’. Wuterich has said he regretted the loss of civilian lives but believed he was operating within military combat rules. The squad was returning from a supply run at a combat outpost when one of the four humvees in their convoy hit a roadside bomb, killing Lance Cpl Miguel Terrazas and wounding two others. Corporal Steven Tatum said he rushed to help someone trapped under the humvee when he heard small arms fire hit the vehicle in front. Wuterich and another Marine ran toward the nearest home. Tatum testified that when he caught up to Wuterich, the sergeant told him to 'treat the house as hostile'. Tatum said he understood that to mean there were armed individuals inside. Blast: The moment the roadside bomb exploded as depicted in the 2007 Nick Broomfield film Battle For Haditha . Explosion: Another dramatic image from the film. Some observers believe the jury of combat Marines will be better equipped for the case over a civilian one to judge an appropriate reaction in the chaos of war . He believed he did not need to . identify his target to attack. The Marines tossed grenades in rooms and . fired off rounds. One man was killed near the kitchen. Others were killed in a back room, . where Tatum fired alongside Wuterich but said he was unable to see what . he was shooting at because of the darkness and flying debris after a . grenade exploded. The Marines left when someone yelled . that they had seen a person running out of the home. They ran to a . neighbouring house, tossing grenades in rooms and shooting off rounds. Tatum saw the body of an Iraqi man . near the kitchen when he went in after his fellow men. While checking a . room, he said he heard people in a nearby room moving then Wuterich . firing his M-16.

Though Koch meticulously planned every detail of his burial before dying in February, his gravestone was marked with the wrong birth year, as first reported by NBC New York. The 5-foot tall tombstone lists Koch's birth date as December 12, 1942 instead of 1924--shaving a full 18 years off the departed and beloved New Yorker's life. Typo: The birth date on former NYC Mayor Ed Koch's tombstone, seen here without the date, was listed as 'December 12, 1942' instead of 1924. The dates were engraved a few weeks ago . Oops: His birth year is wrong, shaving 18 years off his age when he died earlier the year . The flub is particularly embarrassing considering his 'new' birth date would have made Koch a child in World War II, and the same headstone says he served in the armed forces during that time. Koch, who served three terms as mayor from 1978 to 1989, died of congestive heart failure on Feb. 1 at age 88. Three days later, Koch was buried in Trinity Church cemetery in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. 'I don't want to leave Manhattan, even when I'm gone,' Koch said when he revealed he bought the plot in 2008, according to NBC. Koch's former chief of staff Diane Coffey said at his funeral he began preparing for his death before even finishing his time as mayor in the 1980s. Koch pre-ordered his tombstone, which is 6-feet wide, but the birth date wasn't engraved until a few weeks ago. New Yorker: Former New York Mayor Ed Koch chose to be buried in Trinity Church cemetery in Washington Heights because he didn't want to leave Manhattan even after death . A manager with Trinity church called Koch's friends and family when he noticed the mistake, according to the New York Post. One of the former mayor's confidants, George Arzt, told the Post the mistake 'took [his] breath away'. 'Do you believe it?' Arzt imitated Koch to the Post. 'Correct the record!' 'We're correcting the record, Ed,' Arzt added. Tommy Flynn of Flynn Funeral and Cremation Memorial Services, which hired the stone cutter, said he felt 'terrible' because the 'inadvertent error'. 'I have to make it right. I will correct it,' Flynn told NBC. Funeral: New York Mayor Ed Koch died of congestive heart failure in February at age 88. He was beloved by many New Yorkers, serving three terms as mayor in the 1980s . Coffery said she was 'appalled' by the mistake, but that Koch might have thought it was amusing. 'As Ed Koch used to say, ""It's always important to correct the record,""' she said. On the tombstone, Koch included the words of journalist Daniel Pearl, who was killed by Islamic terrorists: 'My father is Jewish; my mother is Jewish; I am Jewish.' The tombstone also has an epithet that Koch wrote himself: . 'He was fiercely proud of his Jewish faith. He fiercely defended the City of New York, and he fiercely loved its people. Above all, he loved his country, the United States of America, in whose armed forces he served in World War II.'","Ed Koch's gravestone lists his birth year as 1942 instead of 1924, making him 18 years younger .

Accusations: It has been claimed that Peter and Louise Mensch were long embroiled in an adulterous affair before they got married . For two decades, Louise Mensch –née Bagshawe – has cast a shadow over Melissa Meyer. Yet until recently, Melissa could at least take heart that the new wife of her ex-husband Peter Mensch lived far from her home in New York’s Greenwich Village. But now, after Louise resigned her Tory MP’s seat to live with rock band manager Peter in the States, the two blondes are just four miles apart. The likelihood of them peacefully coexisting seems especially remote after the startling claim by the  family of Melissa, known as Missy, that Peter and Louise were long embroiled in an adulterous affair. In August, Louise, 41, dramatically announced she was resigning her seat in Corby, Northamptonshire. The chick-lit author’s career as an MP was marked by controversy. Yet nothing was more surprising than her wedding in June 2011 to Peter, whose bands include Metallica. It followed his divorce from Melissa in December 2010. Now Melissa’s family have voiced suspicions the couple had a 20-year affair when they were both married – Peter to Melissa, and Louise to US businessman Anthony LoCicero. Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, Melissa’s sister-in-law Laura Meyer said the family believe the affair began when Louise, then an undergraduate, invited Peter to the Oxford Union to talk about the music industry. ‘I feel it is important to make public our suspicions Louise was having a relationship with Peter which we believe dates back to when she was 18 or 19 years old,’ said Ms Meyer. ‘When Missy found out in August 2009 they had been involved in an affair, she was devastated.’ Last week, Peter, 59, said that their love blossomed in 2009, after Louise separated from Anthony. Peter was still married to Melissa, but says  Louise told him she had loved him for 20 years. Asked if they had an affair before that, he said: ‘Hmmm .  .  . no.’ They stayed in touch after their first meeting in 1990. Louise has credited Peter with helping her land a job with record label EMI. The same year, Peter married Melissa, his second wife. The couple have 17-year-old twins Eli and Hannah, and a daughter Jona, 16. In 1995, Louise dedicated her novel Career Girls to Peter, thanking him ‘for taking me along for the ride’. In it, Rowena, a ‘blonde’ and . ‘beautiful’ British woman – educated at Louise’s old Oxford college, . Christ Church – has a long affair with a married, older Jewish-American . music tycoon. He eventually dumps his wife for Rowena. The book features . a brash American, ‘Marissa’. Louise married Anthony in 2000. They had three children, but in May 2009 she announced their separation. The Mail on Sunday has established that Louise declared her love for Peter in February 2009 at a Metallica gig. Standing down: In August, Louise, 41, dramatically announced she was resigning her seat in Corby, Northamptonshire . Peter admitted to an affair and requested a divorce. ‘Missy did everything to save the marriage,’ said her brother Fred. The family said she was ‘creeped out’ by the parallels in Career Girls. Melissa kept the family’s £4.4 million townhouse, while Peter and Louise have a mansion on the Upper West Side. Peter refused to discuss the claim of an affair with Louise, saying: ‘I don’t talk about my ex-wife and I don’t talk about Louise. I’m not going to discuss my personal life.’ Melissa signed a gagging order as part of her divorce.","The startling claim has been made by the family of Peter Mensch's ex-wife .

Shin deep in mud and rain water and getting a soaking from a monsoon deluge, it's hard to fathom why these workers could possibly look so happy in their daily toil. But far from being concerned about getting wet, these farmers are delighted that the heavens have opened. For monsoon season signals the start of Nepal's main rice planting season - the source of the country's staple diet and the nation's main source of income. Busy month: Rice farmers take to the fields at the start of monsoon season in Kathmandu, Nepal . Happy in her work: A farmer smiles while eating her lunch after planting rice saplings in the rice paddy field in Khokana, Lalitpur . Getting wet: Nepalese farmers cover themselves from the rain while planting rice saplings in the rice paddy field in Khokana, Lalitpur, but the heavy rain provides perfect conditions to grow rice . Dirty work: A farmer works hard to plant rice saplings in a paddy field on the outskirts of Katmandu, Nepal . The season is the most crucial time for Nepalese farmers to take to the paddy fields and plant rice saplings. Know as the month of Asar, it usually falls during June and July in the country and coincides with the peak of Nepal's rainy season. To the locals, planting the rice that will provide their main source of sustenance for the coming year - they eat it for lunch and dinner - is known as 'ropai', a Nepalese word that literally translates to 'cultivation' in English. And the highlight of the busy month is undoubtedly a special festival, known as Asar 15, which this year falls on June 29. Celebration: The farmers celebrate the cultivation season with a special festival known as Asar 15, which takes place at the end of the month . Important work: A farmer prepares the ground for rice saplings to be planted. Rice planting is big business in Nepal - the cereal is the main source of sustenance for many . Work cut out: A group of women are pictured working Nepal's vast paddy fields. More than seventy percent of Nepalese population depends upon paddy agriculture . Farmers, residents and tourists play in the mud, eat beaten rice, drink and enjoy traditional music as they hope that their annual celebration of ropai jatra - or the rice planting festival - will yield a healthy harvest come October. Part of the celebration sees the farmers join in singing a traditional tune known as the asare song. Rice production really is big business in Nepal. Around half of Nepal's agricultural production centres around rice with almost 3,000 square miles of the country devoted to growing the cereal. Some 75 per cent of the country's working population spends at least six months of the year farming rice and the average person consumes a staggering 78kg of rice every year.

The Justice Department laid out its case in a lawsuit against Lance Armstrong on Tuesday, saying the cyclist violated his contract with the U.S. Postal Service and was 'unjustly enriched' while cheating to win the Tour de France. The government had previously announced it would join the whistle-blower lawsuit brought by former Armstrong teammate Floyd Landis. Tuesday was the deadline to file its formal complaint. The Postal Service paid about $40 million to be the title sponsor of Armstrong's teams for six of his seven Tour de France victories. The filing in U.S. district court in Washington, D.C., says the USPS paid Armstrong $17 million form 1998-2004. The lawsuit also names former team Armstrong team director Johan Bruyneel and team management company Tailwind Sports as defendants. Lawsuit: The Justice Department laid out its case in a lawsuit against Lance Armstrong, saying the cyclist violated his contract with the U.S. Postal Service and was 'unjustly enriched' while cheating to win the Tour de France . The financial costs for Armstrong and Bruyneel could be high. The government said it would seek triple damages assessed by the jury. 'Defendants were unjustly enriched to the extent of the payments and other benefits they received from the USPS, either directly or indirectly,' the complaint said. Armstrong, who in January admitted using performance-enhancing drugs after years of denials, has argued that the Postal Service's endorsement of his team earned the government agency far more than it paid him. Armstrong attorney Elliot Peters called the government's complaint 'opportunistic, and insincere.' 'The U.S. Postal Service benefited tremendously from its sponsorship of the cycling team. Its own studies repeatedly and conclusively prove this. The USPS was never the victim of fraud. Lance Armstrong rode his heart out for the USPS team, and gave the brand tremendous exposure during the sponsorship years,' Peters said. The government must prove not only that the Postal Service was defrauded, but that it was damaged somehow. Sponsorship: Previous studies done for the Postal Service concluded the agency reaped at least $139 million in worldwide brand exposure in four years - $35 million to $40 million for sponsoring the Armstrong team in 2001 . Previous studies done for the Postal Service concluded the agency reaped at least $139 million in worldwide brand exposure in four years - $35 million to $40 million for sponsoring the Armstrong team in 2001; $38 million to $42 million in 2002; $31 million in 2003; and $34.6 million in 2004. The formal complaint against Armstrong appears to rely heavily on evidence and statements supplied by Landis and gathered by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency for its 2012 investigation that exposed a doping program on the USPS team. Armstrong has been banned from sports for life and stripped of his seven Tour de France victories. Bruyneel, who lives in London, also has been charged by USADA with doping violations but is fighting that case in arbitration. The government notes the contract with the Postal Service required riders to follow the rules of cycling, which included bans on performance-enhancing drugs and methods. Confession: Armstrong now admits using steroids, blood boosters and other illegal performance-enhancing drugs and measures to win . Armstrong now admits using steroids, blood boosters and other illegal performance-enhancing drugs and measures to win. By breaking the rules and covering it up, Armstrong and Bruyneel committed fraud against the U.S. government, the complaint said. The complaint said that for years, team officials assured the Postal Service that the team was not doping. Armstrong had been the target of a federal criminal grand jury, but that case was closed without charges in February 2012. Armstrong has previously tried to settle the Landis whistleblower lawsuit, but those talks broke down before the government announced its intention to join the case. Armstrong is also fighting a lawsuit from Dallas-based promotions company SCA to recover about $12 million it paid him in bonuses, and a lawsuit from the London-based Sunday Times, which wants to get back $500,000 it paid him to settle a libel case.","Lawsuit from Department of Justice claims cyclist violated his contract with U.S. Postal Service .

Mental illness: Katharine Welby, pictured with her father, the Archbishop of Canterbury, has revealed how depression drove her to the brink of suicide . The Archbishop of Canterbury’s daughter has revealed how depression drove her to the brink of suicide last year after her boyfriend broke up with her. Katharine Welby, who has previously spoken of her bouts of depression, said: ‘I got to the point where I just couldn’t bear the thought of living any more.’ The 26-year-old also admitted she couldn’t stop crying when the news broke of her father the Most Reverend Justin Welby’s appointment – not because she wasn’t happy for him, but because she was ‘overwhelmed’ as a result of her illness. Miss Welby said she was first diagnosed with depression after her first year reading theology at Manchester University. A combination of not being able to work and feeling miserable led her to the doctors but she did not seek further help. Her depression came back at the end of her degree and then surged at the beginning of last year, with what she called ‘catastrophic’ results. She said: ‘I did not like being me. I hated it. I was exhausted by it. I wanted to be someone else. Or nowhere else.’ When asked if she was suicidal, she said: ‘Not quite. That came in April. My boyfriend broke up with me. That was the final straw. ‘I didn’t have the space I needed in my head to grieve for this relationship. My head was already full of things that were hurting.’ By last summer Miss Welby, whose father was enthroned as Archbishop in March, had dropped down to seven stone. Until then she had kept the depression from her parents. 'My whole life fell apart': The 26-year-old has described breaking-up with her boyfriend as the 'final straw' She added: ‘My whole life fell apart. What was happening reminded me how worthless I was, how no one wanted . me, how much of a burden I was. 'All of these underlying things I had . believed for a long time but ignored. I got to the point where I just . couldn’t bear the thought of  living any more. That got very aggressive . and all-consuming.’ She said that in her worst moments . she would try to harm herself and knew if she was left alone for days at . a time without getting out and seeing people she would be a serious . danger to herself. It was the same feeling of emotional . overload that left the former police officer weeping when the news broke . about her father’s appointment. Miss Welby, who lives in London and now works for the Christian charity Livability, said: ‘I ended up crying and crying. Famous father: The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justine Welby, with his wife Caroline at Lambeth Palace . ‘I was excited for him and for what . he could do for the Church,’ she said, but she was also ‘scared’ by the . impact it would have on her life and that of the whole family. ‘I was overwhelmed. My head is . permanently full at the moment. There isn’t very much leeway. It gets to . a point where it is too full. I cease being able to function.’ Miss Welby recovered from her darkest days by reading the Bible and praying. She was, however, critical about the support of the Church for people suffering from mental illness. She added: ‘Some Christians will say, “You’re not depressed”,’ and blame a lack of faith for depression. Miss Welby said she still had her ‘ups and downs’ but now has a new boyfriend called Mike, an IT consultant.","Katharine Welby, 26, described break-up with boyfriend as the 'final straw'

A 23-month-old girl was beaten to death by her mother's boyfriend who then took to Facebook to construct an alibi for what he had done, a court heard today. Roxie Archer died from a 'devastating' brain injury inflicted by Ben Raftery, 21, just hours after her mother had flown out to New York to celebrate her 21st birthday, the jury were told. Afterwards he allegedly altered a Facebook post to make it look like the girl had banged her head on the floor in McDonalds. The girl's mother, Sophie, was only in the US with her father for a matter of hours before she was told that her child had been seriously injured. The court heard that Raftery dialled 999 in the early hours of March 10 last year to say that Roxie had fallen down the stairs at her home in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester. She died the next day in Tameside Hospital but it emerged that she had also suffered extensive bruising and retinal haemorrhaging. Manchester Crown Court was told that a post-mortem examination concluded the injuries were non-accidental and they would have been inflicted while the defendant was looking after Roxie. Roxie's mother flew to America on March 9 while Raftery, her boyfriend of 16 months, was left to look after the child in their terraced home. The girl was later due to be passed on to her grandmother. Kate Blackwell QC, prosecuting, said: 'The trip was due to last five days. She had only been in New York for a matter of hours when she received news that Roxie was very ill in hospital. In fact she was being kept alive on a life support machine. 'Roxie had been left in the sole care of Ben Raftery. It is the prosecution's case that within 24 hours of being in sole charge the defendant had beaten her to death.' The court heard that Roxie had no visible injuries or bruises by 3.30pm on March 9 after Raftery had taken her to the family GP because she had a cough and cold. But by 5pm he told a relative that Roxie had banged her head walking into a door at the town's McDonald's restaurant. 'Attack': Roxie Archer, 23, died after allegedly being attacked by her mother's boyfriend in this street in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester . The Crown say this was a lie which was 'carefully contrived and extensive in its execution'. He went on to put up a photograph of Roxie on his Facebook page with the caption: 'Aaah my little princess with a bang on the head at McDonald's. Now she is saying naughty door. Loved today spending quality time with my little princess. Going to bath her and put her to bed, missing Sophie loads.' But the day after Roxie's death he was said to have changed the Facebook status to say 'Aaah my little process when she banged her head on the floor at McDonalds and said naughty floor'. Shortly before 12.30am on March 10 he rang emergency services to say Roxie had fallen down the stairs at their home. Paramedics arrived to find her lying on a bed in the upstairs bedroom, the jury was told. 'One of the paramedics thought it strange that she had been carried back up the stairs,' said Miss Blackwell. 'Her breathing rate was slowing, she was very pale and had a blue tinge to her skin. 'She was in a very sick and critical condition.' The defendant said he had left the stair gate open by mistake, the court heard. His behaviour at the hospital, says the prosecution, 'seemed somewhat strange'. Miss Blackwell said: 'He seemed only to be concerned about his own welfare. He was heard to say ""I'm scared, they are going to do me for this"". 'He failed to apologise to what had apparently happened to Roxie in his care.' Raftery moved in with Sophie Archer . within weeks of meeting her in November 2011 and at first appeared to . bond with her daughter, the prosecutor said. 'He taught her to call him daddy,' she said. 'Soon he began to refer to her as 'daddy's little girl'.' But he would also 'engage in cruel . behaviour towards her' such as holding her upside down by her ankle to . 'toughen her up' and picking up one end of a sofa by surprise as she sat . on it. By February 2012 Roxie did not want to play with him, the court heard. On one occasion it was said he stormed . out of the house when she would not say goodbye to him as he left for a . trip to Amsterdam. 'In his absence when asked if she wanted to see him again she said no,' said Miss Blackwell. The prosecutor said that a pathologist, a neuropathologist and an . eye specialist had later all agreed the injuries to the head and body . were non-accidental. Those injuries were considered to be a strong indication of traumatic head injuries, possibly including vigorous shaking, the jury was told. Extensive bruising to the face, head and limbs were also consistent with prodding or nipping having taken place. Miss Blackwell said: 'The pathologist's conclusion is that the only credible explanation for the head and brain injuries is that Roxie had been forcibly and repeatedly punched and also possibly slapped across the head.' Raftery denies murder. The trial is scheduled to last up to two weeks.

Five Guantanamo Bay prisoners accused of helping orchestrate the September 11 terror attack- including self-proclaimed mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed- returned to court Monday as arguments resumed over preparations for a trial that remains distant. It was the first time the five prisoners had been in court since February and they sat calmly through a morning's worth of dense legalistic testimony, with none of the outbursts that characterized previous sessions. The court appearance came the same day that the Obama administration released the list of 48 prisoners they said were too dangers to ever let free. Big day: Khalid Sheik Mohammed appeared in court on Monday alongside four other prisoners who were reportedly involved with the September 11 attacks . Mohammed, the self-proclaimed terrorist mastermind and lead defendant, wore a camouflage jacket and white turban, his bushy gray beard dyed reddish-orange. The camouflage jacket was a point of contention in earlier procedural hearings as it was argued that he wanted to wear the garment in order to drive a point home that he considers himself a soldier in their fight. In the audience, behind panels of glass that allow the government to cut off sound in case classified information is inadvertently uttered, were two retired New York firefighters injured while responding to the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center, as well as relatives of other victims. The spectators were chosen by lottery to view the proceedings at the U.S. base in Cuba. Several said they were eager to see it move along. 'They are obviously guilty, I think they have already admitted it, and the trial should happen as quickly as possible,' said Joe Torrillo, one of the two retired firefighters. Procedural: It was the first time the five prisoners had been in court since February and they sat calmly through a morning's worth of dense legalistic testimony, with none of the outbursts that characterized previous sessions . Mohammed has told the military that he was involved in a long list of terrorist plots, including the killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, and has said in court that he was proud of his role in the September 11 plot. The men have not yet entered pleas and defense lawyers say the men were tortured in CIA custody.In the start of what is scheduled to be five days of hearings on pretrial motions, the defense questioned retired Navy Vice Adm. Bruce MacDonald, the Pentagon legal official who oversaw the military tribunals until his term expired in March. The government has asked for a trial in late 2014, though it's likely to be later. Mohammed and his four co-defendants each face charges that include terrorism and nearly 3,000 counts of murder for their alleged roles planning and aiding the September 11, 2001, attack on the United States. They could get the death penalty if convicted. The came the same day that a list released by the U.S. government Monday identified several dozen Guantanamo Bay prisoners who have been designated as too dangerous to release but who can't be prosecuted. Names to faces: The 166 prisoners who remain detained in Guantanamo Bay have been known for years, but now the government identified which are denoted as ones who will never be released . Reaction: In response to the list of 46 'indefinite detainees', women protested outside the American embassy in Sana'a, Yemen . Those on the list are prisoners who . have been held without charge under the Authorized Use of Military Force . act passed by Congress and signed by President George W. Bush in 2001, . said a spokesman for the Pentagon, Army Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale. The . names of all Guantanamo prisoners have been public for years, but the . administration of President Barack Obama had declined to disclose which . detainees had been designated for indefinite detention in 2010 by an . inter-agency review panel. This will be the first public disclosure of the list, though the identity of many of them was widely known through their lawyers. The government released the list after The Miami Herald sued for the document under the Freedom of Information Act. International attention: Amnesty International protesters gathered in front of the site of the G8 summit in Belfast on Sunday calling for the release of all prisoners being held at the controversial base . Procedural: It was the first time the five prisoners had been in court since February and they sat calmly through a morning's worth of dense legalistic testimony, with none of the outbursts that characterized previous sessions . Most of the 48 on the list are from . Yemen and Afghanistan. The Herald specifies that 26 men are from Yemen, . 12 from Afghanistan, 3 from Saudi Arabia, 2 from Kuwait, 2 from Libya, . and one a piece from Kenya, Morocco and Somalia. Two . are now dead — one by suicide, the other by heart attack, meaning that . there are 46 on the list who are still alive at the controversial base. Of those 46, The Herald reports that .

The Wall Street Journal identified five men as indefitine detainees, though it is not clear what acts of terrorism they are linked to or involved with. Those men are named Mullah Mohammad Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori, Mohammed Nabi, Khairullah Khairkhwa, and Abdul Haq Wasiq. There are a total of 166 prisoners at Guantanamo. The government has said it wants to release or transfer the remaining prisoners to their homelands or other countries pending adequate security safeguards to prevent the men from attacking the U.S. or its allies.","Comes same day as federal officials released list of 48 prisoners the U.S. considered indefinite detainees .

A new mobile application in the works will allow vigilante meter maids to cash-in on parking violations. SpotSquad, currently in beta testing, will give users a portion of the parking fine as a reward for reporting illegally-parked cars, according to FoxNews.com. Developed by a 10-person Canadian tech startup in Winnipeg, the app aims to crowd source parking enforcement. Scroll down for demo video . Target: Users of a forthcoming moblie app SpotSquad can get a cut of the fine when they report illegally-parked cars . The app is simple enough: When users spot a car parked illegally, they snap a picture. The picture is tagged with a GPS location and optical character recognition records the car's license plate number. Users also choose from a drop-down list of parking infractions, from 'time expired' to 'double parked'. Using the car's location, a report is automatically sent to the parking lot's operator or local law enforcement, who dispatch personnel to issue a ticket or have the car towed. The tentative business model has the company taking a percentage of the fine paid by a driver and splitting it with the user who reported the car in the first place. If users submit multiple successful reports, they'll get paid at an increasing rate and will be awarded traditional military ranks from Private to General. Users can also choose to give their cut to charity. Chris Johnson, one of the app's co-founders, told CTVNews.ca that they believe lots of people are open to the concept because of the number of accounts set up already. Spotting: The app's users will first choose from a drop-down list of parking violations and snap a picture, which digitally records the GPS location of a car and its license plate number . 'We're getting the feeling this is the kind of thing everyone [is going to want to have] on their phone but no one admits to,' he said. Report: When users rack-up a lot of successful reports, they'll get an increasingly larger cut of the parking fine, which is first paid to the mobile company . Johnson told FoxNews.com, that the photos and users' reports can't be used in court, so official evidence must be collected by those parking operators and traffic cops who get word of the violation. A pilot program of the app should . begin in Winnipeg by July, but Johnson said he sees an opportunity to . expand the app's reach in America. 'We're open to having conversations anywhere where there's parking that needs to be controlled,' Johnson told CTVNews.ca. A similar, though less self-serving, app is already used in America. Parking . Mobility allows trained volunteers to snap shots of cars illegally . parked in disabled spots. A portion of the fines from those reports are . given to the user's favorite charity. That Texas-based company took years to negotiate agreements with police departments and cities, CTVNews.ca reported. The . Canadian app might cause some legal issues, lawyer Brian Bowman told . CTV Winnipeg. Users wouldn't be bound by the same privacy laws as public . sector workers who document illegally parked cars. 'You are empowering citizens and paying them to arguably act as an agent for you,' Bowman said. It also has the potential to tick-off those whose cars are reported. 'Just read the signs, follow the rules and you won’t have a problem,' Johnson told FoxNews.com.","Canadian app SpotSquad aims to crowd source parking enforcement with a cash incentive .

A man walked into a Catholic church and shot his father-in-law in the back of the head while his wife watched during Mass on Sunday as parishioners were lining up for communion, according to police. Investigators say 35-year-old Charles Richard Jennings Jr, from Ogden, was captured on Sunday afternoon in nearby Box Elder County after fleeing in a stolen pickup truck. Witnesses say they heard one gunshot during the 11:30am Mass at Saint James the Just Catholic Church, and that parishioners immediately hit the floor, with people diving under pews for cover. Suspect: Charles Richard Jennings has been named as the gunman. Jennings reportedly escaped the scene in a stolen a white 1996 GMC truck . The victim was taken to McKay-Dee Hospital in Ogden, where he was listed in critical but stable condition. His name wasn't immediately released. Police say the victim was deliberately targeted by the gunman and it wasn't a random act of violence. Jennings reportedly escaped the scene in a stolen a white 1996 GMC truck. The owner of the truck, who did not want to be named, told police that Jennings jumped over the fence into his yard 'in a state of distress' and was hardly able to talk because he was breathing so heavily. The man was with his 19-month-old daughter while his wife was sleeping indoors. He said to him: 'I need you to help me,' and asked for the keys to his pickup truck. When he refused, Jennings then allegedly took out his gun and said he did not want to hurt anyone. The man handed over his keys and cellphone and Jennings fled. Police were able to track Jennings down after his family called police to tell them he had been in contact with them and wanted to turn himself in. The reason for the shooting is not clear. Saint James the Just Catholic Church in Ogden, Utah: The shooting began just as Sunday mass was getting underway . Rev Erik Richtsteig told Deseret News that people in the congregation were really shaken up by what happened and described the ordeal as 'something no one should have to go through'. The reverend said when the gunman left the church, some parishioners chased after him. 'Nowhere is immune from evil and it's what people do when they're confronted with it that really shows their character,' he said. 'I'm really proud of my people here at the church.' Neighbor Tammy Roe told KUTV she was shocked that Jennings would do such a thing. 'He doesn't seem like that type of . person, I was shocked. I never pictured him as someone who would kill . someone. He was happy-go-lucky.' She has lived next to the Jennings for more than a decade and has no idea why he would want to shoot his father-in-law.

His saga began at the young age of 38 just before the decorated soldier was to serve as a military advisor in the Afghani Parliament. Upon his diagnosis, Lt. Col.

It is based on decades of the soldier’s journals, starting from before his children were even born. A from the official Tell My Sons website: . ‘Dear Matthew, Joshua, and Noah,’ writes Weber. ‘I wrote a book for you. I started writing it long before any of you were born, and even before I met your mom, but it was always written for you.’ Weber continues, explaining in heartbreaking detail what made him write his deeply personal book: . ‘I imagined someday I would have grandkids (yes, grandkids) who might be just as interested in me as I was in my grandparents. And so I started writing a journal, and I kept it brutally honest. Looking back, there’s a lot of stuff I’m really not proud of, but I figure maybe those ugly things reflect my growth through the years. This book comes from that journal.’ Uplifting: To his final days, Weber was a tireless and uplifting public speaker. His book, Tell My Sons, sold 10,000 copies in 3 months and was picked up by Random House . Wise: Lt. Col. Mark Weber wrote his book as a series of letters to the future selves of his sons and wife, pictured, after he knew he wouldn't be there to pass along his wisdom . The book is comprised of nine letters in total, all designed to help his sons and any other reader through their life’s journey. Amazingly, the self-published book quickly sold 10,000 copies. It was then picked up by big name publisher Ballantine and became a New York Times National Bestseller. As his success as a writer quickly began to parallel his success in the military, Weber continued his fight to stay with the family his book makes clear he dearly loved.

Chad Johnson has been released from jail after serving just one week of a thirty day sentence he was handed after patting his attorney on the butt in open court. The former NFL player apologized Monday for disrespecting a judge when he slapped his attorney on the backside in court last week after he’d managed to get a plea deal in a high profile domestic abuse case. Broward County Circuit Judge Kathleen McHugh accepted Johnson's apology and cut back his jail term for a probation violation to the seven days he had already served since the rear-swatting. Johnson, a flamboyant wide receiver formerly known as Chad Ochocinco, said in court that he'd had time to think about why his flippant attitude was wrong — especially in a domestic violence case. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... So sorry: After losing a plea deal for domestic battery last weak for patting his attorney's butt in court, former NFL star Chad Johnson apologized to the judge and a 30-day sentence became a week of time served . 'I just wanted to apologize for disrespecting the court last time,' said Johnson, wearing a tan jail jumpsuit with his hands shackled at the waist. 'I apologize. I did have time to reflect on the mistakes I made in this courtroom.' Attorney Adam Swickle said Johnson will fully comply with all probation conditions and hopes to resurrect his NFL career. The six-time Pro Bowler was cut by the Miami Dolphins after his arrest for battery; he played most of his 11 seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals along with one year with the New England Patriots. 'He understands that this is the kind of situation that can derail a person's career,' Swickle said. 'We're very confident he will do what he should do.' McHugh noted that in a previous hearing, Johnson had put his arm around a female prosecutor's shoulders, prompting her to tell him twice not to touch her. The judge also pointed out that when Johnson head-butted his then-wife, Evelyn Lozada of the reality TV show Basketball Wives, she suffered a three-inch gash on her head that required eight stitches. The judge called those injuries horrific. Second chance: Johnson in court Monday in Ft. Lauderdale. He apologized to Judge Kathleen McHugh, who revoked a plea deal he was given after he patted attorney Adam Swickle in court . First degree butt slapping: Judge Kathleen McHugh (right) refused to accept a plea deal that would have gotten Johnson (left) out of jail time for a probation violation stemming from a domestic violence arrest after he slapped his attorney on the butt.

Johnson walked out of jail shortly after 4 p.m. ET and was met by his attorney, Adam Swickle, and sports agent Drew Rosenhaus. Johnson told reporters he was thankful to McHugh because she was the first person to get him to slow down and think about the path his life was taking. 'No one has been able to do it, not even my parents,' he said. 'I thank her. Everything she did was justified.'

Johnson for 30 days for disrespecting her court. The . court had erupted into laughter when Johnson tapped his lawyer on the . butt moments before the judge had been due to sign a plea agreement. 'This [laughter] is not Mr Johnson's fault,’ Swickle argued. ‘And he should not be punished for the actions of third parties.’ Unamused: Broward Circuit Judge Kathleen McHugh didn't think it was funny when former NFL star Chad Johnson slapped his attorney's butt in court, so she sentenced him to 30 days in jail .

However, Judge McHugh decided to jail Johnson after accusing him of not taking proceedings seriously. When she asked the 35-year-old if he was satisfied with his attorney, Johnson reportedly smacked Swickle's backside. 'I just saw you slap your attorney on the backside. Is there something funny about this?' Judge McHugh said on Monday. Slapped: Chad Johnson, center, leaves Broward County Jail in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in August 2012.

The 380-million-year-old fossils of pre-historic fish could help scientists explain how the modern-day 'six pack’ evolved. Swedish researchers found that the 'miraculously preserved’ placoderm fish from north west Australia had well-developed powerful abdominal muscles 'not unlike the human . equivalents displayed on the beaches of the world every summer'. And this gives scientist a rare opportunity to understand how modern-day abs have developed. Rare soft tissue samples have been found by Swedish scientists in the fossils of fish from the Gogo Formation of north western Australia. They show that the jawed fishes had strong neck and abdominal muscles . Placodermi comes from the Greek for 'plate-skinned' They are an extinct class of prehistoric fish which lived around 400 million years ago - from the late Silurian to the end of the Devonian Period. Their head and thorax were covered by articulated armoured plates and the rest of the body was scaled or naked, depending on the species. Placoderms were among the first jawed fish and their jaws are thought to have evolved from their gill arches. A 380-million-year-old fossil of one species represents the oldest known example of live birth. The fish were found in the Gogo . Formation, a sedimentary rock formation in the Kimberley region of north-western Australia. The area is renowned for being a trove of preserved fossil . fishes including the placoderms - an extinct group that includes some of the earliest jawed fishes. Researchers from Uppsala University in Sweden made this latest discovery and found that the muscle and soft tissue were well preserved. The strong abdominal muscles that Swedish scientists believe would have featured in the jawed fish of the Australian Gogo Formation are 'not unlike' those seen in modern-day human six-packs, such as Daniel Craig's in Bond film Casino Royale, pictured . Bones and teeth fossilise far more easily . than soft tissues and are usually the only traces of the animal that . remain. This makes the rare fossil localities that preserve soft tissues . - such as the one discovered by the Swedish university - all the more valuable. The team, led by Professor Per Ahlberg noticed that the fish would have had a well-developed neck musculature as well as powerful abdominal muscles. Living fish, by contrast, usually have a rather simple body musculature without such specialisations. Ahlberg said: 'This [discovery] shows that vertebrates developed a sophisticated musculature much earlier than we had thought. 'It . also cautions against thinking that we can interpret fossil organisms . simply by metaphorically draping their skeletons in the soft tissues of . living relatives.' Australian researchers had previously . discovered that these fossils contained soft tissue. Now with the . help of Ahlberg's team and the ESRF synchrotron in Grenoble, France, they have managed to resconstruct the . musulcature of the fish.

Couples face being charged more for wedding venue hire, photography and DJs than other events - because businesses hike up their prices when they hear the party is for a wedding. Consumer watchdog Which? found that one venue was prepared to charge its researchers four times as much to hold a wedding than a family party. Researchers posed as engaged couples to get price quotes from venues, DJs and photographers in Edinburgh, London and Manchester for the survey. Some businesses charged couples more when they heard they were booking a wedding, consumer watchdog Which? found . They then approached the same businesses pretending to be booking a family reunion for the same day with the same number of guests, and were often offered better deals. Researchers bartered one photographer down to £320 for the reunion, but were told that £450 was their lowest possible price for the wedding booking. All four DJs contacted by the Which? team bumped up their prices for a wedding. One Edinburgh-based DJ said the wedding would cost between £300 to £350 compared with £200 to £250 for the family party. The researchers had better luck with wedding venues, with only one offering a different price. That venue quoted £850 for room hire with a minimum of 120 guests, even though the Which? team asked to make a booking for 100. When the team called the same place pretending to be holding a reunion for 100 people, they were immediately offered a £200 room without prompting. A Which? spokesman said: 'Our snapshot research reveals some businesses are cashing in on a couple's big day by hiking up prices. One photographer told the undercover team that he could do a family party for £320 but could not go any lower than £450 for a wedding booking . 'We advise people to shop around to find the best deal before signing any contract.' Last month, a study of 1,000 people who got married in the past five years found that the average spend on a venue was £2,164, while the average cost of a photographer was £876. Couples spent £682 on entertainment on average, with 24 per cent telling the Sheila's Wheels study that they felt they were overcharged by wedding suppliers. A fifth said they were too embarrassed to haggle over prices. One in eight said they found themselves £3,000 in debt from their wedding celebrations, with couples spending £18,244 on getting married and enjoying a honeymoon. More than half of the newlyweds (52 per cent) felt wedding costs had spiralled out of control.","One venue charged four times as much for a wedding than a family reunion .

The Night Stalker serial killer who terrorized Southern California in the mid-1980s, also had Hepatitis C and symptoms of chronic drug use when he died of cancer, coroner's officials said Monday. Richard Ramirez died June 7 at age 53 at a hospital where he had been taken for treatment of liver failure. Prison guards have told how the notorious murderer turned bright green from liver failure in the hours before he died. He died of complications from B-cell lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system, according to the Marin County coroner's office. It listed other 'significant conditions' including chronic substance abuse and hepatitis C, which is often spread by the use of intravenous drugs. Devil may care: Satanist and serial killer Richard Ramirez died of complications from B-cell lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system . The drug abuse predated Ramirez's time in prison, said Lieutenant Keith Boyd, assistant chief deputy coroner. 'That's chronic drug use prior to incarceration,' he said. 'There's nothing to support any kind of drug use while incarcerated.' The drug use was the likely cause of the hepatitis C infection that probably lingered in Ramirez's system for a quarter-century before eventually destroying his liver, Boyd said. Ramirez's medical records remain confidential even after his death, said Joyce Hayhoe, a spokeswoman for the federal official who controls medical care in California prisons. Unrepentant: Ramirez was convicted of 13 murders in Southern California in 1984 and 1985, and sentenced to death but died on death row . Terry Thornton, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, could not immediately say if Ramirez had any disciplinary history of using drugs or obtaining contraband in prison. His voluminous file is kept only in hard-copy and would have to be reviewed by hand, she said. Lieutenant Sam Robinson, a prison spokesman, said he could not immediately comment. Ramirez had been on death row at San Quentin State Prison since he was convicted in 1989 of 13 murders in 1984 and 1985. He also was convicted of rape, sodomy, oral copulation, burglary and attempted murder. Executions have been on hold for years, however, because of ongoing legal challenges. Addict: According to the coroner's report, Ramirez had serious conditions that indicated chronic drug use that predated his imprisonment, including hepatitis C . Ramirez was a self-proclaimed Satanist whose trial produced gruesome details about his mutilation of his victims. He was nicknamed the Night Stalker by the media because residents were warned to lock their doors and windows as the killings peaked during the hot summer of 1985. The killer had been entering homes through unlocked windows and doors. He then killed his victims with a gun or knife, burglarized the homes and sexually assaulted his female victims. Ramirez reportedly turned 'a shocking shade of green' before his death from liver failure on Friday June 7.","Coroner reports Richard Ramirez died of complications from B-cell lymphoma .

The contrast of modern and traditional styles can be seen with the mix of natural concrete and warm wood floors. A sliding pane in one of the six living areas opens up the inside entertainment space with a central courtyard, that has a pool, seating areas and balconies. Large windows throughout the home ensure it is filled with natural light, and a geothermal system is used for its heating and cooling needs.

For three months, Austin Craig and Beccy Bingham will attempt to pay rent, buy groceries, eat at restaurants and even go on a road trip using the currency, ditching their credit cards and cash. The experiment will begin when the Provo, Utah, pair return from their honeymoon on July 27.

Bitcoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency, and the coins, worth $107 each on Tuesday afternoon, are kept in an online wallet. The currency, created in 2009, can buy you everything from soap to illegal drugs and bee-keeping equipment. But Bingham and Craig are determined to find out if they can survive using Bitcoin in the real world. 'The idea is to push the outer limits of what's possible with bitcoins,' 29-year-old Craig told the Deseret News. 'A lot of what this documentary is going to be is us figuring it out and having a camera along with us.'

The couple are raising money - and bitcoins - for the documentary and have made a video for their Kickstarter page explaining their unique mission. On the page and in the video they make a desperate appeal for small businesses and stores that accept bitcoins to make themselves known. Bingham's employer has already agreed to pay her in the currency but paying rent will be one of their main hurdles. 'We are going to talk to our landlord,' Bingham told the newspaper. 'We are going to call him up and tell him what we're doing and see if he'll take Bitcoin.' Road trip: The couple, pictured, is planning to buy a car and go on a road trip using Bitcoin .

'It's going to be talking to people, explaining how Bitcoin works, why it's beneficial, and persuading them that we can do this and it will be very painless for you,' Craig said. If things are going really well, the couple hope to use the currency to travel to another country - one where Bitcoin has support. But that will require them to find a travel agency or airline that will take them, and that may prove a feat too much.","Austin Craig and Beccy .

'I'm not an emotional guy, but it's awesome to see her doing so well,' Florida Sunstar paramedic Christopher Jennings told TampaBay.com after seeing Ireland Nugent in Largo on Wednesday. 'It's good closure for us,' the 33-year-old said, like so many of the other paramedics celebrating her miraculous recovery around him. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

The estate known as Linden Hill, which once housed the soup heir's vast collection of more than $120million worth of art and over $100,000 in wine, is being sold off by its current owner venture capitalist Robert Burch. The property with eight bedrooms and ten bathrooms stands in a 50 acre estate in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, has been restored to its heyday by Burch and it now resembles again the home John Dorrance Sr's son once acquired. Mansion: The vast property is only the main building on the 50-acre grounds previously owned by the soup heir . Not condensed: The property has 7 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms . Restored: The current owners have restored the property to its heyday - the appearance that caught the attention of Campbell's soup heir John Dorrance Jr .

It was Dorrance Sr's scientific knowledge that led him to a way to take water out of the can and thereby substantially cutting the transportation costs. Condensed soup turned the business around overnight. Around . the same time a company executive attended a Cornell-Penn football game . and was moved by Cornell's red and white uniforms to suggest a . redesign. By 1922 . the company changed it's name to Campbell's Soup Company and the household brand was born. Assuming the company's . presidency, Dorrance Sr acquired a vast and enviable wealth until his death in 1930. John Jr, also known as Jack, worked through the ranks and took the helm in 1962, building upon his father's hard work.

Room with a view: Dorrance's love of art can still be seen in the home despite the fact it was sold on after his death in 1989 . No red and white: The property comes with 8 ornate fireplaces, stable and an aviary . He oversaw the company's development into frozen dinners and was in charge when Andy Warhol painted his first Campbell's soup can.

If you worry about spending hours on Facebook, then relax - it could be good for your health. The social networking site may help prevent the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases, a new study suggests. Researchers from the University of Colorado found that sexual health advice on the site encouraged condom use among teenagers, decreasing the chance of them spreading STDs. They recruited 1,578 young adults between 18 and 24 for the study. Some were asked to ‘Like’ and receive news from a sexual-health Facebook page called Just/Us, which shared articles about condom use and sexually transmitted infection testing. Another group signed up to a Facebook page called 18-24 News, which provided general news items targeted to the age group. The idea was to see whether receiving updates from a sexual health-based page - rather than a general news page - made the young adults more likely to wear condoms. When the researchers conducted a survey two months later, they found 68 per cent of people signed up to the sexual advice site had used condoms during their last sexual encounter, compared to just 56 per cent in the news group. Furthermore, the proportion of sexual acts where a condom had been used was 63 per cent in the first group, but only 57 per cent in the news group. The study is published in the November issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Unfortunately, the effects of the sexual health information appeared to wane over time. After six months there was no difference in condom use between the two groups. Facebook could be a valuable tool in promoting safe sex as more than 73 per cent of young people have a social media account . Lead researcher Sheana Bull said the use of social media such as Facebook to influence sexual behaviour was novel. ‘It is a first step in considering how to reach the overwhelming numbers of youth online, and how to maximise approaches to technology-based interventions,’ said Professor Bull, of the Colorado School of Public Health. She added that many young people don’t always have access to regular health care, yet 73 per cent use social media. 'Therefore it may provide a viable alternative to promote safe sex,’ she said. Young people under 25 experience the highest rates of STDs in the UK, according to figures from the Health Protection Agency. The peak age for an infection in women is between 19 and 20 years, and in men between 20 and 23 years. Of all 16-19 year olds diagnosed with . an STI, at least 11 per cent of women and 12 per cent of men will . become re-infected within a year.","Young people who 'Liked' a sexual health advice site were more likely to use condoms than those who didn't .

Sarah Murnaghan, the 10-year-old girl who underwent a double lung transplant after her family launched a national campaign, has taken 'a tiny step in the right direction', her mother has said. The youngster, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, underwent the life-saving procedure last Wednesday and has been in intensive care ever since. 'Sarah made a tiny step in the right direction, being able to back off some of her vent settings in terms of her O2 requirements,' her mother Janet Ruddock Murnaghan posted on Facebook. 'Sarah's x-rays improved a little today too. She is still fully sedated and critical.' Scroll down for video . Doing well: Ten-year-old Sarah Murnaghan is taking steps in the right direction after she underwent a double lung transplant, her mother Janet (right) said on Facebook . Sarah's parents, from Newtown Square, . Pennsylvania, were briefed on her progress throughout the six-hour . procedure last week. Surgeons had no challenges resizing or . transplanting the lungs. 'We . expect it will be a long road, but we're not going for easy, we're . going for possible,' Sarah's mother wrote on Facebook after the . operation. 'And an organ donor has made this possible for her.' Sarah's plight sparked a national . debate over organ transplant policies, which until now barred children . younger than 12 from the adult waiting list. On Wednesday, Sarah's mother said that a set of lungs had become available for her daughter. 'God is great! He moved the mountain! Sarah got THE CALL,' a statement posted on her Facebook page read. 'Please pray for Sarah's donor, her HERO, who has given her the . gift of life.' On Wednesday afternoon, Sarah's mother spoke to a reporter from Fox 29 . about her daughter's searching, describing the family as being nervous . but  'excited' about the surgery because doctors had given her child . about a week to live, and they were out of options. In this May 30, 2013 file photo provided by the Murnaghan family, Sarah Murnaghan, center, celebrates the 100th day of her stay in Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with her father, Fran, left, and mother, Janet . 'We're just so thankful for the donor,' Ruddock Murnaghan said, adding that while it is a great day for her, it is not lost on her that it is a tragic day for the donor's family, who had lost a loved one. Last week, the Murnaghans scored a . major victory when a judge ordered the Organ Procurement and . Transplantation Network to add the 10-year-old to the list for adult . lungs. The family's battle waged in the . media and on social networks has inspired other parents of children in dire need of organ transplants to . challenge the existing lung allocation process. Javier Acosta, 11, who suffers from . the same illness as Sarah, is now also awaiting a new set of lungs at . Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where the little girl is currently . undergoing surgery. On Wednesday, Mrs Murnaghan said . that had it not been for the judge's recent ruling, they would not have . gotten this set of lungs, which likely came from an adult or teenager. 'Sarah would've been number 400 or something on the list,' she said. The Organ Procurement and . Transplantation Network added the 10-year-old to the list on Wednesday night after . U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson's original ruling on June 5th.. The . ruling applied only to Sarah, who has end-stage cystic fibrosis and has . been awaiting a transplant at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. 'Incredibly agonizing': U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told a congressional panel on Tuesday that she wouldn't overrule federal regulations to help save young Janet . Fears: Janet and Fran Murnaghan criticized the regulations that kept Sarah from getting an adult lung . An expert has questioned the decision on medical and ethical grounds. Lung transplants are the most difficult of organ transplants, and children fare worse than adults, which is one reason for the existing policy, said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone Medical Center. He called it troubling, and perhaps precedent-setting, for a judge to overrule that medical judgment, and predicted a run to the courthouse by patients who don't like their place on the waiting list. 'I'm not sure I want judges or congressmen or bureaucrats trying to decide what to do with organs at the bedside,' Caplan said. The Murnaghans said pediatric lungs are rarely donated, so they believe older children should have equal access to adult donations. Holding on: Before the transplant last Wednesday, doctors said Sarah had just a week left to live . Support: Sarah, who has been living in hospital since February, is pictured with her three younger siblings . Nationwide, about 1,700 people are on the waiting list for a lung transplant, including 31 children under age 11, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. The Murnaghans' attorney, Steve Harvey, said a committee of the organization that sets transplants policy may meet next week and he hoped it would change the policy. Joel Newman, spokesman for the United Network for Organ Sharing that operates the nation's transplant network, said he was unaware of any previous court order that overruled a transplant policy.","The national organ transplant network complied with a judge's unusual order and placed Sarah Murnaghan, 10, on the adult waiting list .

The memory of an inspirational anti-war campaigner, who camped outside the Houses of Parliament for ten years in protest, will feature in a musical production. Brian Haw became a familiar face to MPs and a controversial hero to civil rights campaigners as he protested about sanctions against Iraq and wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan until he died in 2011. His family has given their blessing for the Youth Music Theatre to create According to Brian Haw. His son Peter even worked with the group to bring his father’s story to life. Life or Brian: A musical about anti-war campaigner Brian Haw, who camped outside the Houses of Parliament for ten years, is set to take the stage . Becoming a beacon for civil rights campaigners, Haw used a megaphone, posters with angry messages and horrific photos of war victims to attack government policies. Haw and his followers fought off all legal attempts to remove the camp from Parliament Square and was arrested on several occasions. Mr Haw, one of the protester’s seven children, worked as an adviser for the production which will begin at Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, west London on August 20. The 31-year-old said that the family completely supported his father’s decision to carry out the protest but found it hard to handle his absence as they grew up in Redditch, Worcestershire without him. Family support: Haw's son Peter Haw said the family have given their blessing for the Youth Music Theatre to create the production about his life and the protest camp (pictured) where he spent ten years . Hold the politicians to account: Haw and his followers fought off all illegal attempts to remove the camp from Parliament Square including this eviction attempt in 2007 . He told The Times: ‘While I completely supported his decision to do what he was doing, it was heartbreaking for him to be away from us.’ Haw once told journalists that he had left his family to campaign for other families suffering in war zones. Familiar face to MPs: Haw used a megaphone, posters with angry messages and horrific photos of war victims to attack government policies . He said: ‘I want to go back to my own . kids and look them in the face again, knowing that I’ve done all I can . to try and save the children of Iraq and other countries who are dying . because of my Government’s unjust, amoral, fear- and money-driven . policies.’ Mr Haw said his . father missed 70 family birthdays but that the family stood by him and . their mother Kay, who divorced him a year into his protest. Mr Haw said: ‘He wanted to hold the politicians to account. He wanted them to see him every time they came out.’ Haw died in 2011 from lung cancer after years of sleeping rough took its toll on his health. Haw was the son of a soldier who was one of the first to enter the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp after it was liberated from the Nazis. Haw spent time in the merchant navy and worked as a carpenter, but his evangelical Christian faith drove him to seek out suffering. He visited Northern Ireland during the Troubles and travelled to the killing fields of Cambodia. In April 2002 Westminster City Council began legal action to remove him under the Highways Act, but the case never came to court. The council later limited the hours he could use a megaphone to attack Government policies. In 2005 the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act restricted the right to protest in designated areas within 1km of the Houses of Parliament but the High Court ruled that Haw could apply to the police for permission to continue his demonstration. In 2006 police seized 90 per cent of Haw’s placards overnight on the grounds that he had breached these restrictions. However, a judge later found that there was no case to answer. Permanent protest: Haw died of lung cancer in 2011 after the years he spent sleeping rough took its toll on his health . The Greater London Authority successfully got permission to evict Haw from the grass area at the centre of Parliament Square in 2011. His protest was immortalised in January 2007 when former Turner Prize nominee Mark Wallinger recreated his camp at the Tate Britain gallery. He also won a Channel 4 News award for Most Inspiring Political Figure in 2007. James Atherton and Sarah Nelson worked with Mr Haw to create the 120 minute musical.

A grand jury has indicted a former attorney on charges he strangled his ex-wife and tossed her off a cruise ship in Italy almost seven years ago. The Orange County Register says 55-year-old Lonnie Kocontes, of Florida, didn't enter a plea at his arraignment on Monday. He was indicted on Friday on a charge of murder for financial gain. He'll try to have the case dismissed at a June 26 hearing, arguing that local authorities lack jurisdiction to prosecute. Charged: Lonnie Kocontes, left, was indicted with Kanesaki's murder, pictured right, nearly seven years after her death . Mr Kocontes and 52-year-old Micki Kanesaki were divorced but had lived together on and off in Mission Viejo. They were sharing a cabin on a 2006 cruise when she went overboard. Her body later washed ashore. An investigation began after Lonnie Kocontes began taking money from her accounts. He was arrested earlier this year. The cruise ship trip was meant to rekindle their failed marriage. But Lonnie Kocontes was arrested in Safety Harbor, Florida in February and indicted with the 2006 murder of Micki Kanesaki. Kocontes . told police that Kanesaki, whom he was divorced from at the time, left . their cabin around 1 a.m. for a cup of tea on May 26, 2006, but never . returned. He later suggested she may have been suicidal. Rocky romance: The cruise was meant to rekindle their failed marriage that spanned both her arrest for domestic assault and his for sexual acts and lewd conduct on a child, Kanesaki seen here . Smooth sailing: Kocontes told authorities that the couple were working to rekindle their failed marriage and during their Mediterranean cruise hadn't fought but instead discussed getting remarried that November (file photo) Kanesaki's body was found the next day after washing on shore in Calabria, in southwest Italy. At the time investigators suggested that foul play was not involved but an autopsy later revealed she had been strangled, KCAL reports. Kocontes said the cruise was meant to rekindle their failed marriage that withstood both . her two-time arrest for domestic assault and his for sexual acts and lewd . conduct on a child - his charges later dropped. Kocontes . told authorities that his ex-wife had previously talked of committing . suicide suggesting it as a possible reason for her death. That was a . claim her mother fiercely denied. 'There's no reason to believe it was a suicide,' her mother Setsuko Kanesaki told the OC Register through a translator in 2006. She said her daughter appeared particularly upbeat before their trip and had plans to see them after her return. Kanesaki's father also told KCAL in 2006 he suspected Kocontes had something to do with it. Home: The couple who divorced after six years of marriage in 2002 continued to live together in this Southern California house they both legally owned and later fought over its sale . Denial: Kanesaki's family denied allegations that their daughter was suicidal with her father, seen here in 2006, saying he believed Kocontes might have something to do with it . 'I . was committed to this woman,' Kocontes told the LA Times just after her . death. 'I loved her with all my heart. I wish I never had gone on the . cruise.' The couple divorced after six years . of marriage in 2002 but continued to live together in the Southern . California house they both legally owned for a few years after their . split. During this time Kanesaki was . arrested for domestic violence and ordered to attend a program with . Kocontes. After her second arrest in January of 2003 for kicking her . ex-husband in the leg, she enrolled herself in anger management classes . as well as an Alcoholics Anonymous program. Kocontes had his own arrests as well including the 1999 arrest for sexual acts and lewd conduct on a girl under . 16. Those charges were dropped after the girl allegedly became too distraught to testify in court, the LA Times reports. After their divorce Kocontes later briefly remarried for a few months and around the fall of 2005 he asked a judge to force Kanesaki to sell their Landera Ranch home and split the proceeds. That case was dismissed after both failed to show up in court. Just several months later they embarked on the cruise that was said to have been an effort to give their marriage another go. Kocontes told police their relationship was getting better and they weren't fighting on the trip but instead discussed remarrying that November.","Autopsy revealed Micki Kanesaki, 52, had been strangled before thrown off a cruise ship passing Italian coast .

Ms Park praised Facebook's achievements in becoming the world's most popular social network, and joked: 'It is pleasing to meet people via Facebook, but it is even more pleasing to meet face to face like this.' Mr Zuckerberg is usually seen in a charcoal-grey hoodie, but has been known to dig out a suit during meetings with world leaders such as Russia's Dmitry Medvedev. However, he soon returned to his favoured laid-back look when he visited the Samsung headquarters for a meeting with executives. Change: Mr Zuckerberg later wore his trademark hoodie for a visit to the headquarters of Samsung . Mobbed: The tech mogul was surrounded by fans when he landed at Seoul airport on Monday . Facebook is keen to collaborate closely with Samsung, the world's largest manufacturer of smartphones, in order to start making money from users who access the social network through their mobiles. Ms Park, who heads the fourth-largest economy in Asia, is keen to promote entrepeneurship in South Korea and to boost the tech sector in order to lift employment rates. In April, she invited Microsoft's Mr Gates and Google CEO Larry Page to the country for a series of talks. The summit was overshadowed by a notorious photograph showing Mr Gates and Ms Park shaking hands while the American had his other hand in his pocket, prompting accusations of disrespect.

The meteor that exploded over Russia's Ural Mountains last week is the biggest space rock to have hit earth in more than a century, scientists have claimed. The 100,000 tonne rock, measuring around 55 feet in diameter, created a huge hole in a frozen lake when it crashed into the ground. Scientists have found more than 50 tiny fragments of the meteor, allowing them to uncover information about its contents. Scroll down for video . Ice hole: Experts said the meteor that left a 50-foot hole in a frozen lake on the outskirts of Chelyabinsk, in the Urals, weighed around 100,000 tonnes and measured 55 feet in diameter . Space rock: Viktor Grokhovsky, who led the expedition from Urals Federal University, said that 53 fragments of the meteor have been plucked from the ice-covered Chebarkul Lake . Rock of proof: On Saturday, divers searched the waters beneath the ice for traces of space rock but surfaced empty handed, leaving some experts questioning whether the hole was indeed formed by a piece of falling debris . Local residents have been . more interested in the black market value of the fragments since the dramatic incident, as a 'gold . mine' has been kickstarted fior the valuable pieces. As they search for their own pieces of . the meteor, rocks have already been put on the internet for sale, and police . are warning all purchasers to prepare for possible fraud. The meteor injured nearly 1,500 . people and caused widespread property damage in Chelyabinsk city on . Friday, with health officials saying that 46 of the injured remain . hospitalised. The debris narrowly missed a direct . and devastating hit on the industrial city which has a population of . 1.13 million but spread panic through its streets as the sky above lit . up with a blinding flash. Lab tests: Service pieces of a meteorite are displayed in a laboratory in Yekaterinburg after being recovered from near Lake Cherbarkul in the Chelyabinsk region. A total of 53 pieces have been brought for analysis to the university in Yekaterinburg . Paul Chodas of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program Office said: 'We would expect an event of this magnitude to occur once every 100 years.' He told the Wall Street Journal: . 'When you have a fireball of this size we would expect a large number . of meteorites to reach the surface and in this case there were probably . some large ones.' Viktor Grokhovsky, who led the . expedition from Urals Federal University, said that 53 fragments of the . meteor have been plucked from the ice-covered Chebarkul Lake. He said they are less than a . centimeter (half an inch) in size, about 10 per cent iron, and belong to . the chondrite type, the most common variation of meteorites found on . Earth. Divers inspecting the lake have found . nothing at the bottom, but Mr Grokhovsky said a fragment as large as . 50-60 centimeters (20-24 inches) could eventually be found there. Worth up to £6,500: These tiny fragments are said to be valuable and some are already being auctioned online after they were found near Lake Cherbarkul in the Chelyabinsk region of Russia . Terrifying: Almost 1,200 people were injured when the meteor burst through the Earth's atmosphere at a speed of 46,000mph on Friday, blowing out the windows of 900 schools and hospitals and damaging around 100,000 homes . Workers in the city remained busy . replacing acres of windows shattered by a powerful shockwave caused by . the meteor's strike, which NASA said released 500 kilotons of energy, . the power equivalent to more than 30 Hiroshima bombs. The local governor estimated the . damage at 1 billion rubles (£21.5million) and said he hopes the federal . government will provide at least half that amount. Lidiya Rykhlova, head of the . astronomy department at the Moscow-based Institute for Space Research, . said experts have drafted a program that envisages building powerful . telescopes, including space-based ones, to warn against potentially . dangerous asteroids, comets and other threats. Fragments have started to appear on . Avito.Ru, a Russian website for classified ads. Many pieces were . harvested around Chelyabinsk, where more than 1,000 were injured as the . meteor disintegrated overhead. Flash of light: The debris narrowly missed a direct and devastating hit on the industrial city which has a population of 1.13 million but spread panic through its streets as the sky above lit up with a blinding flash . One user asked for around £6,500 for a . small piece, while another offered 18 pieces for £11 each. Residents of . a village near Chelyabinsk searched the snowy streets, collecting . stones they hoped would prove to be the real thing. But . not all were ready to sell. 'I will keep it. Why sell it? I didn't have . a rich lifestyle before, so why start now?' a woman in a pink woollen . hat and winter jacket, clutching a small black pebble, told state television Rossiya-24. On Saturday, divers searched the . waters beneath the ice for traces of space rock but surfaced empty . handed, leaving some experts questioning whether the hole was indeed . formed by a piece of falling debris. 'Wake-up call': Experts said asteroid 2012 DA14 should drive nations to work together to create a warning system . If an early warning system existed countries could prepare for the destruction caused by asteroid debris . As it raced through the sky, the . 50-foot wide chunk of space rock compressed the air ahead of it, . creating the enormous temperatures that meant it exploded in a fireball . somewhere between 18 and 32 miles above the ground at around 9.20am . local time on Friday. Although . some debris fell to earth, ‘whipping up a pillar of ice, water and . steam’ and creating a 20-foot-wide crater, the damage in nearby towns . was actually caused by shockwaves created by the meteor breaking the sound barrier and then exploding. Collectors . from around the world will be keen to get hold of a piece. Film . director Steven Spielberg is a noted collector. In October a 9in piece . of the Seymchan meteorite found in Siberia in 1960 sold in New York for . $43,750 (£28,200). Astronomers have also revealed that the meteor could have hit UK cities if it had hit at a slightly different time of day.

Photographer: Lagerfeld made the comments on the set of his new Karl Lagerfeld eyewear campaign . Speaking about the new range, Lagerfeld said: 'They [the glasses] balance ugly faces and they make beautiful faces more beautiful.' Bizarrely, the dark glasses fanatic then added: 'I wear glasses all the time, so it's like selling my soul.' The German designer is no stranger to controversy, and has racked up an impressive number of offended parties during his 66-year career. Most recently he took a swipe at French actress, Audrey Tatou, describing her portrayal of Coco Chanel in Coco Before Chanel as 'unsexy'. 'She played it like women's lib,' he explained, 'like Simone de Beauvoir 30 years before The Second Sex. No, no, no, no. Chanel was a different kind of woman.' Apparently Mr Lagerfeld's publicists were 'horrified' by his his remarks about Miss Tautou, especially as she was formerly the face of Chanel No. 5. However, he is not alone in his criticism and when the Anne Fontaine-directed feature, Coco Before Chanel, was released four years ago others also picked holes in her performance.

Success: 32-year-old De Brauw has previously featured in campaigns for Givenchy and MaxMara among others . Popular: Spaniard Jon Kortajarena, 28, has featured in campaigns for Tesco, Versace and Etro among others . Other recent controversies include revelations that he would marry his cat, Choupette, if he could. ‘[There is] no marriage, yet, for human beings and animals,' said the Chanel supremo. ‘I never thought that I would fall in love like this with a cat.’ So famous for his confrontational way with words has Lagerfeld become, a new book is to be released in September that brings together the best and bitchiest Lagerfeld quotes. The World According To Karl is the brainchild of Patrick Mauriés, Jean-Christophe Napias and Sandrine Gulbenkian, and will feature illustrations by artist Charles Ameline. Choice quotes featured in the book include his famous dismissal of Russian men as ugly and his unique take on Greece's financial woes. 'If I was a woman in Russia I would be a lesbian, as the men are very ugly,' he quipped. 'There are a few handsome ones, like Naomi Campbell's boyfriend, but there you see the most beautiful women and the most horrible men.' On Greece, the fashion maestro sniffed: 'Greece needs to work on a cleaner image. It's a big problem, as they have this reputation of being so corrupt. 'You can't be sure the money will go where it's supposed to go,' he concluded. 'Nobody wants Greece to disappear, but they have really disgusting habits.

Norland College in Bath, Somerset, has been training professional nannies for the rich and famous since 1892. But, to meet the needs of modern wealthy parents, the college has now added getaway driving and martial arts to the curriculum in order to protect babies in their care. Students now undergo rigorous stunt and evasive techniques to enable them to drive at high speed in any weather conditions and escape the potential grip of attackers. Abby Harris, 19, said the new modules are essential to her training as future clients are likely to be a potential target for crooks. 'It's a really crucial part of training', she said.

'It teaches you things like how to get away from the paparazzi or if you're being chased as well as if you are on black ice or something like that.

Prestigious: Norland nannies are known as the creme de la creme of the childcare world and are firm favourites of royals, celebrities and the super-rich . Defence: Trainee nannie Fiona Searle shows how she would defend a baby in her care in the face of an attacker . The trainees - who pay £36,000 for the four-year BA Honours degree course - are taught everyday skills such as first aid, sewing, fitting car seats and cooking. As well as housekeeping skills, the college now prepares the girls for the 21st Century version of childcare - by taking its second-year students to Castle Combe Racing Circuit in Wiltshire, for driving lessons with a difference. The class teaches students how to deal with icy roads and how to safely get away from anyone trying to get to the children in their care. Driving instructor John Yeo, who normally trains bodyguards, said the nannies course was 'tough and realistic'. Essential: As well as the self-defence skills, nannies at Norland also learn the housekeeping skills. Norland nannies are pictured here in the 1970s .

'And we know when they go out there and that happens they've got the best chance possible of keeping safe.' They also undergo Tae Kwon-Do self-defence training where they learn to manoeuvre prams away from kidnappers and give themselves the best chance at escaping or alerting attention. Claire Burges, lecturer and former graduate of Norland College, believes the college's founder, Emily Ward, would have loved the new additions to the prospectus. She said: 'When Emily Ward set up Norland, it was forward thinking it was always thinking about what was needed for the children in the families that the nannies were going to be caring for.

A middle class couple are being investigated under noise nuisance laws after they installed a high pitched 'mosquito' alarm to stop teenage vandals from loitering outside their home. Royal Mail manager Scott Smith, 39, and his partner Andrea Riley, 43, purchased the alarm which causes ear discomfort to people aged under 25 after suffering months of vandalism, abuse and even air gun attacks on their mini Pom dog. Now whenever the gang of vandals, who have also made racist comments to Burmese Miss Riley, approach the couple's home in Royton, near Oldham, Greater Manchester, they can activate the alarm which forces them to move out of its 40 yard range. But the device has now landed the couple . in trouble with their local council - after neighbours complained it . was hurting their children's ears. Scroll down to test your hearing . Andrea Riley, pictured left with her Pom dog Elle, installed a 'mosquito' alarm outside her home in Royton, Oldham, Greater Manchester, pictured right by the couple's bedroom window, to deter teenage vandals . Last resort: Miss Riley and her partner Scott Smith purchased the alarm after months of being targeted by teenage vandals who damaged their cars and attacked their dog . The legal alarms have previously been used at shopping centres to disperse gangs of youths - as their high pitched frequency generally can't be heard by people aged over 25. So after months of struggling to get rid of the teenage vandals, Mr Smith and Miss Riley forked out £600 for a 'Mosquito' device of their own - and now turn it on from their bedroom if youngsters start causing trouble outside. But the couple's neighbours have complained the device has forced them to get medical treatment for their children because of headaches, ear problems and even physical sickness caused by the 'mosquito' alarm. The couple are being investigated by council environmental health officials for possible noise nuisance offences. Mr Smith said: 'There has been an ongoing problem and this is the only thing that seems to have worked. I'm not a grumpy old man who hates children. Michelle Plevin, who lives next door to Scott Smith and Andrea Riley, claims her two-year-old son Cason is suffering ill affects from the couple's alarm . 'Because Andrea is Maltese some of the children started making racist comments. There was damage to our cars because the kids kept hitting them with footballs. Our dog got hurt. 'And they make a lot of noise when we have come home from working very long days. This device has been a miracle for us.' Mr Smith and Miss Riley, a care worker who have lived at their house for 20 years, said the street had become like a 'council estate' with his Audi TT car being scratched and bumped. On one occasion, chip pan oil was even poured around Miss Riley's Fiat 500. The couple also claim their mini Pom dog, Elle, has been attacked by children with air guns and Miss Riley has been subjected to racist rants. Mr Smith said: 'We were struggling to cope with the all the trouble we've had and the police unofficially recommended this device to us. McDonald's and Tesco use it so I couldn't see a problem with us using it. 'We don't leave it on 24/7 and we use it sensibly. It is legal to have and use in Europe and it is no higher than a busy road and it is set to two decibels under the legal requirements. 'There is nothing wrong with kids playing, but it escalates and they get rowdy and they start screaming and swearing. We fear as though we are the bad guys when we have nothing but problems with some kids. They climb in and out of the windows, kick doors in, sometimes we have it until 11.30pm and they will throw things over the fence. 'We are worn out with it and it is putting tension on our relationship whilst dealing with stressful jobs. We are pushed to the limit but when we first used the device, it shifted them on and we even gave each other a celebratory hug. 'We thought it was worth the price but to be honest I would have even paid £5,000 for it. It's on show, we are not hiding it at all and it seems to be a deterrent. 'We are the victims. They are saying the children are on medication and are having headaches but it is a totally legal device. You just switch it on - even the police use it. Deterrent: The Mosquito alarm can be seen by the second left top window outside the couple's home in Royton, Oldham, Greater Manchester . 'We are in work all day and we do 50-60 hours a week and we dreaded coming home so we are making excuses to stay at work longer. 'We had the conservatory done only two years ago and spent over £30,000 on our house and yet we can't sit there and enjoy it anymore. We have even tried sitting out with earphones on but they are still throwing stuff. They run riot.' Miss Riley added: 'We feel as though no one is helping us, we understand that the police are on cutbacks and have limited resources but we are fighting a losing battle. We just want a quiet life. 'We had 15 years of pure bliss where we could just hear the birds and it was a proper neighbourhood with people working like ourselves. But because of the current climate it has changed, people can't afford to rent so the social takes the house and we get people like that. The last thing I expected was to have problems with neighbours. The 'mosquito' alarm emits a screeching noise, similar to nails down a blackboard, at 17.5kilohertz.. The range of human hearing declines with age, so although teenagers can hear the noise, it's too high for adults aged over 25. Human conversation is usually at around eight kilohertz, but can range up to 16kilohertz. Most people don't report problems with their hearing until they cannot hear conversation. The device doesn't affect family pets. 'I feel really harassed. I feel as . though I am being pushed to the limits and I'm very stressed. They all . congregate around my wall and I am at my wits end. The kids all shout . 'Paki woman Paki woman' at me over and over. They taunt me. 'If you give me the golden ticket I will be out of here. We have worked hard all our lives to avoid living on a council estate and that's what our street has turned in to now.' But their neighbour, mother-of-four Michelle Plevin, 27, a hairdresser who lives next door to the couple said: 'The alarm is on for twenty minutes at a time and whenever it comes on the children know about it straight away. 'They can't play outside anymore because the noise bothers them so much. My youngest has problems with his ears as it is and the alarm has made him physically sick before. He cries and says it hurts and there is nothing I can do to help him. It's awful. 'I understand that they don't want kids on their property or near their cars but my children keep themselves to themselves. They just play together and I don't see what is wrong with that. 'They only ever play in the garden because they're not allowed to play on the road. I know they make a bit of noise when they're on the trampoline but that can't be helped. 'They are children and they should be able to play in their own garden without being bothered by this horrible alarm.' Labour councillor Steven Bashworth from Oldham Council said: 'Officers from the Environmental Health department have visited the steet and spoken to the owner and local residents. We are carrying out a thorough investigation and cannot comment further. 'Oldham Council is committed to investigating any noise complaints and we will always take the appropriate action.'","Scott Smith and his partner Andrea Riley suffered months of abuse from teenage vandals who damaged their cars and attacked their dog .

Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas has announced that he will resign amid claims his chief-of-staff and alleged lover recruited government agents to spy on his wife. Necas, 48, has been embroiled in a sleaze scandal that has seen seven people, including the current and former heads of the . Military Intelligence agency and three former politicians of his party, charged with bribery or misuse of power. But most sensational is the arrest of his closest aide and the head of his office Jana Nagyova who was charged with ordering a military intelligence agency to spy on three people, including Necas’ estranged wife, Radka. Necas has insisted that he knew nothing of Nagyova's alleged skullduggery nor did she push him into divorcing his wife. Affair? Patr Necas (left) is alleged to have had an affair with his chief-of-staff Jana Nagyova (right) who herself is accused of ordering government agents to spy on Necas' wife . Nagyova is also alleged to have . bribed three senior MPs to step down in return for lucrative jobs in . state-run companies. She faces five years in jail for abuse of power if . convicted. She claims she ordered security . services out of concern for Mrs Necas, far from the nefarious motives of . which she has been accused. Her lawyer said: 'This [surveillance] . was not done for the reason of damaging someone or harming them but . rather, due to being cautious, she rached the conclusion that it is . necessary to find out some things.' The ex wife: Necas refused to confirm or deny if Ms Nayova was the reason behind his divorce, finalised last week, to Radna (left), the mother of his four children and teenage sweetheart . Necas said he also will quit on Monday as chairman of his conservative Civic Democratic Party. Asked directly if Ms Nayova was the . reason behind his divorce, finalised last week, to the mother of his . four children and teenage sweetheart, Necas responded: 'I consider these . things to be so bizarre that they do not deserve my comment.' The alleged lover: Nagyova is also alleged to have bribed three senior MPs to step down in return for lucrative jobs in state-run companies. She faces five years in jail for abuse of power if convicted . 'I am aware of my political responsibility,' Necas said. His . decision will end his three-party coalition government, which was . created after the 2010 parliamentary election. But Necas said he hopes . it can stay in power until a parliamentary election planned next year. This is an optimal solution of the current situation,' Necas said. Two coalition partners, the conservative TOP 09 party and the Liberal Democrats, agreed with that plan Sunday. 'We’re obliged to do all we can for the government to continue,' said Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek, the deputy head of TOP 09. That might not happen, however. It is up to the President Milos Zeman to select a new prime minister who would try to form a new government, and it is not immediately clear if he is ready to accept such a solution. The current coalition also doesn’t have a clear parliamentary majority and governs with the help from independent lawmakers. Early elections also are not easy to call because it would have to be approved by three-fifths of the 200 lawmakers, and the opposition does not have enough seats to force it. The negotiations between the parties . are expected to start immediately, and it is not clear how much time . they will need to find a solution to the crisis. Earlier . this week, prosecutors said Nagyova was suspected of directing the . alleged illegal surveillance without any authorization. In their . explanation for the sweeping raids at government offices and other . locations, they said Nagyova’s motives were 'purely private.' Necas . announced earlier this week that he and his wife, Radka, have filed for . divorce. Newspapers have speculated about an affair between him and .

Another major championship, another frustrating disappointment for Tiger Woods, not to mention his worst 72-hole score since he turned professional in 1996. With a round of 4-over-par 74, Woods came in with a 13-over 293 total, a shot higher than his previous worst week, a 12-over at the 2003 PGA Championship. In other words, apart from the three times as a pro he missed a cut in a major championship, Woods never as bad as this. Perhaps the comments made by his currently girlfriend Lindsay Vonn didn't help his concentration? On course: Lindsey Vonn watches boyfriend Tiger Woods from the gallery on the 18th green during the third round of the U.S. Open in Ardmore, Pennsylvania . Watching closely: Vonn has been a staple at major championships since she started dating Woods three months ago . Tiger tamed?

The 28-year-old Olympic skier has . become something of a fixture on the golfing circuit as she has been . pictured keeping a close eye on Tiger at various courses. During a quiet moment at Merion Golf .

We really are . normal in that way. Lots of people go home and talk to their wife or . husband about their job. That’s what we do.' There'll be lots to discuss when the two of them go home. His tie for 32nd place was his worst finish as a pro at the U.S. Open. Biggest fan: Vonn waits near the clubhouse as she watches Woods during what has been a rocky performance by the golfer .

'I'll . look back at the things I did right and the things I did wrong.' The No. 1-ranked player in the world never broke par at the U.S. Open, with four rounds in the 70s. Woods, who has not won a major since . the 2008 Open in San Diego, had little doubt as to why he played so . poorly this week on a course many thought was ideally suited for his . game. It was all about the putting, he grumbled afterwards. 'I struggled with the speed all week,' Woods said. 'These greens are grainy. I struggled with the speed right around the hole.' Woods missed too many fairways and took too many putts, a simple yet realistic way to look at his week. Just two days ago, Woods was four shots out of the lead. Then, he went 76-74 for his worst weekend in a major championship.

Ringleader: Gordon Coe recruited four accomplices to dupe unsuspecting Brits out of at least £26,000 by pretending to be charity collectors . A gang of bogus charity collectors who stole at least £26,000 from thousands of generous Brits were today jailed for a total of more than nine years. Ringleader Gordon Coe, Pauline Hunt, Susan Christians, husband and wife Kim and Ben Chapman duped unsuspecting donators by shaking fundraising tins for Marie Curie Cancer Care. But instead of giving the cash to help needy cancer patients, they pocketed the money. For three years the con artists toured pubs and clubs across the south of England with fake charity tins and ID badges and urged revellers to donate money. Thousands of people dug deep in the belief they were helping pay for vital palliative care nurses for dying cancer patients. Instead, it was a sickening scam to fund the group's lavish lifestyle, a court heard. All but one of them lived off benefits, unable to work, but still flew off on holidays together in the Dominican Republic, Tenerife and Greece. One of the money launderers themselves even admitted they were ‘the most evil b******* going’. Prosecutor Nicholas Tucker estimated the fivesome, led by Coe, pocketed more than £26,000, based on 260 trips yielding an average £100 each. But more than £40,000 of unaccounted for money was also found in their bank accounts. A judge today jailed them for at least a year each and Coe to four years, to deter others from ‘even thinking about such a scheme’. Charity con artists: Coe's accomplices included Pauline Hunt (right) who had an unexplained £4,753 in her bank account and was jailed for 12 months, and Susan Christians (left) who had £4,454 unaccounted for and was jailed for 18 months. She told police that the group was 'the most evil bastards going' Judge Derwent Hope, Honorary Recorder of Southampton, said the gang had shown ‘little or no remorse’ for scamming a ‘wonderful charity’. He said: ‘This is a shocking case of fraud in which the public and a charity have been abused. ‘No one will ever know the true loss to the Marie Curie fund.I am satisfied they are a wonderful charity who bring relief to terminally ill people and their families, while properly accounting what they receive from generous donors. ‘That is why at the heart of this case there has been a massive breach of trust from each one of you, not just to the members of the public you targeted in public houses but also the Marie Curie fund you defrauded. Pocketed charity money: Husband and wife Ben (right) and Kim Chapman (left) also laundered money pretending to be collectors for Marie Curie Cancer Care. Ben was jailed for 15 months while Kim got a 20 month sentence . ‘I sentence you not only to punish you who have committed these crimes but also to deter anyone else from ever thinking of such a scheme.’ Southampton Crown Court heard Coe, a former pub landlord from Southampton, Hampshire, masterminded the cruel conspiracy in an ‘almost professional’ way, Judge Hope said. Coe applied to become a Marie Curie fundraiser in November 2008, filling in the paperwork and supplied two referees to say he was an honest man. One of these was family friend Chapman, 43, who later joined his money-grabbing team. After passing the vetting process, Coe was sent charity T-shirts, a volunteer fundraiser ID card and a paying-in book to help him collect around the city. A local Marie Curie fundraising manager visited Coe, now 65, to give him about 12 collection tins and lay down their strict regulations. He was forbidden from recruiting others to help him or collecting from pub-to-pub, rules he brazenly ignored. Coe (pictured arriving at court) and his accomplices showed 'little to no remorse' for scamming a 'wonder charity' Judge Derwent Hope said . Coe, an amputee, then rounded up his four accomplices to raise money for ill-gotten gains. He gave them fake ID badges from the charity, tins with home-printed logos and even forged letters of gratitude from the area's fundraising manager. After a night's collecting - travelling to Brighton and even London - the crew would return to Coe's flat to split the takings among themselves. They collected so much that Christians bought herself a washing machine, paid for entirely in coins. Coe took the bulk of the proceeds. Over three years, he put just £263 into the charity bank account, but deposited £31,348 into his own. Coe pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and concealing financial transactions - a trawl of his bank accounts revealed unexplained cash deposits of £31,348 dating back to 2009. He was jailed for four years and 44 months, to be served concurrently. Sentencing Coe, Judge Hope said: ‘You made out you were someone honest the charity could trust and they provided you with all manner of materials. ‘You almost totally abused that trust by providing them with a miniscule amount of the money you and your co-defendants took. ‘You recruited a team of collectors who took up matters enthusiastically in an extensive tour from Bristol to Brighton and even to London and the Home Counties to target public houses.’ Coe was in and out of hospital from September 2010 to July 2011, following a heart attack and the other four carried on collecting on their own, the court heard. Even after the game was up, the fraudsters claimed they took only £20 to £30 petrol money and other ‘expenses’ at the time. Alarm bells first rang in January 2010, when a customer at a Southampton pub challenged Hunt, 55, as she asked for money with a battered charity tin, clutching a tatty ID badge. Outside court: Kim Chapman, Christians and Ben Chapman (left to right) deceived people by making them think they were helping pay for vital palliative care nurses for dying cancer patients . The suspicious customer also rang Marie Curie with his suspicions and concerned charity bosses alerted Hampshire Police as they did not have a woman registered to collect in that area. Organisers also tried to get in touch with Coe, who did not answering their letters and calls. In March, he eventually admitted he knew Hunt and had given her permission to empty tins on his behalf. Police dropped the case as no crime had apparently been committed and the scam grew, with the gang convinced they had the perfect system. Driver Chapman, an electrician, ferried his 45-year-old wife and Christians, 65, from pub to pub to ask for money. When a pub patron challenged Hunt (pictured) as she asked for money, he became suspicious and called the charity who realised they did not have a woman registered for the area . Chapman, the only one with employment, . told police he thought he was earning himself a 'gold star' by doing a . good turn for society. A search of his bank accounts found £445 in unexplained deposits. He was jailed for 15 months. Detectives discovered £860 unaccounted for in his unemployed wife's bank accounts and she was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud and converting criminal property. She was given 20 months jail on each count to be served concurrently. Coe's first recruit, Hunt, had an unexplained £4,753 stashed away in her bank account and jurors found her guilty of converting criminal property. She was jailed for 12 months. Christians, 65, of Dibden, in New Forest, had £4,454 in her bank that could not be accounted for. She cracked under police interview and admitted what had happened, saying: ‘I know it's a nasty thing to do but I've done it, I've got to live with it' adding they were “the most evil bastards going”.’She was jailed for 18 months. A Marie Curie Cancer Care spokesman said: ‘We would like to reassure people this type of incident is extremely rare. ‘We shouldn't let one bad apple give legitimate charity collectors a bad name. ‘The vast majority of collectors are trustworthy and dedicated and, as a charity, we couldn't raise the vital funds we need without them. ‘Generous donations enable Marie Curie Nurses to provide free care to people with terminal illnesses in their own homes and in the charity's hospices.’","Ringleader Gordon Coe and his four accomplices duped unsuspecting donators by shaking fundraising tins .

"By . Chris Parsons . UPDATED: . 06:58 EST, 2 February 2012 . Forecasters warned today that extreme . cold will grip the country over the next few day with the possibility of . snow even in London and the south. The Met Office has maintained its cold weather alert at level three, which means 'severe' conditions. Some areas have been told to expect temperatures of minus -11C and the Army . has been put on standby should conditions get even worse. White wilderness: A hiker takes an early morning walk up to Great Mis . Tor, near Princetown, Dartmoor, yesterday after fresh snow overnight . Wintry sunshine: Snow blows across the rocks near Great Mis Tor on Dartmoor. Devon and Cornwall have already felt the brunt of the snow and ice which is forecast for the rest of the country . Around . four inches of snow and ice are forecast for parts of the country due to a . high-pressure system over Scandinavia which is pushing raw eastern winds towards the UK. Record low temperatures in Eastern Europe have caused dozens of fatalities with 43 dead in . Ukraine alone, where the mercury dropped to -33C. Paul Mott, forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: 'The nights will be . really cold throughout the week and there will be the occasional snow . showers over the eastern counties of England, eastern Scotland and even . London.' Mr Mott said the mercury could plummet . to as low as -10C in rural parts of central England on Thursday night, . with average day time readings only reaching 3C-4C. BBC Radio 5 Live said temperatures could fall as low as -11C. MeteoGroup forecaster Clare . Allen said: 'We've got an easterly wind bringing snow showers off the North Sea. Most areas . of the UK will see daytime maximum temperatures of 2C and 3C. London will be a maximum of 4C, so it's going to be pretty . cold.' Big freeze: Sheep stranded in the snow on Dartmoor. The Met Office . raised its weather alert to level 3 on Monday, meaning severe conditions . Devon and Cornwall have already felt . the brunt of the bad weather. Police in the two counties have warned . motorists not to travel . unless it is essential after snowfalls on Exmoor . and Dartmoor. The icy blast meant staff at Luton Airport had to defrost a fleet of easyJet planes yesterday before passengers could get . on, as temperatures dipped below freezing at the airport in . Bedfordshire. It warned that low temperatures can be especially dangerous for the young and the elderly or those with chronic disease. Winter's here: After one of the mildest winters on record the country is braced for sub-zero temperatures and icy conditions. Here dog walkers enjoy the snow on Dartmoor . Freezy jet: Workers at Luton in Bedfordshire had to defrost a fleet of easyJet planes yesterday before passengers could board as temperatures hit . freezing point . Health chiefs have also started . warning that as a result of the freezing conditions, more than 1,500 . people a week could be killed by the weather. The Department of Health's Chief Medical . Officer said that around 1,560 people, many elderly, would die due to . cold weather each week between now and March in normal winter weather. That figure will rise 'substantially', however, due to extreme cold like . that we are currently experiencing. During last year's big freeze, the death rate in England and Wales shot up by 21 per cent from 9,220 a week to 11,193. Dame Sally Davies said: 'Mortality . rises by 19 per cent in winter months in England, amounting to 27,000 . excess deaths or 1,560 more people per week compared with the rest of . the year. And very severe weather can substantially add to this death . toll. 'The majority of UK deaths are among . older people, especially women, and those with underlying health . problems - but they are not people who would have died anyhow at that . time.' Heavy covering: The snow covered fields of Dartmoor and a misty morning seen from Great Mis Tor, near Princetown yesterday . The military have been put on alert should conditions deteriorate to a Met Office level 4, which means a 'major cold weather incident'. When . freezing conditions struck in 2010, members of the armed forces were . called in to help clear snow from the roads and assist residents in . particularly hard-hit areas. Mobilised soldiers will also help clear . special locations such as doctors’ surgeries, care homes and hospitals. The cold spell breaks what has so far been one of the warmest winters on record. Forecasters said it was becoming . increasingly likely that the freezing temperatures would stick around . and even last through the whole of February. There are fears that the sudden onset could bring travel chaos and catch many drivers off guard. AA . spokesman Luke Bodett said: ‘We have had a very mild winter so far and . motorists need to get into their winter mindset from today. It is going . to be important not to charge around in the way they may have been used . to and be prepared for the unexpected.’ Freezing: A lone walker struggles as heavy wind whips snow up into his face on Dartmoor. In Eastern Europe, record low temperatures have caused dozens of deaths . The Met Office has briefed government . departments and local councils about the cold period so that extreme . weather plans can be put on standby. Meanwhile, well-prepared residents in a Cornish village have . bought their own snowplough and gritter after they were cut off for a . week in a blizzard during previous winters. The Badgall and Laneast Action . Group (Blag), have raised £2,650 to buy the plough and mechanical salt . spreader. Two farmers in the area have been designated to operate them . during heavy snowfall. Blag said residents 'voted with their pockets' after being cut off during the last two winters. Britain has seen very little wintry weather so far this season – but nothing is ever straightforward with our weather. After three consecutive harsh winters we have reverted to what is seen as more typical winter weather. Perhaps this year we have felt cheated by above-average temperatures and just a few frosty mornings. Now the snowdrops have appeared in the garden it seems that spring is not too far away. Prior . to the winter of 2008-09 there had been only one truly harsh winter in . the previous 17 years – and that began late in the season. Cold winds first reached us from Siberia in the final week of January 1995, leading to heavy snow showers. So could there be a sting in the tail this year? History says it can happen, even after one of the mildest winters on record. As . recently as last Wednesday the temperature peaked at 12.1C at Hawarden . in Flintshire, but a band of heavy rain sweeping into the North Sea by . Thursday brought cold winds and snow showers to higher ground. The . prospects for the coming week are for the coldest weather so far, with . hard frosts overnight, snow flurries and perhaps just the higher ground . seeing any heavy snow. Spokesman Paul Stephenson said: 'If . you're out in the rural areas the main roads are beautifully clear, but . our parish is split into a hamlet and village either side of a ridge . with a steep hill on one side and open moorland. 'The situation is that there is just . not the resources for the Highways to cope with the snow, we just have . to wait, and the reality is waiting up to a week before there is . clearance of our road. But we're not trying to emulate the speed and . ferocity of the Highways team.' He said there were many retired . residents in the area so 'we were very keen to mechanise' the removal of . snow rather than relying on manpower. And motorists were being urged to be . vigilant against thieves who are cashing in on the cold weather by . looking for drivers who hate getting into an icy car. Police said the thieves - usually working in a team of two - park in a side street when people are leaving to go to work. Many drivers nip outside and de-ice . their windscreens, and leave their engines running to warm up the car . while they pop back indoors for one last cup of coffee. One thief sneaks from their getaway . car, dives into the motor with the engine running and they both tear off . before the owner can run outside to stop them. Detectives said in a recent incident - in Northampton - a car owner heard their . vehicle being driven away at speed after going back into the house for a . moment. A police spokeswoman said: 'It is . vital that vehicles are clear of frost and snow before driving, but we . would always advise motorists to stay with their vehicle whilst . de-frosting, even if it's parked on their front driveway. 'People may assume that nothing will . happen in a few minutes, however what might only seem like a few minutes . in the house, can provide the small window of time an opportunistic . thief needs. 'This type of crime is preventable . and we urge members of the public to allow extra time to safely clear . their windscreens in the morning. In Eastern Europe, the death toll . from Arctic conditions has risen to at least 89, and Russian gas . provider Gazprom has issued a warning over fuel supplies. In Ukraine, 43 people have died in the past five days, its emergency . ministry said, as the former Soviet republic shivered through its . coldest winter in six years. Overnight temperatures sank as low as -33C . and hundreds of heated tents have been put up to shelter the homeless. Poland, .

Vigil: Nick Fletcher (pictured with his niece), 27, had only just moved into a two-bedroom flat when the accident happened in high winds on Monday . The family of a popular shipbroker fighting for life in hospital after being struck by a telegraph pole were today keeping a bedside vigil for him. Amateur rugby player Nick Fletcher, 27, had only just moved into a two-bedroom flat when the accident happened in high winds on Monday. He was knocked unconscious and suffered a cardiac arrest which left him in a pool of blood in a street in Wandsworth, south-west London. Today Mr Fletcher, who was born in Bromley, Kent, was in a critical but stable condition at St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London. He is one of four children of Philip, 63, and Anne Fletcher, 57. His mother, of Sevenoaks, Kent, called him ‘the nicest guy you could ever meet’. Mrs Fletcher said today: ‘We are all devastated. We are concentrating on his condition rather than how this happened. He is such a lovely boy and has so many friends. 'He is a strong person and a fighter. We are praying that he pulls through. If anyone can, he can. The hospital have been fantastic and the staff are doing all they can. We just have to keep hoping.’ Mr Fletcher, who works for the electronic brokerage firm Icap in the City, was just yards from his new home when the incident happened. He has not yet finished moving in. British Telecom, the Metropolitan Police and the Health and Safety Executive were all investigating the accident. Scroll down for video .

'We are waiting for news of his condition like everyone. His family are probably keeping those details close to their chests, which I absolutely understand given what has happened.’ An Icap spokesman said: ‘Our thoughts are with Nick and his family. We wish him a full and speedy recovery.’ Meanwhile, Britain was forecast to start warming up again this week as passengers on cross-Channel journeys endured the worst of the travel disruption today caused by the continuing mid-March cold snap. Channel Tunnel transit firm Eurostar cancelled 10 services and there were delays of up to two hours on trains that were able to run, as well as problems on Eurotunnel services at Folkestone, Kent. But forecasters said that although this week will still be cold, today was expected to see highs of 6C, while temperatures could reach 7C by Thursday, 8C on Friday and 9C in time for the weekend. Queues: A general view of lorries parked on the M20 near Harrietsham, Kent, as Operation Stack remains in place on the motorway due to the continuing bad weather in northern France .

Meanwhile on the roads there were long tailbacks on the M20 at Folkestone as police put lorries into holding positions as part of Operation Stack, and Jersey and Guernsey airports were shut. Conditions were still hazardous on major roads, including the A19 and A170 in North Yorkshire and the A947 in Aberdeenshire, while drivers on the M9 in Stirling had to contend with sheep on the road. But with temperatures creeping up from mind-numbingly cold to merely fairly chilly, travelling for most road and rail users was far less of a problem than earlier in the week, especially on Monday. It was continuing bad weather in . northern France that caused today's problems for Eurostar - which, as . well as cancelling 10 trains today, advised passengers not to travel . unless they needed to. Due to the hold-ups on the approaches to Folkestone, there were queues for the passenger and freight shuttles on Eurotunnel. Three day forecast: Snow showers are expected to move north throughout the day on Wednesday. Tomorrow will be mainly clear and dry before rain moves in across the country on Friday . Impressive scene: Amazing ice sculptures by the road at Thorrington, . near Colchester, Essex, were caused by the wild weather conditions over . the past few days .

The cold weather was set to continue throughout the day, with temperatures between 2C (35F) and 6C (43F) but feeling colder. Gemma Plumb, a forecaster with . MeteoGroup, said snow showers were forecast for parts of Scotland and . eastern parts of England, especially along the North Sea coast. But that snow was unlikely to settle . and the snowfall that caused chaos across south east England and the . Channel Islands yesterday had cleared, she added. She said: ‘It won't be as cold as . yesterday but it's still colder than average for this time of year. Tonight there will be lows of -5C (23F) to -7C (19F) across the whole . country, so it is still really cold.’ Thousands of travellers endured a . miserable day yesterday as the bitterly cold weather cause havoc for . road, rail, sea and air journeys. Kent and Sussex were worst hit as roads . were blocked by snow and huge queues built up. Jersey Airport was closed . all day and UK passengers were delayed by bad weather at European . airports.

Kent Police dealt with hundreds of . calls from motorists reporting collisions, broken-down vehicles and . abandoned cars as drivers were unable to continue their journeys, . prompting warnings to travel only if necessary. Elsewhere there were strong winds . across large parts of the UK creating hazardous conditions. In . Wandsworth, south west London, a 27-year-old man was left with serious . head injuries after a telegraph pole was blown down. One witness told the London Evening .

Claire . Whicello, 43, said: ‘I initially thought it was a car accident. When I . went down to look I saw a few cars on the side - I thought they had run . into each other. It wasn't until this morning that I found out what had . happened. It's awful, it's dreadful for the poor man - I can't believe . it.' Meanwhile, Met Office . forecaster Emma Sharples yesterday evening told MailOnline a yellow snow . warning remained in place for north and eastern parts of Scotland, . through the north east of England and down through Yorkshire, . Lincolnshire and into The Wash. She said the warning was due to last until 11am this morning. Ms . Sharples added: 'We are still having showers running down the east . coast, so there's potential through that warning period for there to be 2 . to 5cms of snow, but locally up to 10cms, but this will be mainly for . higher ground. 'Elsewhere, away from these locations, we have a fair bit of brighter weather but there will be a scattering of wintry showers.'

White France: A breathtaking view of the Eiffel Tower in Paris under the snow from the Tour Maine-Montparnasse . Misfortune struck the 500 Cherbourg-bound travellers twice as the Irish Ferries sailing from Ireland, expected to be an overnight journey, turned into a two-day calamity. Treacherous conditions in the English Channel prevented the Oscar Wilde - the company's luxury flagship - from docking at the French port as scheduled on Monday at 2pm. But when it finally berthed after five attempts today - 24 hours later than expected - the seafarers, anxious to disembark, were forced to remain onboard a further four hours when the boat's bow doors jammed. Irish Ferries blamed 'a hydraulic failure' for preventing them from letting passengers - including 245 French pupils returning from a school trip to Ireland - back onto dry land. Normally in such circumstances a ship would sail back out of its berth and reverse in again so passengers could alight through the stern, or rear, door. But because conditions in the usually busy crossing remained dangerous, harbour authorities warned the ship's captain against moving the ferry. An Irish Ferries spokesman said all the passengers were 'perfectly safe'. Plans for the ferry to return to Ireland last night were cancelled and a scheduled sailing from County Wexford back to France today has also been axed. Passengers due to travel on the sailings are being contacted while alternative arrangements are being made.","Nick Fletcher only just moved into flat when accident happened on Monday .

The airline has announced that it plans to join several other major air travel providers by putting additional seats in some of its planes in an attempt to boost revenue. According to the airline, seats will be added to its Boeing 737s and MD-80s, which make up roughly 60-percent of its entire fleet. Feeling the squeeze: American Airlines plans to put additional seats in some its planes in an attempt to boost revenue . 'Although we expect to add seats to the 737 and MD-80 fleets, we are . evaluating the right number of seats and the impact on revenue and cost . while retaining our Main Cabin Extra product,' the airline said in a . statement obtained by the Los Angeles Times. Currently, American Airlines' coach seats are 17 inches wide and offer roughly 28 inches of leg room. Those dimensions likely will have to change to fit the additional seats - as the price for consumers, of course, will likely stay the same, despite the tighter fit. By adding seats to its planes, American Airlines might also be forced to add additional flight attendants to each flight in order to meet the Federal Aviation Administration's requirement of one flight attendant per 50 seats. American Airlines executives Donald Carty (left) Michael Gunn demonstrate the current coach seating in American jet . Last year, the airline announced that it planned to instal 10 additional seats on its Boeing 777s in order to install lie-flat seats in business class. Those seats will begin to be added next year. In efforts to squeeze as much revenue out of each flight as possible, other airlines have started installing seats with thinner back cushions, which allows the airlines to put more seats in each cabin. It's unclear how many seats the airline - which is expected to merge with U.S. Airways in coming months after coming out of bankruptcy - will add to its planes.

Plea to his son: Lonnie Snowden, the father of NSA whistle blower Edward Snowden, holds up a picture of his son as a young boy as he begged him to return to the U.S. Lonnie Snowden told Fox & Friends: 'I’m here because I’m really . concerned about the misinformation in the media. He . is a sensitive, caring young man... He just is a deep thinker.' Mr Snowden said that his son was not a high school drop-out as has been reported but had missed several months of teaching because he was ill during his sophomore year. He completed his high school equivalency at a community college. Lonnie Snowden has other children and is keen to protect their identities following the scandal, he said. Mr Snowden senior also said that he is against any government surveillance program that snooped on its citizens emails and text messages. He said: 'In my opinion, they have no right. Not even under the guise of, ''We need to keep you safe.'' … Don’t tread on us.'

Underground: Snowden, 29, is currently hiding out in Hong Kong having leaked secrets about the National Security Agency's PRISM program . Shortly after Edward Snowden made the revelations, federal agents visited the Pennsylvania home of his father and stepmother. The 29-year-old is currently hiding out in Hong Kong having leaked secrets about the National Security Agency's PRISM program, which monitors millions of American citizens, to the media. His decision to reveal the national secrets have also left his girlfriend Lindsay Mills, 28, completely devastated.  Lindsay had previously written on her blog about how she was ‘adrift’ at losing Snowden who she described as her ‘mystery man’. Family members have said that Lindsay is currently with friends on the West Coast, though she could still be in Hawaii, where she and Snowden had been living together. He never told Mills about his plan - saying only that he needed to leave for a few weeks and offering a vague explanation. The shocking leak of classified surveillance programs has sent shock waves through the nation. Some have hailed Snowden as a hero. Several high-profile members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, are calling him a traitor, including former VP Dick Cheney. His whereabouts are currently unknown - though he is believed to still be in Hong Kong.

No need to move: Clarkson designed the P45 himself and tested the vehicle on the streets of Guildford . The one man mobility robot can pick-up . and drop off a passenger autonomously, while, in emergencies, . passengers can seize control of the vehicle using a joystick controller . in the cockpit. Originally . developed to help those who have difficulty walking - an increasing . number of people in Japan's ageing society - Ropits is designed to be . small enough to move through pedestrian spaces. Clarkson . unveiled the P45, designed by the presenter himself, in February on the . first episode of Top Gear's most recent series. Clarkson . tested the four-wheel vehicle on the streets of Guildford, hitting . 34mph at one stage as he weaved around traffic in the tiny vehicle. Look ma, no hands! But passengers can seize control of the vehicle using a joystick in an emergency . Tomorrow's world: Autonomous, single-user public transport has long been predicted for the future . Looking uncomfortable within the car's miniscule frame, Clarkson said: 'I’m just staggered that Ford, GM, Toyota, all of the automotive giants haven’t thought to make a car like this yet.' The Japanese robot is equipped with GPS to allow it to find its way, as well as laser distance sensors to look out for obstacles and a gyro sensor to help it stay upright while negotiating uneven ground. Passengers need only specify their desired destination on a touch-screen map and the machine will automatically drive them there. Similarly, anyone who needs a ride will be able to call a Ropits vehicle from any number of computer-networked 'stops' dotted around the city. The vehicle is also equipped with 'active suspension' which controls each wheel individually to enable it to tackle curbs and uneven ground while keeping passengers comfortably upright. Squeezed in: Clarkson hit a top speed of 34mph in the vehicle and was pictured overtaking static traffic, despite looking slightly uncomfortable . Lightweight: Passengers enter the Ropits vehicle by means of a front hatch . Unruffled: The system could be the perfect answer for Japan's busy corporate class of 'salary men'","Hitachi revealed the Robot for Personal Intelligent Transport System .

Six young footballers and one of their fathers have been jailed for beating a linesman to death as he officiated his son's junior match in the Netherlands. Richard Nieuwenhuizen, 41, from Buitenboys, died after being punched and kicked by players from opponents Nieuw Sloten on December 2 last year, apparently because they believed he had made a bad decision. A Dutch court convicted the seven people involved of manslaughter in the death of the volunteer linesman who was knocked to the ground and repeatedly kicked after a youth match last December in a brutal attack. Judges in Lelystad sentenced the . 50-year-old father to six years in prison. Five teenaged players were . given two-year sentences in youth detention for their roles in the . attack and another was sentenced to a year. Senseless: Richard Nieuwenhuizen, 41, from Buitenboys, died after he was punched and kicked by players from opponents Nieuw Sloten as he officiated his son's junior match (pictured with his son and daughter) A seventh player, age 15, was sentenced to 30 days detention for assault. All the defendants had insisted they . were innocent. They have two weeks to appeal. Their lawyers had argued . that the linesman, Richard Nieuwenhuizen, had an underlying medical . condition that contributed to his death but Dutch forensic experts said . he died as a result of the beating. Judges said the young players acted together in the fatal beating and gave them the highest sentences available. 'The seriousness of the event, the . lack of a clear reason for it, the terrible consequences, the fact that . they haven't accepted responsibility for their acts and the enormous . shock it caused throughout society and the entire football world meant . that the minors received the maximum possible sentence,' the court said . in a statement. Shocking: Richard Nieuwenhuizen was beaten to death during a Dutch amateur football match last year . Shock: Nieuwenhuizen, 41, was a volunteer linesman. His death sent shockwave through the Netherlands. Fans and players of both FC Twente and PSV Eindhoven held a minute silence in his honour after he died, right . The fatal attack took place on December 2 . in the Dutch city of Almere, after the home team Buitenboys drew 2-2 . with Nieuw Sloten, which is based in a mostly immigrant neighborhood of . Amsterdam. The 41-year-old Nieuwenhuizen was a volunteer linesman, officiating in a match that his son was playing in. He initially seemed to recover and shrugged off questions about whether he would file a complaint, but he later collapsed and died in hospital the following day. The Netherlands' National Forensics Institute concluded he was killed as a result of injuries sustained during the attack. In a statement, the court said the father sentenced to six years had received a heavy punishment because 'instead of setting a good example to the youths by criticizing their behavior he joined them in kicking and beating the linesman and has never accepted responsibility' for his actions. Verdict: Nieuwenhuizen's wife (pink shirt) leaves the courthouse in Lelystad on Monday . Nieuwenhuizen's death triggered a bout of soul-searching in Dutch football and beyond about the loss of respect for sports officials among youth players. 'You can't imagine it happening,' said Ajax coach Frank de Boer. 'That boys of 15, 16 years short circuit like that. You wonder about the parenting.' More than 12,000 people attended a silent march for Nieuwenhuizen in Almere on December 9. 'What can I do to teach today's football youth the difference between anger and aggression?' said Dutch football association chairman Michael van Praag at a ceremony afterwards. 'Football is emotion, but it's also winning and losing. You have to be able to do both, otherwise you don't fit in our sport.' Nieuwenhuizen's sons said Monday they hoped the convictions would send a message around the world that such attacks should not be tolerated in sport.

The trial of a man who allegedly murdered four prostitutes in the 1970s and 1990s began today with the grim details of the slayings being relayed for an emotional jury. Joseph Naso, who is now 79-years-old, is charged with the four murders and earned the horrifying 'double initial' nickname since the first names and last names of all four of the victims started with the same letter. His alleged victims were Roxene Roggasch, 18, was killed in 1977, 22-year-old Carmen Colon in 1978; 38-year-old Pamela Parsons in 1993; and 31-year-old Tracy Tafoya in 1994. Preparing for the grilling: Accused serial killer Joseph Naso, who is seen here with a legal adviser even though he will be representing himself in the trial, allegedly killed four prostitutes over three decades . Victims: In the prosecution's opening statement Monday, jurors were shown pictures of Naso's alleged victims. Clockwise from top left: Roxene Roggasch, 18, 22-year-old Carmen Colon, 38-year-old Pamela Parsons, and 31-year-old Tracy Tafoya . Naso, wearing a dark suit and spectacles instead of his usual jail clothes, watched the prosecutor's presentation to the jury on Monday with little reaction. He is representing himself and is expected to make his opening statement Monday afternoon. Prosecutors say Naso drugged and photographed his unconscious victims, then strangled them and dumped their naked bodies in rural areas. In one, a young woman had nylon stockings stuffed in her mouth and another pair tied around her neck. End game: Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Naso . Marin County prosecutor Rosemary Slote . also read from sections of a diary found at Naso's home that detailed . violent rapes of women. In a 1961 entry, the journal describes a man picking a girl up and raping her in a car in the Berkeley Hills. 'I pulled up her skirt and put it to her,' Slote said, reading from the journal. Trial: 79-year-old Joseph Naso is being tried for the murder of four women. Naso has plead not-guilty . Naso was arrested at the time on . suspicion of assault. Prosecutors say the woman named in that entry will . testify about the incident. Authorities around the country have also looked at Naso as a suspect in cold cases, but none have thus far come to light. Marin County prosecutors have built a significant case against Naso. Investigators . discovered DNA matching Naso's profile on at least one victim, . Roggasch, and a partial DNA match from material collected from under the . fingernails of Colon. Also discovered were photographs — including images of at least one of the victims in the case — and what prosecutors called a 'rape journal' during a search of Naso's Reno, Nevada, house. Naso characterized the sadistic photographs as his art and said all of his 'models' were willing participants. Near . the pile of photos in Naso's home — with mannequin parts and women's . lingerie strewn about — investigators said they also found a 'List of . 10' he had scrawled with descriptions of 10 women, including four . references prosecutors believe describe the slaying victims in this . case. Slote also said . she believed investigators had identified a fifth woman on the list: No. 8, 'Girl in Woodland (Nevada County).' Slot said she believed No. 8 is a . reference to a missing girl named Sara Dylan. Dylan's passport was found in Naso's safe deposit box, along with news clippings covering the slayings of Parsons and Tafoya, which Naso had laminated with photographs he had taken of each woman, and $152,400 in cash. Grim details: Amid most of the opening session on Monday, Naso remained emotionless spare this moment when he covered his eyes . Facing down: Judge Andrew Sweet (left) in Marin Superior court will oversee the trial of Naso . A skull found in Nevada County held DNA matching Dylan's mother's profile, Slote said. Naso is not charged with Dylan's murder, but the jury heard evidence about her case as prosecutors sought to tie Naso's list to more cold cases. There is no indication that any of the five other women referred to on the list have been identified, but prosecutors have said the investigation is ongoing.","79-year-old Joseph Naso is being tried on four counts of first-degree murder .

David Cameron will today try to launch talks on a free trade deal between Europe and the US that could be worth £380 a year for every British household. The Prime Minister wants to use this week's G8 summit in Northern Ireland to launch formal negotiations on an agreement that could be worth up to £10billion to the UK and £85billion worldwide. He will argue that a free trade deal – similar to that which operates inside the EU – would 'turbo-charge the transatlantic economy'. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron arrives at Belfast International Airport to attend the Enniskillen G8 summit where he wants to launch formal negotiations on an agreement with the U.S. 'These trade deals matter, because they mean more jobs, more choice for consumers and lower prices,' he said. Trade, tax and transparency were three vital drivers of growth that could produce 'transformative results', he said. Mr Cameron said he wanted 'a meeting where we can look each other in the eye' to solve the problems. But the most important issue is how to promote economic recovery, with action needed to boost growth, create jobs and reduce poverty, he added. 'Let's be clear, we still need to deal with fiscal deficits,' he said. 'Each country needs to press on with sorting out its public finances. Each country needs active monetary policy to kickstart the affordable loans and mortgages that businesses and families need. 'And each country needs to deal with the problem of youth unemployment by pursuing the structural reforms and flexible labour markets that are vital for competitiveness and jobs.'

France has urged for any trade agreement to include special protections for its film and TV industries against U.S. imports. There is also uncertainty over another of the Prime Minister's G8 priorities – an international deal to crack down on tax havens. Another key aim of the summit is a global deal on the payment of ransoms to terror groups who take hostages. Mr Cameron hopes it will 'choke off' a source of terror funding, given that some countries do still pay ransoms. 'It's an ambitious agenda.

A medical examiner who failed to inform police that the carbon monoxide gas that killed an elderly couple in their hotel bed could strike again, has resigned. Dr. Brent Hall, Watauga County Medical Examiner in North Carolina, had a medical report on his desk that explained the reasons for Daryl and Shirley Jenkins deaths, however their toxicology reports did not make it to Boone police until after an 11-year-old boy died in the exact same room two months later. Jeffrey Williams was found dead last week at the Best Western Plus Blue Ridge Plaza hotel. His mother was also found seriously ill. Resigned: Dr. Brent Hall, Watauga County Medical Examiner in North Carolina left his post suddenly on Friday. He has not spoken about the case or when he received the toxicology resutls . Poisoned by Carbon Monoxide: Jeffrey Williams, 11, was found dead in room 225 of the Best Western Hotel because of a faulty pool water heater . Just two months earlier, an elderly couple died in room 225, but it appears the state toxicology reports were never put at the top of a priority list. 'I don't know why they didn't expedite them, but the thinking at the time was that it was not carbon monoxide,' said Chief Police Officer Dana Crawford. Daryl and Shirley Jenkins died on April 16 and although the state completed its toxicology report proving carbon monoxide killed her on June 1st, the delay ended up becoming deadly. Police officers did not receive the results from the report for another ten days, but by then another person had died in the same room – 11-year-old Jeffrey Williams. Deadly delay: Boone police were not given the result from toxicology tests that revealed carbon monoxide was to blame for ten days. It meant guests were still staying in the room and Jeffrey Williams,11, lost his life as a result . Toxicology tests have confirmed that the deaths of Daryl Dean Jenkins, 73, and Shirley Mae Jenkins, 72, were both due to carbon monoxide poisoning . When Jeffrey and his mother checked into the hotel, they did not know about the previous victims — nor did the police. The state said Medical Examiner Dr. Brent Hall had received the toxicology report the week before Jeffrey Williams died, but Hall failed to share those results with Watauga County authorities who could have shut down the motel. Dr. Hall suddenly resigned on Friday, but he has not answered questions about when he received the results. Three people have died in the last couple of months after staying in room 225 at the Best Western Plus Blue Ridge Plaza in Boone, North Carolina . 'I can’t speculate as to why we . didn’t get them,' Police Chief Dana Crawford said, according to WSOC. Ms. Crawford said those documents could have saved Williams’ life. 'I would like to think we would have . been able to conclude and find the source of that carbon monoxide, and . with that information, been able to rectify that whole situation before . this happened,' Ms. Crawford said if her department knew . there was a carbon monoxide death in the room, they would have worked . with fire officials to find the leak. He said it took investigators just hours to trace it back to a pool water heater after Williams’ death.

A couple who met in a weight loss clinic waiting room went on to lose 37 stone between them - and fell madly in love. Jo Johnston and her boyfriend Shaun Palmer forged a close bond while supporting each other on their weight-loss journeys - and now they plan to marry. Jo, 32, went from 32 stone to 13 and Shaun from 38 stone to 21 following gastric surgery - losing the equivalent weight of a grizzly bear. Big slimmers: Super slimmer Jo Johnston and her boyfriend Shaun Palmer shed an . incredible 37 stone between them - after meeting in a weightloss waiting . room . How they were: After helping encourage each other in hospital, the pair swapped numbers, and two weeks later they met for their first date . Jo, from Aberystwyth, Wales, said: . 'We got chatting about our diets and hit it off immediately, it was like . we'd known each other for years. 'We both understood what the other was going through.' The pair were both patients at Luton and Dunstable Hospital in January 2011. And, seven months later, Jo was preparing for her operation when she noticed Shaun, 45, in the hospital bay next to hers. She said: 'I was nervous about the op, but Shaun had had his the day before, and he told me it would be OK.' After the operation, the pair lay side by side, separated only by a cardboard wall in the hospital bay, calling out messages of support to each other. When Shaun was discharged a day later, the pair swapped numbers, and two weeks later they met for their first date - a walk in the park and ice-cream - since neither could eat solid food. The romance flourished and just ten months later in November, Shaun proposed. Support: After their gastric band operations, the pair lay side by side, separated only by a cardboard wall in the hospital bay, calling out messages of support to each other and then fell in love . Jo, whose previous marriage broke down as she went through her treatment, said: 'Shaun is completely the other half of me, it was just meant to be. 'When I started my treatment I was married, but the relationship deteriorated as I went through it. My husband didn't understand but Shaun was always there offering support. 'Every time I went into hospital he was there. We had surgery a day apart and he was in the bay next to mine. It was fate.' Now the couple do everything together, from exercising, to introducing new foods into their diets, to buying new wardrobes. Her former self: When Jo was a size 34, she rarely left the house and even joined Weight Watchers aged 9- photo (R) shows her surgery scars . Jo, who first started going to Weight Watchers when she was just nine- years-old, said: 'I'm a size 16 now, I can't remember the last time I was that size. 'For the first time in ages I can go out to the High Street and buy clothes - it's brilliant.' When Jo was a size 34, she rarely left the house because the tops of her thighs rubbed together so much, they'd leave holes in her leggings after just two days. She said: 'I used to say ""the wheelie bin goes out more often than I do.""' Meanwhile Shaun, who had a heart attack at the age of just 25, used to wear 9XL clothes and drink up to 32 bottles of Smirnoff Ice each weekend. Jo, who is partially sighted and unemployed, said: 'He loves being able to buy clothes on the High Street too, because he used to have to order everything from America. Different people: Now the couple's diet had changed drastically, so have their appearances as they plan to wed . 'His waist has gone from 78 inches to 56 inches, and he's been able to buy his first pair of jeans. I'm starting to call him scrawny Shauny.' The couple even jokingly compete against one another in the weighing stakes - Jo has lost 20 stone and Shaun has lost 17. Jo said: 'We try to outdo each other and eat healthier foods for a bit of fun.' But Jo's diet wasn't always healthy. She fell in to comfort eating following three miscarriages in her previous relationship. Normal lives: Jo says Shaun loves being able to buy clothes on the High Street too, because he used to have to order everything from America . So in love: Jo says that her boyfriend 'understands her' after her previous relationship broke down because of her weight battle . Before seeking help for her weight problem she would skip breakfast and tucked into a Ginster's Pasty for lunch, followed by a chile con carne meal for four for dinner. After she would eat half a tub of ice-cream, a large chocolate bar, a cream egg, four packets of crisps, and four slices of bread with four eggs before bed, all washed down with an incredible six litres of coke. Now the couple's diet had changed drastically, so have their appearances. Jo said: 'Shaun gets more attractive every day, but of course he's still the same man inside. I'll love him though thick and thin.'

Royal baby: The arrival of the Duchess of Cambridge's baby, which is due next month, is expected to spark a spending boom . The nation will spend millions celebrating the arrival of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first child in July, experts have predicted. Britons are expected to spend £243million on memorabilia, champagne and food for parties. And the palace is likely to benefit from the birth - with a range of royal-themed baby clothes and gifts already available in its online shops. Guardsman sleepsuits for babies and princess t-shirts for girls are being sold on the Royal Collection Trust website for £12.95. There are also princess cushions for £45 and plastic dolls for £5.95. While Prince Charles's Highgrove shop is selling Union Flag and tractor-themed leather baby shoes for £22.50 and children's flatcaps for £40. The Buckingham Palace shop is planning to release an official range in honour of the baby, but not until after the birth. Money raised from the online shops is invested in maintaining the royal estates and art collections. High street chains will also cash in on the birth. Mothercare has announced a new range . of romper suits and baby grows and the chain is also planning a pram in . the design of a royal horse-drawn carriage. And Kate's parents' party accessories business Party Pieces has also launched a 'baby arrival' range. Retail experts say 4.8million people will spend £62million toasting the arrival of the Royal baby with three million bottles of champagne or sparkling wine. Around £25million will be spent on party food by those marking the occasion. The public will spend £56million on commemorative memorabilia, £76million on books, DVDs and media and £24million on toys at the time of the birth. And the 'Kate effect' which has seen dresses worn by the Duchess to fly off the shelves is likely to inspire parents to splash out on the pram or pushchair she buys - rumoured to be a blue Bugaboo - causing sales to increase by 13 per cent. Royal events have traditionally led to sales boosts, with the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge causing sales to rise by 6.9 per cent compared to the previous year and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee seeing spending up 3.5 per cent, according to the KPMG monitor. Expecting: The Duchess makes a joke with Camilla and Harry during her last public appearance before the birth . The 'Kate effect': High street items worn by the Duchess sell out within hours of her being pictured in them . Shopping: The Duchess has been spotted browsing for nursery supplies. It is expected parents will copy her style and snap up the same baby equipment . Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of . the Centre for Retail Research, said: 'It is no great surprise that this type of . feel good event provides retailers with a welcome boost as consumer . hype generates additional spending. 'However, much of this can be . attributed to retailers increased marketing and advertising activity . around the time of the event, quite rightly securing their share of the . spending frenzy. 'These are difficult times for retailers and every . catalyst for increased sales should be utilised as this will bring the . economic recovery one step closer.' Baby range: The Royal Collection Trust is selling royal-themed children's clothes including this guardsman sleeper suit (left) and pink princess t-shirt (right), both at £12.95 .

Collectables: The Royal Collection Trust shop sells this plastic princess doll (left) for £5.95, while Prince Charles's Highgrove gift shop sells Union Flag leather baby shoes for £22.50 .

"By . Leon Watson . PUBLISHED: . 16:03 EST, 17 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:52 EST, 17 June 2013 . A village cricket club has been hit for six after health and safety officials told it to stop using hard balls on its pitch during batting practice. Bacton Cricket Club in Norfolk has been told that it can only use proper cricket balls for practice inside the cricket nets and not on the field as it has done for 37 years. The new health and safety ruling has been drawn up Bacton parish council because of fears that members of the public could be hit and injured by stray balls. Bowled out: Club members, left to right, Scott Cain, Kurtis Gale, 18, Ramone Stringer and Josh Cain, 13 . But club officials have refused to agree to the new set of rules, governing the use of the Cubitt Memorial Playing Field in Bacton. Club chairman David Gale said talks were now in place to move the team away from the village to a new base at nearby North Walsham High School. He said: 'We are a cricket team - how are we supposed to practice without cricket balls? Are they expecting us to use tennis balls instead? 'It's upsetting - I've spent 10 summers nurturing the cricket square and you can really bat on it. The rules are untenable.' Mr Gale said it was common for batsmen and bowlers at any club to practise outside of the nets, adding that the nets at the ground were of a poor quality. The move will mean that club cricket will no longer be played in the village and the name of Bacton Cricket Club, established in 1934, will disappear. Bacton Cricket Club in Norfolk has been told that it can only use proper cricket balls for practice inside the cricket nets . 'It's a sorry saga, and this is something . that the council really did not want to do. But they have to come to . the table and adhere to the rules.' Council clerk Elaine Pugh . The club which plays in the Norfolk Cricket League Division Six is now set to rename itself North Walsham Cricket Club. The parish council is refusing to back down even though villagers have signed a petition in support of the cricket club. The new rules for the use of the field state: 'Batting or bowling practice with a cricket ball or other solid or semi-solid practice ball must only take place inside the batting cage [nets]. Under no circumstances may this take place elsewhere.' Council clerk Elaine Pugh said the rule was included in a complete set of new ground regulations to satisfy insurers' demands and protect people at the nearby bowls club, children on the play area and young people who also used the facilities during the week. She said the rules were being enforced to 'protect the public' as there had been a couple of recent 'near misses' in which other people on the field had almost been hit by cricket balls. Mrs Pugh said the council had other issues with the club including a mobile scoring hut being used without permission and concern about individuals being 'aggressive' at council meetings. But she added: 'It's not a done and dusted deal. They can come and sit at the table and be polite and we can go forward from there.' Mrs Pugh said the club has been written to at least 12 times, requesting information that they had to comply with and confirmation that they would agree to the rules. She said: 'It's a sorry saga, and this is something that the council really did not want to do. But they have to come to the table and adhere to the rules.' The council agreed last week that the cricket club's behaviour was 'unacceptable' and banned it from the field for the rest of the season. But it agreed that the ruling could be reversed if to complied with the regulations. Bacton Cricket Club honorary treasurer Ramone Stringer said: 'The parish council kept coming up with rules and regulations. 'This has been bubbling up for a long while. They wanted all our players to sign the rules and regulations, but they weren't happy. 'They said they didn't have the fixtures in time, and that the insurance details weren't up in the pavilion.' 'It's very sad for Bacton, which should always have a cricket club. But we're 99.9pc certain to move to North Walsham High School and change our name. 'The move will probably pay off, because North Walsham should have a cricket club and it will attract youngsters to play.'","Bacton Cricket Club in Norfolk is caught in health and safety row .
