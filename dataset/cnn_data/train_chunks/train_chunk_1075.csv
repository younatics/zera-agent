"A Muslim convict found with an ISIS flag at a jail on the Isle of Wight plotted to take a prison officer hostage and make a violent escape. The inmate, who is believed to have become radicalised inside the Parkhurst site, was found with detailed plans of the jail. An internal prison service security bulletin said the convict had been moved into isolation immediately after the discovery. The convict at a prison on the Isle of Wight was found with a home-made ISIS flag (file picture) and was plotting to kidnap a prison officer in a bid to make an escape . The weekly bulletin of the National Offender Management Service, seen by the BBC, says that 'acting on intelligence a prisoner's cell was searched. 'Detailed escape plans involving taking a member of staff hostage were discovered.' The report adds that movement at the prison was restricted 'whilst the accommodation and his associates were searched'. The inmate had drawn a black ISIS flag on a piece of material in his cell at the Category B prison, it is understood. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: 'Vigilant staff found a very basic description of the inside of the prison during a cell search at HMP Isle of Wight. 'This clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of our robust security measures. The prisoner is now in segregation.' The inmate at the Parkhurst site of Isle of Wight Prison was found with plans of the inside of the jail . The Sunday People reported that the plotter was not known to the security services and that the man had only recently converted to Islam. Previous prison officer kidnap plots, such as one at Belmarsh in 2010, have involved plans to behead the hostage. However, it is thought that the Parkhurst plan was an attempt to escape, rather than to harm. The Home Office said it would not comment on individual cases. Isle of Wight prison was formed in 2009 as a merger of the Parkhurst and Albany sites.","Inmate at Parkhurst Prison was found with a black ISIS flag in his cell .

"A 10-year-old boy charged with fatally beating a 90-year-old woman remained in adult prison on Wednesday after his lawyer withdrew a request for bail, saying his family isn't ready to have him released into their custody. Tristen Kurilla, 10, who is charged as an adult with criminal homicide for the murder of 90-year-old Helen Novak over the weekend, appeared via a video hookup for a hearing, burying his face in his hands at times but not speaking. The boy's mother, Martha Virbitsky, believes he is being treated well at the county prison, where he is being housed alone in a cell and being kept away from the general population, said his attorney, Bernard Brown. No bail: Tristen Kurilla's  lawyer withdrew a request for bail, saying his family isn't ready to have him released into their custody and that they believe he is being treated well in county prison . Not ready: Tristen Kurilla's mother Martha Virbitsky says she is not ready to have Tristen back in her care but she did not elaborate on the reasons why . He said the boy was being provided recreational opportunities and coloring books. Brown had filed a petition to have the boy released into the custody of his father or moved to a juvenile detention facility. But he said the family was not comfortable having him placed in their care right now. He didn't elaborate on the reasons. The closest juvenile detention center is 80 miles away, which would make family visits inconvenient, Brown said. Judge Raymond Hamill said he was also concerned about moving the boy to a juvenile center and exposing him to 'elements more detrimental to his well-being.' The attorney still plans to seek to have the case transferred to juvenile court. The boy is among the youngest charged with homicide in Pennsylvania, a list that includes two 11-year-olds and a 9-year-old, said Marsha Levick, chief counsel of the Juvenile Law Center in Philadelphia. Adult charges: Prosecutors  said that they had no choice but to charge Tristen Kurilla as an adult because in Pennsylvania homicide charges must be filed in an adult court . Levick said the case belongs in juvenile court, calling it a 'no-brainer.' 'He's a little boy,' she said. 'It's a horrible tragedy, but it's shocking that he suddenly turned into an adult because of conduct that he engaged in.' Prosecutors had said that they had no choice but to charge him as an adult. In Pennsylvania, homicide charges must be filed in adult court. Judges can then move the cases to juvenile court when deemed appropriate. District Attorney Janine Edwards said she will wait for the results of a mental health evaluation before deciding whether to contest having the case moved to juvenile court. The beating Saturday occurred at the home of the boy's grandfather, who had been caring for the woman, Helen Novak. According to the boy's mother, her son said he lost his temper when he went into the woman's room to ask her a question and she yelled at him. Authorities said the boy briefly held Novak down with a cane and then punched her in the throat and stomach. The boy told a state trooper that he was 'only trying to hurt her,' but also acknowledged, 'killed that lady,' according to the arrest affidavit. Anger issues:  The boy, who had been having some mental issues, told a state trooper that he was 'only trying to hurt her,' but also acknowledged, 'killed that lady,'when referring to Helen Novak .","Tristen Kurilla, 10, charged with fatally beating a 90-year-old Helen Novack on Saturday remained in adult prison on Wednesday .

"Despair: Support for Ed Miliband has slumped as today he is attacked by left-wing magazine the New Statesman as an 'old-style Hampstead socialist' Ed Miliband is today attacked as an ‘old-style Hampstead socialist’ and a ‘quasi Marxist’ by the house journal of the Left amid evidence that Labour is losing even its ‘core vote’ which backed Gordon Brown in 2010. It comes as a new analysis shows Labour’s support has slumped by between eight and ten percentage points over the last 18 months, prompting mounting alarm among its MPs about the prospects of election victory. And last night there were rumours swirling at Westminster that a letter calling on Mr Miliband to go was being prepared by some Labour MPs. One source said the move was being seriously considered amid despair at his leadership, though the plot is unlikely to take off with the general election only months away and little agreement among Labour critics over who should replace Mr Miliband. In another blow to the Labour leader, former Cabinet minister Alan Milburn said the party needed more ‘realism’ over the state of the public finances and poured scorn on the idea it could pay for its plans simply by raising taxes on the wealthy. Today, in a scathing editorial, the New Statesman, which is traditionally supportive of Labour, warns that Mr Miliband’s approach is haemorrhaging support on the Left to the Greens and the Scottish National Party. The magazine says the Labour leader appears a product of his ‘narrow background’ and demonstrates no understanding of lower middle-class aspiration. Jason Cowley, editor of the New Statesman, one of only two national publications to back Mr Miliband over his brother David for the Labour leadership in 2010, said he appeared ‘very much an old-style Hampstead socialist’. ‘He doesn’t really understand the lower middle-class or material aspiration,’ he writes. ‘He doesn’t understand Essex Man or Woman. Politics for him must seem at times like an extended PPE seminar: elevated talk about political economy and the good society.’ He adds: ‘Miliband has a deterministic, quasi-Marxist analysis of our present ill. The Ukip insurgency, Scottish nationalism, the hollowing out of political parties, Islamist radicalisation, the loathing and distrust of elites: all are manifestations of a failed economic model.’ Alan Milburn, left, with Charles Clarke: Former Cabinet minister Mr Milburn said Labour needed more ‘realism’ over the state of the public finances and poured scorn on plans to raise taxes on the wealthy . According to a devastating analysis by the Left-wing Fabian Society, there has now been a fall in support among the party’s 2010 voters of four percentage points. Its general secretary, Andrew Harrop, said: ‘A drop like this was meant to be impossible. All through the parliament, the Labour hierarchy assumed that anyone who voted Brown in 2010 would surely stick in 2015. Well it turns out you can’t take anyone for granted.’ Labour has only a fragile lead in a string of key marginal seats which will be wiped out if Ukip voters can be won over by the Conservatives, a poll indicated yesterday. The latest survey of Tory/Labour battlegrounds by pollster Lord Ashcroft confirmed that, by splitting the Tory vote, Ukip is on course to hand a general election victory to Ed Miliband. However, Labour’s lead in the constituencies was slender, suggesting there is all to play for in next year’s election. The poll indicated the Tory message of ‘vote Farage, get Miliband’ could be effective. Lord Ashcroft said increasing numbers of voters were backing Mr Cameron as their preferred prime minister. Overall, 30 per cent were satisfied with his performance, and 29 per cent said they were dissatisfied but still preferred him to Mr Miliband. Extraordinarily, 30 per cent of Labour voters said they wanted Mr Cameron to remain in Downing Street. Just 34 per cent of Ukip voters want to see Labour in government, the poll found. Some 78 per cent of those who have currently switched from the Conservatives to Ukip want the Tories in government. Lord Ashcroft said: ‘The Tories can afford to lose no more than 21 seats to Labour if they are to remain the largest party.’ But Mr Harrop said Labour still remained best placed to win next May because of the split in the Right-wing vote caused by Ukip. One senior MP suggested that Mr Miliband should abandon Westminster, apart from for Prime Minister’s Questions, and go on a tour of the country to try to revive his faltering leadership – a tactic adopted in the 1980s by then Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown. But the MP doubted that the Labour leader had the will to do so, concluding: ‘His confidence has gone. It’s like a light’s gone out.’ A Shadow Cabinet minister said: ‘Morale has never been lower … We’re all very, very concerned. The reality is that whilst we don’t have a presidential system, people are thinking increasingly about who they want to be the prime minister.’ Former Cabinet minister Alan Milburn was critical of Labour’s plans to reintroduce Gordon Brown’s short-lived 50p top rate of tax if it regains power next year. Mr Milburn, the party’s election co-ordinator at the 2005 election, said the 50p tax rate would be ‘absolutely incidental, by the way, to the state of the public finances’, adding: ‘Let’s not kid ourselves.’ In a recording of an event at Labour’s annual conference, he said big spending plans would not be possible ‘in the bad times’. ‘So all I’m saying to you as fellow party members is that we need a note of realism and we need a note of edge as we go into the next general election,’ he added. An abridged version of New Statesman editor Jason Cowley's withering analysis of Ed Miliband . Miliband is very much an old-style Hampstead socialist. He doesn’t really understand the lower middle class or material aspiration. He doesn’t understand Essex Man or Woman. Politics for him must seem at times like an extended PPE seminar: elevated talk about political economy and the good society. At present, he and Labour seem trapped. His MPs sense it and the polls reflect it. Ukip is attracting support in the party’s old working-class northern English heartlands and winning converts in key Home Counties swing seats that Labour would once have hoped to win. In Scotland the SNP has become the natural party of government. Miliband is losing the support of the Left (to the SNP, to the Greens) without having formed a broader coalition of a kind that defined the early Blair-Brown years. Most damaging, I think, is that he seldom seems optimistic about the country he wishes to lead. Miliband speaks too often of struggle and failure, of people as victims – and it’s true that life is difficult for many. But a . nation also wants to feel good about itself and to know in which direction it is moving. Miliband does not have a compelling personal story to tell the electorate, as Thatcher did about her remarkable journey from the grocer’s shop in Grantham and the values that sustained her along the way or Alan Johnson does about his rise from an impoverished childhood in west London. “I went to Oxford to study PPE, worked for Gordon Brown, became a Cabinet minister and then leader of the party” does not quite do it. None of this would matter were Miliband in manner and approach not so much the product of this narrow background. Miliband’s chief problem is not policy but tone. He needs to find a distinctive voice to articulate people’s feelings about the present moment. And he might have to accept before long – or the electorate will force him to – that Europe’ s social-democratic moment, if it ever existed, is fading into the past. Ed's poll guru parachutes in . Guru: Lucy Powell was parachuted into the shadow Cabinet last night in an attempt to turn around the party’s faltering efforts to win next year’s election . The MP who ran Ed Miliband’s Labour leadership campaign was parachuted into the shadow Cabinet last night in an attempt to turn around the party’s faltering efforts to win next year’s election. In what appeared to be a snub to shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander, who is in charge of the campaign, Lucy Powell was brought in to a new position as his ‘vice chair’ and shadow Cabinet Office minister. Labour officials said she would take ‘day-to-day control’, while Mr Alexander would continue to be responsible for ‘strategy’. The reshuffle was prompted by the resignation of shadow international development secretary Jim Murphy, who is bidding to lead the party in Scotland. To the surprise of Westminster observers, who rate her as one of the more effective Labour frontbenchers, Mary Creagh was demoted from shadow transport secretary to replace Mr Murphy. Her transport brief went to Michael Dugher, a former spin doctor for Gordon Brown who was shadow Cabinet Office minister. Labour said David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Barack Obama hired at great expense by Labour to advise on the election campaign, will be visiting the UK shortly to shore up Mr Miliband. There has been growing sniping about Mr Axelrod’s role, since he did not attend Labour’s annual conference in September and is rumoured to have become disillusioned about his advice being ignored.","Withering analysis comes amid evidence Labour is losing its 'core vote'

"David and Samantha Cameron are looking at a number of state secondary schools for their children . David Cameron and wife Samantha are considering one of London’s best all-girls state secondary schools for daughter Nancy, insisting no one should feel the need to pay for private education. The Prime Minister, who had a privileged schooling at Eton College, confirmed he is set to become the first Conservative prime minister to send a child to a state secondary. ‘We want to, I have always said that. We have been round three or four schools in London and had a good look,’ he said. ‘My daughter has got a very large say in the matter so she is having a think about what she has seen. But there are some good schools to go to.’ The Camerons are understood to have visited Lady Margaret School, an academy in Fulham, west London, which is rated ‘outstanding’ by education watchdog Ofsted. A Church of England school, its former pupils include journalist Janet Street Porter, film director Martha Fiennes and actress Kelly Hunter. It is heavily oversubscribed, with 67 places each year reserved for girls whose parents have attended services at a Church of England church at least fortnightly for a minimum of three years. The other 53 are given to girls of any or no religion. The school, around four miles from Downing Street, also uses ‘banding’ by ability to ensure its intake is genuinely comprehensive, with a quarter of girls taken each year being of above average ability, half average and a quarter below average. The Camerons have sent their children to a nearby Church state primary school in Kensington, which also reserves places for families who are regular churchgoers. The Prime Minister once described his Christian faith as being a ‘bit like the reception for Magic FM in the Chilterns: it sort of comes and goes’. But more recently, he praised the contribution that Christians make to society, referred to Jesus as ‘our saviour’ and spoke of the ‘moments of greatest peace’ that he has experienced attending the Eucharist. Friends say that Mr Cameron has always had a quiet but profound faith that helped him come to terms with the death of his eldest son Ivan. Among schools thought to have been visited by the Camerons is Lady Margaret School in Fulham, west London (pictured) Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha have looked at the Holland Park school in West London - one of the first comprehensives in the UK . Other schools the Camerons are understood to have looked at for 10-year-old Nancy to attend next September include The Grey Coat Hospital Church of England School, an all-girls comprehensive three-quarters of a mile from Downing Street. The Government’s chief whip and former Education Secretary Michael Gove has sent his daughter Beatrice, who attended the same primary as the Cameron children, to the school. Mr Cameron and his wife have also visited Holland Park School – one of the first comprehensives in the UK, where Labour grandees such as the late Tony Benn sent their children. Both schools are described as 'ethnically diverse' and have intakes from some of London's most deprived areas. Mrs Cameron - who was educated at private Marlborough College – is said to have told friends she is keen for Nancy to have a 'normal education'. In an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine, the Prime Minister suggested the Government’s education reforms were designed to make private education redundant. ‘If you pay your taxes you shouldn't have to pay all over again. There is no reason why our state schools can't be among the best in the world, and some of them are,’ he said. ‘What is exciting is there this change not only in practice but also in culture which is all about excellence and wanting to be the best and wanting to get the best out of every child, and you are now seeing that in more and more schools. ‘It’s about early intervention, intolerance of failure and getting stuck in. We know what works now; it is changing the leadership, changing the curriculum, better discipline, uniforms. We can have quite a quick effect. The Camerons have looked at The Grey Coat Hospital Church of England School for their 10-year-old daughter Nancy - the school chosen by the former Education Secretary Michael Gove (right) for his daughter Beatrice. Mr Cameron have also visited Holland Park School – where Labour's Hilary Benn was sent . The state schools under consideration  are a far cry from the establishments attended by Mr Cameron and his wife. The Prime Minister went to Eton (above) - the most exclusive school in the country . ‘The proof of the pudding is that since 2010 there are a quarter of a million fewer children in failing schools – that is quite a lot of schools. This is recognising that in some areas schools slide into failure and not enough happens quickly enough and that is where the regional schools commissioners who tend to be former expert head teachers can get stuck in. ‘There are endless debates about how you arrange admissions. Should we have lotteries? Should we have selections? In the end, the answer to all these questions is let’s have more good schools. We are introducing more good schools and more good school places through school turnarounds, academies, the free schools. We need that to go further and faster.’ The Prime Minister rejected the suggestion that the Government’s exam reforms, which mean less emphasis in coursework, meant less academic children would lose out. ‘I don’t agree with that. I think all children will benefit because I think all children deserve to have the fundamentals of a good education. I simply do not accept there are some children who can’t get a good qualification in English or Maths,’ he said. 'I say to my own children “there isn’t a job in the world where you don’t need a qualification in English or Maths”. My son said “what about being a footballer?” I said “you still have to read the contract and count the money”.' Samantha Cameron attended Marlborough College in Wiltshire - a private boarding school for girls and boys . Asked how often he sits down with his children and does homework with them, Mr Cameron said: ‘In a week I will do some help, but Samantha plays the leading part, I will admit. 'This morning, I was trying to get one to do guitar practise in one room and the other to do touch typing in the other. They were running me ragged because they know that when I am in charge it is not quite so well organised. ‘I got there in the end, various threats were … Screen time [on tablets] in the Cameron household is severely rationed to try and deliver the effect of homework, but it doesn’t always work.’ Mr Cameron said he was most inspired at school by Michael Kidson, one of his history teachers, now 84. ‘He was brilliant but used teaching methods that you would not necessarily get away with now. He had a wooden block on his desk and if you weren’t concentrating he would fling it across the room at you,’ the Prime Minister said. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan told the magazine she had also chosen a state primary for her son. 'I think you have more good and outstanding [state] schools. The choice is there. My son is at a good, local village school and there was really no question that was where he went after nursery,’ she said. A Number Ten spokesman said: 'As with other parents at this time of year, the Prime Minister and Mrs Cameron are looking at various schools for their daughter to go to next September.'","The Prime Minister is looking at secondary schools for daughter Nancy .

"A friend of Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev got some unlikely help in federal court today when former presidential candidate Michael Dukakis showed up to testify on his behalf. Dukakis took the stand  for Robel Phillipos, telling jurors about a conversation he had with Phillipos five days after the deadly bombing. The politician described himself as a longtime family friend of Phillipos and his mother, saying his wife, Kitty Dukakis, had worked as a social worker with Phillipos' mother, and the two families remained friends. Scroll down for videos . On the case: Former presidential candidate Michael Dukakis (above) appeared in federal court in Boston today to testify on behalf of Robel Phillipos . In trouble: Phillipos (above), a friend of Boston bombing suspect  Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is on trial for lying to the FBI in the days after the bombing . Suspects: Dzhokhar (left) and his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev (right), who is now deceased, are believed to have carried out the 2013 bombing in Boston during the city's annual marathon . Phillipos, 20, is charged with lying to authorities about his movements three days after the April 15, 2013, attack that killed three people and injured more than 260. Dukakis said Phillipos' mother called him on April 20, 2013, and said she was worried because she hadn't heard from her son for two days. Dukakis said he asked for Phillipos' cellphone number, then called him. 'He told me he had been questioned for five hours by the FBI,' Dukakis said. 'He told me he was so confused he didn't know what he said.' The spectacle of a well-known politician testifying at the trial was not lost on jurors, who listened attentively as Dukakis briefly described his political career and his conversation with Phillipos. Dukakis, 80, said he first met Phillipos when the defendant was about 4 or 5 years old. He said Phillipos came to his home over the years and he took him to the Democratic National Convention in 2004, when Phillipos was 10. 'We've certainly watched him grow up,' Dukakis said. Phillipos wiped away tears with a tissue as Dukakis described their long relationship. Dukakis told reporters that during their conversation, he urged Phillipos to contact his mother. 'I said, ""Well, call your mother, will you? She's very concerned.""' Upstanding guy: Dukakis said Phillipos is a good kid and was just confused after being forced to answer questions for hours for the FBI . Bad choice: Phillipos was in a room with two other individuals as they destroyed evidence vital to the investigation of the bombing . Prosecutors say Phillipos lied about being in Tsarnaev's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth when two other friends removed Tsarnaev's backpack and other potential evidence just hours after the FBI released photos of Tsarnaev and his brother as suspects. At the time, an intense manhunt was underway to find the Tsarnaevs. Dukakis' testimony appeared to be designed to support the defense contention that Phillipos was a frightened and confused 19-year-old when he was questioned by the FBI and did not intentionally mislead investigators. The defense also says that Phillipos was so high on marijuana that he couldn't clearly remember what he did the night of April 18, 2013, when the two other men removed Tsarnaev's backpack. Under cross-examination by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Capin, Dukakis acknowledged that he has no personal knowledge about what Phillipos told the FBI when he was interviewed. Capin asked Dukakis if Phillipos had told him that he had lied to federal agents about what he saw happen in Tsarnaev's dorm room, if he would have advised him to contact the FBI. 'If he had told me that, sure, but he didn't,' Dukakis said. Helping hand: Dukais and his wife Kitty (above) are family friends with Phillipos and his mother . Past glory: Dukakis, who is the cousin of actress Olympia Dukakis (above) was the Democratic candidate for president in 1988 . Phillipos attended high school in Cambridge with Tsarnaev and later attended UMass-Dartmouth with him. Prosecutors say he told a string of lies to the FBI during several interviews until he finally confessed to being in Tsarnaev's dorm room and seeing the two friends take Tsarnaev's backpack, which contained fireworks that had been emptied of their explosive powder. The backpack was later recovered in a landfill. The other two men were convicted of conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Dukakis told reporters he was comfortable testifying for Phillipos. 'All I know is ... you've got testimony that's relevant in the case — I don't care who the defendant is — you've got the responsibility to ... provide that testimony,' he said. Dukakis had two stints as Massachusetts governor, from 1975 to 1979 and 1983 to 1991. He was the Democratic nominee for president in 1988, losing to Republican George H.W. Bush. He is also the cousin of Academy Award-winning actress Olympia Dukakis.","Former presidential candidate Michael Dukakis testified on behalf of Robel Phillipos in a federal court in Boston today .

The average bag in 2014 weighs in at an average 5.4lbs, filled with all its contents . A new survey polled 3,000 British women reminiscing on their handbag of the 90s compared to the essentials of today. Results show over the past 20 years the contents of the average woman's handbag has evolved beyond recognition. Our lives are now typically run by simply six essential tech items, meaning the average woman is now walking around with £1,095 on her arm. Despite technology streamlining our everyday essentials from 14 items in 1994 to just 6 key pieces today, women insist on carrying round the 'just in case' items despite never needing to use them. An overwhelming 73 per cent carry 10 or more items of so-called junk in their handbags. More than half (56 per cent) of those carry spare shoes, and 36 per cent carrying around spare underwear. Yet only 23 per cent say they use these items on a regular basis. Nine in ten women admit they carry more than ten items of junk in their handbags . A typical 1990s bag and all its contents (l) and the tote of the modern woman and its essentials (r) The research highlighted the increasing dependence on technology, with 86 per cent of women relying solely on card payments, and not ever carrying cash. A further 94 per cent of women say they don't own an A-Z, instead depending on their phone's navigation app to get around. This is in stark contrast to women of the 90s who counted their A-Z as the most important item in their handbag after their Filofax and cash. The smartphone ranked as the single most important item carried on a daily basis, above even cards and keys, compared with women of the 90's who did not view a mobile phone as being an everyday essential at all. Other items now obsolete include cheque  books, music players and books. They have been replaced with credit cards, phones and e-readers. The popularity of e-cigarettes, which provide an alternative to smoking, are replacing the cigarettes and lighter' combo as a handbag essential. However several items have stood the test of time with painkillers, make-up and chewing gum all retaining spots in the top ten. But expensive necessities such as tablets and smartphones, have seen the average cost of a handbag's contents rise to a staggering average £1,095, with women in their 20s typically hauling thousands of pounds worth of gadgets around with them. A spokesperson for e-cigarette brand Vapestick, which conducted the research, said: 'Technology has had a huge affect on what we all carry around with us these days, and has helped improve almost every aspect of our everyday lives. 'It will be interesting to see how technological developments will change the contents of a typical handbag again over the next twenty years.' Empty your bag out and chuck out any rubbish . Make technology work harder for you . We all now have phones that do a million and one things so use the features and ditch the notebook, the map, the camera - and download a book app so you don't need to carry a kindle. Use a makeup bag . Keep all those rogue lipsticks from rolling around in your bag. If it's broken, throw it away . We all love to keep a great eyeshadow palette that's now cracked and leaking but it can soon make a mess of your handbag. Use up small change . It accumulates in the bottom of your bag and ends up weighing a tonne. Only carry what you need that day . It sounds simple but we end up carting around shoes, notebooks, books we never read - keep it light and give your back a break. A place for everything and everything in it's place . We live life at a hundred miles an hour and end up chucking everything into the bottomless pit we call a handbag. Use the side pockets to keep what you need regularly on hand. Swap bulky items for streamlined ones . Instead of carrying a whole makeup palette invest in handbag eyeshadow - and refill those sample size foundation bottles. Re-evaluate . Empty your bag out every weekend and decide what you really need and what you don't - and chuck out any rubbish. Those receipts and train tickets soon mount up.","British women's handbags weigh more than a small dog .

"A Democrat candidate in Arkansas has admitted to moonlighting as a male stripper in the past who source claimed went under the name 'Metro Express'. John Burkhalter, who is vying to become lieutenant-governor in Little Rock, said he took on the gig while he was also buying cows for 17 acres of land he owned and was trying to make ends meet. The married father-of-two daughters admitted in an interview last week that he had used his athletic physique to turn his hand to exotic dancing. Scroll down for video . Magic Mike? Democrat candidate for Arkansas's Lieutenant-Governor John Burkhalter, pictured at a food festival in August, revealed in an interview last week that he used to be a male stripper . Burkhalter, pictured left with his wife Penny at a charity ball in September along with other guests. He is hoping to become the next lieutenant-governor for the state of Arkansas . He told 5News: 'I’ve always been an athlete, and I was actually buying cows from a farm.' On an online chatroom called Old Chippendales, one user called 'very married', wrote: 'John was once a major body-builder and moonlighted as a male stripper in so-called straight strip joints in a low-end southern Chippendale style circuit. 'He wore white tuxes with tails and handed out long stem roses to ladies, then took everything off.' His stripper name used to be Metro Express, according to one commenter on the Arkansas Times. MailOnline did not receive a comment today from Mr Burkhalter's campaign. Rumors about the Democrat's stripper job first emerged when an automated call which referenced his past was placed to the homes of Arkansas residents last year. Mr Burkhalter graduated from the University of Arkansas with a degree in civil engineering in 1980. He grew his small firm into a company across 27 states with hundreds of employees. He has made no secret about his hard-working past saying that he had jobs hauling railroad ties from box cars, cleaning theaters and working in chicken plants. The politician and his wife, Penny, have two young daughters. Mr Burkhalter is up against Republican U.S. Representative Tim Griffin for the Arkansas lieutenant governor's office. The two are vying to become the state's No. 2 leader along with Libertarian Chris Olson. The office has been unoccupied since Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Darr stepped down in February amid an ethics investigation. The politician pictured on the campaign trail earlier this year with his wife and daughters.

"People in five areas of the UK will now have to dial the full area code to telephone local homes and businesses – as regulators claim we are running out of landline numbers. The change, which came into effect on Wednesday, covers Aberdeen (01224), Bradford (01274), Brighton (01273), Middlesbrough (01642) and Milton Keynes (01908). It means that people calling a local number must also include the area code when dialling – just as if they were using a mobile phone. Scroll down for video . People in five areas of the UK will now have to dial the full area code to telephone homes and businesses . And if they forget, they will hear a recorded message asking them to include it. The move, implemented by the telecoms watchdog Ofcom, is designed to create nearly one million new numbers for these locations. An Ofcom spokesman said the move is necessary to prevent the country running out of numbers, and that the changes can be adopted easily. Call costs will not be affected. Ofcom is also planning to implement the same system in Oxford, Slough and Stoke-on-Trent from some point after 2016 with contingency plans in place for a further 20 cities to follow suit. Among the many other locations under the spotlight are Swindon, Hull, York, Norwich, Guildford, Warwick Bath and Motherwell. The industry regulator insists the shift is necessary to prevent the country running out of numbers, however research by the organisation suggests the public are sceptical about this claim. The shift in telephone use towards mobile phones and calls made over the internet through services such as Skype suggests the demand for new landline numbers should be falling. There is also some resistance to the fact that the change means people will need to dial an 11 digit number to reach a local take-away or family member. Separately, it creates extra costs for small businesses and traders, who need to change letter heads and signs to show the full number, including the national code. Brighton, above, is just one of five areas that will see a change in how people call local numbers . Currently, Ofcom cannot allocate local phone numbers where the first digit is 0 or 1. This is because the network computers may confuse the number with other existing dialling codes or with a number reserved for special use. For example, the system would recognise 07 as a mobile number, 08 as a special rate, or 118 as directory enquiries. Once consumers are required to use the national code, thousands of new numbers beginning 0 or 1 can be offered to families or businesses. Ofcom insisted the changes can be adopted without too much inconvenience. It gives the example of Bournemouth, which adopted the new system in 2012. The number of communications providers has increased significantly over the last ten years, leading to more competition and cheaper landline bills for millions of homes and businesses. But it has also led to increased pressure on the supply of new phone numbers. A spokesman said: ‘Requiring landline callers to use the code locally is intended to safeguard the future supply of new landline numbers and avoid the need for more disruptive measures, such as changing existing phone numbers. ‘The supply of new landline numbers also ensures that consumers and businesses continue to enjoy the widest choice of telecoms providers. ‘The cost of calls will not be affected, and those who dial without the area code after the change will hear a recorded message asking them to include it. ‘The measure was first implemented in Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (the 01202 code area) in November 2012 and the process ran smoothly.’","Telecoms watchdog Ofcom claims we are running out of landline numbers .

"A career con man who posed as a music label executive to scam Miami hotels out of $600,000 in presidential suites, bottles of champagne and haute cuisine has been sentenced to five years. It was just the latest con by James 'Jimmy' Sabatino, who has already served more than 15 years for scamming hotels across the U.S. and the U.K. and swindling a phone company out of millions - from inside his prison cell. Among his latest schemes, he pleaded for lazy eye surgery from inside prison in August - and eventually convinced authorities to spend $247,000 of taxpayers' money on the operation. On Tuesday, the 37-year-old appeared at his sentencing in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, where he was ordered to serve five years behind bars as well as three years of probation as part of a plea deal. Scroll down for video . Swindler: Career con man Jimmy Sabatino, pictured, has been jailed for five years for pretending to be a music label exec and racking up bills for hundreds of thousands of dollars he then failed to pay . Faker: He has spent 15 years in prison for multiple other scams. Left, he is pictured in his 2013 mug shot . He had pleaded guilty to grand theft and fraud after his hotel spree between July and September 2013 - just weeks after he was released from federal prison, the Miami Herald reported. He has been ordered to repay the whopping $594,000 he owes hotels, including $400,000 to the downtown Miami Hilton and $140,000 to the Hilton Bentley South Beach. Throughout the scam, he posed as a music-label exec and checked himself, his entourage, girlfriends and wannabe stars into the four luxury hotels. To score the rooms, he claimed he had launched the careers of Puff Daddy, Mark Wahlberg, the Notorious B.I.G. and Method Man, the Miami New Times reported. Fat pockets: He pretended he had launched the careers of stars including Puff Daddy and Mark Wahlberg . High life: On his Instagram page, he shares numerous photos of him drinking expensive champagne in hotel . Fans: He also posed for photographs with girls, some of whom he apparently treated to expensive jewelry . While at the Bentley hotel, he convinced staff that he worked for Sony. He stayed at an ocean-facing suite while his entourage drank $100,000 in alcohol and racked up $74,000 in other costs before scarpering without paying the bill. When cops found him, he had $50,000 worth of champagne in his car. Photographs on his Instagram page show him posing with massive wads of cash and expensive jewelry, posing with scantily-clad women and driving luxury cars. He also shares photographs of stars, including Jay-Z, as if he were hanging out with them. Sabatino has pulled scams before, starting when he was just 17, when he was arrested after he posed as a Coca-Cola executive to get hotel rooms. Then in 1995, he was given 262 free tickets to the Super Bowl by pretending to be a Blockbuster exec before he sold the tickets for $235,800. He was sentenced to two years in prison. Celebrity 'friends': One image taken last summer shows him hanging out with Wu-Tang Clan's Method Man . Poser: He regularly shared photographs of his wads of cash and champagne during his three-month spree . Lies: In fact, he has scammed his way to riches and star treatment since first posing as an exec in his teens . Lies: Among those scammed was Thomas Troop, who was convinced Sabatino would make him a star . Doting: A woman, who appears to have been Sabatino's girlfriend, shows off jewelry he apparently gave her . After he got out, 21-year-old Sabatino threw himself a $55,000 party at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square - but was arrested when he failed to pay the bill. While out on bail, he fled to London, where he scored a free room at the Four Seasons by pretending to be a movie-studio exec - before he was sentenced to prison there. He was deported to the U.S. after calling the FBI from  jail and threatening to kill President Clinton. In that case, he was sentenced to four years in prison but two years into his sentence, he was charged with running a scam from prison that defrauded a phone company out of $3 million. He was sentenced to 11 more years. Then in 2008, he fed the Los Angeles Times  fake FBI documents - which the newspaper printed - linking him to a 1994 assassination attempt on Tupac Shakur, the News Times reported. He was finally released in May 2013 - just weeks before starting his hotel spending spree. Then in August, Sabatino underwent his corrective eye surgery while in Miami-Dade Corrections custody. That too, he claims, was a scam. Night out: Another image, apparently taken with Troop, shows the men in the back of a cab on a night out . Luxury: In other images shared at the time, he ashowed off his Bentley ride and Rolex watches . All talk: He had previously served time for scamming a phone company out of millions and, when he was caught scamming a hotel in the U.K., he called the FBI saying he wanted to kill Clinton so he'd be extradited . Sneaking in: In one photograph, the career criminal poses with the Reverend Jesse Jackson . 'I kept saying I was having these headaches, and how can we make them stop?' Sabatino said. 'Next thing I know, they approved the surgery.' Sabatino had provided a referral letter from doctors claiming the lazy eye came from a stroke in 2013 - when the condition has affected him since he was a child, the Herald previously reported. He claims that the cost to taxpayers reached $247,000. The judge in his case expressed her outrage on learning about the procedure, but Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office spokesman Ed Griffith said doctors told them the surgery was medically necessary. The con man, who stands at 5ft 6 and 300 pounds, joked that he wonders if he can get officials to approve lap-band surgery next. The Herald noted that Sabatino's father once told a judge that his son's attention-seeking behavior came from him being abandoned by his mother as a child. Before his sentencing, he had repeatedly contacted the Herald and asked staff to publicize his upcoming sentencing. While there, he confirmed jailhouse interviews with several outlets.","Jimmy Sabatino, 37, was ordered to pay back $594,000 to the four hotels he cheated during a partying spree in summer 2013 .

"NHS funding will be protected and increased if the Conservatives win the election – meaning other new areas of public spending will be hit by savage cuts. David Cameron will use his final party conference speech before the General Election to pledge a ‘ringfence’ of the NHS’s vast budget until 2020. The promise places him squarely on Labour territory after Ed Miliband used his conference speech last week to put the issue at the centre of his 2015 campaign. Scroll down for video . Pledge: David Cameron, seen preparing for his party conference speech, will pledge a ‘ringfence’ of the NHS’s vast budget until 2020 . The Prime Minister will also challenge Ukip’s suggestion that Britain has gone to the dogs. He will insist the Conservatives are building ‘a Britain that everyone is proud to call home’. Pleading for another five years to finish the job, Mr Cameron will promise a country ‘where hard work is really rewarded, not a free-for-all, but a chance for all . . . the chance of a job, a home, a good start in life, whoever you are, wherever you are from’. Confronting Labour’s claim that it can ‘save’ the health service, the Prime Minister will insist: ‘The next Conservative government will protect the NHS budget and continue to invest more.’ Challenging: The Prime Minister will also challenge Ukip’s suggestion that Britain has gone to the dogs. He will insist the Conservatives are building ‘a Britain that everyone is proud to call home’ Controversy: Cameron's announcement of an extension of the NHS budget ring-fence - and the commitment to increase spending in real terms over the next five years - is likely to prove controversial . But the extension of the NHS budget ring-fence – and the commitment to increase spending in real terms over the next five years – is likely to prove controversial. Chancellor George Osborne warned this week that the nation’s debt levels remain ‘dangerously high’, and £25 billion in spending cuts will be necessary to balance the books. Soumaya Keynes, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said that based on figures at the last Budget, between 2014/15 and 2018/19, cuts of 3.1 per cent in all areas – totalling 11.9 per cent – will be required to eliminate the deficit. Continuing to protect the budgets of the NHS, schools and overseas aid, however, will mean harsher cuts in all other areas – including home affairs, justice and local government – of 6.1 per cent, or 22.1 per cent in total. Warning: Chancellor George Osborne warned this week that the nation’s debt levels remain 'dangerously high', and £25 billion in spending cuts will be necessary to balance the books . Ministers who have taken a third out of their budgets are likely to resist fiercely any attempts to make their departments shoulder all the pain in the next round of cuts. Mr Cameron will say today that the party had been right to shield the health service from the pain of austerity. ‘We know this truth – something Labour will never understand and we will never forget: you can only have a strong NHS if you have a strong economy.’ On his plan for the next five years, he will seek to demonstrate broader goals than deficit reduction. ‘I love this country – and my goal is this: to make Britain a country that everyone is proud to call home. Proud: Mr Cameron, seen taking a selfie with delegates at the conference, will say his goal is to make Britain 'a country that everyone is proud to call home' ‘That doesn’t just mean having the fastest-growing economy, or climbing some international league table.

A healthcare CEO credited with 'helping revitalize Camden' was found dead along with his wife following a house fire Sunday Morning. Cooper University Health System, where John Sheridan, Jr, was president and CEO, put out a statement Sunday announcing the dead of him and his wife, Joyce. The statement did not mention the cause of death, but Philly.com reported that a house fire that killed two on Meadow Run Drive in Montgomery matched the address given for Sheridan on political campaign contribution records. The statement issued by Cooper said the organization was 'saddened to announce the death' of Sheridan and his wife. 'There is no one else who has had as big an impact on me as John did except my father,' said Cooper Health System board of trustees chairman George E. Norcross III in the statement. Adrienne Kirby, president and CEO of Cooper University Health, remembered Sheridan for his 'quiet strength, his decisiveness and his passionate belief that Cooper not only could make a difference in people’s lives, it had an obligation to do so.' Sheridan was credited for getting the first new medical school in three decades built in New Jersey, having helped bring plans for the Cooper Medical School at Rowan University to fruition in 2012. 'Perhaps his greatest contribution to the larger Cooper community was his commitment to helping revitalize Camden,' the statement said. 'There was never a day that went by when he wasn’t focused on what Cooper could do to help revitalize the city that he loved.' Camden mayor Dana Redd released a statement of condolences as well. 'They will both be profoundly missed by the entire Camden community,' wrote Redd. 'I have personally known John Sheridan since 2001. We worked closely as Cooper enhanced their campus and during the early planning stages of the Cooper Medical School of Rowan University.' Sheridan began in law after graduating from Rutgers Law School. He later worked his way up to co-chairman at law firm Riker, Danzig, Riker, where he was also senior partner.

"A couple returning from France found two migrants stowed away in their trailer - next to a hot air balloon. Chris and Claire Monk made the unusual discovery in the car park of Calais' Campanile Hotel as they returned from a summer offering ballooning tours in Tuscany. They had checked their expansive trailer because of recent headlines over Calais' immigration crisis, but were still stunned to find two resigned-looking men in their late 20s crouched inside. Flummoxed: Chris Monk and his wife found two migrants stowed in their trailer - next to their hot air balloon . Security: The couple were staying at the Campanile hotel in Calais, whose car park has a low mesh fence . The men wandered off without protesting and Mr Monk, 52, spent the next 40 minutes combing over the contents of his trailer to make sure no one else had smuggled themselves inside. He and his wife, a 46-year-old graphic designer, spoke out to warn other tourists after their return to their village of Coxley, Somerset. 'We checked because last year we came back and the immigration officers pulled us over and searched us,' he said. 'Then there was the publicity from truck drivers and the like, and my mum said: ""Make sure you check your trailer!"". 'It was still a shock. It was still dark and we had noticed the velcro on one of the compartments of the larger trailer wasn’t exactly sealed, and the corresponding fastening clips loose but still secure. You can imagine our surprise. Plenty of room: The couple checked inside due to recent headlines - and they had been stopped before . 'I just said: ""Out - you two could have got me into a lot of trouble and cost me a lot of money"". 'Their body language just implied they were going to try again with someone else the next day.' The couple found the men, who they said were of African origin, in the car park of the hotel at around 7am on Saturday, October 18. Many car parks in Calais are secure, and although the Campanile's was not open to the street it had only a basic mesh fence and security gate. Mr and Mrs Monk, who had been ballooning in northern Italy since May, could have been fined up to £2,000 and had their trailer seized if they had not spotted the pair and been stopped by officials. They told the hotel about the incident but did not inform French police because, as Mr Monk put it: 'That wouldn't have achieved anything except making us miss our ferry'. He added: 'I can see both sides - these people are running away from something awful. Once they're in Europe they've escaped what they're running from, so there should be a European-wide solution to help them.' Yesterday Calais' mayor told MPs Britain was an ‘El Dorado’ for thousands of migrants because of generous handouts. Blaming the UK for the crisis, Natacha Bouchart said benefits and the prospect of illegal work and accommodation were magnets for determined people. She said the migrants, many fleeing humanitarian disasters in Africa and the Middle East, were ‘prepared to die’ to reach Britain. But Tory MP Lorraine Fullbrook hit back at the claims, telling Ms Bouchart: ‘You can’t expect us to disadvantage our people because France can’t police its borders.’ Return: The couple were staying overnight in the French port town after spending the summer in Tuscany .

"A baker who piled on the pounds after munching on her own delicious cakes has finally resisted temptation and lost almost 5st. Rachel Gillion, 40, from Cannock, Staffordshire, tipped the scales at 14st 5lb, but despite being surrounded by cake mixture, sugar, and icing every day, has managed to lose almost 5st. The cake baker, who makes handmade celebration and birthday cakes, joined Weight Watchers and now weighs in at a healthy 9st 8lb. Scroll down for video . By her own admission, Rachel had a terrible diet before her weight loss, picking at her baking ingredients as well as indulging in junk food . It was only when a friend suggested joining Weight Watchers that Rachel began to change her diet, dropping from 14st 5lb (left) to a trim 9st 11lb (right) Rachel said: 'I used to think nothing of eating the cakes. 'At my busiest I can make and decorate three to four cakes a week, so I was always surrounded by ingredients and unhealthy food. 'My favourite was carrot cake - I just couldn’t help but pick at them, I’ve got quite a sweet tooth. 'To be honest, I was just being greedy. 'On top of that, my diet was awful, I’d have at least one takeaway a week.' But after a friend suggested joining Weight Watchers just 10 months ago, Rachel has gone on to lose almost five stone. Rachel said: 'I was with my friend who’d just had a baby and she said that she was going to join Weight Watchers and did I want to go with her. 'I was absolutely dreading it. 'I thought you had to be really desperate to join Weight Watchers, but it was totally different to what I’d thought it was going to be. Rachel now continues to bake cakes for her online business, Cake Craft by Rachel, but is no longer tempted by her sweet treats . 'It was so easy and in the first week I lost five and half pounds. 'I was really focused, and didn’t pick at my cakes at all, when I saw that it was working I was determined to keep going.' Rachel now continues to bake cakes for her online business, Cake Craft by Rachel, but is no longer tempted by her sweet treats. Rachel said: 'I know it’s hard to believe but I don’t touch the cakes anymore. 'Before, I had such low self-esteem that I never went to any social events or went on nights out. 'I just did the school run and worked from home on the cakes. 'But now I’m so much more active and sociable - my life has changed.' Rachel has battled with her weight for as long as she can remember. Breakfast: Two rounds of white toast with butter . Snacks: Crisps and chocolate . Lunch: McDonalds meal . Dinner: Fish fingers and chips . Evening snack: Crisps or chocolate, glass of white wine . Breakfast: Fruit with Weight Watchers yoghurt . Snack: Weight Watchers snack bar or Weight Watchers crisps . Lunch: Ham sandwich and fruit . Diner: Chicken breast or salmon fillet with salad . No evening snack . She said: 'My weight has always been up and down. 'But everything went downhill after I had my third baby in 2010. 'I started to gain more weight and it was hard to keep in check - I have an underactive thyroid too so it was difficult. 'The underactive thyroid meant that I was gaining weight really easily, it was hard to deal with. 'I started to get very frustrated and I just ended up in a bit of a hole, I hated how big I was and I just used to hide away. 'I didn’t go anywhere, I’d made excuses so I didn’t have to go out. 'I was 5ft 2in and 14st 5lb - my self-esteem was at an all-time low.' Rachel’s poor diet contributed to her weight gain. She said: 'I would have a takeaway about once a week and my portions were way out of control. 'I would buy a big bag of sweets and just eat the whole bag. 'I could eat three or four bars of chocolate in an evening.” But thanks to the suggestion from her friend, Rachel began to lose weight and hasn’t looked back since. Rachel said: 'I never thought Weight Watchers would work for me, so I was supposed when I lost so much in the first week. 'Before I knew where I was the weight was just coming off - I can’t sing their praises enough. 'I reached my goal weight last week and I’m thrilled - I haven’t been this weight since I was 19. 'My family, and my husband have been supportive throughout, and I can already feel the health benefits. 'I’m even thinking about becoming a Weight Watchers leader - my own leader, Ange Smith, was incredible.

"Whether she's claiming that water has feelings or sharing her favourite healthy recipes, Gwyneth Paltrow uses her weekly Goop blog to share her innermost thoughts and feelings. This week the A-lister, who celebrated her 42nd birthday last week, has gone all New-Agey on us and called in a psychic to answer her most burning spiritual questions. 'Weird as it may sound considering our New Age leanings, not one of us freaks over at goop HQ had ever had a psychic reading,' writes Gwyneth. Scroll down for video . Calling in help: Gwyneth Paltrow, 42, has gone all new-agey on us by calling in a psychic to answer her and her friends' questions in this week's Goop instalment . 'But since we're on an unquenchable quest to experience every type of modality to help us heal, expand, and deepen our understanding of all life's mysteries, when we heard tell of an exceptionally gifted L.A.-based intuitive, Jill Willard, we had to talk to her - and talk to her some more.' Gwyneth goes on to explain that Willard, who does not refer to herself as a psychic thanks to 'woo woo' and negative connotations, sees things. And, she says, as a medium, Willard also sees dead people. 'But the experience isn't at all what you would expect,' adds Gwyneth. 'Willard thinks of herself as more of a guide or aid, whose function is to help people do this for themselves, by tapping into their own intuition, a state she believes we can all achieve'. Intrigued: The star says that she and her friends are on an 'unquenchable quest to experience every type of modality to help us heal, expand, and deepen our understanding of all life's mysteries' so called on a psychic to answer their burning questions . So fascinated by this is Gwyneth, that she asked Willard to share her views on life after death and how people can unlock this ability themselves. 'We all have a knowing,' Willard tells the actress. 'It's really just a question of whether we're willing to acknowledge and honor what we know, and act on it in a positive way. 'Often, we let our fears get in the way, or we shut it down because we don't want to believe there is another way, and we don't want to listen. 'I have been there, too, trust me. I have completely ignored what I knew to be true because I didn't like the truth - it wasn't what I wanted.' New York, NY - Gwyneth Paltrow was seen out and about to watch her mother's Blythe Danner Broadway play 'The Country House' after celebrating her 42nd birthday last week . Other questions that the mother-of-two asks Willard include: 'Is there destiny?' and 'Are the sixth and seventh chakras essentially the same thing?', which she replies to with in-depth answers. The new post comes as Gwyneth's estranged husband, Chris Martin, apparently threw a birthday party for her last week. Nicole Richie, Kate Hudson and Matt Bellamy were among the other stars in attendance. Chris is currently dating Jennifer Lawrence, and it is claimed Gwyneth has met her - and approves. A source told UK's LOOK magazine: 'Chris, Gwyneth and Jennifer were all in LA earlier this month, so Gwyneth suggested a friendly lunch between her and Jennifer. They met at her Brentwood home and drank tea and ate homemade scones while chatting in the garden.' 'Gwyn broke the ice by telling Jen she's happy Chris wound up with such a smart, beautiful woman.'

"Eight children were found living in a home near Marietta where sewage water was leaking over exposed wires and feces from a dog and a small child was littered throughout. The cops were called to the home of Stephen and Loni Tavizon on Saturday after a two-year-old child was found alone outside, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Once inside the home, officers said they encountered terrible conditions where 8 children were living, from ages 2 to 13. Family: Police said they found the children living in terrible conditions, that included a room with bags of rotting trash . A garage used as a living space contained more than 50 bags of trash, some rotting and attracting insects, as well as stained mattresses and the smell of sewage. In other areas of the home, damaged pipes leaked sewage water onto the floor and wiring was dangerously exposed to occupants. Scattered throughout the house was old food that had become moldy along with feces believed to be from the dog and a toddler. Police arrested both parents of the children and charged them with eight felony counts of cruelty to children, according to Cobb County jail records. Stephen Tavizon was also charged with two counts of contributing to the deprivation of a minor, a misdemeanor defined as not providing parental care necessary for a child's physical, mental or emotional health under Georgia state law. Deprivation? Records show the home of Stephen and Loni Tavizon was in an unsanitary condition, though Facebook photos of the couple show no sign of the alleged neglect . Home: A Facebook photo of Tavizon shows him relaxing with one of the children who was found in the poor condition of the home . Loni Tavizon is the mother of all eight children at the home and Stephen is the biological father of two of them, having guardianship over the other six. A Facebook page belonging to Stephen Tavizon claims he once worked aboard the USS John C. Stennis, an aircraft carrier. The couple's photos show them playing or snuggling with the children and give little sign of the disarray police found in the home.","The home of Stephen and Loni Tavizon was found in an unsanitary state with one room containing 50 bags of garbage that was rotting and attracting insects .

"A barbecue, a few shots of vodka and a friendly judo match are key elements of a plan by maverick senator Jacqui Lambie to mend relations between Russia and Australia. It comes after Prime Minister Tony Abbott earlier this month vowed to shirtfront the Russian president when he visits Australia for the upcoming G20 meeting, drawing derision and anger from the Russian media. The Palmer United Party senator met with Russian ambassador Vladimir Morozov on Tuesday and handed him two bottles of Tasmanian vodka and a t-shirt from the state's Ulverstone Judo Club. The club wants to hold a fundraising judo fight between the two leaders, and Senator Lambie believes this will do wonders for international relations with the nuclear superpower. Scroll down for video . Jacqui Lambie delivering a speech at Parliament House in Canberra. Ms Lambie has proposed a new law that would impose fines of up to $68,000 for parents who force their children to wear a burqa in public . Prime Minister Tony Abbott says he will question Russian leader Vladimir Putin face to face at the G20 summit . Bring it on: Both leaders have practised martial arts . Boxer: Mr Abbott was awarded a boxing blue for success in the ring while studying at Oxford University . 'They have put their money on President Putin,' the Tasmanian told the senate on Wednesday. 'A barbecue, beers and a couple of vodkas ... would also be on the agenda.' Club members want the t-shirt to go to Mr Putin 'with their best wishes' in appreciation of his promotion of the sport. They also want him to accept an honorary membership. Ms Bishop says the investigations have been 'very frustrating... on the ground in eastern Ukraine the rebels from time to time have prevented access to the site' Putin agreed to Bishops plea to help scientists return to the crash site, as well as assisting with the investigations into what was behind the crash . The relationship between Russia and Australia has been fragile since Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot out of the sky above eastern Ukraine. Russian-backed rebels are assumed responsible for the crash, which killed 38 Australians. Mr Putin angered many Australians with his handling of the incident and the delay in assisting international access to the crash site. Two-thirds of Australians support Prime Minister Tony Abbott confronting Vladimir Putin over the shooting down of MH17, after he pledged to 'shirtfront' the Russian leader over the tragedy. A Newspoll earlier this month found 63 per cent backed Mr Abbott taking a tough stance against President Putin at a G20 meeting in Brisbane next month, while only 27 per cent opposed it. Smackdown: Mr Putin was elevated to judo's eighth dan in 2012, Russian media reported, meaning he is a 'master' of the sport . The prime minister grabbed global headlines after pledging to shirtfront Mr Putin during the G20 leader meeting, comments he later backed away from. Labor leader Bill Shorten said he would not give the time of day to Mr Putin. But Mr Abbott, who will host the summit, says it is better to engage his Russian counterpart. 'I'm going to shirtfront Mr Putin,' the prime minister said on Monday. 'I'm going to be saying to Mr Putin, Australians were murdered. They were murdered by Russian-backed rebels using Russian-supplied equipment.' Abbott clarified his comments, explaining that he would hold 'robust talks' with the Russian president over the 'murder' of 38 Australians who died when MH17 was shot down over east Ukraine. Mr Abbott also said he would demand that Russia co-operate with the criminal investigation into the MH17 disaster and if evidence is required from the nation, it should be provided. Bishop says the investigations must be executed before the heavy snow typical of Ukrainian winter bury the site and hamper investigations.","Jacqui Lambie wants a judo match between Russia & Australia's leaders .

"20-year-old engineering student Lucas Patchett says his latest big idea came naturally. ‘It kind of tied in with engineering in that it’s innovative, it's not wanting to do the same old, same old,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I came back from a trip overseas and said to my mate: ‘Let’s stop talking about this and just go do it!’ So they did. In July this year, Patchett and friend Nicholas Marchesi from Brisbane got busy fitting out an old van with donated washing machines to start Orange Sky: Australia’s first mobile laundry service for the homeless. And it’s already proving a hit with many of the city's 300 people who sleep rough each night. 'We're still at the stage where people see us and are kind of like 'what's going on here?' But word is definitely getting around and the feedback has all been positive,' says Patchett. Scroll down for video . Lucas Patchett (left) and Nicholas Marchesi with their Orange Sky mobile laundry van . Patchett says there are one or two  places in Brisbane that offer free washing but that one of those is only open three days of the week, and the other gets hugely booked up. Otherwise, people have to pay $5 - $6 to do a wash at a laundromat. 'And $6 is a lot of money for someone without a roof over their head,' says Patchett. The Orange Sky van, which is installed with two industrial washing machines and two dryers, is currently doing the rounds of six different test locations in the Brisbane CBD. 'We're trying to link in with some of the morning BBQs and food vans offered by different groups around the city each day,' says Patchett. 'We actually try and get there before the food vans and say to the guys: ""Common, we'll get you through before everyone turns up to watch the show."" 'It's been interesting because some of these guys are pretty set in their ways and some people are a little hesitant until they know us - so its been about us establishing a bit of regular schedule.' Patchett says his favourite part of the job is being able to sit and 'chat with interesting people' while the washing machines are churning away . One load takes about an hour and 15 minutes to wash and dry. Patchett says the thing he enjoys most about the rounds is being able to sit and chat with interesting people in that time. 'I was chatting with a guy the other day who used to be a chemical engineer. It's just a very grounding experience to see how quickly things can go wrong for people,' he says. 'Homelessness is the kind of issue that people turn a blind eye to but I hope that in the future, we'll be able to engage supporters and even school kids to  come out with us in the van, volunteer and get talking to people.' In fact, Patchett says one of the reasons behind the idea for Orange Sky was what he and Marchesi saw as a lack of accessible volunteer opportunities for recent school leavers in Brisbane. Picking up the donated industrial washing machines . Fitting the machines to the old van was a bit of a challenge, 'but we squeezed them in,' Patchett says . He said there were one or two moments when the friends thought the idea wouldn't get off the ground. The first was trying to fit the washers into the van. 'The architect who helped us said:  ""they'll probably fit"", but we found we needed to build a platform above the wheel arches - it wasn't very scientific but we ended up  banging the wheel arches out a bit and taking some panels off. We squeezed them in.' The other issue was going through all the legal hoops to operate as a charity. 'It was very frustrating for Nick and I as we're both pretty impatient people, but we were determined not to let this keep us from hitting the road!' Lucas and Nicholas with their machines donated by Richard Jay and LG . And the name? 'Well it's our favourite colour but it's also the name of a song we really love by Alexi Murdoch,' says Patchett. 'The song is about helping your brothers and sisters and Nic and I, not in a religious way or anything, but we live our lives by the golden rule of treating others as we'd want to be treated and living  to help other people - Everyone deserves clean clothes right?' Orange Sky hopes to be able to expand to provide more mobile laundries nation-wide in 2015. ‘I came back from a trip overseas and said to my mate: ‘Let’s stop talking about this and just go do it!’ says Lucas Patchett (pictured right) 'Orange Sky is an awesome song about helping your brothers and sisters,' says Patchett (Left)","Brisbane friends have fitted out an old van with donated washing machines to provide free laundry service for the city's homeless .

"Bad deal: Phoenix man Walter Earl Morrison has been charged with stealing a diamond worth $160,000 and trading it for a bag of marijuana worth twenty dollars . A Phoenix man has been charged with stealing a diamond worth $160,000 and trading it for a bag of marijuana worth twenty dollars. Walter Earl Morrison, 20, was working for UPS at Phoenix Sky Harbor when police say he swiped a package. Inside, Morrison allegedly discovered the jewel where he expected to find cash. Evidently, Morrison found himself at a loss as to what to do next, or possibly with a powerful desire to get stoned. Whichever it was, Morrison allegedly swapped the gem for ganja before police honed in on him. The diamond was soon recovered, as well, and delivered to its owner, reports KNXV. Police charged Morrison with felony theft. He's since been fired from his job with UPS. Morrison's alleged heist, while large by many standards, is puny compared to some of the jewel thefts of recent memory. Wearing a scarf to mask his face, a gunman sneaked into the posh Carlton hotel in Cannes, France and held up a diamond show as three security guards looked on, then fled on foot about a minute later. In the end, he made off with a breathtaking $136 million worth of valuables — the biggest jewelry heist in years, maybe ever. Back in May 2013, 31 were arrested on charges they helped rob a shipment of diamonds worth $50 million from the Brussels airport. And just this month, an extremely rare diamond worth at least $577,000 was snatched from a Sydney auction house. The pink argyle and white diamond band was on a display counter at Theodore Bruce Auctions in Alexandria when it went missing. Morrison was working on a UPS cargo plane when he allegedly swiped the gem. He's since been let go by the company .","Walter Earl Morrison, 20, was working on a UPS plane at Phoenix Sky Harbor when police say he stole a package containing the diamond ."
"A former pitching coach at The University of Miami allegedly injected a minor athlete with the same human growth hormone supposedly given to suspended New York Yankee player Alex Rodriguez 'A-Rod'. Lazaro 'Lazer' Daniel Collazo, 50, is charged with conspiracy to distribute testosterone and human growth hormone (HGH) to Major League Baseball (MLB) players and high school athletes. An indictment filed on Thursday states that Collazo injected a minor with HGH in June of 2012 and ordered HGH twice, once in 2011 and 2012 also for distribution to a minor, reports NBC. Charged: Lazaro 'Lazer' Daniel Collazo, 50, is charged with conspiracy to distribute testosterone and human growth hormone (HGH) to Major League Baseball (MLB) players and high school athletes . Suspended: Alexander Rodriguez 'A-Rod' is one of 14 Major and minor league baseball players suspended in connection to the HGH Biogenesis clinic investigation . Collazo supposedly acquired the HGH from the Biogenesis anti-aging clinic founded by Anthony Bosch. Bosch has plead guilty and is cooperating with the feds. The New York Daily News reports that Collazo posted a $50,000 bond last week, wasn't jailed, and is free unless he violates any of the bond conditions. During the U.S. Attorney's press conference on August 5, Prosecutor Wifredo Ferrer labelled Collazo 'a customer of Bosch's who recruited high school athletes and other individuals.' The Drug Enforcement Administration special agent Mark Trouville added that Collazo represented a 'particularly disturbing part of this investigation.' Pleaded guilty: Anthony Bosch the former Biogenesis of America clinic owner pictured here in August has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with investigators . 'He utilized his close to 30 years involvement in South Florida baseball. He used these connections to actively recruit underage high school athletes for Mr. Bosch,' said Trouville. Collazo is one of four men from South Florida, including the cousin of Alex Rodriguez, charged in a superseding indictment filed on Thursday in Miami, announced the Attorney for the Southern District of Florida today. Alex Rodriguez's cousin, 52-year-old Yuri Sucart, along with Juan Carlos Nunez, 48, and Paulo Berejuk, 50, are all charged in the indictment. NBC reports that Berejuk was denied bond in a federal court on Thursday. The Drug Enforcement Administration said that Berejuk made performance-enhancing drugs in his garage and supplied Bosch with it for several years. Bosch has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with investigators, including providing key information to the DEA about Berejuk's involvement. Collazo’s attorney, Frank Quintero Jr., said he spoke with a prosecutor who said that the government has no evidence that Collazo provided performance-enhancing drugs. Collazo left the University of Miami in 2003 after nearly 18 years with the Hurricanes. A-Rod is one of 14 Major and minor league baseball players suspended in connection to the investigation.

"Nigel Farage is certainly no shrinking violet. And if these photos are anything to go by, neither is his mother. Barbara Stevens, 74, is the rather game lady reclining in the roses and lazing by the lavender in a series of risque calendars to raise money for charity. Making Nigel blush: Barbara Stevens, the Ukip leader's mother, had pink roses painted on her in 2009 . Frothy: Miss Stevens, 74, reclines on a chair made to look like a bubble bath in net and feathers . Lavender lover: A rather daring Miss Stevens does a spot of gardening as she poses almost completely naked for a Women's Institute calendar . Spanner in the works: The Ukip leader's mother has appeared in a number of calendars for her local Women's Institute . On at least four occasions since 2005, the Ukip leader’s mother has posed in various states of undress on behalf of her local Women’s Institute. Coincidentally, she has chosen colour themes that cover the political spectrum. For her first calendar appearance in 2005, it was Lib Dem yellow, as she posed in nothing but a hard hat, pearls and heels behind a hydraulic machine. In 2007 she was photographed with several well-placed pots of lavender – appropriately Ukip purple. For her Miss July portrait in 2009, she was covered in pink body paint and clutched a bunch of Labour-red roses. Two years later, having passed the age of 70, she struck a more modest pose on a Tory blue chaise longue – but was still naked beneath a profusion of feathers and net. Today Miss Stevens, a former Conservative voter, says she is a fully paid-up Ukip member. She said that she has no plans to pose naked again, adding: ‘I don’t think Nigel needs that sort of publicity to be honest. ‘But they were tastefully produced – we weren’t aiming for the top shelf. ‘We raised a net profit of £42,000 over the years, and it was a wonderful achievement.’ Blushing: Mr Farage did not comment on his mother's naked posing, but his spokesman said he was happy with her charity work . Mr Farage's half sister Melanie Thomas (pictured posing as Pocahontas in 2009), 43, does not shy away from nudity either . Miss Stevens (centre) appeared as one of the three wise men for a calendar, with a gold gift covering her chest . In 2007 Miss Stevens stood naked behind a piano (centre) while fellow WI members surrounded Father Christmas . Miss Stevens' daughter Melanie,  Mr Farage's half-sister, appeared three times. In 2007 she laid back on a bench and stroked a cat . Miss Stevens admitted her son, Mr Farage, 50, and his brother Andrew, 48, were not entirely delighted about her readiness to get her kit off. ‘My sons wonder what their mother is going to get up to next,’ she said. Her escapades began ten years ago when she asked neighbours to join her ‘Downe Dames’ calendar group, named after the village of Downe near Orpington, South-East London, where she brought up her sons after divorcing their father. She also has two other children from her second marriage. Miss Stevens, who uses her maiden name, is a regular speaker at WI events, where her calendars are a favourite topic. Mr Farage’s half-sister is no wallflower either. Barbara Stevens’s daughter Melanie Thomas, 43, portrayed American Indian immigrant Pocahontas in 2009 . Asked about his mother’s nude modelling, Mr Farage last night said: ‘I’m going to make no comment about it myself.’ But a spokesman for Mr Farage said: ‘Nigel is very happy with how much money his mother raises for charity.’","Nigel Farage's mother has posed naked for WI calendars sold in her village .

"The husband of a Chicago actress who was killed after being struck by a falling tree branch is suing the park where the accident occurred. Molly Glynn, 46, a veteran of the Chicago stage who also appeared in notable television dramas, died in September after being struck by a tree while cycling on a forest preserve trail. She was caught in a storm along with husband and fellow actor Joe Foust. Joe Foust is now suing the Forest Preserve District of Cook County. Killed: Molly Glynn, a veteran of the Chicago stage and actress appearing in notable television dramas, died in September after being struck by a tree while cycling a forest preserve trail . Accident: Police arrived on scene to find actress Molly Glynn injured by the falling tree. She was pronounced dead the next day . Mr Foust filed the suit in Cook County Circuit Court on Thursday, alleging that the district was negligent in keeping 'diseased, defective, weakened' trees, which 'presented a risk of harm to persons using the bike path.' Mr Foust claims Cook County were negligent, alleging that the district failed to inspect, prune and maintain the trees and failed to warn people using the bike path that the trees were not safe. The suit also alleges that such a failure to inspect the trees was done 'with an utter indifference and conscious disregard for the safety of the public and Molly Anne Glynn.' At the time of the accident, Mr Foust called 911 and police responded to the scene. Glynn died the following day in hospital. 'She's gone,' Foust wrote on Facebook. 'I couldn't save her.' Stage star: Glynn, seen here with husband Joe Foust, regularly appeared in prestigious Chicago theater productions. Her husband is now suing the park where she died . Besides recognition across the Chicago theater community for her regular appearances on prestigious stages such as Steppenwolf, Writers, Next, Chicago Shakespeare, and Northlight, she gained national attention with television credits on shows like 'Boss' and 'Chicago Fire.' 'A beautiful woman and one would think that she would only be a leading . lady, but the truth is she also had great skill and breadth and scope as . an actress,' said Northlight Theater artistic director BJ Jones in a statement. Friends and family of the actress managed to raise $164,000 for her husband to pay for medical and funeral expenses, along with a support and trust fund for their two children. On stage: Molly Glynn, from left, Kevin McKillip, and Raymond Fox star in the 'Unnecessary Farce' by First Folio Theater. She was tragically killed as she rode her bike alongside her husband . Tragic: Glynn, 46, was caught in a storm along with husband and fellow actor Joe Foust. She was killed by a falling tree branch . Glynn was especially known for playing strong women. One of her most impressive roles was as a wife dealing with her husband's infidelity in the 2003 Steppenwolf Garage production of 'Orange Flower Water.' Theater critic Chris Jones singled Glynn out in a review of the 2012 production of 'Homecoming 1972' in which she played a waitress. 'Much of the acting is strong. Glynn, for example, takes that diner waitress, a tricky assignment indeed, and fleshes her out in all . kinds of unexpected ways, layering the character with levels of pain, . desire and resilience.' Actor Jeff Still wrote a touching tribute to her on Facebook. 'Chicago, and the world, has lost one sassy, lovely, talented redhead. I . can't pretend I knew her better than I did, but anyone who is or has . been a part of the great theater community of Chicago knows it's a very . tight-knit group, and we all swim in the same pool,' he wrote. 'My heart goes out to Joe, and all of their family, and all of my . brothers and sisters in the Chicago theater community, especially those . who knew Molly well. And my heart goes out to all of us, as this kind of . death is always a sobering, shattering reminder of how fragile all our . lives are.'","Glynn, 46, was caught in the storm while bicycling with husband Joe Foust .

"Men missing legs, arms, fingers and toes - these compelling portraits show the disfigured and maimed bodies of soldiers wounded in battle during the Civil War. While an estimated 600,000 to 800,000 were killed in the four-year long war, it is also infamous for the high number of amputations doctors carried out on wounded soldiers. A blood-curdling range of saws, knives and sharp hooks were used to administer surgery to maimed fighters - an estimated 60,000 amputations were completed between 1861 - 1865. Scroll down for video . Left, surgery notes state Private Columbus G. Rush had his legs amputated for gunshot injuries sustained on March 25, 1865, at the Battle of Petersburg, Virginia. Right, Samuel Irwin, of the 67th Pennsylvania Volunteers, had his right arm cut off at the shoulder joint . Pictured left wearing a support apparatus and right without it is Private Joshua S. Mason, who had four inches of his humerus, or upper arm bone, removed . Amputations were undertaken quickly, without anesthetic and using large saws similar to those now used to cut tree branches. These compelling images, released by the National Museum of Health and Medicine, show the results. The soldiers' treatment is a far cry from the kind of high-tech care such as flying-helicopters and battlefield operating theatres that injured soldiers available for use in modern warfare. In many of the portraits, men are pictured without legs, arms or fingers. Others have had damaged bones removed in operations leaving them significantly disfigured. The Civil War occurred at a time when the importance of sterilization in surgery was not as well known as it is today, or circumstances prevented it. Given the high number of wounded soldiers coming through the battlefield doctors' surgeries, amputation was often the quickest and most efficient way of preventing deadly infections, such as gangrene.

"Inter Milan fought back from two goals down to snatch a point against Lazio at the San Siro. The Nerazzurri have struggled for form since Roberto Mancini's return in November but their comeback on Sunday evening did at least prevent a third defeat in five games. Inter's fans feared the worst when Lazio's Felipe Anderson opened the scoring in just the second minute of play - his powerful shot from 10 yards out burst through Samir Handanovic's legs amid groans from the stands. Felipe Anderson scored a brace as Lazio beat Inter Milan in their Serie A clash on Sunday evening . The Brazilian's first goal was scored in just the second minute of play at the San Siro .

And the Brazilian struck again in the 37th minute, this time showing off his close control to dribble past the host's defence before finishing at the near post. But Mateo Kovacic pulled one back for Inter with a magnificent second-half volley from outside the box. Federico Marchetti may feel he could have done more to prevent the goal but the power with which Inter's midfielder struck his shot was too much for the Lazio keeper's weak attempt at a parry. Rodrigo Palacio then equalised with 10 minutes to go, poking home from two yards out after some woeful defending from the visitors at a set piece. The result leaves Roberto Mancini's side 11th in the Serie A table - six points adrift of the Champions League places and nine clear of the relegation zone.

"Within minutes of confirmation he had scraped home in the battle to protect the union, David Cameron immediately tried to regain the initiative by promising ‘English votes for English laws'. But what quickly became clear is that he is a million miles from being able to explain how he would honour his commitment – and that what he may end up proposing is likely to fall well short of the demands of many Tory MPs. Backbenchers, led by John Redwood, say that, as a quid pro quo for giving the Scots new powers over tax, benefits and finance, Scottish MPs should be stripped of the right to vote on these issues at Westminster, when they relate solely to England. The Scots would also lose the right to vote on other devolved issues such as the NHS and education. Addressing the nation Prime Minister David Cameron vowed to listen to 'millions of English people', beginning what could be a new and potentially equally acrimonious fight to introduce 'English votes for English laws' Under the backbench idea, favoured by some Cabinet members, Westminster would continue to be the home of the UK Government. But it would most likely hold two different sittings. MPs from across the UK would sit to discuss issues such as defence, foreign policy and immigration. Separate sessions would then take place, attended solely by English MPs, possibly in the form of a grand committee, to vote on English only matters, like the Heath Service. The Prime Minister knows this idea will be popular with many of his backbenchers, who have long being angry over the so-called West Lothian question – indeed, without such a pledge, they may not agree to vote for the package of bribes he promised to Scotland in his last-ditch bid to avoid a Yes vote. In a carefully-crafted soundbite, Mr Cameron said: ‘I've long believed that a crucial part missing from this national discussion is England. We've heard the voice of Scotland, but now the millions of voices of England must also be heard. 'The question of English votes for English laws, the so-called West Lothian question, requires a decisive answer. 'So just as Scotland will vote separately in the Scottish Parliament on their issues of tax, spending and welfare so too England as well as Wales and Northern Ireland should be able to vote on these issue - and all this must take place in tandem with and at the same pace the settlement for Scotland.' But his statement begs far more questions than it answers and William Hague, speaking after the Prime Minister, ruled out the idea of an English Parliament. Mr Hague said: ‘I don’t think people in this country will want, and I don’t think our work will lead to more expensive government and politics.’ Alex Salmond's Yes campaign was forced to face a convincing defeat as 55 per cent of Scots opted to stay as part of the United Kingdom in the historic independence referendum . Instead, Government aides are pointing to two existing reports on constitutional change. One is called the McKay report, and the other was penned by Ken Clarke. These would mean that when a Bill went through Parliament on the likes of health or education, there would be certain stages at which only English MPs could vote. Most likely, only English MPs would be able to amend the legislation. But, crucially, Scottish MPs would still be able to vote on the general principle. This, to many Tory MPs and supporters, could hardly be said to constitute ‘English votes for English laws’. Doubtless Ukip will have a field day pointing this out. What is certain is that Labour’s high command hates any suggestion of the idea that Scottish MPs should be stripped of their powers. Douglas Alexander, himself a Scottish MP, said it was a ‘knee jerk response... driven more by politics than the needs of the constitution’. It’s not surprising Labour are opposed, since turkey’s don’t vote for Christmas. Currently, the party has 40 MPs in Scotland who can be relied on to agree with the party command’s position on the supposed evils of NHS reform, opposition to Michael Gove’s school reforms and the rest. Strip them out, and the party at Westminster would be weakened considerably. Indeed, based on current opinion polls, it could spell chaos for Ed Miliband. At present, he is on course to win in 2015 with a majority of around 30 seats. Take out the Scots and he would no longer command a majority in England on his pet subjects of the NHS and education. He may even struggle to carry finance bills – though it’s far from clear what voting rights Scots MPs would have on this issue. For instance, they may be unable to vote on income tax, which is being devolved to the Scots, but be given a say on everything else. Some are even questioning whether – if Scots are no longer able to vote on crucial matters relating to England – there could ever again be a Scottish Prime Minister, Chancellor, Health Secretary, Education Secretary or Work and Pensions Secretary. In recent years, that would have meant no Gordon Brown, no Alistair Darling and no John Reid at Health, for starters. Any plans to ban Scottish MPs from voting on English issues could be opposed by Ed Miliband's Labour party, as they currently have 40 MPs in Scotland who are relied on to tow the party line when it comes to big issues . So what happens next? Mr Cameron says he wants to drive the changes through before the General Election, which seems an awesome task. If Labour does oppose the plans, could the PM rely of Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats to force them through? Mr Clegg is on the record as saying it is unfair for Scots to continue to vote on English only matters. But, on the other hand, the Lib Dem betrayal over boundary reform taught Mr Cameron not to trust his deputy as far as he could throw him. Certainly, Mr Clegg would demand sweeteners of his own, such as extra powers for the English regions and the great cities of the north. This, in turn, would not necessarily be popular with Tory MPs… . In other words, it could turn into a nine-month constitutional car crash which dominates the remainder of the Parliament and has the capacity to turn very ugly indeed.","David Cameron today pledged to listen to 'millions of English voices'

"She's an actress, director, producer, fashionista - oh, and did we mention she's one half of Hollywood’s most iconic and influential couples? Jada Pinkett-Smith, who is married to Will Smith and is mother to two equally famous children, may be 42 but she's looking better than ever - just take a look at her latest fashion shoot if you don't believe us. The A-lister has been treated to a high-fashion makeover for Net-a-Porter's The Edit and can be seen posing in an array of figure hugging dresses shot on a balcony in New York by Miranda Kerr's favourite photographer, Chris Colls. Scroll down for video . Will Smith is one lucky man! Jada Pinkett Smith, 42, has been given a seriously slick makeover for The Edit's latest edition, within which she opens up about female empowerment and her marriage . Although she displays an enviably toned physique in the new imagery, Jada maintains that she takes a relaxed approach to her fitness. 'I look better than ever and I work out less. I’m never . in the gym for [more than] 45 minutes,' she said. 'As I’ve gotten older, . I’ve learned that it’s about being physical every day. You don’t have to . go to the gym if that’s not your thing. You can go outside your door . and walk around your block.' One thing that Jada was keen to open up about in the interview with the magazine was her husband, Will Smith, explaining that their relationship is stronger now than ever, despite the rumours that have persistently dogged their 17-year romance. Better than ever: Although she displays an enviably toned physique in the new imagery, Jada maintains that she takes a relaxed approach to her fitness and never works out for longer than 45 minutes . Relaxed approach to fitness: Jada says that as she has gotten older, she's learned that it's about being physical every day - even if that means going for a brisk walk . Strong bond: Over the years, she and Will have been accused of unfounded infidelities, of having an 'open marriage' and have even had their sexualities questioned, all of which she shrugs off . 'Will, to me, encompasses everything. It’s almost as if calling him ""my husband"" is too small of a word for what he means in my life,' she said. Married for 17 years, she reveals how their relationship has changed over time. 'We used to have all these rules, [but] as you go on in your relationship, you just get into a flow… I had a very stuck idea of what a husband looks like, what a wife should be. 'Once I broke all of that, a whole new world opened for me and man, oh, man, I got to see him in all his glory. And so that’s what it’s evolved into. And I’m just ecstatic about it.' Over the years, the couple have been accused of unfounded infidelities, of having an ‘open marriage’ and have even had their sexualities questioned. Jada shrugs off these rumours, saying: 'The coping technique is knowing what the truth is - there’s no better technique…It’s kind of entertaining. We can laugh because it’s so ridiculous. I don’t take it personally.' Female empowerment: Jada puts her fame and power to good use - she once visited Washington to testify on sex trafficking and now she's working with CNN on a documentary about it . As well as the state of their own marriage, the Smith’s were at the centre of media scrutiny earlier this year when 13-year-old daughter Willow found herself amidst controversy when an Instagram picture of herself in bed next to topless 20-year-old actor Moises Arias went viral. The . 42-year-old star insisted there was 'nothing sexual' about the snap, which . was noticed on one of Kylie Jenner's Tumblr accounts on Tuesday. Speaking in a video on TMZ, . she said at the time: 'Here's the deal. There was nothing sexual about that picture . of that situation. You guys are projecting your trash onto it … and . you're acting like covert paedophiles and that's not cool.' Speaking out: Jada says that being a woman in an industry that has a voice made her feel this enormous amount of responsibility to speak out about female empowerment . Aside from her duties as a mother and actress, Jada has always been a huge advocate of female empowerment. In 2012, she visited Washington to . testify on sex trafficking and now she's working with CNN on a . documentary on the subject. 'A lot of people want to believe it only . happens to poor girls, and that’s not true. It’s a people problem,' she says. 'Being a woman in an industry . that has a voice, I just felt this enormous amount of responsibility to . at least let other people know. ""Guess what guys? It’s not just . happening over there. It’s happening right here."" I just had to get that . word out.'

"A second-half hat-trick from Antoine Griezmann inspired Atletico Madrid as they came from behind to beat Athletic Bilbao 4-1 at the San Mames stadium in La Liga on Sunday. Bilbao went ahead on 17 minutes when Mikel Rico headed in, and the hosts were comfortable in their play up to half-time. But Diego Simeone must have had stern words with his La Liga champions. Athletic Bilbao: Iraizoz, De Marcos, Gurpegi, Etxeita, Balenziaga, San Jose, Balenziaga, Susaeta, López Cabrera, Muniain, Aduriz. Subs: Moran, Etxebarria Urkiaga, Gómez, Bustinza Martínez, Herrerín Buisán, Fernández Hierro, Aketxe. Scorers: Rico 17 . Atletico Madrid: Moya, Juanfran, Giménez de Vargas, Godín, Siqueira, Turan, Gabi, Tiago, Niguez, Raúl Garcia, Griezmann. Subs: Suarez, Jimenez, Oblak, Gamez, Rodríguez, Hernández, Keita . Scorers: Griezmann 46, 73, 81,  Raul Garcia 53. Att: 46,500 . The urgency in their play was instantly noticeable as the second period started and Antoine Griezmann hauled the Madrid club level immediately after the break with a header. Tiago then won a soft penalty for Atletico seven minutes later, tumbling over in the penalty area after minimal contact from a Mikel San Jose challenge. Raul Garcia stepped up and converted, sending goalkeeper Gorka Iraizoz the wrong way. Griezmann then secured the victory in superb fashion on 73. He controlled a crossfield pass from Gabi with the outside of his boot before closing in on goal and lashing assuredly past Iraizoz. He then completed his treble from close range after Garcia's shot at goal was blocked. The win leaves the Simeone's side three points behind league leaders Real Madrid going into the Christmas break, and in third position in the Spanish league.

"Prince George has been credited with a surge in popularity for real wool products as consumers flock to mimic his traditional dress. The 15-month-old prince, who has been seen swaddled in a variety of traditional, cardigans, jumpers and blankets, is said to have sparked an increase in sales in some quarters of up to 400 per cent. His grandfather, Prince Charles, who gave George a beautiful woolen jumper when he was born, will no doubt be delighted as the founder of this week’s national Campaign for Wool week. Scroll down for video . Sales boom: The Duchess of Cambridge's taste for traditional babywear is credited with sparking the trend . Adorable: Many of Prince George's traditional clothes are made from good old-fashioned wool . The little prince - and his mother - have championed ‘heritage babywear’, resulting in one company’s website crashing thanks to unprecedented demand, while another sold out of its traditional woollen christening shawls. Peter Ackroyd, the chief Operations Officer at the Campaign for Wool, said the ‘Prince George effect’ was a welcome addition to an across the board swing away from trendy ‘street’ baby wear to more old-fashioned children’s clothing. ‘It is wonderful that mothers are once again realising the great qualities of wool,’ he said. 'We are currently in the midst of Wool Week, a celebration of all things wool, and this is yet more good news to celebrate.' George Austin of wool label Cable added: ‘Customers want what Prince George is wearing for their little ones.’ Prince of sales: Despite being just one, George has already helped make the fortunes of several designers . Looking good: Parents have rushed to copy George's traditional style for their own little princes . The young Prince had an almost immediate impact on the sales of wool when three days after he was born he appeared on the steps of the hospital wrapped in a £45 merino christening shawl by Nottingham-based GH Hurt & Son. The company said that the phone was 'ringing off' the hook when the images appeared on the evening news. Likewise, the achingly hip British-based fashion label Wool and the Gang have introduced a baby range to take advantage of a fourfold increase in demand for products in the natural fibre. Ashleigh Tennent, Marketing & Customer Experience Director, said: 'At Wool and the Gang we've seen a massive surge in the popularity of wool and knitting, with sales up 440 per cent year on year for the past three months. 'We're now launching a new wool-based Mini Collection for ages 1-10 due to high customer demand, which is hand-knitted by our network of knitters or as an easy-to-follow Knit Kit. 'Wool has amazing qualities that makes it great for young children. It's breathable, stretchy, made to last, and is easy to care for. It's also naturally stain resistant, a good thing for little ones!' Support: George's grandfather Prince Charles has long supported the Campaign for Wool . Fan: Prince Charles - and the Duchess of Cornwall - are both fans of woollen ensembles . When he was eight months old Prince George sparked a demand for cream jumpers and cardigans when he arrived in one during the Royal Tour of New Zealand. As a result, wool label Cable saw a surge in demand for similar products - something that designer Austin says has continued. '[Parents] have seen the Prince cuddled up in his mother’s arms on the tarmac in the knit and they want the same for their little one,' he said. During the same tour, Debenhams reported a 62 per cent spike in traditional styles of baby boys’ clothing. Demand: Thanks to George, demand for wool products has shot up and sales now total more than £300 million . The demand for romper suits and cardigans in traditional cotton and wool fabrics was particularly strong, they said. The British wool industry, virtually on the brink of extinction five years ago, has seen a remarkable resurgence since Prince Charles began the Campaign for Wool. Currently celebrating its fifth anniversary with the annual Wool Week, the industry has grown by 70 per cent in the last three years to record sales of more than £300m. It now employs more than 8,000 people in 40 mills and most of its production is exported.","Prince George has sparked a 400 per cent increase in wool sales .

"There are more than 1,200 police officers currently working undercover but only half of these are registered to the database intended to index them, a damning new report has revealed. The Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) report shows that of the 1,229 officers working undercover, only 568 are registered to the national index - which the report said renders it completely 'unsuitable to the task for which it was created'. It also concluded a shake-up of the National Undercover Working Group, which aims to raise standards in undercover policing, is now desperately needed in the wake of recent scandals where officers were found to be forming relationships with women they spied on and adopting dead children's identities. HMIC's report reveals for the first time that there are 1,229 undercover officers working in England and Wales and a total of 3,466 undercover operations were authorised between October 2009 and September 2013. A series of scandals in which officers were found to have been sleeping with women they were spying on and adopting dead children's identities have damaged the public's faith in undercover policing . The report was commissioned by Home Secretary Theresa May after it was revealed undercover officers had spied on the family of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence. Inspector Stephen Otter, who led the inspection, said: 'It was disappointing to find inconsistencies and shortcomings in the way undercover officers were supported by policies, systems and training across the country. 'Throughout our inspection, undercover officers were consistent in voicing their concerns about the ways in which forces required them to work differently from other forces and from what they understood from their training to be a nationally agreed way of working. 'This is clearly inefficient and, at worst, could lead to avoidable mistakes being made.' Inspectors raised concerns about the 'poor knowledge and lack of expertise' of senior leaders who authorise the use of undercover officers, although they found officers themselves to be 'knowledgeable, professional and courageous'. HMIC said the professional standards body, the College of Policing, had to cancel three of the four courses which it had organised for authorising officers as the numbers of chief officers signing up to attend was so low. 'It did not come as any surprise to us, therefore, to find that the quality of written authorities by assistant chief constables varied greatly, with too many not providing sufficient details to explain the necessity and proportionality of the decision to authorise the deployment of undercover officers,' the report said. The report was commissioned after it was revealed undercover officers had spied on the family of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence (pictured) Elsewhere, the Inspectorate criticises the lack of psychological support in some forces and has called for a combined 10-year cap on length of tenure for foundation and advanced undercover officers after it found an example of one officer who had worked on undercover operations for more than 20 years. Inspectors said it was 'disappointing' to find 'material weaknesses' in the leadership of undercover policing and urged chief constables to work together immediately to adopt a single set of standard operating procedures. Commander Martin remains a member of the Working Group but was replaced as chairman by Bedfordshire Police Assistant Chief Constable Jon Boutcher. Mr Martin, a former British Army serviceman, became national lead for undercover policing in January 2013. He joined West Midlands Police in 1994 and moved to the Metropolitan Police in 2004 following a stint in the National Criminal Intelligence Service. HMIC found the working group lacked 'effective and co-ordinated direction', was 'unclear about its role' and its chair and members were also unclear about how it was being held to account for the work which it was undertaking. 'This is unacceptable, especially in the light of today's widely-held understanding of just how important sound oversight of this essential yet intrusive police tactic is,' the report added. Elsewhere, a 'culture of secrecy amongst the undercover community' and a view that the 'undercover community has been nailed shut for years' were hindering progress. Inspectors said in one instance they were initially denied access to covert premises housing an undercover unit and were told that 'chief officers were not allowed access to the same premises'. This 'closed' attitude was behind the 'failure' of the police to adapt undercover policing response to online threats such as child sexual exploitation. It found that 25 forces had a dedicated undercover online capability, 13 further forces worked with neighbouring forces on the issue and five forces did not have any undercover online capability at all.","Damning report reveals more than 1,200 officers are working undercover .

"The captain of the Costa Concordia arranged to flee in a helicopter, abandoning passengers and crew, on the night of the shipwreck, his Moldovan lover has claimed. The giant cruise ship hit rocks and sank off the Mediterranean island of Giglio on January 13, 2012, killing 32 people, in Italy's worst maritime catastrophe since the Second World War. Captain Francesco Schettino is on trial for multiple manslaughter, dereliction of duty and abandoning ship, and faces up to 20 years in prison if he is found guilty. Scroll down for video . Claims: Domnica Cemortan (left) claims Costa Concordia captain Francesco Schettino (right) arranged to flee in a helicopter, abandoning passengers and crew, on the night of the shipwreck . Domnica Cemortan, the dancer who was accused of distracting the captain on the night of the crash, made the revelation after giving her former lover an ultimatum of six days 'to tell the truth'. But when he was unforthcoming the blonde former hostess claimed that she was part of a plan to leave the ship and those aboard to their fate. She told Italian weekly Oggi that Schettino told her to follow him up to the deck. She said: 'We went up on bridge 11. Schettino has said that he was going to look at the condition of the ship, but really we were there to wait for a helicopter to take us away.' Tragedy: The giant cruise ship hit rocks and sank off the Mediterranean island of Giglio, killing 32 people, in Italy's worst maritime catastrophe since World War II . She claimed: 'While on board hell was unleashed, and dozens of people lost their lives, a quick and painless exit had been arranged for the privileged few.' The Moldovan dancer, who has admitted having an affair with Schettino, 52, issued an ultimatum to her former lover, last week on her Facebook. She wrote on September 23: 'Francesco Schettino I give you six days to tell the truth about what happened immediately after you gave the command to abandon ship. Just six days!' In the interview she said did not understand why he had told her to accompany him to deck 11 to inspect the ship, rather than one of his colleagues. But when they reached the top she began to get a better idea. 'The commander looked impatient, kept looking around, as if waiting for something. At one point he said, ""But here nobody can see us.""' 'Godlike': Last year, Miss Cemortan told how skipper Schettino, pictured returning to the Giglio harbour in February, was 'like a god on the ship' It was obvious that they were waiting for a helicopter she said, adding: 'Later I asked him if he interrupted a helicopter was coming, but he said that the plans had changed and we had to go back down to the lower decks.' Last year, Miss Cemortan told how skipper Schettino was 'like a god on the ship'. She first met him while working as a translator for Russian passengers on the Concordia. But they soon began an affair. 'It started during my second week on board,' she told Italian gossip magazine Oggi. She would sneak into the captain’s cabin at the end of her shift, usually in the early hours of the morning. 'There weren’t many people around at that time. Nearly everyone was asleep. You could take a bit more of a risk. I kept the affair secret in order to protect myself, as well as the captain.' A month later she returned to the ship as his personal guest. On the night of the shipwreck Miss Cemortan had dinner with the captain and was then invited up onto the bridge to see the Concordia pass close to Giglio in an ill-fated 'salute' to the island. Minutes later the ship hit rocks.","Domnica Cemortan claims Francesco Schettino arranged to flee the ship .

"An Oklahoma man who allegedly tried to hire a former co-worker to kill his pregnant girlfriend by poisoning her with ricin is set to stand trial. Preston Rhoads, 31, reportedly asked his friend to take part in a series of plots to poison the unnamed woman and her unborn fetus with the deadly toxin at their home in Oklahoma City. These included acting as a pizza delivery person and sprinkling ricin on a pizza, and dissolving the substance in a can of soda before handing it to the victim. Today, Rhoads waived his preliminary hearing in Oklahoma County District Court on two counts of solicitation to commit murder and attempting to kill another person.

Rhoads allegedly told his former co-worker in April that he had extracted ricin from the seeds of a castor bean plant after downloading a poison manual from the internet. He then referenced the hit U.S. crime drama Breaking Bad, before showing his friend a vial of the toxic substance, according to an affidavit cited by News 9.

"A controversial ad campaign which says 'hold your breath for six minutes' has been removed and updated amid concerns it promotes an unsafe message to children. To promote the current Dugong exhibition, the Sydney's Sea Aquarium ran a campaign, which included posters, featuring a picture of a Dugong and beside it a young girl holding her breath. It read,' Do like a Dugong: Hold your breath for six minutes'. But the message, although not meant to be taken literally, has sparked worried feedback that continuous breath-holding has been linked to the deaths of Australian children called shallow water blackout. SCROLL DOWN TO VIDEO . This is the controversial ad by the Sydney's Sea Aquarium which sparked concerns for promoting an unsafe message to children . Jack McMillan (pictured with his parents George and Michele) died in January last year from shallow water blackout . Jack McMillan, a healthy 12 year old died from shallow water blackout and now his parents are trying to make aware the dangers of children holding their breath underwater . The family of 12 year old Jack McMillan, who couldn't be revived after he was the victim of shallow water blackout near Wollongong, in January last year, spoke out on 60 Minutes about the dangers of children holding their breath underwater. 'He loved being in the pool, he'd just do lap after lap after lap,' Jack's mother Michele told 60 Minutes. 'He was holding his breath and challenging himself to see how many laps can I do.' Michele jumped in the pool to try and tried to resuscitate him but she couldn't and he died. The tragedy has prompted the family to raise awareness about the deadly and little known condition, which kills four times faster than drowning. Nic Fisher was another healthy young boy who also died of similar circumstances in 2001. His sister, Carly, wrote to Mamamia about the day her brother died. 'I returned home to find my 12 year-old brother Nic’s lifeless body, lying beside the pool,' she said. 'My dad and my aunty were performing CPR.' 12 year old Nic Fisher (pictured) died in 2001 also believed to be from shallow water blackout . There were concerns this poster promoted an unsafe message to children so the entire campaign by Sydney's Sea Aquarium was removed and updated . Shallow water blackout (SWB) is caused by competitive or continuous breath holding or by taking several deep breaths before diving under water . She told Mamamia, Shallow water blackout (SWB) is caused by competitive or continuous breath holding or by taking several deep breaths before diving under water. 'Swimmers pass out due to lack of oxygen and the delayed trigger to breathe means that water quickly fills the lungs.' 'This is how my little brother, a competent swimmer, water skier and healthy young kid, being supervised by two adults, was able to drown so quickly,' she said. A change.org petition last month, which has now closed, called on the aquarium to 'pull down the misleading poster'. 'When the motive of the poster seems to tell children that Dugongs can hold their breath for six minutes, it is undoubtedly very misleading. It is very much accident prone,' said the petition's founder Bulson Lamgade. 'What if, out of excitement and imitation, our children tend to hold their breath for 6 minutes? What can be more fatal and disastrous than this?' Jack McMillan (pictured) was a victim of shallow water blackout . The Sydney's Sea Life Campaign was removed and updated after concerns rose it was promoting an unsafe message to kids, asking them to hold their breath underwater for 6 minutes, like a Dugong . 'Please join me in asking the Sea Life Sydney Aquarium to pull down their poster and not misguide our children.' A spokesperson for the Sea Life Sydney campaign said 'this specific advertisement is a part of a larger campaign, which is certainly not intended to encourage children to take any of the comparisons with the Dugongs literally, including the holding of one's breath for any period of time.' 'The campaign is rather intended for adults and children alike to interpret the comparisons of humans to Dugongs as a fun way to learn about the anatomy, personalities and quirks of our famous Dugongs, Pig and Wuru.' 'However, we do acknowledge this is a real issue and so have taken the steps to ensure our campaign doesn’t contribute further to it.' 'We have updated and removed this particular part of the ad campaign from everywhere except on the bus panels, which we are endeavouring to remove as soon as possible,' she said.","A controversial ad campaign by Sydney's Sea Aquarium has been removed and updated .

"Just hours after the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling allowing same-sex marriage in five states Monday, a lesbian Virginia couple made history with their wedding being the first in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Erika Turner and Jennifer Melsop, of Centreville, (both 26 years old) married on the courthouse steps in Arlington, Virginia less than two hours after the courts began issuing licenses, the Associated Press reports. The two told ABC News that they had expected a long line of eager same-sex couples waiting to be married when they reached the courthouse. Immediately: Erika Turner (right) and Jennifer Melsop, of Centreville, (both 26 years old) married on the courthouse steps in Arlington, Virginia less than two hours after the courts began issuing licenses . Expectations: The couple said they expected a long line of eager same-sex couples waiting to be married when they reached the court house . Overwhelming: The newlyweds told ABC News that they didn't know they were the first to be married following the Supreme Courts ruling and it was 'a little overwhelming' Instead, the couple was met with television cameras, same-sex advocates offering to pay their marriage license fee, and the minister of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Arlington offering to perform the ceremony, according to the Associated Press. Cameras flashed as the couple each held a red rose given to them by a circuit court clerk and said their 'I dos.' 'Dearly beloved we have gathered together to join this woman and this woman in the holy state of matrimony,' the minister said as the ceremony began. '...You are changing history. Your families are coming together and the course of the world will be different because you now are a new family.' Kiss the bride: The two exchanged rings before being announced 'wife and wife' and sharing a kiss . Opportunity: Turner told reporters that she and Melsop had been trying to get married in other states but couldn't pass up the opportunity to get married in their own . Engagement: Tuner (a registered nurse) proposed marriage to Melsop (a veterinarian's assistant) a year ago . With jitters, the two exchanged rings before being announced 'wife and wife' and sharing a kiss. The newlyweds told ABC News that they didn't know they were the first to be married following the Supreme Courts ruling and it was 'a little overwhelming.' Tuner (a registered nurse) told USA that she proposed marriage to Melsop (a veterinarian's assistant) a year ago. 'We've been trying to figure out how to plan a wedding in other states,' Turner told reporters after the ceremony. 'So we can't pass up an opportunity to marry in our own state.' USA Today reports that the when the Supreme Court made its ruling Monday, officials decided to hold a press conference at the courthouse. Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring reportedly described the decision as 'a tremendous moment in Virginia history.' This wedding has been among the first of many since the Supreme Court ruled Monday to let stand rulings allowing same-sex marriage in Virginia, Utah, Oklahoma, Indiana and Wisconsin. The high court's refusal -- without explanation -- to hear gay marriage appeals left standing rulings that legalize the practice. This decision, though it immediately effected the five states, will most likely go on to include Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina -- bringing the total number of states where gay couples may marry to 30, The Washington Post reports. I do: Cameras flashed as the couple each held a red rose given to them by a circuit court clerk and said their 'I dos' Reuters reports that Evan Wolfson, head of the Freedom to Marry group, said that though the Supreme Court's action was a productive step in the gay marriage movement, gay rights advocates want the court to provide a more definite ruling. 'The Supreme Court should bring the country to a nationwide resolution,' Wolfson said.

"Killer Olympian Oscar Pistorius cried himself to sleep on the first night of his five-year jail term for shooting dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. The 27-year-old star was taken to the Kgosi Mampuru prison in Pretoria to serve his jail term. Wearing an orange jump-suit, sources claimed that Pistorius wept when he was placed in his cell until falling asleep. Pistorius is expected to serve just ten months of his five-year jail term. Scroll down for video . Prison sources claimed Oscar Pistorius, pictured, cried himself to sleep on the first night of his jail term . A jail source told The Citizen: 'You could hear him. Shortly after the door closed you could hear the tears … he was torn up. Broken. The crying went on and on. We think he stopped when he fell asleep. It was really bad.' Another source said he was being monitored constantly. The Correctional Services department refused to comment on the claims. Department spokesman Manelisi Wolea said: 'We have never given a blow-by-blow account of how an offender is progressing on a day to day basis. 'We have never done that for other offenders and we won’t do that for him.' The Paralympic gold medallist is undergoing a 36-hour 'comprehensive needs assessment' and orientation programme to inform him of the strict rules and regulations as a 'B' group inmate at the Kgosi Mampuru prison. He is starting a five-year sentence for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp – but could be out just ten months. His first night behind bars came as the model's parents told how they do 'not feel that justice has been done' but insisted they 'have to accept' the sentence imposed by the judge. Mr Morwane said: 'Once we have processed the inmate properly, we can draw up a ""sentence plan"" for him and make him aware of what programmes are available to him. 'I think he did get some rest over night and he looked to me like he was coping with his new situation. 'He has everything he needs. 'Upon arrival yesterday, all of his belongings were taken from him for safe-keeping until his release and he was allocated a cell, sheets, blanket, pillow, toothpaste and toilet paper.' Pistorius was taken to the tough Kgosi Mampuru prison in Pretoria, pictured, to serve his five-year jail term . The prison suffers from overcrowding and gang violence so Pistorius is being kept in the hospital wing . The hospital wing at the Kgosi Mampuru facility is heavily guarded round the clock and staffed by two trained nurses. The double-amputee's 'B' group classification entitles him to keep a small number of personal photographs in his cell, have two 'no-contact' visits at weekends and on public holidays – with a maximum of 45 visits per year. Once he has served six months of his sentence and proved himself to be a co-operative prisoner, Pistorius could be elevated to group 'A' - which would entitle him to more visits and and enjoy special privileges such as chocolate and Coca-Cola. The disgraced sprinter is one of nine disabled offenders, out of a total number of 7217, being held in the prison, which was formerly known as Pretoria Central and was notorious under apartheid rule for its brutal treatment of political prisoners. Pistorius is undergoing a 36-hour assessment by prison staff to determine if he is a suicide risk . The kingpin of one of its notorious 'numbers gangs' has already threatened to order 'a hit' on Pistorius if he is shown preferential treatment. Khalil Subjee, who is known as The General, leads the feared 26s gang which rewards acts of violence with promotion within the gang hierarchy. Mr Morwane insisted the prison's most famous inmate would 'certainly not' enjoy any special treatment during his incarceration. Pistorius was found guilty of the culpable homicide of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, pictured . 'Every prisoner receives the same treatment here, Mr Pistorius will be no different.' Nevertheless, the South African runner was taken unshackled and alone from Pretoria's high court to the jail in an armoured police vehicle, with armed outriders. Remand and newly-sentenced inmates appearing at the court are usually transported together in the back of a large prison van. The athlete's legal team had argued that prison posed 'a danger' to him because of his disability and fragile mental state. But Judge Thokozile Masipa said she believed Pistorius's disability had been 'over-emphasised' and his 'excellent coping skills' would equip him to adapt to life behind bars.","Paralympian cried himself to sleep on the first night of his prison term .

"A man who punched his friend to death because he had 'poked' his girlfriend on Facebook has been jailed. Scott Humphrey repeatedly punched Richard Rovetto after the pair had an argument in a taxi on the way home from a stag do in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. The fight broke out when Humphrey, 27, accused Mr Rovetto of contacting his girlfriend, saying that he had 'poked' her on Facebook. Fatal: Scott Humphrey, left, repeatedly punched father-of-one Richard Rovetto after the pair had a row in a taxi on the way home from a stag do in Manchester. He accused Mr Rovetto of contacting his girlfriend online . Nottingham Crown Court heard that Humphrey asked the father-of-one: 'If you're such a good friend why did you poke my missus?' Sending someone a virtual 'poke' on the social networking site is often seen as a way of flirting with them. Prosecutor Gareth Gimson told the hearing that the argument came to a head as the taxi stopped in Top Valley, Nottingham. He said Humphrey struck 29-year-old Mr Rovetto, causing him to bleed from the nose, before delivering another blow which knocked his friend to floor and caused him to bang his head on the pavement. Mr Rovetto, of Arnold, Nottingham, suffered severe head injuries and died in hospital hours later. Humphrey fled the scene but later handed himself in to police. The court heard that the friends had enjoyed a stag do in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire before falling out. Mr Gimson said: 'The taxi driver recalls Scott Humphrey accusing Richard Rovetto of contacting his girlfriend in the past and doing so via Facebook. The expression used is a ""poke"". 'Scott Humphrey said to Richard Rovetto, ""If you're such a good friend then why did you poke my missus?"" 'Richard Rovetto said he didn't know it was his girlfriend. The exchange became more heated.' Humphrey, from Nottingham, admitted manslaughter and was jailed for four years and four months. Judge Gregory Dickinson QC, sentencing, told him: 'When you and him went out that evening, violence and death were the furthest things from your mind. 'You didn't intend to kill him. Part of the tragedy is that it's left to chance what happens. 'There will be a fight like this somewhere tonight and the person will get up and go home and the police will never hear about it.' Jailed: Judge Gregory Dickinson QC sentenced Humphrey to four years and four months in jail after he admitted manslaughter during a hearing at Nottingham Crown Court, pictured. (File image) Robert Egbuna, defending, said: 'The defendant is genuinely remorseful about his actions. He will never forget that day. 'As soon as Scott Humphrey heard about what had happened to Richard Rovetto, he was devastated. He has been very candid and admitted this offence from the very start.' Speaking after the hearing, Mr Rovetto's brother-in-law Jason Burley-Evans, 42, said: 'This was a waste of a life. We feel the sentence wasn't the justice we wanted for Richard. He was a much-loved person and it will be hard for us all to move on.'","Scott Humphrey repeatedly punched Richard Rovetto after row in taxi .

"Travel back in time and experience life from more than 100 years ago. From horse-carriages, typewriters to women playing tennis in long gowns, the captivating  scenes of never-before-seen photographs of Brisbane has uncovered the forgotten moments of time. Published in a new book, titled Lost Brisbane and surrounding areas 1860-1960, the collection of photographs highlights the historical changes in landscapes, streetscapes, work places, transport, fashion and recreational pursuits. It's a world for the most avid historical fans, especially for the older generations who can remember their first tram ride or the day when colour television was introduced in Australia. Queen Street, 1953: Until the late 1960s, trams ran along the entire length of Queen Street and cars could be parked in the main street of Brisbane. Buildings on the left included Christies Café, Tattersall’s Club, Bayards, His Majesty’s Theatre, Wintergarden Theatre (WGT), and T&G Mutual Life Society Building . The idea came to light when QBD The Bookstore director Steve Robinson was inspired during his travels in the UK when he stumbled across the ‘Lost London’ book at the London Book Fair. The book illustrates a journey through time, from Spring Hill’s Wickham Terrace, featuring the city’s stunning landmarks, which prompted Robinson to pitch the idea to The Royal Historical Society of Queensland for a Brisbane version. ‘I grew up in southeast Queensland and am passionate about the region,’ Robinson told the Courier Mail. ‘Because QBD is a family-owned business it is possible to do this kind of project.’ Tennis in the Botanic Gardens, 1894: Tennis has always been a popular recreational activity. This photograph shows a foursome alongside the courts in the shadow of the Queensland Club on the corner of George and Alice Streets. The ladies wore long gowns while the men had their usual attire, no doubt giving them great freedom of movement . Clan MacGillivray troopship A46 at Pinkenba Wharf, c.1916: Family members are farewelling troops leaving Pinkenba on board A46  in about 1916. On the voyage a member of the 3rd reinforcements of the 41st battalion produced a magazine ‘MacGillivray Magster’. The ship had been launched in June 1911 and completed by Sir WG Armstrong, Whitworth & Co. Ltd, at Newcastle-on-Tyne for Clan Line Steamers . Arch built to welcome the Duke and Duchess of York, May 1901: This is one side of the massive four-faced triumphal arch erected at the intersection of George and Queen Streets. The arch was ornamented with portraits of the royal visitors and other imperial figures,  electric light at night and decorated with Queensland products. Lower arch inscribed the words - ‘Made glorious summer by this sun of York’ Despite Brisbane’s hilly terrain, which made it difficult for transport systems to develop, residents still enjoyed picturesque views of their town. Governors, politicians, pastoralists and businessmen built large homes on the slopes above the beach to enjoy the sea breezes and views to the bay islands, followed by hotels and boarding houses. Family members were pictured farewelling troops as they boarded the ship to fight in Gallipoli, while another photograph captures the 1890 flood at the intersection of Melbourne and Grey Streets. Pineapple Plantation showing irrigation layout, Moggill, 1949: In the 1940-50s pineapple growing was well established in the Moggill area. William Westaway was one of the first in the district to grow the smooth leaf pineapple in commercial quantities. In 1919 he sold his pineapple farm to HB Alpin. The pineapple farms continued to flourish until they were eventually overtaken by suburban development . King Sandy: Young man, King Sandy (‘Ker-Walli’) is wearing a breast plate inscribed with his name. A photograph of him as an elderly man gave his location as Toorbal Point and Ningi Ningi north of Brisbane as his tribal group. King Sandy was among 25 Aboriginals, who accompanied Tom Petrie in 1862 to the Mooloolah and Maroochy Rivers’ area to mark out cedar trees for the timber industry . Greenmount Beach, Coolangatta, January 1956: Large crowds enjoy the Christmas holidays . One major feature that is now lost in central Brisbane was the extent of factories and industry adjacent to and in the midst of retail and residential buildings. Not only does the book illustrate the buildings and places that no longer exist, the photographs record the everyday life of the city and how the landscapes of the development and changes during the black and white era. According to the Courier Mail, Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast was included to the book because Robinson believed the destinations were strongly tied to Brisbane. ‘I really wanted it to be about south east Queensland and not just Brisbane, because growing up in Brisbane, we all experienced south east Queensland as a whole – the places Brisbane people found iconic,’ Robinson told the Courier Mail. Collaborated by The Royal Historical Society of Queensland and QBD The Bookshop, more than 500 photographs from the Society’s Photographic Collection are printed in the book. Lost Brisbane and surrounding areas 1860-1960 is on sale at QBD The Bookshop at a retail price of $30 . Government Statistician’s Office, Treasury Building, October 1949: These typists are working in the equivalent of modern-day ‘work stations’. When women first began to work in offices in America in the 1880s it was frowned upon. One researcher wrote that ‘working among men, machines, and money was felt to diminish a woman’s innate sensitivity and moral superiority’ Lower Esplanade, Sandgate, 1889: Located on Bramble Bay, not far north of the Brisbane River mouth. Governors, politicians, pastoralists and businessmen built large homes on the slopes above the beach to enjoy the sea breezes and views to the bay islands . The Story Bridge, Kangaroo Point: Construction of the Story Bridge began on 24 May 1935. Queensland Premier, William Forgan Smith, is turning the first sod. JJ Bradfield, designer of the bridge, is holding the flag . Brisbane General Strike, Albert Square, 1912: The strike began on 18 January 1912 when members of the Australian Tramway Employees Association were dismissed for disobeying a government order prohibiting the wearing of union badges to work. They marched to Brisbane Trades Hall where a meeting was held . Queen and Edward Streets intersection towards the river and North Quay, 1860: The tall building on the right at the top of the rise was constructed in 1827-28 as the Prisoners’ Barracks. It later became the Parliament and Court buildings and was demolished in 1881 . Intersection of Stanley Street, Vulture Street and Dock Street, South Brisbane, c.1887-89: The photo shows a horse-drawn omnibus and horse-drawn tram with a tip horse which is an accompanying third horse to assist on the hill. The building on the left was South Brisbane School of Arts. It housed the Post and Telegraph Office, from 1881, South Brisbane Library, from 1897 and City Concert Hall, from 1902 . Ploughing George Street towards Roma Street, 1890s: Chamberlain and Wyllie tendered to put down wooden blocking for the length of Queen Street and George Street from Queen to Roma Streets. The contract was too big for them and George Charles Willcocks took over. Two plough teams were used each operating 12 powerful horses. Four drivers were required and three men to hold and guide the plough . Looking up Queen Street towards the Victoria Bridge, 1893: On the right is the New Zealand Insurance building and further along, Muir and Morcom Printers . Central Railway Station taken from the People’s Palace looking north along Ann Street in 1918: The double-storey station with arched roof covering the platforms was constructed between 1899 and 1901 by Phippard Brothers at a cost of £42,163. Work commenced on 22 November 1966 on the demolition of the arched roof as part of a long-term rebuilding program for a new railway administration block . Corner of Queen and Edward Streets, 1940: The AMP Society replaced the three-storey building on this corner with one of 10 levels constructed between 1930 and 1934. It was renamed MacArthur Chambers after US General Douglas MacArthur who established his headquarters there during World War II . The intersection of Melbourne and Grey streets during the March 1890 flood: On the right is the Terminus Hotel built in the late 1880s by Owen Hayes; it was rebuilt after a fire in the 1920s. The Fox Hotel is now on the site. Opposite the hotel is the South Brisbane Post and Telegraph Office. Mrs Maunsell’s Boarding house, Woodmere House is on the Grey Street Corner . The Story Bridge, 5 March 1941: Toll gates can be seen at the bridge’s southern approach. Although an engineering success, the bridge was regarded initially as a white elephant, the toll being unpopular and the traffic demand negligible. In 1947 the bridge was transferred to the Brisbane City Council and the toll removed. The bridge allowed direct access from the southern suburbs to Valley department stores . Norman Creek Bridge, 1886: The creek’s name is said to date from the early years of the Moreton Bay Settlement when Norman, a lime maker, lived near its banks. The bridge pictured was referred to as the first bridge and was constructed in 1885.The homes on the right were occupied successively by the Brabson, Pointon and Beattie families. Further on was the Harding’s house and then Weir’s dairy . Coronation Drive, 1950: By the 1860s, the road was a dirt track known as Mogg-hill Road and later as Moggill Road. It ran from Brisbane town along the river to Toowong and continued to the ferry at Moggill. The track originally carried timber for Patterson’s Brookfield sawmill which later relocated to Toowong. The track between Toowong and Moggill retained the name Moggill Road .

"It has long been a much-loved staple of the British breakfast. But bacon has been given a healthy makeover – and for many, the results are… well, a little fishy. Salmon bacon, which has proved a hit in Canada, Hong Kong and the home of traditional bacon, Denmark, is set to be launched in UK supermarkets and restaurants. Scroll down for video . The unconventional salmon bacon rashers will be launched across UK supermarkets after proving popular overseas . As well as being the perfect solution for non-meat eaters or those following a halal or kosher diet, its makers say it is also a healthier alternative, containing nearly 100 calories fewer per serving than traditional bacon. Makers MacKnight claims it ‘eats and tastes better than traditional smoked bacon’. However, a survey by The Mail on Sunday revealed some shoppers will be loath to give up their bacon sandwiches any time soon. None of the 12 who took part in a ‘blind’ test thought the rashers were real bacon. A 6oz (170g) pack with six rashers will cost £3, making it the same price as supermarkets’ own brands, such as Sainsbury’s Taste The Difference 7.7oz (220g) pack of six Oak Smoked rashers, which costs £3.30. However, the salmon contains 192 calories per 100g compared with 275 in the pork bacon. None of the 12 people who took part in a survey said they would swap their bacon sandwich for the salmon alternative . Sous chef Jerome Davidson, 34, from Wembley, North-West London, said: ‘You can taste the smoky flavour. It’s similar to bacon and there’s no fat, so it will catch on.’ However, Chris Newton, a retired teacher from Islington, North London, was scathing: ‘It looks horrible and tastes like anchovies. I’d never buy it.’ Others liked it – but said it could never replace real bacon. Alfie Grogan, 24, from Bermondsey, South-East London, added: ‘I’d eat salmon bacon, but for breakfast it must be real bacon.’ The Mail on Sunday’s food critic Tom Parker Bowles delivered a withering verdict: ‘The raw product isn’t bad. 'Slightly above average smoked salmon, cut to look like a rasher – if bacon slices suddenly turned a light orange and smelled of fish. ‘But the moment I threw it into a pan, it tensed and dried up, and started to resemble overcooked farmed salmon. It’s bland and dreary, and miles removed from bacon. Why bother going to all this trouble to sell smoked salmon as something that it’s not?’ Tony Ingham, of MacKnight, said: ‘It crisps like bacon, is as versatile, and makes a great breakfast bun with brown sauce. We’re convinced it is going to be a healthy lifestyle option – it’s high in omega 3 fatty acids that are good for the heart.’","Salmon bacon is described as a healthier alternative breakfast food .

"Gamblers at SkyCity Casino on Saturday night knew they were rolling the dice, but they probably didn't know they were playing Russian roulette with a lethal sea snake. Just after midnight, security at the Arafura seaside  casino called a local snake catcher to say they had found a 1.3 metre long yellow-lipped sea krait. The snake had already been partially stuffed in a lunch bag by security, meaning Phil Mangion had an easy job passing her onto Environmental scientist Mick Guinea, who completed his masters on sea kraits. Scroll down for video . The female yellow lipped sea snake appeared at SkyCity casino in Darwin just after midnight . Security called a local snake catcher associated with Parks and Wildlife, before partially catching the 1.3 metre long snake in a lunch bag . ‘It was thrilling. It’s always exciting when animals cross into uncharted territories. There is no breeding population for these snakes in Australia,’ Dr Guinea said. The serpent is native to Samoa, South India, Japan and Papua New Guinea. But Dr Guinea believes they could also be looking down under for new stomping grounds. ‘It’s very likely they could be naturally migrating. They have a very high range of habitats, and it could be that they are expanding this range.' ‘She probably arrived of her own stream, perhaps from some northern Indonesian islands like Aru, as the current sweeps from these areas up the northern coastline of Australia.' ‘Otherwise it’s possible, she could be a stowaway.’ They are the only sea snake to hatch their eggs on land, and Guinea says she was highly fertile when he found her.' The serpent is native to Samoa, South India, Japan and Papua New Guinea, but Dr Guinea believes they could also be looking down under for new stomping grounds . The serpent posed a threat to casino goers in SkyCity casino, having fangs as large as a death adder and 12 times the venom needed to kill a human . Snake specialist Mick Guinea says the sea krait could be naturally migrating to Australia . 'She had the potential to breed a colony. It's almost breeding season, and she was in great shape with a layer of fat and all of the conditions to have been carrying fertilised eggs.' Guinea says that since they breed almost exclusively on eels, they would not impede on the feeding of native Australian sea snakes. The serpent did however pose a threat to casino-goers, having 12 times the venom needed to kill a human, and fangs as large as a death adder. ‘They are a highly venomous snake. They are far more toxic than a taipan snake. The difference with many Australian snakes is that sea krait is very inoffensive. They have a placid personality and loathe to bite.’ Dr Guinea said he was excited to see whether there could be more sea kraits appearing in the future.","The female yellow lipped sea snake appeared at SkyCity casino in Darwin .

"The TV licence fee could be slashed by £50 under Tory plans which would stop short of scrapping the levy altogether. The idea is reportedly being pushed by senior Conservatives who want the £145.50 annual charge to be overhauled. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid has made clear the cost is 'a lot of money for some people' with some in the government calling for it to be done away with. Scroll down for video . The future of the TV licence is in doubt ahead of the BBC charter renewal due in 2016 . The BBC's royal charter, which agrees the way the corporation is run and funded, is up for renewal at the end of 2016. One unnamed minister told the Sunday Telegraph: 'There is a policy proposal going around to cut the licence fee by £50. 'The negotiation after the election will be very big. Some Cabinet ministers regard £50 as the minimum cut.' However a BBC source said: 'The BBC already has 25 per cent less to spend over this licence fee period and a reduction of a further £50 is equivalent to the loss of BBC One, Radio 1, Radio 2, Radio 3 and Radio 4.' The radical £50 plan is not thought to have the backing of Mr Javid who has so far refused to state what level he thinks the licence fee should be after the charter renewal. Last month he told the Mail: '£145.50 is a lot of money for some people. 'It's incumbent on all public bodies to be vigilant when spending other people's money, and the BBC is no exception to this.' A source at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport today stressed that money would remain tight at the corporation. 'We have to ask the BBC to do more for less,' the source added. Ministers are already examining whether not paying the licence fee should still be a criminal offence. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid was made clear the £145.50 fee is a lot of money for some people, but has not put a figure on the size of a cut he would like to see . Some 200,000 people a year end up in court accused of not buying a TV licence. They face fines of up to £1,000 and a criminal record - more than 50 a year go to prison. One possibility is to use new technology to cut off BBC channels for those who have not paid . John Whittingdale, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, told a party conference meeting this week that it was 'getting steadily harder to sustain the licence fee'. Rona Fairhead, the new chairman of the BBC Trust, started work in her new role last week with a warning to staff that of the 'need to operate efficiently'. Rona Fairhead has taken over from former cabinet minister Lord Patten who stood down in May. In an email to BBC staff, she said she had spent time with director-general Tony Hall and other senior executives in recent weeks. She said: 'They are under no illusions about the challenging environment; the changing viewing patterns, the explosion of choice and the rapid changes in technologies and markets. 'They understand that they need to operate efficiently and to rectify some of the high profile issues of the past, while building this compelling future.' The BBC was heavily criticised over excessive payouts given to senior staff including £470,000 to former director-general George Entwistle after only 54 days in the job and £680,000 to former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson. Deputy director general Mark Byford departed the BBC with a total payout of £949,000. The former chief executive of the Financial Times group also said she would 'defend vigorously the BBC's independence while holding it accountable to its audience'.","Dramatic cut of a third is one option being pushed by senior Conservatives .

"This pooch may be small in stature but proves size is no barrier to wreaking havoc on a party. As two men are getting an outdoor entertaining area in Limassol in Cyprus ready for a celebration, the puppy decided to get the games going early.

"The fiancee of slain graffiti artist and tattoo shop manager Christopher ‘Trigz’ Pebley has recounted how she rushed to him after finding out he had been shot, only to find his body lifeless slumped on the pavement. Honey Miranda had been ‘inseparable’ from the tattoo artist since they met in 2006, but is now having to face the prospect of raising their two-year-old daughter, Vida, alone after he was shot in the heart following an altercation in a North Hollywood smoke shop Thursday. Miranda exclusively told MailOnline: ‘I got the call around 5.45 that he had been shot. I raced down there and he was already gone. Scroll down for video . Gunned down: Graffiti artist and tattoo shop manager Trigz was shot dead in broad daylight outside a Hollywood smoke shop Thursday . In mourning: Honey Miranda, Christopher ‘Trigz’ Pebley's fiancee (pictured left and right), described the moment she found his lifeless body on the pavement . Personal tribute: Miranda honored her late fiance by getting his name tattooed on the back of her neck . ‘He was still there laying there, but he was dead. It was completely senseless. That person took one of the best people I’d ever known. Pebley was shot once following an altercation with an unidentified man in the Black Derby Smoke Shop, but Miranda, 34, said the couple’s day had been entirely ordinary until that point. She explained: ‘My daughter and I spent the day with him. He wanted us to run errands with him. He has his clothing line so he wanted us to go to Downtown LA to pick up some more shirts and sweatshirts to be printed. ‘So we went with him, and then we got food and came back here to the tattoo shop. Then the baby got tired and since we only took one car he took me home at around 2pm.’ Pebley is survived by his daughters Kristal, 23, and Jasmine, 14 as well as Vida and sons Anthony, 20, Michael Jr., 19. He was also stepfather to Honey’s daughters Ariana, 16, and Isabella, 13. Special bond: Pebley pictured with his youngest daughter, Vida, who know will never get to know her dad . Patriarch: Pebley had a 2-year-old daughter with his fiancee, and he is also survived by his sons, Anthony and Michael Jr, pictured right as children . Daddy's girls: The tattoo artist to the stars also has two older daughters from past relationships . Heartbreaking: Honey Miranda lamented that their daughter, Vida, is too young to remember how much her father loved her . Asked if she had a message for the killer, she said: ‘Just, I hope you rot in hell. You killed somebody that was the most amazing person ever and the best father ever and now my baby and his other four kids are left without him, but she’s so young she won’t even remember how much he loved her and that’s the part that killed me.’ Miranda had met Pebley in 2006 and they dated before he was sent to prison for graffiti offences in September 2007. She visited him in jail and they resumed their relationship when he was freed in 2011. Since then Pebley had worked on his screen career appearing in movies including SWAT and music videos for a variety of artists including Mobb Deep, Travis Barker, Blink 182, Yelawolf, Aerosmith, Taylor Swift. He had also appeared in documentaries aired on the National Geographic channel. Miranda said that many of her fiance’s famous friends have been contacting her to offer their condolences.

Distinct look: The heavily inked and pierced graffiti artist appeared in movies and music videos . Celebrity following: Trigz and friends with Chris Brown in an Instagram photo . ‘A lot of his friends have hit me up whether on social media or on my phone me. Travis Barker was a very close friend, we loved him, he was amazing, Snoop [Dogg], Chris Brown, they’ve passed their condolences and said they miss him, and that he was one of a kind.’ While a funeral and memorial service are still being planned, Miranda paid tribute to her late fiance by getting his name tattooed on the back of her neck Friday. She added: ‘I just finished getting a tattoo of him. I was actually supposed to get it yesterday with him, but it didn’t happen, so I came in today to get it. It’s his name on the back of my neck, then I’m going to get his portrait probably tomorrow [Saturday].’ Meanwhile, Pebley’s son Michael Hodges, 19, has said he is doing all he can to comfort his family in the wake of his father’s tragic death.

Honey Miranda discovered her fiance's lifeless body lying on the pavement outside this tattoo parlor . Makeshift memorial: Mourners have been bringing candles and other mementos to the crime scene . Familiar face: Actor Carlos Ayala, long-time friend of Trigz, was outside the smoke shop paying his respects . ‘I am going to try and fill my father’s shoes, but they are very big shoes. I wanted to step up and he would have wanted me to take care of my family,’ he told MailOnlne. ‘The whole incident sucks, but I knew right away that somebody had to take care of the family. ‘I just want to comfort them, calling them and checking on them every couple of hours and making sure they’re keeping their head up and having a straight mind. Hodges said he started a GoFundMe account to help their family, which he said raised nearly $17,000 in less than 18 hours. He added, ‘It’s amazing to see how many people have such a positive outlook on him and cared for him and his family.’ Rebel: Pebley (left) served four years in jail for graffiti-related offenses and regained his freedom only in 2011 . According to the manager of the Black Derby Smoke Shop, the chain of events that led the the fatal shooting started at around 5.40pm Thursday when a stranger made a passing remark that upset Pebley. The two men came to blows, and after about 30 seconds the fight spilled out onto the sidewalk and ended with the 'rude' smoke shop customer shooting the tattoo artist outside the Sin City tattoo parlor. Witnesses on the scene reported that the shooter then jumped into a white four-door Honda Accord and fled the scene. He was described as a Hispanic male in his 30s.","Christopher Pebley was shot in the heart in North Hollywood after a fight with a stranger .

"Ally McCoist's men celebrate 1-0 victory in Canada . Nicky Law on target with match winner on 37 minutes . Lewis Macloed steals the show with Man of the Match performance . Rangers rounded off their North American tour in the early hours of Thursday morning with their third win out of four matches in California and Canada. While their penultimate match, an uninspiring 2-1 win over Victoria Highlanders on Vancouver Island, had Ally McCoist lamenting his young second string’s display, out here in the Canadian capital another kid served yet more notice that he is indeed the real deal. Midfielder Lewis Macleod was simply sensational against Ottawa Fury, showing he is back to his best and fully over the virus that attacked his internal organs and ruled him out for the second half of last season. On target: Nicky Law scored the winning goal for Rangers on 37 minutes . Rangers (3-5-2): Bell (Simonsen 46); Mohsni, McCulloch, McGregor; Wallace, Macleod, Black (Hutton 73), Law, Gallagher (Smith 78); Miller, Boyd (Shiels 78). Subs not used: Kelly, Crawford, Murdoch, Templeton, Clark, McKay. Goals: Law (37).Attendance: 8643. Macleod spoke eloquently earlier this week about fearing his career was over but on this form he could go right to the very top of the game. The highlight of his excellent performance came midway through the first half when he set up Nicky Law’s only goal of the game with a neat pirouette move that could have come straight out of the Zinedine Zidane playbook. Overall, this was far more like it from McCoist’s men, after some stuttering performances out here against Ventura County Fusion, Sacramento Republic and Victoria Highlanders. Perhaps it helped that not only were Fury the best calibre of opposition Rangers have faced, this match was played out in a venue ideally suited for football, the impressive TD Place stadium. Happy days: Ally McCoist was pleased to see his side sign off from their pre-season tour with a win . Tight contest: Rangers star Lewis MacLeod is confronted by Ottawa's Phillipe Davis (left) and Tony Donatelli (right) It compared favourably with the spectacular fairground setting Rangers played in against Sacramento, and the low-key University campus fields that hosted Ventura County Fusion and Victoria Highlanders. And with a better standard of opposition, there was a lot more bite to this encounter. Fury, a team in the second tier of US soccer pyramid, below MLS, were captained by the former Dundee United midfielder Richie Ryan. On their bench was Nicki Paterson, a 29-year-old Scot, who played with Hamilton before quitting his homeland in 2005 to go to the University of Nevada in Las Vegas. With Richard Foster and Seb Faure out injured, the lack of a fit right-back saw McCoist go to a three at the back. Captain Lee McCulloch was placed between Bilel Mohsni and Darren McGregor. The central midfield three were Ian Black, Macleod and Law, with Lee Wallace and Calum Gallagher on either flank. Kris Boyd and Kenny Miller were the front pairing. The first noteworthy action of the first half action came when Macleod’s corner was headed against the bar by McCulloch. Then Fury’s Tony Donatelli crunched into Black with unnecessary force, earning a yellow card and prompting anger amongst the Rangers players. Off target: Kris Boyd was unable to get on the scoresheet during Rangers' latest match . Miller was chasing his first goal of the tour and should have scored but he failed to make a proper connection on Macleod’s fine ball across goal. Macleod was at the centre of every Rangers move of note and it was no surprise it was his sublime skill that set up Law to crack home superbly from 15 yards. Fury had a great chance of their own to level when Vini Dantas clearly fouled Mohsni before running through on substitute keeper Steve Simonsen, only to crack his shot past the far post. An apoplectic Mohsni had to be stopped by his own teammates from complaining to referee Mathieu Bourdeau about the lack of a whistle. In the second half, Law nearly grabbed a second after good work by Boyd but the former Motherwell midfielder fired wide. Then Rangers should have had a penalty when Omar Jarun handled a header by McCulloch. And there was another dodgy decision when an onside Miller was flagged offside after heading into the net a Black’s shot that spun up off Fury defender Jarun. That meant Miller drew a blank in four match out here, while Boyd also failed to notch and he was replaced by Dean Shiels for the final 11 minutes. But Rangers boss McCoist will have been relatively pleased with what he saw here against Fury. Rangers jet home to Scotland on Friday, before the build-up to the new Scottish Championship season continues with a friendly against Derby County at Pride Park on August 2. The new competitive campaign kicks off against Hibs in the Petrofac Challenge Cup three days later at Ibrox.","Ally McCoist's men celebrate 1-0 victory in Canada .

"Ally McCoist tipped Lee Wallace to become only the third Rangers star ever to be inducted into the club’s Hall of Fame while still an Ibrox player. The Scotland international left back opted to remain with Rangers after they lurched into administration in February 2012 and were then liquidated that summer. McCoist believes the 26-year-old’s loyalty, combined with his performances on the park while Rangers have travelled up the divisions, is destined for reward once the final stage of the journey is completed. Backing : Lee Wallace has had a boost from boss Ally McCoist . The Rangers boss is certain that Wallace will one day follow in the footsteps of former Rangers captain David Weir and current skipper Lee McCulloch in becoming Hall of Fame players while still pulling on a light blue jersey. ‘Lee Wallace has been fantastic for me,’ said McCoist. ‘Along with our captain, Lee McCulloch, he has been absolutely vital in giving us the stability on the park after administration and liquidation.‘We badly needed to have that stability, and I also count Neil Alexander (the former Rangers goalkeeper who is now at Hearts) in that, too. Stability: Wallace has been at Ibrox through thick and thin . ‘But the contributions of Wallace and McCulloch, in particular, have been so valuable over the past two seasons. And I fully expect it to be the same this coming season in the Scottish Championship. ‘It would be fantastic for those two boys to have on their CV that they went through the leagues as captain and vice-captain of Rangers. They have already shown great loyalty to stay here. And by going from playing at Annan and Elgin all the way back to the top flight in Scottish football? Well that would be a great story alright. ‘I look at the names of the Hall of Fame board as I walk up the marble staircase at Ibrox. I know McCulloch’s name is on it already, but, although I might be biased, I think Wallace is an absolute certainty to join him. And there would be no-one more deserving.’ McCoist also describe as ‘invaluable’ the contribution made by both Wallace and McCulloch off the park, in helping newcomers cope with the pressures of playing for Rangers. He said: ‘The most important aspect is on the park because you need to win games – and they have been outstanding for me. But it’s every aspect, really. ‘They’ve helped the guys who came into Rangers and, to be honest, didn’t know that much about the club. They’ve coaxed them through the difficult moments. Like when you are 3-0 up at Ibrox and you get the odd boo for a bad pass. ‘That can be tough to take for someone who does not know this club and its surroundings. 'So I simply cannot tell you how important Wallace and McCulloch have been for this club. ‘If I hadn’t had guys like that to call on, my job would have been so much harder. ‘They deserve an enormous amount of praise from the supporters and from ourselves as the management team for helping us through this period.’","Rangers boss is certain that Wallace will one day follow in the footsteps of former Rangers captain David Weir and current skipper Lee McCulloch .

"Cyle Warren Abbott Jr, 23, demanded cash from the gas station, but returned three hours later to apologise and hand himself in . A 23-year-old man robbed a gas station with a loaded BB gun before returning three hours later with the money to apologise, say police. Cyle Warren Abbott Jr from Eureka, California, demanded cash after entering the gas station brandishing what the clerk believed was a semi-automatic handgun, according to police. He was given a small, undisclosed amount of cash before he fled the scene at around 6am on Friday, taking with him two bottles of beer. Eureka Police Sergeant Steve Watson said Abbott told officers he needed cash to leave town for a fresh start, but then realised his mistake. Abbott returned three hours later and gave back most of the cash saying he was sorry. He told police the weapon he had used was a BB gun which he had thrown in a grassy area after leaving the station, but police have not found it. Police said he took officers to the spot where he tossed the gun, but it could not be located. Abbott was arrested on suspicion of robbery and a probation violation. He was booked into the Humboldt County Correctional Facility and his bail has been set at $50,000.

"Being a first time parent can be difficult, especially when trying to get to grips with a baby’s sleeping habits or behaviour. So with that in mind a device called the Sproutling Baby Monitor is set to be released. Using an anklet that attaches to a baby’s leg in tandem with an app, the device helps parents ensure their baby’s well-being by monitoring their movement, sound levels and more. A California-based company has released an ankle bracelet for babies (shown). Called Sproutling Baby Monitor it alerts parents to their child's well-being . The Sproutling Baby Monitor is comprised of three parts: a wearable band, a smart charger, and a mobile app. A waterproof wristband that tells people when they've been in the sun too long could help combat soaring skin cancer cases. The band changes colour from yellow to pink on UV exposure, warning people when to seek the shade before getting burnt. At £1 ($1.7) each, Scottish scientists developed it as a cheaper, more effective way of reducing rates of skin cancer. The wristband's sensitivity to ultraviolet light means it can alert the wearer to the danger before it is visible on the skin. The Smartsun monitor works through a significant colour change, created by an acid-release agent which detects ultraviolet light and a dye responding to pH levels in the indicator. Professor Andrew Mills and Dr Michael McFarlane developed the original invention while they were with Strathclyde University's Department of Pure and Applied Chemistry. The company is headquartered in San Francisco, California and the device will retail for £177 ($299) when it goes on sale at the end of 2015, although it is only available for pre-order now. The monitor gathers 16 different measurements every second to help parents understand things about their baby. The anklet syncs with an app to provide data to the parents, and multiple phones can be connected at once. For example the device can monitor the baby’s heart rate or detect when it is likely to wake up based on how restless it is. It can even determine what mood the baby is in when it wakes up, or if the room is too bright or hot for the baby to sleep comfortably. And if parents are watching TV in another room, the app will let them know if the volume is too loud and might disturb the baby. The £177 device (shown on baby, left) syncs with an app to tracks temperature (right), noise and motion . The device can tell parents if their child is too hot, restless or when they will wake up. The product is waterproof (straps shown in centre) and can be recharged wirelessly in a charging bowl (top right) ‘Parents have been relying on baby monitors for over 75 years and in that time, they fundamentally haven’t changed at all,’ said Sproutling co-founder Chris Bruce. ‘They continue to be a poor extension of parents’ eyes and ears and require constant attention to see if your baby is moving or making noise. ‘As parents ourselves, we wanted something that could tell us how our baby was doing when they weren’t moving or making noise and when we were unable to pay full attention, like when showering or sleeping. ‘We created the Sproutling Baby Monitor to be smarter and help parents be more effective - and we really hope our product will instill confidence in parents so they can grow happy families.’ The product was invented by a team of new parents and former engineers at Apple and Google, along with the help of child pediatric specialists and PhD scientists . The band is made from medical-grade, hypoallergenic silicone that is manufactured without chemicals or toxins. It’s also washing machine safe with a removable sensor. It can be wirelessly charged by dropping it into a supplied charging bowl, which doubles in utility as it also acts as the environmental sensor for the room. The app can even be shared with caregivers, like grandparents or the babysitter, so parents can keep an eye on things even when they aren’t at home. If the sound is too lout the app wil alert parents (left) while it also monitors when the baby will wake up (right)","California-based company it to release an ankle bracelet for babies .

"Witchmarks carved into a room in a historic house in preparation for a visit by King James I have been discovered by archaeologists. The superstitious carvings were made in the 17th century to protect the monarch from evil spirits and demons, which were thought to be rife following the Gunpowder Plot. The marks have been hidden for centuries in Knole House in Kent, and have only come to light as part of the National Trust’s work to conserve the building, which is one of Britain’s most important historic properties. Witchmarks (pictured) carved into a room in a historic house in preparation for a visit by King James I have been discovered by archaeologists investigating Knole House, in Kent . The witchmarks are scratched into beams and joists below the floorboards and fireplace surrounds in the Upper King’s Room of the palatial house. They comprise a collection of lines that act as a net to catch demons. Archaeologists from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola) dated the marks to early 1606 and the reign of King James I. A few months before the marks were engraved, the infamous Gunpowder Plot of 1605 had caused mass hysteria to sweep across the county and accusations of demonic forces and witches at work were rife. Experts believe that craftsmen working for then owner of Knole, Thomas Sackville, carved the marks in anticipation of a visit from King James I with the intention of protecting him from evil spirits. Archaeologists from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola) dated the marks found hidden under floorboards (pictured right) to early 1606 and the reign of King James I (illustrated with a painting by John de Criz the elder, left) The marks have been hidden for centuries in Knole House, Kent (pictured). They have come to light as part of the National Trust’s work to conserve the house, which is one of Britain’s most important historic properties . The witchmarks were carved in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot in a bid to protect King James I from evil spirits and demons. Also known as apotropaic marks, the carved intersecting lines and symbols found in the Upper King’s Room were thought to form a ‘demon trap’ warding off evil spirits and preventing demonic possessions. Apotropaic magic is a type of magic intended to 'turn away' harm and evil influences. The symbol fo the evil eye is an example. It is often practiced out of vague superstition or out of tradition. Also known as apotropaic marks, the carved intersecting lines and symbols found in the Upper King’s Room were thought to form a ‘demon trap’ warding off evil spirits and preventing demonic possessions. ‘King James I had a keen interest in witchcraft and passed a witchcraft law, making it an offence punishable by death and even wrote a book on the topic entitled Daemonologie,’ James Wright, a Mola buildings archaeologist explained. ‘These marks illustrate how fear governed the everyday lives of people living through the tumultuous years of the early 17th century. ‘To have precisely dated these apotropaic marks so closely to the time of the Gunpowder Plot, with the anticipated visit from the King, makes this a rare if not unique discovery.

The superstitious carvings were made in the 17th century to protect the monarch from evil spirits and demons, which were thought to be rife following the Gunpowder Plot.

Experts believe that craftsmen working for then owner of Knole, Thomas Sackville, carved the marks in anticipation of a visit from King James I with the intention of protecting him from evil spirits. They were found beneath the floorboards and hidden in the fireplace (pictured) in the Upper King's Room of the house . ‘Using archaeology to better understand the latent fears of the common man that were heightened by the Plot is extremely exciting and adds huge significance to our research about Knole and what was happening at that time,’ he added. Nathalie Cohen, National Trust archaeologist, said: ‘It’s wonderful to be able to piece together the forgotten stories of those who lived and worked at Knole and to share them with our visitors. ‘This is that once-in-a-lifetime chance to unravel the history of one of the largest houses in the country, from the rafters to the floorboards.’ Investigative work to learn more about the building and its past inhabitants will continue throughout the house until 2018. A series of behind the scenes tours are available on November 20 and 21 so that visitors can discover the witchmarks for themselves. People lived in fear of a Catholic rebellion and ghoulish goings on in the aftermath of Guy Fawkes' Gunpowder Plot. King James I had a reputation as an avid witch hunter and wrote a book called Demonology. Professor Ronald Hutton of the University of Bristol, told the BBC: 'It was a mandate for the British to fight witches.' People mused witchmarks and relied on other superstitions to protect them at the tumultuous time. In his book, James l wrote: 'Children, women and liars can be witnesses over high treason against God,' and this influenced the justice system when dealing with people accused of witchcraft. A nine-year-old beggar called Jennet Device helped convict 10 people of witchcraft in the 1612 Pendle witch trial in Lancashire, which led to their execution. She even denounced her mother as a witch, who had hosted a party on Good Friday when she should have been in Church. Her sister was accused of killing a pedlar after she cursed him and he collapsed. As a result of a family feud, most of the family were found guilty of causing death or harm by witchcraft and were hanged at Gallows Hill. The influence of the ambitious local magistrate, Roger Nowell, who passed the sentence, extended as far as the US, after the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, penned a best seller about the case, which was used as a reference handbook for magistrates. The book suggested seeking the testimony of children in trials of witchcraft, and at the notorious Salem witch trials in 1692, most of the evidence was given by children, leading to 19 people being hanged. The marks (pictured) illustrate how fear governed the everyday lives of people living through the tumultuous years of the early 17th century.

"Alex Salmond is being lined up for an explosive battle against Treasury chief Danny Alexander in next year's General Election. Sources claim the outgoing SNP leader could launch an audacious bid to steal the LibDem minister's seat and claim a senior coalition 'scalp'. The challenge would trigger a UK-wide media frenzy, force the LibDems to throw everything at the constituency and give Mr Salmond a chance to resurrect his political career after his defeat in the independence referendum. Scroll down for video . Outgoing SNP leader Alex Salmond could launch an audacious bid to steal Lib Dem minister Danny Alexander's seat and claim a senior coalition 'scalp' Mr Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is defending a large majority of 8,765 in Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, but the LibDem vote is expected to collapse in May's contest. Mr Salmond lives on the other side of the country in Strichen in Aberdeenshire, however he regularly holidays in a cottage near Inverness and plays golf at the world-renowned Castle Stuart course in the Highlands. The outgoing First Minister – who will hand over to Nicola Sturgeon next week - is expected to announce that he will launch a dramatic bid to return to Westminster within days. The Tories and LibDems have already placed their local parties in the Aberdeenshire seat of Gordon on a war-footing, as the Scottish Daily Mail exclusively revealed last month, with that seat still considered the most likely option by most observers. LibDem grandee Sir Malcolm Bruce is standing down and Gordon covers the Aberdeenshire East constituency represented by Mr Salmond at Holyrood. However, the LibDem candidate is a former journalist, Christine Jardine, who has no public profile. One senior Nationalist source said: 'Alex wants a scalp. He won't get that in Gordon and he has a pick of any seat.' Mr Salmond will officially hand over to Nicola Sturgeon next week, when she becomes SNP leader and First Minister . Ex-PM Gordon Brown would be drafted in for the general election if Jim Murphy becomes Scottish Labour leader . Gordon Brown is set to play a major campaigning role in next year's General Election if Jim Murphy wins the increasingly bitter Labour leadership battle. Mr Murphy yesterday revealed he has spoken to the former Prime Minister as the contest to replace Johann Lamont intensified. Today, his main rival Neil Findlay – a staunch left-winger – will launch his leadership bid with a thinly-veiled attack on career politicians. Many in the party wanted Gordon Brown to take control of Scottish Labour, but he declined to return to frontline politics. However, Mr Murphy said: 'I envision Gordon Brown having a big part to play. I spoke to him at length and I would like Gordon to have a big part in our election campaign. 'He was so formidable during the referendum campaign and I want him to use his energy and passion again for Scottish Labour. 'It will be for geeing up the troops but also for convincing voters. Labour has got to come together as a team because teams win whereas divided groups lose.' Mr Alexander would be an easy target as Mr Salmond could blame him for the Tory-LibDem austerity programme. Latest polls suggest the LibDems could be wiped out in nearly all their seats north of the Border, except Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael's Orkney and Shetland stronghold. However, a Scottish Liberal Democrat spokeswoman said: 'If the man who installed the hated average speed cameras on the A9, abolished Northern Constabulary and stood by the routine arming of police wants to run for a seat nearly 100 miles from his home, we think he should bring it on. People in Inverness deserve better than being someone's second best.' Mr Salmond is known to be fond of working in Westminster, and was an MP for Banff and Buchan for 23 years until 2010. He could return as the party's Westminster leader, replacing Angus Robertson who observers believe has already been sidelined. The SNP has not yet chosen its candidates for May's General Election. Mr Salmond will almost certainly not contest his old Banff and Buchan seat as it already represented by the party's Eilidh Whiteford. In Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, Mr Alexander's main challenge came from Labour in the 2010 General Election. But the Holyrood seat of Inverness and Nairn is represented by the SNP's Fergus Ewing, who won in 2011 with a massive majority of nearly 10,000, and Nationalist strategists believe they can therefore challenge Mr Alexander next May. The easier option for Mr Salmond would be Gordon, where the LibDems currently have a majority of 6,748 on a 36 per cent share of the vote. The SNP moved ahead of Labour and the Tories into second place in 2010, and in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, Mr Salmond was returned in Aberdeenshire East with a massive majority of 15,295. One LibDem source in the area said: 'We haven't heard anything officially, but we're expecting Salmond to make an announcement any day. 'But we're confident we can beat him – he's not as popular as he was in 2011 and the referendum saw a 60 per cent No vote in this area. People used to see him as invincible, but that's not the case now. 'He's something of a spent force.' During an episode of the BBC show Question Time last month, filmed in Liverpool, Mr Salmond was asked by presenter David Dimbleby whether he would consider a return to Westminster. The First Minister replied: 'The answer to your question David, absolutely decisively I can tell you I haven't made up my mind. So you'll have to wait and see. 'But I tell you what, when I do make up my mind, invite me back on to Question Time and I'll tell you why I did it.' Mr Dimbleby asked Mr Salmond: 'So it is not a closed door?' Mr Salmond replied: 'You can take that from what I have just told you David, that's right'.","Sources claim outgoing SNP leader could try to steal top Lib Dem's seat .

"The Navajo Nation is poised receive half a billion dollars from the federal government over mismanagement of tribal resources in the largest settlement of its kind for a single  tribe. The tribe has fought government legislation for decades for proper compensation for its people - many of whom live in abject poverty - after companies were allowed to use its lands. Much of the land on the 27,000-square-mile reservation - in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah - has been leased for  farming, grazing, oil and gas development, mining and housing. The leases once were largely overseen by the government, which mismanaged the revenue and failed to properly invest and account for it, according to the tribe. Scroll down for video .

The government has just agreed to pay the Navajo Nation a half a billion dollar settlement - which tribal members suggest should be set aside for future generations or used for business development . The accord will be formally signed at a ceremony on Friday in Window Rock, Arizona, the capital of the sprawling Navajo reservation. The tribe, which has a population of 250,000, agreed to settle the case earlier this year but was awaiting signatures from federal agencies before the $554 million deal could be finalized. The Navajo Nation originally sought $900 million when the lawsuit was filed in 2006. 'We had a strong claim,' said Navajo Nation Council Delegate Lorenzo Curley. Public meetings will be held to ask Navajos how they think the money should be spent, Curley said. The first meeting is scheduled for October. Already, tribal members have suggested that it be set aside for future generations or used for business development, he said. The deal does not preclude the tribe from pursuing future trust claims, or any separate claims over water and uranium pollution on its reservation, Navajo Attorney General Harrison Tsosie said. An investigation in 2012 found that 40 per cent of the tribe were living without electricity and running water.

The Navajo Nation - whose lands encompasses parts of Utah, Arizona and New Mexico - stretches across 27,000 square miles and is larger than ten American states. The land holds some of the U.S. most dramatic scenery including Monument Valley and Canyon de Chelly. In the beginning, the Navajo were hunters and gatherers who took up crop farming when they learned techniques from the native Pueblo people. A group of Navajo riders on horseback pass through a desert canyon in 1904 . Archaeological work has revealed that the Navajo and Apache peoples were present in the Southwest region of the U.S. from around 1400 AD. Navajos traded with the Pueblo community in the 16th century and then by the 18th century, the Spanish were reporting on Navajo farming communities. In 1846, the Navajo first made contact with the United States of America when General Stephen W. Kearny and his troops marched into Santa Fe during the Mexican-American War. A peace treaty was signed in 1846 but it was not honored on either side. In the next decade, the U.S. comandeered more and more of Navajo land, building forts and setting up trading posts. In 1861, a series of military campaigns started against the tribe including the scorched earth campaign - where U.S. troops killed Navajo men and women and burning their crops. Facing starvation or being killed, the Navajo surrendered and were imprisoned in 1863. From 1864, 9,000 Navajo people were forced into what is referred to as the 'Long Walk' - when the tribe were marched at gunpoint 300 miles from their original lands by the U.S. government to be interred at Bosque Redondo. The move was a catastrophic failure - there was not enough food and water for the thousands of Navajo and disease was rampant among the tribe. Finally two years, later a treat between Navajo leaders and the federal government allowing the surviving Navajo to return to a reservation on a portion of their former homeland. Andrew Sandler, one of the Navajo Nation's attorneys on the case, said the tribe has taken on much of the responsibility for leasing on its land. If further disputes arise with the federal government, the settlement outlines a process to resolve them. 'This was viewed as an appropriate and respectful settlement where the federal government acknowledged its responsibility and acted in an honorable way,' Sandler said.

Tribes across the country have filed more than 100 breach-of-trust cases against the U.S. government. The Navajo Nation settlement is the largest, exceeding the next highest amount by $170 million, Sandler said. The Interior Department said it is working to resolve cases with other tribes without going to trial. Since April 2012, the federal government has resolved about 80 cases, totaling $2.5 billion.

"Callers are being charged up to £5.68 just to get one number from Britain’s biggest directory inquiry service. The extraordinary cost is a result of sneak price hikes by all the main telecoms companies. Earlier this month BT, Sky and Virgin all quietly made huge increases to the minimum charge for calling the 118 118 service – taking it from £3.58 to £4.45. But TalkTalk went even further – increasing the minimum fee by 45 per cent from £3.92 to £5.68. Mobile phone companies have also introduced rises over the past year – meaning that from some networks, a 10-minute call to the 118 118 service, followed by a connection to a number, can cost as much as £50. Rip-off: The 118 118 runners and cost comparison for their services from landline providers . The charges fly in the face of promises made by the Government’s telecom watchdogs when the single 192 system, which cost 40p, was scrapped in 2003. At the time, the public was promised that competition would deliver low prices and better services. In reality, it has been a disaster – with foreign call centre workers confused by requests and customers feeling cheated by high prices. The number of calls to directory inquiries has fallen by an estimated 80 per cent in ten years. But while younger people switched to free internet services on smartphones and tablets, many elderly people still rely on directory inquiries. Citizens Advice Chief Executive Gillian Guy described the situation as unacceptable. ‘People without access to the internet, who are often elderly, are particularly at risk from this type of steep, hidden charge,’ she said. ‘In many cases people end up paying over the odds for what should be a local rate call after being transferred to another number by a directory service. One Citizens Advice client was stunned to find that he had a bill of more than £100 after calling a 118 service.’ The market is dominated by 118 118 – operated by a company called The Number – and BT’s 118 500. In April, 118 118 was fined £80,000 by watchdogs after some of its advertisements failed to warn customers about the high cost of using its service . Telecoms expert John Lewis, the managing director of Simunix, which runs its own service on 118 365, said rivals are pulling the wool over people’s eyes by failing to make their prices clear. He said the price of calling his service had remained virtually the same since 2003, except for an increase linked to the rise in VAT to 20 per cent, which took it to 51p. ‘The figures are scandalous,’ he said. ‘When the deregulation began it was always considered essential that prices should be displayed clearly wherever you show your number. But that has gone by the wayside. ‘We made a decision some time ago that we would hold the price of our 118 365 service at 50p per minute all the time we were not losing money on it.’ The income from the high charges is split between the firms providing the directory inquiry services and the landline or mobile phone networks customers are signed up to. The market is dominated by 118 118 – operated by a company called The Number – and BT’s 118 500. In April, 118 118 was fined £80,000 by watchdogs after some of its advertisements failed to warn customers about the high cost of using its service. Two months earlier, BT was fined £225,000 and ordered to pay refunds to customers over what was described as a ‘disgraceful’ directory inquiry rip-off. Tens of thousands of people are thought to have been overcharged because the firm failed to make call costs clear and kept them hanging on the line with rambling automated messages. In one case a customer calling its 118 500 number was charged £81, while one elderly person appears to have been charged as much as £454 over three months. BT, Sky and Virgin all blame rises on the service provider, while BT added that it took only a small fraction of the charge. TalkTalk also blamed 118 118, but was unable to explain why its minimum fee was so much higher. A spokesman for The Number, which runs 118 118, said only: ‘118 118 provides an extremely fast and highly accurate service valued by millions of people every year.’","BT, Sky and Virgin all blame rises on the service provider .

"As the sun sets on a mixed first season back at Chelsea for Jose Mourinho, the Portuguese boss will spend Monday delivering his report of the season to all-powerful owner Roman Abramovich. Sure to be in there are pleas for a new striker, men to get rid of and some things to improve for the next campaign. Here, Sportsmail goes inside the mind of Mourinho and imagines what’s in that dossier. Report: Jose Mourinho carries his secret dossier for Roman Abramovich in our mocked-up image . Rare sighting: Mourinho (left) is not often pictured next to Roman Abramovich (right) STAR MEN . John Terry I’ve got my 'JT' back. He’s been imperious at the back, finding his best form for five years. Your No 1 mission this summer, Roman, is to sign him up for another year – at least. Why on earth was that bloke leaving him out last season? Can’t remember his name… . Eden Hazard I’ve had to tell him off in recent weeks for not following the same rules that saw Juan Mata exiled from ‘the family’ – sorry about that, by the way – but when he pays attention he’s the best I’ve got. He needs to knuckle down and shine in the big games, but don’t worry, I’ll get him into line. Gary Cahill My most improved player. He’s been playing to a level no-one ever thought possible – that’s down to me, you know. And having JT next to him. But mostly me. He can be a future Chelsea captain. Up in the air: Eden Hazard (centre) is wanted by top clubs across Europe but remains Chelsea's star man . Head boys: John Terry (left) and Gary Cahill (right) should be part of Chelsea's future plans . MOVE THEM ON . Fernando Torres I know you don’t want to hear this, Roman, but spending £50million on this fella wasn’t one of your smartest moves. It’s been four pretty awful years, it’s time to move him on. Unfortunately your generosity means no-one else is going to pay his wages. David Luiz Barcelona are sniffing around him to the tune of £30m, and I wouldn’t mind getting my hands on that. Usurped by Cahill in defence, he turns up for the big games in midfield but is all-too-often a liability by switching off against the small fry. I’ll miss his tongue-sticking-out Instagram photos, though. Ramires You know I love a runner, but you need to be able to pass the ball as well – Ramires often has to be reminded that we play in blue. He’s also been suspended about as many times as Vinnie Jones in his heyday. Hmm… I wonder if Vin fancies a return to Stamford Bridge? Farewell, Fernando: It's time for Chelsea to cut their losses and ditch the misfiring Torres for good . We play in BLUE, Ramires: The Brazilian midfielder (left) is full of energy but wastes possession . I WANT . Diego Costa In case you haven’t noticed, I’ve been hinting all year that we might, just possibly, need a striker. If you’ve tuned in to La Liga at any point this season, you’ll probably have seen the Atletico Madrid man make defenders break out into cold sweats. I saw your face after his team knocked us out of the Champions League – we’ll both be smiling next year. Thibaut Courtois You’ll like this, Roman – you won’t even have to buy him! He’s one of your most valuable toys and someone else has been playing with him for three years. Let’s not break the news to Petr just yet, but I liked what I saw in the Champions League. A striker. Any striker at all. Mandzukic, Cavani, Ameobi… anyone will do. I know I’ve already said Costa, but we need another. I don’t fancy that big fella from Belgium that seems to come back every summer, and Samuel Eto’o is busy applying for his bus pass. Top priorities: Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa (left) and on-loan goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois (right) NEW SEASON RESOLUTIONS . 1 I’ll leave the bus in the car park. Everyone’s been telling me you want this attacking football malarkey, so I promise I’ll give it another go. I can’t guarantee I won’t batten down the hatches when the going gets tough, but get me a couple of strikers and watch us go… . 2 I’ll keep my trap shut. Frankly, it’s getting a bit expensive paying the FA thousands of pounds every time I speak about referees, so I’m going to keep my thoughts to myself. Probably. Wind-up: Mourinho got the better of Liverpool but still finished below Steven Gerrard's team in the table . Heart felt: Mourinho will make his pleas to Chelsea's all-powerful owner for changes this summer . 3 I’ll win a trophy. History tells me you’re not a big fan of managers without silverware and I couldn’t bear to move again after settling back in London. 4 I’ll beat some teams in the bottom half. I know you enjoyed beating Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City this year. If only we could use that expertise to beat the might of Aston Villa, Sunderland and Norwich we might be really on to something. Full of hot air: Jose Mourinho grabs a balloon on the touchline during the final game of the season at Cardiff . 5 I’ll smile a bit more. Having said I was the 'Happy One’ when I came back, I’ve had a bit of a sense of humour failure in the last few weeks.

"Out of England's World Cup squad, out of contract at Chelsea in the summer; but Ashley Cole will not be out of options. Cole has been the best left-back in the country for over a decade and, at times, arguably the best in world football. But what is the next move for the 33-year-old? Where next? Ashley Cole is resigned to leaving Chelsea this summer as his contract ends . Three World Cups, two European Championships, 107 England caps, three Premier League titles, seven FA Cups, a Champions League and Europa League trophy, one League Cup and three Community Shields. Wherever he goes, he'll need a separate removal van just for the silverware. Options in England appear more limited, but are not out of the question. With Luke Shaw set for a move to Manchester United, the only other viable clubs that could offer Cole the standard of football he would require to remain in this country are Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool. City aren't short of left-backs, Brendan Rodgers has shown faith in young English full-back Jon Flanagan, but Arsene Wenger could do with a replacement for the injury-prone Kieran Gibbs and the inconsistent Nacho Monreal. Would Cole really return to a club where fans dubbed him 'Cashley' when he moved to Chelsea for far bigger wages? Stranger transfers have happened in football. Finished: Cole retired from international football having been left out of England's World Cup squad . Happy days: Cole could be set for a return to Arsenal, who he left to join Chelsea . Cole has had a renaissance at the end of this season, starting in big games against Liverpool and Atletico Madrid, and Chelsea Manager Jose Mourinho did not rule out keeping Cole, along with veteran team-mates Frank Lampard and John Terry. ‘Was the Norwich game the last game for Cole, Lampard and Terry? I don’t think so,’ Mourinho said. Cole's reaction after that final game of the season at Stamford Bridge when he burst into tears suggested otherwise. And, after his eight-year association with the club, he might fancy pastures new. When his representatives negotiated . his latest deal last year, worth just under £200,000-per-week but . greatly dependant on bonuses which he is not getting sitting on the . bench, they held tentative talks with Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain . and Manchester United. On the continent: Real manager Carlo Ancelotti may move for the left-back having always been an admirer . Cole has considered the idea of moving abroad in the past. In his 2006 autobiography 'My Defence' he wrote: 'I’d entertained European thoughts. Ask any player with ambition; they’ll all do it from time to time. 'Nothing concrete, just tossing clubs around like a kid dreaming impossible dreams: Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus, Inter Milan.' Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelloti is fond of Cole and knows him well from his spell in charge of Chelsea from 2009-2011 when they won the league and FA Cup double in 2010. Ancelloti has spoken in the past about his admiration for the left-back's work ethic. Uncertain future: John Terry earned a new contract, but Cole and Frank Lampard are yet to receive an offer . Inter Milan are in the process of overhauling their squad after a terrible Serie A campaign, although Cole said in the same autobiography that he was not keen on a move to Italy. The MLS is becoming an increasingly attractive prospect to former stars heading into the twilight of their careers since the likes of David Beckham, Thierry Henry, Jermain Defoe, Rafael Marquez and Robbie Keane crossed the Atlantic. The New York Red Bulls and LA Galaxy are both understood to be interested and Mourinho hinted earlier in the season that Henry, a former team-mate of Cole at Arsenal, was trying to persuade him to make the move to New York. 'Maybe Thierry is doing with the Red Bulls the same as David [Beckham] did with Miami,' Mourinho said. '[Cole] has [a future at Chelsea], but maybe Thierry has a better proposal.'","Ashley Cole's contract is up at Chelsea, but he still has options .

"A 20-year-old student drowned in a river while more than three times over the drink-drive limit after spending the evening playing drinking games with friends, an inquest has heard. Megan Roberts, a student at York St John University, fell into the River Ouse while walking home from a fancy dress night in January, an inquest heard today. Police had launched a massive hunt for the student, from Wetherby, West Yorkshire, after she went missing earlier this year. Megan Roberts, a student at York St John University, fell into the River Ouse, York, while three times over the drink drive limit, an inquest has heard . The 20-year-old (pictured left and right) had been drinking cider, shots and spirits before she went missing in January and friends said they had never seen the fine art student so drunk . The banks of the river were searched and divers were used to try and find her, but police could find no trace. But a member of the public discovered Megan's body on the muddy river bank, five weeks after she disappeared. Today, an open verdict was recorded at an inquest into Megan's death, after a coroner said there was 'no evidence' to determine how she ended up in the water. But Home Office Pathologist Jennifer Bolton told the court the cause of death was drowning, with a contributing factor of the effects of alcohol. Blood tests revealed she had 273 milligrammes of alcohol in her body - three and a half times the legal limit for driving. Friends also told the inquest they had never seen Megan so drunk and had begged her to go home. During the inquest, the coroner was told how the fine art student had drunk four pints of cider and blackcurrant in the students' union bar at the start of a boxing club social on Wednesday, January 22. Megan had then taken a taxi to a nearby pub where she was seen downing Jagerbombs and cocktails. Afterwards, she went to Popworld nightclub where she continued to drink spirits. The inquest heard how Megan had gone to the students' union in York, as well as another bar, before finishing her night in popworld, pictured above . Many members of the group were downing triple vodkas during the evening and were dressed as superheroes, the court was told. Megan's best friend Victoria Rose Iveson told the inquest: 'Megan was more drunk than I had ever seen her before. She was really, really drunk. I kept saying she should go home. 'But she was saying she was not ready to go home yet.' Another friend Bethanie Robinson said: 'We were playing drinking games a group. When I got into the club I could see Megan was already in there. 'She seemed really happy. She appeared to be having a good night. If she had been in a worse state I would have looked after her.' Police had launched a massive hunt for the student, from Wetherby, West Yorkshire, after she went missing in January this year, pictured . The banks of the river were searched and divers were used to try and find her, but police could find no trace of her, pictured . After the nightclub, Megan was said to have left with some of the students to go to McDonald's in the city centre. She was later caught on CCTV looking worse for wear and walking into some cycle racks outside a pub, as the group made their way to Lendal Bridge over the River Ouse. Student Tony Atkin said he jogged down to the arch of the bridge to urinate and believed Megan may have followed him down to the river, but he did not know why. A figure which may have been Megan was later spotted staggering behind him as he jogged away, the court heard. Megan was never seen alive again and was reported missing on Monday - five days later - when she failed to turn up for lectures. Her body was found five weeks after she went missing by a passer-by . A fruitless police search led to public appeals for information about Megan. Her body was then spotted on the afternoon of March 2 by James Fearns while he was walking along the river bank with his wife and daughter  at Acastar Malbis, a marina a few miles outside York. Mr Fearns told the hearing how his wife spotted Megan's body and they phoned 999. Recording an open conclusion, Coroner Jonathan Leach said: 'Having consumed a large amount of alcohol by some means she entered the river. She probably fell in due to her senses being impaired. 'There is no evidence at all how she entered the river. In those circumstances, I'm left with no alternative but to enter an open conclusion.' The inquest was held on the same afternoon as that of Ben Clarkson, a York sales assistant, who also drowned in the river after consuming 263 milligrammes of alcohol. He was found drowned in the River Foss days later. There was also an open verdict in that case. Mr Leach added: 'I am holding both on the same day to raise awareness of the dangers of the River Ouse and Foss particularly to those who have drunk large amounts of alcohol. 'In both cases, it is a tragic end to both young lives.' After the hearing, Megan's mum Jackie said her message to other young drinkers was 'just bear in mind that awful tragedies can happen to nice people'. She added: 'They were just out having fun. It highlights the dangers. I'm glad it is over. I have been waiting a long time for this.' She had previously said in a statement: 'We would like to thank the police, fire service, and the public that have been involved in the search for Megan. 'We would also like to thank everyone who has offered support and comfort during this painful time. 'Megan was an intelligent, talented and beautiful person whose kindness and sense of humour will be greatly missed by everyone who knew and loved her.' The student's father Jason Roberts had also paid tribute to his daughter after her body was found, saying: 'We would like to thank the police, fire service and the public who have been involved in the search for Megan. 'Megan was a wonderful, kind and loving daughter who will be missed by many.'","Megan Roberts from Wetherby, West Yorkshire, went missing in January .

"A man was arrested on a drug charge after police were helped by his own dog. Police in Prattville, Alabama, were trying to serve a search warrant on Edwin Henderson when he fled into a ravine behind his house. One of the officers pointed at Henderson and told the dog 'go get him,' police spokeswoman Paula Barlo said. Police dog: Bo, pictured, followed his master who was on the run from police and wagged his tail so they could find and arrest him . Bo the dog then took off after his master. When the pet stopped and wagged his tail in tall grass, police found and arrested Henderson. Henderson is charged with failure to obey police, manufacturing a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia. It's unclear if he has an attorney, and there's no word on who's taking care of Bo.","Bo the dog followed his master when he ran away from police officers .

"The daredevil adventurer whose attempt to ‘run’ more than 1,000 miles from South Florida to Bermuda in an inflatable bubble had to be aborted after he got lost is extremely unhappy that his pod wasn’t rescued along with him. Endurance athlete Reza Baluchi, 42, was plucked from the ocean on Saturday morning but his Hydro Pod - a floating sphere, encased in a metal fame, that allowed him to run on water, like a hamster in a wheel - remains lost at sea. When Baluchi was rescued he was told a fisherman would haul his bubble back to shore, but  he’s since been informed that that wasn’t possible and so his bubble was left still floating at sea. Scroll down for video . Endurance athlete Reza Baluchi, 42, was plucked from the ocean on Saturday morning but his Hydro Pod remains lost at sea . That isn’t good news for Baluchi, who says his valuables were left inside the bubble - including his green card, passport, cellphone and even his shoes. To make matters worse, Baluchi had ploughed his entire life savings - some $4,500 - into designing and building the pod. Baluchi said he had been working two jobs, as a mechanic and restaurant dishwasher, in order to raise the funds for his adventure. ‘It took a long time,’ he told the Miami Herald. Time is now running out for him as the law of salvage in maritime law states that anyone who recovers another person's ship or cargo after peril or loss at sea is entitled to a reward equal to the value of the property. With no money or boat, the Iranian born U.S. citizen says he’ll needs help to get it back. 'I’m in trouble. Big trouble,' he said. The Coast Guard rescued Reza Baluchi from his Hydro Bubble 70 miles away from St. Augustine, Florida on Saturday morning . Baluchi was 70 nautical miles east of St. Augustine when he was rescued on Saturday. Coast guard officers had originally spotted him inside his bubble on Wednesday, but he had waved coast away guard, saying he was determined to complete his intended 1,033-mile journey. Baluchi was on his own. No supporters or boats followed, a common net for athletes attempting open water voyages. When the coast guard first discovered him on Wednesday, he was disoriented and asking for directions to Bermuda. His bubble was filled with protein bars and bottled water - though he had claimed before setting off that he would mostly survive by fishing. Worried by Baluchi's apparent state of exhaustion and lack of adequate supplies, the coast guard had asked him to end his mission, but he  refused. The coastguard continued to track him until Saturday morning when Baluchi activated his Personal Locating Beacon. After receiving his signal, an HC-130 airplane and a MH-60 helicopter were dispatched along with a rescue ship. Helicopter rescue: Once all of the aircrew arrived, a rescue swimmer got Baluchi from his inflatable raft and into a helicopter where he was later evaluated by medical crews and found to be uninjured . Once they arrived at his coordinates, a rescue swimmer had got Baluchi out of his inflatable and into a helicopter. He was evaluated by medics and judged to be 'fatigued' although not injured. The coastguard wanted him back to shore. 'He activated both his spot beacon, and personal locating beacon. That’s a distress call. When he activated those two things, he was calling for help,' said Petty Officer Mark Barney, a spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard. Baluchi disagrees. He said on Sunday that he didn’t turn on the beacon internationally, and had the energy to keep going. He said people thought he was disoriented because he was sleeping during the day and bubbling at night. Baluchi calculated that temperatures inside the bubble would top 120 degrees during the day, so for the four days he was at sea, he waited until nightfall to move forward. 'I never quit,' he said. 'It’s not me.' Baluchi says he ploughed his entire life savings - some $4,500 - into designing and building the pod . According to Baluchi's website, Bermuda was just one stop in Baluchi’s ambitious - if not impossible - mission to outline the Bermuda Triangle: a thousand miles to Bermuda, another thousand south to Puerto Rico and another thousand east, back to South Florida. 'Everyone wants to know how Reza Baluchi will be successful in his travel to through the Bermuda triangle. Reza is so confident that he will succeed in this trip because he has carefully articulated every detail it takes to survive,' he had written on his website. Baluchi had first tried to set off on his adventure last weekend, but his bubble was literally burst when some large children got into it when he wasn’t looking. The bubble’s weight limit is about 200 pounds . ‘There were kids on the beach. And they were jumping inside it,’ Baluchi said. 'I patched up the hole, and it was ready.' In the end, Baluchi set sail three days later, but he now says his mission is in limbo. 'I go around running, telling people, if you have a dream, you can do anything,' Baluchi said. 'Now I’m here, no money no bubble, no anything.' Baluchi left his valuables inside the bubble including his green card, passport, cellphone and even his shoes . Long Journey: Reza Baluchi was attempting to travel 1,033 miles from Florida to Bermuda . Baluchi claims he designed his Hydro Pod specifically to take him on his journey across the ocean. He said: 'Being inside the Hydro Pod is not going to be a walk in the park; it will be very hot and humid. One can easily dehydrate quickly and lose breath. 'Reza has devised this Hydro Pod to prevent physical difficulties. But not anyone can use without being mentally and physically fit. Being mentally fit is the main component to be able to survive a long journey in the Hydro Pod.' In 2013, Reza tested his Hydro Pod by taking it out from Newport Beach to Catalina Island. Next he wanted to cross the Bermuda Triangle because of the stories of shipwrecks and plane crashed linked to the area. The Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil's Triangle, is a region in the western part of the Atlantic in which an imaginary line is drawn from Miami to Bermuda to Puerto Rico. 1.The distance between Miami, Fl to Bermuda is approximately 1,033 miles one way. 2. The Hydro Pod is made of 3mm thick plastic. 3. Inside the Hydro Pod it will reach up 120 degrees Fahrenheit. 4. Reza is an excellent fisherman and will be catching his food on a daily basis. On those days that he is not be able to catch fish, he will he survive on his homemade protein bars. 5  He will need to manually pump his Hydro Pod for one hour to ensure that it will stay afloat. 6. At night the Hydro Pod will have a light emitting from the bottom to help with the travel. 7. Reza will rest in the early hours of the morning when the sea is calmest . 8. On a daily basis 400,000 ships sail through the Bermuda without harm or loss . 9.The frame is designed by Mr. Reza Baluchi. 10. A typical day will be, Reza will be sleeping from 6am-9am, will wake up to start running until his body becomes too hot, he will then jump into the sea to cool himself off with a leash strapped to his leg connected to the bubble. 11.He will sleep on a hammock that will be inside the bubble. 12. He will have tracking device on him so that his team is aware of his position at all times. 13. Reza is doing this dangerous journey to raise money for children in need and to give inspire     those that have lost hope for a better future. Also to raise awareness for his Non-Profit Organization called Plant Unity. Plant Unity is a charity devoted to kids that are in need of basic living necessities. For example, clothes, medical and financial help and also to teach them healthy living skills. Plant Unity slogan is 'Children are like roots of a tree – I like to nourish the roots and help them grow.'

"Hunt supporters are threatening to withdraw backing from the Conservatives at the next election unless ministers act to ease the hunting ban. As more than 250,000 people across the country gather for the traditional Boxing Day meets, supporters are said to be ‘exasperated’ by the Tories’ failure to see through a pledge to hold a Commons vote on scrapping the ban. Many of those taking part in events on the biggest day of the hunting calendar are likely to be children – some as young as five – reflecting the growth of a new generation of supporters spurred on by the ban. Lily-Anna Outram, seven, on horse Macaroni and her brother William Outram, 11, on horse Alfie pictured prior to the Barlow Hunt in Derbyshire (left) and Keira Parsons, aged one, at one of her first hunts (right) The Countryside Alliance said hunts . had attracted increasing numbers of children since the sport’s profile . was raised by the 2004 Hunting Act that banned hunting foxes with a pack . of hounds. Membership . of the Warwickshire Hunt has more than doubled since the ban to more . than 1,000 members, with children as young as five attending regular . meets. Sam Butler, the . hunt’s chairman, said: ‘There are more people taking part now than . before the ban. We have seen a marked increase in children coming along . with their parents or minders.’ Most . of the gatherings practise trail-hunting, where huntsmen follow a trail . across the countryside laid with a rag steeped in fox scent. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has dismayed the hunting community . by indicating there is no imminent prospect of the Tories delivering on . their manifesto pledge to hold a vote on repealing the hunting ban. Mr . Paterson has pointed to the fact that many Lib Dems, and some Tories, . do not support repeal, adding: ‘There’s only a point having a vote if . you’re going to win.’ But he is also accused of prevaricating over a . plan to ‘relax’ one element of the ban, which supporters say would help . control fox numbers. 11-year-old Harriet Smith out hunting in the Norfolk countryside . Mr . Paterson has now been warned that he needs to make it clear by the end . of next month that he will deliver on the issue, or face the potential . desertion of hunt supporters at the election. Tory . MP Simon Hart, a former chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, . acknowledged that the patience of rural supporters was wearing thin. He . said hunting was one of a number of factors fuelling ‘disgruntlement’, . along with issues like planning reforms, wind farms and HS2. He . said: ‘If you are a rural voter and activist who turned out to help in . 2010 with a spring in your step for the new dawn the Conservatives were . promising, do you still feel the same way? No, you don’t, and there is . only so much you can blame the Lib Dems for.’ Mr . Paterson and Mr Cameron have both publicly voiced support for the idea . of a small relaxation in the hunting ban, which would allow farmers to . use a pack of dogs to flush a fox from cover before shooting it. One . senior figure in the hunting community said: ‘Our people have had a . bellyful. We’ve had lots of sympathy and warm words from ministers, but . they haven’t actually lifted a finger to help us. We want this relaxation and it is completely deliverable if they show a bit of leadership.’ Charlotte Outram, 39, and her children Lily, seven, and William, 11, are all involved with the  Barlow Hunt in Derbyshire. Mrs Outram said: ‘They love it – they want to go out as often as they can. It is a family day out.’ Jack Wingfield-Digby, who runs the Hunting Stock Market selling hunting clothes and equipment in Sturminster Newton, Dorset, said: ‘We have been providing more and more for children – from about the age of eight upwards. ‘With our local hunt, the Blackmore and Sparkford Vale, I know there is a tremendous amount of children out, many more then I remember from when I was young.’ Charlotte Cooper, of the Countryside Alliance, said the ban needed to be scrapped because no fewer foxes were being killed now than before it was introduced. She said: ‘They get shot by farmers as they still have to reduce the number of foxes out on the land. We believe hunting is a very humane and natural way to get rid of them.’ While welcoming the surge in support for the sport, she said hunting was different than before the ban. ‘It is now much more predictable – it takes out the element of not knowing what is going to happen,’ she said.","Countryside Alliance said hunts attracted increasing numbers of children .

"All 52 workers were airlifted off the Beatrice oil platform 15 miles off Wick, north east Scotland, after a ship carrying radioactive waste caught fire near it . An oil platform in the North Sea was evacuated after a cargo vessel carrying radioactive waste  began drifting towards it. Crew on the ship, the MV Parida, shut down its engines after a fire started in one of its funnels as they tried to carry out repairs. The ship, which was on its way from Scotland to Belgium, started to drift towards the Beatrice oil platform 15 miles south east of Wick on the north east coast of Scotland. All 52 people on the oil platform, which can be seen from the shore, were airlifted off it and the rig was shut down as a precaution, Shetland Coastguard said. The oil workers were lifted off by rescue helicopter 137 from RAF Lossiemouth and coastguard helicopter 102 from Sumburgh. Meanwhile all 15 crew members on the Danish-owned Parida remained on board, and the ship's cargo was said to have been unaffected by the fire. The Parida was transporting Belgian cement waste back to Belgium after collecting it from Dounreay nuclear plant in Caithness where it had been reprocessed. Shetland Coastguard was called at around 8pm last night and arranged for its emergency towing vessel to attend the scene from Orkney, but the Parida's operators arranged for the ship to be towed by a commercial vessel to Cromarty Firth, where it dropped anchor. The ship is now expected to undergo repairs before continuing its journey back to Antwerp. A spokesman for Ithaca Energy, which owns the platform, said they hoped to return staff to the platform today. 'Because the ship was drifting overnight towards our platform we did what is standard procedure and shut the platform down and evacuated all personnel to shore, and that worked very safely and efficiently,' he said. 'We are going to focus on getting our people back out to the platform today and do what we need to start production again.' Scotland's Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead said ministers had been informed about the movements of the ship, which is listed on shipping websites as sailing under a Danish flag. Lang Banks, director of WWF Scotland said: 'This incident highlights the problems of dealing with the hazardous and expensive radioactive mess that the nuclear industry always leaves in its wake. 'Given all the severe weather warnings, questions need to be asked as to why a vessel carrying radioactive material was at sea at all.'

"Ministers will not try to water down the hunting ban before the election, David Cameron said yesterday. The Prime Minister said opposition from the Liberal Democrats meant a compromise plan to make it easier for hill farmers to control foxes had been dropped. Mr Cameron said the decision was a matter of ‘regret’, and Downing Street insisted it remained committed to giving MPs a free vote on repealing the hunt ban ‘when time allows’. Ministers have ruled out plans to water down the ban on fox hunting before the next election . But Tory MPs warned the decision would dismay many traditional supporters in the countryside, and could even cost the party seats at the next election. Pro-hunting umbrella group Vote OK flooded Tory marginals with up to 15,000 volunteers at the last election in the hope of securing a majority in favour of repealing Labour’s ban. Many also campaigned at the 2005 election and at subsequent by-elections. Tory MP Simon Hart said there was now little prospect of the party attracting similar grassroots support at next year’s General Election. Mr Hart, a former chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, said: ‘We need these people. You can have the slickest leaflets in the world but you still need people to go out and deliver them on a wet Wednesday night, and that is something all the parties are struggling with. ‘David Cameron is aware of that, and people recognise he is sympathetic, but the facts of coalition mean he does not have much room for manoeuvre. ‘It will unquestionably have an effect next year in some marginal seats. Those people in rural seats who lose by less than 2,000 votes will be left wondering what might have been if we had been able to do more on hunting.’ But one senior figure in the hunting community said supporters felt betrayed by the lack of Government action on hunting. ‘Our people have had a bellyful,’ he said. ‘We’ve had lots of sympathy and warm words from ministers, but they haven’t actually lifted a finger to help us.’ David Cameron has been pressured into ruling out changes by the Lib Dems, but pro-hunting MP Simon Hart fears the lack of action on the issue could cost the Conservatives at the next election . Ministers had been considering a call by Welsh hill farmers to relax the hunting ban to help them control foxes. The change would have allowed farmers to use a pack of dogs to flush a fox from cover before shooting it. A recent study found that the current limit of using two dogs is ineffective and means foxes are chased for longer. But the move would require a vote in parliament and the support of both governing parties. Critics of the plan said it amounted to a lifting of the hunting ban by the back door. Mr Cameron yesterday told MPs the proposal ‘has been received and is being considered but I regret to say I don’t think there’ll be Government agreement to go forward’. The Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is expected to launch a consultation on the proposals in the coming months, but there is now no prospect of the change being brought in before the election. Hunt opponents welcomed Mr Cameron’s climbdown. Joe Duckworth, chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: ‘I am delighted that we have flushed out this back door attack on the Hunting Act. 'What they planned would have driven a coach and horses through the Act. I am delighted we have thwarted this plot from a tiny but powerful hunting lobby.’","Cameron rules out changes to ban after opposition from Lib Dems .

"The hunt for the killer of a 65-year-old British man shot dead in his Brittany home has taken a bizarre twist - as it emerged that the victim had assumed the identity of a dead  rock star. The man was known in the small coastal village of Plounevez-Lochrist as Glenn Miller - the retired bassist for cult Canadian band Chilliwack. But the real Miller died in Toronto three years ago, gendarmes discovered after contacting Canadian police. Scroll down for video . The real Glenn Miller (left) was a bassist for Canadian band Chilliwack, who were most popular in the 1970s . Miller was a member Chilliwack - who were most popular during the 1970s - for almost 30 years, before leaving in 1988 to start a career in drug rehabilitation. He died in March 2011 after suffering from muscular dystrophy, and the murdered Brit who assumed the same name arrived in Plounevez-Lochrist, near the Channel port of Roscoff, at around the same time, residents say. He adopted the look of a seventies rocker; he had a shaven head and wore a large leather beret, eccentric clothes, John Lennon glasses, Mexican boots and a belt with a massive shiny buckle. Locals would ask him to play guitar, but he would always refuse, saying he suffered from severe arthritis in his fingers. He was found lying in a pool of blood on Sunday morning. He had been killed instantly by a bullet which passed through his neck, leaving a gaping wound. Forensic gendarmes were baffled to find no trace whatsoever of the bullet or signs of a projectile having struck furniture or the walls of the dining room of the house, where the victim lived alone close to an idyllic tourist beach. The British man had been living in a farmhouse in Brittany for nearly four years before he was murdered . The false Glenn Miller lived in Plounevez-Lochrist, near the Channel port of Roscoff, where he was popular . He used to tell people in the local bar that he was Miller, and would describe to them a lifestyle in Toronto that matched that of the rocker. His lifestyle in Brittany was certainly not in keeping with that of a wealthy retired rock guitarist living in the sun, however. He appeared to lead a modest life, walking everywhere and occasionally working as a day labourer in fields collecting onions and cabbages. He was even  forced to beg for money at Roscoff port, locals said. 'He was quiet and a pleasant man and well liked. He didn't drink heavily and would often just order a coffee and sit at an outside table and smoke a cigarette,' said a café owner. A bartender added that it was believed he had inherited his farmhouse from his uncle: 'His sister who was from England introduced him to us four years ago and said he was her brother. 'We got to know him well. He was from England had played in a band as a guitarist in Canada. 'He had lived here in his house for four years. He inherited the house from his uncle when he died. Glenn's mother was a local French woman from the village and his father was English. 'Latterly he had had a problem with his hand due probably to arthritis. He said he couldn't play guitar any more because he couldn't move his fingers much. He didn't drink a lot and he didn't seem to have a girlfriend. He lived alone in the house.' A spokesman for the Foreign Office said yesterday that they knew the true identity of the man, though could not confirm it yet. Forensic officers have returned to the murder house  and resumed searching for clues in the dining room where the victim died and other areas of the large house, which was described as being 'extremely untidy'. Investigators have also studied bloody footprints left on the floor of the dining room which are believed to be those of the killer. The man named initially as Glenn Miller by French Police was wearing slippers at the time of his death  at 11pm last Saturday. The neighbour who discovered the body on Sunday morning did not leave any traces on the floor of the room as the victim's blood had already dried. Members of his family from southern England were said to have arrived in France yesterday.","British man had told villagers he was Canadian former Chilliwack bassist .

Pregnant ladies, babies: how can they stay here?rotest. They not happy. They say it's not fair. They don't want to go to Cambodia.' There is a strong history of unrest at Nauru. In July 2013 a riot occurred there which eventually costed $60 million in damages. Four people were hospitalised.

Protestors at the refugee camp have received 'a savage response' from police and detention security, says Ian Rintoul,a  spokesperson for the Refugee Action Coalition .

A spokesperson for the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection told Daily Mail 'The government can confirm that a 15 year old girl was transferred to Australia from Nauru on 26 September for medical treatment. 'A family member has accompanied her to Australia. 'The girl is currently in Australia receiving medical treatment. 'It is long standing government practice not to confirm or comment on reports of individual acts of self-harm.' 'The Minister has been advised that the department is aware that some transferees are engaging in peaceful protest activity in Nauru, and is working with its service providers to ensure the continued safety and good order of the facility.' Morrison's agreement has been widely criticised, largely due to Cambodia being a poverty-stricken nation. The plan has been condemned by Cambodia's opposition group, who said the Australian money from the deal would be corruptly spent by Cambodia's ruling party. Human rights and aid groups in Cambodia have called the deal disgraceful, since the country has a terrible record for protecting refugees. There have also been significant protests outside the Australian embassy in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Hundreds gathered there to demand Australia renounces the agreement.

"Everton duo Kevin Mirallas and James McCarthy could both return to action for the Toffees’ Boxing Day clash with Stoke at Goodison Park. Belgium winger Mirallas picked up an ankle injury after a poor challenge from QPR’s Jordon Mutch last week, causing him to miss Saturday’s 3-0 defeat at Southampton. McCarthy, who has struggled with injuries this term, has been out since suffering a hamstring problem against Wolfsburg in late November. Everton duo Kevin Mirallas and James McCarthy could feature against Stoke after recovering from injury . Everton boss Roberto Martinez will be delighted with news of Mirallas and McCarthy's return from injury . But manager Roberto Martinez has confirmed that both players have a chance of featuring in Friday’s game against the Potters. Speaking in his pre-match press conference, Martinez said: ‘Kevin Mirallas has got a great chance to be involved over the next two games.

"Alan Pardew will make a new goalscorer his No.1 priority in January as he bids to resurrect Newcastle’s season. The Magpies have lost three matches on the spin, including the League Cup quarter-final at Spurs and Sunday’s Tyne-Wear derby. They have scored just once in that period – Ayoze Perez’s consolation in the 4-1 defeat at Arsenal – and while the young Spaniard has been a positive for Pardew, he remains concerned about the condition of seven-goal top scorer Papiss Cisse. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew remains concerned about the condition of top scorer Papiss Cisse . And that will see Pardew ask owner Mike Ashley to open his cheque book when the transfer window reopens in the New Year. ‘I think we are still a striker light,’ he said. ‘Even when Siem de Jong returns, I think we’ll need another one. ‘Papiss - even taking away the flu - he is still not right. He’s not 100 per cent and you could see that in the way he plays. That’s something we need to look at. We need another striker if we can get one.’ Pardew will make a new goalscorer his No 1 priority in January as he bids to resurrect Newcastle’s season . Danny Ings is United’s top target but Burnley are determined to keep their star striker until the end of the season, even though his contract expires in the summer. For now, 21-year-old Perez will continue to lead the line. The £1.5million former Tenerife forward has scored four from eight starts, and Pardew has been pleasantly surprised by his impact. ‘If you said at start of the year he would be in this position I would have said that was unlikely,’ said Pardew, who will start with Perez at Manchester United on Boxing Day. ‘His physical improvement has been immense. He was already technically accomplished, which was obvious when he arrived. His physical attributes and mentality in games have improved massively. ‘He enjoys playing against top opposition as much as lesser opposition and that bodes well. We have been absolutely reliant on him in a lot of ways. ‘I said at the start of the year we were a striker light and we really needed someone to come through and help us out - and he’s done that.’ Danny Ings is Newcastle's top target but Burnley are determined to keep him until the end of the season . Ayoze Perez, who has scored four goals from eight stars, will continue to lead the line for the Magpies . Pardew, though, is not concerned by Perez’s slight frame. ‘I don’t want him to be a big brute of a player,’ he said. ‘He’s never going to be that, but there is a strength in holding players off the ball and it’s something Remy Cabella needs to gain. ‘When he first arrived he looked too light in training and was knocked off the ball far too easily. He didn’t hold his own in tight areas, but now he does in training and in matches. ‘He’s not going to grow much bigger and I don’t want him to. That wiry strength is a big part of his game. ‘He did a couple of tricks on Sunday that I don’t think anybody else on the pitch could have produced. His feet are so fast. He’s been a real asset. ‘He’s not a natural goalscorer, more a natural forward. He can do the other side of the game, a bit like Wayne Rooney. He can mix it in the midfield and score goals.’","Newcastle manager Alan Pardew want to sign a new striker in January .

"A Palestinian man rammed a minivan into a crowded train platform in east Jerusalem on Wednesday and then attacked people with an iron bar after leaving the vehicle, killing one person and injuring 13 in what authorities called a terror attack before he was shot dead by police. The militant Hamas group took responsibility for the attack, the second such assault in east Jerusalem in the past two weeks. Neighboring Jordan called back the kingdom's ambassador to Israel for consultations in a gesture of protest over the violence in east Jerusalem. The attack deepened already heightened tensions between Arabs and Jews in the city. Earlier Wednesday, Israeli police had dispersed dozens of masked Palestinians who threw rocks and firecrackers near a contested holy site in Jerusalem's Old City. Scroll down for video . Attack: A man drove into commuters on a crowded train platform in east Jerusalem today, before being shot by police. Tensions are high between Arabs and Jews in the city, with clashes almost daily . Police said the motorist slammed his car - a white minivan - into the train platform in east Jerusalem first, backed out and proceeded to drive away, hitting several cars along the way . Israeli policemen patrol the the scene where a Palestinian man, Ibrahim al-Akri, was shot by Israeli police officers after he drove into a crowd of people . Police said the motorist slammed his car - a white minivan - into the train platform in east Jerusalem first, backed out and proceeded to drive away, hitting several cars along the way. He then got out of the car and attacked a group of civilians and police officers on the side of the road with a metal bar before he was shot and killed. Security camera footage appeared to show him darting about a crowded intersection before he was shot. Israeli police said 'one person was killed and about a dozen people were injured in the terror attack.' Police identified the attacker as Ibrahim al-Akri, a 38 year old Palestinian, and said he had recently been released from prison after serving time for security offenses. Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, said al-Akri was a member of the group and that his brother was in exile in Turkey after being released in a 2011 prisoner swap. Hamas' West Bank commander, Saleh Arouri, is based in Turkey. Israeli rescue workers and paramedics carry an injured man to an ambulance after the attack . Locals gather at the scene of a suspected terrorist attack as the area is cordoned off for investigations . It said in a statement that al-Akri, 'whose blood watered the land of the occupied holy city of Jerusalem, preferred but to retaliate for the blood of his people and the sacredness of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and Jerusalem.' Hamas official Fawzi Barhoum praised the 'glorious operation' and called for more such attacks. Israel and Hamas are bitter enemies, and fought a bruising 50-day war over the summer. Israel had no immediate response to the Hamas claim. Israel's Minister of Public Security Yitzhak Ahronovich said civilians and police officers were among the victims. He praised the police officer who killed al-Akri, saying that ""a terrorist who attacks civilians deserves to be killed."" Clashes broke out at Shuafat refugee camp after a Palestinian resident of the camp was named as the driver of the van that rammed into a crowd at a rail stop . Clashes started at the refugee camp following the attack in which one person was killed and at least 13 people were wounded after a driver crashed into pedestrians during a suspected terror attack near East Jerusalem . Hamas official Fawzi Barhoum praised the 'glorious operation' and called for more such attacks, as youngsters clashed with police during riots . The attack was almost identical to one two weeks ago, also committed by a Palestinian from east Jerusalem who rammed his car into a crowded train station, killing a 3-month-old Israeli-American girl and a woman from Ecuador - not far from the scene of Wednesday's attack. East Jerusalem has experienced unrest since the summer, with Palestinian youths throwing stones and firebombs at motorists and clashing frequently with Israeli police. Israel captured east Jerusalem - with its sites sacred to Jews, Muslims and Christians - from Jordan in the 1967 war. Palestinians demand the territory for their future capital. The fate of the area is an emotional issue for Jews and Muslims and its future lies at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. East Jerusalem has experienced unrest since the summer, with Palestinian youths throwing stones and firebombs at motorists and clashing frequently with Israeli police, as was seen today . The attack has deepened already heightened tensions  in the city. Earlier , Israeli police had dispersed dozens of masked Palestinians who threw rocks and firecrackers near a contested holy site in Jerusalem's Old City . The car attack came shortly after clashes in the Old City, where Palestinians threw rocks and firecrackers at police to protest a planned visit to a key holy site by Israeli supporters of a rabbi who was shot by a Palestinian gunman last week . The streets were filled masked youths who began clashes following the crash earlier today . Much of the recent unrest has focused around a sacred compound revered by both Jews and Muslims. It's the holiest site for Jews, who call it the Temple Mount because of the revered Jewish Temples that stood there in biblical times. Muslims refer to it as the Noble Sanctuary, and it is their third holiest site, after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. Wednesday's car attack came shortly after clashes in the Old City, where Palestinians threw rocks and firecrackers at police to protest a planned visit to a key holy site by Israeli supporters of a rabbi who was shot by a Palestinian gunman last week. The Israelis had planned on commemorating a week since the attack on American-Israeli activist Yehuda Glick, who has campaigned for more Jewish access to the location, which is revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. Palestinians view such visits as a provocation and often respond violently. Glick remains in serious condition. Furore: Israeli security forces clash with Palestinian youths in the mostly Arab east Jerusalem neighbourhood of Abu Tor last week . An Israeli policeman pushes back right-wing Israeli settlers who were trying to jump a barrier to cross into the al-Aqsa mosque compound, Islam's third holiest site, but also the most sacred spot for Jews who refer to it as the Temple Mount because it once housed two Jewish temples, in the old city of Jerusalem . Several police officers were hurt in Wednesday's clashes, said police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld, adding that the police used stun grenades to disperse the Palestinians. Quiet was soon restored, he said. Muslim worshippers view Jewish prayer at the site as a provocation, and Israeli authorities place tough restrictions on it. Everyone visiting the area from the Israeli side has to be screened by police. In the Jordanian capital of Amman, the government instructed the foreign ministry to call in the kingdom's ambassador to Israel for consultation in a gesture meant to protest the violence in east Jerusalem. Under a longstanding arrangement with Israel, Jordan retains custodial rights over Muslim holy sites in the Old City.","The Palestinian man ploughed into commuters onto a crowded platform .

"Hull have completed the signing of Michael Dawson from Tottenham for £6million.

VIDEO Scroll down for 'Bruce gushes over Dawson as defender partakes in first session' Done deal: Dawson becomes Hull City's sixth summer signing as Steve Bruce tries to deepen his squad . Moving on: Dawson has been at Tottenham for nine years since joining from Nottingham Forest . 'Michael Dawson has completed a move from Tottenham Hotspur, the club are delighted to announce,' read a statement on City's official website. Dawson, the Tottenham captain last season, played over 300 times for the North London club after joining from Nottingham Forest in 2005. 'The season Hull had last year was incredible,' he told Hull's official Youtube channel. 'To get to the final of the FA Cup, secure the Premier League position and now we've got to look to build on that and that's what we're going to do. 'The chance to be in the group stage of the Europa League with a game on Thursday, all we can do is build on it and look forward to the season ahead. 'You need the squad and the manager is getting the squad together to compete in both or all competitions. The players and the quality we've got in this dressing room, I'm sure we can manage that.' Dawson's older brother Andy spent 10 years with the Tigers as they rose through the divisions and the younger Dawson admits he feels like he knows the club already. 'I know the club well with my family history, with Andy being here,' he said. 'I'm just excited to get started. 'The attraction is the whole football club, the manager the squad of players. 'I know the fans gave me plenty of stick last year when I was playing for Tottenham. Hopefully I'll get a nicer reception now but it was all good fun. 'I'm just ready and raring to go.' Hull manager Steve Bruce has already bolstered his squad with the signings of two forwards and two defenders this summer. Robert Snodgras and Tom Ince have been brought in to provide attacking impetus, although the former has already sustained a long-term injury, while Harry Maguire and Andrew Robertson will provide defensive cover. Hull have also made Jake Livermore's loan deal from last year into a permanent signing. The Tigers face KSC Lokeren at home on Thursday night needing to overturn a one-goal deficit to reach the Europa League group stage.

The 8ft high bronze sculpture, created by Denise Dutton, was unveiled by Sophie, Countess of Wessex, at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.

Muse: Izzy Wright, 21, the granddaughter of Land Girl Mary Wright, posed for the sculpture . James Shallcross, assistant curator at the National Memorial Arboretum, said it was important to recognise the role Land Girls played during and after the two wars. He said: 'The Women's Land Army was a major part of the effort to help the country in a time of conflict. 'Without their help the nation would probably have starved and may well have not won the Second World War.'

Mary, 84, who joined the WLA when she was 17, said: 'It was very physically demanding, but you were doing something for the country. 'They needed women on the farms because there weren't enough labourers to do the work.' Staffordshire Women's Food and Farming Union (SWFU) took three years to raise £85,000 for the memorial. Land Girls worked on farms to feed the nation when men went to war. The official minimum age was 17, but some lied and became Land Girls at 16 or even younger. Many had been barmaids, waitresses, maids, hairdressers or mill workers, and some enrolled straight from school. With their uniform of green ties and jumpers and brown felt slouch hats, they toiled from dawn to dusk each day. They planted and harvested crops, tended animals and poultry, and delivered milk - all for £1.40 a week, with 70p deducted for board and lodging. Often referred to as the 'Forgotten Army ', 20,000 surviving Land Girls were finally honoured in 2007 when the Government announced their efforts would be recognised with a commemorative badge.","The 8ft high bronze sculpture was unveiled by Sophie, Countess of Wessex .

"Two of the biggest clubs in the Aviva Premiership on Saturday night distanced themselves from Saracens’ call to scrap the salary cap and admitted they could not afford it.

That’s a good model to be part of. You’d like it to be loosened a bit for Europe but if you have a couple of sides that can spend £15m it makes the league uneven. ‘We can only afford to spend what we’ve got. We’re not in debt and that’s how we want to stay.’ Northampton boss Jim Mallinder said: ‘We couldn’t go up to £10-15m. I’ve no interest in scrapping it.

"There will be a party atmosphere at the Ricoh Arena today but Wasps are already in danger of becoming the noisy neighbours as they begin a new life in Coventry. Local rivals including Northampton and Worcester will not be welcoming the ex-London club with open arms, with new claims of franchising, under-priced tickets and council secrecy threatening to puncture the euphoria of the occasion. In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Northampton chief executive officer Allan Robson accused Wasps, who announced their move from Adams Park in October, of showing a complete disregard for local clubs and a failure to consult relevant stakeholders.

Other tenants: Wycombe Wanderers . RICOH ARENA . Capacity: 32,609 . Opened: 2005 . Other tenants: Coventry City . ‘We don’t welcome them,’ said Robson. ‘For the likes of Northampton Saints and Leicester Tigers, this has been our heartland and we really don’t feel threatened. But clubs like Worcester have had to work very hard to expand their territory for commercial benefits and could feel this very badly. ‘If I were Coventry (RFC), then I would be pretty miffed. I somehow don’t think this has been done in collusion in Coventry. There are other local clubs like Moseley, Solihull and Birmingham — I don’t think it’s a very nice thing to have done on Wasps’ part. ‘We knew nothing of it until the whole situation was public. As a partner in a very tight group of rugby clubs, I don’t think it was handled particularly well. It smacks of franchises and that’s not where rugby is currently.’ Shortly after the initial announcement, Worcester voiced concerns about the damaging impact the move could have on their £1.5million academy investment in the region and in 2016 there will be a potential opportunity for Wasps to move their talent catchment area to the Midlands. Wasps winger Varndell stretches his legs during his team's open training session at the Coventry stadium . Nick Eastwood, the Wasps CEO, said: ‘It’s up to the RFU how they draw the boundaries. There are a lot of anomalies all over the country —some clubs have huge areas and some are very small. We will not do anything whatsoever to put ourselves in breach of that law and we’ll comply with that. The RFU will do what they think is best for English rugby.’ For now, Wasps will continue to train in West London and travel to Coventry on match days. They expect an attendance of more than 27,000 for this afternoon’s match against London Irish. The same fixture attracted just 7,025 at Adams Park last season. ‘There has been a lot of fuss about their 27,000 crowd, but that’s not a sale of 27,000,’ said Robson. ‘They have given most of them away for free or at heavily discounted rates. The key in terms of their impact in that conurbation will be a season down the line, we’ll see what their average gates are then. ‘I feel sorry the Wasps supporters who have been following their club for a number of years, because the club have just turned their back on them.’ England lock Joe Launchbury (left) is one of the star attractions in the current Wasps line-up . Wasps insist they have given away only 3,000 tickets to local schoolchildren, with the lowest-priced ticket costing £15. With almost 24,000 tickets sold in advance, the club expect ticket revenue of more than £500,000 for Sunday’s match. In the longer term, the club hopes to improve on their average attendance of little more than 6,000. With a casino, hotel and restaurants already in place at the Ricoh, they are optimistic they can almost triple their annual turnover to more than £20m. ‘As long as we improve on our average attendance at Adams Park then we’re ahead,’ said Eastwood. ‘Because of the confidential nature of the agreement we were unable to say anything to fans in the lead-up to the sale. The first 48 hours after the announcement was tough but since we’ve had the opportunity to explain the decision I think most fans understand the reasoning. ‘It’s sad if we lose any fans because they’ve stuck through us through thick and thin. But to their credit I think they understand that if it’s the difference between not having a club or having a club in a different place they’d take the latter. Local school children embrace their new club at the Ricoh Arena during a Wasps training session . ‘It was a case of move or die. It may not have happened next week, or next month but at some point in the not-too-distant future we would have faced insurmountable debts. ‘No one’s going to say “we’d rather you went out of business”.’ The Aviva Premiership outfit are hoping to develop a new fanbase in the area, but that could have a damaging impact on National One side Coventry RFC. Their director of rugby, Phil Maynard, hopes to build a working relationship with Wasps but remains disappointed with the local council for their lack of communication over the relocation. ‘We had one meeting with them in October,’ Maynard said. ‘We didn’t really have much of a say — we were told they were probably going to relocate. If we’ve got a beef, it’s with Coventry City Council. Our beef isn’t with Wasps and it never has been. The issue we had is that the council kept us completely in the dark about it. If this is going to work, it’s important that we form a productive partnership.’","Wasps have moved to the Ricoh Arena from Adams Park .

"Rafael Nadal is optimistic about his chances of being ready for next month's Australian Open after returning to training this week following surgery. The 28-year-old Spaniard admits, however, that he will start the 2015 season 'from almost zero', while he expects his main rivals Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer to continue their recent fine form. Nadal missed the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London last month to undergo surgery to remove his appendix. Rafael Nadal is optimistic about his chances of being ready for next month's Australian Open . Nadal smiles during a ceremony in which he was labelled the 'favourite son of Mallorca' o Monday . The 14-time Grand Slam champion, who has also battled knee, wrist and back problems, is now on the comeback trail though and, after returning to training on Monday, is already casting his eye towards a return to competitive action. Nadal is looking at the events in Abu Dhabi and Doha at the start of 2015 as a chance to step up his recovery ahead of the Australian Open, which begins on January 19. The former world number one said on his official Facebook page: 'Very happy to be training again and excited to prepare the next season.' He added in an interview with Spanish newspaper AS: 'It's always a bit tough starting off after a few difficult months, without any continuity, and after the last month and half without being able to play any sport and the appendicitis. 'What I have to do this month is to get myself fit physically, progress my tennis as much as possible and lay the foundations to start well in Abu Dhabi and in Doha. '(Then) Take advantage of those tournaments to recover the competitiveness that I've not had for months due to the injuries.' Nadal's only Australian Open triumph so far came back in 2009, but he was runner-up to Djokovic in 2012 and reached the final again earlier this year only to lose to Stan Wawrinka. The Spaniard has been out a month but positively returned to training on Monday . When asked about the possibility of him being fully fit for Melbourne Park in six weeks' time, Nadal said: 'If you train well and you feel right physically, the process is much quicker. 'In a few days you pick up the speed of the ball again, the movement in the legs and, if I do good work at home and I play well at the start of the year, that could be enough to arrive in Australia well prepared.' Nadal refused to look too far ahead, though, and admitted he does not know if he will be able to continue his record run that has seen him win at least one grand slam title every year for the last decade. He said 'Nobody has managed to go 10 successive years winning a grand slam, it's a lot. I don't know if I will be able to...but neither am I thinking about it. 'What I must do is play well, prepare, and when the moment comes, give myself opportunities. If one of those is in the final rounds, anything could happen.' Nadal is currently third in the world rankings behind Djokovic and a rejuvenated Federer, but he knows he is having to play catch-up to his two big rivals. Asked if next year will again be dominated by himself, the Serbian and the Swiss, Nadal: 'You never know what can happen. This isn't forever. 'I think Federer has finished the year very well, the same as Djokovic. They are going start again strongly and I from almost zero, with more problems. 'I have to recover what I've lost during the last six months. It's a nice challenge to overcome and I'm motivated.'","Rafa Nadal could be in line to play in the first Grand Slam of 2015 .

"George Boyd is not expecting Brendan Rodgers to follow suit any time soon but admits that he quit as Liverpool boss on the Football Manager video game after seeing his team slump to fifth place. In reality, Rodgers’s side are languishing in 10th position off the back of last season’s narrow title miss and play Burnley at Turf Moor on Boxing Day with the Northern Irishman’s future at Anfield still in question. However, Boyd is convinced Rodgers will eventually get it right despite Liverpool’s current malaise. George Boyd admits he quit as Liverpool boss on Championship Manager . Boyd has backed Brendan Rodgers to turn things around after a poor start to the season at Anfield . ‘There are about 15 of the boys who play (the video game),’ said the Burnley midfielder. ‘A few of us chose Liverpool to see who could do the best with them. I’m struggling. I think I’m fifth now. I got bored so I’ve started a new game and gone down to Stevenage. ‘I’m not saying I’m better than him though! He’s a top manager. He proved that last year with how close Liverpool were. ‘They spent a lot of money in the summer and it will take time, but you see what a top quality coach he is. Boyd and Burnley have enjoyed an upturn in fortunes over the past month . ‘They’ve just been on a bit of a blip but the class is always there and it will come through in the end. I won’t be knocking on his door any time soon.’ Boyd played in Hull’s shock 3-1 win over Liverpool last December and has bought into Burnley’s work ethic since arriving in a £3million move in the summer. Last month it was revealed that he ran further than any other Premier League player in a single game this season, covering more than eight miles in Burnley’s win at Stoke. ‘It’s something I’ve prided myself on throughout my career but I think it’s more evident in this team because everyone works so hard,’ said Boyd. Boyd has been going the extra mile - literally - to help Burnley's survival scrap . ‘If you’ve been down in the lower leagues you don’t want to go back there so you work even harder to stay at this level. Everyone in the squad is enjoying it and doesn’t want it to stop. ‘Our game is about pressing and getting in people’s faces. We’ll try to disrupt Liverpool and play our own game. ‘They have spent so much money and we need to close the gap. If work-rate is the way to do that then so be it. We haven’t got £30m to go and buy strikers so we work hard to make it an even playing field.’","Burnley midfielder took charge of Liverpool while playing video game .

"Mark Hughes bemoaned Chelsea's superior quality after a goal either side of half-time meant Stoke couldn't replicate their recent home heroics. The Potters went down against the league leaders after John Terry and Cesc Fabregas kept Jose Mourinho's side marching on at the Premier League's summit.

"Mauricio Pochettino wants Ryan Mason to trust his body-strength after escaping what initially appeared to be a serious ankle injury. Mason had to be helped from the pitch during the first half of Tottenham's win against Burnley on Saturday, fearing a major set-back just as his career was taking off. But Pochettino has confirmed there is no major damage to the ligaments and hopes to have the 23-year-old midfielder back in his team before the festive fixtures are over. Ryan Mason was taken off against Burnley on Saturday after injuring his ankle . Mason has started the last 12 Premier League games for Tottenham but is a doubt for Boxing Day . 'He's stronger than he believes,' said the Spurs boss. 'He twisted his ankle and suffered a lot of pain but luckily no damage. 'We show him that he has improved his physical condition from the beginning of the season. 'But we need to be careful because it is his first season in the Premier League.'

"Gus Poyet believes his players are now convinced by his methods after their Tyne-Wear derby victory. The Uruguayan had spoken just a week earlier about being ‘bored’ and ‘frustrated’ with his team after a run of five draws in six matches. But Poyet feels the players have bought into his vision and says the 1-0 win at St James’ Park can prove a turning point in his tenure. Adam Johnson fires Sunderland into a 1-0 lead to earn all three points for Gus Poyet's side against Newcastle . Johnson (11) watches on as his powerful striker flies past the dive of Newcastle goalkeeper Jak Alnwick . ‘The players are convinced now,’ he said. ‘I know we had that bad day at Southampton (8-0 defeat) and that will be there all of my life. ‘But the players are confident that what we’re doing is working. We just needed a win. ‘This now is confirmation of what we do. I’m still thinking we need to improve because I don’t want any more draws. I want to win football games.’ Sunday’s victory – achieved thanks to Adam Johnson’s last-minute strike – was just their third maximum return of the season, while they have drawn 10 times. And Poyet added: ‘You need to start somewhere. First, I want my team to be solid. We conceded like 2,000 goals last season in the first part of the season. Sunderland boss Gus Poyet said the players are now convinced by his methods after another Tyne-Wear win . The Black Cats winger wheels away in celebration of his 90th minute winner at St James Park . ‘I want us first to be difficult to beat, then you start playing and taking chances. ‘But how long does that take? I still want to see more, I don’t change because of this one game. I’m ambitious – that’s the mentality I want. ‘The next game is the most important. Last year when we won the derby we didn’t think the next game was important and we went two months without winning a game. ‘I’m going to fight until the players have that mentality, that only the next game matters. ‘That’s what I want to see now. I don’t expect them to play like Bayern Munich – it’s about being the same team but with the confidence to produce those special moments.’ Sunderland manager Poyet reacts furiously to the first half foul from Magpies defender Coloccini . Johnson’s special moment in stoppage-time was his third goal on Tyneside in as many seasons. The former England winger has been below his best so far in this campaign, but Poyet hopes that derby glory can prove a catalyst for an upturn in his form. ‘We need moments to make the team believe in what we’re doing is working. Johnno showed that,' he said. ‘Last year he was brilliant in January, maybe that will come a little bit earlier this time. Johnson looks towards the Newcastle fans as he is joined by his Sunderland team-mates in celebration . ‘This season we’ve been asking him to do too many things in defence – he has been too far from the opposition goal. ‘The responsibility is 50-50 – some of it mine because of the way we play, the other half is with the player and when he gets the chance he needs to produce. ‘You don’t score away from home in a derby three years in a row if you’re bad, no, he’s a special player. ‘This will help him a lot. I would say he will be very good over the next few games now.’","Sunderland beat  Newcastle 1-0 in Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby .

"Gus Poyet says that even the richest man in the world could not buy the derby joy he and his Sunderland side experienced on Sunday. The Black Cats claimed a fourth successive victory over arch-rivals Newcastle and their third on the trot at St James' Park at the weekend to leave Wearside wreathed in smiles and the men who secured it experiencing 'unique' emotions. Poyet revealed even a post-match warm-down and an enforced prolonged stay on Tyneside could not spoil the party. Adam Johnson fires Sunderland into a 1-0 lead to earn all three points for Gus Poyet's side against Newcastle . Johnson (11) watches on as his powerful striker flies past the dive of Newcastle goalkeeper Jak Alnwick . He said: 'I know how much it means. We scored and we went ballistic and it was difficult to control the bench - imagine how much it means for them (the fans), who have been supporting this club all their lives? 'It was special. It's so special that it doesn't matter how long you have to stay at the ground, because we were held for a while. Normally you would have every single player complaining, 'Let's go'. 'Nobody complained, everybody was all right, everything changed. Even if you say to them to go and do a warm-down and they need to go back to the pitch, it was no problem this time. 'It's unique, it's the best part of football. It's not about money. I'm sure that the biggest multi-millionaire in the world would pay whatever money it takes to be part of that moment. The Black Cats winger wheels away in celebration of his 90th minute winner at St James Park . Sunderland boss Gus Poyet said money cannot buy the feeling of winning a Tyne-Wear derby . 'And you know what? He can't because you need to be a football player or be involved in football to be there and feel it. It's not about money, it's about being good enough.' Poyet, who was installed as the club's new head coach in October last year, boasts a 100 per cent record in his three derbies to date having quickly gleaned just how important those games are to two clubs and their respective fans. The win was just Sunderland's third in the Barclays Premier League in 17 attempts this season and while Poyet will now turn his attention to the Boxing Day clash with struggling Hull and the business of putting together back-to-back victories, he knows just what their latest success means to the supporters. He said: 'I'll tell you what, when you come here you know you need to win one or two games, especially these ones, and the times you win them, there is no better. Johnson looks towards the Newcastle fans as he is joined by his Sunderland team-mates in celebration . 'I don't think they care too much about the rest, the fans, they just care about this one, and it's great to be on this side of it. There is no better feeling. 'Now we are already somehow thinking ""can we go one better when we play at the Stadium of Light?"" Every single game now between us and Newcastle is going to be bigger because of that record.' Sunday's victory was all the more impressive as it came after Anthony Reveillere, the club's only fit specialist left back, limped out of the warm-up with a calf injury, although one which has proved to be not as serious as was first feared. Poyet said: 'It's an injury, but it's a muscle tear. We were really worried because of the translation of what he felt, we were thinking it was something really bad. Sunderland manager Poyet reacts furiously to the first half foul from Magpies defender Coloccini . John O'Shea filled in at left back for the Black Cats on Sunday and Poyet praised the experienced defender . 'But in the end, it's just a tear and the normal time would be between three and four weeks. It's not lucky that he's injured, but we feared the worst, so it's not that bad.' Hugely-experienced skipper John O'Shea was asked to step out of central defence to plug the gap, and he performed his role with aplomb to win fresh praise from Poyet. The Uruguayan said: 'Experience, understanding, composure - it's great to have him. That's why he's the skipper. You don't pick them just by luck, you know what you need and it was easy.'","Sunderland beat Newcastle 1-0 at St James' Park on Sunday .

"West Ham striker Andy Carroll says manager Sam Allardyce is a grandmaster ready to tactically outclass Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho on Boxing Day. Allardyce believes January's goalless draw at Stamford Bridge - when Mourinho accused the Hammers of playing 'football from the 19th century' - was the turning point last season.

'He's not the same every week. He wants a win, but you've got to watch the teams, how they're playing, how we're going to break them down and win the game.

"Ian Holloway let rip at referee Stuart Attwell after Millwall slipped to a 1-0 Sky Bet Championship defeat at home to Bolton. Darren Pratley struck the winner in the 68th minute to condemn the Lions to a third straight home loss. But Lions boss Holloway was raging after Attwell turned down what appeared to be a clear penalty for his side - and what should have subsequently been a red card for Bolton goalkeeper Andy Lonergan - after he sent Lee Gregory flying in the area shortly after half-time. Ian Holloway is raging after Millwall's 1-0 defeat to Bolton in their Championship clash . Lions striker Lee Gregory (left) appeared to be brought down by Bolton keeper Andy Lonergan . Striker Gregory was through on goal and had touched the ball past the onrushing Lonergan before the pair collided, but Attwell bafflingly gave nothing. And Den boss Holloway said: 'The biggest contentious issue of the whole game was very upsetting and very annoying. 'If that's not a foul then Gregory should have been booked for diving. It was clear to Bolton's bench, to be fair, they knew it should have been a penalty and down to 10 men, and that would have changed the complexion of the game. 'Do me a favour, book my man for diving or send their keeper off. Don't just play on!' Darren Prately scored the winner for Bolton to condemn Millwall to a third consecutive home defat .

'It could easily have been given,' he said. 'Andy maintained Gregory has gone into him, but the referee had a decision to make and thankfully it went our way. 'I can understand Ian's frustration, we're both in same position. Maybe we've had a stroke of luck. I don't think the ref had a great game for either side.' Millwall had the best two chances of the first half but Gregory and Angel Martinez fired both of them wide. Bolton winger Hall was somehow denied a goal on the hour mark when his shot cannoned off the inside of the post, flew along the line and off Lions goalkeeper David Forde's leg before rolling to safety. But Pratley struck in the 68th minute when he collected Lee Chung-Yong's fine pass, beat Danny Shittu on the edge of the area and arrowed his shot past Forde and into the net. Millwall's Martyn Woolford (left) missed a chance to score a late equaliser . Martyn Woolford could have equalised with five minutes remaining but, to add to Millwall's frustration, Lonergan was out quickly to make a fine save. It was only Bolton's second win on the road this season and lifted them up to 14th. Lennon added: 'That's the best we've played away from home for a while.

"Ian Holloway blasted referee Stuart Attwell for failing to award Millwall a penalty as his side lost at home to Bolton. Darren Pratley scored the only goal of the game as Bolton extended their unbeaten run to seven games. But Holloway was left fuming as Attwell turned down Millwall’s calls for a spot-kick when striker Lee Gregory was brought down by keeper Andy Lonergan when through on goal early in the second half.

Millwall manager Ian Holloway was left fuming after referee Stuart Attwell failed to award his team a penalty . Eidur Gudjohnsen makes his second debut for Bolton Wanderers as he makes his return after 14 years . The former Chelsea striker looked to threaten David Forde's goal but couldn't open his second account . Holloway said: ‘If that is not a foul and a penalty and a red card then I don’t know what is. ‘Book my man for diving or send the keeper off and award a penalty. Make a decision. Don’t just wave play on. The fourth official saw it and how the referee missed it I don't know. ‘But I am also fuming because of our play. The game should have been 0-0, we got a free kick and we didn't take it in the right way and they went and scored at the other end. If we had taken that the right way then the most contentious decision of the game would not have mattered so much.’ Bolton made the better start and almost took the lead in the opening minutes when Tim Ream’s glancing header from a corner forced Millwall keeper David Forde into making a save. Eidur Gudjohnsen - who was making his first start for Bolton after coming out of retirement - showed glimpses of magic with his exquisite first touch and ability to pick out a pass. But was unable to find the killer ball to help the visitors take the lead. Millwall’s first chance of the game came midway through the first half when Magaye Gueye picked out Lee Gregory with a pin-point pass but the striker fired his shot across goal and just beyond the far post. Forde was forced into another save when Lee Chung-Yong played in Darren Pratley - but the midfielder was unable to find a way past the Millwall keeper. And it was Millwall who ended the half on top as Angel fired just wide from a Andy Wilkinson cross. Gudjohnsen's second debut for Bolton finishes after an hour as Neil Lennon replaces him with Liam Trotter . Trotters manager Neil Lennon issues instructions to his players as he watches them draw at The Den . Millwall (4-4-2): Forde 6.5, Wilkinson 6 (Abdou 77), Dunne 6, Shittu 6.5, Malone 6, Gueye 6.5 (Martin 57), Martinez 6, Williams 6, Woolford 6, McDonald 6 (Fuller 55), Gregory 6.5.

Subs not used: Bogdan, Moxey, Spearing, Wheater, Clough. Goals: Pratley 68. Booked: Danns, Mills, Pratley. Att: 8,635 . Ref: Stuart Attwell (Warwickshire) 6 . Millwall were looking for their second win in a row following last week’s victory at Bolton and no one seemed to want it more than stand-in skipper Danny Shittu who ran the length of the pitch only to lose the ball and end up in the book for a foul on Lee - but it was enough to bring the home fans to life. Former Den midfielder Liam Trotter replaced Goodjohnsen on the hour mark and was greeted to a chorus of boos. But he nearly had the last laugh as his first shot from distance forced Forde into making a save . The best chance of the game fell to Rob Hall whose shot hit the inside of the post before hitting Forde and somehow not crossing the line. But the visitors did take the lead minutes later when Darren Pratley was played through and fired his shot in off the underside off the crossbar to give Bolton a lead they just about deserved. And in the dying minutes they needed Lonergan to make sure of the win as he denied Martyn Woolford when the Millwall man was through on goal. Bolton boss Neil Lennon said: ‘That’s the best we have played away from home for a while and we were worthy of the win. ‘The penalty could easily have been given. Andy maintains that Gregory ran into him and thankfully the decision went our way. ‘We felt we could have had one in the first half after a barge on Rob Hall. ‘But of course I feel sympathy when a decision goes against you. We have had them in the past when they don’t go your way so I can understand Ian’s frustration. ‘I didn't think the referee had the best of games for either side, but I’m grateful the decision went our way.’ The win lifts the Trotters up to 14th in the Championship and Lennon can reflect on a good start to his Bolton tenure having taken over with the side languishing in the bottom three when he took charge in September.","Darren Pratley scored the only goal of the game for Bolton at The Den .

"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has ordered Andy Carroll not to rest on his laurels after scoring twice against Swansea City and  told the striker: 'You're not there yet, son!'

'He must not get complacent and I would say: ""You're not there yet son, make sure you continue to improve and the only way you'll do that is continue to work hard after the deserved rest all the lads will have after three tough games in a short period of time"". 'After that, though, it will be back to hard graft on the training ground, in the gym and keeping himself as fit as possible.' Alex Song is another producing plenty for West Ham, having settled quickly since joining on a season-long loan from Barcelona.

'It helped make us better in possession of the ball and made us much more creative. Alex and Stewart Downing were terrific in the diamond shape. 'In final-third areas we score so many goals because of the quality of our delivery from Stewart, Aaron Cresswell and Carl Jenkinson.' Enner Valencia found himself substituted at half-time by Diafra Sakho, and Allardyce explained why. 'Enner was disappointed but it was the right thing to do,' he continued.

"When Charlie Austin left Poole Town to join Swindon in 2009, a group of 16 fans went to a local bookies and placed a tidy sum on him scoring for England one day. Jem Racing gave them 50-1 odds, fairly slim for a player who joined a League One side, and they handed over £155. They look on course for a payout given Austin’s form for Queens Park Rangers. The 25-year-old became the highest scoring Englishman in the Premier League, behind only Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa in the overall chart, after his hat-trick against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday took him to 11 goals for the season. But Austin’s value to the non-League side stretches beyond the £7,750 the group are set to receive. Money the club earned from goals and appearances since he left has enabled them to carry out work on their Tatnam ground, essential in winning two promotions. VIDEO Scroll down to watch RARE FOOTAGE Charlie Austin scores for Poole Town . Queens Park rangers striker Charlie Austin playing for former club Poole Town in Dorset in 2008-09 . Following his hat-trick against West Brom, Austin is the top English goal scorer in the Premier League . A young Austin was offered to both Poole and their rivals Wimborne Town but only the former gave him a trial . Directors at Poole knew the add-ons they had written into his Swindon transfer could have amounted to nothing had Austin, then 19, faded into obscurity. He scored 46 goals in 46 games in his first season at the club then 18 in 11 before the move. Coaching staff at Poole noticed improvement when he started training with Bournemouth ahead of his second campaign. Austin netted twice in a 3-0 friendly against them and manager Eddie Howe liked what he saw. But Bournemouth were under a transfer embargo, so Austin trained with their first team and was released to Poole for matches. That was until Swindon, who had Danny Wilson in charge, beat them to his signature. In a fitting send-off, Austin scored five goals in his final Poole game against Portsmouth side Moneyfields, in front of a home crowd of 88. ‘Swindon didn’t want to pay a fee, they didn’t feel they had to, which was insulting,’ Poole commercial director Mark Bumford explained. ‘They agreed a deal with add-ons for appearance and goal bonuses. He could’ve disappeared into their reserves, but soon started scoring goals and got into the first team.’ Austin scored a remarkable 64 goals in 57 games while playing for Poole Town . Austin was said to very confident and sure of himself at Poole, where he was well-liked by his team-mates . Austin headed in his side's winner three minutes from the end of normal time to seal the win and his hat-trick . Word spread among Poole fans that the club were receiving money every time Austin played 10 games or scored 10 goals for Swindon. On matchdays they would listen out for how their departed hero was getting on. ‘Charlie scored again, Charlie scored again,’ would spread around the ground. They may not have been aware how important the money would be to the club. At Poole, Austin and his team-mates were playing home matches on a school field in the Wessex League — the ninth tier of English football. They won the title in his debut campaign and again the following year. Both times they were unable to climb a league due to their ground not being enclosed. Oakdale South Road Middle School — now Oakdale Junior School — and Poole Borough Council would not allow them to improve it. But the club credit Austin’s goals for getting the ball rolling. ‘After that the council and school allowed us to enclose it,’ Bumford said. ‘Then we started receiving money from the add-ons for Charlie and it allowed us to finish work on the ground. We won the league a third season in a row and got promoted.’ QPR striker Austin poses with the match ball after his hat-trick against West Brom at Loftus Road . The QPR striker recently went back to Poole for a fundraising event but did not play for the club . Poole commercial director Mark Bumford in the stand paid for by Austin through transfer add-ons . They built a stand, a barrier around the pitch and floodlights. It took them two seasons to win promotion to the Southern Premier League, where they are level with leaders Redditch United — but with five games in hand. They spent £260,000 from Austin add-ons to ensure the ground is the required standard for promotion. ‘That’s the end of the Charlie money,’ Bumford added. ‘Tatnam is a different place now.’ It’s a stroke of luck he played there at all. When his family left Hungerford for Bournemouth, his father, Fred, and grandfather, Ozzy, looked for a team of a similar level to the local club where he was playing. They left messages with Poole and rivals Wimborne Town. Poole take great delight that they offered him a trial and he went on to transform their club, while Wimborne never called them back. ‘He was very confident,’ Bumford said. ‘He was a bit of a poser and had a swagger about him. But he was popular with team-mates and a fans’ favourite.’ In September he returned for a benefit game for former Poole strike partner Andy Culliford, who suffers from motor neurone disease. His importance at QPR is such he was unable to play. He has scored more than half their goals this season and, with Roy Hodgson keeping watch, an England call-up is surely not far away. You wouldn’t bet against it. Austin joined Poole from Hungerford and was at Kintbury before that, he had impressive records at both .

"Lewis Hamilton has hailed Rory McIlroy as 'phenomenal' ahead of their Sunday night showdown for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award. McIlroy has long been a clear favourite for the honour given his wins this year in The Open and USPGA, as well as helping Europe to victory in the Ryder Cup. But after claiming his second Formula One world title a fortnight ago in Abu Dhabi, so Hamilton's odds have shortened considerably and he is pushing McIlroy to the wire. 'I'm excited to be going,' said Hamilton ahead of flying into London from Los Angeles, where he has held a number of business meetings over recent days. Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton says he's excited for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards . Hamilton returns to London for the ceremony after spending time in the United States . 'I went in 2007 and 2008 and I'm certain that back then I didn't even have one hundredth of the support I have right now. I went in 2007 and 2008 and I'm certain that back then I didn't even have one hundredth of the support I have right now. 'That support has really grown over the years. The fans have just been amazing, incredible. 'A lot of Brits have come up to me and told me how proud they are, that they are huge fans.' Hamilton recognises what McIlroy has achieved this year, and ahead of the SPOTY event at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow showed true sportsmanship to tell him as much this past week. 'I messaged Rory, wishing him all the best for it and told him I'll see him this Sunday,' added Hamilton. 'I also congratulated him on an incredible year because he has been phenomenal, and at his age too.' After finishing runner-up in his F1 debut year of 2007 to Joe Calzaghe and again in his first title-winning season of 2008 to Sir Chris Hoy, Hamilton is expecting to finish second for a third time, not that that concerns him. Hamilton describes fellow nominee Rory McIlroy's year as 'phenomenal' with the Open's Claret Jug among the Northern Irishman's prizes that have made him favourite for the award . Hamilton holds his F1 championship trophy after it was presented in Doha by FIA President Jean Todt (right) 'I remember '08 and losing to a Sir, so I didn't mind that,' said a joking Hamilton. 'But I don't think I have to win anything more than I have, or to show what I've achieved, or to prove how much support I have. 'I know I'm aware of the support I have. I never thought I'd have people tuning in to their TVs or turning up at races to support me. McIlroy poses with the Wanamaker trophy after his one-stroke victory in the PGA Championship . 'And this isn't like I'm going for the world championship and I'm dying to win it with everything in my power. 'Instead this is one of those events where you feel quite privileged to be amongst all the great stars also there. 'I know it's going to be a good experience being there - although I do anticipate me being runner-up again!' After what has been a whirlwind past two weeks for Hamilton following his championship triumph, SPOTY represents the last awards event prior to him finally taking a break. 'The last couple of weeks have been pretty intense, pretty crazy with interviews, doing stuff for Mercedes, various other awards shows. 'I've not really had any time for myself, but I'm still on a high, and the reception and response has been amazing. 'But after these awards I'm gone. 'Every year you have to be very selfish with your time. I believe you have to be because it is such a long year. 'You have to get away as soon as possible, have a couple of weeks' break and then start training again just before Christmas for the next season. That's what I like to do. 'This year the BBC Sports Personality has shifted everything later, so my break starts a lot later than usual, and now I can't wait.' There is a 10-strong shortlist with McIlroy tipped to win the public vote and become the first golfer to win the award since Nick Faldo in 1989.

"Whatever else gets said about Jose Mourinho, he certainly has an acute sense of timing. Not only because he claimed Diego Costa is unfairly treated by referees having just watched him collect a booking for diving but also that he did so while Chris Foy, the latest official in question, was nearby. It led to a rather amusing scene in a Stamford Bridge corridor following Chelsea’s win. Diego Costa broke his four-game barren run by scoring Chelsea's second goal at Stamford Bridge . Costa (left) is booked by referee Chris Foy at Stamford Bridge on Saturday against Hull City . 3 - Chelsea have now had three bookings for simulation this season - the most in the League ahead of Manchester City and Sunderland (both two). Mourinho had just been asked if he was frustrated about Costa’s treatment by officials, a follow-up question to his earlier assertion that only two of the Spain striker’s seven yellow cards this season - two for simulation - were warranted. That’s when Mourinho spotted Foy. ‘You have to ask Mr Foy,’ Mourinho said. ‘Mr Foy, tell the guys please. Diego Costa is crying because you gave him a yellow card! And these guys are asking me why.’ Foy reached into his pocket and offered Mourinho a tissue. It was intended and accepted as a light-hearted gesture. Costa (centre) acknowledges his team-mates after securing a victory that keeps Chelsea three points clear . But that should not disguise what was a worrying pattern on Saturday where two Chelsea players - Willian and Costa - were booked for simulation and a third, Gary Cahill, escaped what should have been his second yellow card after an embarrassing tumble in the area. Hull manager Steve Bruce was furious about that reprieve, though Mourinho feels he is also entitled to be bemused, such is his belief that Costa is the victim of unfair perceptions from his time at Atletico Madrid. Mourinho said: ‘I remember two (of Costa’s yellows) that are understandable and fair. Against Newcastle and Liverpool. Other times he touches one guy and it is a yellow card. Everything he does is a yellow card. Hull boss Steve Bruce speaks with Chelsea's Jose Mourinho as they teams go toe-to-toe at Stamford Bridge . ‘Why? I don’t know. I think when he was at Atletico he created a certain image and people don’t believe that he can change. People don’t understand that he is intelligent enough to understand and to change - because he (has) changed.’ He added: ‘In England, normally referees are very good. And more than the referees, the fans - they are very fair in that analysis. They don’t like the elbows, the spitting. And he learned. He had lessons on it. Not just me or my staff, also people like (Cesc) Fabregas, (Cesar) Azpilicueta - the ones that speak Spanish well with him and they have his ear. The guy is clean.’ Frank Lampard put City 1-0 up to match Thierry Henry's all-time record in the Premier League of 175 goals . Lampard runs away in celebration after giving City the lead at the King Power Stadium on Saturday . Shortly after, Foy came over with his tissue. Mourinho might have had greater cause to use it over the loss of Frank Lampard to Manchester City, though he insists it was the right decision to let him go. He said: ‘The project is to prepare for the next 10 years, not for the next year. We made the right decision. You can argue, “You have John Terry and Didier Drogba”. Different. Drogba is a striker that is coming to help and support and JT is the best central defender in English football and it doesn’t matter how old he is. The nucleus of the team has to be developed. If you have a big player like Frank we would stop the development of the other guys.’ Eden Hazard is gifted a free header inside the Hull penalty area and heads home Chelsea's opener . Willian (left) is booked by Foy for simulation - one of two Chelsea players yellow carded for diving . The victory was some way short of Chelsea’s highest standards this season and Mourinho admitted: ‘I have to agree  we have had many special performances this season and in this (game) we just had moments.’ Bruce, meanwhile, has accepted he made a mistake in taking Hatem Ben Arfa on loan from Newcastle. The Frenchman has made only eight appearances and is believed to be training alone in France. Bruce said: ‘Sometimes transfers work out and sometimes they don’t. I can’t see there being a future. There has been no fall-out - he’s been omitted from the squad because when you are up against it, I believe you need to show a bit of resilience and unfortunately Hatem sees it differently.’ Curtis Davies remonstrates with referee Chris Foy after Gary Cahill's apparent dive .","Chelsea beat Hull City 2-0 at Stamford Bridge  on Saturday .

The match at Goodison Park is scheduled to take place at 5.30pm on Saturday February 7 and be shown on Sky Sports. Merseyside Police have raised their concerns about the timing of the match, which has directly resulted in it being elevated to a Category C fixture with a high risk of disorder. Everton and Liverpool are due to kick-off at 5.30pm at Goodison Park in February's Merseyside derby . Liverpool's Mario Balotelli (right) has an effort at goal during his side's 1-1 draw with Everton in September . The police, supported by Liverpool City Council's Licensing Committee, want the match to start earlier. 'Merseyside Police do not support this fixture being played at 17.30 on Saturday February 7 2015 and reiterate our position that this fixture should have a kick-off time of no later than 1.30pm on a weekend,' said the police in a report to a special meeting of the ground safety advisory committee. Everton informed the Premier League of the police's objections on December 9 and the issue will be discussed on Tuesday afternoon by the council's licensing committee, which is set to also write to the Premier League with the proviso it 'will take legal advice on all appropriate options to enforce the position' in the event of no change of kick-off time being determined.

The police report stressed there was no specific intelligence indicating any organised disorder is planned but stated the wider implications of a late kick-off meant they had to take action now. 'I firmly believe that, the police, the clubs, and the city council have a responsibility to minimise the likelihood of those problems and their impact, not only on supporters within the footprint of the stadium, but also the wider community,' said the report. 'An evening kick-off time at a weekend is undoubtedly the most challenging and gives us the least chance of meeting our responsibilities. 'It is for this reason we, the police have specifically requested that this fixture should have a lunchtime kick-off.' Â .","Everton host Liverpool on Saturday February 7 with kick-off at 5.30pm .

"QPR boss Harry Redknapp expects in-form striker Charlie Austin to be offered a new contract but denies Rangers are fighting off interest from other clubs. Austin is the joint highest English goalscorer in the Barclays Premier League this season having scored seven goals, including the winner in a 3-2 victory over Leicester on Saturday. The 25-year-old moved to Loftus Road in August 2013 and has only 18 months to run on his current deal. QPR striker Charlie Austin has adjusted quickly to the Premier League, scoring seven times this season . Austin (centre), pursued by team-mate Leroy Fer (left), celebrates scoring the winner against Leicester . 'I'm sure the club would (like to extend his contract),' Redknapp said. 'I don't get involved in that, it's up to the chairman and (chief executive) Phil Beard. 'I'm sure everyone wants to keep Charlie here and I'm sure they'll be sitting down and talking to him.' Austin's scintillating form, which has seen him score five goals in his last five matches, has reportedly alerted the likes of Tottenham and Liverpool. Redknapp, however, insists Rangers have not fielded any enquiries for their star man and insists Austin still has to prove himself in the top flight. 'We've not had any enquiries from anyone else as far as I know,' Redknapp said. 'He's come into the Premier League and only played a dozen games. 'He's got a long, long way to go still - he knows that. Both Liverpool and Tottenham have been credited with an interest in former Burnley and Swindon man Austin . QPR boss Harry Redknapp insists the club have not received any enquiries about Austin . 'He's full of confidence, playing well, he's happy here and he's just got to keep going.' Only six years ago, Austin was playing for Poole Town in the Sydenhams Football League - the ninth tier of the English Football League. He scored 37 goals in 38 appearances for Poole that season and the former Burnley and Swindon forward has never hit less than 17 in a campaign since. 'He's going well at the moment but he needs to keep going well, it's only early in the season,' Redknapp said. 'He's a player who needs to get 20 goals this year. 'He's capable of getting 20 goals, he's been great for us and he's a great lad as well. 'I'm sure he's very happy here.' Despite Austin' excellent start, QPR are keen to bolster their attacking options in January with FC Toronto striker Jermain Defoe still on Redknapp's radar. Redknapp has confirmed that he is interested in a January deal for Toronto striker Jermain Defoe (left) 'It depends how much it costs and what the deal is for Defoe,' Redknapp explained. 'There wouldn't be too many clubs who could afford him - he has a great contract where he is and it's going to be difficult to afford that. 'I love him as a player and a lad but it depends what the deal is.' Redknapp added: 'We've got three strikers and they've all been excellent but in an ideal world you need four. 'You want to be able to change a game and freshen it up so that's something we'll look at if we can find the right person.' QPR visit seventh-placed Swansea on Tuesday, looking to climb out of the bottom three for the first time since September. 'We'll have to go there and work very hard to stay with them,' Redknapp said. 'They play some great football, we know it'll be a tough game but we need an away win so we've got to be positive and believe we can go and get it.'","QPR striker Charlie Austin has scored seven goals in the Premier League .

"Marseille missed the chance to extend their lead at the top of Ligue 1, a defeat to Monaco preventing them from taking a major advantage over PSG. With the champions having suffered a shock defeat away to strugglers Guingamp, Marseille arrived in the principality knowing a win would take them four points clear at the top of the table. But a goalkeeping mistake from the usually dependable Steve Mandanda saw the league leaders slip up, as Bernardo Silva took advantage to score the game's only goal. Bernardo Silva is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring the games only goal for Monaco . Steve Mandanda cannot believe his own mistake as Monaco's goalscorer Silva celebrates with Andrea Raggi . Brice Djadjedje escapes the tackle of Monaco defender Andrea Raggi, only to see his shot well saved .

Subs not used: Aloe, Morel, Samba, Omrani, Romao . Booked: Lemina 45, Mendy . Referee: Tony Chapron . In a game of few clear-cut chances, it was always likely to take a mistake, or a moment of magic to break the deadlock, and in the end the winner came from a combination of the two. A lovely move down Monaco's right hand side, the best of the match, opened up the away defence, with Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco and Nabil Dirar combining beautifully. But, when Anthony Martial cut the ball back for Silva, he was afforded an inexcusable amount of space 15 yards out by a Marseille defence that had been bamboozled by a simple stepover. Even after that, Silva's shot should not have slipped through Mandanda's hands as easily as it did, the keeper palming the strike into his own net. Marseille deserved little more, creating few opportunities despite seeing plenty of the ball. Marcelo Bielsa's side had come out of the blocks quickly, dominating possession and territory in the first half without finding a way past Danijel Subasic in the Monaco goal. Mario Lemina gets up well to connect with a Florian Thauvin cross, but his header drifted just wide . Djadjedje holds off a tackle from Monaco midfielder Yannick Ferreira Carrasco during a goalless first half . Marcelo Bielsa makes a tactical adjustment but his side were unable to find a response to going behind . Florian Thauvin, a constant threat down the right hand side, set the tone when his ninth minute cross was headed into the side netting by Andre-Pierre Gignac. Soon after the winger produced another sumptuous delivery to the far post, only for Mario Lemina to see his powerful header drift past the far post having leapt highest. The hosts didn't create too many chances, but they did come closest to breaking the deadlock in the first 45 minutes. Martial, leading the line in the absence of Dimitar Berbatov, took advantage of some sloppy defending to smash the ball past Mandanda, only to see his strike rattle the crossbar. Andre-Pierre Gignac, who headed wide early on for Marseille, is tackled by Monaco captain Jeremy Toulalan . Anthony Martial came closest to breaking the deadlock early on when he rattled the crossbar from range . Mandanda was also forced into action by Ferreira-Carrasco, whose long-range drive needed a fingertip save to keep the scores level. However, having survived those scares, Marseille should have taken the lead just before the break. After Subasic had made a smart save to deny Brice Dja Djedje, the visitors were gifted a glorious chance from the resultant corner. Non-existent marking allowed Rod Fanni a free header from just five yards, but the defender contrived to head the ball high and away from the goal, with the goal gaping. And the league leaders were punished for their wastefulness after the break, when Silva took advantage of some ropey defending and a goalkeeping error to score the crucial goal.","Bernardo Silva opens the scoring after 67 mins after Mandanda mistake .

"Unbeaten Kubrat Pulev believes he's the man to end Wladimir Klitschko's reign as world heavyweight champion when they face off on Saturday in Hamburg. Pulev is the mandatory challenger of the International Boxing Federation and is undefeated in 20 fights. Klitschko has been ruling the heavyweight division since 2006 and has not lost in 10 years. His WBA belt is also on the line, along with the minor WBO and IBO titles. Wladimir Klitschko (left) and Kubrat Pulev face off during their official weigh-in in Hamburg, Germany . NEW DATE . The fight was originally scheduled for September 6, but was postponed after Klitschko hurt a bicep in training. Pulev cast doubt on the seriousness of the injury, just one of the many frictions between the two camps. Klitschko's management refused to allow Pulev's entire staff to attend the pre-match news conference - and Pulev skipped it. Pulev has also complained about the lack of doping controls during Klitschko's training, Pulev's German management turned down Klitschko's contract for the fight and instead signed a generic IBF contract. They have also argued about the gloves to be used. Pulev, pictured on the scales, is unbeaten in his 20 fights and believes he is the man to beat Klitschko . TALE OF THE TAPE . Pulev, a 33-year-old Bulgarian, is shorter but usually heavier than Klitschko. Pulev is 1.94 metres tall, while Klitschko is 1.98 metres. Klitschko is 38, a Ukrainian who spends his time between Germany and California. Both are European-style fighters, relying on jabs to soften up their opponents. Pulev is known as 'the Cobra,' while Klitschko goes by the nickname of 'Dr Steelhammer.' Pulev is likely to seek to come inside, something Klitschko doesn't like. Klitschko has dominated the heavyweight division for eight years and holds the WBA, WBO and IBO titles . RECORDS . Pulev is undefeated in 20 fights, including 11 knockouts, and has beaten taller opponents. Klitschko is 62-3, with 52 knockouts. His last defeat was in 2004 against Lamon Brewster. This is Klitschko's 26th championship fight and 17th defence of the IBF belt. He has won his last 20 contests, and his eight-year reign, is second only to Joe Louis' 11 years. The pair shake hands during a tense weigh-in at the Elbe shopping centre on Friday afternoon . LIFESTYLES . Klitschko is the glamour man of boxing, a multilingual holder of a doctorate, who is expecting a child next month with American actress Hayden Panettiere. While he trains at a luxury resort in the Austrian Alps, Pulev works out at a former school gym on the outskirts of the former East Berlin, and lives in a three-star hotel owned by a Bulgarian friend. Pulev says boxing is not a 'business' for him, but 'the meaning of life, a dream, a mania.' Klitschko and Pulev will do battle at the O2 World Arena in Hamburg on Saturday evening . THE FIGHT . Pulev may be the most serious challenge Klitschko has faced in years. Klitschko is vastly more experienced but Pulev is an accomplished fighter, with youth on his side. 'I am the man of the future, his time is over,' Pulev said in the build-up. Pulev is likely to take the fight to Klitschko and to be the more active fighter. Klitschko will rely on his trademark jab, the big straight right, and will clinch to blunt Pulev's attacks.","Wladimir Klitschko defends his WBA, WBO and IBO titles on Saturday .

"Neil Warnock remains convinced Crystal Palace will not be dragged into a relegation dogfight despite a run of one win in 10 games. The Palace boss admitted 'we could and should have won' the last five games in the wake of Saturday's dismal 1-1 draw with Stoke at Selhurst Park. Palace's only win since September was a 3-1 triumph over Liverpool, but since then the south Londoners have drawn with Swansea, Tottenham and Stoke, and lost at home to Aston Villa. Neil Warnock is confident Crystal Palace won't be relegated despite falling to one point from the bottom three . Palace captain Mile Jedinak congratulates James McArthur after he scored the opener against Stoke . The Eagles now sit just one point off the relegation zone, but Warnock is unfazed by his side's recent missed opportunities. 'I still think we've got enough to be okay,' said Warnock. 'I don't think you can write us off against anybody. 'That's five games where we could and should have won really. 'So we've just got to convert more of our opportunities. 'We have got to create chances, get two or three players in the transfer window as quickly as possible, and then take it forward.' James McArthur claimed his first goal for Palace in 15 appearances since his switch from Wigan, but Peter Crouch struck almost immediately to level for Stoke. Neither side could then carve out another clear opening in a dour contest between two teams struggling for fluency. Marouane Chamakh led Palace's forward line against Stoke, linking play well but never offering a credible goal threat. McArthur (second left) puts Palace ahead of Stoke on Saturday but Warncok's side couldn't hold on . Peter Crouch's goal means Palace have just one win in the last 10 matches . The Morocco striker picked up a thigh problem that could sideline him for several weeks, and Warnock has made no secret of his desire to sign a striker in January. Palace have only mustered three goals in their last four games, but Warnock is unconcerned by his side's lack of finishing power. The former Sheffield United boss is adamant Palace are still heading in the right direction, claiming he is satisfied with the Eagles' creativity. 'The problem is when you're not creating and you're not playing well,' said Warnock. 'You're really snookered then. 'But I feel we've got good balance, decent creativity and we've just not taken our opportunities. 'And we're coming across some good goalkeepers at the minute, so I've got no complaints from the lads at all.'","Crystal Palace have won just once in their last 10 matches .

"Paul Pogba impressed team-mates in Qatar after scoring in training from behind the goal.

"Napoli forward Marek Hamsik admitted that his side fear Juventus, but insisted the Serie A champions can be beaten in Monday's Supercoppa Italiana clash in Doha, Qatar. The meeting of the Coppa Italia winners and Scudetto holders is a rematch of the 2012 final, which saw Juventus come from behind twice to secure a 3-2 win in extra time. The Old Lady have begun this campaign in ominous form, and currently sit top of Serie A, three points clear of their nearest challengers, Roma. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the Napoli team recreate the famous 'Klinsmann' dive . Marek Hamsik has admitted that Juventus represent tough opposition ahead of Napoli's Super Cup clash . The Slovakian does not have fond memories of the last time Napoli took on Juventus in the competition . After a run of one goal in his last ten appearances, Hamsik will be hoping to notch against Juventus in Qatar . Napoli sit third with 27 points despite only picking up one win from their previous five league matches. And ahead of Monday's encounter, Hamsik has revealed that despite Juventus' form making them a formidable opponent, they can be beaten on the day. 'The Super Cup is extremely important. I love the idea of lifting the trophy,' Hamsik said. 'Juventus are to be feared, as they know how to win and the team is full of champions, but this is a one-off game so anything can happen. 'If we beat Juve, it'll be hugely satisfying for us and our fans, sending a positive image of Napoli and the city. 'We can do it if we replicate the performance against Roma.' The Slovakian also admits the clash in China two years ago is not easy to forget, and still feels regret that Napoli lost the tie. 'I've scored against Juve several times and each one of them was wonderful,' Hamsik added. 'Above all, I remember the double in Turin. We hadn't won there for more than 20 years. There was also the goal in the Coppa Italia Final, our first trophy together. 'This time we're playing on an international stage, like we were in Beijing for the Super Cup in 2012. We shouldn't have lost that game, not like that. It was a hard match and we could've won.'","Coppa Italia winners Napoli face league champions Juventus in Qatar .

"Juventus will be aiming for a record seventh Italian Super Cup title when they face Napoli at the Qatar on Monday looking for their third straight triumph. The two teams have met twice in the annual showdown between the Italian champions and the domestic cup winners with one victory apiece. The Naples club demolished Juve 5-1 in their only Super Cup victory in 1990 when Diego Maradona was the team's inspiration, before Juve won a controversial game 4-2 in 2012 in China. When Juventus and Napoli met in this fixture two years ago the match was embroiled in controversy . Marek Hamsik says his side know how to hurt Juventus ahead of Napoli's Super Cup clash with the champions . Antonio Conte's side got a fortunate 74th minute penalty in Beijing when trailing 2-1 before Napoli had two players sent off late in the game and then scored an own goal in extra time. Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentis was so appalled by the refereeing that he did not allow his club to take part in the trophy ceremony and they will be determined to avenge that loss. 'We know how to hurt them,' Napoli captain Marek Hamsik told reporters on Sunday, the day after a 0-0 draw at Roma in Serie A. 'If we play with the same intensity we displayed against Roma we have a good chance to beat them. We usually don't fail in these kind of matches.' Napoli, then with Edinson Cavani leading the line, had two men sent off in the 2012 Super Cup . Juventus won narrowly in 2012, and went on to defend their title in Rome last year . Napoli beat Fiorentina 3-1 to win their fifth Coppa Italia last season and earn a place in the annual Super Cup clash with the winners of the Scudetto, who are having a successful season. Serie A leaders Juve have already booked a last 16 spot in the Champions League, where they will face Borussia Dortmund over two legs in February, and are now targeting another trophy. 'This is our third goal of the season, from a chronological standpoint,' Conte's successor as Juve manager Massimiliano Allegri told a news conference on Sunday. 'The first one was to maintain first place in the (Serie A) table and the second was to qualify for the knockout stage in the Champions League.' Conte's resignation before the start of the season was a shcok but it has not changed Juve's winning habits. Napoli boss Rafa Benitez casts his eye of his players as they train in Qatar ahead of the clash . They have a three-point lead over AS Roma in the domestic standings and are 12 points clear of third-placed Napoli as they bid for a fourth straight Italian league title. 'We were curious to see how solid our group was,' said captain and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. 'We wanted to show that our results didn't depend on one person only. 'Our former manager had done an incredible job but without the club and the sense of responsibility that we as players have, we would have never achieved these results.' However, Napoli know anything can happen in a one-off game and manager Rafa Benitez is confident his side can upset the club known as the 'Old Lady' of Italian football. 'It's true that they are ahead in the table but in a final the only things that matter are desire, mental strength and intensity,' Benitez told a news conference on Sunday.","Last year's Serie A champions take on Coppa Italia winners on Monday .

"Adam Johnson admits he must be the most hated man in Newcastle after his late goal condemned Alan Pardew's side to a fourth successive derby defeat for the first time in their history. The Sunderland winger, who scored in the two previous 3-0 wins over the Magpies at St James' Park, struck in the 90th minute to settle a rip-roaring encounter which might have gone either way until his intervention. It was no more than Gus Poyet's men deserved after creating the better chances on an afternoon when they collected just their third Barclays Premier League win of the season. Sunderland winger Adam Johnson scores a late goal to seal a 1-0 win against rivals Newcastle United . Johnson celebrates his side's victory in front of the travelling supporters at St James' Park . 'Three years in a row - they must hate me here, but I'm delighted,' Johnson told Sky Sports 1. 'Three wins here and three clean sheets. We can't ask for much more. 'I was a bit disappointed as I should have scored earlier on so if I had missed that one I would have been gutted tonight. I took my time and set myself and thankfully it went in.' Johnson revealed that despite the huge Tyne-Wear rivalry, St James' Park is one of his favourite grounds. 'It's a personal favourite of mine to be honest. It's a great ground, great atmosphere and we all seem to rise to the occasion here,' the 27-year-old said. Johnson is mobbed by his team-mates after scoring a dramatic winner against Alan Pardew's side . Black Cats boss Gus Poyet celebrates wildly after Johnson's clinical strike past Jak Alnwick . '(The win) is massive for us. It gives us a great boost and it's been coming in recent weeks and we did well but today was the end of some hard work.' Sunderland midfielder Sebastian Larsson praised Johnson and is hopeful the victory will help to ignite the Black Cats' season. 'I think we've created enough to win games but couldn't find the back of the net. But all credit to Johnno,' the Sweden international said. 'There was no doubt in my mind that he was going to tuck that away. We deserved the win. 'That's the best way to win games, especially derby games away from home. We needed a win. Hopefully that will kick our season off and we'll push forward.'","Adam Johnson scored a 90th minute winner at St James' Park on Sunday .

"There may have been a deliberate effort by both clubs to kill the poison on the streets, but such pacifism certainly did not extend to the pitch as a fiery Tyne-Wear derby was won at the death by Sunderland’s Adam Johnson. The fans – in a joint tribute to the two Newcastle fans killed in the MH17 disaster – had applauded each other. The players, meanwhile, kicked each other. Had it not been for Johnson’s 90th-minute intervention – his third straight goal at St James’ Park – then this derby would have been defined by the seven yellow cards issued by Anthony Taylor. Adam Johnson wheels away to celebrate after scoring Sunderland's winner against Newcastle on Sunday . Referee Anthony Taylor speaks with Connor Wickham and Fabricio Coloccini during the Tyne-Wear derby . There were reports of police having to separate rival fans before the game, but it was Mr Taylor who very quickly took on the role of law enforcer inside the ground. That the game expired with 22 men on the pitch owed a little to his strict handling of a ferocious first half, but also to his leniency after the break. Lee Cattermole took just 30 seconds to make his mark on the contest – and Daryl Janmaat – with a robust block which upended the Newcastle defender. It was a cute – if cynical – tactic, for Taylor was never going to produce a card at such a juvenile juncture. Sunderland centre back Sebastian Coates, on loan from Liverpool, is booked by Taylor . Fast forward 60 seconds, however, and Sebastian Coates was not so fortunate, his chop on Ayoze Perez drawing the game’s first yellow. Fabricio Coloccini joined him eight minutes later when his studs landed in the back of Steven Fletcher – the same Steven Fletcher who has been carrying a back injury of late. The skipper was booked but, had such an obvious offence occurred the other side of half-time, it may well have been a red card. Of all the candidates to see red then perhaps Magpie midfielder Cheick Tiote ranked at the top of the list. That he collected his caution for such a needless climb over Connor Wickham served to highlight his favouritism in such a market – it also landed him with a one-game ban. Former Black Cats man Jack Colback was next into Taylor’s notebook when his high boot floored Jordi Gomez. Cattermole sensed blood – and the red residing in the referee’s pocket – and duly threw himself to the floor under minimal contact from Colback moments later. His former team-mate wasn’t best pleased and Taylor wasn’t impressed either. Newcastle midfielder Cheick Tiote (left) looked like the candidate most likely to pick up a red card . Newcastle midfielder Jack Colback is grounded following a challenge from Sunderland's Jordi Gomez . Neither was the whistler enamoured by Sunderland winger Wickham when he clattered into Jak Alnwick as the rookie goalkeeper came to fist clear inside the six-yard area. The upshot: yellow. Colback, though, was fortunate to stay on the field moments later when, having tripped Larsson as he scampered clear down the left, Taylor chose to penalise Coloccini for an earlier infringement – it kept the contest at 11 apiece heading into the break. Cattermole – a surprise absentee from Taylor’s pad to this point – became the sixth player in the book when, having been outsprinted by Perez, he took a very deliberate swipe to ground the Spaniard. He failed, but the intent was enough. There was no doubting O’Shea’s entry soon after, the visiting captain scything down Sissoko with the midfielder in full flight by the touchline. Newcastle fans look on and sing as Sunderland supporters arrive at the stadium for the Premier League clash . Newcastle fans gather outside St James' Park prior to Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby against Sunderland . His opposite number Coloccini should have been dismissed for a trip which felled Will Buckley, but a crowd of bodies saved the Argentine. Newcastle defender Paul Dummett had escaped caution but, as Johnson skipped forward in the last minute, perhaps he wishes he’d taken the winger out on halfway. Ten seconds later and Johnson was smashing the winning goal to spark mass celebration high in the Leazes End for the third season in a row.","Sunderland defeated Newcastle thanks to Adam Johnson's late winner .

"Manuel Pellegrini is confident James Milner his Manchester City team-mate Joe Hart and commit his future to the Premier League champions. Hart recently put pen to paper on a new long-term deal, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2018-19 season. And now the former Malaga boss wants Milner to do the same. James Milner is in the final year of his contract with Premier League champions Manchester City . Manuel Pellegrini is hopeful that the England midfielder will follow Joe Hart's example and sign a new deal . Asked if he expected Milner to stay, Pellegrini said: 'I think so. There are some differences that can be arranged. 'We are talking with James. It is not easy for all the players to sign a new contract. There are a lot of things to talk, to decide, discuss. I hope finally James will sign his contract. 'The same as with Joe Hart - he wants to stay and the club wants to keep him.' Milner, 28, is in the final season of his current deal and would be free to talk to other clubs from next month. His future became the subject of speculation due to his limited action last season but his prominent role this term - featuring in all but two matches - has changed the picture. The other major contract speculation at the Etihad Stadium at present concerns Frank Lampard's loan from sister club New York City, which is due to expire at the end of the month. Hart has committed his long-term future to Manchester City by signing a new deal with the club . City's director of football Txiki Begiristain shaking hands with Hart after he signed the deal . Pellegrini hopes to keep the influential 36-year-old until the end of the season and also claimed last week that Lampard wanted to stay longer. It might be that Pellegrini has to settle for a shorter arrangement - for an extra month or two - but no decisions have yet been made. Pellegrini said: 'It is not just our decision. If you ask me if I want Frank to stay, of course. He is a very important player for our squad and he is playing very well, as the top player he is. 'Maybe in the next days we will be sure but I cannot be 100 per cent at this moment.' Pellegrini's most immediate concern is overcoming the absence of his captain Vincent Kompany and all three of his frontline strikers for the visit of Crystal Palace in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday. The Chilean manager also expressed a desire to keep Frank Lampard at City until the end of the season . Lampard is due to join up with New York City FC after Christmas but his loan deal could be extended . Kompany suffered a recurrence of a hamstring injury in his comeback match at Leicester last week while forward Edin Dzeko hurt his calf in the warm-up. Frontmen Sergio Aguero and Stevan Jovetic were already sidelined. The lack of forward options could mean another opportunity for 18-year-old Jose Angel Pozo or a change of system to utilise a midfielder such as Milner, David Silva or Samir Nasri in an advanced position. Pellegrini said: 'The strikers, the three of them are out for tomorrow. We will try to play in another way. 'I know that we play against a team that defend very well also so we will see what is the best solution to play without them.' Victory for City by four goals or more would take them to the top of the table ahead of current leaders Chelsea's trip to Stoke on Monday.","Joe Hart has signed a new deal with Manchester City until 2018-19 .

"On what turned out to be a rather mild Monday night in Stoke, Chelsea picked up a crucial 2-0 win which ensures that Jose Mourinho's side are top of the Premier League at Christmas. It means the Stamford Bridge club have lost just one of their last 20 league matches played on a Monday, having won 12 and drawn seven. But they still have have much work to do to catch Manchester United in a league table ranked by Premier League games won on the first day of the week. John Terry (left) and his Chelsea team-mates celebrate their victory against Stoke on Monday night . Cesc Fabregas celebrates his goal for Chelsea in the 2-0 victory at the Britannia Stadium in Stoke . While Chelsea currently sit in eighth position, it is United who are kings of the 'Monday club', having won 38 of their 55 games, a win percentage of 69.1 per cent. Considering United went through a recent 14-month gap - from August 2013 to October 2014 - without playing a league match on a Monday night, it is a decent feat to still be top of the table. Although Chelsea have played just 42 matches on a Monday, their win percentage is considerably lower having won 19 (45.2 per cent). Arsenal sit in second place with 30 wins in 55 games (54.5 per cent), while Manchester City are in third with 27 victories in 60 (45 per cent). Tottenham Hotspur have played the most matches on a Monday of any side in Premier League history, although they are yet to experience one this season.

Arsene Wenger's Arsenal team are second in the table with 30 wins in 55 Monday matches . West Ham are no strangers to a Monday match, having played 64. However, they have only picked up 18 wins, hence a disappointing percentage of 28.1 per cent. West Brom may look ahead to their match against Everton at Goodison Park on Monday January 19 with trepidation. The Baggies have a woeful record on a Monday with a win percentage of just 10.5 per cent (two in 19), which is the worst percentage of any side who has registered at least one win. Sunderland also have a poor record of five wins in 32 (15.6 per cent), while Hull are still to win a match on a Monday after six attempts. Bear in mind that these teams are likely to face one of the bigger clubs in one of Sky Sports' showpiece TV slots. West Brom manager Alan Irvine (centre) will be hoping to improve his club's Monday night record when they visit Goodison Park in January . A special mention must go to Sheffield Wednesday. The Owls have an impressive record of 15 wins in 24 Monday Premier League matches (62.5 per cent), although they have not played in the top flight since being relegated in 2000. The next Monday night match we look forward to is Liverpool against Swansea at Anfield on December 29.

"La Liga champions Atletico Madrid have become the mirror image of Diego Simeone as a well-organised and hard-working team with a fierce commitment and a strong rebellious streak. Prowling the touchline clad all in black with his hair slicked back, Simeone has cultivated a kind of gangster look as he successfully unsettles Real Madrid and Barcelona, the football establishment in Spain. The combative Argentine refused to accept publicly that Atletico, with far inferior resources, would be able to compete with the big two but with huge effort and a never say die attitude he proved he was up for the challenge. Diego Simeone is thrown into the air by his players as they celebrate winning La Liga in May . Simeone has unsettled the dominance of Barcelona and Real Madrid in La Liga in Spain . Atletico were the most consistent of the three teams fighting for the La Liga title last season, basing their play on a rock-solid defence and wearing down their opponents. Diego Godin's header at Barcelona in May on the final day of the 2013-14 campaign, which earned Atletico the draw they needed to win their first La Liga crown in almost two decades, was yet another goal from a set play and typified the emphasis Simeone puts on strategy. After wrapping up the Spanish title, they came within a whisker of beating Real Madrid in the Champions League final, leading 1-0 until Sergio Ramos equalised with seconds remaining and eventually falling 4-1 after extra time. Atletico are currently third in La Liga and through to the last 16 of the Champions League, suggesting Simeone has been able to cope successfully with the exit of leading players like top scorer Diego Costa and defender Filipe Luis, both sold to Chelsea. Simeone is constantly looking ahead during matches, second-guessing the opposition and ready to switch tactics. Atletico's team includes many players who had never experienced success until the arrival of the man said to play with a knife between his teeth, who instilled his winning mentality and a 'match by match' philosophy. Simeone's success at the helm of Atletico Madrid has meant he is a favourite with the club's supporters . Atletico lost striker Diego Costa (left) and defender Felipe Luis  to Chelsea in the summer . He took over at the end of 2011 with the team struggling and made an immediate impact as they finished in fifth place before beating Athletic Bilbao to win the Europa League. Atletico showed by beating Chelsea in the European Super Cup that they were ready to challenge the continent's elite. In a further sign of what was to come, they won the 2013 King's Cup after stunning Real 2-1 in the final in Real's own Bernabeu arena. 'We are showing that with work you can compete,' Simeone said. 'There are a lot of fans of Madrid and Barcelona that congratulate me for what we are doing and that makes me proud,' added the 44-year-old. 'Fans of all the teams in Spain can identify and feel a small part of this Atletico Madrid.' Atletico made it to the Champions League final in 2014 but lost 4-1 to fierce rivals Real . Simeone showed the same fighting spirit as a player with Atletico, helping them win the domestic Spanish league and cup double in 1996. He was a fans favourite for his attitude which he puts down to his upbringing and battling through the youth system at his first club Velez Sarsfield. He was born in the Palermo district of Buenos Aires and began playing football on the street, but he did not have a disadvantaged childhood with his mother a hairdresser and his father a salesman. Simeone says it is from his parents that he learned to work hard and he was also influenced by the routine at Sarsfield. 'There they taught me values, wash your clothes, respect, order, everything that helps you in life. From order you start living better,' he told said.","Diego Simeone won the Spanish League with Atletico Madrid last season .

"Paris Saint-Germain's stuttering form continued as the defending champions were held to a goalless draw at home to Montpellier amid booing at the final whistle at the Parc des Princes. The result moves PSG level on points with league leaders Marseille who lead their rivals on goal difference and host Lille on Sunday, while Montpellier remain in ninth place in the standings. Both sides struggled to carve out chances while the only shot on target in an abject first half was Zlatan Ibrahimovic's weak free kick with Montpellier having a goal ruled out for a tight offside decision.

PSG manager Laurent Blanc watches on from the sidelines during his side's goalless draw in Paris . The champions increased the pressure after the break with Thiago Silva almost turning in a corner but Mounier cleared his effort off the line with Ligali beaten. Edinson Cavani was proving ineffective and was substituted in the 65th to a chorus of boos. PSG appealed for a penalty four minutes from time but their appeal was waved away by referee Sebastien Moreira. The result was also the first time since 2012 that PSG had failed to score in two successive matches.

"Protests outside the Australian embassy in Phnom Penh have turned violent, after news of an agreement to allow Australian refugees to be sent to Cambodia. The plan, which will see refugees sent from the Australian detention centre on Nauru, was signed today by Immigration Minister Scott Morrison and Cambodia's Minister of Interior Sar Kheng. Hundreds gathered to demand Australia renounces the agreement. One protester was knocked over by riot police and escorted from the rally bleeding from the head. Scroll down for video .

The plan will see no limits placed on how many refugees will be directed to Cambodia, however they would only be sent if they came to Australia by choice. The details of the arrangement are otherwise shrouded in secrecy. ABC has reported that the arrangement could begin as early as late this year. This morning, Mr Morrison revealed the resettlement costs would be paid for by the Australian government. 'The Australian Government will be providing over four years, and $40 million to support various overseas development aid projects,' he said. 'That's on top of the $79 million - or thereabouts - we currently provide in aid to Cambodia.' The agreement has been widely criticised, largely due to Cambodia being a poverty-stricken nation. The Australian Council for International Development (ACFID)-the peak body for overseas aid, humanitarian and development NGOs-has branded the Australian Government's deal with Cambodia cruel and unnecessary. The companies executive director Marc Purcell, said 'Refugees being sent to Cambodia are being set up to fail in a poor country. 'The deal places vulnerable people in a country ill-equipped to deal with their needs and it misuses aid, while ignoring other options. 'Cambodia should not be a country of resettlement. It has a total of 68 refugees and 12 asylum seekers currently, so receiving 1,000 refugees from Nauru would increase Cambodia's current refugee caseload by 1570%,' he said. Protesters are blocked by police. The agreement has been widely criticised, largely due to Cambodia being a poverty-stricken nation .

"Martin Skrtel  has warned Liverpool’s top-four rivals they should be ready to fight as they look to take momentum from his ‘most important’ goal. The Slovakian defender had eight staples put into a head wound following a clash with Olivier Giroud but carried on with a bandage to score the equaliser deep into injury time in Sunday’s dramatic 2-2 draw with Arsenal at Anfield. Liverpool have a chance to push on over Christmas with a fixture away to Burnley followed by home games against Swansea and Leicester. Martin Skrtel's last-gasp goal earned Liverpool a deserved point against Arsenal on Sunday . Skrtel feels the full force of Olivier Giroud's boot early in the second half at Anfield . Skrtel was in obvious pain as the blood poured from his head, but the Slovakian still played on . Skrtel was treated on the pitch for six minutes after being caught by Giroud's boot . The4 Slovakian posted this picture on Instagram on Sunday night of his head wound with eight staples . Skrtel knows they have to start showing consistency to fulfil their Champions League ambitions. Using Arsenal as the barometer for fourth place, though, Skrtel insists Liverpool should not feel daunted, as he maintains there was enough evidence on show on Sunday to prove that Brendan Rodgers’ side have the better prospects for the second half of the campaign. ‘We showed a great performance, we moved the ball well and scored two goals but unfortunately we conceded two as well,’ said Skrtel. ‘It was not an easy game, it was tough as it always is against Arsenal, but if we carry on in this way it can be good for us. In the last three games against Manchester United, Bournemouth and Arsenal we have shown great performances and we need to keep going this way. ‘We showed spirit, fight and desire. It is a good point but we wanted more. To get a point was reward for fighting to the end. Skrtel leaps above the Arsenal backline to power home a late leveller with his head and claim a point . The Liverpool defender celebrates his last-minute goal as the crowd go wild at Anfield . ‘The goal and the performance can help turn things around because there has been a lot of criticism of us and I hope it will change and be better in the second half of the season.’ Of his injury, Skrtel added: ‘It was sore afterwards but I was glad I could carry on and be there to the end. I had eight staples. Staples again! I spoke to the doctor on the pitch and he said it would be all right to carry on and I am glad I stayed there.’ Skrtel, who has 18 months left on his contract, is one of 13 defensive players with doubts over their long-term futures at the club.","Martin Skrtel scored late equaliser in 2-2 draw with Arsenal on Sunday .

"As England basked in the match-winning batting of Joe Root and James Taylor in Pallekele, it was easy to forget that the platform for their run-chase had been laid the day before by Chris Woakes. His spell of five for 19 in 2.5 overs at the end of the Sri Lankan innings on Wednesday had limited the hosts to 239 – a target England knocked off with five balls to spare to close the gap in this seven-match series to 3-2. On Saturday they have the chance to draw level. Woakes finished with six for 48, and now possesses two of the three six-wicket hauls in England’s one-day history. But his contribution goes beyond the record books: as much as anything, he embodies the spirit of a team that, against the odds, is beginning to believe in itself. Chris Woakes poses for a portrait after his superb bowling display for England in the fifth ODI . The Warwickshire seamer acknowledges taking his fifth wicket on Wednesday . England's six-wicket hauls in ODIs: . Woakes 6-45 vs Australia 2011 . Woakes 6-47 vs Sri Lanka 2014 . Collingwood 6-31 vs Bangladesh 2005 . England’s one-day side still has its problems, of course, and defeat on Saturday would add yet another series loss to the ledger. But there are reasons for optimism too. Moeen Ali has confirmed his explosive potential as an opener, Taylor has slotted in expertly at No 3, and Root has now made three match-winning hundreds this year alone. Jos Buttler finished off the run-chase in Hambantota, while James Tredwell has confirmed himself as the team’s spin-bowling banker. Chris Jordan’s control has improved as the series has gone on. The form of Woakes, though, is as promising as anything. His 12 scalps at 19 apiece make him the leading wicket-taker in the series on either side, three clear of Sri Lankan spinner Ajantha Mendis. The next-best seamer is Jordan, on just six. Steven Finn’s Woakes’s new-ball partner, has collected only three. Woakes bowls Ajantha Mendis in Pallekele to end the Sri Lankan innings on 239, setting up the England win . Woakes jumps for joy after getting Mahela Jayawardene in the fifth ODI . With James Anderson and Stuart Broad set to return from injury in time for the World Cup, and Finn still capable of improvement, England are building a useful stock of seamers ahead of the tournament in Australia and New Zealand – so much so that someone may have to miss out. ‘It’s always at the back of your mind,’ said Woakes. ‘With Jimmy and Broady not being here it has given some of the guys, particularly myself, the opportunity to put our hand up and show the management and coaches what we can do. ‘It’s been good for me, because I have been bowling in some tough conditions. It has been good experience, good exposure and the more you play at international level the better you get.’ Back at The Oval in August 2013, Woakes was winning his first Test cap against Australia. If Shane Watson and Steve Smith made him look a touch pedestrian, he has since added a yard of pace. It is a process he attributes to three coaches: Graeme Welch at Warwickshire, Kevin Shine at the ECB Academy in Loughborough, and England’s own David Saker, whom Woakes credits with sorting out a ‘slight technical issue’ with his front arm. As if to underline the point, Woakes played in the three Tests England won against India in the summer. And if his figures were unremarkable – five wickets at 43 – then his endeavour deserved better. Woakes said: ‘I feel it was maybe a bit of a turning point. It has been nice to be on this tour and get a run of games and show people what I can do.’ More heroics on Saturday and those people may need convincing no longer.","Chris Woakes is leading wicket taker in series with 12 at average on 19 .

"Former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff will be available to play for the Brisbane Heat in the entirety of the upcoming KFC T20 Big Bash League. The 37-year-old was scheduled to play in the back half of the competition as a replacement for fellow overseas player Daniel Vettori, who is set to link up with New Zealand for their World Cup preparations. But an injury to spinner Samuel Badree means Flintoff will assume the West Indian's place in the squad. Andrew Flintoff poses during the Brisbane Heat Big Bash League season launch on Tuesday .

"Staff at Saks Fifth Avenue's flagship store in Manhattan ran an identity theft scam using stolen shoppers' information that netted more than $400,000 worth of designer shoes, handbags and accessories, authorities said. The sophisticated scheme funneled stolen data to corrupt salespeople to create sham transactions, complete with phony shoppers on the other side of the register, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. and federal authorities said on Monday. The haul included a roughly $10,000 Yves St. Laurent handbag, $2,000-a-pair shoes and brand names such as Louis Vuitton, Christian Louboutin and Kate Spade, he said. More than $400,000 worth of designer shoes, handbags and accessories was fraudulently bought from Saks Fifth Avenue's flagship store in Manhattan (pictured) using stolen shoppers' information, it's been alleged . At least eight people, including four Saks employees, were part of the identity theft ring, officials said, and have been charged with various offenses. 'Time after time again, we see that insiders at companies enable theft to occur,' said Vance, whose office has prosecuted crimes it said were abetted by employees in settings ranging from pricey steakhouses to parking garages. The latest case targeted the high-end store with a shoe department so well-known that it has its own special ZIP code: 10022-SHOE. Vance said the ringleader was Tamara Williams, who he said obtained Social Security numbers, birth dates and other personal data for more than 20 Saks credit card holders. Williams supplied the information to her accomplices on the sales floors, who used it to look up the shoppers' Saks account numbers or otherwise complete needed details to ring up more than 90 fraudulent sales in six months, prosecutors said. The sophisticated scheme funneled stolen data to corrupt salespeople to create sham transactions, complete with phony shoppers on the other side of the register, Manhattan prosecutors said . To make the transactions look legitimate, other accomplices would collect the merchandise, posing as the shoppers or functionaries sent on their behalf, prosecutors said. Some items were sold on the black market, others were returned in exchange for Saks gift cards and then sold or used to pay the phony shoppers and still others apparently became part of Williams' wardrobe, Vance said. Investigators found hundreds of boxes of merchandise in her Queens home, he said. Williams' lawyer, Barry Turner, declined to comment after she and the four salespeople pleaded not guilty Monday to grand larceny, identity theft and other charges. Three people accused of being phony shoppers also have been charged. Prosecutors credit Saks with initiating the investigation. A representative for Saks, part of Toronto-based Hudson's Bay Co., didn't immediately respond to an inquiry about the case and the accused employees' status.","Staff at Saks Fifth Avenue's flagship store were allegedly running a huge identity theft ring .

"Burger King is accused of bullying a veteran who bit into a needle-laced burger and sued after he was hospitalized. Clarke Bartholomew, 46, says he was stationed in Hawaii in 2010 when he bit into a Triple Stacker laced with needles that pierced his tongue and got stuck in his intestine. Now an attorney for the Miami-based fast food company wants the case thrown out and lawyer fees paid because Bartholomew did not attend a September 10 meeting in Honolulu to discuss settlement terms. Service: Clarke Bartholomew is at odds with Burger King over a lawsuit for a burger laced with needles . Bartholomew said in a court filing this week he could not attend the meeting because he recently began a new job in Virginia, where he lives after his medical retirement from the Army. 'Since I was a new employee, I had no time on the books to take time off to fly from Virginia to Hawaii, for the settlement conference,' said Bartholomew, now a U.S. Parks Police dispatcher. His lawyers have shot back that Burger King is 'bullying a represented opponent for not appearing at a settlement conference.' Attorneys for Bartholomew said in court filings that Burger King violated orders to discuss the settlement and provide written offers before the meeting. Bartholomew has faced resistance from both Burger King and the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, the franchise operator. Grant Kidani, representing Burger King in Honolulu, said the branch is 'totally operated by the government.' Government lawyers claimed that Bartholomew could not sue because he incurred the injuries during military service. 'Eating a Burger King Triple Whopper (equally available to the military or general public) while at home on a sick day does not implicate military command or discipline,' wrote U.S. District Judge J. Michael Seabright on allowing the case to continue.","Clarke Bartholomew, 46, was stationed in Hawaii in 2010 when he bit into a Triple Stacker with needles inside that lodged in his tongue and intestine .

"Excavations of an ancient synagogue found in a city where Mary Magdalene is thought to have lived have thrown up clues about how the Jewish and Christian religions developed. Jewish artefacts found at the site in Migdal on the shore of the Sea of Galilee - previously known as Magdala - include a table carved with a Menorah, yet the temple itself, as well as a coin, discovered on the site dates back to the time of Jesus and the rise of Christianity in the region. Archaeologists believe this combination suggests Jews and Christians may have once used the holy site to worship together, according to Israeli news site Haaretz, and it could lead to discoveries about how and when Jesus and Magdalene met. Excavations of an ancient synagogue in the town of Migdal in Israel, pictured, have thrown up clues about how the Jewish and Christian religions developed. Jewish artefacts have been found at the site on the shore of the Sea of Galilee - previously known as Magdala - yet the temple itself dates back to the time of Jesus . The synagogue ruins, pictured, were first uncovered in 2009 and they are thought to date back around 2,000 years. The mixture of Jewish artefacts and a coin found from 29AD - a year before Jesus is said to have arrived in the area - suggests Jews and Judeo-Christians may have once used the holy site to worship together . Migdal is the modern-day name for the village of Magdala,  situated on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee at the foot of Mount Arbel. Magdala is said to have been the hometown of Mary Magdalene, one of . Jesus' most loyal followers. She is referred to in the gospels as Mary, and it is believed that her name was a variation of 'Mary from Magdala'. Researchers are studying the site looking for clues about how and when Magdalene first met and began following Jesus. The synagogue was first uncovered in 2009 dating back to the 1st Century - around 2,000 years ago. It measures 11 x 11 metres, and the walls of the room plus the six columns that supported the ceiling, which was probably made of wooden beams and mortar, would have been covered with frescoes painted in seven colours including dark red, yellow and blue panels in black and white frames. The excavation revealed the synagogue was renovated in around 40 of 50 C.E, before being abandoned shortly before 68 C.E. This year is significant because it was the time of the Great Revolt of the Jews against the Romans. Archaeologists have also uncovered  various Jewish artefacts, which Haaretz describes as 'firsts in archaeological excavations, in Israel and even worldwide.' However, a coin found on the site dated back to 29 A.D - a year before Jesus is said to have arrived in the area and four years before his crucifixion - making it potentially a location of interest for Christianity as well. Migdal is the modern-day name for the village of Magdala,  situated on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee at the foot of Mount Arbel. Magdala is said to have been the hometown of Mary Magdalene. One the Jewish artefacts recovered from Magdala excavations includes this table, carved with a seven-branched candelabrum, pictured . An artist's impression of Mary Magdalene at St. Nicholas's Cathedral in Monaco . Magdalene is described as one of Jesus' most loyal followers and it is also thought she was one of the first people to speak to him after his resurrection. She is referred to in the gospels as Mary, and it is believed that her name was a variation of 'Mary from Magdala'. However, there is no direct connection with Mary and the town of Magdala in the bible. Researchers are studying the site looking for clues about how and when Magdalene first met and began following Jesus. Father Juan Maria Solana, director of the Magdala Center told Public Radio International: From the Jewish point of view, the . position is clear; it’s a first-century synagogue. The dig is being carried out by archaeologist Dina Avshalom-Gorni and Arfan Najar with Marcela Zapata. They are hoping to find clues as to how and when Jesus came to the town and met Magdalene.

"Two great white sharks were caught on video lurking in the waters off the coast of a resort town in Cape Cod. Scott Koerner, who works at the Marine Biological Laboratory, was on the water in Chatham Saturday when the dorsal fins of two sharks appeared. As Koerner films, the sharks thrash their tails in the shallow water before slipping back beneath the surface of the water. Scroll down for video . Lurking: Two great whites were caught on video swimming in the shallow waters off the coast of Cape Cod on Sunday . Though their numbers were once on the decline in New England, great whites are no longer as exotic as they once were. Earlier this year, scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration published a study in PLOS ONE saying that the great white population had rebounded from low numbers. The recovery could be seen beginning in 2000, spurred by conservation laws like a 1997 ban on the fishing of the shark, which can grow up to 5,000 pounds. The sharks were also helped by a growing abundance of prey, and one of the sharks' favored meals, the grey seal, makes its home off the coast of Cape Cod. Great whites tend to be elusive, but there have been times the shark has come too close for comfort to humans. According to National Geographic, of the 100 or more shark attacks every year, between a third and a half can be blamed on great whites. Predator: The great white shark can grow to weigh 5,000 pounds and recent efforts to protect the species have seen the shark returning to waters of Cape Cod . Boston Magazine reports that a great white upended two kayakers in Cape Cod in September, taking a bite out of one of the boats but leaving the paddlers unharmed.

According to Reuters, the chief executive of Foundation Medicine, Michael Pellini referred to the deal during a corporate earnings call on Wednesday. Google's employees were made aware of the new benefit being included in their health portfolio last week, however the company has made no public comment. This latest health benefit is part of the 'loyalty war' in operation in Silicon Valley as the various technology giants battle to retain their best staff with more imaginative inducements. In recent weeks, Apple and Facebook said that they would begin covering the cost of egg freezing for female employees. In Silicon Valley, where software developers are in short supply, companies are competing to offer new health benefits as a key means to recruit and retain talent.

"FIFA has announced that two options have emerged as the most likely dates for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar - and both are in the winter. A meeting of a task force to look into the international calendar has identified January/February 2022 or November/December 2022 as the most likely options - meaning considerable disruption to the normal football season. FIFA has been asked to consider May 2022 by the clubs however, despite concerns over the blistering heat during that month. Scroll down for video . The 2022 Qatar World Cup could be held in January/February or November/December. Pictured Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani (left) holds the World Cup trophy next to FIFA president Joseph Blatter . FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke said in a statement on Monday: 'We are getting closer to narrowing the dates for the FIFA World Cup to two options - January/February 2022 or November/December 2022 - but FIFA has also been asked to consider May 2022. 'We will summarise what we've heard today and provide feedback to all parties in order for them to prepare for the next meeting as we progress towards a final decision.' FIFA added that Qatar 2022 chief executive Hassan Al Thawadi had stated that the 'ideal situation' for the Middle East 'for an all-inclusive World Cup would be for it to be held in the winter' although it was still open to the traditional June/July dates. Meanwhile, FIFA is facing the prospect of losing two of its biggest sponsors after airline Emirates decided not to renew its contract and electronics giant Sony also considering ending its links with the world governing body. An artist's impression, supplied by Qatar 2022, of the dazzling Doha Port stadium which is one of 10 stadiums being builtfor the tournament, which has been dogged by controversy . The confirmation comes four months after a number of FIFA's official World Cup partners expressed concerns about the negative publicity surrounding the latest allegations of corruption. Emirates' contract expires next month and the Dubai-based airline has confirmed it will not renew its sponsorship. FIFA said it has known of the decision since 2012. It is understood Qatar Airways - owned by 2022 World Cup hosts Qatar - is considering becoming a sponsor in its place. FIFA confirmed that Emirates will not be renewing its deal and that talks are ongoing with Sony. Samsung, which is a major Olympic sponsor, may take over from Sony. Both Emirates and Sony are among FIFA's official partners - the six top tier sponsors who provided hundreds of millions of pounds in sponsorship income to the world governing body. FIFA said in a statement to the Press Association: 'Emirates had already informed FIFA back in June 2012 about the restructuring of its sponsorship concept and FIFA respects this. 'Due to the ongoing negotiations, we cannot give any further information about future partners in this category at this stage. 'The current contract with Sony still runs until 31 December 2014 and we are currently in on-going discussions with Sony.' Chuck Blazer agreed to take a secret microphone into meetings with football officials for the FBI . Emirates also confirmed its plans, saying in a statement: 'Emirates can confirm that a decision has been made not to renew the sponsorship agreement with FIFA past 2014. This decision was made following an evaluation of FIFA's contract proposal which did not meet Emirates' expectations.' In June, a number of partners including Sony made public their concerns about the effect of continuing negative publicity around FIFA. It followed publication of fresh allegations of corruption surrounding World Cup voting and elections for FIFA positions. Adidas, the sportswear firm which is perhaps FIFA's most important partner and has a deal until 2030, said at the time: 'The negative tenor of the public debate around FIFA at the moment is neither good for football nor for FIFA and its partners.' Japanese electronics giant Sony said in June the corruption claims should 'be investigated appropriately' and called for FIFA to observe 'its principles of integrity, ethics and fair play'. FIFA earned more than £230 million from sponsors and other marketing partners last year. Meanwhile, a Conservative MP has called for the Serious Fraud Office to investigate World Cup bidding after claims that the FBI persuaded a FIFA executive to bug his meetings during the London 2012 Olympics. Damian Collins says reports that Chuck Blazer agreed to take a tiny, secret microphone into meetings with other football officials should persuade the SFO to investigate. The New York Daily News reported that Blazer, the American former FIFA executive committee member, agreed to take a bug hidden inside a key ring into meetings, some of which took place in London. He was under investigation by the FBI and tax authorities for millions in unpaid taxes, the newspaper said. The SFO said last week it does not have the jurisdiction to investigate World Cup bidding but Collins believes the latest reports on the FBI should make it reconsider. Collins told Press Association Sport: 'If the FBI investigation includes meetings that Chuck Blazer held in London during the Olympics, then that should come under the jurisdiction of the SFO.' US attorney Michael Garcia has finished his investigation into bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, won by Russia and Qatar respectively. England also bid for the 2018 tournament but was eliminated in the first round of voting. Garcia's report is now being studied by the head of FIFA's ethics adjudicatory chamber, German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, but he has said he will not publish it in full. Collins wants the SFO to demand FIFA send it a copy of the Garcia report.","The dates would mean considerable disruption to domestic leagues .

"The former Navy SEAL who wrote an inside account of the mission that killed Osama bin Laden says the years since have been harder than any of his 13 deployments. Matthew Bissonnette released his controversial book No Easy Day in 2012 and immediately faced the ire of the Pentagon and fellow SEALs. Things have been so bad for Bissonnette, AKA Mark Owen, that he told CBS that he'd rather personally take on the Islamic State. 'I would go back overseas today and deal with fighting ISIS face-to-face rather than deal with the last two years again,' he said Sunday. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: A disguised Matthew Bissonnette AKA Mark Owen was back on 60 Minutes Sunday to defend himself against accusations he put fellow soldiers in danger when he published a book about the day he helped take down Osama bin Laden . Bissonnette's surprising statement came as he continued to defend himself against claims he somehow knowingly endangered his fellow SEALs, and even America's safety as a whole, by divulging classified information. 'That's absolutely not what I intended to do. These are my brothers that I served beside for years,' he said. Bissonnette told CBS he believed at the time of his book's publication that he was acting totally within the law. However, now Bissonnette says he was following the advice of his attorney at the time when he chose to forego submitting his manuscript to the Pentagon before it went to print. It's clear now that was a mistake. Even Bissonnette's former commander has washed his hands of the problem. 'I [wanted] to reach out to my former command and say, ""Hey, look, sir, let's discuss. I have nothing to hide,""' he said. 'I got a text message back just simply saying, you know, ""Delete me.""' With so much venom flying his way, the former soldier says he's had to change his habits in hopes of calling as little attention to himself as possible. 'I fly a little further underneath the radar than I ever have before. I don't want anybody to know where I live,' he said. 'I want to be very cautious - security wise.' Now, as he prepares to publish a sequel to his dangerous tome, his lawyer has revealed a vast proportion of the profits could be soaked up by extensive fines leveled by the Pentagon. Last time he was on 60 Minutes, Bissonnette gave a step-by-step walkthrough of how SEAL Team Six tok down the elusive terrorist . The latest probe centers on the speeches Bissonnette has made since publishing his tell-all book under the pseudonym Mark Owen, The New York Times revealed. It comes after Bissonnette submitted a draft of his second book - No Hero: The Evolution Of A Navy SEAL - for approval from the Department of Defense, including slides and notes from his speeches. He has already apologized for failing to seek approval for his revelations in No Easy Day, and allegedly agreed to forfeit a portion of his royalties in a dispute settlement. However, another probe has been launched to investigate details disclosed at speeches across the U.S. Last year, he spoke at a golf club in Atlanta where visitors were instructed to deposit their phones at the door and were barred from taking notes. Deployed 13 times: Bissonnette was part of the same team that rescue Captain Phillips from Somali pirates . Presidents Bush: Bissonnette became something of a celebrity, though he never intended to reveal his identity -- it was revealed for him. Here he's seen with both Presidents Bush . Bissonnette, right, says even his former commander has washed his hands of him in the wake of his book controversey . His lawyer Robert D Luskin insists the speeches were not controversial and says he  expects the investigation to be resolved 'favorably'. Bissonnette was disciplined in November 2012 for sharing classified information with the makers of the popular video game Medal of Honor: Warfighter. According to senior Navy officials, Bissonnette recruited his fellow SEALs to spend two days as paid consultants for Electronic Arts. It was the investigation the military launched into Bissonnette's book  that led the authorities to discover that he had allegedly 'recruited' the 11 Navy SEALS into the video game deal. His second piece of work is a reaction to the Oscar-nominated film Zero Dark Thirty, which consulted former CIA director Leon E Panetta. The narrative conflicted with many elements of Bissonnette's telling, and in his opinion it is the SEALs' story to tell. The news comes as  the SEAL Team 6 member called 'The Shooter' - who fired the kill shot at Bin Laden - prepares to reveal his identity. Controversial: He was forced to apologize after publishing No Easy Day without Pentagon approval. The book, written under the pseudonym Mark Owen, was an inside account of the mission that killed Osama bin Laden . He fiercely guarded in the aftermath of the May 2011 raid on Bin Laden's Abbottabad, Pakisatan compound, fearing the SEAL could be targeted by al-Qaeda as retribution. But he has since retired and is apparently ready to take off his mask of anonymity to detail the events leading up to and during Operation Neptune's Spear. According to a Fox News press release, the two-part special The Man Who Killed Usama Bin Laden will air Tuesday November 11 and Wednesday November 12 from 10-11pm ET. The interview will be conducted by Washington Correspondent Peter Doocy. 'Revealing his identity and speaking out publicly for the first time, the Navy SEAL, also known as “The Shooter,” will share his story of training to be a member of America’s elite fighting force and explain his involvement in Operation Neptune Spear, the mission that killed Bin Laden,' the press release states. 'The documentary will provide an extensive, first-hand account of the mission, including the unexpected crash of one of the helicopters that night and why SEAL Team 6 feared for their lives. It will also touch upon what was taking place inside the terrorist compound while President Obama and his cabinet watched from the White House.' It's unclear whether the Shooter's identity will be protected in anyway, or if he will both appear on the camera and reveal his real name. Fears: Officials feared the account of the mission, which the White House watched live (pictured), could reveal key details of U.S. military strategy. Bissonnette was already disciplined for liaising with a video game on it .","Matthew Bissonnette published No Easy Day unapproved in 2012 and says the years that followed were hellish .

"An award-winning British athlete may never run again after he was paralysed when he jumped into a reservoir for a swimming workout and broke his neck. Drew Graham, a 1500m runner, broke his neck when he dived into Cherry Creek Reservoir, in Aurora, Colorado. His wife Laura jumped into the creek to save her husband but despite her best efforts, 29-year-old Mr Graham, from Gosforth, Newcastle Upon Tyne, had broken a vertebra. He underwent six hours of surgery but it is not known whether Mr Graham, who took a scholarship at Adams State University in Colorado in 2008, will be able to run again. Scroll down for video .

After diving into the water, Mr Graham (pictured with his wife Laura) lost all feeling below his shoulders . His friends have now issued a £15,000 fundraising plea to help with medical costs - with generous donations already raising more than £11,000. His parents Gary and Carol, both 56, and his brother Jonathan and sister Helena, who also ran competitively, travelled to the US when they were told the news. Gary Graham, who is self-employed, said: 'We got the phone call last Saturday night. It's just one of those devastating phone calls every parent never wants to get. 'It was made worse because of him living so far away and we didn't have all the details. It took us 48 hours to get here and all sorts were going through our minds. 'And then to walk into the hospital to see your son fighting for his life was just tragic. 'He's a strong guy and physically fit and he's been an athlete since he was 10-years-old and that's going to help him. He's determined and anyone who ran against him will know that.' After diving into the Cherry Creek Reservoir on September 21, Mr Graham lost all feeling and mobility below his shoulders and was transported to the Aurora Medical Centre before being transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.

He took a scholarship at the university in 2008 and went on to win 15 All-American cross country and athletics titles . Because of work commitments, Mrs Graham, 31, a professional research assistant, doesn't live with him in Texas and he was visiting her at the time of the accident. When he injured himself, her quick-thinking efforts meant that her husband never lost consciousness and increased the chances of his recovery. Mr Graham, now a cross country coach at Abilene Christian University in Abilene, in Texas, has regained movement in his arms and began breathing on his own less than 48 hours after surgery. Mr Graham pictured at his hospital bed at Aurora Medical Centre, in Denver, Colorado . It is hoped he will be transferred to a rehabilitation centre and it is not known how much of the cost will be covered by his insurance. His father added: 'We are parents and we will do anything to help with the fundraising. We take the NHS for granted but Drew's life is in America. 'People in America started the fundraising and it's snowballed from there. Our friends and family in the UK have also been brilliant.' Colin Haggie, President of Gosforth Harriers and Athletic Club where Drew used to train, said: 'It's quite devastating really. He wasn't being daft, he just dived into some water.' As a Gosforth Harrier, he came through the ranks and by his late teens had firmly established himself as one of the region's leading middle distance stars. In 2007 he won the Northern 800m title and became North East Champion in both the 800m and 1500m. He then took a scholarship at Adams State University in Colarado in 2008, where he won 15 all-American titles across cross country and athletics. In 2012 he was named the United States Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches' Association Indoor Track Male Athlete of the Year. He was also named the Men's Central Region Track Athlete of the Year, by the US Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association.","Acclaimed British middle distance runner paralysed in swimming accident .

"Robert Eunson nearly died when his spleen ballooned to the size of a bowling ball, weighing 5.5kg - 30 times its usual size . A pensioner nearly died when his spleen ballooned to 12lb (5.5kg) - more than 30 times its usual size and began crushing his vital organs. The organ had grown to the size of a bowling ball by the time doctors removed it. Three surgeons worked to save the life of Robert Eunson during a seven-hour operation at Furness General Hospital in Cumbria. They said the spleen was the biggest they had removed in more than 15 years, and are preparing to write a medical paper on Mr Eunson's case. In a healthy adult, the spleen is around 7cm to 14cm in length and usually weighs between 150g and 200g - around the size of a large apple. Mr Eunson's wife Catherine, 73, said she watched as her husband was 'dying in front of her eyes'. His infected spleen had begun to crush his liver, lungs, stomach and pancreas. The spleen, which is located just under the heart, helps fight infections acting as a blood filter removing old red blood cells and storing a reservoir of blood. Mrs Eunson said the organ had invaded her husband's 'whole body', was warned the 72-year-old would die if it was not removed. Mr Eunson, of Walney, Cumbria, said he is unable to thank staff at the hospital enough. 'They told me if it didn't come out I would die - but they said if I had it done I only had a 40 per cent chance of survival. 'I was in intense, constant pain down my left side. 'If it wasn't for them I wouldn't be alive now. I feel brilliant and I can't thank them enough.' In September, Mr Eunson's spleen became infected, filling with even more blood and causing the organ to stretch across the back of his lungs. He was in intensive care for days and developed pneumonia before his operation. He had to undergo seven blood transfusions within a week. Mrs Eunson, his wife of 50 years, said: 'The spleen got bigger and bigger. It was crushing his liver, lungs, stomach and pancreas. It was pushing against his ribs. 'He couldn't do anything for himself. He was just lying in a bed. It was terrible. He was literally dying in front of my eyes.' His wife Catherine, pictured with the 72-year-old, said her husband was 'dying in front of my eyes' as his massive spleen began to invade his body, crushing his vital organs . Mrs Eunson said she could not believe her husband was alive after the seven-hour operation. She said: 'I just couldn't believe it. I was scared. I honestly didn't think he was going to make it.' A team of three surgeons and as many as a dozen nurses were involved in the operation. Mrs Eunson added: 'The hospital showed me and my daughter an X-ray of his spleen from two years ago and one from when it was infected. 'We just couldn't believe the size of it. It just took up his whole body.' Mr Eunson is due to return to the hospital for a CT scan and a check-up. Mr Sanjay Panchal, consultant in General Surgery at Furness General Hospital, carried out the operation. He said: 'It was a huge spleen, the largest I have ever removed and it took us about three to three-and-a -half-hours to do the procedure. 'It is not a common operation, I have done say about 30 in my career. 'Normally the spleen weighs between 150 to 250g. Anything over 1kg is classed as a massive spleen. 'It is unusual for the spleen to be that enlarged and in this case it weighed over 5kg.' The world’s heaviest spleen removed weighed 6kg (14.5lbs) from a man in the US, according to official records. The spleen is located underneath the heart . The spleen stores blood in the body in case of emergency. Mr Eunson's 5.5kg organ weighed about the same as an average bowling ball. A normal spleen weighs between 150 and 200g - the same as an apple. It is located on the left side of the upper abdomen behind the rib cage and acts as a filter for your blood, cleansing it of bacteria, viruses and other debris. When blood flows through your spleen, white blood cells attack and remove any foreign invaders. This keeps your blood clean and helps protect against infection. Red blood cells have a lifespan of around 120 days, after which your spleen breaks them down. The red blood cell remains are transported elsewhere in your body where they are excreted or recycled. Foetuses produce red and white blood cells in their spleens. Shortly before birth the spleen loses its ability to make red blood cells and bone marrow takes over. It is possible to live without a spleen as most of its functions can be taken over by other organs. However, people without spleens are more vulnerable to infection.","Robert Eunson's spleen became infected in September, filling with blood .

"Former Cabinet Secretary Lord O'Donnell will head the 'What Works Centre for Wellbeing' The Government has announced the creation of an organisation that will assess how policy impacts the nation's happiness. The 'What Works Centre for Wellbeing' is the latest addition to the 'What Works Network', which was launched by the Government last year to improve public services through 'evidence-based policy and practice'. The new centre will soon be commissioning universities to research the impact that different services have on the British public's wellbeing. Professor Kevin Fenton, Executive Director of Health and Wellbeing at Public Health England, called the centre, the 'first of its kind in the world'. He added: 'The shift to wellbeing is a key aspect of public health and there are clear benefits to this approach. 'We are keen to see the evidence of what works for wellbeing much more effectively disseminated and adopted across the country. 'We are confident that this work will lead to better outcomes for health in communities, workplaces and more widely. 'PHE recently launched its key priorities for improving and protecting the public's health. 'Making a shift towards wellbeing and focusing on what helps keep people and communities well is one of the key drivers and opportunities we see going forward.' The 'What Works Centre for Wellbeing' has initial funding of more than £3.5 million over three years, with the support of Government departments, arts foundations and charities. Last year Lord O'Donnell said that putting people's health and wellbeing at the heart of policy making was 'the next stage of public sector reform', adding: 'This is about better Government, not bigger Government.'

Georgina Bartter, 19, was at Harbourlife festival at Mrs Macquarie's Chair near the Sydney Botanical Gardens on Saturday when she collapsed on the dancefloor. A close friend of Ms Bartter, who spent most of the day before and during the festival with her told Daily Mail Australia they first noticed something was wrong when she started shivering uncontrollably at around 4pm. Scroll down for video . Georgina Bartter, 19, died of a suspected drug overdose at Harbourlife festival in Sydney on Saturday . 'She seemed fine for a while and then she started shivering as if she was getting cold', the friend revealed. 'She started going downhill from there.' Despite friends giving her water and trying to warm her up, Ms Bartter continued to deteriorate. 'I was with her for a while, just me and her, and I was there trying to give her a hug and keep her warm', the friend said. As she got worse another friend and his girlfriend were caring for the teenager from Longueville in Sydney's lower north shore before she started convulsing around 4.40pm. The same pair then travelled in an ambulance to hospital with Ms Bartter, where she died later that night. 'It's been pretty tough for all of us,' the friend said, describing Ms Bartter as a 'bubbly' and 'friendly' girl. The family of the teenager - whose friends said she only took 'one and a half' pills - released a statement on Sunday remembering her as a 'beautiful young woman'. Friends said the teenager had taken one and a half pills before she collapsed . Family have released a statement about the teenager's death, pictured here with her mother and grandmother . The head of St Vincent's Hospital's Emergency department, Dr Gordion Fulde told Triple M that everything was done to save the economics student, who was in a critical condition when she arrived at the hospital. 'It was quickly evident the only chance of survival was to put her on a heart lung machine. This equipment mechanically gives her blood flow and oxygen,' said Dr Fulde. 'The cardiothoracic surgeon and operation theatre staff and the hi-tech machine were brought.' 'Despite care only available in a few hospitals worldwide a lovely girl died.' Dr Fulde says the team at St Vincent's Hospital remain devastated after witnessing the family's intense grief. 'The grief and devastation of the family, of the mother was indescribable.' The statement also remembered her as 'vibrant' and said the teenager's behaviour was out of character, Nine News reported. 'She was a beautiful and vibrant young woman, who was much loved and will be sadly missed, the statement read. 'She had allergies, and it was extremely out of character.' The family reportedly said, 'Georgina was allergic to drugs and never would have knowingly taken them', according to Channel Seven. An autopsy will be carried out to determine what was in the pill that contributed to her death. Officers were alerted to the unconscious 19-year-old woman as they carried out a drug operation at the event. The teen from Longueville on Sydney's north shore was taken to St Vincent's Hospital, suffered multiple organ failure and died. Witnesses recall seeing Ms Bartter 'collapse' in the middle of the dance floor and begin frothing at the mouth. Witnesses recall seeing the young woman collapse, dropping to the ground in the middle of the dancefloor where she shook uncontrollably . 'She was dancing next to us when she collapsed on the dance floor. I thought she was pretty hammered but then she just dropped to the floor,' one witness told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was shocking, you just don’t know what to do. We were all waving our arms around for a paramedic.' The three witnesses were distressed to learn that the young woman had died, but say that night they knew something was drastically wrong. 'Medics were trying to resuscitate her and she was frothing at the mouth,' the witnesses, who wished not to be named, explained. 'When she got carried out she wasn't well. Her eyes were in the back of her head and her friends were freaking out.' Two of the witnesses explain that it was 'wild' and claim they saw four people taken to hospital due to what they assume were drug-related incidents. 'She was the worst but we saw three other people taken out by ambulances.' 'I actually wondered this morning if anyone had died cos I saw that many people overdose and in a bit of a state. It was that wild.' NSW Ambulance service confirm that four people were treated from Mrs Macquarie's Chair. Two people were taken to hospital by ambulance, including Ms Bartter. The second case was an alleged assault. Two suspected drug-related cases were treated at the scene. Friends described Ms Bartter, seen here with her father, as a 'bubbly' and 'friendly' young girl . Ms Bartter, pictured with her mother and father died in hospital on Saturday night . Another witness recalls seeing the girl become ‘drowsy’ and ‘shaking’ before she collapsed. ‘Not long after she collapsed the medics were with her. She was shaking non-stop for a bit while on the ground. Very sad sight. Condolences to her family.’ Officers, meanwhile, arrested 78 people at the event for drug offences. Inspector Stewart Leggat of City Central Local Area Command asked for anyone with knowledge about synthetic substance sellers to come forward. 'The information you provide could save someone's life.' Insp Leggat warned about the dangers of taking illegal drugs, emphasising there was no quality control in their production. 'Quite simply, you don't know what you are getting - seeking a synthetic high, could result in a serious injury or death,' he said. 'If you know of a business or person who may be involved in the sale of illegal synthetic substances, please contact Crime Stoppers immediately. We don't need to know who you are, all we need is the information you have. Witnesses said they saw at least four people taken to hospital one the same day, from suspected drug-related incidents . 'The information you provide could save someone's life.' The organisers of Harbourlife, Fuzzy Events, have extended their sincere condolences to the young woman's loved ones and assure the public patron safety is a priority. 'Right now our thoughts are with her family – we can hardly imagine the pain and heartbreak they must be feeling, and they have our deepest sympathy,' the statement read. 'Harbourlife has been held annually since 2003. It has a fully equipped first aid tent with an emergency doctor, 2 paramedics, 3 first responder medics, 2 supervisors and a communications officer.' The 19-year-old was treated by paramedics at the scene and transported to St Vincents hospital, Darlinghurst where she died .","Georgina Bartter, 19, died from a suspected drug overdose at the weekend .

Bronk entered through the same door Goodell came through and casually strolled up to the podium where the commissioner was speaking about half-an- hour into the event. Wearing a cap and holding another cap in his hand, Bronk was immediately grabbed by a group of around eight security guards and league executives. As he was led away, he started to scream: 'What are you doing, what are you doing?' The comedian then added: 'Don't take me to the elevator', referring to video footage of the Baltimore Ravens running back punching his former fiance.

"Jonathan Parker was suspended after pupils' parents complained his comments were racist . A teacher has been suspended after being accused of racism over satirical Facebook posts about Ukip and Muslims. Jonathan Parker wrote a series of messages on the social network last May in which he 'blamed Muslims' for Sainsbury's running out of pork chops, and jokingly urged followers to 'Vote Ukip'. Parents of pupils at Washwood Heath Academy in Birmingham, investigated among other schools amid claims of the spread of Islamic extremism as part of the Trojan Horse scandal, considered the remarks racist and complained. Mr Parker was suspended as a result and is currently being investigated by staff at the school. Among his posts, the teacher said he was writing a book 'about students' which he would call 'Fifty Shades of c***'. In response to a friend who wrote: 'Muslims cause cancer,' the teacher replied: 'Muslims cause paedophilia,' and in a separate post he wrote: 'Sainsburys have run out of pork chops. I blame the Muslims. Vote UKIP.' 'Bloody tax dodging immigrants. If they paid their own way we'd have more money for health, education, public services and pensions. Right I'm off for a STARBUCKS. Vote UKIP,' was another, while a separate message read: 'Halal meat used in curry houses up and down the country! Hands off our national dish! Vote UKIP.' His comments were considered 'inflammatory' by a parent at the school which is still reeling from an Ofsted investigation into claims Islamic extremism was being promoted by teachers. Scroll down for video . 'Teachers should not be saying this kind of stuff even as a joke. It is racist. 'The language used at a time when tensions are high in the city is completely unprofessional. 'Teachers have a duty outside of work to uphold the professions standards and all this has done is fuel the fire within the community. 'They are highly inflammatory comments when you consider most of the pupils are Muslim at the school.' The teacher was accused of racism after posting a string of 'highly inflammatory' comments on Facebook (above) A 15-year-old pupil added: 'He's always been a popular teacher so we were very shocked when we saw these comments. 'A lot of the pupils are furious about what has happened and were upset and offended that a teacher we trust could say these things.' But a friend of Mr Parker said the posts were intended as jokes to poke fun at the Ukip during last May's European Elections. The man, who did not want to be named, said: 'The messages were to friends only and were satirical, made at the time of the European elections last May, directed against UKIP by sending up the anti-Islamic aspects of their campaign.' Washwood Heath Academy was among schools investigated as part of the Trojan Horse scandal over claims teachers were promoting the spread of Islamic extremism in secular schools . Washwood Heath Academy headteacher Bev Mabey said confirmed a staff member had been suspended in June. 'Washwood Heath Academy Trust can confirm a member of staff has been suspended. 'An investigation is ongoing and it would inappropriate to comment further at this time.' Washwood Heath teaches 1,400 boys and girls from the age of 11 to 18, most of whom are Muslim.

"Scotland produced a stunningly fresh performance that matched ambition with finishing skills at BT Murrayfield on Saturday evening with four tries running up a match-winning 31-10 lead inside 45 minutes. The brothers Richie and Jonny Gray marked their first Test match together by opening the scoring for Scotland, responding to a breakaway try by Argentina flanker Javier Ortega Desio in the second minute with two scores within minutes of each other. The locks were at the heart of a dominant display by the Scotland pack which left the usually steamrollering Pumas pack looking a pale shadow of themselves. Ross Ford was bang on with his lineout throws, newcomer Blair Cowan was a skillful and consistent presence at the breakdown to cause problems for Argentina in attack and Glasgow Warriors duo Adam Ashe and Rob Harley combined well in the loose to maintain Scotland’s front-foot tempo. Jonnny Gray scores his first try for his country en route to Scotland's victory against Argentina . Earlier, brother Richie Gray had opened the scoring for the home side . Jonny Gray is mobbed by his team-mates as they celebrate a second try for the home side . New Scotland coach Vern Cotter led his side to victory on his Murrayfield debut . Greig Laidlaw was named the man of the match after an influential performance . Scotland: Hogg; Maitland, Bennett, Dunbar, Seymour; Russell, Laidlaw (c); Dickinson, Ford, Murray, R Gray, J Gray, Harley, Cowan, Ashe. Subs: A Strokosch for Cowan 60mins, S Lawson for Ford, H Pyrgos for Laidlaw, both 64, D Weir for Russell 65, Reid for Dickinson, Hamilton for R Gray, both 69, Cross for Murray 70, Lamont for Dunbar 75, Laidlaw for Pyrgos 79. Scorers: Tries – R Gray, J Gray, Maitland, Hogg, Seymour; Pen – Laidlaw; Cons – Laidlaw 4. Argentina: Tuculet; Imhoff, Bosch, Hernández, Montero; Sánchez, Landajo; Ayerza, Creevy, Herrera, Lavanini, Guillemain, Baez, Desio, Senatore. Subs: Isa for Baez 17mins, Chaparro for Herrera 45, Iglesias 50, Cubelli for Landajo 58, Agulla for Bosch 60, Ponce for Guillemain 69. Scorers: Tries – Desio, penalty, Cubelli 2; Pen – Sanchez; Cons – Sanchez, Hernandez 3. Another key figure in the Scotland performance was scrum-half Greig Laidlaw. The skipper looks a revitalised performer since his move to Gloucester in the summer and he created numerous chances with his speed of thought and movement across the new hybrid Murrayfield turf. It was his break from a quick tap-penalty that set up the third try, the scrum-half delivering a fine pass off his left-hand to wing Sean Maitland for the winger to sprint in and when Laidlaw repeated the trick minutes after half-time it was Stuart Hogg who benefited and finished off in the right-hand corner. Scotland were rampant at this stage, a team playing with great ambition and showing the skills so conspicuous in recent years only by their absence, and in truth they should have been further ahead by that stage but Laidlaw missed a couple of penalties and Hogg another, the younger Gray squandered a great chance with mark Bennett by taking the wrong option and another penalty infringement cost the Scots another score. There was an inevitability about the way their pace dropped with Scotland having virtually wrapped it up and Argentina came back at them in the final half-hour. Their pack got on the ball, managed to take play through the phases they had been dearly lacking in the first hour and Scotland’s defence was made to work harder to keep them at bay. This Scotland managed for the most part until being reducedin number. The Argentina attack was aided by yellow cards for Rob Harley and Jim Hamilton in the final quarter – the latter being sin-binned within minutes of coming off for a team penalty.

It was an entertaining game with plenty of tries to savour but the crucial statistic was that this was Scotland’s first win over Argentina, a team that has overtaken Scotland in the rankings in recent years, in five meetings at Murrayfield. A tide turning perhaps? It is too early to say that, and it may be different when New Zealand pitch up next week after beating England, but for now Scotland have uncovered a new buoyancy fuelled by the potential of a new-look squad and that has been a long time coming for the home faithful in this fixture.

"Robert Knight, pictured, has been on the run for the past six years having fled Britain after police seized 6kg of cocaine at Heathrow Airport in April 2008 . A wanted drug smuggler has been arrested in the middle of a game of poker in a swoop by armed police. Robert Knight, 53, from Walsall, was held in Saffy's sports bar in Calpe near Benidorm in southeast Spain last night after six years on the run. He was enjoying a game of Texas Hold'em poker when gun-wielding officers burst in and arrested him under a European Arrest Warrant. Knight, accused of a conspiracy to import cocaine, had previously been named on a most wanted list of British criminals who had fled to Spain. Hank Cole, Head of International Operations for the UK's National Crime Agency, said: 'Knight is believed to be a member of an organised crime group involved in the importation and distribution of illegal drugs. 'He had been on the run for a number of years but we were able to track him down. Spain is not a safe haven.' West Midlands Police seized six kilogrammes of cocaine at Heathrow Airport in April 2008 and arrested five men, who were later jailed, but had been looking for Knight ever since. Inspector Dave Simpson from the force said: 'I am delighted that Knight has been caught, it has been a long time coming. 'This just demonstrates that there is no hiding place for criminals and we will work with police forces from other countries along with the National Crime Agency to seek them out.' Knight is due to appear at the Spanish National Court in Madrid on Sunday where extradition proceedings will begin.

"Devastated defender Steven Taylor has admitted Newcastle had only themselves to blame for an unprecedented fourth successive derby defeat by Sunderland. Sunday's high-octane clash at St James' Park looked to be heading for a first goalless draw since May 1990 when Adam Johnson settled it with a 90th-minute winner, his third goal in as many visits to Tyneside. Victory was little more than the Black Cats deserved after creating the better chances throughout the game, but it arrived with the Magpies on top and pushing for a winner of their own. Steven Taylor (right) finds himself on the wrong side of Sunderland forward Steven Fletcher on Sunday . Taylor collided with the post during the match, resulting in him needing two stitches in the wound . Taylor said: 'We can't believe it. We were looking at the clock and thinking it would be a draw. 'We were just looking to see the game out. 'Maybe we got a bit carried away. Sometimes you have to shut the back door. It came from our own set-piece so we only have ourselves to blame. 'I just can't believe it's another season that we have been beaten.' Newcastle went into the game desperate not to set a new record for consecutive Tyne-Wear derby defeats and knowing they had a debt to repay to their fans after losing to last two editions on their own pitch 3-0. Newcastle lost in the 90th minute when Adam Johnson fired home against keeper Jak Alnwick . Johnson gestures to the Sunderland supporters at the full-time whistle as he revels in the moment . On a day when both sets of fans put aside their fierce rivalry momentarily - the travelling supporters joined in the 17th-minute applause for John Alder and Liam Sweeney, who died in the MH17 Malaysia Airlines disaster, and their Newcastle counterparts acknowledged their efforts in raising more than £33,000 for a memorial 16 minutes later - the home side started as if they meant business. However, the initial flurry, during which a Black Cats defence shorn of the services of specialist full-back Anthony Reveillere - he had damaged a calf muscle during the warm-up - was at sixes and sevens, failed to produce tangible reward and Gus Poyet's men responded in concerted fashion. As Sebastian Larsson and Jordi Gomez started to gain the upper hand in the middle of the field, Steven Fletcher clipped the crossbar with a side-footed effort and Connor Wickham forced a good save from rookie keeper Jak Alnwick, who did not wilt in the heat of the derby atmosphere. Gomez and Johnson both passed up glorious opportunities to give the visitors the lead, but in the meantime, Sunderland keeper Costel Pantilimon needed every bit of his 6ft 8in frame to get to Ayoze Perez's 63rd-minute shot as it curled towards the top corner. Taylor looked in a bad way as he was assisted by Newcastle medics in the goalmouth during the match . Taylor was disappointed with the result, but says Newcastle only have themselves to blame . But with the clock running down, Johnson held off Moussa Sissoko inside his own half and then set off towards the Gallowgate End goal, finding Fletcher before making his way into the box to dispatch substitute Will Buckley's lay-off from the Scotland international's pass. Taylor, who had two stitches put into a head wound after a nasty collision with the post as he denied Fletcher a certain goal, was left to rue a lack of cutting edge at the other end of the pitch. He said: 'We had the chances. Everything was at the keeper - straight at him. Two or three yards either side of him is a different ball game. 'We are gutted with that, but Adam Johnson is a top-class player and he proved that today.'","Newcastle lost the Tyne-Wear derby after a late Adam Johnson goal .

Modelez Australia (foods) who owns the iconic treat says many Australians are consciously reducing their salt intake for health and wellbeing reasons. They believe older Australians and parents wishing to choose lower salt options for the family will welcome the reduced salt version into their pantries. 'Inspired by requests from around the country, our research and development team here in Port Melbourne, we have created a variety of Australia’s favourite breakfast spread that even more Aussies can enjoy,' said general manager marketing of foods, Mike Waddington. 'We know that Australians don’t want to compromise on the Vegemite taste, and with Reduced Salt, they won’t have to.' So what's the verdict? Is it just as good as it's older brother. A few taste testers told Nine news, 'tastes the same, tastes the same.' 'Pretty good. And the unusual comment, 'tastes like chinese medicine.' So it is really that healthy? Kellie-Ann Jolly, Cardiovascular Health Director, at the Heart Foundation says offering a reduced salt option for such an iconic product is a great step forward, but it remains a high salt product. 'The Heart Foundation encourages all companies to look to reducing the unnecessary salt in their products,' she said. 'Eating too much salt in the long term can increase your risk of high blood pressure, which is a risk factor for heart disease, Australia’s number one killer.' Happy little Vegemites : the low sodium option contains about more than a teaspoon less of salt than the original blend . there's no denying the popular Aussie spread has been a favourite with many for years. The Heart Foundation says about one teaspoon of this salt reduced Vegemite on one slice of bread provides about 40 per cent adequate intake for a one to three year old . Vegemite is most enjoyed on a piece of toast with butter . 'We know that Aussie kids are eating more salt than they need to. If there is no action to improve our children’s food habits we are setting them up for a high chance of heart disease later in life.' 'About three quarters of the salt we eat comes from everyday supermarket foods rather than salt added at the table,' she said. Ms Jolly says about one teaspoon of this salt reduced Vegemite on one slice of bread provides about 40 per cent adequate intake for a one to three year old and about 30 per cent for a four to eight year old. Invented in 1922 by Melbourne's Dr. Cyril Callister, the brand is now owned by American company Mondelēz International. The inventor's grandson, Jamie Callister, told Nine news he's not so sure he'd be so pleased with the changes. The original : Vegemite has been around for more than 90 years and has become an iconic popular spread but now there's a new version for the more health conscious . Melbourne's Dr. Cyril Callister invented the popular spread which has been loved by many Aussies for over nine decades . 'I think he'd be pleased that they'd tried to do the right thing but I think in all honesty, you don't much with something that is tried and true and we all love it,' he said. In the past Vegemite hasn't always had a great reputation for launching new products. In 2009, Kraft brought in a spread combining Vegemite and cream cheese which had considerably less salt and a milder taste to the original. To coincide with the new recipe they ran a competition to give the new flavour a name and it was announced as isnack 2.0, hoping to appeal to the younger market. But the choice instantly drew plenty of criticism and ridicule and only four days after its announcement plans were made to abandon the name, Kraft admitting it may have been a mistake. They later called it 'cheesymite'. The new healthier product has 25% less salt than the original blend and is now hitting the shelves across Australia . The good old original blend : Vegemite is one of the world's richest known sources of vitamin B . We're happy little Vegemites as bright as bright can be : one of the iconic advertisements of the brand . Vegemite is one of the world’s richest known sources of B vitamins, with each serve containing 50 per cent of the recommended dietary intake of Thiamine (B1) and Folate (B9) and 25 per cent of Riboflavin (B2) and Niacin (B3). Reduced Salt VEGEMITE is fortified with additional vitamins, including B6 and B12. Vitamins B6 and B12 are necessary for metabolism, supporting the immune system and brain function.","Makers of Vegemite release a new healthier version with 25% less salt .

"This is the incredible moment a water bomber was used to pour thousands of litres of water on a burning lorry. The plane was called in because the local fire chief feared it would take too long for a fire truck to arrive at the scene in a remote part of Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada. The lorry erupted in flames after it crashed into a road grader on the treacherous Trans-Labrador Highway. Flames: Smoke billows out of the lorry as the water bomber approaches the scene . The pilot straightens out the plane as he prepares to douse the flames . The 47-second video shows the plane straightening out as it rapidly approaches the fire scene on a gravel road that is blocked by authorities. With just a few feet to spare the plane drops a massive amount of water on the smouldering wreckage. The lorry and grader are not visible through the wall of water. The Labrador fire service had been dealing with widespread forest fires all summer and decided not to take any chances, so it requested aid from above. There was a lack of available water to put out the fire and because of the isolated rural location the authorities were anxious that a fire truck would not be able to prevent the flames from spreading to the dry grass and trees. The lorry driver was trapped inside the burning vehicle but the driver of the road grader managed to pull him to safety. Timing: The pilot releases the water at just the right time as he flies directly over the fire . No risks: Labrador firefighters had been battling widespread forest fires and did not want to risk another one . Close call: The driver of the lorry has to be pulled to safety by the driver of the road grater . The amazing footage was recorded last year but it has recently emerged online once again. Shawn Noseworthy, a manager with Humber Valley Paving, was part of a work crew on site when the crash occurred. Mr Noseworthy filmed the remarkable water bombing on his mobile phone.","Truck fire was in remote location in province of Newfoundland and Labrador .

"The fiancee of a man on trial for murdering a black teenager in cold blood has told how they went back to their hotel, ordered a pizza and drank rum and Cokes straight after the killing. Michael Dunn, 47, is accused of murdering Jordan Davis, a 17-year-old, after he refused to turn down loud rap music he and his friends were playing in his car parked outside a store in Jacksonville, Florida. Rhonda Rouer, who was inside the store when the shooting happened, said she heard shots and was immediately told to get in the car by Dunn, who drove them back to their hotel. Prosecutor John Guy said Dunn (left)  fired at the SUV 'with malice in his heart and intent in his hand' while the defense said it happened because he felt in imminent danger. Right: Jordan Davis, a 17-year-old from Marietta, Georgia . The couple then ordered a meal, made drinks and went to bed. Dunn was arrested the following morning. The shooting - which nobody denies led to Davis's death - happened after a shouting match between Dunn and the group of teenagers in the car. Dunn is accused of firing 10 times into the SUV, including several times as the driver tried to get away. One of the shots killed Davis. No one else in the SUV was injured. Earlier in the trial, prosecutor John Guy said Dunn fired at the SUV 'with malice in his heart and intent in his hand' while the defense said it happened because he felt in imminent danger. Michael Dunn, 47, (left) is on trial for a second time, charged with first-degree murder in the November 2012 killing of Jordan Davis, a 17-year-old from Marietta, Georgia . He has already been convicted of three counts of attempted second-degree murder and is facing 60 years in prison. Dunn is facing a retrial on the first-degree murder count after the jury deadlocked at the previous trial in February. Giving her testimony, Rouer said that she was buying chips and wine in the convenience store when she 'heard a pop, pop, pop'. She said she didn't know what was going on until she went outside and her fiancee Michael Dunn urged her to get into the car, then drove off quickly, before she could fasten her seatbelt. State Attorney Angela Corey shows witness Steven Smith a hat and asked him if he ever saw it above the roof line of the car that Jordan Davis was in during the shooting . Rouer repeated testimony she gave in the first trial, saying the couple, who live together, went back to their hotel, ordered a pizza and drank rum and Cokes, then she fell asleep. The next morning when she woke up, the TV was on and she said she saw that Davis had died and she told Dunn she wanted to go home. They drove straight back to Satellite Beach, canceling plans to have lunch with Dunn's son. Dunn was arrested after they returned home that afternoon. The prosecution spent a third day laying out its case that Dunn acted in cold blood when he killed Davis, who was sitting in the rear passenger seat of an SUV next to Dunn's car . Parents: Prosecutor John Guy, right, shakes hands with Jordan Davis's father Ron before the start of the Michael Dunn retrial . Dunn, who had just left his son's wedding, asked Davis and the other teens in the car to turn down the music and a shouting match erupted between Dunn and Davis. The trial was halted briefly Saturday when a juror was dismissed. The dismissal followed a column posted online by Jacksonville alternative publication Folio Weekly that quoted a one-time prospective juror who was not picked after he said he had written for the publication. Richard David Smith III told the publication that the juror who was picked had questioned State Attorney Angela Corey's competence during jury selection and complained about her sense of humor. Judge Russell Healey, Corey and other attorneys involved in the case questioned the columnist and Smith. One of four alternate jurors will replace the dismissed juror.","Michael Dunn 47, accused of murdering Jordan Davis, 17, in cold blood .

"Two or three cups of tea a day could keep osteoporosis at bay. Tea drinkers are less likely to break a hip than people who never touch the stuff, a study found. Two to three cups a day seems to be particularly beneficial with men and women who drank this amount being 37 per cent less likely to suffer a hip fracture. But not all drinks are equal. Coffee has no benefit, the journal Osteoporosis International reports. People who drank two to three cups were 37 per cent less likely to suffer a fracture than non tea drinkers . It isn’t clear why tea is so good for the bones it may be that the plant chemicals in it boost the building of new bone. The fluoride, calcium and other minerals in tea likely make bones denser and so stronger. Whatever the reason, the finding is important. Some 3 million Britons have osteoporosis and it takes a heavy toll on health, despite various bone-strengthening drugs being available. Around 300,000 weakened wrist, hip, spine and other bones are broken each year and 1,150 Britons die each month after breaking a hip. With many others losing their confidence and independence and hip fractures alone cost the country £2.3 billion a year in health and social care costs, anything that helps keep bone healthy could have a massive impact. The Chinese researchers crunched together the findings of 14 previous studies into diet and risk of hip fracture. Analysis of data provided by almost 200,000 people showed that tea drinkers were less likely to break a hip than others. One to two cups a day cut the odds of a hip fracture by 28 per cent, two to three cups reduced it by 37 per cent and three to four cups by 21 per cent. Around 1,150 Britons die each month after breaking a hip and around 300,000 hip and other bones are broken each year . The researchers, from Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital, don’t say why two or three cups a day is more beneficial than three or four. However, they believe their figures may underestimate just how much tea strengthens bone. Dr Tim Bond, of the industry-funded Tea Advisory Panel, said that tea contains more plant chemicals called flavonoids than coffee. It is thought that these speed up the building of new bone while slowing down the erosion of existing bone. Fluoride, calcium and other minerals in tea likely also strengthen bone. The effect isn’t just due to the calcium in milk or coffee would also be shown to be good for the bones. However, Professor Terence O’Neill, of the National Osteoporosis Society, cautioned that tea drinkers may have a particular lifestyle that influenced the results. He added: ‘The absence of any important risk of hip fracture linked with coffee consumption is reassuring. ‘Further research is needed to confirm whether or not there really are any bone health benefits linked with tea consumption. Previous research has feted beer as being good for the bones. It is thought that high levels of silicon in beer slow down the thinning that leads to fractures, while boosting the formation of new bone. Beer is also rich in phytoestrogens, plant versions of the female sex hormone oestrogen, which helps keep bones healthy. Wine, like coffee, is of little or no benefit.","Tea drinkers are less likely to break a hip than people who don't drink tea .

"Tesco has suspended another three executives amid an investigation into its recent £250million overstatement of profit expectations. It brings to eight the number of those asked to step aside since an inquiry into the error was launched last month by new boss Dave Lewis. The fresh suspensions came as shares in the firm fell yet again in recent days - three weeks after it emerged the chain's sales had fallen at their fastest rate in more than 20 years with £2billion wiped off the retailer's market value. The latest suspensions are understood to involve Dan Jago (right), head of beer, wine and spirits, and Sean McCurley (left), director of convenience . Tesco has suspended another three executives amid an investigation into its recent £250million overstatement of profit expectations . Britain's biggest supermarket said it would give an update on the investigation when it publishes interim results next week. The three latest suspensions are understood to involve Dan Jago, head of beer, wine and spirits, and Sean McCurley, director of convenience, together with another category director, William Linnane. A spokesman said: 'We have asked three employees to step aside to facilitate the investigation into the potential overstatement of profits in UK food for the first half of the year. The new suspensions brings to eight the number of those asked to step aside since an inquiry into the error was launched last month by new Tesco boss Dave Lewis (pictured) 'We will provide an update on the investigation with our interim results on October 23.' Four senior executives, including UK managing director Chris Bush, were asked to step aside last month when Tesco revealed that its most recent profits warning to the City in August was much too optimistic. Mr Lewis said at the time that the suspensions would allow the company to carry out a 'full and frank' investigation and they were not disciplinary or an indication of guilt. Last week it was reported that Tesco had also asked commercial director Kevin Grace to step aside pending the independent review by Deloitte. The group is the subject of an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority. Tesco has issued a series of profit warnings as the sector faces a price war amid a squeeze on market share from discount retailers Aldi and Lidl. Tesco beefed up its board last week by appointing Richard Cousins, chief executive of catering giant Compass, and Mikael Ohlsson, former boss of Ikea, as non-executive directors. Shares in the grocer have fallen by 2.5 per cent in recent days. Earlier this month, billionaire investor Warren Buffett conceded that his investment in Tesco was a ‘huge mistake’. City analysts said yesterday that the most valuable part of the firm is Tesco’s Asian business, conservatively worth the equivalent of 55 per cent to 65 per cent of the group’s current £15billion market value . September 22: Four executives at Tesco suspended after the supermarket giant admitted it overstated its profits guidance to the City by £250million.

"A giant 18-metre tall Santa Claus that has watched over a capital city each festive season since the 1960s may have seen in his last Christmas. Looking down on busy Queen Street in the city of Auckland on New Zealand's North Island, the huge icon has been deemed unworthy of the $180,000 bill it takes to care for him each year. Locals know the figure for his 'creepy' winking eye and wagging finger, The New Zealand Herald reported, but they're also devastated to see him go. Scroll down for video . This giant Santa that has looked over Auckland for more than half a century may have seen his last Christmas . Tipping the scales at five-tonnes the Santa statue is more than half a century old, and his care was funded by national bookstore chain Whitcoulls until December 2008. But according to the website, Whitcoulls announced they were no longer in a position to foot the bill and gave Santa to the city of Auckland as a gift. From then the city centre business association Heart of the City (HotCity) partially funded the creepy statue's existence with the help of some sponsorships. He has been looking over Auckland, New Zealand for more than half a centurt . The jolly man had a make-over and his disturbing winking eye was fixed so his presence  was a little less frightening. But despite this a few years back he was voted the world's creepiest Christmas ornament by an American website. New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key spoke to More FM on Thursday morning, calling the demise of the special Santa Claus a national outrage. 'I remember that Santa there with the slightly dodgy winking eye and the finger. But apparently the winking eye has been fixed up. It's been around since 1960 for goodness sake.' A few years back he was voted the world's creepiest Christmas ornament by an American website . He added that a working bee could be a good idea to help cover the costs, as the government wouldn't be able to help the city out and fund the friendly figure. In a bid to try and save the Santa Claus the SkyCity hotel in Auckland has kicked off donations with $50,000, and encouraged other businesses to join. But for now, the jolly statue is in pieces in storage, and will be kept there until it's decided what to do with him. But one thing is for sure, locals are very upset about the loss of the statue that's knows when they're all sleeping, and knows when they're awake .

Speaking to The Independent she said there had been many interesting men in her life. They include Michael Sarrazin, the ballet dancer Alexander Godunov and actor Vincent Pérez. She said: 'I've been in seven-year relationships three times and one 14-year relationship. 'It's funny how it's always seven. 'Sometimes you get too much information when you spend time with people. You start to see things – bad habits. Gérard Depardieu plays the French head of a finance fund caught up in a sex scandal and Bisset plays his wife .

Bisset rose to fame acting opposite Frank Sinatra in The Detective and Steve McQueen in Bullitt in 1969 . During the 1970s she appeared in François Truffaut's Day for Night, Murder on the Orient Express and The Deep. Last month she joined Jane Seymour, 63, on U.S. TV where they both agree they would not succumb to the surgeon’s scalpel. In the past, Miss Seymour has admitted to minor eye surgery, breast augmentation and trying Botox just once, but she said these days she prefers the natural look. Miss Seymour told The Today Show: ‘I made a choice a while ago that I wanted to age gracefully. I stay away from Botox and all these things because [as an actress] I need my wrinkles. ‘If I smile, I look younger. Smiling is the answer. Everything lifts when you do that.’ Her views were echoed by the glamorous Miss Bisset. During her speech at the Golden Globes she said: ‘I believe, if you want to look good, you’ve got to forgive everybody. It’s the best beauty treatment.’ And on TV she said she had ‘lots of complexes’ about her looks in her youth but she was still not tempted to go under the knife. ‘I don’t think it makes you look younger,’ she said. ‘It makes you different.’","The 69-year-old won a Golden Globe at the start of the year .

"A Texas city cop once hailed as a hero after she pursued a suspect who'd just shot her in the face is now under fire for allegedly shooting an unarmed suspect in the face as he sat in his car a year earlier. Officer Ann Carrizales is a former Marine who was even honored by President Obama for her bravery in the line of duty during the 2013 incident in which a suspect shot her twice, including in the face. But a year before, in October 2012, a lawsuit filed this week claims Carrizales was the one who fired an unnecessary shot the struck a suspect in the face. Stafford, Texas cop Ann Carrizales (right) was once hailed as a hero after she pursued a suspect who'd just shot her in the chest and face. She is now under fire for allegedly shooting an unarmed suspect in the face as he sat in his car a year earlier. That suspect, Jay Mazoch, is pictured after he was shot at left . The suspect was Jay Mazoch, who's now suing Carrizales and the city of Stafford. 'This is a clear example of excessive force - deadly force,' Mazoch's attorney Randall Kallinen told reporters at a news conference held Tuesday in Houston. The suit claims Mazoch, who has no prior criminal record, was shot at point blank range 'while he sat in a motionless car.' The suit claims Mazoch was unarmed and had voluntarily approached Carrizales and her fellow officer near his home, where they were investigating something unrelated to Mazoch, according to Chron.com. The officer he spoke to then rudely told Jay to go away, according to the suit. He said, she said: Carrizales (left) says Jay Mazoch (right) used his car as a deadly weapon, but Mazoch says he did no such thing and was shot for no good reason . 'He said he thought I was a major badass and true American Hero': Reality TV star Willie of Duck Dynasty fame was among those who congratulated Carrizales . However, the suit claims 'police began striking Jay in the face with a metal object at the driver's side window' after he'd gotten into his car. According to audio taken at the scene by the squad car's dash cam, a female officer's voice demands repeatedly that Mazoch turn off the car. Mazoch's voice cannot be heard until after shots were fired, at which point he can be heard explaining that he was 'scared' and had heard shots fired in his neighborhood. Mazoch's attorney claims his client was totally unarmed. 'At no time when Carrizales was in front of Jay's vehicle did the vehicle move forward,' the suit alleges. 'At no time did Jay strike any officer nor display a weapon of any kind.' However, Carrizales claims that Mazoch--who was charged with aggravated assault against the two officers and with DWI--used his car as a weapon. Softer side: The married mother of two is also a former Marine . 'He rolled the window up on her arm and drug her down the street,' Carrizales' attorney Greg Cagle said. Mazoch is asking for punitive damages in this case of what, at least for now, boils down to a classic he said/she said. Mazoch's attorney said it's also a case of heroic cop who is also capable of doing wrong. 'Police officers of course are not all bad or all good,' Kallinen. 'She did a good thing there, and that's fantastic. However, a year earlier she shot my client in the face.' Carrizales was shot in the face and chest from close-range during a routine traffic stop in 2013. Despite her injuries, she chased the car and assisted in the arrest of the alleged gunman. After being shot she returned fire, blasting out of the rear window of the car containing the alleged gunman and two suspects. Decorated: Carrizales was honored in 2013 for her valor after apprehending a suspect who'd just shot her in the face . The mother of two was saved, according to police chiefs, by her bullet-proof vest. After continuing the chase, other police units joined her and the suspects were cornered in an apartment complex. Sergio Francisco Rodriguez, who allegedly fired the shots, was located and taken into custody by Missouri City police officers. Her valiant showing won Carrizales the nickname Robocop from her colleagues. Carrizales was honored for her valor with an invitation to sit before President Obama at his State of the Union nine months ago.","WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES Texas officer Ann Carrizales sat before resident Obama at a State of the Union address in honor of her valor .

"Queensland Police are utilising a range of state-of-the-art robots as they carry out thorough searches in Brisbane ahead of the G20 summit. The robot-cops cost an estimated $750,000 each, but Police believe this is nothing compared to the human lives they could save. The hi-tech devices, which are called tEODor  Explosive Ordnance Robots, can be used to disarm booby traps, improvised explosive devices and other dangerous objects. The modern robots are being used during the G20 summit checkpoints as a response capability for members of the Queensland Police Service's Explosive Ordinance Response Team. Queensland Police are utilising a range of state-of-the-art robots as they carry out thorough searches in Brisbane ahead of the G20 summit . tEODor robots can easily lift 100kg, they have four high-resolution cameras and can be equipped with a range of accessories and weapons. In the past, tEODor has been used to  disarm and dispose of bombs as well and utilise its camera to enter undesirable locations to collect data for officers waiting outside. This allows for the police to send in the capable robot when a bomb is detected, without putting human lives in jeopardy. The machines also perform monitoring and investigation of objects in exceptionally dangerous conditions. The hi-tech devices, which are called tEODor Explosive Ordnance Robots, can be used to disarm booby traps, improvised explosive devices and other dangerous objects . The robots are described as being robust, reliable and flexible in use. The innovative bomb disposal system has the ability to climb at an angle of 45 degrees. They are designed as twin-track vehicles with extremely good manoeuvrability and good properties on open ground. Both the vehicle and the manipulator have to be operated with extreme delicacy. tEODor robots are designed to provide enhanced bomb disposal capabilities to explosive ordnance disposal teams . When climbing up slopes or on a steep gradient, safety brakes kick in automatically and hold the robot in place. The robots assist with reconnaissance of suspect devices, including providing camera and X-ray vision. The tEODor's conduct post-blast examinations and remotely render safe IEDs, either insitu or by removing to another location.

"A nuclear power plant will be built in Britain for the first time in a generation after the EU finally signed off the project today – but will cost £8 billion more than expected. The new plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset will be funded by a levy on household electricity bills, amounting to around £8 a year, for 35 years. Brussels had launched a probe into the project amid fears the £17.6billion government subsidy for French firm EDF to build the plant broke EU rules banning unfair ‘state aid’ for companies. But the EU today revealed it had struck a deal with the Government to cut the subsidy by £1billion, giving the project the go ahead. However, European commissioners revealed the costs of building the nuclear power station had rocketed by 50 per cent – before construction had even started. Britain will get its first nuclear power station in a generation after the EU signed off on a deal with French firm EDF to build a reactor at Hinkley Point in Somerset . The Government claimed the new power station would cost £16 billion to build. But the EU Commission, which has been examining the project since December, said the real cost would be £24.5billion. The two reactors planned for Hinkley, which will provide power for about 60 years, are a key part of the coalition's drive to shift the UK away from fossil fuels towards low-carbon power. The nuclear power station is expected to begin operating in 2023. The approval comes a year after headline terms of the subsidy contract were agreed by the UK government, guaranteeing EDF and its partners a price of £92.50 – twice the current market price of electricity - for each megawatt-hour of power that the reactors generate over a 35-year period. Commission Vice-President Joaquín Almunia, in charge of competition policy, said: ‘After the Commission's intervention, the UK measures in favour of Hinkley Point nuclear power station have been significantly modified, limiting any distortions of competition in the Single Market. ‘These modifications will also achieve significant savings for UK taxpayers. On this basis and after a thorough investigation, the Commission can now conclude that the support is compatible with EU state aid rules.’ But Greenpeace slammed the agreement as a ‘world record sell out’. David Cameron, at Hinkley Point B in Somerset last year,  claims the new nuclear power station  will create thousands of new jobs and cut energy bills . The environmental group's legal adviser Andrea Carta said: ‘There is absolutely no legal, moral or environmental justification in turning taxes into guaranteed profits for a nuclear power company whose only legacy will be a pile of radioactive waste. This is a bad plan for everyone except EDF.’ David Cameron has hailed the deal as 'a very big day for our country' and boasted that Hinkley Point C would be the first of many new nuclear power stations in Britain. The Prime Minister added: 'The first time we’ve built a new nuclear power station for a very long time in our country. Other governments have promised it, they’ve failed to deliver it. 'This government has a long-term economic plan for Britain, and we’re delivering, including this vital nuclear power station which we hope will be the first of several other nuclear power stations, kickstarting again this industry, providing thousands of jobs and providing long-term safe and secure supplies of electricity far into the future.' ‘What this is an example of is government getting behind industries of the future that are a vital part of our long-term economic plan, that will provide secure and safe long-term supplies of electricity and energy for our country, and at the same time provide thousands of jobs. 'This is about long-term planning for our economy, for our energy security and for jobs. That’s what this is about.' EDF will get a guaranteed price for the electricity it generates for decades, which will be added to household bills when the plant is up and running in ten years’ time. Ministers argue that the plant will save consumers money compared with building offshore wind farms or importing gas from abroad. The new power station, known as Hinkley C, will have two reactors. It is the first nuclear plant to be built in the UK since Sizewell B in Suffolk was completed in 1995. The Government said building a new fleet of nuclear power stations could reduce bills by more than £75 a year in 2030. At full capacity the two reactors could provide up to seven per cent of the country's energy needs. Almost two-thirds of the nation's existing electricity generation is due to be turned off in the next 15 years, adding to the urgent need for new power plans, minister say.","New plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset  funded by levies on  electricity bills .

"Tourists are risking their lives to visit the 'blue fires' of Indonesia's Kawah ljen volcano after dark. The active volcano, part of the ljen string of volvanoes in East Java, releases sulphuric gas which ignites to send electric blue flames five metres into the night skies. The burning sulphur, which looks red during the day, pours down the sides of the volcano like neon lava at night. And although officially off limits, the light shows are drawing international crowds, with visitors paying local sulphur miners to take them deep into the crater after the sun goes down. More than a dozen, mostly miners and one foreign tourist, have reportedly died from the poisonous sulphur fumes over the last thirty years. The local miners, who rely on the sulphur for their livelihoods, work in the heat of the bottom of the crater to collect the material without protections. They run ceramic  pipes  from the side of the mountain to collect the highly toxic molten chemical before it is cooled, broken up and carried away for sale. The crater lake is said to be the most toxic of its kind in the world, with a similar ph level to that of battery acid.

"A survivor of the apparent massacre of dozens of students in Mexico has told of his narrow escape from the gang of corrupt police officers and drug cartel hit men who ambushed them. State prosecutors believe more than 40 students who went missing last month after a violent clash with officers on the outskirts of Iguala were rounded up, killed and thrown in mass graves. One of those who escaped said the students were travelling in buses which they had seized for a protest when they were blocked by a police car. On high alert: A Mexican soldier patrols in Iguala, Guerrero state, where dozens of students went missing after allegedly being ambushed by corrupt police officer and hit men, rounded up and dumped in mass graves . Macabre: A clandestine grave is seen in Iguala. State officials are trying to determine whether 28 bodies found in pits are of the students who were attacked by local police . The 19-year-old, who wants to be known as Eusebio for fear of reprisals, said the officers then opened fire as the students got off the buses, killing at least one and injuring several others. 'The shooting carried on for a long time, he told Global Post. 'More police arrived and were firing at us. I lay down in the back of the bus.' Then, after ambulances and journalists appeared at the scene, he said more officers arrived with gunmen in plain clothes, later identified by prosecutors as members of a ruthless gang of assassins who work for the Beltran Leyvan Cartel. As more shots rang out, some officers began bundling the students into the back of patrol cars, at first giving the impression they were rescuing them. But Eusebio said: 'They were hitting the students as they took them. People were also scared about being shot so they gave themselves up. 'They thought they would just be arrested. But something else awaited them.' Hunt: A forensic investigator works at the site of the mass graves, near Iguala in Mexico . Sensing things were seriously amiss, Eusebio ran to safety - and later found out that his intuitions had saved his life. When the students reassembled back in at his University in Tixtla, there were 43 missing and it is now believed they were executed after the ambush. Guerrero's attorney general, Inaky Blanco, said on Sunday that 28 bodies have been found at burial sites so far, and it is 'probable' that some of the missing  students are among the remains found. Mexican President . Enrique Peña Nieto vowed on Monday to hunt down those . responsible for the apparent massacre that authorities say involved local . security officials. He said the motive of the killings was unclear. Other local officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, . told Reuters that at least 34 bodies have been discovered. Remote spot: Officers stand watch near the site of the mass grave on the outskirts of Iguala in Mexico . In his first comments on the incident, Peña Nieto said the . federal government would identify those behind the massacre and . make sure they face justice. 'We need to find the truth and make sure the law is applied . to those responsible for these outrageous, painful and . unacceptable acts,' he said in a four-minute-long televised . statement. He did not take questions. Blanco said on Sunday that two gang hitmen have admitted . killing 17 of the missing students with the help of security . officials. The likelihood of official involvement creates a major . headache for Peña Nieto, who has sought to shift attention away . from Mexico's gangland violence and onto a batch of economic . reforms he has driven through Congress. Angel Aguirre, the governor of Guerrero state, said he was . certain the students were killed by gangs in cahoots with the . police. Forensic workers arrive at the morgue: Relatives of the missing have given DNA samples for identification . He added that he expected at least some of the bodies in . the mass grave would be those of the students, but said tests . still needed to be completed to make sure. 'It could well be them, I don't rule it out, it's a very . real possibility,' Aguirre, who has been criticized for not . doing enough to clean up the state and keep a lid on the rampant . violence, said in a radio interview. Some 22 local police have been arrested in connection with . the violent incidents in Guerrero. The fugitive mayor of Iguala, Jose Luis Abarca, is also . being investigated for possible involvement in the crimes, as is . the head of security for Iguala. Blanco said the leader of a local gang known as the . Guerreros Unidos conspired with security officials to carry out . the killings. Peña Nieto took office two years ago pledging to end a wave . of violence that has killed around 100,000 people since the . start of 2007. Though homicides have fallen on his watch, other . crimes have increased, including extortion and kidnapping. Guerrero, which is also home to the resort of Acapulco, has . been one of the most lawless states in Mexico for years.","Twenty-eight bodies have been recovered after mass shooting in Iguala .

"A Sydney Kings basketballer has received racist abuse after he sparked outrage among fans when he elbowed a rival player. Former NBA star Josh Childress was ejected from the court during a match against the Perth Wildcats on Friday night when he struck Jesse Wagstaff in the face as he lined up for a shot. Despite  Childress apologising for his actions, which have gone viral, he has been abused on social media. Scroll down for video . Sydney Kings former NBA star Josh Childress elbows Perth Wildcats opponent Jesse Wagstaff in the face . Wagstaff goes down for the count from the impact at the match in Perth on Friday night . Both teams have a minor scuffle after Childress' actions which he has described as 'out of character' 'I acted out of character and I apologize (sic). I thank the many fans who have offered their support! It means a lot!!!' Childress tweeted on Sunday. Initially, the response from fans was abusive but within the spirit of fans slamming a rival player. 'Shame on u, Find a different team and sport.' Micheal Miller tweeted. Jason Mills questioned why the 391-game veteran made the career move to Australia. 'Can't hack it in the NBA? Cant' take a screen?

"Rich Californians are having their days at the beach ruined - by a huge pileup of reeking seaweed. Residents of Laguna Beach, in Orange County, have recently come face-to-face with record volumes of pungent kelp which was washed up on the shore by ocean currents. The odorous plantlife usually stays clinging to reefs offshore, far from surfers' noses, but warmer waters in the Pacific this year loosened the plants' grip. Stench: The washed-up kelp on Laguna Beach, California, is the worst in at least 20 years . Because warm water carries less nutrients, the plants are more likely to detach from the reefs in hope of ending up somewhere better. This, combined with strong currents to wash them inland, has piled kelp high up and down the Southern California shoreline. Steve May, Laguna's director of public works, told the LA Times that in his two decades working along the beach the kelp situation is the worst it's ever been. Unpleasant: The pungent weed is now in abundance thanks to strong currents and warm water . Eco-friendly: One expert pointed out that kelp washing up helps the environment by bringing beach hoppers (pictured) along with it . However, while many, including local authorities, are not keen on the new vegetation changing the character of the beaches, others have praised it for bolstering local eco-systems. Nancy Caruso, a marine biologist, pointed out that the slimy plants bring with them tiny sealife called beach hoppers, which in turn feed offshore birds. The process of kelp being washed away from the beach by outgoing tides also releases nutrients into the sand, Caruso, who organizes a kelp festival, explained. However, waste management in the area take a dimmer view of the reeking weeds, with crews often scooping up the detritus and taking it away to dry in the sun. Afterwards the waste material is added to other green mulch and recycled into landfill cover.","Residents of California town confronted with heaps of stinking kelp .

"Accused: Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe faces calls to resign over claims he leaked details . Britain's top police officer was accused by a senior Tory MP last night of ‘undermining the judicial process’ in a growing row over the Andrew Mitchell ‘Plebgate’ affair. Scotland Yard Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe faces calls to resign over claims he leaked details on the progress of an inquiry into the controversy. He is also accused of breaking his own rules by not recording meetings with journalists. The inquiry into the Plebgate incident last September – which cost Mr Mitchell his job as Tory chief whip – looked into whether there was criminal misconduct by any of the officers involved. A file has been sent to the Crown Prosecution Service. Tory MP David Davis has now accused Sir Bernard of briefing reporters that the investigation found no evidence that the officers lied. Mr Mitchell admits swearing at officers who refused to let him cycle through the main gate to Downing Street, but denies calling them ‘plebs’. The Commissioner met journalists twice in late March, and Mr Mitchell was furious when stories appeared claiming the police inquiry had turned up no evidence to support him, because it suggests he lied. In a letter, Mr Davis has now accused Sir Bernard of ‘compounding’ the ‘assault on the reputation of Mr Mitchell’ by the officers involved. And former Justice Minister Crispin Blunt said Sir Bernard’s position will be ‘untenable’ if it is found he leaked information on the inquiry to the media. Mr Davis said information on any findings of the inquiry should have been ‘restricted’, and revealing it ‘undermines the judicial process and the public’s confidence in the impartiality of the system’. He also accused Sir Bernard of breaking his own rules on engaging with the media by not recording the meetings with two newspapers. A report by Elizabeth Filkin, the former Parliamentary standards commissioner, said police should record all conversations with journalists. Asking about the media briefings, Mr Davis said: ‘Did you give them any grounds whatsoever to write that there was no evidence that police officers had lied? All of these questions would be unnecessary if you were able to provide a record of the conversations. This is, of course, a breach of the Filkin guidelines. ‘It is, even more seriously, a breach of the guidance that you issued to your own officers in May of last year.’ Mr Mitchell admits swearing at officers who refused to let him cycle through the main gate to Downing Street, but denies calling them ¿plebs¿ . Mr Davis suggested the top officer may have been misleading when he claimed to have no direct knowledge of the Plebgate inquiry. The MP said Sir Bernard received regular briefings on the progress of the controversial investigation from one of his most senior colleagues. Mr Blunt said the affair is ‘very important’ because it drives to the heart of the integrity of police and public trust in their work. He told Channel 4 News Sir Bernard’s position is ‘very difficult to be tenable’ if he did leak details of the report. He called on the officer to come clean on exactly what happened, saying it is a ‘wretched position’ for information to be ‘dragged out of him’. Mr Blunt said: ‘He now needs to be absolutely transparent if he is going to be able to continue in his position.’ Mr Mitchell was furious at stories claiming the police inquiry turned up no evidence to support him because it suggests he lied. He admits swearing at armed officers who refused to let him cycle through the main gate to Downing Street, but denies using the word ‘pleb’. As well as costing Mr Mitchell his job as chief whip, the row led to the arrest of three PCs, and one of their relatives, for offences including misconduct and leaking. Tory MP David Davis has now accused Sir Bernard of briefing reporters that the investigation found no evidence that the officers lied . Friends of Mr Mitchell used Freedom of Information laws to reveal that Sir Bernard had a private meeting with journalists. The Met confirmed that the meetings took place but said no records were kept about exactly what was said. The allegations are embarrassing for Sir Bernard because he has banned his officers from holding off-the-record conversations with the media. He has said: ‘There should be no more secret conversations with journalists and officers should make a note of all meetings with reporters.’ But in an email to a senior Home Office official explaining his actions on the Plebgate row, Sir Bernard said no notes were kept. He said: ‘Because the terms of engagement for these meetings were that these were non-reportable briefings, we did not keep a note of the areas that were discussed.’ Scotland Yard opened a criminal inquiry after discovering an email from an independent witness to the Plebgate clash was in fact from an off-duty police officer who was not present. Detectives were tasked with discovering if information was deliberately leaked to the media and whether officers conspired to ‘stitch-up’ Mr Mitchell. Mr Mitchell reacted angrily when articles were published about the progress of the inquiry in late March. He blamed the Met and described the leak as ‘a dishonest and illicit attempt to blacken my name and destroy my career.’ In a statement, the Met admitted notes were not kept of the ‘not for publication’ meetings with journalists but will be in future. A spokesman said the Commissioner had made ‘clear that he had not seen the file sent to the CPS and there was no compromise to any investigation’.","It is claimed Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe leaked details on the progress of an inquiry into the controversy .

"Every day we see a sunset as Earth rotates and the sun moves below the horizon - but what if you flew in the direction of Earth’s rotation so the sun never fully set? That’s exactly what one photographer did, flying in a small plane with a pilot and snapping a picture of the sun from every time zone. The result is a montage of images that show’s the sun never setting, as the photographer and his pilot raced against time to keep pace with Earth’s spin. Scroll down for video . Brighton photographer Simon Roberts chased the sun around the plane to capture a picture of a sunset in all 24 time zones (entire collection shown). In a plane with a pilot and co-pilot, he travelled around the North Pole, which meant they could travel at a speed that kept pace with the sun . For the video, called Chasing Horizons, Simon Roberts from Brighton, and his pilot travelled to the North Pole. When the sun’s light passes through the atmosphere, it is refracted by particles. In the process light is moved towards the red end of the visible light spectrum, which makes it appear red to us on Earth. This is basically because light has to travel further through the atmosphere when the sun is lower. And this means that more light is refracted, so the effect is more apparent when the sun sets. Here the distance between time zones is small, letting the airplane more easily keep up with the velocity of Earth. If they had attempted the stunt at the equator, they would have needed to fly at more than 1,000mph (1,600 km/h). The result is a picture of a sunset in each of Earth’s 24 time zones. ‘When I first got the call from this job my initial reaction is: “how the hell are they going to do this?” photographer Mr Roberts explains in the video. They had to account for the angle of Earth, wind, refuelling stops, aircraft capability and temperature to make the mission a success. ‘I never thought I would make a series of work about sunsets because it is probably one of the most clichéd things to photograph,’ explained Mr Roberts. ‘You type sunset into Google and you’ll come up with 100 million photographs. 'So how can you do something different, how can I as a photographer create a series that is any different from the millions of photographs you see every day? ‘And here was this idea that took it to the limits, to the edge of what is possible to some extent, of creating almost a perpetual sunset.’ During a single day, Mr Roberts took a picture of the sun setting in all 24 times zones. The team had to fly non-stop with only two opportunities to refuel. The feat was commissioned by the company Citizen Watch. ‘I never thought I would make a series of work about sunsets,' explained Mr Roberts . ‘When I first got the call from this job my initial reaction is: “how the hell are they going to do this?”’ - Mr Roberts explains in the video. The pilot explained how they had to account for the angle of Earth, wind, refuelling stops, aircraft capability and temperature to take the shots (one shown) Starting from Iceland the duo, commissioned by the company Citizen Watch as part of a promotional campaign for their Eco-Drive Satellite Wave F100 watch, made their way around Earth’s circumference, refuelling in Greenland. ‘Our flight route did not previously exist,’ the company explained on its website. ‘It is not a route flown by airlines, or pilots. It had to be calculated precisely for our mission.’ The team completed the mission in late February, when the days were still long, bright and clear and before the Polar Days of March when the sun never sets. In the most remote part of the Arctic Circle, the duo lost their radio connection and navigation system, as was expected to happen. This meant they had to use paper maps and the placement of the sun to navigate. The team flew around the planet at a latitude of 80°, which meant that they could fly at a manageable speed in order to keep up with the sun. Had they tried the same feat near the equator, they would have needed to travel at more than 1,000 mph (1,600 km/h). The speeds at each latitude is pictured . During the first stop, the team landed in Greenland (shown), where they had to refuel and take off again in 20 minutes before oil in the plane became unusable and it was grounded . The team refuelled twice, with the second stop not shown in the video. This is because it was done near the Arctic Circle, where temperatures were around -50°C (-122°F) - too cold for cameras to operate. During both stops, the crew had just 20 minutes to refuel, because any longer and oil in the aircraft would become ‘gloopy’, leaving it stranded. The mission lasted more than 24 hours in total, with a pilot and co-pilot sharing shifts. In the video, called Chasing Horizons, Simon Roberts from Brighton and his pilot travel to the North Pole. Here, the distance between time zones is small, letting the airplane more easily keep up with the velocity of Earth.

"Cardinals fans hurled racist comments at a group protesting on behalf of black teenager Michael Brown following a game on Monday night, startling video has revealed. Footage taken by Argus Streaming News shows a large group of sports fans gathered outside Busch Stadium in St Louis, Missouri as protesters wave placards nearby. The protesters, all of whom appear to be black, were there to call for justice for Michael Brown, the unarmed 18-year-old who was shot dead by Officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson on August 9. Just seconds into the video, a white fan can be seen yelling at the group: 'Get a job!' Scroll down for video . Clash: Cardinals fans can be seen yelling at a group protesting for justice for Michael Brown, the black teenager who was shot dead by a white police officer in August. The groups clashed after Monday's game . Protest: The Ferguson protesters, pictured, yelled that the sports fans were looking at democracy - but the fans responded by telling them to get a job and pull up their pants. Police officers did not intervene . The man turns to the camera and says: 'That's right! If they'd be working, we wouldn't have this problem!' As the protesters shout 'Justice for Mike Brown', the fans drown them out with cries of 'Let's go Cardinals' which quickly become 'Let's go Darren' - referring to the cop who killed the teenager. Later in the video, a white woman yells at the protesters, 'We're the ones who gave all y'all the freedoms that you have!' before other fans yell 'Africa!' and 'USA! USA! USA!' Soon after, another fan tells a protester to take off his hat and 'pull up your pants'. One protester even sticks a piece of paper to the back of his jersey reading: 'I am Darren Wilson'. Still, the protesters refuse to give up, with one man telling the sports fans that they are watching democracy. The group continues to shout: 'We young, we strong, we marching all night long.' Fight: A video shows the crowd drowning out the protesters' cries with chants of 'USA! USA! USA!' At one point, a woman confronted the man filming the video, Argus News' Mustafa Hussein, a former Marine. 'Why are you here?' she says. 'I don't believe you're a veteran. What are you?' 'What do you mean what am I?' Hussein says. 'What race am I? I'm a f***ing Marine.' 'OK - from what level? How far did you get?' she asks, before walking away. Hussein later spoke with the Riverfront Times about the video, and said not a single fan tried to have a rational conversation with the protesters. 'That's sad that it gives our city a really bad look,' he said. 'The sad part about it is the fans that were there, you have no idea if they came in for the playoff game from outside the St. Louis area. 'It really portrays St. Louis as super racist... but there's no way to prove those fans were from here.' Killed: Officer Darren Wilson, left, shot dead 18-year-old Michael Brown in broad daylight on August 9 . A grand jury is expected to decide next month whether to bring criminal charges against police officer Wilson. In differing accounts, police have said Brown struggled with Wilson, 28, before the fatal shots were fired, but some witnesses say Brown held up his hands and was surrendering when he was shot multiple times in the head and chest. If charges are not brought against Wilson, police fear an outbreak of violence not just in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, but across the greater metropolitan area and even in other U.S. cities, according to St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar and others involved in the planning meetings. Police officers in Missouri are meeting almost daily leading up to that decision to ready themselves for all possible scenarios, while also talking with other major police departments around the country.","Video shows Cardinals fans hurling racist comments at protesters after Monday's game at Busch Stadium in St Louis, Missouri .

"Southampton boss Ronald Koeman has confirmed the club are closing in on a loan move for Werder Bremen winger Eljero Elia. The Saints have been left short of attacking options with Jay Rodriguez's recovery from a cruciate ligament injury taking longer than expected and Sadio Mane due to leave for the African Nations Cup next month. Elia, who has played 28 times for Holland, is seen as the perfect man to bolster Koeman's front three as the club look to maintain their excellent start to the Barclays Premier League season. Ronald Koeman has confirmed his interest in Werder Bremen winger Eljero Elia (left) The former Hamburg midfielder has made 28 appearances for Holland . 'He is one of the players on our list to bring in in January - it's still not done but yes, I am interested in the player,' Koeman said. 'If he signs for Southampton, I think he will be a good option. 'We need at least one more player up front because we lose Sadio Mane in January for the Africa Cup. We need another player for that position and he is a good option. 'If he does sign for us, it will first be as a loan deal.' The Dutchman made 33 league appearances for Werder Bremen last season . Southampton are set to lose midfielder Sadio Mane to the African Nations Cup next month . Elia, who is known for his blistering pace and direct forward runs, established himself as one of the brightest young talents in Europe at FC Twente and was named Dutch Football Talent of the Year in 2009. The 27-year-old struggled to fulfil his early promise during subsequent moves to Hamburg and Juventus but has enjoyed more stability at Bremen, where he made 33 league appearances last season. 'He was a Dutch international, he had not such a good period in Germany but I believe in the qualities of the player,' Koeman said. Morgan Schneiderlin attracted interest from Arsenal and Tottenham during the summer . 'He is a wing player and we normally play with both a right winger and a left winger. 'We also like in our style of playing fast people who can play one against one with quality.' Southampton may again have to fend off interest in midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin in January. Tottenham and Arsenal both pursued the Frenchman in the summer but the club stood firm and Koeman insists even a large bid will not prise the 25-year-old away in the transfer window. He said: 'Will we sell Schneiderlin if we receive a very big bid? No, we do not sell Schneiderlin in January.'

"The remains of Ned Kelly have been a mystery to Australian's for 136 years but now scientists say they have uncovered the truth of his burial through a major forensic investigation . The missing skull of the infamous Australian bushranger, Ned Kelly, has been a mystery to Australians for 136 years. It was a question that had been left unanswered until an unidentified skull first emerged in 1979 at the grounds of Old Melbourne Gaol - near where Kelly was buried. Scientists were convinced that it belonged to the outlaw who was hanged on November 11, 1880 at the prison. Yet the discovery proved too good to be true, after DNA testings found that the said skull was not in fact Kelly's. Now scientists have revisited the enigma - this time claiming to have uncovered the secrets behind Kelly's burial and what ultimately became of his skull. The major forensic investigation has been documented in the book 'Ned Kelly: Under the Microscope' with answers to the unsolved mysteries of one of Australia's most renowned criminals, according to Business Insider. Through a comprehensive scientific analysis the truths behind Ned Kelly's death and mysterious skull have been revealed by editor Craig Cormick who collaborated contributions from more than 30 experts. Mr Cormick said the investigation answers what became of his skull, a myth that has been argued for over a century. 'The book explores the science undertaken by researchers at the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine, including identifying skeletal remains, analysing DNA samples from Ned Kelly’s blood-soaked possessions and physically matching injuries on bones to known bullet wounds that Ned Kelly sustained,' he said. The bushranger was hanged on 11 November 1880 at the Melbourne Gaol . Ned Kelly's (pictured, right) supposed skull (pictured, left) was put on display at the Old Melbourne Gaol. Although the skull looked similar to Kelly's shape head, a DNA examination revealed it is actually not his . Kelly was  buried at a mass grave in Pentridge Prison, in Victoria - all but his head . The truths behind Ned Kelly's death and mysterious skull has been revealed through a comprehensive scientific analysis led by editor Craig Cormick who collaborated contributions from more than 30 experts . Back when the unearthed skull was believed to be Kelly's, it was placed on display at the Old Melbourne Gaol but was stolen in 1978. Eventually that same skull was returned in 2009 by Thomas Baxter, a Western Australian farmer. The investigative book published by CSIRO reveals that skull, also known as the 'Baxter Skull', looks similar to Kelly's head shape but a DNA examination revealed that it did not belong to the Australian bushranger. So who is the owner of this skull? And where is Ned Kelly's skull? These questions still remain. Kelly, who's had Australians debate whether the family man was more of a Robin-Hood character or a notorious criminal, was buried at a mass grave in Pentridge Prison in Victoria. Another corrupt identity - Frederick Deeming - was said to be buried close to the bushranger, according to the Sydney Morning Herald's Good Weekend magazine. Deeming, believed to be Australia's first serial killer, was hanged and buried at the prison in 1892 - 12 years after Kelly's death. Forensic odontologist Dr Richard Bassed told the Good Weekend that he had a 'hunch that the skull belonged to Fred Deeming'. 'His head [from the mask] was the right shape to fit the skull and we did several photo-superimpositions of the death masks,' he said. 'The only ones that fitted were Ned Kelly and Fred Deeming.' He said because Deeming was buried near Kelly, it is possible that the remains 'could have been mixed up'. Testings are underway to identify whether the skull is of the serial killer's. But while DNA samples in 2011 identified the 2008 discovery of bones as Kelly's, his skull remains lost. Mr Cormick told news.com.au there are three theories that attempt to answer the mystery of Kelly's skull: During an excavation of the Old Melbourne Gaol it was crushed; it has been buried in secret by a senior member of the Catholic clergy; or it was stolen by craniologist Archibald Hamiliton.

"The country's financial systems could be at high risk of a cyber attack with the personal data of millions susceptible to threat, MPs fear. Politicians have held a string of meetings in recent months amid concern the UK's markets are not being well enough protected against hackers who have the power to disable entire systems virtually. The House of Commons Treasury Select Committee is reportedly looking further into fears which rise after one of the biggest security breaches in banking history at JP Morgan. The UK financial sector could be susceptible to cyber attacks, it has been claimed, following recent investigations . The information of seven million businesses and more than 70million households was compromised by the cyber attack in the summer. Andrew Tyrie,the chairman of cross-party Treasury Select Committee, said banks were constantly at risk. 'The Treasury Committee has been looking at this issue for a number of years,' he told the Sunday Telegraph. 'The JP Morgan case illustrates the scale of the risks and importance of ensuring that firms, regulators, and, where appropriate, intelligence agencies are taking all reasonable steps to prevent cyber crime.' JP Morgan revealed it had been victim to a cyber attack in the summer in which the details of millions of businesses and households were compromised . In June a group of hackers accessed the details of tens of millions of JP Morgan customers. The bank wasn't aware of the attack until mid-August, closing all access paths to online banking over 90 different servers. In February the Bank of England warned the British financial sector needed to be better prepared for hackers after a simulated attack.","Treasury Select Committee investigating threats against UK markets .

"Colorado Sen. Mark Udall, a Democrat running in a tight re-election race, asked for a do-over during a TV interview on Friday night when he couldn't come up with the names of the three most influential books he'd ever read. 'Oh wow,' he said. 'That's the toughest  – the, uh, three most influential books in my life–' Gathering his composure during taping of a 'news extra' filmed for the website of 7News in Denver, he came up with one. 'Profiles in Courage. The, um, uh –.' After a three-second pregnant pause, the stumped senator asked for another chance. 'Let me think. We can play this over, right? I mean, re-tape this?' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Do-over? Sen Mark Udall (right) asked the 7News interviewer if he could 're-tape' his answer to a softball question about the three most influential books in his life . Coin flip: Udall, the Democrat (left), has surrendered a once-robust lead in Colorado's polls to Republican Rep. Cory Gardner (right) The gaffe was reminiscent of Texas Gov. Rick Perry's 2011 presidential campaign collapse – his 'Oops!' moment during a Republican primary debate – when he couldn't name the three federal government agencies he had pledged to close down if he won the White House. Fellow debater Ron Paul rescued him minutes later. Udall's interviewer, Marc Stewart, tried unsuccessfully to help the senator by moving on to a question about music. 'Well, let's go back to that. What about – what about music? What's the last song you listened to?' Udall came up empty. 'Um, I'm brain dead today, he admitted.' The questions came at the tail end of a recurring two-minute segment in which Stewart asks politicians 10 yes-or-no questions about pressing issues like the death penalty, gun control and immigration reform. A newsroom source at 7News told MailOnline that the embarrassing interview was aired live. But Kim Ngan Nguyen, the station's new media director, later said it was taped 'for web only,' unlike longer 7-minute segments with the candidates that aired on TV. Still, the thumbs-up, thumbs-down options on serious political topics weren't available to Udall in the softball bonus round. Ultimately, Stewart gave him his do-over. 'Uh, let me catch my thought,' the senator responded. Adding to the John F. Kennedy book, he cited 'In the Kingdom of Ice,' a book about a ship's doomed 1881 polar voyage; and 'Centennial,' a novel that traces the history of the northeast Colorado plains and became a TV miniseries in 1978. 'Oops!': During a Nov. 2011 presidential primary debate, Texas Gov. Rick Perry couldn't name the three federal government agencies he had promised to close if he won the presidency . Udall never named the last song he had listened to, but gave high marks to 'Shotgun Down The Avalanche' – even if he couldn't name the song's title. 'I love Shawn Colvin's song about avalanches,' he said, 'because it's appropriate to Colorado.' Udall has little hope of an avalanche re-election victory on Nov. 4. Pollsters put his race against Republican Rep. Cory Gardner within their margin of error. The Real Clear Politics average of recent polls gives Gardner a 3 percentage point lead, but Udall was up by the same margin just two weeks ago.","Democratic Sen.

"When Rosamere Fernanda de Andrade held her newborn baby daughter, she assumed there had been a terrible mistake as while she was black, her child had white skin, blonde hair and blue eyes. Ms de Andrade and her then husband Joao, are both African Brazilian, but their first daughter suffered from the rare genetic condition, albinism. Ruth, who is now 14, was born without any skin pigment and looked considerably different to her parents. Scroll down for video . Rosamere Fernanda de Andrade, centre, thought there had been a mistake when she gave birth to a white child . Ms de Andrade, pictured, was 18 when she gave birth to her first daughter Ruth, who has albinism . Ms de Andrade's three albino children require factor 100 sun block to protect them when they play outside . Since having her first child, Ms de Andrade, 31, has given birth to two other albino children as well as three who are black. Ms de Andrade said the difference between her family is so vast that she is often mistaken for the albino children's nanny. The mother-of-six from Recife, Brazil said: 'When I am with my children I get strange looks because we look so different. 'Once I was leaving a shopping centre with Ruth and Estefani and a security guard asked where their mother was. 'It used to make me angry but I am learning people need educating about what albinism is.' However, Ms de Andrade's biggest worry is how albinism will affect kids Ruth, 14, Estefani, 12, and Kauan, nine. The condition is characterised by the absence of pigment in the skin, hair and eyes - which leaves sufferers exposed to a range of afflictions. The youngsters are so sensitive to sunlight that they need factor 100 sun block every two hours - and not allowed to play outside in the middle of the day. Ms de Andrade's three albino children also have to wear special glasses while outside due to the sun . She said she wanted to help people to understand about the incredibly rare condition . Ms de Andrade and her ex husband both carried the albino gene which was passed to three of their children . Ms de Andrade, who is also mother to Joao, 13, Rebeca, five and Maria, two, who are black, said: 'Having children with this condition poses so many difficulties. 'I'm terrified they will develop skin cancer because they have no natural protection from the sun. 'I need to monitor them constantly to make sure they aren't burning and worry about what damage has already been done.' Ms de Andrade was shocked when she gave birth to first child, Ruth, at age 18, with ex-husband, Alexandrino Barbosa de Sobral, 63. She said: 'I thought someone was playing a trick on me and had switched my baby with a white family's.' And after returning to their village in a poor part of Recife, Brazil, Ms de Andrade struggled with the way friends and neighbors reacted to her baby. Ms de Andrade said when her children were growing up some neighbours made comments about their skin . She said she is particularly scared that they may develop skin cancer because of their lack of pigment . Ms de Andrade, who now lives with partner Robenilson, left, knows her children may also have albino children . She said: 'The neighbours began making comments about Ruth, asking if she was diseased. 'They even suggested Joao wasn't the father and I had been with someone else. It made me angry.' It wasn't until Ms de Andrade gave birth to her second child with albinism, Stefani, one year later that she could put her mind to rest. 'The doctors explained that both Joao and I must carry a gene for albinism and so each time we had a child there was a one in four chance the child would have it,' she said. By the time Ruth has seven, Ms de Andrade began to notice how the condition was beginning to affect her children. She said: 'I started noticing how red Ruth and Estefani became after being outside. Later they would cry because of the pain of being burnt. 'I felt helpless because I didn't know what to do.' Worryingly, Ms de Andrade recalls how on occasions the children's skin would become so damaged by the sun it would bubble. Ms de Andrade said it could only take a few minutes in the sun for her children's skin to bubble dangerously . She said she wants to educate her own children and the public about albinism . She said: 'It can happen so quickly when the sun is fierce. Now I know not to let them into the sun after 10am. 'If they have to leave the house I make sure they wear long sleeves, hats and plenty of sunscreen.' Esthefane said: 'We are like prisoners, we have to stay inside all the time in the summer. We can't play games like the others. We are like vampires.' Ms de Andrade, who lives with partner Robenilson, 37, who is father to Maria, knows there's a chance any of her children could have albino babies of their own. But with the help of doctors she now knows how to manage the condition and will be able to educate her own children in how to care for theirs. She said: 'I would feel like a normal grandmother and accept my grandchildren as I accepted my children. 'The doctor explained everything to me. 'I will constantly apply sunscreen on their skin and I'll also try to let them play mainly in the night.' The Andrade family's story appears in Body Bizarre tomorrow, Thursday November 6, 9pm on TLC .","Rosamere Fernanda de Andrade from Recife gave birth to a white baby .

"Supermarket chain Coles has been banned for three years from advertising that its bread is made or baked on the day it is sold. Coles was also ordered to display a Federal Court notice in its stores and on its website informing shoppers that it had broken Australian consumer law by falsely advertising bread products as 'Baked Today, Sold Today' and 'Freshly Baked In-Store'. The ban only applies to products that are partially baked off-site and then finished in-store. Scroll down for video . The Federal Court has banned Coles from advertising its par-baked bread from being baked fresh on the day it is sold for three years . It does not apply to those that are made from scratch inside Coles bakeries. Federal Court Judge James Allsop made the ruling on Monday after Coles was found guilty in June for making false, misleading and deceptive representations in relation to the freshness of its Cuisine Royale and Coles Bakery products. Coles has been banned from promoting its bread as baked on the day it is being sold or made from fresh dough for three years. It must tell consumers of the ban and that it had been found to have made the false, misleading and deceptive representations by advertising bread as fresh when it had been made and partially baked and then frozen, sometimes months earlier overseas. In a statement to Daily Mail Australia, a Coles spokesman said the supermarket giant would obey the Federal Court ruling, 'including the publication and in-store display of corrective notices'. 'Packaging and marketing materials for the affected bakery products were changed some time ago, and a final check of stores will be complete within 7 days to ensure any affected signage has been removed,' he said. Coles said it would obey the court ruling which includes informing shoppers that it had broken Australian consumer law . The spokesman also added it was never Coles' intention to mislead its customers. 'But we accept that we could have done a better job in explaining how these products are made, and we have already made changes to ensure customers are properly informed,' he said. 'Whether baked from scratch in-store or ""par baked"" by our suppliers and finished in our ovens, our bread and baked goods are excellent quality products which taste great and remain popular with customers.' Consumer advocacy group CHOICE has welcomed news the Federal Court decision. 'Credence claims such as ""freshly baked"" or ""baked today"" can lead consumers to pay a premium in the mistaken belief they are purchasing a superior product,' CHOICE Head of Media Tom Godfrey said. 'Consumers should have confidence that there is truth in product labels. 'The court decision over Coles' conduct is a step forward for consumers and sets a very strong standard that misleading and deceptive representation will not be taken lightly.' 'The average consumer would have found Coles' ""Baked Today, Sold Today"" and ""Freshly Baked In-Store"" claims hard to swallow when it was revealed that breads were actually partially baked and frozen as far away as Ireland, then shipped to Australia and finished off in-store months later.' The court is yet to make a decision on whether to fine Coles, which faces penalties of more than $3 million.","The ban only applies to baked products that are partially baked on-site .

"The sudden death of Melbourne Cup favourite Admire Rakti has led to claims horses are being pushed too hard to race. The Japanese-owned horse collapsed in his stall and died just moments after crossing the finishing line in last place on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the results of an autopsy performed on Admire Rakti showed he had suffered from 'acute heart failure' after crossing the finish line in last place. Scroll down for video . Admire Rakti (left with jockey Zac Purton) died of sudden death syndrome and Araldo (right with Jockey Dwayne Dunn) was put down after breaking a leg following the big race at the Melbourne Cup at Flemington racecourse on Tuesday . The heartbreaking moment that Melbourne Cup pre-race favourite Admire Rakti collapses and dies in the stall after the race . Owners and connections of Admire Rakti outside his stall after he collapsed and died after running last in the race . Earlier in the day, Sydney University veterinarian David Evans was asked on 2UE radio if he thought racehorses were being pushed too hard and he admitted they were expected to perform past their limits. 'That's a value-based question. If you look at injury rates and bleeding in the lungs, you could argue that they are pushed beyond the extremes of what their body can withstand without injury,' he said. Dr Evans said racehorses go through 'massive changes' in their cardiovascular system when they were racing because they were going from a gentle life in a paddock to training at high speeds. In a initial statement, Racing Victoria's chief veterinarian Brian Stewart said the horse had died from the rare 'sudden death syndrome', which occurs in just 0.007 per cent of racehorses. But there is debate over whether or not the syndrome actually exists. Sydney University veterinarian David Evans told 2UE radio on Wednesday morning there was no such thing as the illness. When asked by one of the hosts of the breakfast show about it, Dr Evans replied: 'Sudden death syndrome is just sudden death. It doesn't tell me what killed the horse.' The second horse to die after the Melbourne Cup was Araldo. His death happened after he got spooked by a large flag, kicked a fence and broke his leg in what has been called a 'freak accident'. Vets were later forced to euthanise him as the damage could not be repaired. Dr Evans said depending on the severity of the break, a horse could not live comfortably on four legs because of its weight. He said the horse needed to have the functionality of all four legs for its own welfare. 'The point is we have an animal of incredible weight, 500 kilos, standing on these finely built legs,' Dr Evans said. 'You have to put plates and screws in and plaster casts on and hope they can stand.' Admire Rakti, which won the Caulfield Cup in brilliant style in October, raced near the lead for most of the 3,200-metre journey on Tuesday. The Melbourne Cup is the nation's longest flat race where as the Caufield Cup is only 2,400 metres and the Cox Plate is even less at 2,040 metres long. Before the cup, some experts predicted that Admire Rakti would struggle to run the distance due to his heavy weight. The analysts forecast that the stallion, at 58.5kg, would find carrying his weight at a fast pace over the long distance problematic. No Cup runner weighing 58.5kg or more has won the race since 1975. Leading up to the race, the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses plastered a graphic image of a horse laying down on its side asking race-goers 'Is the party really worth it?' Devastated Riichi Kondo, Japanese owner of racehorse Admire Rakti, walks through the stables after the favourite died . He had appeared emotional as he waited outside the stables, which were screened off with a green tent . Shocked: The team gather outside the stables where punters were told to move away by officials . Associate Professor Chris Whitton - who heads the University of Melbourne's equine orthopaedic research - told Daily Mail Australia weight did not increase the risk of sudden death in horses. 'The increase of sudden death depends on the age of the horse, the length of the race and the number of races the horse had competed in in the two months,' he said. 'Certainly the longer the race, the greater the risk. We also know that the faster the horses are going the more stress it is putting on the horse.' Associate Professor Whitton said research indicated that with every stride a horse took there was about four tonnes of load put on the joints. 'The reason is because of the mechanics of the limbs, horses store a lot of energy in their tendons,' he said. 'Any time those tendons are stretched...  extreme stress is put on the limbs and the heart – which beats at 230 beats per minute as soon as the horse starts galloping – so they're pushing their biology to the limit when they're going fast.' The deaths of the two horses have overshadowed the victory of German-trained Protectionist, who romped away with the biggest winning margin in nearly two decades, and also reignited a bitter debate about the ethical treatment of racing horses. Jockey Zac Purton (in blue) rides Admire Rakti on the way to the start of the Cup with no indication of the tragedy that was about to unfold . Admire Rakti, the pre-race favourite, finished last in the Melbourne Cup and almost walked across the line . Leading up the race, the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses plastered a graphic image of a horse laying down on its side on the CityLink road near Footscray Road in west Melbourne as part of their campaign, asking race-goers 'Is the party really worth it?' and also posted the same image on their Facebook page. The group is now hitting out at the use of whips by jockeys, which it says is pushing racehorses beyond their physical limits. 'We believe that pushing horses beyond their physical limits through use of the whip, and racing horses while under-developed at two years of age are significant factors as to why horses break down on the racetrack,' spokesman Ward Young said. 'We're calling on the racing industry to start running whip-free races and phase out two year-old racing.' Dr Evans said there was no research that showed there would be a lower injury rate if horses under two years old were not used. The Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses claims 125 horses died on Australian racetracks between August 1 last year and July 31 this year. 'That is one horse being killed every 2.9 days,' Mr Young said. After hearing of the horses' deaths, Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop told Daily Mail Australia the incidents as 'very sad news' on Tuesday. 'But racing is a dangerous sport and the jockeys and trainers take all the care that they can and I know that they set very high standards her and terrible accidents do happen,' Ms Bishop said.

"The following poster was created by Club Dakota in Ringwood, Victoria . A Melbourne nightclub that used an image of a woman with her mouth duct taped shut has been accused of promoting their club through violent images. The poster was created by Dakota Nightclub in Ringwood and used to advertise a local party scheduled for October 4. It featured a young woman grimacing with her hands over her face, and her eyes closed while duct tape covered her mouth. The image was removed from the club's Facebook page on Tuesday night. Kristine Olaris, the chief executive at women's agency Women's Health East, opposed the implications behind the poster, describing the woman as appearing 'gagged'.

"The police snooping scandal has deepened after claims forces used controversial surveillance laws to access phone records from major networks as easily as using a ‘cash machine’. It comes after reports that officers have been using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act to seize journalists’ phone records and find out their sources for at least 10 years. In one case Suffolk police confirmed it had used the anti-terrorism power to obtain the phone records of a reporter at the East Anglian Daily Times who had asked questions about a rape investigation in December 2006. Scroll down for video . Claims have surfaced that police used controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act to obtain journalists' phones records from major networks as easily as using a 'cash machine' Three quarters of the UK’s major mobile phone networks has been providing police with customers’ call records through automated systems, according to an investigation by the Guardian. One phone company employee told the paper that the process being operated by EE, Vodafone and Three is like ‘a cash machine’. The only big phone company which requires staff to review all police information requests is O2, according to transparency watchdog Privacy International. Mobile operators must keep a year of call records of all of its customers by law. Police and other agencies are able to access the data without a warrant using Ripa – a law giving authority to most of GCHQ’s mass surveillance and originally intended to safeguard national security. Software providers’ records have revealed the vast majority of requests by police were delivered without the involvement of phone company staff. The incident in Suffolk saw police trawl through the phone records of crime reporter Mark Bulstrode, who now works at the BBC, after he questioned the force about the re-opening of a cold case rape investigation from the 1980s. Boris Johnson backtracked on comments he recently made in defence of the police's actions . He was warned the report could jeopardise the investigation and the East Anglian Daily Times decided not to run it – but police still obtained his phone records to find out who his source had been. Under a Data Protection Act, Mr Bulstrode requested access to records police held on him and made the discovery, which the paper and its sister publication, the Ipswich Star, reported on in December 2006. However it was not known at the time that the records had been obtained using Ripa, which the force confirmed to media trade publication Press Gazette yesterday. Speaking to the MailOnline on Saturday night, Mr Bulstrode said that he was 'disappointed' with the way the police had acted. He said: 'I was investigating a story that was in the public interest and I was disappointed that my phone records were accessed in this way when both I and the newspaper had acted in good faith throughout.' It comes as Boris Johnson backtracked on comments he had previously made in support of the police’s use of Ripa, now claiming it ‘crucial’ that journalists should be able to protect their sources. Earlier this week the Mayor of London, who has responsibility for holding the Metropolitan Police to account, defended Scotland Yard for secretly seizing phone records of Sun reporter Tom Newton Dunn while investigating the Plebgate row. Speaking at the London Press Club Ball this week, he said: ‘It is absolutely vital for our country and for this city that we protect free speech - and, if I can say something about one current controversy, it is of course right that the police should be able to investigate serious criminal matters. ‘But it is also crucial that journalists should be able to protect their sources and to give whistleblowers the confidence to come forward and we will have to insist that in future the police will not be able to see a journalist's phone records without some kind of judicial approval.’ Police also used Ripa to secretly spy on The Mail On Sunday – trawling through thousands of confidential numbers called by journalists from a landline at the newsdesk extending back an entire year. Police investigating former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne over his speeding points scandal secretly obtained the phone records of a journalist . It was after shamed Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne falsely accused journalists of conspiring to bring him down but detectives decided to sidestep a judge’s agreement to protect the source for stories exposing Huhne for illegally conspiring to have his speeding points put on his wife’s licence. Critics have argued that obtaining phone records in this way could create a state database of private communications, although politicians have made assurances it will not. Former Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, this week lashed out at police chiefs who defended the practice after he clashed with Andy Trotter, ex-chief constable of British Transport Police, who insisted there were ‘higher concerns’ than protecting whistleblowers who spoke to the media. An inquiry has now been launched into how every police force in the country has used Ripa to track journalists phone calls. The Home Office will look at police use of Ripa in relation to journalists as part of a wider review of the powers available under the Act to the police and Security Services which was announced earlier this year. Scotland Yard used snooping powers – contained in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers act – to obtain a Sun journalist Tom Newton Dunn's phone records to uncover a whistleblower in the Plebgate affair . The 'RIPA' powers enable police forces and other public authorities to obtain telephone data without judicial approval and were used in the Plebgate affair involving former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell (above)","Reports officers have been using anti-terrorism power for at least 10 years .

"Families are wasting up to £80 a year by leaving televisions and games consoles on standby, experts have warned. Households across the country could make savings of a total £1.7billion a year by turning off all their appliances when they are not in use, according to the Energy Saving Trust. Three quarters of homes with a spare television keep it permanently switched on standby, according to an Ipsos MORI poll of more than 2,000 people found. Some 75 per cent polled are 'worried' about energy bills, yet waste money leaving TVs plugged in (file photo) Experts believe that many people do not realise that leaving an appliance plugged in will consume high quantities of energy. Some 55 per cent of homes have one or more game consoles and nearly two-fifths of those with consoles leave them on or on standby when they are not in use, the poll found. Just leaving a single games console on standby can run up a bill of up to £30 a year in electricity. Three quarters of those polled said they were worried about energy bills. But only half of households which had received an unexpectedly high bill said they had taken action but switching off their unused appliances, the research revealed. Philip Sellwood, chief executive of the Energy Saving Trust, said: ‘We are a nation on standby. Nearly two-fifths  with consoles leave them on or on standby when they are not in use, the poll found (file photo) ‘Whatever your age, gender or the size of your household: our research has found millions of us are unintentionally wasting electricity when we leave our gadgets on standby. It's an easy mistake to make yet it costs us a fortune.’ He added: ‘Televisions and games consoles are now among the primary sources of our everyday entertainment, yet when left on permanent standby they are costing £45-£80 a year. ‘I'm not suggesting we get rid. I'm urging people to take back control of their appliances and switch off when we aren't using them.’ Appliances could also be wasting people's money if they are old, with a fifth of people owning a fridge or freezer that is at least 15 years old. Old appliances are more likely to be inefficient and to have developed faults that the owners might not be aware of, such as a faulty thermostat on a freezer which could mean it is costing £45 more a year to run than it should, the experts said. Turning off lights when they are not needed can save £7 a year, while replacing all the remaining old-fashioned light bulbs with energy efficient ones and halogen lights with LEDs could save around £45 a year on bills.","Three-quarters of homes with spare TV keep it permanently plugged in .

"An innocent man sentenced to death for a child murder he did not commit walked free from prison yesterday after spending nine years behind bars. Manuel Velez, 49, was arrested in 2005 and convicted three years later of murdering his girlfriend's one-year-old son. The former Rio Grande Valley construction worker has spent nearly six years on death row in Texas. But his attorneys have proved that Mr Velez, could not have been responsible for the injuries that killed the boy, since he was working a construction job in Tennessee 1,000 miles  away. Manuel Velez, 49, emerged from Huntsville prison in Texas a free man just after 11.30pm last night . They showed that the laborer had suffered woefully inadequate legal representation at trial  and his former lawyer had failed to point out that his girlfriend had a history of child abuse. An appeals court threw out his conviction and Mr Velez accepted a plea bargain to a lesser charge, allowing him to be paroled. He emerged from Huntsville prison a free man just after 11.30pm last night. 'Manuel never belonged in prison, let alone on death row waiting to be executed. He is indisputably innocent,' said Velez's attorney, Brian Stull of the American Civil Liberties Union Capital Punishment Project. 'My joy for him and his family today is tinged with sadness for the years our criminal justice system stole from him, all because he was too poor to afford better counsel than the lawyer the state appointed to him.' An appeals court threw out his conviction for the murder of a one-year-old child in 2005and Mr Velez accepted a plea bargain to a lesser charge, allowing him to be paroled . Mr Velez, an illiterate Spanish speaker with an IQ of 65, signed a written confession in English he did not understand, following the death of Angel Moreno. The baby was just under a year old when he was taken to hospital on 31 October 2005 suffering breathing difficulties. He died just two days later due to a severe brain injury. Two weeks earlier Mr Velez had moved into the Brownsville home of his new girlfriend, Acela Moreno, then aged 25, the mother of Angel. Initially, both Mr Velez and the victim's mother were charged with capital murder, the Guardian reports. But before the trial began, Ms Moreno accepted a plea bargain with the state of Texas in which she pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of having injured her child by hitting him or slamming his head against a wall. The former  construction worker has spent nearly six years on death row in Texas but walked free last night . Angel's mother  was sentenced to 10 years in prison. She was released in 2010, before being immediately deported to her home country of Mexico, having been staying in the United States illegally. As part of the plea deal, Ms Moreno had agreed to testify against Mr Velez and she told the court that Angel's physical problems only started when her new boyfriend moved into the home. This was despite the fact that she told police in a recorded interview at the time of her arrest that Mr Velez had never struck her son or mistreated him in any way. The jury also never heard about a prosecution expert's report indicating that autopsy results showed that the critical head trauma occurred 18 and 36 days before Angel died. Manuel Velez was arrested in 2005 and convicted three years later of murdering a one-year-old . During this time Mr Velez was not in contact with the child, but was 1,000 miles away on a job at a construction site in Memphis, Tennessee. There was also evidence that Ms Moreno abused her child, and that she had once thrown Angel onto a couch from five feet away when she was angered by his crying. Members of her family testified that they had seen the mother neglect and abuse her young son, the Guardian reported. Her sister revealed that Ms Moreno had once admitted to her that she had bitten Angel on the face. In her own videotaped interrogation by police Ms Moreno also said she had burned Angel with a cigarette. She also told detectives: 'I may have burned Angel's foot when I carried him, but only once.' But the defense lawyers did not call any of the witnesses with this information to testify. 'We should be ashamed of the errors that put Manuel on the brink of execution. He is far from the only innocent person to receive a death sentence,' said Mr Stull. 'A recent study estimated that, conservatively, one in every 25 people sentenced to death in the United States is innocent. In such a broken system of justice, we are foolish and cruel to continue capital punishment.' According to Death Penalty Information Center's director Richard Dieter, 'the release of former death row inmate Manuel Velez in Texas today underscores the many problems that continue to plague the death penalty and the ongoing risk of executing the innocent. His 'case contained a litany of injustices, including police misconduct, prosecutorial deception, ineffectiveness of defense counsel, and untruthful witnesses. 'The death of a child because of abuse is a terrible tragedy, but evidence uncovered after Mr. Velez's trial in 2008 indicates the abuse occurred when he was a thousand miles away.' The DPIC has tallied 146 death row inmates whose convictions have been overturned and who have been freed since 1973 - including 10 in Texas.","Manuel Velez was convicted of murdering his girlfriend's one-year-old son .

"Fraud: Nebil Jouini, who preyed on a 67-year-old woman from Cardiff who he met on holiday and stole from her . A Tunisian man stole from a British woman and 'ate her out of house and home' after he took up her casual offer to stay with her if he ever visited Wales. Nebil Jouini, 28, stole from the 67-year-old 'decent and generously minded' woman after going to stay at her Cardiff home. The pair met at a hotel in Tunisia when the woman was on holiday, and she invited him to stay if he was ever visiting Wales. But Cardiff Crown Court heard that after taking up the offer,  Jouini 'preyed' on the victim's good nature and stole from her. Yesterday he was jailed for nine months after admitting fraud and theft offences - however, he will be allowed to stay in Britain after he is released from prison. The court was told that the woman regularly went to Tunisia on holiday and met Jouini during a visit in September 2013. She said that the pair became friends and at end the end of her holiday, she told him if he was ever in Cardiff, he should contact her. Just a few weeks later, on October 13, he called her saying he was looking for work in Cardiff and asked if he could stay with her. She said he could stay for two night, and he arrived on October 17 - but Jouini promptly asked to stay for the long term, claiming he would contribute to the cost of household bills. The woman refused his request, but allowed him to stay for a few more days - only to discover that Jouini was going through her belongings while she went out to work every day. She said while staying at her address he also 'ate her out of house and home'. Prosecutor Gareth Jones said she 'wasn't happy with the excuses provided' and told him he was no longer welcome at her home. He became abusive and threatening, telling her if she ever returned to Tunisia, he would get his cousin to kill her. 'She didn't take the threats seriously but was concerned,' said Mr Jones. When she threatened to call the police, he packed his belongings and left. She was then contacted by her bank, reporting fraudulent activity on her credit card. When she checked her card statement, she found Jouini had booked a £744 holiday in his own name, a flight for £175 and a hotel room in Bracknell, where  his estranged wife lives. The victim also discovered he had stolen her bank book, mobile phone and a gold bracelet. Jailed: Jouini admitted fraud and theft offences at Cardiff Crown Court, pictured, and was sentenced to nine months in prison yesterday . Kevin Seal, defending, said while his client was in custody awaiting sentence, he had been interviewed by immigration officials. They say no deportation proceedings will follow and he can return to his wife in the UK. Judge Stephen Hopkins said that the whole basis of Jouini's visit to Cardiff was 'a sham' and ordered him to serve nine months in prison. In an interview with a probation officer, Jouini said that he understood the woman would have been unhappy with what he had done to her. But the judge said he believed Jouini was more concerned with his own problems, adding: 'You seem to find it difficult to understand the effect your behaviour had upon on this lady.'","Nebil Jouini met 67-year-old woman while she was on holiday in Tunisia .

"A fisherman who was bitten by an alligator and found his right arm trapped in its jaws made an impressive escape by shoving his hand even further into the beast's mouth. Vincent Dewan, 21, was fishing in the Indian River by Port St John, Florida, when the 10ft animal launched itself out of the waist-height water and clamped down on his arm. The gator started to wrench his arm back and forth, but Dewan avoided major damage by not resisting and moving his arm with the thrashing beast after it struck Saturday.

Big beast: The alligator that attacked Dewan is pictured above being dragged out of the water by trappers . Instead, he thrust his arm deeper into it's mouth in the hope of loosening his grip, according to WFTV. Dewan was catching mullet in the water and putting them in his pocket to use as bait to get bigger fish when he was attacked - and believed that's why the gator attacked him. He told the station: 'I don't think he was actually trying to bite me, I was putting a mullet into my pocket that I'd just caught, and just as I did that he bit the hand I was putting the mullet in with.' Dangerous waters: Dewan was fishing with a net in Port St John, Florida, when he was bitten . 'When he grabbed my hand I just moved my hand with how he was thrashing.' Dewan then described how he made the split-second decision to thrust his arm further in, after which 'he let go and swam away'. The alligator was later captured by trappers on Sunday. The beast is 10ft 6in long, and has lost half of its tail. The attack broke some bones in Dewan's hand, and tore a gash in his palm. He also suffered puncutre wounds on top of his hand . He is currently being treated at Wuesthoff Medical Center in Rockledge, and is expected to make a full recovery.","Vincent Dewan, 21, was bitten in Port St John, Florida, on Saturday .

"A former prosecutor and all-Big Ten footballer player has left an Illinois community in shock after being charged with murdering his first wife on Valentine's Day in 2006. Curtis Lovelace, 45, also previously a school board president, sports broadcaster and educator at a local university, is accused of suffocating mother-of-four Cory Lovelace, 38, at their home in Quincy. He was arrested by police after investigators reopened the eight-year-old case of Mrs Lovelace's mysterious death in her bed. A pathologist and coroner's jury had formerly deemed it 'inconclusive'.

Right, the suspect is a captain in the Illinois National Guard Judge Advocate Corps . Lovelace, who was indicted on August 28, is now facing a first-degree murder charge, to which he has pleaded not guilty. He remains at Hancock County Jail on $5million bond . Perhaps unsurprisingly, the allegations against him are the continuing source of gossip in the 40,000-strong former port city of Quincy, situated along the Mississippi River. 'He just seemed like an average fellow, a very active gentleman,' Mike Cadwell, a barber for 40 years, told the Associated press while giving an older client a trim. 'I'm not sure what kind of a person does that kind of a crime, but he didn't seem to fit that mold.' Lovelace is also a captain in the Illinois National Guard Judge Advocate Corps, a position that has reportedly not been affected by his indictment on murder charges. Public Affairs Director Captain Dutch Grove told the Quincy Journal the case, 'is a civil, criminal matter and any administrative action to discharge would wait until this is adjudicated.'

Above, the house in Quincy where the victim's body was found . Unanswered: Mrs Lovelace's case left many unanswered questions, but no one suspected Lovelace,  the ex-prosecutor, former all-Big Ten football player, ex-school board president and sports broadcaster .

In the 1980s, Lovelace was a star jock at Quincy High School in track, wrestling and football, earning six varsity letters and eventual enshrinement in the school's sports hall of fame. He went on to play football as a center at the University Illinois, where he was the team captain and a two-time all-Big Ten pick. The business major also was an academic all-American - a coup for Lovelace, who has said he got mostly Bs in high school. Indicted: Lovelace was arrested and indicted for suffocating his first wife on August 28 this year . 'I did not come to the University of Illinois as a star athlete or a star student,' Lovelace told the Bloomington Pantagraph in 1990. 'I think I've reached this point with hard work.' In 1991, Lovelace married former high school classmate Cory Didriksen, gained his law degree at Illinois, started a family and became an assistant prosecutor in Quincy. However, on February 14, 2006, he said he returned home from taking three of his four children to school to find his wife lying dead in their bed. According to his account, detailed in the transcripts of a coroner's inquest, Mrs Lovelace had been sick for days prior to her death. However, an investigator said Lovelace failed to summon emergency responders and did not attempt to resuscitate his partner. An autopsy and the coroner's jury later failed to determine the cause of death and Mrs Lovelace's body was cremated, the Quincy Journal reported. 'At the time it happened, we just considered it a tragedy,' Mr Cadwell, 64, recalled. 'I knew there was speculation, questions. But he never seemed to be at the center of it.' It was in December last year that a newly promoted police detective decided to reopen the case and two pathologists weighed in, determining that Mrs Lovelace had, in fact, been suffocated. Following Lovelace's arrest, Ed Parkinson of the State Appellate Prosecutor’s Service was appointed in the case as a special prosecutor, according to the  Journal. Adams County State's Attorney Jon Barnard said that a special prosecutor was requested because Lovelace is a former employee of the Adams County office. Success: In the 1980s, Lovelace was a star jock at Quincy High School in track, wrestling and football, earning six varsity letters and eventual enshrinement in the school's sports hall of fame (pictured online) The case also grabbed the attention of renowned physician and forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden, who looked into Cory's autopsy report, KHQA said. Baden, the primary analyst for HBO's 'Autopsy', has worked on a number of high-profile cases, including reviewing the death of John F. Kennedy. After Mrs Lovelace's death in 2006, Lovelace married twice more. Many around Quincy privately confided that the scandal has been the talk of the town, even if they're reticent about publicly discussing it, citing the community's insular vibe. Each development has received prominent front-page play in the Quincy Herald-Whig newspaper. Football player: Lovelace played football as a center at the University of Illinois (pictured), where he was the team captain and a two-time all-Big Ten pick. He remains at Hancock County Jail on $5million bond . Lovelace's attorneys, Quincy school officials and prominent high school and Illini sports boosters are tight-lipped. Mrs Lovelace's mother, Martha 'Marty' Didriksen, told an Associated Press reporter on her doorstep that her thoughts had fragmented since her former son-in-law's arrest. She declined to say more. Quincy antique store owner Allison O'Donnell, 73, said she was not eager to jump to conclusions about the case. 'Everyone runs their mouth before anyone gets a fair chance [at a trial],' she said. 'But I'm still from the old school — I don't believe it until I see it [play out in court].' .","Curtis Lovelace, 45, is accused of suffocating Cory Lovelace, 38, in 2006 .

"Pensioners in Britain are more likely to die of flu or pneumonia than anywhere else in Europe, a damning Brussels report has revealed. Official figures show more than 80 Britons die from the diseases every day – 70 per cent higher than the European average. Overall, some 138 people in every 100,000 in the UK die from ‘respiratory diseases’ – including influenza, pneumonia, bronchitis and asthma – every three years. This works out at 88,000 people – or 29,000 a year. Britain has the worst record in Europe for deaths from respiratory diseases like flu and pneumonia . Nine out of 10 people who die from flu and other respiratory diseases are over 65, according to the EU report – suggesting some 26,000 British pensioners die from the preventable diseases every year. The EU said poor public health campaigns warning the elderly to get vaccinated against flu was to blame for countries suffering high death rates. In 2011 the former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley scrapped the annual flu vaccination advertising campaign to encourage pensioners to get the jab. After a spike in deaths the Department of Health u-turned – reintroducing the yearly campaign. Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director at Age UK said: ‘These figures are deeply worrying and shows us just how far there is to go to get care right for older people with poor respiratory health or at high risk from infections such as the flu. ‘It is vital we ensure the health service is geared up to meet the needs of frail older people and those living with long term conditions and help them stay as well as possible especially as winter approaches.’ Andrew Gwynne, Labour’s Shadow Health Minister, said old age deaths because they could not afford to heat their homes was a national scandal. Poor treatment: Frank Kelly, 79, died of pneumonia three months after nurses left him outside Worcester Royal Hospital wearing just pyjamas in the rain . Heat your home to at least 18C . If heating the whole house is a problem heat the living room during the day and your bedroom just before you go to sleep . Have your flu jab to protect yourself  from influenza . Look out for friends, relatives and neighbours who may be vulnerable to the cold . Watch the weather forecast and plan ahead . Have regular hot meals and drinks . Get financial support to make your home more energy efficient . Have your heating and cooking appliances checked regularly . Wear a few layers of thin clothing rather than one thick layer . When you need to go outside wear shoes with slip resistant, good grip soles . Mr Gwynne said: ‘Older people living in cold homes is a scandal and we must put an end to it. ‘Labour's promise to stand up to the energy companies and freeze bills will help to protect older people from poor health.’ Former industrial areas and countries where lots of people smoke are also likely to suffer higher flu and pneumonia death rates. The Brussels report said men were almost twice as likely to die from the diseases. Public Health England confirmed that Britain was the worst record for flu and pneumonia in Europe according to Brussels' official figures. Dr Richard Pebody, head of seasonal flu surveillance at PHE, said: 'Although attempts are made to standardise coding of deaths, it’s important to exercise caution when comparing country to country figures like this, due to systematic differences in the way clinicians complete death certificates. 'While these figures suggest UK has a high rate of respiratory death, it also says UK has one of the lowest rates for circulatory deaths, and it is not possible to conclude from these figures alone that the UK has had a higher burden of disease due to influenza' The Government was attacked earlier this week over official advice for pensioners to protect against the cold this winter. The Public Health England document said struggling pensioners should only turn on the heating in one room to stay warm this winter. The new guidance urges those struggling to pay their heating bills to only warm their living room during the day and their bedroom at night. A hot water bottle should also be taken to bed, according to Public Health England. Other 'top tips' to drive down winter deaths include wearing slippers, keeping out the cold with lots of thin layers of clothes – and having regular hot meals and cups of tea throughout the day. According to the report the elderly should heat their homes to at least 18C during the winter to protect their health. Last year's cold weather saw 31,100 excess deaths in Britain, mainly among over–75s. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (left) and his Labour opposite number Andy Burnham (right) clashed in the Commons over the NHS today, amid warnings that the health service needs £8billion more funding . Dot Gibson, National Pensioners' Convention general secretary, said: 'Every year, we get the same sort of message from public health officials. But the number of older people dying from cold–related illnesses is on the rise. 'Putting on an extra jumper or walking around a bit more than usual doesn't really address the fact that fuel bills continue to go up way in excess of people's pensions. 'Warm words are nice – but a warm home is better.' The average household energy bill is now £1,265 a year, £53 more than a year ago. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, added: 'It is shocking that each winter an older person dies every seven minutes from cold weather. 'Turning up the heating is not an option for many older people struggling with high bills.' But Dr Angie Bone, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at Public Health England, said thousands of lives could be saved if people followed the Government's advice. The flu jab is available every year on the NHS to protect adults and some children, at risk. Flu can be an unpleasant illness. But for those who are otherwise healthy, it usually clears up on its own within a week. However, for some people the illness can be much more severe, even life-threatening. Those at risk include: . Anyone in a risk group is likely to develop serious complications, such as pneumonia. The flu vaccine is given free of charge to: . The best time to have a flu vaccine is in the autumn, from the beginning of October to early November. For those not deemed at risk, it is possible to pay to have a flu jab. Boots Pharmacies are offering the vaccination in store. Deepa Songara, Boots flu pharmacist said: 'We spend less time outside and much longer closer together at home or in indoor places. 'This 'togetherness' makes it easier to pass germs from one person to another so it is important to think ahead and try to protect yourself before the cold and flu season really kicks in. 'Busy communal places are ideal breeding environments for winter bugs and simple things like washing your hands or using alcohol based hand gel can help keep you well.'","UK death toll from respiratory diseases 70% higher than EU average .

"Astronauts who flew to 45,00ft to help launch the doomed Virgin Galactic spaceplane that malfunctioned in mid-air today saw the explosion that killed one of their friends, it was claimed. One pilot for the embattled space tourism company was killed when SpaceShipTwo, the advanced plane meant to take passengers into sub-orbital flight, came apart seconds after its mid-air launch. Rick 'CJ' Sturckow was one of the pilots flying the WhiteKnightTwo launching craft, MailOnline can reveal - and so would have been with the killed pilot - still unnamed - minutes before the disaster. Scroll down for video . Explosion: SpaceShipTwo is pictured above blowing apart in mid-air after detatching from WhiteKnightTwo . Alive: Rick 'CJ' Sturckow, right, was in WhiteKnightTwo, top left, as it detached from the doomed space plane . Disaster: One pilot parachuted from the exploding plane, but was still seriously injured. The other died. Neither were named . SpaceShipTwo's engines had kicked in after it detached from WhiteKnightTwo, a twin-hulled airplanes which carried SpaceShipTwo to launch altitude. Two minutes after the split, it malfunctioned, killing one crewmember. Another man parachuted out of the plane, but was seriously injured in the crash and is now in hospital. Speaking to MailOnline today, a family friend revealed how relieved family members have been sharing the news that their loved on is safe. Carol Massa, 72, a family friend of the Sturckows, lives  next door to his 78-year-old mother, Jeanette in San Diego, California. Wreckage: Fragments of SpaceShipTwo were scattered across the Mojave Desert in California today . Fragments: Chunks of plane rained down from the sky after the mid-air explosion, which killed a pilot . She said: 'I have no idea who the pilot was that died I just know that Rick is indeed alive and well, thank God. 'They assured us that Rick was not the one that crashed. She [Jeanette] certainly is very relieved. 'Jeanette's daughter called to speak to his wife Michelle and she reassured them Rick was fine. 'They called to speak to his wife this morning. It's a scary business he's in. 'I think Rick was flying in the other craft that was flying. He was following in the other spacecraft. 'I suspect he would have seen it but I do not know how far apart they would have been. Previous mission: Sturckow is pictured here celebrating after piloting SpaceShipTwo on an un-powered flight . Before: SpaceShipTwo is pictured above being carried by WhiteKnightTwo, which Sturckow was flying . 'I'm sure Rick knows who this pilot is, because there's a small group of them. His name has not been released.' The flight had taken off at 9:30am local time and the two craft had separated at 10:10am. A problem was discovered two minutes later. After releasing SpaceShipTwo, WhiteKnightTwo simply glides back to earth. 'That was pretty scary, I guess it's going to set their whole project back a bit', Mrs Massa said, adding she last saw him about a year ago before he moved up to live closer to the Mojave base. She said Sturckow would not mind if he died piloting a spacecraft as he loves his job so much, in his spare time she said his passion is farming. She said: 'Rick is an adrenaline junkie, he can't sit still. 'Janette knows that Rick would not want to be doing anything else. Rick's theory is if he dies in a spacecraft or gets hauled off his tractor either way is fine because he loves doing both of those things.' She said Rick's family have learned to deal with his dangerous profession over the years, adding: 'They are used to the worry because he's an astronaut, it's just one of those things, you have to go on with life. They have to have that attitude or you go crazy. They just pray he will be OK.'","Rick 'CJ' Sturckow is one of the small pool of Virgin Galactic space pilots .

"Two women are just weeks away from giving birth – using transplanted wombs donated by their own mothers. The expectant mums will be the first to carry children using the very uterus that carried them as unborn infants. The pregnancies are part of a revolutionary Swedish project to allow childless women to fulfil their dream of starting a family. The world’s first womb swap baby, named as Vincent, has already been delivered using an unrelated donor. Now doctors are preparing for two more arrivals – but this time each one is being nurtured in its grandmother’s womb. Scroll down for video . World first: Vincent was nurtured in a donated womb.  It has now emerged that two women are just weeks away from giving birth – using transplanted wombs donated by their own mothers . The news gives hope to Britain’s estimated 15,000 childless women and provides a boost for a similar project in the UK in which 60 women are waiting for a new womb, Pictured, Vincent and his mother after his delivery . The extraordinary procedure, which doctors have likened in importance to the first successful heart transplant, means each womb will have carried two generations of the same family. Dr Liza Johannesson, of Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, said the pregnancies are going well and the mothers are ‘really excited’ at seeing their babies, which are due next month. ‘It is also really exciting to have your mother as a donor,’ she added. ‘It is a very nice gift to give to your daughter.’ The news gives hope to Britain’s estimated 15,000 childless women and provides a boost for a similar project in the UK in which 60 women are waiting for a new womb. Many women will have been born without the organ, others will have had a hysterectomy because of cancer or as a last-ditch attempt stop life-threatening bleeding during labour. Eventually, the technique could also be used on women who have suffered the agony of repeated miscarriages. Using a donated womb also means that expectant mothers can have babies that are genetically their own and experience the joys of pregnancy. Doctors in Turkey and Saudi Arabia have carried out womb transplants before – but none has so far led to a birth. Teams in the US, China and Australia are also keen to start their own programmes. The Swedes have carried out nine womb transplants – and seven of the women have had IVF treatment. Late on Friday night, it emerged that one had been successful – and the world’s first womb transplant baby was delivered. He has been called Vincent – a name derived from the Latin for ‘to conquer’ – to mark the extraordinary lengths his mother undertook to have him. Pernilla Dahm Kähler (left) has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques involved in a womb transplant, said she felt ‘humble and proud’ to witness the birth. Consultant gynaecologist Dr Liza Johannesson (right), of Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, said the pregnancies are going well . (Left to right) Specialist surgeons Andreas G Tzakis, Pernilla Dahm-Kähler, Mats Brannstrom, Michael Olausson and Liza Johannesson attend a news conference, at Sahlgrenska hospital in Gothernburg, Sweden . Born by C-section two months prematurely, Vincent weighed just under 4lb and entered the world with a scream, bringing tears of joy to those who witnessed his arrival. His 36-year-old mother, who worked until the day before he was born, said: ‘As soon as I felt this perfect baby boy on my chest, I had tears of happiness and enormous relief. ‘I felt like a mother the first time I touched my baby and was amazed that we finally did it. ‘I have always had this large sorrow because I never thought I would be a mother – and now the impossible has become real.’ A keen athlete, she was devastated when she was told at the age of 15 that she did not have a womb. She was able to carry her own child after a 61-year-old friend offered to donate her womb. Despite being long past menopause, her womb worked normally during the pregnancy. Consultant gynaecologist Dr Johannesson described Vincent’s birth, which took place a month ago but has remained a secret until now, as ‘breathtaking’. ‘It was like having your own child. It was the same feeling – no one could really believe it.’ The doctor, who was pregnant with her third child at the same time as Vincent’s mother, said: ‘I was more involved in that pregnancy than in my own.’ Vincent is now back home with his parents, who have not been named. He is breastfeeding and growing well. Dr Johannesson added: ‘They are doing perfect. The parents told me that first night at home was horrible because he was screaming – like any other child.’ Vincent’s father said: ‘We now have the most amazing baby. He’s no different from any other child, but he will have a good story to tell.’ Mats Brannstrom and his team performing a womb transplant in Gothenburg, Sweden . The first British transplants could be carried out as soon as next summer – using wombs from dead donors. Richard Smith, head of the charity Womb Transplant UK, is ready to give five women the chance to have children using the procedure and is applying for ethical approval. Some 60 potential patients have already come forward. But Mr Smith, who has already spent significant amounts of his own money on years of research, only has £40,000 of the £500,000 needed for the surgery. Unlike the Swedish project in which living donors are used, the consultant gynaecological surgeon plans to use wombs from women who have died young. He said he is uncomfortable about removing a woman’s womb for an operation that is not essential to save a life. He claims taking the organ from a dead donor will allow him to harvest extra tissue and the major blood vessels needed to take the strain of pregnancy. One of his potential patients, Sophie Lewis, said: ‘To feel your own child growing inside you would be a miracle.’ The 30-year-old, who said she burst into tears of joy when she heard of Vincent’s birth in Sweden, added. ‘It would be an absolute gift, the most amazing gift ever.’ Mr Smith added: ‘In many women, there is a deep yearning to carry children and this is not fulfilled by surrogacy. ‘I’ve had my own crisis with this project over the years – are we doing the right thing? ‘But when you meet women in this position, I know in my heart of hearts that if we do it safely, it is the right thing.’ Henrik Hagberg, a professor in foetal medicine at King’s College London, who did ultrasound scans of Vincent throughout the pregnancy, said: ‘I was quite astounded that everything went so well. I think that’s quite fantastic.’ Pernilla Dahm Kähler, who along with Mats Brännström of Gothenburg University has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques involved in a womb transplant, said she felt ‘humble and proud’ to witness the birth. Dr Dahm Kähler helped remove the donor womb from the 61-year-old woman – and transplant it in Vincent’s mother. Professor Brännström said the birth provides scientific evidence that the technique works, adding: ‘It gives us scientific evidence that the concept of uterus transplantation can be used to treat uterine factor infertility, which up to now has remained the last untreatable form of female infertility. ‘It also shows that transplants with a live donor are possible, including if the donor is past menopause.’ Dr Allan Pacey, chairman of the British Fertility Society, likened the operations to the first heart transplant. He added: ‘I think it is quite revolutionary. It feels like it did when IVF was developed or when the first heart transplant was done in the 1960s. ‘It is a bit of a game-changer. The question is can it be done repeatedly, reliably and safely.’ Dr Geeta Nargund, medical director of the Create fertility clinic in London, said: ‘This is a significant medical breakthrough and I congratulate the highly-skilled team behind it.’ However, she said the complexity of the surgery means it will be restricted to a few specialist hospitals.","The women have wombs transplanted by their own mothers .

"The father of a Massachusetts teen suspended after posting a photo of herself and her boyfriend in homecoming attire holding Airsoft rifles says the situation was 'blown out of proportion' by the school. Speaking for his daughter Jamie and her boyfriend Tito Velez, both 16, Jailes Pereira explained Wednesday that he understood the school's reasoning, but said the photo was an 'innocent mistake.' 'It was a totally innocent, stupid mistake that Tito made by putting the word ‘homecoming’ at the bottom of the photo and then posting it to Facebook,' Pereira told Fox News. Homecoming: Tito uploaded a photo to Facebook of himself and his girlfriend Jamie, both 16, holding Airsoft rifles and captioned it 'Homecoming 2014,' drawing ire from his school . Tito uploaded a photo Friday night of him and his girlfriend in formal wear holding Airsoft rifles, captioning it 'Homecoming 2014.' He said the couple wanted to 'do something unique and different' for their pre-homecoming photos. On Monday, classmates at Bristol-Plymouth Regional Technical School were talking about the photo, creating what Superintendent Richard Gross called a 'tumult.' 'These students know what is provocative,' Dr Richard Gross told CBS. 'To tie that to one of our school events kind of puts it over the top which brings us into it.' The photo coincided with a school shooting in Washington on Friday, when student gunman Jaylen Fryberg shot five friends, killing two, before turning the gun on himself. 'This isn’t dangerous, you can’t kill someone with it,' said Tito about the replica guns. 'We didn’t shoot anyone; we were pointing them at the floor.' Airsoft guns are nonlethal, though many are crafted to resemble actual firearms like an AR-15, and fire pellets made of plastic, rubber and other materials. Army: Tito plays with a team of Airsoft enthusiasts in a competition similar to paintball using nonlethal plastic or rubber ammo . Harmless: Tito said that the guns are not dangerous and noted he was pointing the gun at the floor in the photo he posted . Tito says he often competes on a team playing Airsoft, similar to a paintball competition. Pereira says he's meeting with Principal Carolyn Pearson about how Jamie will be punished. So far, the school has not decided on the the length of the teens' suspension. 'A slap on the wrist, maybe a day-long suspension or a warning would’ve been the right thing,' said Pereira.

A pirate play area in Carrington, Nottingham had to be closed  after parents found their children trying to pick up used needles and syringes in the sandpit . Yvonne Mutton, who took her four-year-old twin grandchildren to the play area, said: 'It's atrocious. What else can I say. It's disgusting that someone would leave that stuff in a park used by children. 'I usually think this is a nice play area but it's very worrying that it is being used for that sort of drug behaviour.'

Other drug paraphernalia was discovered in the park, including an opened wrapper for a sterile spoon . 'I've cycled past here a few times at around 6am in the morning and seen some suspicious people who looked like they were up to no good.' His wife Anna, 36, added: 'It makes me more conscious of coming back here and I will take more care to look out for these things. 'Children are inquisitive and will pick anything up, so it could be very dangerous.' Dave Halstead, head of neighbourhood operations for the authority, added: 'This is a park which is used and loved by many local families. 'Our staff service the park and this is the first time they have found evidence of any drug related activity. 'It is disappointing that someone has chosen to dispose of drugs equipment at a children's playground. 'A team was sent out as soon as we were notified and closed a section of the park before retrieving various items of drug paraphernalia and thoroughly cleaning the area.'","Needles and syringes were discarded at a sandpit in a children's play area .
