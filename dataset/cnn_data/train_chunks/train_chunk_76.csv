"London (CNN) -- The chief executive of British airport operator BAA, which is responsible for London's Heathrow, says he will not be taking his bonus for 2010 following the travel chaos caused by heavy snow. Colin Matthews told CNN: ""I am focusing 100% on passengers, we haven't got everyone home yet, there is still a backlog."" He refused to comment on the size of the bonus he has declined. ""I do not want to talk about my remuneration. I will be foregoing my bonus for the calendar year 2010,"" he said. When questioned about a rumored ""secret bonus"" based on profits, Matthews said: ""There is no secret bonus."" BAA would not discuss its bonus schemes but last year Matthews' salary and bonuses totalled Â£944,000 ($1.45 million), according to the British Press Association. Asked how Heathrow will respond to the crisis, he said: ""It is clear that we will need to buy new equipment... and purchase that as quickly as possible. What has caught us out is the intensity of the snow."" His comments came as tens of thousands of stranded passengers across Europe were finally starting their Christmas holidays Wednesday after airport and rail operators made the most of a clear weather spell and began addressing a huge backlog. Heathrow, the busiest airport in Europe and one of the hubs most affected by winter weather, opened its second runway Tuesday evening and said it was operating at between 70% and 80% of capacity Wednesday. However, around 400 flights have been canceled. Travelers were advised to check with their airlines before traveling to the airport. Malcolm Robertson, head of communications at BAA, told CNN: ""We're making progress... 100% of our infrastructure is clear and we're in a good position to increase the number of people we move."" Robertson said that he expected Heathrow to be fully open on Thursday and that the airport was ""as prepared as we can be"" for further predicted snow later this week. On Wednesday British Airways said that it would operate a ""full longhaul departure schedule"" on Thursday and Friday from Heathrow. Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, the second busiest airport in Europe, was also slowly returning to normal. However, forecasted snow on Wednesday forced an expected 15% reduction in flight schedules between 18:00 GMT and 23:00 GMT. Airlines were expected to cancel one-quarter of scheduled flights on Thursday at Charles de Gaulle, said the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. At Frankfurt, another major European hub, 1,400 flights were expected to operate Wednesday, according to Juergen Harrer, an airport spokesman. All three runways were open, although there were 70 flight cancellations due to other airports not being operational, he said. Harrer told CNN, ""There are still many passengers in the terminals but we are doing our best to get them to their destinations."" An official at Gatwick Airport, London, also warned of ""some knock-on delays and cancellations Wednesday,"" due to the ongoing impact of snow. Meanwhile, the long queues that had been winding down the street outside Eurostar's London rail terminal, St. Pancras International, had largely cleared on Wednesday. A Eurostar spokesman estimated around 500 people were queuing for check-in early Wednesday, far fewer than the thousands seen Tuesday. ""People seem to be respecting our advice not to come to the terminal unless they have a valid ticket for today, and not to arrive more than one hour before their train's departure. This is helping the terminal to get back to normal,"" Eurostar spokesman Leigh Calder said. Eurostar has stopped selling new tickets for travel before December 26 in an effort to get pre-booked passengers on trains in time for Christmas. ""We are confident we will get everyone with a valid ticket to their destination before Christmas Eve,"" Calder said. Eurostar was running at 80% of normal capacity, taking passengers across the Channel Tunnel to Paris and Brussels, Belgium. Nine trains have been canceled out of 52 scheduled services on Wednesday. Speed restrictions have been applied, so each journey is taking longer than usual and creating knock-on delays for other services. The UK's Met Office has issued weather warnings for parts of central England Wednesday but said it was not expecting further snow in London Wednesday and that Heathrow and Gatwick airports ""should remain dry.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. military has tried to close the security gaps that it believes allowed a low-level military intelligence analyst to steal hundreds of thousands of classified documents and ultimately give them to the WikiLeaks website. Since the first batch of documents was published earlier this year, military officials have warned that they need to balance the security and limited access with the need for troops around the world to be able to see the latest, raw intelligence. ""In the wake of this incident, it will be a real challenge to strike the right balance between security and providing our frontline troops the information they need,"" Defense Secretary Robert Gates said after WikiLeaks published a trove of documents about the war in Afghanistan. ""We want those soldiers in a forward operating base to have all the information they possibly can have that impacts on their own security but also being able to accomplish their mission."" After the WikiLeaks publications, Gates ordered two reviews of document security, according to Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman. As a result, stricter rules and more limiting technology has been used to help close the gaps while maintaining that balance, he said. ""Bottom line: It is now much more difficult for a determined actor to get access to and move information outside of authorized channels,"" Whitman wrote in an e-mail to reporters Sunday. In the short term, Whitman said, computers within the Department of Defense classified system have been disabled from any ability to record and download information ""as a temporary technical solution to mitigate the future risks of personnel moving classified data to unclassified systems."" The ability to access classified information was instituted in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks as a way to promote intra-agency cooperation. Known in the government as Net-Centric Diplomacy, the initiative is meant to give those on the front lines a full range of details from diplomatic and military communications. It is this system that Pfc. Bradley Manning is charged with exploiting to download documents and slip them to WikiLeaks. A U.S. soldier who served in Iraq, Manning has been charged with illegally transferring classified data onto his personal computer and adding unauthorized software to a classified computer system. The 22-year-old is suspected of having downloaded thousands of other documents from a server in Iraq. Manning is currently being held by the military in Quantico, Virginia, as he awaits trial. According to the charges against him, he was able to not only download documents for which he had clearance but was able to gain access to information that ""knowingly exceeded his authorization access."" The Defense Department also has restricted the number of systems where data can be moved from a classified computer to an unclassified computer, and now it takes two people in order to move data ""to ensure proper oversight and reduce chances of unauthorized release of classified material."" The Pentagon is developing methods to monitors suspicious behavior, ""similar to procedures now being used by credit card companies to detect and monitor fraud,"" Whitman explained. Still, there are some changes that have yet to be installed systemwide. A monitoring system to alert to unusual access of data is only overseeing 60 percent of the classified system, according to Whitman, although the installation of the monitoring system is being accelerated. The Pentagon also has increased training to make staff more aware of ""insider threat,"" Whitman said.","Document security reviewed after previous WikiLeaks disclosures .

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Extraordinary drama unfolded Tuesday in Port-au-Prince as charges were filed against former Haitian dictator Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier, government sources told CNN. It was not immediately clear what the charges were. A judge will have 30 days to investigate and decide whether the accusations merit moving forward with a case against Duvalier. Earlier in the day, the former leader was taken into custody at his hotel and transported to a downtown courthouse for a hearing. After hours of questioning, Duvalier was allowed to return to his hotel. A flurry of intense legal activity preceded Duvalier's emergence from the Karibe Hotel, where he had been since his mysterious return to Haiti on Sunday. His hands free of handcuffs, he made his way down three flights of stairs and waved to a small crowd of supporters before heavily armed police escorted him away in a waiting white van. Outside the hotel in the swanky suburb of Petionville, throngs of journalists had waited for Duvalier's appearance amid speculation that the former despot would be arrested. Several hundred people lined the downhill road from Petionville to downtown Port-au-Prince to show support. Some held photos of Duvalier when he was in his prime and banners. Duvalier shocked the world by returning to his homeland Sunday night after some 25 years of exile in France. He is accused of pillaging the country, siphoning money from Haiti's treasury into his family's pockets during his rule, which ended with a popular rebellion in 1986. Human rights groups have sounded a call for justice for atrocities committed during his 15 years of rule. Under Duvalier's presidency, thousands were killed and tortured, and hundreds of thousands of Haitians fled into exile, according to Human Rights Watch. Michele Montas, a Haitian journalist who has fought for democracy and is a former spokeswoman for the United Nations secretary-general, said Monday night that she plans to file a criminal complaint against Duvalier. ""We have enough proof. There are enough people who can testify. And what I will do is go to a public prosecutor, and there is a public prosecutor that could actually accommodate our complaints,"" she said on CNN's ""Parker Spitzer."" The United Nations said Tuesday that Duvalier's presence in Haiti had taken the global body by surprise and it ""clearly raises issues of impunity and accountability."" Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, said a range of human rights abuses and corruption issues surround Duvalier. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice told reporters Tuesday she hoped for a peaceful resolution to the tensions in Haiti. ""I think that it is clearly a tense and fragile time in Haiti, given the unresolved issues around the election, given the cholera epidemic, and it's certainly in the interests of the people of Haiti for there to be peaceful and cooperative efforts to resolve the outstanding issues related to the elections,"" she said. It's still unclear why Duvalier decided to go back to Haiti, and speculation is mounting over what he hopes to accomplish. His presence certainly added to a bubbling cauldron of political turmoil sparked by a presidential election mired in controversy. ""Obviously this is an important and crucial time for the people of Haiti,"" said White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs. ""Any political leader or any former political leader should focus not only on him or herself, but on making progress towards a set of important elections,"" Gibbs said, adding that such people should dedicate ""their time and their energy toward the reconstruction of the country."" Journalist Amy Wilentz, author of ""The Rainy Season: Haiti Since Duvalier,"" said the ""Baby Doc"" media circus was taking the focus off Haiti's leadership crisis. ""It's a giant sideshow to the electoral debate,"" she said. Preliminary results of the November 28 election placed former first lady Mirlande Manigat in a runoff with Jude Celestin, the candidate backed by Haiti's unpopular President Rene Preval. However, international monitors charged fraud and a subsequent election review put Celestin in third place. Observers suggested he be eliminated from contention. Preval's government has not officially commented on Duvalier's return, though some Haitians, craving a father figure to lead the nation out of crisis, have commented favorably on the old days of Duvalier. Back then, the streets were safe, said Port-au-Prince resident Jean Etienne. People could walk outside at night and food was cheap, he said. But Garry Pierre-Pierre, editor of the New York-based Haitian Times, blamed the father-son Duvalier dynasty for a nation struggling to regain footing. He said the scars still run deep from an era when no one trusted each other. Pierre-Pierre said he hopes justice will finally prevail. ""If there is a bright sport,"" he said, ""finally we have to face that decision that we have never faced straight up. We've been in denial about what happened during the 29-year reign of dictatorship of the Duvaliers."" Duvalier was supposed to have held a news conference Monday but it was canceled and he remained huddled inside the Karibe until he was taken away Tuesday. Henry Robert Sterlin, a Duvalier associate, told reporters that Duvalier returned because he was moved by the anniversary of last year's tragic earthquake and because he missed his native land. ""He's deeply hurt in his soul after the earthquake,"" Sterlin said. ""He wanted to come back to see how is the actual Haitian situation -- of the people and of the country."" Sterlin said he did not know how long the former leader had planned to stay. The Duvalier family ruled Haiti for three decades, starting in 1957 when Francois ""Papa Doc"" Duvalier was elected president. He later declared himself president for life. When he died in 1971, he was succeeded by his son, then only 19.

"(RollingStone.com) -- ""This echo is 'good,' "" Neil Young said toward the end of his set at Farm Aid's 25th annual concert, which drew 35,000 to Milwaukee's Miller Park. Playing songs like ""Down By the River"" and ""Ohio"" alone with an electric guitar and organ pedals he manipulated with his feet -- and occasionally joined by a harmonica and a choir featuring his wife, Pegi -- Young used the baseball dome's booming acoustics to his advantage, creating dissonant echoes and swirls of feedback with his snarling licks. Between songs he unleashed tirades about factory farms, estimating that over the last quarter-century hundreds of thousands of family farms have been displaced or overrun by factories. ""We're all hopeful,"" he said. ""That's why we're here. You can never give up. Never. Never. Never. So every year I get a chance to rant about it."" Appropriately, Young ended his set with the Seventies gem, ""Homegrown,"" joined by his fellow Farm Aid board members Dave Matthews and John Mellencamp, as well as Farm Aid's president, Willie Nelson. It was as close to an all-star jam as the night had to offer. Even Jeff Tweedy, who had played earlier, couldn't resist harmonizing from the visiting team's dugout, where he watched the rest of the show with his wife and two sons. Capping off the night was the eleven-hour concert's biggest surprise: Steven Tyler joining Willie Nelson on ""One Time Too Many"" and ""Once is Enough."" Farm Aid 25 Photos: Willie Nelson, John Mellencamp, Dave Matthews, Neil Young, Steven Tyler and more . The Farm Aid foursome -- Nelson, Young, Mellencamp and Matthews -- were joined by twelve other acts on Saturday at Miller Park, including Nelson's guitar-slinging son Lukas, who ran around the stage barefoot leading his band, the Promise of the Real, through blues incantations and rockers. ""I'm worried he's gonna break his legs jumping around like that,"" his dad told Rolling Stone that afternoon on his tour bus. Band of Horses followed with tunes from their latest, ""Infinite Arms."" ""I remember seeing the first Farm Aid on TV when I was seven,"" says BOH frontman Ben Bridwell, who played with Willie on ""Mama, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys,"" in Maui, in 2009. ""I mean, I've known about Farm Aid longer than I've been able to distinguish color, or do long division. I'm am never gonna forget this."" Photos: Front Row at the Hottest Live Shows . Many artists performed stripped-down sets. Country hellraiser Jamey Johnson played the classic ""I Saw the Light"" alone with an acoustic. The dreary day, with temperatures in the forties and steady rain coming down, caused organizers to close the dome's retractable roof, but the sun finally peeked through the windows when Jeff Tweedy hit the stage. With an acoustic guitar and harmonica rack, Tweedy ran through ""Out of Tune,"" ""I'll Go"" and ""I'm the Man Who Loves You,"" which he dedicated to his wife, Sue Miller. Matthews was joined by guitarist Tim Reynold for his half-hour set, culled mostly from his 2003 solo album, ""Some Devil,"" but featuring some Dave Matthews Band jams like ""Don't Drink the Water."" Nelson also sat in with them for a haunting ""Gravedigger."" Random Notes: Hot Rock Pics . Norah Jones, the only female on the bill, was warmly received. She alternated between guitar and piano, borrowing Young's upright, just as she did at last year's Bridge School Benefit. Jones, a bassist, and singer-strummer Sasha Dobson -- who nicknamed themselves the Rams, because they were all born Aries, in 1979 -- sauntered through ""Come Away With Me,"" Johnny Cash's ""Cry, Cry, Cry"" and ""How Many Times Have You Broken My Heart"" (the lyrics for which were written by Hank Williams.) Midway through Jones' set, Nelson pulled up to the stage in a golf cart to duet with her on ""Lonestar."" ""We're both Texans,"" she pointed out. (She also announced, at another point, that she was a farmer for Halloween last year.) Later Jones joined Tweedy in the visitor's dugout and celebrated the day with an organic hot dog. ""As the family farmer goes, so goes America,"" said Mellencamp, before tearing thorugh ""Pink Houses,"" ""Take Some Time To Dream,"" and ""Scarecrow,"" which he also performed at the inaugural Farm Aid, held in Illinois in 1985. Before his set, as he smoked American Spirits in his Airstream trailer outside the venue, Mellencamp reminisced about that first show. ""I remember seeing Bob Dylan and Tom Petty sitting on a step, smoking cigarettes,"" he said, smiling. After twenty-five annual shows, he says his most profound memory is of watching Elton John perform ""Candle in the Wind"" at the 1990 show in his homestate of Indiana. ""The day before, at Elton's request, I had visited Ryan White in his hospital,"" said Mellencamp, referring to the young boy suffering from AIDS to whom Elton had dedicated his performance. ""I was pretty choked up."" Earlier in the day, at a press conference held at Miller Park's adjacent little league field, Mellencamp said, not for the first time, that Nelson should be honored with a Nobel Peace Prize for his tireless devotion to American farmers. After all, Farm Aid is the longest-running musical cause ever. Willie, standing to Mellencamp's right, responded, ""How 'bout the No Bull prize?""

"(CNN) -- Manny Pacquiao's promoter plans to make another attempt to set up the long-awaited boxing showdown with Floyd Mayweather Junior. The Filipino became the first fighter to win world titles in eight divisions on Saturday night after claiming the vacant WBC super-welterweight belt from Antonio Margarito in a brutal bout that left his opponent needing facial surgery. The 31-year-old is running out of new opponents following two failed attempts to seal a deal to fight Mayweather, who is his main rival for the title of the world's best pound-for-pound boxer. Mayweather last fought in May, beating Shane Mosley, but has since been embroiled in domestic violence claims by his former girlfriend and faces criminal charges in court in January. Pacquiao wins eighth different belt . Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum told reporters after the Margarito fight in Arlington, Texas that his staff at the Top Rank organization would begin sounding out Mayweather about a fight next year. ""I will have Todd Duboef place a call directly to Floyd. Todd will ask one question and one question only, and that is whether Floyd wants to fight Manny,"" Arum said in quotes carried by sports website FanHouse. ""If Floyd's answer is yes about fighting Manny, then Todd will ask for Floyd's expressed permission to call his criminal lawyer. Todd will ask the lawyer if he can be sure if Floyd will be available, not on trial or otherwise occupied, on specific dates."" Margarito says sorry for Roach video . Mayweather is represented by Oscar De La Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions, but has been linked with legendary entrepreneur Don King. ""If Todd gets a good answer from the lawyer, then Todd calls Floyd directly one more time,"" Arum said. ""Todd will ask Floyd, 'Who is your chosen representative, who should we sit down with to put this fight together?'

"New York (CNN) -- Painting, simple painting is what caused Samten Dakpa to become a victim of terror. For painting classic Tibetan images as a teenager, Dakpa says, Chinese police -- intent on suppressing Tibetan culture -- arrested, beat and tortured him, shoving his hands into a coal-burning oven. ""It was like a barbecue,"" he said, describing the painful burns on his hands. Cheikhna Mahawa of Mauritania says he was arrested and tortured because he organized protests to improve education for the poor and lobbied for instruction of classic Arabic rather than the local Hassaniya dialect. Police, Mahawa says, shoved a rifle butt into his mouth, forced him to stare at the sun and beat him when he was unable to keep a cockroach within a small circle, using a stick. Aside from their victimization, what the two men share is a story of recovery made possible by the Bellevue Hospital Center-New York University program for survivors of torture, which provides care for victims from around the world, regardless of ability to pay. (http://www.survivorsoftorture.org/) ""The individuals who come to us are among the most traumatized and brutalized individuals there are,"" said Dr. Allen Keller, who founded the program in 1995. ""But they also come to us with incredible resilience, and we have the opportunity to help them heal."" Dakpa escaped from police custody, crossed the border into Nepal and then to India before finally arriving in the United States in 2003, a dozen years after his torture. ""When Sampten first came to us, he was in excruciating pain, both physically and emotionally. He could barely use his hands,"" Keller said. ""He would try to paint and he could barely hold a paint brush. When he did he would get terrifying memories of the torture he endured."" Doctors operated on Dakpa's right hand, allowing him to hold a paint brush without pain for the first time in years. His left hand, badly scarred, still has limited mobility. ""Just these two fingers are stuck here and I cannot open more than this,"" Dakpa said as he tried to stretch his palm. ""Middle finger, if I try to open strongly, it hurts a lot."" So, this spring, surgeons plans to operate on the left hand. Dakpa said he had nightmares in which he was being chased along an icy river. The ice would crack and he would fall into the freezing water. Therapists helped him deal with the trauma and today, Dakpa said, he hardly has any nightmares. Mahawa has received treatment for his jaw and persistent back pain as well as psychological counseling. But, the Bellevue-NYU program does more than provide medical care. It connects patients with free legal assistance. Many, like Dakpa and Mahawa, are able to gain asylum status. Social workers also aid with English lessons, connections for employment and housing. The Survivors of Torture program, in a cramped, somewhat decrepit corridor of Bellevue Hospital, is like a international refugee center. On a recent morning, a patient from Cameroon was reunited with her two daughters, who had just arrived in the United States. Other patients patiently waited in the hallway to meet with therapists and social workers. During its 15 years, the program has treated nearly 3,000 survivors, Keller said. ""We're able to help them heal, help them to function and get on with their lives, and that's really gratifying."" Samten Dakpa is delighted and grateful to earn a living creating art -- without pain. (http://www.samdak.com) ""I'm feeling really relaxed when I paint. It's very meditational,"" said the torture survivor. Cheikhna Mahawa, meanwhile, feels victory over his former captors, as he teaches calculus and linear algebra at City College of New York while he pursues a doctorate there. ""Absolutely. Without a doubt,"" Mahawa said when asked if it's worth fighting for education, even to the point of becoming a victim of torture. ""What is living without wisdom?"" he asks. ""What is living without knowledge?""","Samten Dakpa says he was tortured for painting classic Tibetan images .

"New York (CNN) -- A former aide to Bernard Madoff, who faces charges related to Madoff's massive Ponzi scheme, appeared Friday in U.S. District Court for a pretrial hearing. Annette Bongiorno, 62, along with co-defendants George Perez, Daniel Bonventre and Joann Crupi, went before U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain to address concerns about the right to a speedy trial. Bongiorno's attorney, Roland Riopelle, said his client remains under detention at her Manhasset home on New York's Long Island with all of her assets restrained. He added, however, that there has been a ""very preliminary discussion with the government to work things out."" Swain reduced Bongiorno's bail to $3 million from $5 million a week ago. The charges against Bongiorno include conspiracy and tax evasion. Bongiorno turned herself in to the U.S. Marshals Service in Florida in December after a federal judge in New York rejected her bail, according to U.S. Marshals Deputy Wayne Pickering. Bongiorno had been approved for bail, but Swain later revoked that right over concerns of flight risk, given that she has access to millions of dollars, according to court documents. She is said to have managed investment accounts for some of Madoff's largest and most important customers, including Carl Shapiro, Stanley Chais and Jeffry Picower, said Madoff's secretary, Eleanor Squillari. ""(Bongiorno) was running the accounts for the favored clients,"" Squillari said. ""She really was the head of her department in the investment advisory part of the business."" The government previously filed civil complaints against Bongiorno and Crupi, both longtime Madoff employees who were supervisors of his ""back office"" staff. The suits are intended to retrieve millions of dollars in assets -- including homes and luxury cars -- that the two allegedly received while involved in Madoff's scheme. In December, Madoff's son, Mark Madoff, committed suicide in his Manhattan apartment two years to the day after his father was arrested for swindling $50 billion from investors in the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. Bernard Madoff pleaded guilty in 2009 and was sentenced to 150 years in prison.

"(CNN)  -- Roberto Mancini believes Carlos Tevez should apologize to Manchester City fans after the Argentina star changed his mind and decided to stay at Eastlands. Tevez stunned the City faithful when he said he wanted to leave the English Premier League side, citing personal issues. It led to a stand off with Mancini, which was resolved when Tevez had a change of heart, although doubts remain about his long-term future with the club. The saga was reminiscent of Wayne Rooney's situation at city rivals Manchester United, where the England star said he wanted to leave before a very public climb down and apology. Football's heroes and villains of 2010 . Now Mancini is advising Tevez to take a similar course of action. ""I don't know. Maybe he should apologize,"" Mancini told the official Manchester City website. Despite the furore, Tevez retained the captain's armband for the 2-1 home defeat to Everton on Monday. The shock loss was a setback to City's title challenge and Mancini added: . ""It is important now that Carlos plays well and scores goals. ""But the fans still love him."" Ahead of City's Boxing Day trip to Newcastle, Mancini had more words of advice for his summer signing Mario Balotelli. The striker has won plaudits for his goalscoring ability, but Mancini wants him to show more battling qualities. ""You must also put your heart and your strength on the pitch, he said. ""I know a lot of players, good players like Mario, who did not play football in a top team because of this."" Mancini is set to recall controversial midfielder Nigel de Jong to his side for the trip to St James' Park. The Dutchman has just served a one-game ban after picking up five bookings, but it was his challenge on Newcastle's Hatem Ben Arfa in the home match in October which gained notoriety, although it went unpunished by referee Martin Atkinson. Ben Arfu was left with a broken leg, but Mancini said the controversy would not affect his selection.

Cassano has not played a competitive match since falling out with Sampdoria, although the club recently failed to get the player's contract cancelled at an arbitration panel. Although Cassano cannot officially sign for Milan until next month, he can join his new team at their winter training camp in Dubai from December 27. Rafa Benitez's old tricks backfire in Italy . Neither club has confirmed the deal yet, but Italian media reported that Cassano's contract will run until 2014 and that a â¬5 million sell-on clause due to his former Spanish team Real Madrid will now be divided between Milan, Sampdoria and the player. Despite his undoubted ability, Cassano has proved a controversial figure during his career with Bari, Roma and Real, and has made only 20 appearances for Italy in seven years. However, with Filippo Inzaghi ruled out for the season with a knee injury, Cassano was quickly identified by Milan as a replacement for the veteran striker. Cassano joins an already star-studded attack which includes Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Alexandre Pato, Robinho and Ronaldinho, with speculation already mounting about the latter Brazilian's future following his failure to command a regular place at the San Siro this season.","AC Milan poised to sign Antonio Cassano after reaching a deal with Sampdoria .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The United Nations Security Council decided Tuesday to postpone for a day a vote to approve sending 2,000 additional troops to the Ivory Coast. Security Council diplomats said the vote was delayed because Russia had objections to the ""political"" language in the draft resolution. ""[Wednesday], we will adopt the resolution,"" Ambassador Ivan Barbalic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, this month's president of the council, told reporters. Asked whether disagreements between member states led to the delay, Barbalic said ""There are no disagreements. It will be adopted."" The Security Council is expected to approve the increase unanimously, a diplomat from one of the council's member states told CNN on Monday. U.N. officials requested up to 2,000 more peacekeepers in early January, which would bring mission strength to more than 11,000 troops and police. The increased number of troops comes amid a standoff between self-proclaimed President Laurent Gbagbo and the internationally recognized winner of November's presidential runoff, Alassane Ouattara. Ouattara is holed up in a hotel in Abidjan under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers, and the United Nations has blamed Gbagbo's supporters for a string of attacks on U.N. vehicles and troops in the past week. Gbagbo's foreign minister, Alcide Djedje, said earlier this month that the peacekeepers are ""complicit with the rebellion"" and that the sitting government has ""no more confidence in the U.N."" The standoff has raised fears of a renewal of the bloodshed suffered after a civil war broke out in 2002. More than 25,000 Ivorians have fled to neighboring Liberia since the crisis began, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reported last week. The Economic Community of West African States has threatened to use ""legitimate force"" to remove Gbagbo, who met Monday with African Union mediator Raila Odinga. Odinga, Kenya's prime minister, arrived in Abidjan for the talks early Monday. The cocoa-producing nation was wracked by civil war from 2002 to 2007, when a settlement left the country divided between north and south. The 2010 elections came with high expectations that they would open a new chapter in the country's history.

"(CNN)  -- Nikolay Davydenko made a winning start in his defense of the Qatar Open title with a 6-1 6-4 victory over Italy's Fabio Fognini on Monday. Davydenko is fourth seed at prestigious ATP Tour season-opener where the star attractions are the world's top two players Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, who begin their campaigns later in the week. The Russian, hoping to return to top form after injury blighted his 2010 season, needed just over an hour to dispatch Fognini. He beat two-time Doha champion Federer and Spain's Nadal on the way to the title last season. But the statistics point to a Federer or Nadal triumph come Saturday. They have been the top two seeds in 66 tournaments, with one or other going on to win the title on 44 occasions. Third seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga was also a straight sets winner on his debut at the $1.024 million tournament. The Frenchman blasted 10 aces as he breezed past Ruben Ramirez Hidalgo 6-2 6-0. Tsonga only dropped eight points on service and converted five of nine break point opportunities to open his 2011 account in some style. Seventh seed Guillermo Garcia-Lopez of Spain began proceedings with a 6-1 7-6 win over Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan in just over 90 minutes. In the Chennai Open, there was a shock defeat for reigning champion Marin Cilic of Croatia. Cilic was upset by Japan's Kei Nishikori 4-6 7-6 6-2 in the first round as he bid for a hat-trick of titles at the Indian tournament.","Nikolay Davydenko beats Fabio Fognini 6-1 6-4 to begin Qatar Open title defense .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Rafael Nadal set up a semifinal showdown with Andy Murray after winning his third successive match at the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London on Friday. The Spaniard overcame sixth seed Tomas Berdych 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 to repeat his victory over the Czech in the Wimbledon final in July. Third seed Novak Djokovic will play No. 2 Roger Federer in Saturday evening's second semifinal after handing American Andy Roddick his third successive defeat in Friday's closing match of the round-robin stage. The 24-year-old, who needed to win just one set to progress, completed his seventh straight win over Berdych despite losing his cool with an umpiring call. Nadal was infuriated when Berdych was allowed to challenge a decision in the 12th game and was given the point as his backhand was shown to touch the line and not be long. Nadal calmed himself down after a long, heated exchange with the umpire and held serve before winning the tie-break comfortably and then racing away with the second set to reach the last four of the event for the first time. Behind the scenes at the ATP Finals . ""It was a very important victory because every day I'm playing a little better and today I played a great match. It's going to be a really, really difficult match against Andy,"" he told the crowd after ending Berdych's hopes of progressing. Nadal has never won an indoor hardcourt tournament, and failed to win a set at the O2 Arena last year. He has beaten Murray eight times in their 12 meetings, but lost to the British player on hardcourt in Toronto in August and retired hurt on the same surface during their Australian Open last-16 clash in January. Nadal won their first two hardcourt meetings in 2007 but they went 2-2 last year. In Friday's final Group A match, Djokovic needed to win only one set to earn a clash with Group B winner Federer. Roddick, who lost his first two games, needed to win in straight sets to go through as runner-up. He had won his past four encounters with Djokovic, three of them being two-setters. But it was the Serbian who prevailed with the minimum of fuss, winning 6-2 6-3 as he suffered none of the contact lens problems that hampered him in his earlier defeat by Nadal. ""It's definitely a great achievement to get to the semifinals. It's great for the tournament to have the top four guys in the semifinals,"" the 23-year-old, who walked out to the court wearing a joke eye patch, told the crowd afterwards.","Rafael Nadal defeats Tomas Berdych to reach semifinals and eliminate the Czech .

"(CNN) -- Lleyton Hewitt hopes his first experience of playing at the Australian Open's former venue in Kooyong will stand him in good stead for his 15th consecutive appearance at the season's first grand slam next week. The 29-year-old Australian won the Kooyong Classic exhibition event, beating France's Gael Monfils 7-5 6-3 in the final on Saturday for his third win of the week. His home major tournament moved from the suburbs to central-city Melbourne Park in 1988, and his career began as precocious teenager almost a decade later. Former world No. 1 Hewitt, a two-time grand slam champion and a losing Australian Open finalist in 2005, will be unseeded after slipping to 54th in the rankings following an injury-hit 2010. Should the Australian Open be moved to February? He decided against entering the official ATP season-opening events in Brisbane and Sydney, instead playing at the mixed teams Hopman Cup event in Perth and then Kooyong. Hewitt beat top Russian duo Mikhail Youzhny and Nikolay Davydenko before meeting Monfils, and feels ready for his opening match in Melbourne against former No. 3 David Nalbandian -- who lost to Spanish top seed David Ferrer in the final of New Zealand's Auckland Open on Saturday. It will be the feature match of the opening round, a rematch of the duo's 2002 Wimbledon final and 2005 Australian Open quarterfinal, both won by Hewitt. ""I felt pretty comfortable this week and only time will tell over the next couple of weeks if it was the perfect preparation,"" he told the ATP website. ""But at the moment I'm extremely excited about winning three tough matches. 'I've done everything possible and feel like my game is where I wanted it to be 10 weeks ago, and physically I feel good. ""Ten weeks ago when I sat down with Rochey (his coach Tony Roche, a former French Open winner who has also worked with tennis greats Ivan Lendl, Pete Sampras and Roger Federer) and talked about what we wanted to work on and get out of that training block. I think we've been able to do that, so we've done the best preparation possible."" Australian Open: From nomad to nouveau riche . World No. 7 Ferrer regained the hardcourt title he first won back in 2007 as he defeated Nalbandian 6-3 6-2. He ended a three-match losing run against Nalbandian, who is seeded 27th in Melbourne, ahead of his opening match against Finland's Jarkko Nieminen. At the Sydney Invitational, Gilles Simon became the first Frenchman to win the men's title in 20 years as he beat Serbian fourth seed Viktor Troicki 7-5 7-6 (7-4) in just under two hours. Troicki, seeded 29th in Melbourne, will take on Russia's Dmitry Tursunov in his opening match while Simon plays Taiwan's 35th-ranked Yen-Hsun Lu.

"(CNN) -- Kenny Dalglish last managed a football club more than a decade ago, and he was given a stark reminder of how much the game has changed since then as Manchester United spoiled his return to the hotseat at Liverpool on Sunday. The 59-year-old, known as ""King Kenny"" by the English club's fans after winning eight league titles and three European crowns as player and then manager, saw Liverpool beaten 1-0 in his first match in charge, an FA Cup third-round tie at Old Trafford. The club's arch-rivals United scored a second-minute penalty through Ryan Giggs after Daniel Agger made a small amount of contact with Dimitar Berbatov, then influential captain Steven Gerrard was sent off after half an hour for a two-footed challenge on Michael Carrick. Dalglish, a dour Scot used to the physical demands of 1970s and '80s football, ruefully reflected on the decisions of referee Howard Webb, who officiated at the 2010 World Cup final in July. ""The penalty is a joke. I have seen the replay and unless they have changed the rules, it is no penalty,"" he told reporters following his first match as a manager since leaving Scottish club Celtic in 2000. Did Liverpool make the right decision? ""The other one, I cannot see that as a red card either. In the dressing-room before the game, someone said to me the game's not changed that much. I said 'I thought it was a non-contact sport.' Maybe I was right."" Dalglish's next task following his appointment to the end of this season as replacement for Roy Hodgson is to prepare Liverpool for Wednesday's Premier League trip to Blackpool, with the club 12th in the table just four points above the bottom three. Liverpool lost at home to the unfancied promoted club in October under Hodgson before new American owners New England Sports Ventures bought out Tom Hicks and George Gillett. Liverpool appoint legend Dalglish . Dalglish's first Liverpool reign ended in February 1991 when he resigned after a 4-4 draw with city rivals Everton, who will visit Anfield next Sunday. United won through to the fourth round of England's historic knockout competition, with a trip to third division Southampton on January 29 or 30. Manager Alex Ferguson expects England striker Wayne Rooney to be ready to return from an ankle injury well before then. ""Wayne came out for training on Friday and we thought he would make today,"" he told reporters. ""But he just felt it again. At that point, we said no. There was no point."" The Premier League leaders hope to have Serbia defender Nemanja Vidic back against Tottenham on Sunday. Meanwhile, Chelsea also progressed to the fourth round of the FA Cup with a  thumping 7-0 win over managerless second division club Ipswich on Sunday. The two-time defending champions lifted the pressure on their own boss Carlo Ancelotti with their biggest victory since 1908 as young forward Daniel Sturridge and England midfielder Frank Lampard both scored twice and French striker Nicolas Anelka netted his first goal in two months. The London side went into the match in the worst run of league form since owner Roman Abramovich took over in 2003, but had few problems in setting up a clash with Everton as they seek to become the first team since the 1880s to win the cup three times in a row. Ipswich, who sacked former Manchester United star and Sunderland manager Roy Keane on Friday, suffered the worst defeat in the club's 132-year history -- surpassing the 6-1 reverse to West Ham in August. Manchester City face an FA Cup replay after the club's former manager Sven Eriksson led second division Leicester to a 2-2 home draw. Leicester took the lead after just 50 seconds as new defender Sol Bamba scored from close range following a corner, but Premier League high-flyers hit back through James Milner and captain Carlos Tevez to lead at halftime. However, Leicester drew level in the 64th minute through Andy King after England goalkeeper Joe Hart spilled a cross from Paul Gallagher to keep alive the club's hopes of a fourth-round tie with third division Notts County -- shock victors against Sunderland on Saturday. Tottenham, who announced earlier in the day that David Beckham's proposed loan move had been called off, will make the short trip to London rivals Fulham following a 3-0 victory at home to third division Charlton. Spurs' 19-year-old midfielder Andros Townsend opened the scoring, then England striker Jermain Defoe netted twice against his former club.","Ten-man Liverpool lose 1-0 to Manchester United in third round of FA Cup .

"(CNN) -- World No. 2 Roger Federer will seek to win just his third title this year when he takes on German Florian Mayer in Sunday's final of the Stockholm Open. The top seed, playing the Swedish event for the first time since his debut there 10 years ago, was tested for the second match in a row as he overcame Ivan Ljubicic 7-6 (7-5) 6-2 in Saturday's semifinals. Federer, who was taken to three sets by fellow Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka on Friday, faced again losing the opener but broke the Croatian fourth seed's serve at 5-4 down. The 29-year-old then won five successive games from 2-1 down in the second set to give himself a chance of adding to his 2010 Australian Open and Cincinnati Masters crowns and 63 career titles. ""I'd love to win, I've never won a title in Sweden. That would be something special. But it's good to win one in any case. It's a good feeling to walk off court as a winner,"" the 16-time Grand Slam champion told reporters. Federer lost to Andy Murray in the final of his last event, the Shanghai Masters, and has only been successful in two of six title matches this year for a 51-12 winning record overall. ""I've had an amazing run in the past winning 24 straight finals. Maybe this can be the start of another streak,"" he said. Mayer, who has lost both previous meetings with Federer, is seeking his first ATP Tour title following final losses in 2005 and 2006. The world No. 47 followed up his surprise quarterfinal victory over second seed Robin Soderling with a hard-fought 4-6 6-4 7-6 (7-3) win against Finland's Jarkko Nieminen on Saturday. ""I have nothing to lose. I was a little tired today, physically and mentally,"" said the 27-year-old, who saved a match-point at 5-4 down in the final set before winning the tie-break. Meanwhile, Soderling will join Federer, Murray, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic in the end-of-season ATP World Tour Finals in London next month despite his defeat. The Swede, a semifinalist in the season-ending event last year, has qualified for the fifth of eight places due to the schedule of draws made on Saturday for next week's tournaments in Vienna, St. Petersburg and Montpellier. Last year's Stockholm champion Marcos Baghdatis reached the final of the Kremlin Cup on Saturday with a 6-4 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (7-2) win over Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin. The fourth-seeded Cypriot will face Viktor Troicki on Sunday after the Serbian world No. 43 earlier beat Uruguay's Pablo Cuevas 6-3 6-3 to reach the third final of his career, having lost his previous two. In the women's event in Moscow, second seed Victoria Azarenka reached her fourth final of the year with a 6-3 6-3 win over Spanish No. 8 Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez. The 21-year-old world No. 6 will take on sixth seed Maria Kirilenko, who thrashed fellow Russian Vera Dushevina 6-1 6-1. In the WTA Tour's Luxembourg Open, German eighth seed Julia Gorges will face Italy's Roberta Vinci in Sunday's final.

"(CNN) -- Former world number one Ana Ivanovic says she is determined to get back to the top of tennis following her morale-boosting title success in Austria. The 22-year-old ended her two-year trophy drought on Sunday, moving up to 26th in the rankings after beating Patty Schnyder in the final of the event in Linz. ""I think I deserve a position at the top and I think I have the ability to win another grand slam,"" the 2008 French Open champion told CNN on Monday. ""I am very keen to get back there, and I am putting everything into it. I really want it to happen soon."" The Serbian had slumped as low as 65th in the WTA standings this year, but said her ninth career title was evidence that she was on the way back up. ""I feel great,"" she said. ""It really means a lot for me because I have put a lot of hard work in. I'm thrilled to have finally won a title again."" After claiming the prestigious number one ranking back in 2008 -- the same year she won her one and only grand slam title to date in Paris -- Ivanovic found herself quickly slipping outside of the world's top 20. Critics were quick to blame a lack of focus, claiming she had been distracted by off-court matters as she signed some lucrative endorsement deals and was courted by media enchanted by her good looks. But the Belgrade-born athlete denies any claims that her slump was due to a problem with motivation or a declining interest in the sport she began playing at the age of five. ""Once I became number one I started working even harder. I changed my technique but injuries started creeping in -- it was a big mistake as I was doing something right to get to that spot in the first place,"" she said. ""I had a few little injuries and then I lost matches I should have won. It affects your confidence -- it's like a circle that is hard to break."" Ivanovic's previous WTA Tour victory had been on the same Austrian hard-courts at her peak in 2008, and she now hopes Sunday's breakthrough can be the catalyst to further success in her still-young career. ""I am working very hard. I know it's going to be a process, but I am ready to give it my all and come back to the top,"" said Ivanovic, who is seeded fourth for this week's Luxembourg Open.","Ana Ivanovic won her first tennis title in two years in Linz, Austria on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Serbia and France are tied at 1-1 after the first day of the Davis Cup final after sharing the opening singles rubbers in Belgrade. Gael Monfils put France ahead with an emphatic 6-1 7-6 6-0 win over Janko Tipsarevic before Novak Djokovic brushed aside Gilles Simon 6-3 6-1 7-5 to level for the hosts. Djokovic hit a blistering 62 winners for his sixth win out of six in singles ties for Serbia this year as they bid for their first Davis Cup title. The world number three was always in command against Simon, who had been handed the second French singles berth in the place of the injured Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and to the roars of the capacity home crowd won in two hours 18 minutes. ""Definitely it's an advantage for the home team playing in front of their people. To be able to have this support is really relevant,"" Djokovic told the official Davis Cup website..

"(CNN) -- A trial for nine terror suspects accused of having ties to al Qaeda opened in a Belgian court Monday, with the main defendant suspected of nearly launching a terror attack just hours before a 2008 European Union summit in Brussels. That defendant, Malika el Aroud, and her husband, Moez Garsallaoui, are charged with heading a terrorist cell linked to al Qaeda and running a Web site that glorified suicide bombings and urged young Muslims to sacrifice themselves in jihad, or holy war. The couple has long enjoyed a notorious reputation among European counterterrorism services. El Aroud's previous husband, Abdessattar Dahmane, had assassinated Ahmed Shah Massoud, the head of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, in a suicide bombing ordered by Osama bin Laden two days before the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. When CNN interviewed the couple in 2006, el Aroud showed how she administered a pro-al Qaeda Web forum called Minbar SOS, which included pro-al Qaeda postings and propaganda videos. Belgian investigators say the Web site played an important role in the radicalization of members of the French-Belgian group. The Belgian-Moroccan woman was considered an ""al Qaeda living legend"" upon her arrest on December 11, 2008, as leaders of the European Union's 27 member states arrived in Brussels for the summit. Fourteen people were arrested early that morning in one of the largest counterterrorism operations in Belgian history. Six eventually were charged with participation in a terrorist group. The others were released. At the time, officials told CNN that the alleged cell had connections to a senior al Qaeda operative who helped orchestrate the 2006 ""Airline Plot,"" widely recognized as al Qaeda's most serious terror attempt since 9/11. A senior counterterrorism source with detailed knowledge of the investigation said the alleged cell was connected to the top ranks of al Qaeda through Garsallaoui, a Tunisian Islamist militant who left Belgium for the tribal areas of Pakistan in late 2007. According to Belgian counterterrorism officials, Garsallaoui, a Tunisian citizen, relied heavily on the Internet to recruit members to the group. The other defendants are Belgian citizens: Hicham Beyayo, Ali El Ghanouti, Yussuf Said Harrizi, Hicham Bouhali Zrioul, Jean Trefois, Abdullazziz Bastin, and Mohammed Bastin. Garsallaoui, who has yet to be captured, and Zrioul, who has fled on bail, will be tried in absentia. Defense lawyer Christophe Marchand said the trial is scheduled to take place four days a week, from Monday to March 26. A ruling is expected toward the end of April. The use of the Internet by the suspected al Qaeda cell was instrumental in getting approval recently for a law that will give state security agents power to monitor Internet usage. The law will take effect at the end of the year. While the country's intelligence services previously had some of the weakest Internet laws at its disposal, it now has some of the strongest regulations in the world. ""One of the people involved in the case in Belgium -- I'd rather not name her -- is coming forward as someone who is seeking to defend jihad ideology by what's on the Internet,"" Alain Winants, the head of Belgian intelligence, told CNN in a recent interview. ""I think that a lot of individuals in these cases -- and Bryant Neal Vinas, too -- have been wrapped up by radicalization on Internet site."" Vinas, a native of New York, pleaded pleaded guilty in January 2009 to charges of aiding al Qaeda and helping attack a U.S. military base in Afghanistan. Authorities accused Vinas of firing rockets at the base along with others in September 2008, and of providing al Qaeda with information about the New York transit system and the Long Island Railroad. Vinas, 27, was arrested in Pakistan late in 2008 and is awaiting sentencing. He told investigators that about the time he became an al Qaeda member, he came across several Belgian and French militants. He said he met in Waziristan in northwest Pakistan with at least three members of this group, including Garsallaoui and Zrioul, a Belgian-Moroccan who once worked as a taxi driver in Brussels. In June 2008, Garsallaoui wrote an e-mail to his wife, intercepted by U.S. counterterrorism agencies, in which he claimed to have killed several Americans in Afghanistan, according to Belgian legal documents. However, Garsallaoui's list of enemies does not seem to have been limited to U.S. troops in Afghanistan. On May 11, 2009, he issued this threat to Belgium authorities on his wife's Web site: ""If you thought that you could pressure me to slow down through the arrest of my wife, you were wrong. It won't stop me fulfilling my objectives. ... The place of my wife in my heart and the heart of all the mujahedeen is greater than ever. ... Surprises are sure to be in store for you in the days ahead. Those who laugh last, laugh more."" CNN's Nic Robertson and Paul Cruickshank contributed to this report.","Trial begins in Belgium for nine people accused of having ties to al Qaeda .

"(CNN) -- China's Li Na recovered from 5-0 down in the opening set to defeat third seed Kim Clijsters 7-6 6-3 in the final of the Sydney International tournament on Friday. World number three Clijsters looked destined to power through the first set, after taking just 19 minutes to open up her advantage, only for eighth seed Li to fight back to eventually win it 7-3 in the tie-break. Clijsters, 27, had won four of her previous five meetings with Li, but the world number 11 secured the second set to win her first WTA Tour title since June 2010. ""She's definitely a player who has every quality to win a grand slam,"" Clijsters said of her opponent, a semifinalist at last year's Australian Open, on the WTA's website. ""She's a contender who probably isn't being focused on enough. Mentally she maybe gets a little bit nervous in big matches, but she can beat any top player out there when she's playing her best."" U.S. Open champion Clijsters would have moved up to second in the world rankings with a win, and the Belgian admitted she was not on top form at Sydney Olympic Park.

Despite his win, fourth seed Troicki explained how he had struggled with the weather conditions. The Australian Open should be in February! ""I would say the match was pretty bad,"" the world number 30 told the tournament's website. ""It was quite windy. We were both struggling with our games.

"(CNN) -- Formula One's new tire provider Pirelli has simulated rainfall in the desert to test its wet-weather products ahead of the 2011 season. The Italian company, which returns to the elite motorsport after a 20-year absence as official supplier in place of Bridgestone, coated the Yas Marina circuit in Abu Dhabi in water for the unprecedented two-night session. Pedro de la Rosa, who raced for Sauber last year, was at the wheel for the final test on Tuesday. The 39-year-old Spaniard drove a Toyota TF109, the last car made by the Japanese manufacturer before it exited Formula One in 2009. The tests, which took place between 6 p.m. and midnight local time, were designed to investigate how the tires handled hot and cold tarmac. ""We decided to do it this way because we want to challenge our rain tires with the most difficult and demanding of all situations,"" Pirelli's F1 team director Paul Hembery told the company's website on Monday. ""And who knows, perhaps it could be a good idea for a future grand prix? These tests will provide us with useful information to finalize our tire development process for Formula One. ""It is seven months since we started developing our tires and five since we started with the actual testing. We are very satisfied with the results so far."" De la Rosa took part in 14 races with Sauber last year before being replaced by Nick Heidfeld after the Italian Grand Prix in September. Heidfeld, De la Rosa and former Renault driver Romain Grosjean have been testing Pirelli's range of tires over a period of nine sessions, from wet and intermediate rubber to super-soft and soft compounds. The Yas Marina circuit has been the setting for the final grand prix of the racing calendar since 2009, and was the scene of Sebastian Vettel's maiden world championship triumph last November. The 12 Formula One teams set to compete in the 2011 season should be present for the first official pre-season test in Valencia, Spain on February 1.","Pirelli has been testing its wet-weather tires for the 2011 season in Abu Dhabi .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer aims to bounce back from his crushing final defeat in Shanghai as he enters his final four tournaments of 2010 with a long-awaited return to Sweden this week. The 16-time Grand Slam winner moved back to second in the world rankings above Novak Djokovic despite being thrashed in straight sets by Andy Murray on Sunday. He will open his campaign at the Stockholm Open on Thursday against American Taylor Dent in his first appearance at the ATP Tour event since 2010, having pulled out two years ago with a back injury. The indoor hardcourt tournament is run by the Swiss star's former on-court rivals Thomas Johansson and Jonas Bjorkman. ""Physically I'm feeling good, and mentally I have a lot left in me. I don't feel like it's the end of the year. I intend to make it fun for myself,"" Federer told the ATP Tour website. ""It's a combination of factors behind a decision like this. I love playing tennis and love playing tournaments, and haven't played here in 10 years. ""I was supposed to have played here two years ago, but had a bad back. I thought it would be fun to come back to Stockholm, and the fact that Thomas and Jonas are in charge makes it extra special."" Federer has won just two titles this year, the Australian Open and the Cincinnati Masters, but told reporters on Tuesday that he is determined to win back his No. 1 ranking from Rafael Nadal -- who has moved well clear at the top after his Wimbledon and U.S. Open victories. Federer will try to reduce the deficit in Stockholm, his home event in Basle, Paris and then London at the ATP Tour World Finals. ""For me there is number one and everything else. It's not too important for me to be two, three or four,"" he said in quotes carried by AFP. ""I'm always trying to get back to number one, it's what I'm concentrating on week by week."" Dent moved into the second round on Tuesday when Poland's Michael Przysiezny retired with an injury, having lost the first set 6-2. Spanish sixth seed Feliciano Lopez was upset 6-2 6-2 by Germany's Florent Mayer, while his eighth-seeded compatriot Tommy Robredo crashed out with a 6-3 6-2 defeat by Croatian qualifier Ivan Dodig. Unseeded German Benjamin Becker beat young Dutchman Thomas Schoorel 6-3 6-0 to set up a second-round clash with second-seeded home hope Robin Soderling, runner-up in 2003 and 2008. At the Kremlin Cup in Russia, Radek Stepanek was the only seeded men's player in action on Tuesday and the Czech No. 5 overcame Romania's Victor Hanescu 7-6 (7-5) 6-3. In the women's event, Chinese third seed Li Na was knocked out by 2006 champion Anna Chakvetadze in her opening match, having been given a wildcard entry. The 23-year-old Russian, who has fallen to 68th in the rankings after a career-high fifth in 2007, set up a clash with the Ukraine's Mariya Koryttseva following her 6-4 6-2 victory.

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal will face Roger Federer in Sunday's final ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena in London. Federer dispatched semi-final opponent Novak Djokovic in straight sets 6-1 6-4 on Saturday evening, while Rafael Nadal beat a determined Andy Murray 7-6 (7-5) 3-6 7-6 (8-6) in the first semi-final earlier in the day. Federer was in ruthless form in the opening set, holding his opening service game to love and then wasted no time breaking the Serb's serve in the next. Djokovic managed to open his account in the fourth game, but there was no stopping the World No.2 after that as he secured a double break in the sixth, before polishing off the set with trademark efficiency. The Serb started the second set more promisingly, holding his opening two service games and breaking Federer in between to establish a 3-0 lead. But Federer broke back in the fifth to restore parity, and broke again in the ninth with a series of wonderful forehand winners, before holding serve to win the set and the match. Tennis aces feel like rock stars . Earlier in the day, World No.1 Nadal narrowly overcame Britain's Andy Murray in an epic three setter 7-6 (7-5) 3-6 7-6 (8-6). Despite a spirited display, Murray's pre-match pessimism earlier in the week turned out to be well-founded, as the Spaniard eventually prevailed in a grueling encounter. Murray produced his best tennis of the week and there was little to choose between the two men in the first set as they traded some thumping forehands. But there were few alarms on serve as the set progressed and a tiebreak was the inevitable conclusion. Nadal secured the first mini-break to go 3-1 up and soon extended his lead to 5-2. But Murray fought back, winning the next three points to level up at 5-5. But a miscued running forehand by the Scot handed Nadal his first set point which he seized, attacking Murray's serve before delivering a deft drop volley. The first six games of the second set went with serve, but in the seventh Murray earned himself three break points. Nadal managed to save them all, but an over-hit return at deuce handed Murray a fourth opportunity which, this time, he secured with a crosscourt backhand winner. Murray held his next service game to lead 5-3 and when Nadal faltered again on his serve Murray took full advantage and ensured -- to the delight of a rapt crowd at the O2 Arena -- that the match would go to a deciding third set. Nadal started it the stronger, breaking Murray in the third game and looked as if he would close out the set and the match comfortably. But Murray claimed the 10th game to level the scores at five games apiece as the match headed towards a deciding tiebreak. Murray had the better of the early exchanges and opened up a 4-1 lead only for Nadal to level things up at 4-4. The Spaniard then seized the initiative which saw him close out the tiebreak 8-6 and take the match to set up a 22nd meeting with Federer. Nadal has an impressive 14-7 head-to-head record against the 16-time Grand Slam champion, according to atpworldtour.com. Their last meeting was on clay at ATP Masters event in Spain earlier this year, where Nadal won in straight sets and in their last ten meetings the Spaniard has prevailed seven times. But it's currently honors even in their hard court meetings with each player having won on three occasions.","Rafael Nadal overcomes spirited Andy Murray to book place in ATP World Tour final .

"(CNN) -- German driver Nick Heidfeld has replaced Pedro de la Rosa at Formula One team Sauber for the rest of the season. The 33-year-old, who drove for Sauber from 2001-03 and again from 2006-09, will take over from the Spaniard for the next race in Singapore and the four following races. ""I'm looking forward like crazy to having the opportunity to go racing again in a good car in Formula One from the Singapore Grand Prix onwards,"" said Heidfeld in a statement on the Sauber website. ""After the last months I'm even more motivated than ever. For me it is like coming home, as I raced for seven years in total for the team from Hinwil."" Heidfeld began the season at Mercedes as a test driver for Michael Schumacher and Nico Rosberg before leaving to work with tire manufacturer Pirelli. De la Rosa has been dropped after only managing to score six points so far this season. Sauber's other driver, Japan's Kamui Kobayashi, has 21 points. ""I am surprised by the team's decision, but I respect it and would like to wish everyone good luck for the remainder of the season,"" said De la Rosa, who vowed to continue in the sport next season. Heidfeld has posted 12 podium finishes in 167 Grand Prix since making his debut with the Prost team in 2000.

"(CNN) -- Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo has promised that the Italian Formula One team will not make major changes for 2011 despite this year's title disappointment, and he tipped Felipe Massa to return to form. Massa played very much a secondary role on his return to driving following his horror accident in July last year, and had to watch as new teammate Fernando Alonso was denied his third drivers' crown on the last day of the season. Ferrari were criticized for the tactical decision to have Alonso follow Red Bull's Mark Webber into the pits early on in Abu Dhabi, which consequently helped the Australian's teammate Sebastian Vettel claim the race victory and his first world title. However, Montezemolo backed Ferrari to bounce back next year with both drivers at the helm. ""That is the strength of Ferrari, in that we never give up,"" he told the Ferrari website. ""Having been in Formula One for such a long time, this was certainly not the first time I have lost a world championship at the final race. Ferrari 'astonished' by politician's rant . ""Changes within the team? That is not our philosophy, because for years now we have adopted a policy based on dynamic stability: a few minor adjustments are possible, but no major upheaval. ""Alonso was amazing, both on and off the track: determined and full of self-belief, a real driving force. I expect a lot from Felipe next year: I am sure he will return to being the man we saw in 2008."" The Brazilian driver, who was denied the drivers' title by Lewis Hamilton at the final race two years ago, played down suggestions that he was battling for his future at Ferrari. ""I don't think 2011 signifies a crucial year for me. Fundamentally, I have been in this situation often,"" he told the team's website. Massa impressed with new Pirelli tires . ""I remember that at the start of 2006, many people said I would only last a year at Ferrari and then I won races that season and went on to stay for a long time more. ""This year, there were many who said I would have a difficult year after my accident in Budapest: it turned out that way, but not for that reason. Over the years, the names of at least 10 drivers have been put forward as replacements for me at Ferrari, but I am still here!"" Montezemolo also backed team principal Stefano Domenicali as the Scuderia seek to adapt to technical changes in 2011 and add to the marque's 15 drivers' titles and 16 constructors' crowns. ""I am very happy with the work with which Stefano Domenicali is moving us forward, with great ability, spirit and a sense of balance,"" the 63-year-old said. ""For 2011 there will be various technical changes, from the return of KERS to the arrival of Pirelli tires and an adjustable rear wing. ""We are starting from a solid base. I'm thinking here of the fact that at the end of last year, our energy recovery system was very competitive. As for the rear wing, I hope we start the season with total clarity as regards the regulations. I am not worried about it, but our experience of 2009 still grates."" Montezemolo revealed that 2011 will also be a big year for Ferrari both on and off the racetrack. ""We are finalizing the details for our first showroom in India, we are strengthening our position in China and the United States. In Formula One terms, we have very clear targets,"" he said. ""There is a great will to fight back and be ready for next season, when our aim is to have a car that, right from the start, is capable of winning so that we don't have to play catch-up.""","Ferrari boss plans to keep Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa as the team's drivers .

"(CNN) -- Williams driver Nico Hulkenberg took advantage of changeable weather conditions to secure a remarkable first-ever pole position for Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix, stunning all the Formula One title favorites in the process. Hulkenberg mastered the change in the weather, which saw the rain ease up in final qualifying -- prompting drivers to switch from intermediate to slick tires -- to give Williams their first pole position since the European Grand Prix at the Nurburgring in May 2005. The 23-year-old German has the four drivers battling it out for ther world title breathing down his neck. The Red Bull duo of Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber are second and third on the grid, with McLaren's Lewis Hamilton fourth and world championship leader Fernando Alonso in fifth position.

Hulkenberg could not contain his joy, telling reporters: ""It's amazing. I still can't believe I've done it. ""To go on slicks was the right decision. I squeezed everything out of my car, so I'm very, very happy. I'm just enjoying the moment. ""My first pole is so emotional. I'm just lost for words.

"(CNN) -- Red Bull Formula One driver Mark Webber has revealed in his newly-published autobiography that he drove the final four races of last season with a broken shoulder. The Australian, who was in contention to win his first world championship right up to the final race in Abu Dhabi, sustained the fracture in a mountain bike accident prior to the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka in early October. And despite needing pain-killing injections ahead of the Japanese and Korean Grands Prix, Webber decided to keep the injury secret from Red Bull principal Christian Horner. In the book, entitled 'Webber up front', the 34-year-old wrote: ""I was riding with a great friend of mine. Suddenly, he crashed right in front of me and I had nowhere to go but straight through the handlebars. ""I suffered what they call a skier's fracture to my right shoulder,"" he added. Webber, who went on to finish second behind teammate and eventual world champion Sebastian Vettel in Japan, continued: ""Suzuka is a brutal track so it was a blessing that the Japanese weather gave me an enforced rest day on the Saturday when qualifying was rained off. ""A pre-race cortisone injection helped me too and, in the end, we got through the weekend all right,"" he added. Although Webber has not blamed the shoulder injury for failing to lift the world title, his fortunes faded over the final three races. He failed to finish in Korea and his second place in Brazil meant he went into the final race in Abu Dhabi behind Fernando Alonso in the title chase.","Mark Webber reveals he drove the final four races of last season with a broken shoulder .

"(CNN) -- This weekend's inaugural Korean Grand Prix is a step into the unknown for Formula One, but Red Bull's title hopefuls Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel are looking forward to the challenge as the 2010 season heads into its final three races. Vettel led the Austrian team to a 1-2 in Japan two weeks ago, leaving him tied for second overall with Ferrari's Fernando Alonso 14 points behind Webber. The Yeongam circuit in South Korea was finally cleared by F1 officials last week, despite rules stating a new venue should be completed 90 days before a race is due to take place, and the drivers are keen to see a track that most have experienced only in simulators and video footage. ""It looks like a nice layout in terms of the track, we are all optimistic to go there and have a good run and I am looking forward to it,"" Webber told the Red Bull website. Vettel added: ""I am pretty excited about South Korea: it's a new race track, which means none of us have been there before. While I know the race will take place, I can't really say anything about the track itself until Friday."" Korean GP gets green light from FIA . The duo will be taking tips from Karun Chandhok, a driver for Hispania Racing who carried out a test run in a Red Bull show event there in September. ""The track's got a good mix of corners and I think we'll see a lot of overtaking in the first sector -- there are long straights into slow hairpins,"" he told the Red Bull website. ""The straight after turn one and two is really long, so we may see some good slipstreaming there, like in Shanghai. From turn seven onwards, there's a fast section of flowing corners all the way back to the start-finish line, so I think the Red Bull Racing guys will be happy in sectors two and three. It's an interesting layout and the location's nice, overlooking the sea."" Latest F1 championship standings . The 3.5-mile (5.6-kilometer) Korean International Circuit was built on marshland on the South Korean coast and is the work of German Hermann Tilke, who has also designed F1 venues in Abu Dhabi, Malaysia, China, Bahrain, Singapore and Spain among others. It will be the center of a new urban development, sited in an area popular with tourists about five hours' drive from the capital Seoul. McLaren's Lewis Hamilton, who trails Webber by 28 points, is also looking forward to the race as he seeks to regain the world title he won in 2008. ""I've driven the Korean International Circuit on the simulator, and my first impressions were extremely positive,"" the British driver told the official F1 website. ""On paper, the track should suit our car quite well -- the first sector is all about good end-of-straight speeds and strong performance under heavy braking, both key characteristics of our car. ""And the middle sector is fast and flowing -- it's the kind of place where you want a car with a good balance and good downforce. I think it'll reward commitment, it actually feels like quite a nice driver's track."" Vettel wins in Japan as Webber extends lead . His teammate Jenson Button, who is fifth overall, has also been impressed with the circuit. ""There appear to be a couple of very likely opportunities for overtaking, particularly at the end of the three main straights, but possibly also off-line in the twisty final sector,"" the defending world champion said. ""The track looks quite high-speed, and the walls are close, so I think it'll be an interesting challenge."" Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher believes the drivers will be able to adapt to the new track. ""Finally this year we are going to a circuit which is not only new for me but for all of the drivers. Korea will be a very interesting country to see and even if the track has only just been finished in time, I am confident that everything will be fine,"" the Mercedes veteran said. ""I am very much in favor of new races and I think it is a benefit for all of us in the sport. It should not be too complicated to learn the layout and we are used to adapting quickly to new circumstances.""","The first Korean Grand Prix takes place this weekend at the new circuit in Yeongam .

"(CNN)  -- Martin Kaymer increased his lead in the Race to Dubai with a superlative final round of 66 at St.Andrews to claim a three-shot victory in the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship on Sunday. The German birdied the final two holes at the home of golf to hold off a determined challenge by England's Danny Willett as he finished on 17-under 271. But there was disappointment for Lee Westwood who needed a top two finish to immediately dislodge Tiger Woods as world number one, but struggled to a one-over 73 for a tie for 11th. Westwood, who has been struggling with a recurrence of a calf injury, then confirmed he will not play again until the end of the month at the latest. But due to a quirk of the rankings, it could mean the Englishman will take over at the top in three weeks' time unless Woods changes his plans and enters a tournament before next month's HSBC Champions in China. ""It's just got more aggravated and achy as the week has gone on,"" Westwood told Sky Sports after his round. Kaymer, who claimed his first major title with victory at the PGA Championship, was winning his third straight tournament and again showed his cool under pressure. With Willett challenging, Kaymer needed to get down in two from just off the green at the famous 17th Road Hole to stay at 15 under. But he proceeded to hole his putt to suddenly open up a two-shot lead and despite finding a tricky lie on the road at the 18th hit his approach to within 10 feet.

"(CNN) -- Former Williams rookie Nico Hulkenberg believes that the Force India team could be his best chance of driving in the 2011 Formula One championship. The German lost his race seat after being unable to earn a new contract, despite an impressive end to his debut season. Williams instead opted to sign 25-year-old Venezuelan driver Pastor Maldonado to drive alongside Brazilian veteran Rubens Barrichello ahead of the new season starting in March. ""Force India is our best shot, but it is also no secret that quite a few drivers are trying to land a seat there. We are talking to them and let's wait and see what develops,"" the 23-year-old told the official F1 website. Maldonado earns F1 drive at Williams . Force India, Toro Rosso, Virgin, Hispania Racing and Renault have yet to confirm their line-ups for 2011. Hulkenberg finished the season a point above Force India's 15th-placed Vitantonio Liuzzi in the overall standings, but 25 below the British-based team's 11th-placed Adrian Sutil. ""The hope is still there and I am not giving up,"" he said. ""We are working very hard to get a deal done, but there are not many good race seats left."" Hulkenberg snatched pole position for Williams at the penultimate grand prix of 2010 in Brazil in November, but the driver said he knew this would not be enough for him to stay with the British team. ""One lap does not change the course of history. There had been signs before that there was something brewing, because the team repeatedly delayed contract talks. So I was forewarned that something was going on."" Rookie Hulkenberg leaves Williams . And Hulkenberg believes that drivers will no longer be able to count on just their ability in securing team spots, with sponsorship being an equally important factor in the economic climate. ""The team has not done too well over the last couple of years -- if you cannot produce that performance you eventually have to look for other ways to close the budget gap,"" he said. ""It has become much harder to open doors if your application does not come with a serious sponsor package and you really only rely on your talent  This is quite frustrating and somewhat sad."" Nevertheless, Hulkenberg remains upbeat about the sport he joined just over a year ago -- and confident about the future, however uncertain it might be. ""I would have liked to stay with them,"" he said of his former employers. ""Being teamed up with Rubens Barrichello -- he is a great guy and still a great driver. I really enjoyed working with him.

A first half goal from Colombian David Ferreira was added to in the second period by strikes from 23-year-old George John and Honduran Marvin Chavez to give Dallas the win, a result which ended Galaxy's hopes of winning a third MLS cup. ""It's just disappointing we've gone out the way we've gone out,"" Beckham told the league's official website. ""[In the] first two minutes, I pulled my abductor. It wore off a little, but obviously had nothing to do with our loss."" Former U.S. national team coach Arena admitted he was aware of the injury and had considered substituting the 35-year-old, but he decided against it and went on to praise the attitude of his star player. ""We saw in the very beginning of the game probably 15 minutes in, he had a problem. He hung in there,"" said Arena. ""If we have all of our players with his kind of character and commitment, we would continue to do well."" Team-captain Landon Donovan revealed the former Real Madrid midfielder has been playing through the pain barrier for sometime. ""He hasn't been at full strength since he's been back. When you come back that quickly at that age from an Achilles injury, there are going to be residual effects. ""My hat's off to him. He played through a lot of pain those last few weeks, more than you guys know, but he's a competitor and he wants to keep going."" Beckham's earlier ankle injury destroyed his dreams of playing for England in the 2010 World Cup, but he has played the full 90 minutes in four of Los Angeles' last five games since his return to the team. Dallas will now compete in the final championship game -- the decider for the MLS title -- against Colorado Rapids, who beat San Jose Earthquakes 1-0 in the Eastern Conference final thanks to a goal from Kosuke Kimura. The last game of the MLS season will take place on November 21 at Toronto's BMO Field.","David Beckham picked up a groin strain in the MLS Western Conference final on Sunday .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor's right leg was amputated Friday because of a large, deep lesion that proved resistant to antibiotics, her surgeon said. ""She seemed to tolerate it well, although she's in a somewhat frail condition,"" Dr. David Rigberg said. Doctors have been treating Gabor, 93, at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for two weeks without success, leading to Friday's amputation of her right leg above the knee, Rigberg said. ""We're guarded in our opinion on how she's going to do overall,"" Rigberg said.""She didn't come in from home in very good health, so it's difficult for me to predict how long she's going to be here."" Husband Prince Frederic Von Anhalt said he did not tell Gabor she was being taken to surgery for an amputation. ""Eventually, she will feel it, and then she will ask me and at that moment I don't even want to think about it,"" he said. Gabor's only child, daughter Francesca Hilton, complained that doctors had been ordered by Von Anhalt not to talk to her or let her see her mother. Hilton has maintained a strained relationship with Von Anhalt, Gabor's ninth and current husband of 23 years. In November, Gabor was hospitalized for a swollen leg, her husband said at the time. Paramedics initially suspected Gabor suffered from a blood clot in her left leg, but an emergency room doctor at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center later determined she had an infection, according to Von Anhalt. Gabor has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident, Von Anhalt has said. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. She had hip replacement surgery last year after she suffered a fall in her home. The Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders.","Gabor's right leg was amputated above the knee .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The judge overseeing the Mel Gibson child custody case ordered a probe into the leak of sealed court documents published on celebrity news website TMZ, a lawyer in the case said. The confidential documents ""were stolen probably from the court"" and the leaker ""got paid a good deal of money,"" said Martin Garbus, an attorney for Gibson's ex-girlfriend, Oksana Grigorieva. Grigorieva and Garbus discussed the leaks in an interview scheduled to air Wednesday night on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""It's medical documents, declarations, court opinions, transcripts, everything it seems,"" Garbus told King. TMZ has published sworn statements from Gibson, Grigorieva and another witness in the court fight over custody of 1-year-old Lucia. ""They say over 2,000 pages of documents were leaked and the district attorney's office has started an investigation,"" Garbus said. A spokewoman for the Los Angeles district attorney said Tuesday that she was not aware of an investigation. TMZ's spokeswoman declined to comment on the report of the investigation or the source of the documents. Lawyers involved in the case had copies, but Garbus suggested the leaked papers likely ""came out of the courthouse."" ""Whoever took the files from the courthouse -- it's 2,000 pages -- certainly got paid a good deal of money,"" Garbus said. The judge ordered the probe on Friday, Garbus said. A lawyer for Gibson declined to comment, but a publicist for Grigorieva said the leaks did not come from her side. ""It could be quite terrible because this case could turn into a gossip story, and swayed from what's important here,"" Grigorieva said. ""It's domestic violence and Lucia at stake."" She has accused Gibson of domestic violence during their breakup earlier this year, while he accused her of extorting him with tapes she secretly made of their arguments. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is investigating both accusations. In another development, Grigorieva's family lawyer, Alan Shifman, stepped aside and has been replaced by Los Angeles attorney Ronald Litz, her publicist confirmed. Gibson and Grigorieva are both scheduled to return to court on Monday.","NEW: TMZ declines to comment on documents' source .

"(CNN) -- My every-other-month dinner-and-discussion group met the other night. After a plentiful potluck meal, we got down to the topic designated for the evening: ""If you could solve any issue or problem in your lifetime, what would it be?"" Less than two weeks after the election, most of the issues raised were political, ranging from redistricting reform to civility in the political process. When it was my turn, I offered up a different fare: ending childhood hunger in the United States. (In truth, I'd like to see peace in the Middle East, but thought I'd be reasonable.) The government estimates that as many as 17 million children face ""food insecurity"" (aka hunger). ""Poverty does devastating things to children,"" said Andy Mullins Jr., co-director of the Mississippi Teacher Corps and associate professor of leadership and counselor education at the University of Mississippi. Teachers will tell you that children who come to school hungry have more difficulty learning. And if education is key to breaking out of poverty, these children are at a disadvantage. Around Thanksgiving -- amid advertising images of tables laden with food -- you can expect the news media to focus attention on those for whom feeding themselves or their families is difficult. In this economy -- one showing the barest hints of a recovery -- more and more people find themselves in this situation. Consider these examples from around the country: . The Community Food Pantry in Merrill, Wisconsin, has distributed 12 percent more food this year than last, according to Denis McCarthy, pantry manager. Mary Louise Verkest, executive assistant for the Hope pantry, said that as the group prepares for the winter it needs residents to come forward with food drives and donations. ""We would not be able to provide the resources and support to the community without the community,"" she said. Texas food banks distributed nearly 43 million pounds of food in the second quarter of 2010, 14 percent more than in the same period last year. Nearly 11 percent more Texans lived in poverty last year than the year before, including more than one of every four under age 18. ""If these numbers don't convey a sense of urgency, I don't know what will,"" said J.C. Dwyer, state policy director of the Texas Food Bank Network. In Libertyville, Illinois, there are people who go to the township pantry on Tuesdays and to the pantry at the St. Joseph's Church Formation Center on Mondays and Thursdays. ""It's very practical, because whatever food we give them won't last more than a few days,"" said Jim King at First Presbyterian Church, which operates a monthly pantry. ""I think people are stretched,"" social worker Linda Blatnik said. ""Their unemployment is running out. More seniors aren't getting an increase in their Social Security."" In Gila County, Arizona, ""Just about everyone is out of money and out of food,"" said Su Hubenthal, with the Payson St. Vincent de Paul Food Bank. Local food banks eked through last winter and an increase in poverty and families losing their health insurance has compounded the problems. Last year, demand at the food bank jumped by about 50 percent and it hasn't declined since, said Hubenthal. ""It just hasn't gone down."" One in six people in the Tampa Bay area of Florida received some form of emergency food assistance in 2009, up 27 percent from 2006. The 627 area nonprofits that provide food aid are feeling a strain. ""It's been a real eye opener into how quickly we're losing ground,"" said Pat Rogers, director of Feeding America Tampa Bay, a food bank serving pantries and social service agencies. In a survey conducted for the Hormel Foods Corp. by Opinion Research Corp. (which also is CNN's polling partner) more than one-quarter of those responding said that in the past year they or someone they know had to choose between providing food for their family or paying their bills. One in 10 said they personally went to bed hungry at least once in the past year. ""It is disheartening to see most Americans feel the hunger problem in the U.S. will not be solved in the next 20 years,"" Jean Kinsey, a professor emeritus of applied economics at the University of Minnesota and director emeritus of The Food Industry Center, said in a release accompanying the study. That's not an encouraging outlook. What can you do? Volunteer at a local food bank or pantry. Personal involvement will help you understand the magnitude of the problem and you'll feel like you're doing your part to help. Donate money or food items. Individual contributions are as important as those from big charities and grocery chains. And as you enjoy your Thanksgiving meal, remember that not everyone will sit down to a table laden with food and give thanks for their good fortune. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Schechter.","The government estimates 17 million U.S. children face hunger .
Community food pantries need more donations to meet winter needs .
Food relief programs are distributing more food this year than last year .
Most Americans don't think the hunger problem will be solved in 20 years ."
"(CNN) -- Manchester United returned to the top of English Premier League with a 5-0 crushing of crisis club Portsmouth on Saturday, while Liverpool kept their Champions League bid on track with a 1-0 victory in the derby against Everton. United went one point clear of Chelsea, who host third-placed Arsenal on Sunday, and Liverpool climbed into fourth despite having a man sent off. Sixth-placed Manchester City could have joined Liverpool on 44 points but suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at Hull City, who moved out of the relegation zone. Tottenham were unable to reclaim fourth place after being held 0-0 at home by fellow European hopefuls Aston Villa in the late match. Portsmouth's season went from bad to worse at Old Trafford to end a week that saw Hong Kong-based businessman Balram Chainrai become the club's fourth owner in six months ahead of a winding-up hearing due to tax debts next Wednesday. England striker Wayne Rooney put United ahead in the 40th minute with his 23rd league goal this season with a header from Darren Fletcher's cross, then Nani's close-range effort was deflected off Anthony Vanden Borre, who was credited with an own-goal, onto goalkeeper David James and into the net just before halftime. It was 3-0 after 59 minutes as Portsmouth's Richard Hughes deflected a shot by Michael Carrick past James, then United striker Dimitar Berbatov fired in a low effort three minutes later. The visitors then conceded a third own-goal in the 69th minute as Mark Wilson diverted Patrice Evra's cross into his own net to leave Portsmouth six points adrift of second-bottom Wolverhampton Wanderers, who play Midlands rivals Birmingham on Sunday. Liverpool played for 55 minutes with 10 men against Everton after Greek defender Sotirios Kyrgiakos was sent off for a two-footed tackle on Marouane Fellaini, but claimed a vital home victory thanks to Dirk Kuyt's 50th goal for the Merseyside club. The Dutch striker headed home Steven Gerrard's corner from close range in the 55th minute, and Everton struggled to break down their rivals' determined defense before also being reduced to 10 men when South Africa midfielder Steven Pienaar received his second booking in time added on. Manchester City welcomed back England defender Wayne Bridge for his first outing in two months following injury -- and also since tabloid revelations which on Friday saw Chelsea's John Terry stripped of the national captaincy due to an alleged affair he had with his ex-teammate's former partner. But it was Hull, who drew 1-1 with Chelsea on Tuesday, who took the lead in the 31st minute when Jozy Altidore scored his first league goal. The United States striker, whose relatives were affected by the Haiti earthquake, curled in a fine shot after a layoff by fellow frontman Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink, whose fellow Dutchman George Boateng made it 2-0 nine minutes after halftime with a 25-yard volley from half-cleared corner. Roberto Mancini's City pulled one back five minutes when Emmanuel Adebayor scored from close range after a corner by Stephen Ireland, but the visitors could not equalize despite bringing on new signing Patrick Vieira for his debut. Tottenham could not find a way past Aston Villa's veteran American goalkeeper Brad Friedel, who pulled off a string of fine saves. The hosts appealed in vain for a late penalty when midweek hat-trick hero Jermain Defoe was brought down by Villa midfielder Stiliyan Petrov, then his strike partner Peter Crouch missed with a back-heeled attempt from close range in time added on. Fulham consolidated 10th place with a 0-0 draw at Bolton, who were left a point above the relegation zone after having a late header by captain Kevin Davies ruled out for a push on Brede Hangeland. Stoke leapfrogged Blackburn into 11th place with a crushing 3-0 win over the visitors in manager Tony Pulis's 300th match in charge of the club. Goals from full-back Danny Higginbotham and striker Mamady Sidibe made it 2-0 at halftime, then Blackburn defender Christopher Samba was sent off for a second yellow card before Matthew Etherington wrapped up victory on 67 minutes. The match was marred by the news that a man, reportedly a Blackburn fan, was taken to hospital in a critical condition with a head injury after being found unconscious at the start of the second half. Police are investigating the matter. Sunderland remained 13th after coming from behind to draw 1-1 with Wigan, who led through Mohamed Diame before Kenywne Jones headed home on 64 to give manager Steve Bruce a point against his former club. Sunderland, however, have not won in 11 games while Wigan -- knocked out of the FA Cup by fourth division Notts County in midweek -- are just two points above the drop zone. Burnley moved out of the bottom three with a 2-1 win at home to fellow strugglers West Ham to give manager Brian Laws his first victory since taking charge and the club's first in 13 league outings. Loan striker David Nugent opened the scoring before debutant defender Danny Fox doubled the lead, while substitute Ilan pulled one back for West Ham late on after fellow new signing Mido hit the post.","Manchester United return to top of English Premier League with 5-0 crushing of Portsmouth .

"Tampa, Florida (CNN) -- A campaign aide to Florida gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink has been removed after the Democratic nominee was sent a text message during a televised debate -- in violation of the rules that the candidates agreed to. Sink's campaign did not name the advisor. But a campaign spokesman confirmed it was Brian May, who signed the rules agreement before the Monday evening debate. The incident took place at the CNN/St. Petersburg Times Florida gubernatorial debate when Sink's make-up artist delivered a two-sentence message on a cell phone during a break. Republican nominee Rick Scott, who was sitting next to Sink in the nationally televised debate, noticed the violation and notified a CNN official. The CNN official approached the make-up artist and Sink, and confiscated the cell phone. The message read: ""The attorney who [w]on the Sykes suit said alex sink did nothing wrong. Tell not to let him keep talking about her."" After the debate, the Sink campaign released a statement from the candidate announcing that the advisor who sent the message has been removed from the campaign. ""After the debate tonight, one of my campaign advisors admitted he tried to communicate with me during one of the breaks,"" Sink said. ""While he told me it was out of anger with Rick Scott's repeated distortion of facts, it was a foolish thing to do. It violated a debate agreement and I immediately removed him from the campaign. "" Earlier in the day, officials with both campaigns signed a statement that agreed, among other things, that no notes would be allowed. ""There will be no opening and closing statements, no notes and no props on stage,"" read the statement. ""Candidates will be provided water, notepad and pen."" CNN did not allow campaign aides to accompany the candidates backstage, but Sink and Scott were permitted to use their own make-up artists during the debate. On the air after the commercial break, Scott pointed out the breach. ""First Alex, you say you always follow the rules,"" he said. ""The rule was no one was supposed to give us messages during the break, and your campaign did with an iPad or an iPod."" For the record, the device Sink read from was neither an iPad nor an iPhone but a Droid smartphone.","During a break, Sink is shown a text message from an aide .

"(CNN)  -- A disastrous blunder by England goalkeeper Robert Green cost his side victory as they drew 1-1 with the United States in their Group C opener in Rustenburg on Saturday night. England were leading 1-0 through a fourth minute Steven Gerrard goal approaching halftime when Clint Dempsey sent in a weak shot from just outside the penalty area. Maradona's Argentina beat Nigeria . It appeared to be a routine save for Green but astonishingly he let the ball slip through his grasp and despite a despairing dive saw it trickle into the net. England captain Gerrard gave his side a dream start after he latched on to a neat pass from Emile Heskey to beat Tim Howard in the U.S. goal with ease. Fabio Capello's men were holding onto their lead comfortably enough, aside from a scare when Jozy Altidore connected with a Landon Donovan cross to send his header wide, until the fortunate 40th minute equalizer. The second half saw England press for the winner and Heskey was sent clear by Aaron Lennon but shot straight at Howard. Wayne Rooney also sent a shot narrowly wide and cleverly set up substitute Shaun Wright-Phillips for a chance from the left side of the penalty area which he sent straight at Howard. But English hearts were in their mouths as Altidore outpaced Jamie Carragher, who came on for the injured Ledley King at halftime, and bore down on goal. This time Green came to the rescue, parrying his effort against the post to partially redeem himself for an error which will live long in the memory. There was no masking the disappointment in the England camp at the final whistle. Catch up with CNN's twitter.buzz . ""The idea tonight was to win the game, but unfortunately we have let a poor goal in and we couldn't go on and get the winner,"" Gerrard told ITV Sport. ""The target now has got to be seven points."" England's next game is against Algeria in Cape Town on Friday with the United States taking on Slovenia in Johannesburg. Capello would not confirm if he will stand by Green for a game which now takes on added significance. ""Sometimes a forward misses a goal and sometimes the keeper makes a mistake, this is football. The second half he played very well,"" said the Italian.","England and United States draw 1-1 in their Group C opener in Rustenburg .

"(CNN) -- An American relief worker jailed in Haiti under suspicion of kidnapping a 15-month-old boy has been released, the man told CNN Wednesday. ""As soon as they said I was being released I was at first shocked and couldn't believe it because it was already dark and normally nothing happens after sun goes down around there,"" Paul Waggoner, who had been held since mid-December in Port-au-Prince, said in an interview. Waggoner was being transported Wednesday to a safe location to receive medical attention, according to a statement from Materials Management Relief Corps, a group that he co-founded. ""Waggoner spent 18 harrowing days incarcerated in Haiti, accused of kidnapping a child despite undeniable evidence that the child in question had died at Haitian Community Hospital last February,"" the group said in a statement. ""No charges were brought against Waggoner... even though he was held in the notoriously dangerous penitentiary for two weeks,"" the statement said. Waggoner had been held in the National Penitentiary in Port-au-Prince. Interviewed by phone from an undisclosed location on Wednesday, Waggoner said a judge had found ""contradictions"" in statements from the boy's father. Waggoner said the boy's parents had been trying to extort him and that ""it was a matter of a father and a mother trying to make a dime off of their kid."" A Haitian judge had concluded that sufficient evidence existed to hold Waggoner while investigators evaluated the father's complaint that the American kidnapped his critically-ill son from a hospital, according to Jon Piechowski, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Haiti. The Materials Management Relief Corps is a humanitarian organization that seeks to provide logistical support to medical workers in Haiti, where a major earthquake caused extensive damage in January. According to the group's website, Waggoner lives in Nantucket, Massachusetts. Waggoner was working at the Haitian Community Hospital in Petionville in February when a Haitian man sought treatment for his 15-month-old son. Accounts differ as to what happened next, but the father believes the child survived and that Waggoner kidnapped him, according to Piechowski. Waggoner's supporters, including two physicians, have said the child died, and that his body was cremated because the father would not claim the remains. Dr. Kenneth Adams, a volunteer physician on staff at the Haitian Community Hospital, said he was present when the child's father returned to see his son and ""witnessed as the father looked at the baby for several minutes, waiting for the baby to breathe."" The man took pictures with the deceased baby before he left, Adams said. The father filed a complaint against Waggoner in March. Piechowski said Waggoner left Haiti without answering the accusations and was arrested December 12 after returning to the country. One account provided by supporters says the father handed Waggoner the child at the hospital. Another says Waggoner may have transported the child to the hospital. Regardless, Waggoner had nothing to do with the child's care, according to his supporters. ""I was there through the whole thing, and what kills me is that Paul basically had nothing to do with the whole situation,"" said Jeff Quinlan, who said he was working as director of security at the hospital when the child arrived. Quinlan said he told the father that the boy had died and instructed him to return within 24 hours to take the body. But he said the father instead returned with a ""witch doctor"" claiming the child was still alive. Quinlan and Waggoner's organization said a doctor who treated the boy has signed an affidavit confirming that the child died, saying that the father had viewed the body and that he had declined to claim the remains because he did not have resources to bury the child. Quinlan said earlier that he believed Haitian authorities were trying to extort money from Waggoner. A friend of Waggoner's recently expressed concern that the relief worker would face danger upon being released. ""I think the biggest concern I've got for his safety once he's out of prison,"" said Paul Sebring, a fellow aid worker, ""is that, you know, people surrounding this case may not be happy with the ruling that's happened and may come after him in some sense."" But Waggoner said Wednesday that he hopes to do more aid work in Haiti. ""I wouldn't say that anybody needs to have second thoughts about coming down here,"" he said. ""If any aid workers want to do work in Haiti they should absolutely do it. The people here absolutely need it."" The United States was keeping close watch on the case, the State Department has said, but it was unclear whether officials were working for Waggoner's release. ""We have monitored his court appearances and continue to track the case closely,"" said P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the State Department, said earlier this week.","Paul Waggoner had been held for 18 days in Port-au-Prince .

"(CNN) -- About 50 Central American immigrants were kidnapped by gunmen earlier this month from a train crossing through Mexico, a Salvadoran official told CNN en EspaÃ±ol Wednesday. The government of Mexico has not confirmed or denied the incident. The incident has been mired in mystery since a priest who runs a shelter for immigrants first reported the story this week. He came forward after a group of immigrants who escaped from their would-be captors arrived and said that the incident took place December 16 in the town of Chahuites, in the state of Oaxaca near the border with Guatemala. Juan Jose Garcia, El Salvador's vice minister for Salvadorans abroad, said his government can confirm that the mass kidnapping happened as the survivors state. He said about 12 men armed with assault rifles and machetes forced the migrants off the train and divided them into two groups of about 25 each. Then they were taken to an unknown location, he said. But the Mexican government has not officially confirmed the incident happened. Mexican officials said that the country's National Migration Institute carried out an operation in the same area on the same night and noted that the train company did not report its train being delayed or stopped in the area. ""We cannot confirm it or deny it. We are acting on the complaint we received,"" Irma Pineiro, Oaxaca state's cabinet chief, told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. The priest who made the story public, Rev. Alejandro Solalinde, said the immigrants he spoke with believed the kidnappers were the Zetas drug cartel. The cartel is also believed behind the killings of 72 migrants in northern Mexico in August.","El Salvador says it has evidence that 50 migrants were kidnapped in Mexico .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- The number of properties lacking running water in Northern Ireland has dwindled to fewer than 1,000, state-funded water company Northern Ireland Water said Sunday. As of Saturday, the number was about 2,600, the company said. About 45,000 properties may still have limited water supplies Sunday night, compared to 60,000 on Saturday night. The disruption would cut supplies overnight as reservoirs are refilled. Many customers have been without running water for nearly a week, and some said they have not had water supply for more than 10 days. The shortage was blamed on the bursting of several major water pipes in a rapid thaw that followed record low temperatures last week. The company has said a number of pipes burst when the temperature rose from minus 16 to 10 degrees Celsius (3 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit) ""within a matter of hours."" The number of customers without water stood at 799 on Sunday, the company said, and 276 have a temporary supply. Northern Ireland Water has drawn criticism from government officials, who held an emergency meeting on the situation last week. The company's interim chairman, Padraic White, said its response to the ""unprecedented situation"" was ""unacceptable."" ""There remains a considerable demand for water arising from leaks on customers' private installations,"" the company said in a statement Sunday. ""Throughout this incident, NI Water has consistently reiterated the need for customers to check their premises for any damage to their own private infrastructure and to repair this as soon as possible. Failure to do so simply adds to the water supply problems for other customers."" The company asked customers to refrain from using garden hoses and washing cars. Some 500 staffers have been working to restore water service to those without supply, and the company was contacting customers in the affected areas to keep them apprised of the situation, Northern Ireland Water said. Company officials have also complained about a lack of investment in the water infrastructure over the years. Reservoir levels in the greater Belfast area remain low, the company said. Schools are expected to resume this week and next, and the company is ""confident there will be very few, if any, schools affected due to interruptions on the main water supply system,"" the statement said. ""However, many schools will have suffered damage to their internal infrastructure and we understand these are currently being located and repaired."" Northern Ireland Water is working with the Department of Education, and more information on schools was expected. Water restrictions were also continuing in the Republic of Ireland, where local authorities in many areas had to limit supply because of burst pipes after the freeze.","799 customers remain without water, state-funded company says .

"(CNN) -- Michael Vick, the comeback story like no other -- the nation's largest ongoing rehabilitation project not named Sheen -- makes his postseason splash Sunday night. A bigger audience means more fans than ever face this question: Can I embrace the Philadelphia quarterback's singular talents without getting the blood of past sins on me? It's been more than 19 months since Vick's release from federal prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, on his dogfighting conviction. And still the debate over his crime and his place back at the forefront of the NFL achieves spectacular extremes. Within two days in late December, the president of the United States congratulated Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie for giving Vick a second chance while a Fox News analyst suggested that Vick should have been executed for his crime. But this process of redemption also works itself out quietly, modestly, one oil change at a time. A Nissan dealer in Woodbury, New Jersey, has a played a small role in reintroducing Vick to the segment of society that doesn't kill dogs for sport. Thomas McMenamin, executive manager of the dealership, was the first businessman to sign the ex-con QB to an endorsement deal. Before the feds started digging around Vick's Bad Newz Kennels in Virginia, he was the hottest property in the league, making a reported $7 million a year in endorsements. Afterward, he was an untouchable. Now, for a series of promotional appearances and one television spot, he reportedly is receiving the free use of a $50,000 Nissan Armada. ""When we first met, he wasn't ashamed to admit that he did wrong and was wrong,"" McMenamin said. Would you buy a car from Michael Vick? McMenamin said the response has been mostly positive. ""We have gotten some phone calls from people saying, 'We'll never buy a car from you again,' but a lot of those came from out of town, from people who wouldn't buy here anyway."" To help ease the expected criticism, the dealership struck a promotional arrangement in which it would donate to the local humane society for every car sold until the end of January. McMenamin estimates the total should amount to $10,000. One episode last month struck the manager as telling. A customer came to him irate over how long it had taken the service department to perform a simple oil change. He left dramatically, vowing never to return. The next day, McMenamin's phone rang. It was the same disaffected customer. He had seen the Vick commercial that night. ""You gave Michael Vick a second chance, and I'm willing to give your store a second chance"" are the words McMenamin remembers. Sport has always had its gamblers and rogues, its cheats and addicts. In one Super Bowl night in Atlanta, Baltimore linebacker Ray Lewis became part of a double murder case (he eventually pleaded to misdemeanor obstruction of justice). The following year, 2001, he was the Super Bowl MVP. There'd be none of the usual failings for Vick, though. Like his skill set of speed, elusiveness and arm strength, his downfall had to be so out of the norm as to challenge belief. He'd bankroll a dog fighting ring. The cruelty of Vick's crime was spelled out in unsettling detail in the indictment against him, in passages such as: . ""In or about April 2007 (Purnell) Peace, (Quanis) Phillips and Vick executed approximately eight dogs that did not perform well in ""testing"" sessions by various methods including hanging, drowning and slamming at least one dog's body to the ground."" And the price he paid for his crime was steep: 23 months in prison, three years probation, bankruptcy and great heapings of public scorn. But fans love a good comeback story, and they are quick to grant forgiveness to those who lead them back to the top of the standings. Now, with Vick, they are being asked to process an entirely foreign kind of crime along with a startling kind of ability. It's like trying to read a Greek tragedy -- in Greek. After serving as a backup with the Eagles in 2009, Vick took over the starting role early this season. The team had shed its longtime marquee quarterback, Donovan McNabb, with plans of plugging in Kevin Kolb as his successor. But Kolb suffered a concussion, and Vick rediscovered his Vickness. At 30, he appeared to be a star at peak brightness. Against Washington in November, he put on such a show -- passing for four touchdowns and rushing for two others -- that the Hall of Fame requested his jersey. He threw for more than 300 yards three times in a month. (During six seasons in Atlanta, he had done that only twice.) Throwing for a career-high 21 touchdowns, with only six interceptions, he was 8-3 as an Eagles starter and led them to a division title. On Sunday, versus Green Bay, Vick returns to the site of his last playoff appearance, this time leading the home team at Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field. It has been seven eventful years since he last played the postseason. And that was a largely forgettable performance, the Atlanta Falcons losing in the 2003 NFC championship by 17 and their quarterback rendered practically invisible. He enters this game with an injured leg, and his last start, a loss to Minnesota, was his least productive of the season. But it's so much more than the numbers with Vick; it's how he amasses them. Dan Reeves, Vick's first coach in Atlanta and an unabashed supporter, is an old-school, understated football lifer. But on the subject of Vick, he raves: . ""(Vick's) just exciting. I love what Peyton Manning and Drew Brees and Tom Brady do. But it's different. They are great at what they do; I love to watch them, but Mike takes your breath away. ""You watch him and you say, 'How did he get away from that guy; how did he make that deep throw; how did he throw across his body like that?' "" By all accounts, Vick has dedicated himself to the craft of his position as never before. In interviews now, he sounds markedly more clear-headed than during his Atlanta days. He has struck all the right notes thus far this season, including dedicating himself to regular appearances on behalf of the anti-dog fighting campaign of the Humane Society of the United States. That cause has benefited even from those wishing Vick ill. A pair of Green Bay fans this season pledged $10 to the Humane Society for every time the quarterback was sacked. The total currently stands at $340. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told the Philadelphia Inquirer, ""This young man has turned his life around, and he's going to contribute."" While Vick never can outrun his past, there are signs that he has begun to at least give it a good race. Nowhere has the Vick conversation been more divisive than in Atlanta, where he was the franchise's No. 1 overall draft pick in 2001. His rise lifted the Falcons profile nationally and titillated the fan base like no other player, including Deion Sanders. And his fall absolutely laid waste to the franchise for two seasons. Chris Dimino, co-host of morning sports talk on Atlanta's 790 The Fan, has found himself moderating the debate over Vick's standing among Falcons fans. It often swings between vitriol and blind adoration, seeming to break down frequently along racial lines. ""I never thought I'd see the light at the end of that tunnel. But I do sense that there is a turn (in the tone of the conversation),"" Dimino said. ""Most people now are playing the good-for-him, give-him-a-second-chance card,"" he added. ""He was stupidity personified. He paid the price; now let's move on. People like a redemption story. ""Of course, if the Falcons weren't 13-3 now, there might be a heck of a lot more venom than there is now."" Vick's past and present teams may be on a collision course for an NFC Championship game meeting in Atlanta, at which time the old scab will be ripped clean off. Deciding on how to deal with Vick here at center stage would be so much easier if only there were a porthole to his soul, allowing a peek at what's really in there. How can any fan know? Vick's road to fan acceptance is the same one that will take him to a new contract; his two-year deal (which with bonuses and incentives have earned him a reported $7 million) runs out this season. He seems to realize the practical truth that what he does is going to amount to much more than what he utters. He recently told Sports Illustrated, ""I don't think me saying the right thing is going to get me a new deal. It's all about my play. It's all about how you conduct yourself as you play well. I don't have to put on a front around anybody."" The idea that people can change -- that's the notion Wayne Pacelle's life is built around. ""If it was my belief that people were static, I don't think I could come to work every day,"" says the president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States. Vick is just one of a number of former dog fighters and animal abusers that Pacelle's group has enlisted as spokesmen against cruelty. Vick has made a dozen appearances in major cities in the East, attempting to reach youngsters who could be lured into the practice of pitting dogs against each other in back alleys and abandoned buildings, so-called ""street fighting."" Pacelle said he has been asked a thousand times whether he believes Vick is sincere. Asked for the 1,001st time, he said, ""I don't get into that."" All he knows for sure is that he has seen Vick speak to hundreds of youngsters who, because of the quarterback's status, ""sit and listen in rapt attention."" Will the head of the Humane Society be rooting for the one-time dog fighter this weekend? Pacelle is one of the very few who remain mute on that subject.","Philadelphia Eagles quarterback makes his NFL postseason splash Sunday .

"(CNN) -- With only 100 days before the kick-off of the first World Cup to be staged in Africa, the host country's officials are confident that the footballing showpiece will be a success. South Africa's Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe told guests at a 100 Day Banquet in Durban to begin the countdown that his nation is ready to welcome the 32 competing teams and their supporters. Sepp Blatter, the president of world soccer's ruling body FIFA, was also present at the gala dinner. ""As we mark 100 days to the start of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, we do so with immense pride,"" Motlanthe said in a speech quoted on FIFA's Web site on Tuesday. Have your say on the World Cup.

""We have gathered here to begin a countdown to the greatest football tournament on earth. ""On behalf of the Republic of South Africa, I wish to extend our gratitude to all the men and women who have worked on the World Cup project and those who are still working on the last phase of our preparations."" When the tournament was handed to South Africa in 2004, many critics expressed doubts that sufficient infrastructure would be put in place to make such a huge undertaking possible. FIFA was quick to deny rumors that there was a back-up plan should South Africa not be ready for 2010, but a strike by construction workers in 2009 over pay led to more fears that the stadia would not be completed in time for this year's June 11 kick-off. However, the chairman of the 2010 FIFA World Cup Organizing Committee South Africa, Dr Irvin Khoza, said that the tournament was now almost a reality. ""When the countdown started there were 2,218 days -- we did not count in years and months. But when you arrive at 100 days it is the last three-digit number on the countdown,"" he said on FIFA's Web site. ""It is within this time period when people start applying for their leave, plan for their travel and even pay. People no longer say they are going to South Africa. They say 'I am flying to Durban, on this airline and staying in this hotel.' ""I would like to thank our people. Together, as South Africans and Africans, we have faced doubters and skeptics, we have faced critics and opponents. ""We have heard people say we cannot finish stadiums. We have heard people say we cannot provide safety and security. We have heard people say we cannot host the FIFA World Cup.

"(CNN) -- The holiday season is always a win for video gamers, as software makers jockey to one-up each other with slicker graphics, deeper play and more expansive 3-D worlds. But the larger and more complex modern-day epics like ""Fable III"" and ""Fallout: New Vegas"" become, the more it often pays to keep things simple. Classics such as ""Tetris"" and ""Pac-Man"" clearly illustrate this principle. As engaging today as they were when first launched decades back, it's these titles' sheer approachability and user-friendliness that make them timeless. Even the most sprawling modern-day gaming experiences, such as ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Call of Duty: Black Ops,"" still bow to the classic game design principle of keeping play easy to learn but hard to master. The successful games observe two vital rules: . 1) Find clever ways to spin the same basic concept (swapping tiles, stomping enemy heads, etc.) multiple times . 2) Tip learning curves in the players' favor by slowly introducing added depth at a comfortable pace . There's a reason why social games, including ""FarmVille"" and ""Mafia Wars,"" and iPhone apps such as ""Angry Birds"" and ""Pocket God"" continue to rack up millions of plays. It's not that these titles are revolutionary in design. It's that although the games are easy to start playing and enjoying, they increase in depth and complexity as the player gains more skill. This makes it less intimidating for players of all levels to try these games, which slowly entice us into their web. (Admittedly, the games' low price points, on-demand access and ample personality don't hurt either.) Make no mistake: Hardcore gaming enthusiasts do demand more value and substance from their titles than casual gamers. So designers are creating more robust virtual realms and expanding titles' value and scope through downloadable updates. Games in role-playing, simulation and strategy genres also thrive by adding greater intricacy, not less. In short, we'd weep for a world without the latest ""Civilization"" or ""Gran Turismo."" Instead of piling on pointless game variants or needlessly complicated controls, the most popular mass-appeal games often focus on executing a few simple features well -- and presenting them in endlessly novel contexts. What is ""Torchlight"" if not a smartly-placed series of mouse clicks, ""Bejeweled"" a simple slider puzzle or ""Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock"" a more high-tech version of Simon? No player likes to feel as if their favorite titles have been dumbed down. No designer appreciates admitting that behind all the fancy mission types, play modes and monsters, their basic play concept amounts to ""checkers with a twist,"" or simply tapping the right keys on cue. Still, why overcomplicate matters? Freeform missions, jaw-dropping graphics and extensive online multiplayer support make excellent window dressing. But even in the era of sprawling odysseys like ""Alan Wake"" and ""Red Dead Redemption,"" they remain secondary to a fun, engaging and approachable core game experience.","Simple games, including such classics as ""Tetris,"" are less intimidating to newcomers .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Given the magnitude of Japan's recession, it should perhaps come as little surprise that the fantasy-obsessed animation industry has received a hard dose of reality. Nobuki Mitani is an ""in-between"" animator -- one of the lowest paid positions in animation. Yasuo Yamaguchi, executive director of the Association of Japanese Animators, said the industry has been rocked by the country's deepest recession since World War II. ""The spread of free Internet downloading is having a deadly effect,"" he said. Japanese animation is roughly a $2 billion-a-year industry. Revenues peaked in 2006 but have since fallen off, as lower advertising revenues lead to fewer new programs. Yamaguchi said the animation industry is important to Japan's economy and that the government should be helping it through these tough times with subsidies.  Watch CNN's Morgan Neill report on anime Â» . Unlike some big screen animated features from the United States that rely almost completely on computer animation, in Japan, almost all features are drawn by hand -- a labor-intensive craft practiced by thousands of young artists each year. For the last six years, Nobuki Mitani, has been working as an ""in-between"" animator -- filling in the cells between ""key"" animations. It is one of the lowest paid positions in the animation hierarchy. Many of these entry-level jobs have been outsourced to the Philippines and South Korea in recent years. Mitani, 27, said the hours are long, and the pay is low -- about $800 a month. ""Every day I work about 10 to 12 hours,"" he said. ""Often, we work on Saturday, and if it's busy, we work Sunday, too."" In Tokyo, the world's most expensive city, that means living in cramped conditions. Mitani lives in a tiny one-room apartment with no air conditioning. In summer, the room is sweltering. ""I try not to drink water,"" he said, ""to control the sweating."" He has a shared sink at the end of the hall where he can wash his hands and face, but to bathe he has to go to a public bath. At the Tokyo Animation Institute, the classrooms are filled with students honing the craft, faces close to their sheets of paper, the only sound a hum from the electric pencil sharpener. The school's director, Yosuke Shimizu, said he knows many of his graduates will quit their first jobs after just months. ""Within half a year, some will take freelance jobs, some will take a key drawing job, and some will become sketch directors. Those who are good enough never complain about how hard the job is,"" he said. At Toei Animation Studios, conditions are better for the animators than in smaller studios. Toei has produced countless successes over the years, including the ""Dragonball"" series and the ongoing favorite ""One Piece."" But even here animation is an intense, demanding job. Naotoshi Shida has been working at Toei for 25 years. He said it takes much more than just a love of drawing to succeed. ""If someone is thinking of doing this just because they love drawing, that's called a hobby. They'd better think of doing something else.""","Association of Japanese Animators says industry rocked by recession .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Someone must be held responsible for a ""shambolic"" response to a water crisis that has left thousands without running water, one of Northern Ireland's top politicians said Thursday. Speaking after an emergency meeting of power-sharing ministers in Belfast, First Minister Peter Robinson said the government water company's efforts to restore water supplies to tens of thousands of homes was ""shambolic"" and ""ineffective."" He said a review would now be carried out by ministers and hinted at action against Northern Ireland Water's top executives . ""People must assess their own position, and of course if people don't assess their own position the review will look at where responsibility lies and decisions will be taken on the foot of that,"" said Robinson. Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness was also highly critical of the response, calling it ""totally unacceptable behaviour by an arm's-length body"". ""We are not prepared to accept this treatment on behalf of citizens,"" he said. ""... Under no circumstances are we going to stand here and make excuses for a body that has failed so miserably."" Northern Ireland Water said Thursday it could be early next week before all customers are reconnected. Up to 60,000 homes and businesses are experiencing water disruption, the company said in a written statement Thursday. Of those, 6,000 have lacked running water since Monday. However, on Tuesday some residents reported they had not had water for nine days. ""The numbers on a curtailed supply will vary from between 3,500 to 60,000 at any given time,"" the statement said. ""NI Water will continue to rotate supplies so figures will increase and decrease as this process is continued in order to protect reservoir levels."" Northern Ireland Water has said the ""unprecedented problems"" were caused by a rapid thaw, with a huge number of pipes bursting after a dramatic change in temperature -- from minus-16 to 10 degrees Celsius (3 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit) ""within a matter of hours."" Company officials have also complained about a lack of investment in the water infrastructure over the years. The company said it had increased the supply of water to its highest level ever -- from 600 million liters per day to 850 million liters per day (158 million gallons to 224 million gallons). ""This increase in demand is to a great degree as a result of leakage from bursts on private properties,"" the statement said. Doctors are warning of an increasing public health risk if the water shortages continue. Two hospitals have experienced supply problems. Emergency supplies were being made available at locations across the province, including recreation centers where those without running water were being offered free showers. The Scottish government has sent 160,000 liters (42,000 gallons) of bottled water to Northern Ireland after supplies ran out. Ahead of the meeting of ministers on Thursday, Ulster Unionist Party deputy leader John McCallister described the situation as ""Third World and horrendous."" He added: ""If the executive at Stormont (the Belfast government) isn't able to deal with this, the UK government will have to take over -- that's how bad things are."" In the Republic of Ireland, hundreds of thousands had supplies cut off or restricted, again as a result of burst pipes after the thaw. Repair crews worked to fix leaks, and mobile water supplies were being sent to the worst-hit areas. The Irish government said Thursday night most parts of the  country would see a resumption of normal water supply within the next two days,  but in the capital, Dublin, restrictions were expected to remain in place until January 10. Irish Minister for the Environment John Gormley said  significant progress was being made across the country to deal with water  leaks and stoppages. It was also announced restrictions on water supplies  were to be eased in most areas Friday night to facilitate New Year's Eve  celebrations.","Government officials say the government water company failed ""miserably""

"Business Insider is contributing a series of columns to CNN.com that challenge commonly held beliefs about the tech world. (Business Insider) -- Google loves to talk about how ""open"" Android, its operating system for mobile devices, is. Especially when it comes to comparisons between Android and Apple's iPhone, openness is Google's favorite talking point. But what, exactly, does it even mean that Android is ""open?"" Google would point to a number of broadly related facts about the OS, but here's the essential point: Android is ""open"" in that Google distributes its source code under something called the Apache License. Code distributed under an Apache License is free for anyone to use as they wish. Importantly, unlike some open source licenses, the Apache License lets anyone use the code in question as part of proprietary software. That is, if you write something and distribute it for free under the Apache License, I'm free to tack on some modifications, keep the added code a secret, and charge customers for the whole package. So, while Google likes to say that Android's openness is about giving the consumer freedom, the real freedom here has nothing to do with consumers. Consumers don't buy operating systems. They buy phones. Phone manufacturers -- and the mobile carriers with whom they form partnerships -- are free to add code to Android as they see fit before loading it on to their handsets and selling them to you. They're also free to throw up all sorts of hurdles to make it difficult for you to get rid of their software and install a ""clean"" version of Google's OS. The changes that handset makers and carriers make to Android are generally bad news for the consumer. Many pre-install shoddy, proprietary software -- ""bloatware"" -- which can't be removed, to drive users to their own services. They also cripple phone features. The latest version of Android, for instance, lets you use your phone as a mobile hotspot, allowing you to access the Internet wirelessly from your nearby computer, using the phone's data connection. Unfortunately, on most phones, that feature is broken by default, and can only be enabled by paying your carrier an extra monthly fee. Google's response to this is that because many different manufacturers are competing to sell Android phones, consumers will always win out in the end. If consumers didn't like the bloatware that came with their phones, other manufacturers wouldn't include it, the bad actors would lose customers, and everyone would have to adjust. As Eric Schmidt put it: ""that's how markets work."" That is how markets work in textbooks. It's also more or less how unrestricted markets for undifferentiated products with large numbers of sellers work in practice. Unfortunately, it's not how the market for cell phones works. There are just a handful of corporations in the world that make quality, high-end phones. And, in any given area, there are only a few carriers to provide service to those phones. There are two oligopolies in between you and Android, and they're working together. With all due respect to Eric Schmidt, that sort of market generally doesn't work very efficiently at all. To be fair, there are lots of great ways in which Android really does give users more freedom than the iPhone. For one thing, Google doesn't try to prevent you from downloading apps of which it doesn't approve. And, for the most part, opening up the OS to competition between different hardware manufacturers is terrific. These aspects of ""openness"" are a big part of why I switched to Android, and have no plans to go back. But letting handset makers and, especially, carriers make the Android experience worse is a bad move, and one the hurts Google's customers. And, contrary to what the company claims, it wouldn't have to betray any principles of open source to fix this. Google can go ahead and give away its source under the Apache License, and let people run wild with it. But it shouldn't give away the ""Android"" brand to any company that cripples the product. Google is spending lots of money hyping that brand, and it is staking its reputation on it. These companies are taking full advantage of that. Google can be open without letting companies release inferior products with Google's name on them. That kind of openness is bad news for the consumer, and ultimately bad news for Google.

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Northern Ireland's water supply is in a ""precarious position"" after several major water pipes burst, allowing 10 million liters of water to drain from Belfast reservoirs each day, the Northern Ireland Water interim chairman said Friday. The state-funded water company's response to the ""unprecedented situation"" was ""unacceptable,"" Padraic White said. Tens of thousands of homes and businesses have lost their supply after frozen pipes burst in a rapid thaw that followed record low temperatures last week. Many customers have been without running water since Monday, but some say they haven't had supplies for 10 days. Pipes at the country's top hospital, the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, were among those that failed, White said. Water service might not be fully restored until the middle of next week, but even then hundreds of rural homes could still be without water, he said. The water company's emergency call center was not prepared to handle ""a disaster of this magnitude,"" but communication with customers will be improved, White said. He recommended a full investigation into the company's problems. Northern Ireland Water has been heavily criticized for its response to the crisis, with some politicians calling for top officials to resign. Chairman White said company executives were not considering resignations, since their focus at the moment is restoring water service. The company said Friday that there had been an improvement in the situation in the past 24 hours and that the number of customers without water was down to around 5,000. It added, however, that as many as 24,000 customers could experience intermittent disruption to supplies as repairs continue. Northern Ireland Water has blamed the problems on a rapid thaw, with a huge number of pipes bursting after a dramatic change in temperature -- from minus-16 to 10 degrees Celsius (3 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit) ""within a matter of hours."" Company officials have also complained about a lack of investment in the water infrastructure over the years. The Republic of Ireland has also experienced problems with its water supplies. The government said Thursday night that most parts of the country would see a resumption of service within two days, but restrictions in the capital, Dublin, were expected to remain in place until January 10.","NEW: The water pipe to Belfast's top hospital burst .

"(CNN) -- One evening, when I was 24 years old, I heard Dr. Muhammad Yunus speak to a small classroom of Stanford University students. I was not a student at the time, so I crashed the lecture and sat quietly on the steps in the back of the room. What I heard that night changed my life. Dr. Yunus spoke of his journey in creating the Grameen Bank, which provides small loans to the poor. He told us about the incredible success many of Grameen's clients had achieved, breaking the cycle of poverty in their lives with only a few borrowed dollars and an entrepreneurial spirit. But beyond sharing his story, and beyond explaining the power of microfinance to change people's lives, Yunus spoke about the poor in a way I'd never before heard. He described them as hardworking, motivated, intelligent entrepreneurs who had the power to improve their own lives -- not hopeless, desperate, devastated individuals waiting for a donor to make everything better. Watch an interview with Jessica Jackley . Many of my assumptions about poverty, and about my role in helping to alleviate it, were turned upside down. (A few years after that evening lecture, Yunus and his Grameen Bank won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, honoring their work pioneering modern microfinance.) Listening to Yunus speak that night, I was inspired to do something. I wanted to meet hardworking entrepreneurs like the ones he'd talked about, and to truly understand their stories. A few weeks later, I quit my job at Stanford and boarded a plane to Nairobi, Kenya, to try to do just that. TED.com: Paul Collier on ""the bottom billion"" Over the next few months, I interviewed over a hundred entrepreneurs throughout East Africa who had received $100 to start or grow their microenterprises. I formed powerful connections with many of those entrepreneurs, all of whom were working hard every day to lift themselves and others out of poverty -- a seamstress in Kenya who used her business profits to send her daughters to school; a goat-herder in Uganda who could finally afford mosquito nets for his family; a farmer in Tanzania who explained proudly how she could now, for the first time, feed her children three meals a day. These dignified individuals showed me how even a simple endeavor could be run with incredible acumen, creativity, and wisdom. It was through their stories of perseverance and optimism that my beliefs about poverty, about empowerment, about entrepreneurship, and about my own path began to shift. I wondered how the world might be different if more people could hear their stories, in detail, one at a time. And I wondered what it would be like to participate in the next chapter of their stories in a way that dignified them, not pitied them. What if a community of people could gather together to lend the next few hundred dollars they needed for their businesses to grow? My desire to answer these questions inspired the creation of Kiva (http://www.kiva.org/), the world's first peer-to-peer microlending website. On Kiva, people can lend as little as $25 to specific entrepreneurs and get their money back when the entrepreneur repays. In a little over five years since its founding, Kiva has been one of the fastest-growing social benefit websites in history, facilitating more than $170 million in loans across 208 countries. Building on lessons learned at Kiva, I've now turned my attention back home to focus on serving small business here in the U.S. as co-founder and CEO of ProFounder (http://www.profounder.com/). ProFounder is a crowd-funding platform for American entrepreneurs to raise investments from their friends, families and communities. An unlimited number of unaccredited investors can invest and choose either to receive a share of the business's revenues as cash, or redirect them to a nonprofit. TED.com: Andrew Mwenda takes a new look at Africa . Entrepreneurs can create a simple fundraising website including legally compliant investment terms, raise seed capital online, manage their community of supporters, pay investors dividends over time, provide regular updates on their business's progress, and much more. It is my hope that ProFounder can change the way we support small businesses and start-ups in America. I believe in entrepreneurs. I believe in their ability to make positive change in the world. I want to see a world in which every entrepreneur has access to the resources he or she needs to succeed, and where through the power of supportive communities -- that means you and me -- every resource can be made available. Whether you are a goat-herder in the Great Rift Valley, a tech start-up guru in Silicon Valley, or someone simply eager to see an entrepreneur succeed, I invite you to join me. Invest in an entrepreneur. Become an entrepreneur. There is a new story to be written together. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jessica Jackley.","Jessica Jackley was inspired by the example of Muhammad Yunus .

"(Mashable)  -- Sony has unveiled its newest line of Internet-enabled TVs, complete with the highly-anticipated Google TV software. Sony's new Internet HDTVs, unveiled earlier today at a press event in New York City, sport 1080p edge-lit LED screens, with the exception of the 24? model. They come with four USB ports, four HDMI inputs and Wi-Fi capabilities. They are available in four sizes: 24?, 32?, 40? and 46?. The 24? model rings in at $599 while the 46? will cost you a hefty $1,399. The big selling point of the new TVs is their inclusion of Google TV. The Internet TV software brings Hulu, Twitter, Netflix, YouTube and Pandora to your living room screen, not to mention search capabilities and a myriad of Android apps. Web surfing is powered by Google Chrome, while apps are powered by the Android OS. It integrates the web with your existing cable or satellite TV by making it simple to search your TV shows and your favorite websites at the same time. The service was revealed earlier this year at Google I/O. One of the more controversial parts of Sony's new Google TV-enabled devices is the remote, though. It looks like a combination of a PlayStation 3 controller and a QWERTY keyboard, complete with dozens and dozens of buttons. In fact, Sony says some of the remote's design elements are borrowed from the PS3. Some people may love the extra functionality, but others might be turned off by all of the buttons. The new TVs become available this Saturday on SonyStyle.com and in Best Buy stores nationwide this Sunday, making this weekend the first indicator of whether consumers are demanding TVs that can also surf the web. Google desperately wants to dominate the living room screen and get people to use the web even more than they already do. Whether consumers will pony up the extra cash for Google TV devices is a question we'll soon be able to answer. Â© 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"Nova Friburgo, Brazil (CNN) -- The death toll from devastating flooding in Brazil continued to rise Sunday, surpassing 600, the government said. At least 631 deaths were reported in a mountainous region of Rio de Janeiro state, northeast of the city of Rio. Other states in the South American country have also seen heavy rainfall. Are you there? Share your photos, videos and stories . Last week, authorities in neighboring Sao Paulo state said 24 people had been killed by flooding. Forecasters there said late Sunday that an approaching cold front could bring more flooding and landslides. Most of the deaths in Rio de Janeiro state were reported in the cities of Nova Friburgo and Teresopolis, with 287 and 269 fatalities, respectively. The state's health and civil defense department reported 56 fatalities in the town of Petropolis and 19 in Sumidouro. Officials in that office also warned residents of the risk of waterborne diseases. Several thousand vaccines against tetanus and diphtheria have been distributed, they said. Rescuers have not been able to reach some hard-hit areas, and many more people are feared dead. The rain is predicted to continue for several days in areas already submerged in water or slathered with mud. Members of the army entered parts of Teresopolis and were able to rescue 110 families. Thousands of families are still living on mountain slopes or on riverbanks and face extreme risk of being washed away. One resident described the disaster as a tsunami that fell from the sky. In a statement, Rio Gov. Sergio Cabral said he had a panic attack when he was traveling to Nova Friburgo and saw a devastated mountainside. Outside a makeshift morgue in Teresopolis, a crowd of people waited for their turn to identify loved ones. Marco Antonio Siqueira Costa said the last time he saw his brother, sister-in-law and niece was a few days ago, before mud buried their house. ""I think that last meeting was God's way of granting us a farewell,"" he said. Residents in the city donned masks and helped clean streets or deliver first aid. Others combed the city, searching desperately for missing loved ones. Red Cross volunteer Maria Helena de Jesus was helping with first aid. ""You have to almost have a heart of stone,"" she said. ""It was very difficult."" Teresopolis Mayor Jorge Mario Sedlacek declared his city a natural disaster area. President Dilma Rousseff flew over flood-affected areas last week and landed in Friburgo, the agency said. The floods are her first test as president. She trudged through mud to talk to residents in a neighborhood where four of seven firefighters trying to rescue people had been buried under mud. The other three were pulled out alive. ""We are going to take firm action"" to help the devastated areas, said Rousseff. Brazilian authorities have been criticized for a lack of disaster planning and allowing people to build homes in areas known to become treacherous in the rainy season. They are under increasing pressure to show a strong response. Brazil is scheduled to host the World Cup in 2014 and the 2016 Olympics.

"(CNN) -- Manchester United returned to the top of the Premier League on Sunday after a 0-0 draw against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. A close fought affair -- which marked the 600th league appearance of Ryan Giggs -- ended with honors even despite United defender Rafael Da Silva being sent off for two bookable offences in the 74th minute. His second yellow for a trip on Assou-Ekotto was adjudged to be deliberate, but a clearly incensed Rafael thought otherwise as he remonstrated with referee Mike Dean about the decision. Spurs had the better chances to win the match with Rafael Van der Vaart missing a glorious opportunity to claim three points in the 80th minute after a mistake in the United defence gave him a unopposed shot on goal. But the Dutch international could only curl his shot narrowly over the bar. Kenny Dalglish earned the first point of his second spell in charge of Liverpool as the Merseyside derby against Everton ended in a 2-2 draw at Anfield. Raul Meireles' first goal for Liverpool gave the Reds a deserved lead after 30 minutes in a half in which they dominated. But Everton hit back after the break with two goals in six minutes to take the lead. Sylvain Distin headed home after 46 minutes and Jermaine Beckford stunned the home supporters as he drilled home past Jose Reina to hand the Toffees the lead. But when Tim Howard brought down Maxi Rodriguez following a corner in the 66th minute, Dirk Kuyt made no mistake from the penalty spot. Liverpool and Everton both have 26 points, with Everton one place above their rivals thanks to a superior goal difference. In the other two matches played Sunday, the Tyneside derby ended in a 1-1 draw as Sunderland's Asamoah Gyan scored four minutes into injury time to deny Newcastle the three points and a season double over their arch rivals. A neat backheel by Kevin Nolan had given the Magpies the lead seven minutes into the second half. Newcastle looked destined to win the match until the Ghanaian striker put the ball in the net after a shot from Phil Bardsley shot had been saved by Steve Harper. Sunderland stay in sixth place, while Newcastle are ninth. Aston Villa have moved out of the relegation zone after salvaging a 1-1 draw with local rivals Birmingham at St Andrews. Roger Johnson volleyed home early in the second half to give the home side the lead but James Collins squared things up after 73 minutes when he drove a shot home after Gabriel Agbonlahor had flicked the ball onto him. Birmingham remain in 16th place with 23 points on points, one place and one point ahead of Villa.","Man U draw 0-0 with Spurs to return to the top of the Premier League on goal difference .

"(CNN) -- She hit the big time in the 1980's with Eurythmics and found huge success as a solo artist with her 1992 album ""Diva"", but for singer Annie Lennox, being able to express her passion has always been the motivating factor in whatever she's done. Annie Lennox will continue to SING with her AIDS awareness charity. As a result her musical career has taken a back seat to her political activism and charity work in recent years; most notably with SING her AIDS awareness in Africa charity, as well as working with Amnesty, Save the Children and as a UNICEF ambassador. Yet the 54-year-old maintains that she'll always keep singing as well as working on the other things that she feels passionate about. ""I'm a multi-tasker. I have to do a lot of things at once. I love music. And I want to keep making music. I hope that I'll always be a music-maker and I'll always be an activist,"" she told CNN in Hong Kong. Growing up in Aberdeen, Scotland, Lennox found enormous success with Eurythmics and the 1983 album ""Sweet Dreams"" and single of the same name. It catapulted her to international success and stardom, something she had always wanted, but at first found difficult to adjust to. ""We were really on a whole kind of roller coaster with [Eurythmics], which on the one hand I was very grateful for, and on the other hand, it sort of sucked out your life, any sort of privacy,"" she said. ""Just the ability to be anonymous which I absolutely really value. I love to just to be mixing with people and not have to be the one person in the room with the spotlight and the heads all turning. So that was a little bit hard to adapt to...I might as well have a neon light for a head."" She's sold over 80 million records during a career that has spanned four decades, which she credits to hard graft fueled by an unending passion for music. ""The glamour side to it is what we see as the end result. But all the rest of it is hard work and dedication. And it's not easy always, you have to be very focused. And you have to be really, really motivated to do it. You have to have a kind of yearning, a passion for that. ""I was never thinking, 'Oh, I'm in this for the long haul.' I just think as I'm still thinking, I want to have a life where I'm able to do the thing that makes me feel alive."" Aware of the downsides of a career in music, Lennox also has a greater sense of the perils and pitfall in life, something she has often expressed in her music. ""I have encountered individuals and I've encountered things in the industry that were vile. Bad things happen everywhere. And the music industry and all that surrounds it, is no exception."". Having experienced unscrupulous people in the music industry and been through her own personal upheaval through two failed marriages, Lennox remain passionate, energetic and sanguine. Ultimately, she says, ""its all part of life's rich tapestry.""","Sold over 80 million records in career that has spanned four decades .

"(CNN)  -- Liverpool striker Ryan Babel has been fined Â£10,000 ($15,890) by the English Football Association (FA) for posting doctored photos of referee Howard Webb on his Twitter blog. Babel was found guilty of improper conduct Monday by an FA regulatory commission and warned about his future conduct. He is the first Premier League footballer to be charged and fined for ""inappropriate"" tweeting. The Dutch international used his Twitter account to criticize Webb, who took charge of Liverpool's FA Cup third round match against Manchester United. World Cup final referee Webb awarded United a disputed penalty and then sent off Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard as they slipped to a 1-0 defeat in Kenny Dalglish's first match at the Anfield helm. Babel later posted a mocked-up picture of Webb wearing a Manchester United shirt and also wrote: ""And they call him one of the best referees? That's a joke."" He later apologized and said it was meant to be light-hearted, but the FA took a dim view. Dalglish makes losing start as Liverpool go out . Commission chariman Roger Burden said: ""Social network sites must be regarded as being in the public domain. ""All participants need to be aware, in the same way as if making a public statement in other forms of media, that any comments would be transmitted to a wider audience. ""It is their responsibility to ensure only appropriate comments are used."" Babel had run into trouble on Twitter before, being forced to apologize to former Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez for comments he published after being dropped. Meanwhile, Manchester United full-back Rafael has been charged with improper conduct by the FA for his outburst at referee Mike Dean after being sent off in Sunday's goalless draw at Tottenham.

"London, England (CNN) -- The group poised to launch a takeover bid for English Premier League side Manchester United has signaled its intent by appointing a major international bank to act as its financial adviser. The ""Red Knights"" consortium, made up of wealthy businessmen, has employed Japanese investment bank Nomura to help with its $1 billion move for the club, currently owned by the American Glazer family. The Knights say Nomura will now work closely with the Manchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST) and other potential investors to ""coordinate and formulate the proposal to be put to the Glazer family,"" according to a statement. The bank's team will be led by Guy Dawson and Andrew McNaught, both of whom advised Manchester United's board when the club was sold to the Glazers in 2005. Their first job will be to firm up offers of financial support pledged to the Red Knights' cause, and help on any proposal that is eventually put to the club. The Glazers have been criticized for the levels of debt at the current English champions, with the latest accounts showing that United are more than $1 billion in the red. The owners recently launched a bond issue to raise $750 million to reduce the debt. They also own NFL side Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Red Knights' announcement comes just hours after the most vocal protest yet from Manchester United supporters against the Glazer family, during Wednesday's European Champions League last 16 victory over AC Milan. Fans unveiled banners that read: ""Love United Hate Glazer."" The green and gold scarves that have become a symbol of their disquiet were also prevalent at Old Trafford. The club's chief executive, David Gill, told a football conference last week that the Glazers were not interested in selling the club. Nevertheless the Red Knights are pressing ahead. In a statement confirming the appointment of Nomura, the group said: ""The Red Knights are pleased to confirm that Nomura, the global investment bank, has agreed to advise on a possible acquisition of Manchester United. ""Nomura will work closely with the Red Knights, MUST and other potential investors to co-ordinate and formulate the proposal to be put to the Glazer family.

"London, England (CNN) -- Irish football officials have lodged an official complaint with world ruling body FIFA after Thierry Henry confessed that he handled the ball in the build-up to the goal which sent France to next summer's World Cup. Television cameras showed Henry guiding the ball with his hand twice, before William Gallas scored from his resulting cross to give ""Les Bleus"" a narrow win in the two-legged World Cup play-off against the Republic of Ireland. ""I will be honest. It was a handball but I am not the referee,"" the Barcelona striker told reporters after the match in Paris. The Irish Justice Ministry confirmed to CNN that Dermot Ahern had asked the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) to demand a replay in the interests of fair play. ""Thierry Henry has admitted handling the ball, claims he told the ref he handled it. Millions of people worldwide saw it was a blatant double handball -- not to mention a double offside -- and we should put the powers that be in the cozy world of FIFA on the spot and demand a replay,"" Ahern said in a statement sent to CNN. ""They probably won't grant it as we are minnows in world football but let's put them on the spot. It's the least we owe the thousands of devastated young fans around the country. Otherwise if that result remains it reinforces the view that if you cheat you will win."" The FAI later confirmed that it had taken the matter to FIFA. ""I really believe the integrity of the game has been questioned last night,"" chief executive John Delaney told reporters. ""The governing body of world football have to step up to the plate and accede to our call for a replay."" Delaney said the FAI had also written to the French football federation. ""They need to look at themselves in this situation. Henry is their captain and a wonderful footballer, but does he want to be like Diego Maradona and his legacy to be this handball, this goal that got them to the World Cup in an unjust manner? If we had qualified in this manner, I wouldn't be happy,"" he said. ""It is up to the people who govern the game now. Every time I go to a FIFA congress I hear about fair play and integrity. This was a defining game with the whole world watching, and if FIFA believe in fair play and integrity, this is their opportunity to step forward."" The FAI has argued that there is a precedent for the result to be struck out, following FIFA's ruling that Uzbekistan had to replay a play-off against Bahrain  for the 2006 World Cup in Germany after the referee made a mistake in awarding a penalty. ""The Football Association of Ireland is hoping that FIFA and its disciplinary committee will, on behalf of football fans worldwide, act in a similar fashion so that the standards of fair play and integrity can be protected,"" the FAI said. FIFA confirmed it had received the Irish request for a replay, but gave no timescale on a decision. However, it said that under its regulations the referee's decision cannot be changed. ""Law 5 states that the decisions of the referee regarding facts connected with play, including whether or not a goal is scored and the result of the match, are final,"" it said. ""The referee may only change a decision on realising that it is incorrect or, at his discretion, on the advice of an assistant referee or the fourth official, provided that he has not restarted play or terminated the match."" Irish captain Richard Dunne, who spoke to Henry on the final whistle, said he felt cheated by the goal. ""He admitted he handled it, but it doesn't make me feel any better because we are not going to the World Cup finals,"" the defender said. ""FIFA will probably be happy. Yet again the big decisions have gone for the bigger team."" Football's international governing body had faced criticism from several Irish players that the seeding system for the play-off draw favored more powerful nations such as France. Blog: When will FIFA see what's staring them in the face? Dunne's teammate Robbie Keane admitted it was ""hard to speak,"" as he struggled to come to terms with the result. ""With the way we played, we certainly deserved to win the game and it killed us near the end with that handball,"" he was quoted by the FAI Web site as saying. ""I've seen the replay but we knew anyway (it was handball). You could see by the reaction of the players, especially Shay (Given) who was two yards away from it. You don't get a reaction like that. It was a clear handball. ""He (Henry) almost caught the ball and actually ran into the net with it. We're devastated."" Ireland team manager Giovanni Trapattoni told reporters that the referee had time to ask the linesman and then Henry. ""It would not have been the first time a player would have asked and it would not have been out of turn. ""We are angry,"" the Italian continued. ""It is a bitter evening for me. I would prefer to have gone out on penalties."" Fanzone: Five of football's most famous injustices . But former France international David Ginola was emphatic that Henry should not have ""owned up."" ""You don't do that,"" he told CNN. ""Henry was doing his job. You can't blame him for doing everything he could for his team and country to get them to South Africa. ""But it was a shame to finish the game like that as Ireland had played very well. ""Referees need more help on the pitch, so as not to allow things like that. Obviously the referee was not well-positioned and couldn't see."" English Referees Union chief Alan Leighton told CNN that Swedish official Martin Hansson had clearly missed a huge decision. ""I think the incident was more of instinct than deliberately attempting to cheat but it does seem that the ball hit his hand twice and therefore there is an issue."" But on the wider issue of cheating, Leighton said: ""It is all very well to blame the referees for not spotting it but fundamentally it starts with the players. ""I think the players have to think about the game, think about the reputation of the game and their own reputations and say look actually there is a line that we will not cross.""","NEW: Republic of Ireland officials lodge official complaint with world ruling body FIFA .

"(CNN) -- Taking dietary supplements containing essential fatty acids can help reduce the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, according to the results of study by researchers at a Brazilian university. The study, published Monday in the journal Reproductive Health, found that taking capsules containing about 1 gram of a blend of three essential fatty acids produced a significant reduction in PMS symptoms. Essential fatty acids are substances that are not produced by the human body and are only available from diet. Eggs, nuts, vegetable oils and fish are examples of foods that provide such acids, which are also available in supplement form. The study, authored by researchers from the Federal University of Pernambuco, is not the first to address the possible link between PMS and essential fatty acids, substances that play a complicated role in a woman's reproductive system. The study cites research dating back to 1983 examining such a possible link. According to the study, the 120 women who participated reported few side effects, and most of those were mild and may have been due to sensitivity to mineral oil, the placebo taken by some of the participants. The supplements taken by women in the study contained 210 mg of gamma linolenic acid, 175 mg of oleic acid, 345 mg of linoleic acid, 250 mg of other polyunsaturated acids and 20 mg of vitamin E, according to researchers. According to the study, women who took the supplements for six months saw a bigger benefit than those who took them for three months. The researchers do not make any recommendation in their study about whether women who suffer from PMS should increase their intake of essential fatty acids or, instead, consult with their doctor. Other treatments studied for PMS include vitamin B6, ascorbic acid and niacin.","A new study suggests esential fatty acids may help ease the symptoms of PMS .

"(CNN) -- Police and the mother of a 4-year-old California boy clung to hope Thursday for the child's safety, days after a man allegedly snatched the pre-schooler from his grandmother's arms then took off. An Amber Alert was issued for Juliani Cardenas, who authorities say was abducted by Jose Esteban Rodriguez in the northern California town of Patterson. ""He (Rodriguez) wanted to be with my son,"" Tabitha Cardenas told reporters Thursday, adding that she had broken up with Rodriguez four or five months ago. ""He wanted to be with my son so bad that he took it to the extreme."" Yet authorities feared the worst, after a witness reported seeing a car matching that of the alleged kidnapper plunge into the Delta-Mendota Canal. But they were not able to locate the vehicle during searches Thursday. ""We believe the suspect drove the car into the canal, with little Juliani inside,"" Stanislaus County Sheriff Adam Christianson told HLN's Nancy Grace. ""But so far, we haven't been able to locate the car."" Christianson said that the search will resume Friday, with help from the neighboring Merced County sheriff's department, using side-scanning sonar. The sheriff, though, also held out hope that the witness may have been mistaken -- and Juliani, in fact, never went underwater. ""There's still hope that we're going to be able to find Juliani alive,"" he said. In an emotional press conference Thursday, the boy's mother said she believes Rodriguez is troubled -- claiming he told her that he sometimes ""hears voices"" and that he had been abusive when they were dating -- but she did not think he would drown her son or consciously put him in danger. Rodriguez is not the boy's biological father. ""He's scared, Jose's scared -- I know he is,"" said Cardenas. ""He probably doesn't know what to do."" The suspect had come to Cardenas' house early Tuesday morning, according to the boy's mother, leaving after she told him to leave because Juliani was asleep and had a cold. The boy's school later called Tabitha Cardenas after Rodriguez had gone there asking to spend time with the boy. In the late afternoon, Cardenas got a call from her frantic mother, who claimed that the Rodriguez had again come by and, despite her struggle, had taken the boy from the grandmother's arms. Cardenas said that her mother told her that the suspect then flashed an obscene gesture, laughed and got into his 2003 silver Toyota Corolla, which he had left running. The boy, Juliani, is 3 feet, 6 inches tall, weighs 40 pounds and has brown eyes and black hair, according to the Amber Alert. He was wearing dark pants and a light blue shirt at the time of his abduction. Rodriguez, 27, is described in the same alert as being a Hispanic male, about 180 pounds and 5 feet, 9 inches tall. Tabitha Cardenas, who broke down several times while addressing reporters, said she especially was worried that her son was not getting enough water or food. She issued an urgent plea to Rodriguez, who she said took their break-up hard but stayed in contact, to drop off her son at a hospital or fire department. ""Please, I need him home,"" she said. ""I know he's telling you that he's missing me. You need to bring him home.""","An Amber Alert has been issued for Juliani Cardenas, 4, of Patterson, California .

"(CNN)  -- Ashes hero Alastair Cook has all but given up hope of playing for England in the World Cup in the sub-continent next month. Despite his run-scoring feats in the recent 3-1 Test series win against Australia, the opener has not featured recently in the England squad for the shorter forms of cricket, including the 50-over per side format used in the World Cup. Cook told CNN that he is in direct competition for an opening slot with captain Andrew Strauss and does not rate his chances of inclusion very highly when the final 15-man line-up is announced on Wednesday. ""Myself and Straussy do quite a similar role at the top of the order, our styles are very similar. Possibly as he's captain he's going to take a lot to shift,"" he said. The 26-year-old amassed 766 runs in the five-Test Ashes series, the second best ever by an England player, and clearly wants to keep up the momentum. Injured Tendulkar gets World Cup call . ""It's a little bit frustrating, especially when you're in a little bit of form, but the selectors have been building towards this for a while now and they're plans and unfortunately I've not been in it,"" he admitted. ""But cricket's a strange game, sport's a strange game, and you never know,"" he added. Whether he gains a place for the World Cup, or gets a call-up later during the tournament as a replacement, Cook's place in cricket history is assured after a hitting double century and two other centuries as England emphatically retained the Ashes Down Under. ""To achieve that, and the manner in which we achieved it, was very special,"" he said. ""The support we've had from everyone in Australia and back here has just been fantastic,"" added Cook, who has been awarded the freedom of the City of London in honor of his exploits. Yet, ironically, the Essex opener's place was under threat for the tour after a sorry run of form in England's summer Tests which left him low on confidence and self-belief. ""It was very low, confidence is only bred by success. ""That was quite a defining moment for me in my career. When I really, really needed a score personally and under pressure from the media and probably thinking I shouldn't play, to be able to deliver, I think that really helped me in Australia.""

The 800-mile line was shut down January 8 when a leak was found during an inspection of a pump house.

"(CNN) -- European football clubs are bucking the trend of the worldwide recession, with England's Premier League leading the way after posting $3.4 billion in revenues for the 2007-08 season. Premier League clubs spent more on wages last season than in any year since its inception in 1992. The Premier League extended its financial superiority over its nearest rivals in Germany and Spain to more than $1.4 billion, according to Deloitte's Annual Review of Football Finance. This result from its 20 clubs came despite the British pound's 15 percent devaluation against the Euro currency, Deloitte said. Italy's Serie A was the fastest growing league, increasing its total revenue by 34 percent to $1.99 billion -- with the return of Turin giants Juventus to the top flight contributing two-thirds of that upturn. The total European football market grew by $1.4 billion to $20.76 billion, fueled by a $995 million increase in the 'big five' leagues plus the staging of the Euro 2008 finals in Austria and Switzerland. Deloitte's Dan Jones, one of the authors of the report, said he expected English clubs to continue being profitable despite the uncertain economic climate, but perhaps not at the same ""remarkable"" rate. ""Between 1992 and 2008, revenues for the top 20 clubs grew at a compound annual rate of 16 percent, compared with 5.4 percent for the UK economy as a whole,"" he said. ""Revenue increased by 26 percent in 2007/08 and Premier League clubs generated $1.3 million more revenue than their nearest rivals from the other 'big 5' leagues. ""It will, of course, be hard to maintain this pace in the immediate future. The new economic realities may lead to flat match-day revenues. While attendances continue to hold up well, many clubs have frozen or reduced ticket prices. ""However, the stepped increases in the current domestic broadcast deal and the new UEFA Champions League TV deal make it likely overall revenues will edge up."" Deloitte said most of the increased broadcast revenue had been spent on player wages and transfers. Wage costs in the Premier League soared by $372 million, or 23 per cent, in 2007/08 to reach $1.96 billion -- which represented its largest annual increase since its inception in 1992. Chelsea were the biggest spenders on $282 million, ahead of champions Manchester United ($198 million), Arsenal ($165 million) Liverpool ($148 million) and Newcastle ($123 million) -- whose relegation at the end of the 2008/09 season could have dire financial implications for the club. Meanwhile, Premier League clubs' spending on player transfers in both the summer 2008 and January 2009 transfer windows reached new record levels with an estimated $1.1 billion paid out. Deloitte's Alan Switzer commented: ""Despite this increase in wage costs, Premier League clubs improved their wages/revenue ratio to 62 percent and generated record operating profits in 2007/08 of Â£185 million ($303 million). ""However lower revenue growth in forthcoming seasons means clubs will have to focus on improving cost control -- both wages and other operating costs -- if profits are to be maintained."" Deloitte said while the Premier League's total debt had risen, two-thirds of this was taken up by the top four clubs -- Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United -- and around $2 billion of it was non-interest bearing ""soft loans"". ""On the positive side of the balance sheet, these four clubs also had Â£1 billion ($1.64 billion) of assets in respect of investment in stadia and other facilities and a further Â£450m ($738m) from investment in players,"" said Deloitte's Paul Rawnsley.","Europe's leading football clubs are bucking the trend of worldwide recession .

"(CNN)  -- World No. 2 Rafael Nadal overcame last year's nemesis Robin Soderling to win the World Tennis Championship exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi on Saturday. The Spaniard, whose defeat to the Swede in the French Open triggered the unraveling of his season amid injury problems, won 7-6 (7-3) 7-5 as he began his build-up to the defense of his Australian Open title in encouraging style. Soderling, who also defeated Nadal at the season-ending ATP World Tour finals in London, had come into the match buoyed by his breakthrough first victory against world No. 1 Roger Federer in the semifinals on Friday. Having taken the first set to a tie-break, Soderling fought back from 4-2 down in the second set to level at 4-4 but Nadal -- who lost to Andy Murray in the final last year -- showed no signs of the inconsistency that plagued the latter half of his 2009 campaign as he clinched victory. Earlier on Saturday, Federer claimed third place with a 6-1 7-5 victory against Spain's David Ferrer. The tournament, which is not an official ATP Tour event, also featured Russia's Nikolay Davydenko and Federer's Swiss compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka. Wawrinka replaced Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the field after the Frenchman pulled out with a wrist injury. Federer and Nadal will next head to Doha for the opening tournament of the ATP Tour schedule, while world No. 8 Soderling will be top seed for the Chennai Open in India.","World No. 2 Rafael Nadal wins World Tennis Championship exhibition event in Abu Dhabi .

"(CNN) -- As much as 8 feet of snow has fallen in parts of Japan since Sunday, slowing train travel and forcing automaker Toyota to close down 12 factories. The heavy snow disrupted the bullet train, or Shinkansen, system in central Japan on Sunday and Monday, affecting 67,000 passengers, according to Central Japan Railway. Snow totals on the ground Monday ranged from nearly 3 feet in Shimane Prefecture to 8 feet in Tottori Prefecture, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. Passengers on the bullet train network also suffered delays Monday due to a problem with a computer control system. The failure disrupted traffic for 75 minutes Monday morning, disrupting bullet trains nationwide for most of Monday morning, according to East Japan Railway. Toyota also had to close 12 factories Monday in Aichi Prefecture as heavy snowfall caused problems getting car parts to the facilities.

"San Antonio, Texas (CNN)  -- Melissa Coleman has amazing stories to tell and some family members still can't get enough of the harrowing tales of her 33 days as a prisoner of war during the first Gulf war. Even 20 years after the start of that war, Coleman can captivate an audience. She tells family friends or her daughters' classmates about American bombs that struck close to where she was held by her Iraqi captors. ""That was the biggest fear for me, I didn't think the Iraqis were going to kill me, but I was afraid of one of our bombs,"" Coleman tells CNN. Or the story of how the Iraqi soldiers spared her the worst punishment because they were convinced she was an ignorant woman. She outsmarted them anyway. ""I played along with it,"" Coleman says. ""I really don't know anything. I'm just a woman."" But 20 years after her 33 days as a POW, Coleman is fighting another battle: breast cancer. She was diagnosed five months ago and is preparing for a fourth round of chemotherapy. Coleman says being a POW ""helped me keep a positive outlook because I know what I can withstand."" ""I know that I've survived something as dangerous, if not more dangerous, so I feel like I'm going to make it."" Coleman says her doctors have removed all of the cancerous tumors for now and that she's been given a ""good"" prognosis. The former Army specialist says she rarely thinks about her days as POW, but during those 33 days, Coleman was one of the most visible faces of the war. Coleman was driving a truck on January 30, 1991, near the southern Iraq border. After a couple of confusing wrong turns, Coleman and another soldier riding alongside her found themselves in the middle of a firefight and surrounded by Iraqi soldiers. Her parents, Leo and Joan Rathbun, held vigil from their home outside Grand Rapids, Michigan. It was an excruciating and painful wait. Not knowing if she was still alive, the Rathbun's received a Valentine's Day card that she had mailed just hours before being captured. ""When I first heard, I just sat by the TV and just cried the whole rest of the day. So, it was difficult,"" Leo Rathbun says. But then came the 3 a.m. phone call that sent an eruption of joy through the Rathbun's home. A CNN producer called and told the family to turn on their television. For the first time in 33 days, the Rathbun's saw their daughter safe and alive being turned over by the Iraqis to the International Red Cross. Looking back through the long lens of time, Coleman's parents say the POW experience changed their daughter in a fundamental way. ""She's a lot more serious about life and relationships now than what she was before,"" Joan Rathbun says. ""Everyone means more to her. Life means more to her now."" Now she lives a quiet life in San Antonio with her husband and two teenage daughters. Her oldest daughter, Briana, wants to join the Army and that's sparked a minor tug-of-war in the family. Coleman isn't comfortable with the idea, but Briana isn't giving up. The Coast Guard might be an acceptable compromise. That's the kind of battle Coleman prefers these days, the struggles of raising teenagers and watching her girls prepare to venture out into the world. ""I'd like to be remembered for being a good mom,"" Coleman says. ""I'd rather be remembered for that than being a prisoner-of-war.""","Melissa Coleman spent 33 days as a prisoner of war during the first Gulf war .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- India set the stage for a new wave of competition in its booming telecom industry Thursday as it allowed its 750 million mobile users to change operators without losing their existing cellphone numbers. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh launched the mobile number portability (MNP) service, a facility that he said would cost a subscriber as less as Rs. 19 or 41 cents. ""Today's occasion marks a very important milestone in the evolution of telecommunications in our country,"" Singh said. Home to 1.2 billion people, India has made rapid strides in telecommunications in the last decade. The nation's mobile subscriber base has now swollen to around 750 million from a mere 33 million in 2004, Singh said. About 15 million new users are added each month, he added. ""More of our countrymen have been touched by this revolution than by any other program, product or service in the history of our nation and that too at a pace unprecedented in the world at large,"" Singh said. Not too long ago -- until India unleashed economic reforms in the 1990s -- Indians had to wait for years to get landline connections at their homes and businesses from state-run telephone companies. Today, a number of private players are locked in stiff price wars as they jostle for a pie in what is now billed as the world's fastest-growing telecom market. ""(The) implementation of (the) MNP will not only give wider choices to the Indian subscribers but will also compel service providers to offer innovative, affordable and competitive tariff plans for the benefit of the masses,"" said the country's telecommunications ministry. Ironically though, one of the worst corruption scandals to have hit India in recent times is also linked to the same lucrative sector. Singh has come under intense attack from opposition lawmakers after a government audit reported the treasury lost up to $31 billion from below-price sale of second-generation wireless spectrum in 2008. The alleged scam has forced the country's telecom minister, A. Raja, to step down. Raja, a member of a key regional ally of Singh's Congress party, denies the charges. Singh insists wrongdoers will be punished.","India's mobile subscriber base has swollen to about 750 million, Singh says .

"PARIS, France (CNN)  -- Al Qaeda threatened to ""take revenge"" on France ""by every means and wherever we can reach them"" because of a debate in France over whether the burqa, a traditional Islamic woman's covering, violates French law, according to a statement posted on radical Islamist Web sites. A woman wears traditionnal Muslim dress in Venissieux, near Lyon, France. ""We will not tolerate such provocations and injustices, and we will take our revenge from France,"" said the statement, signed by Abu Musab Abdul Wadud, calling himself ""commander of al Qaeda in North Africa [Islamic Maghreb]."" The statement is dated June 28, five days after French President Nicolas Sarkozy controversially told lawmakers that the traditional Muslim garment was ""not welcome"" in France. A day later, the French National Assembly announced the creation of an inquiry into whether women in France should be allowed to wear the garment. A cross-party panel of 32 lawmakers will investigate whether the burqa poses a threat to the secular nature of the French constitution. They are due to report back with their recommendations in six months. The al Qaeda statement accused France of ""organizing its ranks to fight a new blatant war against our sisters wearing the burqa."" CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the statement, which also accused the French of ""committing all of these grievances in a time when we see their women flooding our nations, filling our shores, poorly dressed and nude in a deliberate defiance to the feelings of Muslims and in clear contempt to the teachings of the Islamic faith, traditions and norms."" ""Our Muslim brothers in France in particular and in Europe in general are increasingly troubled by the practices of the French politicians and their leaders, and their constant harassments of our people regarding the burqa issue,"" said the statement. ""Yesterday they targeted the veil, today the burqa and maybe tomorrow their evil hands could be extended to defame our pillars of faith, like praying, fasting or the pilgrimage,"" it added. Sarkozy made the statement last week, in an address to parliament. ""The problem of the burqa is not a religious problem. This is an issue of a woman's freedom and dignity. This is not a religious symbol. It is a sign of subservience; it is a sign of lowering. I want to say solemnly, the burqa is not welcome in France,"" Sarkozy said. The right of Muslim women to cover themselves is fiercely debated in France, which has a significant Muslim minority but also a staunchly secular constitution. In 2004, the French parliament passed legislation banning Muslim girls from wearing head scarves in state schools, prompting widespread Muslim protests. The law also banned other conspicuous religious symbols including Sikh turbans, large Christian crucifixes and Jewish skull caps. Last year, France's top court denied a Moroccan woman's naturalization request on the grounds that she wore a burqa. Between 5 and 10 percent of France's population of 64 million is Muslim, according to CIA estimates. The country does not collect its own statistics on religion in accordance with laws enshrining France's status as a secular state. France is not the only European Union country to consider banning the burqa. Dutch lawmakers voted in favor of a ban in 2005, although the government at the time left office before legislation could be passed.","Threatening statement posted on radical Islamic Web sites .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- CNN followed two die-hard football fans as they traveled to Rome to watch their teams battle to become champions of Europe. Ivan Papell partied until the early hours after seeing Barcelona win the champions League final. Ivan Papell is a Barcelona fan and managing director of the Spanish arm of a multinational company. He is in high spirits today after seeing his team beat Manchester United 2-0, but confesses to being a little tired. He didn't make it to bed until six o'clock this morning after partying the night away with thousands of other Barcelona fans, . ""It was a great night for Barcelona, but I've lost my voice from screaming,"" he told CNN. Manchester United fan Geoff Pearson is a Lecturer in Law at the University of Liverpool in England and lives in Manchester. He traveled to Moscow to see his team beat Chelsea in last year's Champions League final, but United were unable to repeat their success last night. ""We were outplayed, apart from for the first 10 minutes of the match,"" he admits. His match ticket cost him $106, but that only accounts for a small part of his expenses. Pearson couldn't get tickets for a direct flight to Rome -- instead, he had to fly to Milan, then hire a car and drive to Rome, where he stayed for three nights. In total, traveling to the final cost him about $750, but he does not regret making the journey. Manchester United fan Geoff Pearson doesn't regret traveling to Rome, despite seeing his team lose. ""The atmosphere at the match was brilliant,"" he told CNN. ""The Manchester United fans did themselves proud. They outnumbered the Barcelona fans and made more noise."" How much have you paid to see your team play abroad? Sound Off below . While Pearson was impressed by the atmosphere inside Rome's Stadio Olimpico, he says he and other traveling Manchester United fans had difficulty getting to the match. He says the fans' bus was delayed up by police and that there was a crush to get through the turnstiles into the stadium, putting it down to ""the usual chaos of Italian away matches."" Papell had no such trouble getting to the game and, sitting with Manchester United fans, he says he was impressed by their sporting behavior. He says that many United fans congratulated him after the match, telling him Barcelona had deserved to win. After seeing Barcelona beat the reigning European Champions Papell was justifiably proud of his team's performance. ""Barcelona were lucky to have scored first, but after that it was the sort of match Barcelona wanted. Manchester United were always behind the ball and Barcelona dominated the game,"" he said. ""I was expecting more from Manchester United but Barcelona can play the ball very fast and they make it hard for other teams."" While Papell catches up on some sleep, Pearson has to catch a train to Milan this afternoon, before flying back to England tomorrow morning. ""It was definitely worth it,"" he said. ""It was a European final and they don't come round every year."" But if the United and Barcelona do make it to next year's final, Pearson and Pappell will no doubt be in Madrid to cheer them on.","Fans Geoff and Ivan traveled to Rome to see the Champions League final .

"Washington (CNN) -- The White House will announce a new economic advisory council on Friday, one that will be headed by Jeffrey Immelt, the CEO and chairman of General Electric. ""Because we still have a long way to go to get Americans back to work and strengthen our economy, the President will announce on Friday that he will sign a new Executive Order creating a new board, the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, which will have a new composition and new mission as we move to a new phase in our economic recovery,"" a White House statement said. ""The Council will focus on finding new ways to promote growth by investing in American business to encourage hiring, to educate and train our workers to compete globally, and to attract the best jobs and businesses to the United States."" The council replaces the old Economic Recovery Advisory Board that was headed by Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. ""President Obama has asked me to chair his new President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness,"" Immelt said in a Washington Post op-ed piece published Friday. ""I have served for the past two years on the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, and I look forward to leading the next phase of this effort as we transition from recovery to long-term growth. ""The president and I are committed to a candid and full dialogue among business, labor and government to help ensure that the United States has the most competitive and innovative economy in the world,"" he said. ""Jeff Immelt's experience at GE and his understanding of the vital role the private sector plays in creating jobs and making America competitive makes him up to the challenge of leading this new Council,"" President Barack Obama said in a statement. ""I also want to thank my friend Paul Volcker, whose service not just during this difficult period but for decades has been invaluable to me and the American people."" The development is the latest in a series of economic policy moves made by the White House in the new year. Two weeks ago, the president tapped Treasury aide Gene Sperling as the new director of the National Economic Council. Sperling, who succeeds economist Larry Summers as head of the council, currently is a counselor to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. Among other things, he helped lead the administration's tax negotiations with congressional Republicans during December's lame-duck session of Congress. Sperling also headed the National Economic Council during the Clinton administration. Top Democrats are pointing to Obama's decision to have him head the council as another sign the president is leaning more heavily on Clinton-era veterans as he starts working with a divided Congress. Obama also named Clinton Commerce Secretary Bill Daley as his new chief of staff this month. The U.S. economy continues to try to dig itself out of the job losses created by the recession that began in 2008. In its most-recent unemployment report, the Labor Department said the U.S. economy added 103,000 jobs in December, while the unemployment rate fell from 9.8% to 9.4%. Obama noted that there have now been 12 months of private-sector job growth for the first time since 2006. A CNN/Opinion Research poll shows at least three-quarters of Americans consider economic conditions to be somewhat poor or very poor. CNN's Greg Clary contributed to this report.","The White House creates the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness .

"(CNN) -- Former Inter Milan striker Adriano has revealed he had to leave the Italian Serie A giants because of alcohol problems. Brazili striker Adriano is now enjoying his football again after returning home to play for Flamengo. The Brazilian ended his contract with Inter by mutual consent in April after a torrid eight years at the San Siro. Adriano returned to his homeland and signed for Flamengo and the 27-year-old claims he now feels like a new person. ""After the death of my father I fell into a depression that I only managed to cure with alcohol,"" Adriano told Brazilian magazine R7. ""I was happy only when I was drinking and I never stopped. I went out every night and drank whatever happened to be in front of me: wine, whisky, beer...a lot of beer. ""People think that it was madness to give up the millionaire's contract that I had but the truth is that there is not money enough to compensate for family. I gave up so many millions but I bought happiness."" Adriano had a troubled time in Italy and his career was often called into question by off-the-field reports. In September 2007, he was sent home to Brazil by Inter as he was unhappy, and he went on to join Sao Paulo on loan for six months before heading back to Italy. Reports at the time suggested Adriano was once again turning up to training drunk and the Brazil international has admitted that was why the Nerazzurri eventually gave up on him. He continued: ""I turned up every day drunk. I couldn't sleep for fear of being late but at the end I arrived in unpresentable conditions anyway and so they used to send me to sleep in the infirmary while they told journalists that I had some muscle problems. ""I went back to Inter because of coach Jose Mourinho, but it was not enough. I started again with parties, women and alcohol. ""The club didn't want to accept the situation and gave up insisting on my recovery. I'm upset for Mourinho, who rightly argued with several directors in an attempt to convince them to treat me.""","Former Inter Milan striker Adriano has revealed why he left the Italian giants .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- English football clubs have always attracted wealthy owners. Traditionally, club chairmen were bluff local businessmen with a few spare millions in the bank, perhaps looking to put something back into their local community, somewhere to schmooze clients and colleagues, and seduced by the idea of being a player -- albeit at boardroom level -- in a sport that is an obsession for millions. Long-suffering City fans overnight saw their club transformed into one of the world's wealthiest. But this week's purchase of Manchester City by an Abu Dhabi-based consortium from the controversial former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra provided further proof that the English Premier League has become an altogether different ball game, attracting an altogether different caliber of super-rich investor. For decades City have lived in the shadows of local rivals Manchester United. While United are one of the world's most famous clubs and current champions of England and Europe, it is now more than 40 years since the last of City's two league titles. City followers have long sought solace in the hackneyed idea that all United supporters are glory hunters while they represent the true spirit of long suffering, gray-skied Mancunian fandom. Yet now City supporters find themselves following a club capable overnight of breaking the British transfer record in an audacious $58 million swoop for the highly-rated Brazilian Robinho, formerly of Real Madrid, and with aspirations of both out-spending and out-playing their red-shirted rivals. ""We are going to be the biggest club in the world, bigger than both Real Madrid and Manchester United,"" multi-billionaire property tycoon Sulaiman al-Fahim, the public face of the Abu Dhabi United Group for Development and Investment which has taken over City, declared in an interview Monday with Arabian Business magazine. ""This is like all their Christmases come at once,"" World Soccer magazine's Kier Radnedge told CNN. ""Manchester City have been a great soap opera over the years; lots of hope, lots of dreams and really very little to celebrate and cheer along the way. All of a sudden, out of the blue, it seems as if they really can compete with Manchester United and that is really all their fans have ever wanted to do.""  Watch why the sky is now the limit for the Blues Â» . Middle Eastern football expert James Montague, author of ""When Friday Comes: Football in the War Zone,"" sees the Abu Dhabi's group's purchase of Manchester City as an attempt to steal a march on rival emirate Dubai, which has itself been linked with a move for City's Premier League rivals Liverpool. ""There is an almost messianic love of Premiership football in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries,"" Montague told CNN.com. ""But this move isn't about profit, or business acumen. This is about prestige. For the Abu Dhabi group, which is basically a consortium of the emirate's royal family, this is more about putting their flag in the sand and putting Abu Dhabi -- and the United Arab Emirates -- on the map."" In recent seasons English football has become a billionaire's playground with foreign owners drawn to the game by the global success, international exposure and financial strength of the Premier League. Accountants Deloitte estimate that the combined revenue of the Premier League's 20 clubs for the 2007-08 season from television rights, gate receipts and global marketing will reach Â£1.9 billion ($3.4 billion). The financial landscape of English football was transformed in 2003 when Russian oil tycoon Roman Abramovich bought west London club Chelsea and bankrolled them to back-to-back Premier League titles under the leadership of Jose Mourinho. Since then other clubs have followed foreign money in an effort to compete. Manchester United are now controlled by the family of U.S. sports magnate Malcolm Glazer while Liverpool are co-owned by American pair George Gillett and Tom Hicks. Elsewhere in the Premier League, Aston Villa, Portsmouth, Fulham and West Ham all have foreign owners while the trend has also spread to lower league clubs. Last year London side Queen's Park Rangers were bought by Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone, Renault F1 team chief Flavio Briatore and steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal. But not all supporters have welcomed the transformation of clubs rooted in local communities into multinational businesses. A core of Manchester United fans have bitterly opposed the Glazers' involvement at Old Trafford, going as far as forming a breakaway club called FC United of Manchester. At Liverpool meanwhile, where relations between Gillett and Hicks have soured amid continuing rumors that the club will be sold to a Dubai investment group, supporters have launched a campaign -- ShareLiverpoolFC -- to buy the club themselves, attracting interest from thousands of fans. ""Clubs like Liverpool -- and there are many others -- feel like family to those who love and support them,"" Rogan Taylor, a lifelong Liverpool fan and founder of the Football Supporters' Association, wrote in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper. ""The biggest may have international brands, which accounts for their attraction to multinational investors; but at heart the brand is their fans and the history of their club. It can never really belong to anyone else."" Yet many fans appear happy enough to see foreign investment coming into their clubs if it means better players, better football and success on the field. At City that is likely to mean ""fireworks"" when the transfer window reopens in January, according to Montague. ""Abu Dhabi is so awash with cash, they have difficulty spending it all,"" he said. ""They will turn the transfer market on its head. They've already smashed the British transfer record with Robinho and have targeted the six biggest players in the world with a transfer kitty of $400 million.""","Abu Dhabi investment group agree takeover deal for Manchester City .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- On the court they have unparalleled balance, grace and power. Unfortunately, for too many NBA stars, life away from the game can be a far trickier proposition. On target: Desmond Mason was one of the stars on the program. This can be particularly the case when it comes to money, despite the stratospheric salaries on offer, currently averaging more than $5 million a year, higher than in any other U.S. sport. Some players, it seems, are as adept at signing checks as they are shooting hoops. A report earlier this year cited an internal NBA Player's Association (NBPA) study as showing that more than half ex-basketball pros are broke within five years of retirement, many struggling to maintain expensive lifestyles without the regular salary payments to match. But now one business school hopes to help at least some of the current crop of NBA stars become as business savvy as they are athletic. Illinois-based Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management has just hosted its first intake of basketball stars for a four-day executive education program covering topics including business leadership, negotiations, brand building and investing. Jointly developed by the NBPA, the scheme follows a similar program, run for several years by Kellogg and several other schools, which teach business skills to NFL stars (covered previously on Executive Education). While their team mates enjoyed some downtime in the summer off season -- or at least those who weren't winning the men's Olympic basketball gold in Beijing -- players including Quentin Richardson of the New York Knicks, Desmond Mason of the Milwaukee Bucks and Jeff Foster of the Indiana Pacers headed to the classroom for sessions with some of Kellogg's top professors. ""It sounds kind of boring, but it's really not,"" Richardson said afterward. ""There's a lot of interaction and discussion."" ""As pro athletes, we're approached all the time with people saying, 'You can do this or that, just give me the money.' Now maybe we'll be a little better equipped to handle the situation, to know whether the person is serious or not, or whether they have really thought it through to see if it really makes sense."" Mindful of the fact that the average professional basketball career lasts less than five years, the program is intended to both make the most of their earnings while they play and also consider what they might to subsequently. ""We realize that business education is helpful in preparing a person for a career move, especially for professional athletes,"" said Steve Rogers, professor of entrepreneurship at the school, who devised the syllabus, adding that the course does not ""dumb anything down"" for the sports stars. ""The program is optional for these NBA players, so their commitment level is high and they want to learn these business principles."" Rogers now hopes to devise similar programs for other pro sports players in hockey, auto racing and other fields.","New business school program teaches business to NBA stars .

"(CNN) -- Titleholders Inter Milan will take on Bayern Munich in the last 16 of the Champions League after Friday's draw produced a repeat of last season's final. Italian side Inter went into the pot knowing that a tie with one of Europe's top sides was likely after qualifying for the knockout stages in second place in Group A behind Tottenham. ""It's an interesting draw,"" Inter chairman Massimo Moratti told the club's official website. ""We've faced Bayern Munich lots of times in the past, it's almost a traditional fixture."" Rafael Benitez's side will have home advantage for the first leg, which will be played in February, while the trip to Germany will take place in March. Bayern, beaten 2-0 in May's final when Jose Mourinho was in charge of Inter, have struggled in the Bundesliga but topped Group E with five wins from six matches. ""Inter is an extremely tough draw. Probably the most difficult draw open to us,"" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told the club's website. ""But it's also a very appealing draw for us. This is now our chance to take revenge."" Barcelona will play English club Arsenal in a repeat of the 2006 final and last season's quarterfinals, both of which were won by the Spanish champions. ""Difficult but possible,"" was Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger's reaction to the draw. ""I didn't want anybody really, all teams would have been difficult,"" he told his club's official website. ""Barcelona are certainly the favorites but they did not want us either because they know they will get a game."" Barca's Spanish rivals Real Madrid have the chance to avenge last season's second-round defeat by French club Lyon, who went on to reach the semifinals. Mourinho will seek to take his expensively-assembled team past the last-16 stage for the first time since 2004 as Real bid for a 10th title. Madrid legend Emilio Butragueno, who was present at the draw, believes his former club will reach the later stages of the competition this year. ""This is a cruel but thrilling competition. We drew Lyon and must accept it,"" he said on Real's website. ""We must be very focused. We are more than capable of making the quarterfinals."" English club Tottenham's reward for finishing top in Group A in their first appearance in the competition is another trip to Italy to face AC Milan. The Serie A leaders, who finished second behind Real in Group G, are seeking an eighth title, having last won it in 2007. Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp described the match as a ""great challenge."" ""I said before the draw that I wouldn't mind playing AC Milan,"" he told the London side's website. ""You want to take on the best teams in the world, and that's what the fans want to see as well."" Three-time champions Manchester United will travel to France next month for the first leg against 1993 winners Marseille. Manager Alex Ferguson told the United website it would be a ""difficult tie"". ""Marseille are a handful at their own ground, their fantastic atmosphere and incredible support guarantees that. They've had a good change in fortunes in the last two or three years,"" he said. English rivals Chelsea, who also topped their group, will face Copenhagen -- the first Danish team to reach the knockout stages after finishing second in Group D behind Barcelona. But Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay said the Premier League champions would not underestimate their opponents. ""'There's no easy games at this stage and we'll be very careful,"" he told the club's website. Shakhtar Donetsk will also face a last-16 tie for the first time after topping Group H ahead of Arsenal, and the Ukrainian side will travel to the Italian capital to play AS Roma in next month's first leg.

"(CNN) -- Mexico bounced back from two successive defeats to beat Trinidad and Tobago 2-1 on Wednesday and keep alive hopes of qualifying for the 2010 World Cup finals. Mexico's match-winner Oscar Rojas tussles with Trinidad and Tobago's goalscorer Hayden Tinto. The result lifted the Mexicans up to fourth place in the six-team CONCACAF group, from which only the top three nations automatically progress to next year's showpiece in South Africa. If Javier Aguirre's side cannot do any better than the position they find themselves at the halfway stage of the qualifying schedule, then a two-leg play-off against the fifth-best team from the South American group will follow. Mexico, on six points, are one behind third-placed Honduras, who defeated El Salvador 1-0 on Wednesday thanks to a 14th-minute winner from Carlos Pavon. Aguirre experienced a much more positive result than his first match in charge, a 2-1 defeat away to El Salvador on Saturday. In Mexico City, Guillermo Franco gave the hosts a perfect start when he cut in from the right and beat goalkeeper Clayton Ince. However, Hayden Tinto made Mexico pay for missing several chances when he pounced on a defensive mistake and fired into the top corner on the stroke of halftime. But Oscar Rojas netted a long-range winner three minutes after the interval to leave the bottom-placed Soca Warriors with just two draws from five outings. Costa Rica top the group on 12 points, two ahead of the United States.","Mexico bounce back from two successive defeats to beat Trinidad and Tobago .

"(CNN) -- Kim Clijsters has regained the WTA Tour Championship title, seven years after last winning it, after a hard-fought three-set victory over Caroline Wozniacki in Doha, Qatar on Sunday. Belgian Clijsters, who was lifting the trophy for a third time following back-to-back wins in 2002 and 2003, beat world number one Wozniacki 6-3 5-7 6-3 in a thrilling two hour and 20 minute clash. It marked a remarkable return for 27-year-old Clijsters, who was appearing in her first tournament since retaining her U.S. Open title seven weeks ago, following a foot operation. Is Wozniacki a worthy world number one? ""It was a very tough battle, and I think it was a fine advert for women's tennis,"" Clijsters told reporters. ""I'm glad I won but I don't know how many more years I will play --and I think Caroline has a great future ahead of her,"" added Clijsters. Dane Wozniacki, who will end the year as number one following six WTA Tour titles this season, said: ""It was still a fantastic week for me. ""I would love to come back here, and I would love to try for this title once again."" Meanwhile, Sunday saw three ATP Tour finals take place around Europe with home favorite Gael Monfils claiming his third career title with a 6-2 5-7 6-1 win over Croatia's Ivan Ljubicic in the final of the inaugural Montpellier tournament. World number 15 Monfils has been beaten in both of his two previous final appearances this year, in Stuttgart and Tokyo. Elsewhere, top seed and world number 12 Jurgen Melzer fought back from the brink of defeat to see off fellow-Austrian Andreas Haider-Maurer 6-7 7-6 6-4 to win the Austria Tennis Trophy in Vienna for the second year in a row. And there was a surprise in the final of the St Petersburg Open in Russia when unseeded Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan shocked top seed Mikhail Youzhny to win his maiden ATP title. The 22-year-old from Astana completed a 6-3 7-6 victory after two hours and 25 minutes of play.","Kim Clijsters regains the WTA Tour Championship title after beating Caroline Wozniacki .

"(CNN Student News) -- August 19, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . â¢ Pakistan â¢ South Africa â¢ Georgia . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Well, you've made it to Thursday. I'm Carl Azuz. This is CNN Student News! Your hearing: Listen up, 'cause we're gonna be talking about that in just a bit. We start off today, though, in Pakistan. First Up: Pakistan Aid . AZUZ: Severe flooding has left 20 percent -- one fifth -- of the country underwater, and officials are worried about the threat of disease. A lot of the victims are walking through dirty flood waters, and that can lead to the spread of things like cholera or typhoid. Experts are estimating that as many as 3.5 million children are at risk of getting sick. Of course, the most immediate concern is aid: food, medical supplies. The United Nations has asked for $460 million from the international community. Only about half of that has been raised so far. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is expected to announce today that the United States will be sending more aid to Pakistan. Sara Sidner has more on the relief efforts. SARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We're here off the shores of Karachi on the USS Peleliu with the Expeditionary Strike Group 5. It is their whole mission to make sure to be available when there is some sort of disaster. They patrol these waters, and they were in the area to help those in the flood zones in Pakistan. They've been able to get about 5,000 people out of those flood zones, rescuing them with helicopters. They've also been able to drop about a half million pounds of aid. They say they will be here for as long as it takes. There are more helicopters coming in; there are more ships coming in. The U.S. says that it has a humanitarian commitment that they're going to make to Pakistan. They've already given about $90 million in kind. But the U.N. continually saying that there is simply not enough aid being offered to this country. South Africa Strike . AZUZ: More international news for you now, our next story taking us to South Africa, the country that hosted the World Cup this past summer. If you watched any of that, you saw huge crowds of people. And the nation's streets are crowded again. This time, it's with South African workers who are on strike. People who work in the public sector -- hospital employees, teachers, federal workers -- walked off the job all across South Africa yesterday. Organizers have threatened that this strike will go on indefinitely. They want the government to give them more pay and better benefits. South African officials say those demands just can't be met right now. They're worried about the impact of this nationwide strike, though. They claim it could end up hurting the entire country, including the very people who are protesting. What's the Word . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: What's the word? a man-made item from an older time period . It's an ARTIFACT. That's the word! Civil War Discovery . AZUZ: Artifacts aren't always big or spectacular. Sometimes simple items, like a button or fork, those can be important, too. They can offer clues about a culture, a civilization we didn't know much about before. In fact, some scientists think a huge collection of artifacts that was recently discovered in the state of Georgia could offer clues about what life was like in a Civil War prison camp. Camp Lawton: If you haven't heard of that, you're not alone. It's not very well known because it was only open for six weeks. But recently, a group of college students found it, and they found hundreds of artifacts from prisoners there. Buttons, bullets, coins, a pipe. Some of these artifacts will go on display soon. And the reason why experts think this finding is so significant is that the site barely seems to have been touched. A lot of Civil War sites get torn up by people hunting for relics; not so at Camp Lawton. Is This Legit? APRIL WILLIAMS, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? Your ear is part of your olfactory system. Not legit! It's part of your auditory system, your sense of hearing. Hearing Loss Study . AZUZ: Well, that sense may be getting worse, especially for you all. And as somebody who played the drums in middle and high school, I sympathize with you. There's a new study out about 12 to 19 year olds. It found that the number of teens who suffer from early signs of hearing loss is going up dramatically. We want you to look at these statistics; they're pretty surprising. Back in 1994, around one in every 20 teens had some kind of hearing loss. By 2006, that number was up to one in every 5. That means about 6.5 million teens experience hearing loss. So the next question is, why? What is causing this increase? Researchers say that's what they need to focus on in the future. One of the authors of this study, though, was asked if technology might be part of the reason. DR. JOSEF SHARGORODSKY, BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL: Is it the iPod? From our study, in specific, it is actually -- we cannot say what the cause is of this increase from our data. Of course, the world around us is getting louder. You can stand in a busy intersection in New York, for example, and get sound levels that are dangerously high if you are exposed to it for a prolonged period of time. You can also get it from driving in a convertible on the highway. And so, of course, teenagers are using headphones and are using portable music devices now that they have not been using previously. And so, that's certainly one possibility. New Orleans Rising . AZUZ: Five years ago this month, Hurricane Katrina slammed into America's Gulf Coast region. ""New Orleans Rising"" -- a new CNN documentary -- tells the story of one neighborhood's struggle to rebuild after the storm. The program airs on CNN this Saturday and Sunday at 8 p.m. Eastern. And CNN Student News has put together a teacher and parent guide to go along with the show. You can find them in the Spotlight section at CNNStudentNews.com. Blackout Danger . AZUZ: When the power goes out, a lot of times it's because of that huge lightning storm outside your window. If lightning hits a power line, you're in the dark. But there are times when it seems like blackouts happen when there isn't a single cloud in sight. Allan Chernoff sheds some light on why some of us could see more days in the dark. (BEGIN VIDEO) ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT, NEW YORK: Sizzling temperatures as much of a strain on the power system as on the public. Why does the power system always strain when the temperature soars? It's our electricity grid system, which was not designed for today's demands. Matthew Cordaro, a former chief executive of two power companies, warns that the system is at risk. MATTHEW CORDARO, ENERGY EXPERT: We are nowhere near where we have absolute certainty that we can avoid a major outage or a disturbance. It's not that it will happen every day, but indeed a strong possibility that that could occur. CHERNOFF: When the heat is on and air conditioners are on full blast to fight it, power demand can overburden circuits and transformers that allow electricity to travel from power plants across transmission lines and into your home. ARSHAD MANSOOR, ELECTRIC POWER RESEARCH INST.: The circuits and the transformers, they don't have the time to cool down, so they get overloaded. An overloaded circuit could cause an outage. CHERNOFF: President Obama, aware of the problem, last year committed $3.5 billion in stimulus money to modernize the grid. But it is only about two percent of what the power industry would have to invest for a smart grid. And much of the government money has yet to be spent. New York's Con Edison recently put off a plan to install smart grid equipment in part of Manhattan. It's a disappointment to a Massachusetts company that supplies high capacity power cables, superconductors that can protect against dangerous power surges. JASON FREDETTE, AMERICAN SUPERCONDUCTOR CORP.: Superconductors are a key component of those smart grids in Korea, in China. And here in the U.S., we need to do the same thing, and we urgently need to update our grid. CHERNOFF: Smart grid technology would allow utilities to see precise, real-time demand from every customer, so they could take action to minimize the risk of an outage. But most power companies have only just begun such an upgrade. In fact, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation says that two regions are especially vulnerable: Colorado, suffering from drought conditions that are reducing power output from the Hoover Dam power plant; and south central Louisiana, where transmission lines need upgrades to improve reliability. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: And finally today, we're gonna go ahead and call in the B-team. Yes, that is a pun. All 50,000 members of the B-team. You know they work well together; you've had honey before. This time, they teamed up to trap a police officer inside his car for 3 hours! Officer is totally fine. But can you imagine being trapped in your car by bees in the summer heat? You know that's gotta be swarm. Eventually, some experts came out to box up the bees and free the deputy. Goodbye . AZUZ: Which put an end to this arresting development. Arres-sting: That's a two-for-one! You can't beee-at that. Next time, they should just call out the swat unit! Okay, we'll buzz off. But just 'til tomorrow. If you watched CNN Student News last year, you know that Fridays are awesome. I'm Carl Azuz. We will see you then.

"(CNN)  -- North Korea qualified for the 2010 World Cup finals for the first time since 1966 by battling to a 0-0 draw away to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday night. North Korea have qualified for the World Cup for the first time since 1966. The point captured in searing temperatures in Riyadh, saw the Koreans edge into second place in Asian qualifying Group 2 to finish ahead of Saudi Arabia on goal difference and seal their place in the finals. It means both group winners South Korea, who co-hosted the World Cup with Japan in 2002, and neighbors North Korea will  play in the 2010 showpiece in South Africa. North Korea coach Kim Yong-Jun Kim had nothing but praise for his players after the final whistle. ""We focused on the defending as we had come under a lot of pressure from the Saudis and I think our preparation for the game was one factor that earned the victory tonight,"" the North Korean boss told FIFA's official Web site. ""We monitored the Saudi team from the beginning of our campaign and I noticed that they have a problem in finding good strikers. We battled to qualify for the  World Cup finals and I would like to thank my players for the great performance that they showed during the whole match,"" added Kim. ""It was so hot in Saudi Arabia and as you know the journey from Korea was long but our belief in the ability of the players snatched the ticket to South Africa,"" Kim stated. The booking of North Korea's ticket to the finale will see the reclusive nation compete against the world's best despite growing international political concern regarding Pyongyang's testing of a nuclear bomb recently. Their form in the tournament is one of upsetting the odds after they Italy 43 years ago en route to the quarter-finals. The home draw sees Saudi Arabia finish in third place to go into the playoffs where they will face Bahrain. The winners will play New Zealand for a place in the finals, while Iran miss out after finishing fourth in Group 2. Earlier on Wednesday, they were denied a victory in Seoul as Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-Sung scored a late equalizer to give South Korea a 1-1 draw. Iran took the lead from an own goal early in the second half against the group winners, but Park popped up to score a brilliant 81st minute goal as he beat several men before firing home. In Group 1, Tim Cahill scored twice as Australia came from behind to beat Japan 2-1 to clinch top spot in the section. The result was academic as both teams had already sealed automatic qualification for the World Cup finals in South Africa. Japan went ahead in front of a big crowd of nearly 70,000 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) as Marcus Tulio Tanaka headed home a Kengo Nakamura corner in the 40th minute. But the Socceroos, who went through qualifying unbeaten, hit back in the second half. Everton's attacking midfielder Cahill again worked his scoring magic to secure the victory. He was on target in the 59th and 76th minutes to take his tally to 16 in 33 internationals. ""This is a step forward for us, it's great to finish top of the group,"" Cahill told FIFA.com after the win, while captain Lucas Neill paid tribute to their opponents. ""They really played the game with intensity and they were running us ragged for a bit and we couldn't get ourselves in the game,"" Neill said. Bahrain later clinched third spot in the group and their playoff spot with a 1-0 win over Uzbekistan. A 74th minute goal from Mahmood Abdulrahman from a free kick gave his side a crucial three points.","North Korea qualify from Group 2 with 0-0 draw against Saudi Arabia .

"(CNN) -- Samantha Stosur stopped Caroline Wozniacki from clinching the year-end women's No. 1 tennis ranking with a shock 6-4 6-3 victory at the WTA Championships in Qatar on Wednesday night. The Australian romped to her second straight victory in the Maroon Group, following her revenge win over French Open champion Francesca Schiavone on Tuesday. The Roland Garros runner-up's kick serve was a potent weapon against Wozniacki, with the triumph giving the 26-year-old every chance of reaching the semifinals ahead of her final group match against Russia's Elena Dementieva on Thursday. It was her second victory over a top-ranked player this year, having beaten Serena Williams on the way to reaching the final in Paris. The fifth seed fired 26 winners to Wozniacki's 14, and could afford to serve two double-faults in the deciding game before the Dane returned a backhand long on her first match-point. Wozniacki, who thrashed seventh seed Dementieva on Tuesday, will next take on Italy's Schiavone on Thursday. Kim Clijsters, who won the $4.5 million season-ending event in 2002 and 2003, earlier triumphed in her opening White Group match 6-2 6-3 against fellow former No. 1 Jelena Jankovic despite serving 10 double-faults. The Belgian, returning to action after having a mole cut off her foot, broke Jankovic to love in the first game of the match and then again in the seventh. The three-time U.S. Open champion was less impressive in the second set but had enough to see off the Serbian, who is struggling with illness in the oppressive heat in Doha. ""It wasn't my best tennis, but it was good enough. I felt I did a lot of good things, and there are a few things I need to tweak. The more matches I get, the better it will go,"" said Clijsters, who plays eighth seed Victoria Azarenka on Thursday. Azarenka was disappointed after squandering a great chance to upset second-seeded Russian Vera Zvonareva, with the Belarusian losing 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 in the day's first match despite leading by a break in both sets. ""I had a lot of chances and was very unlucky in some moments. There were like one million nets from her side,"" Sunday's Kremlin Cup champion told the event's official website. ""It's part of the game though. I think I played a good match and I'm still in the group -- I still have chances to play further. I'm going to keep fighting and trying to do my best. ""It's very humid here. Sometimes your racquet just slips out of your hands. It's the same conditions for everybody, but I had less time to prepare than anybody else. I'm still happy to be here and I have to regroup from today."" It was Zvonareva's second successive win, following her victory over Jankovic on Tuesday, and she is the only player in the eight-woman field who can overtake the 20-year-old Wozniacki in the rankings. ""It's maybe one of the longest straight-set matches I've ever played. We've played so many times before, I'm just happy to get through,"" said Zvonareva, who trailed 4-2 in the first set and 3-1 in the second before winning in one hour 45 minutes. Meanwhile, the United States has named former men's No. 1 player Jim Courier as the successor to Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe. The 40-year-old, who twice won the teams event as a player, takes charge ahead of next March's World Group first-round clash with Chile. McEnroe had been captain for 10 years, but stood down last month. The U.S. lost 3-2 to Serbia in the opening round in March.","World No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki beaten by Samantha Stosur at WTA Championships .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Global markets were reeling Monday after a historic day on Wall Street that saw two famous names become the latest victims of the credit crunch. The leading U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and brokerage Merrill Lynch was the subject of a $50 billion buyout by Bank of America. The fate of other big name financial institutions remained in doubt and stock prices plunged in Asia, Europe and the United States. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 504 points down, or about 4.4 percent. The Nasdaq composite lost 3.6 percent, its worst single-session percentage decline since March 24, 2003. It left the tech-fueled average at its lowest point since March 17 of this year. In Europe, FTSE index in London declined 3.92 percent while the Paris CAC 40 was down 3.78 percent. It was the worst day for the index since the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001. Major Asian indexes were closed but India's Sensex fell 5.4 percent, Taiwan's benchmark dropped 4.1, Australia's key index dropped 2 percent and Singapore fell 2.9. Check markets . The turmoil at Merrill Lynch and Lehman is bound to mean job losses in the already hard-hit financial services industry, but so far neither company has indicated how many will be cut. ""This crisis is clearly deeper than anybody had imagined only a short time ago,"" Peter Stein, an associate editor at the Wall Street Journal in Asia, told CNN. The chaos followed a roller-coaster weekend for a Wall Street already concussed by woes at other major financial firms and mortgage-financing titans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Sound off: What do you think? At one point the U.S. Federal Reserve was forced to step in, announcing plans to loosen lending restrictions to the banking industry in an effort to calm markets, while a consortium of 10 leading domestic and foreign banks agreed a $70 billion fund to lend to troubled financial firms. U.S. President George W. Bush said Monday he is confident that the markets are resilient and can deal with the latest financial blows. ""We are working to reduce disruptions and minimize the impact these financial market developments on the broader economy.""  Watch what went wrong Â» . He added: ""In the short run, adjustments in the financial markets can be painful for people worried about their investments and for employees of the firms."" U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said eight years of Bush ""brought us the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression."" His Republican rival said John McCain said he was happy the federal government decided not to use taxpayer dollars to bail out Lehman Brothers. In an effort to calm market jitters, the European Central Bank on Monday said it has pumped $42.6 billion into money markets. The Bank of England in London also took steps, offering nearly $9 billion in a three-day auction. In another development, American International Group, the world's largest insurer, was reportedly struggling to secure billions of dollars in capital after months of seeing its share values slide. Police cordoned off Lehman's headquarters in New York on Sunday as staff, some in suits, others in casual clothes, left the building with cardboard boxes while tourists and onlookers gathered to watch the spectacle. The 158-year-old bank, which has weathered previous financial upheavals and saw its offices destroyed in the September 11 World Trade Center attacks, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which grants protection while it works out a plan to pay back creditors. The collapse of Lehman came after shares declined 94 percent in the space of a year, prompting speculation over its fate. It took a turn for the worse Sunday when Bank of America and British bank Barclays, both viewed as potential ""white knights,"" pulled out of deal talks, sources told CNNMoney.com. Both Lehmans and Merrill have been caught with huge exposures to unsecured mortgages, the bad debts at the heart of the so-called credit crunch that has devalued the U.S. housing market and sent financial shockwaves worldwide. Analysis: Different rules for different names Â» . Lehman's collapse and the sale of Merrill reduces the number of independent firms on Wall Street to two -- Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs -- following the sale of Bear Stearns to JP Morgan at a bargain price earlier this year. ""Acquiring one of the premier wealth management, capital markets and advisory companies is a great opportunity for our shareholders,"" Bank of American Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ken Lewis said in a statement Monday. ""Together our companies are more valuable because of the synergies in our businesses."" Like Lehman, Merrill Lynch has been suffering from bad real estate bets, and its stock price lost 27 percent last week -- shares are down 65 percent this year.  Watch why Bank of America thinks Merrill is the opportunity of a lifetime Â» . Merrill, known for with its famous bull logo, has been an icon of Wall Street and investing. But billions of dollars in losses in the last year due to fallout in the U.S. mortgage market proved too much for the 94-year old firm.

"Teresopolis, Brazil (CNN) -- Leticia Lima was buried up to her neck in mud. Her forehead was crushed and her teeth knocked out. ""I remember my mother shouting, and a loud noise. I hugged my baby tight. That's the last thing I remember,"" she said, lying bandaged in a hospital bed. Her baby and her mother didn't make it. They were among at least 759 people killed after flooding and massive mudslides flattened houses and wiped out entire neighborhoods in hillside towns of Rio de Janeiro state last week. Other states in the South American country have also seen heavy rainfall. Last week, authorities in neighboring Sao Paulo state said 24 people had been killed by flooding. Victims like Leticia Lima repeat stories of loss and survival throughout the Clinical Hospital of Teresopolis -- located in one of the hardest hit cities. ""On the first day, we treated 178 people in less than 12 hours,"" hospital director Rosane Rodrigues Costa said. Liziel Madureira was one of them. He managed to grab his 5-year-old son, but saw half of his family swept away. He then went on to save his neighbor and her three children. ""I would do it all again,"" he said. ""What else could I do?"" His 18-year-old daughter Erica also survived -- by climbing into a refrigerator. ""It shook and shook,"" she said. ""I opened the door and it was floating."" She cried as she recounted the experience, and said the family was still searching for her mother's body. As the rains subside, donations are pouring in from around the country. A gymnasium in Teresopolis is packed with stacks of clothes, water, rice and beans. Residents said they are starting to think about the future. Erica has hope because she made it this far.

"(CNN) -- Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro is rejoining Juventus after three years at Real Madrid, the Serie A club announced on their Web site on Tuesday. Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro won two Primera Liga titles during his three-year stay at Real Madrid. News of Cannavaro's return comes less than 24 hours after the Turin-based club sacked coach Claudio Ranieri and replaced him with former player and youth coach Ciro Ferrara. The 35-year-old Cannavaro was voted world player of the year after leading Italy to World Cup glory in 2006 and has helped Real to achieve two title triumphs during his stay in Spain. Cannavaro was in Italy on Monday for a charity match and told the Juventus Web site: ""I am happy to have returned to Turin and to have the opportunity to wear the black and white jersey again. ""I am sorry that for a section of the fans the anger for having been transferred is greater then the appreciation for the glorious seasons which we lived together. ""I am sure that I can convince the most sceptical through my work, professionalism and the passion with which I will face this new adventure"". Defender Cannavaro won two scudetti with Juventus, in 2005 and 2006, while the side are currently fighting to clinch third place behind champions Inter and their city rivals AC Milan. His one-year contract will come into force as from the start of July and club official Alessio Secco enthused: ""Fabio is a world champion, a golden ball winner and a great team-spirit builder. ""During the Summer of 2006 the club was forced to sell him due to great economic necessities. ""This year we took advantage of the natural expiration of Cannavaro's contract to bring him back to Turin and we are sure that his technical abilities will help Juventus become more competitive"". Cannavaro left Juventus after the club had been relegated to Serie B following the match-fixing allegations that rocked Italian football. He was born in Naples and played for them for three seasons before joining Parma where he won the UEFA Cup and two Italian Cups over a seven year period from 1995. Cannavaro, who has 124 caps for Italy, left Parma to join Inter Milan in 2002 but after only two seasons moved on to Juventus. New coach Ferrara is determined to take Juve straight into next season's Champions League group stage and said on Monday: ""I think the players need to understand that we're in a tight spot. ""They need to rediscover the right motivation to tackle our last two matches with the right attitude. The players need to rediscover their pride and the right motivation.""","Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro rejoining Juve after three years at Real Madrid .

"(CNN) -- Veteran Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar will retire at the end of this season, according to his Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson. Earlier this month United confirmed the signing of Anders Lindegaard from Aalesunds FK, and Ferguson has now admitted the 26-year-old Dane is likely to replace van der Sar as the English club's No. 1 next season. ""We are planning for this being Edwin's last season. But even if he finishes as a player, he might stay at the club because of his knowledge and standing in the game,"" Ferguson told reporters on Thursday. Lindegaard has signed a three-and-a-half-year deal for an undisclosed fee and he will be formally registered in the January transfer window. Ferguson added: ""He is training with us now and that is important. It will bring him to a better level of fitness because he has not played for a few weeks. We will see how his progress goes."" Meanwhile, Aston Villa manager Gerard Houllier has confirmed he will decide on the future of veteran American goalkeeper Brad Friedel in February. The 39-year-old Friedel is close to becoming the oldest player to ever appear for the Premier League club, but his contract expires at the end of the season and Houllier has admitted he is looking for a new custodian.

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- As a symbol of national pride and success, South Korea and Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-Sung, carries more weight on his shoulders than the need to perform. South Korea's Park Ji-Sung celebrates after at the 2006 World Cup  against France. Park, once rejected from his country's own K-League, is now considered the ambassador of Korean football. A responsibility he seems to able carry. ""I want to push my way through Manchester United's star players and put my name on the list of the best 11 team. Park Ji-Sung talks to CNN . ""I want to show the world how good Korean players are by playing well in the top flight,"" Park wrote in his book ""Neverending Challenge"" before he joined United. Park's autobiography, which illustrates his life as a football player since he started out at the age of ten, became a bestseller after being published in 2006. It is no surprise. Park is a celebrity in South Korea and is swamped with fans wherever he goes. His hometown, Suwon, near to Seoul, built a park and named a road after Park to commemorate him becoming the first Premier League-r in South Korean history. Park may even become the first Asian to win a Championship League medal after this season. Nicknamed ""Three-lung Park"" for his seemingly overflowing energy supply, the South Korean papers plaster their front pages with Park if he scores and give out the smallest details of how many minutes he ran in each match. But Park's football career had not really drawn much attention until the recent years. He was mostly unknown to the public until he scored the winning goal to defeat Portugal in the 2002 World Cup in which South Korea reached the semifinals for the first time ever. ""People like him because there's a touching story behind him,"" football commentator Park Moon Sung at SBS, one of Korea's major broadcasters, said. ""They can see how this player, who never really got much attention, is maturing over the years."" The South Korea player, after receiving no calls from the K-League, started his professional career in Japan with Kyoto Purple in 2000. It was only after the 2002 World Cup that he joined PSV Eindhoven and proceeded to join Manchester United in 2005. Park has so far managed to keep his private life out of spotlight, most likely due to his quiet personality, a quality that is also reflected in his performances. ""He's someone who pumps energy into the entire team. He's not like a magician who can save the team from its worst moments with dazzling skills,"" the SBS commentator said. ""It's more like he plays for the others and brings the team together which is something very much needed in a team like Manchester United with all its stars."" Park's joining of Manchester United has enriched the football culture in Korea. Many who started watching European games because of Park have now become avid fans. ""I would like Park Ji-Sung to become a symbol of challenge for all Koreans,"" 30-year-old Kim Young Woo, who is a great fan of Park, said. Kim said he admires Park for never giving up and admits to watching at least 70 percent of all Manchester United games even if it means staying up until three in the morning on weekdays. ""I think young people will look at him and tell themselves that they want to take on challenges, too,"" Kim said. Something Park wants to see as well. The midfielder signed on a deal to build a Park Ji-Sung football center in his hometown fully equipped with training areas and football fields. He believes there should be a better future for Korean football.","Park scored the winning goal against Portugal in the 2002 World Cup .

"Cap-Haitien, Haiti (CNN) -- Haiti reported more cholera deaths Wednesday as chaos reigned in this country's second-largest city, and cases among people who had traveled from Haiti were reported in Florida and the Dominican Republic. At least six people were wounded in related violence in Haiti. Photos: Cholera in Haiti . The cholera-infected woman who had recently traveled from Haiti to Florida was recovering, the Florida Department of Health said. Her case was identified through the state's disease surveillance system and sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, where it was confirmed, the state health department said. Florida, home to about 241,000 Haiti-born residents, has asked local health care providers to watch for people who become sick or show symptoms of cholera after returning from travel to Haiti. ""We are working with our health care partners to ensure appropriate care of this individual and prevent the spread of this disease within the community,"" said State Surgeon General Ana Viamonte Ros. ""We will continue to monitor the state for any future cases."" The first confirmed case in the Dominican Republic was a 32-year-old Haitian construction worker who returned Friday from Haiti with symptoms of the illness, the health ministry said Tuesday night. The man, who was vomiting and had diarrhea, was hospitalized in Higuey, near the eastern resort town of Punta Cana, said Health Minister Bautista Rojas Gomez. The man was in stable condition, according to the newspaper El Nacional. According to data provided by the Caribbean countries, the Dominican Republic is the second-most popular Caribbean destination for American tourists, only behind Cancun, Mexico. More than 900,000 Americans have visited the island through August of this year. However, tourism and public health experts said that at the moment, the risk to tourists in the Dominican Republic were minimal. Neither case was a surprise, said Dr. Jordan Tappero, team leader in Haiti for the CDC in Port-au-Prince. ""CDC has been expecting to see cholera cases elsewhere in the region, including the United States,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. But he said cholera was unlikely to spread widely in the United States or in the Dominican Republic, since both countries have public health infrastructures -- i.e., chlorinated drinking water and intact sewage lines -- that are more robust than those in Haiti. In addition, health officials in the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, have been watching the epidemic spread across Haiti for several weeks, during which they have been preparing by putting into place a surveillance system and educating the populace about what to do if they should come down with symptoms, he said. ""We are very hopeful that the magnitude of the cholera problem in the Dominican Republic will not be on the scale of Haiti,"" Tappero said. ""Diligence in public health messaging and people doing the right thing with water and food preparation and managing waste is going to be critical to that success."" In Haiti, the outbreak had claimed 1,110 lives, the health ministry reported Wednesday. Another 18,382 people had been hospitalized with the disease. The hospital death rate was 4.0 percent, far above the 0.0 to 1.0 percent that infectious disease experts said they expect in developed countries. ""It's telling me that the treatment is not optimal in the hospitals,"" said Dr. Eugene Gangarosa, a professor emeritus at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta. ""It leaves something to be desired."" The risk factors in Haiti make that country ""a perfect storm"" for the disease to spread, Gangarosa said. He cited ""a highly susceptible population, crowding, flawed infrastructure and a virulent strain"" of the bacteria, which the CDC reported this month as having resistance against some drugs commonly used to fight the infection, though other commonly used drugs -- including tetracycline -- are effective against it. Though a vaccine against cholera exists, ""health authorities generally have mixed feelings because it is expensive, it has some serious limitations and mobilizing the population to get the vaccine is problematic,"" Gangarosa said. Aid agencies appealed for calm in the northern port city of Cap-Haitien, where angry demonstrators accused United Nations peacekeepers of starting the outbreak. Residents erected burning barricades, then hid in alleyways and pelted convoys of armored personnel carriers driven by United Nations peacekeepers as they drove past. Cap-Haitien convulsed in a third straight day of violence. At Hopital Universitaire, the city's main hospital, doctors treated a patient with a gunshot wound on Wednesday afternoon. Soon after, wheelbarrows holding two more patients were rolled into the hospital. One man had an apparent bullet wound to the chest, the other a bullet wound through the leg. ""MINUSTAH shot them,"" said a man pushing one of the wheelbarrows and referring to the U.N. forces in Haiti by their acronym. During the night, a medical worker told CNN that the hospital had received three more patients with gunshot wounds. The violence occurred as medical workers struggled to cope with a dramatic increase of patients infected with cholera. At a basketball stadium that has been turned into a makeshift cholera treatment center, Dr. Esther Sterk of the humanitarian group Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF, known in English as Doctors Without Borders) estimated nearly 200 new patients had arrived overnight. At noon, an elderly woman joined the arrivals, her head slumping as she was rolled in a wheelbarrow through the gates of the compound. The stadium was packed with patients on cots, many of them being rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Those patients who did not fit into the main area were being quartered in a hallway underneath the stadium risers. MSF workers said a child died overnight at the stadium. They also said that some patients had been unable to reach the treatment center, their way blocked by protesters who continued to prevent most cars and trucks from traveling the streets of this port city. At one of the burning barricades in the center of town, angry residents chanted in Creole for the United Nations to go away as white U.N. armored-personnel carriers rolled through piles of burning garbage. The United Nations has a peacekeeping force of more than 10,000 foreign police and soldiers deployed in Haiti. The global body has denied Haitian assertions that Nepalese peacekeepers had introduced the cholera bacteria to Haiti. Aid workers said the tense situation on the streets of Cap Haitien was hampering medical and logistical efforts. Aid agencies have suspended clean water projects to slum areas, and canceled flights to deliver soap and other supplies to affected areas, a statement from aid agencies said. Supplies in Cap-Haitien were running out and the medical staff was overwhelmed as cholera mortality numbers climbed, said Nigel Fisher, coordinator for humanitarian action for the United Nations. ""We call upon all involved in these clearly orchestrated demonstrations to stop immediately so national and international partners can continue to save lives with our response to the cholera,"" Fisher said. ""Every day we lose means hospitals go without supplies, patients go untreated and people remain ignorant of the danger they are facing. It is vital that everything possible is done to contain this outbreak in Cap-Haitien while we still can -- but this is very difficult in the current environment."" Stefano Zannini, head of the MSF mission in Haiti, said the organization's medical staff members were able to continue treating patients in Cap-Haitien as they have been for the last 10 days. But, he said, ""it is not an easy environment to work in."" In the capital, Port-au-Prince, Zannini said the number of cases MSF is treating has increased significantly. In the northern slum of Cite Soleil, MSF doctors were seeing 10 times the number of patients than they were seeing last week, he said. MSF has been increasing bed capacity every day and hoped to raise it to 800 by the end of Wednesday, Zannini said. ""It's not enough,"" he said. As capacity rises, so do the number of patients. Meanwhile, the Clinton Foundation announced Wednesday that it has committed $1.5 million for cholera response in Haiti. The foundation said in a news release that it plans to partner with Haiti's health ministry to train 10,000 community public health workers across the country. Also, it will purchase and distribute 10,000 portable treatment packs containing oral hydration salts, soap, aqua tabs, chlorine, hand sanitizer, garbage bags, educational material and stationery. The other $500,000 will be spent on a national awareness campaign. ""The recent outbreak of cholera is a devastating development for the people of Haiti, and serves as an important reminder of all that remains to be done in our work to help Haiti build back better after the earthquake,"" said former President Bill Clinton. The last cholera epidemic in the Western Hemisphere began in Peru in 1991 and spread to some 16 other countries, from Argentina to Canada, according to the Pan American Health Organization. From 1991 to 1997, Peru alone saw more than 650,000 cases. A similar pattern in Haiti could produce some 270,000 cases, which means public health officials likely face long-term challenges in Haiti. The United Nations denied an assertion promoted by some Haitians that Nepalese peacekeepers were responsible for starting the cholera outbreak. U.N. statements said the protests may be politically motivated to create insecurity ahead of November 28 elections. Symptoms of cholera, an acute, bacterial illness caused by drinking tainted water, can be mild or even nonexistent. But sometimes they can be severe: leg cramps, profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting, which can cause rapid loss of body fluids and lead to dehydration, shock and death. Journalists Dmitri Foucard and Diulka Perez and CNN's Ivan Watson, Moni Basu and Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","At least 6 people suffered gunshot wounds .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela led mourning for his great-granddaughter at a chapel in Johannesburg, South Africa, on Thursday, his office announced. Zenani Mandela, 13, was buried in a private ceremony earlier in the day, Mandela's office said, after she was killed in a car crash June 11. ""I should have let you sleep longer when you told me you were tired. I should have let you wear all the make-up in the world,"" Zenani's mother Zoleka Mandela said in a message read by a family friend at the service, according to the Mandela Foundation. ""I should have given you more money, more hugs, more kisses, and I should have whispered more in your ear 'I love you,' "" Refiloe Seakemela said, overcome with emotion as she read the mother's statement. Zenani was returning from the World Cup soccer tournament's kickoff concert when she was killed. Mandela, who did much to bring the tournament to his country, skipped the World Cup kickoff, which came only hours after Zenani died. Zenani turned 13 two days before she died. Her uncle, Prince Zinhle Dlamini, told mourners that she had met Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo on her birthday. ""Ronaldo is here because it's my birthday and he doesn't even know who I am,"" Dlamini remembered her saying. ""My gift from him was a kiss and two signed T-shirts of Real Madrid."" ""She was a precious little girl who shined bright for everyone to see,"" he said, choking up, the foundation said. Zenani was in a car returning from the show at Orlando Stadium in Soweto when the wreck occurred. No other vehicle was involved in the wreck, the foundation said. The driver was arrested for culpable homicide and drunk driving, police told CNN. Zenani was one of Mandela's nine great-grandchildren. Her great-grandmother Winnie Madikizela-Mandela -- Mandela's ex-wife -- also attended the memorial, as did Mandela's wife Graca Machel, along with other relatives, schoolfriends and teachers. Mandela, who is 91, has limited his public appearances recently, although he did meet the South Africa soccer squad before the World Cup began.","Zenani Mandela, 13, was killed in a car wreck last week .

"Rome (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of university students took to the streets of Rome on Wednesday, Italian media estimated, amid heavy security to protest educational reforms planned by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's government. Students say the reforms will harm their futures and Italy's educational system. The demonstrations came in the wake of violent protests on December 14, after Berlusconi survived a parliamentary vote that could have ended his tenure as prime minister. He pulled through by three votes. Ensuing violence on that day caused an estimated 20 million euros ($26 million) damage to Rome's historic center when cars, garbage cans and benches were set aflame and cash machines and store windows were smashed. More than 100 people were injured, although none seriously. Protesters on Wednesday opted to avoid the heavily patrolled city center by aiming for the outskirts of town, where they blocked a major thoroughfare. ""We are peaceful. We think the only violence is the reform the government is imposing on our country in these days,"" Simone Oggionni, a demonstrator outside Rome's La Sapienza University, told CNN. The student marches remained peaceful into the mid-afternoon in the Italian capital. However, there were reports of pockets of violence in other Italian cities, including Milan and Palermo. Backers of the reform say it will save Italy's education system by increasing transparency and reinforcing a meritocracy. Students claim the reform package amounts to cuts and the privatization of the education sector. Known as the ""legge Gelmini"" after Education Minister Mariastella Gelmini, the reform was scheduled for a vote in the Senate Wednesday, but voting is now likely to be put off until Thursday. Students are reaching out to Italy's President Giorgio Napolitano and planned to meet with him later on Wednesday. Napolitano has the power to block the reform's passage by withholding his signature. A group of university neuroscience researchers were also at the march. One protester who identified herself only as Federica told CNN, ""We are researchers in cognitive neuroscience and are not going to get our projects funded... plus a lot of hospitals where we carry on our research are going to close because of budget cuts."" Some estimates say the reform will result in 130,000 job losses in the education sector.","NEW: Scientists say their funding will be cut by the reforms .

"(CNN) -- Shark experts began arriving in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on Tuesday to investigate what led to four attacks over the last week that killed a German woman and injured three snorkelers, officials said. The behavioral experts will form an advisory team to assess and advise on the best course of action following the attacks, according to Jochen Van Lysebettens, general operations manager of the Red Sea Diving College in Sharm el-Sheikh. The tab for the expert advice is being picked up by the Ministry of Tourism. Van Lysebettens said the reason behind the shark attacks needs to be determined in order to stop it. Sharm el-Sheikh beach will remain closed until the shark responsible for Sunday's fatal attack is found, according to Egypt's Interior Ministry. A 70-year-old woman, a regular guest at the resort, was snorkeling near a reef on Sunday when she was attacked, he said. She called for help, and a lifeguard brought her to shore, but she had lost too much blood and resuscitation efforts failed, Van Lysebettens said. The woman's arm and leg had been severed, he said. Amateur video of the attack showed splashing in shallow water as boaters looked on. ""It came at her,"" said the tourist and videographer, who asked not to be identified. The shark ""kept biting her while she was screaming for help and trying to get away,"" he said. The videographer's voice can be heard in the video, growing increasingly loud as the attack continued without apparent intervention from onlookers aboard nearby boats. ""Look at the blood,"" he said. ""Oh my god."" After the incident, the Chamber of Diving and Watersports called on its members in the region ""to stop any snorkeling activities happening from any boats or shore."" The chamber is under the umbrella of the Egyptian Tourist Federation. On Friday, two sharks were caught and killed near the South Sinai National Park on the Sharm el-Sheikh coast, according to the Chamber of Diving and Watersports. The three injured snorkelers -- two Russian women and a man from the Ukraine -- were attacked in a 24-hour period November 30 and December 1, the chamber said. Van Lysebettens said he is not a marine biologist, but many have speculated an oceanic white-tipped shark was responsible for the German woman's death, as well as the other attacks. But the videographer of Sunday's attack said the shark he filmed did not have white markings on its fins. Some are upset because the two sharks killed Friday are thought to be innocent. They were a mako shark and another oceanic white-tipped shark -- which did not match pictures taken by someone accompanying one of the injured snorkelers, Van Lysebettens said. ""This incident has clearly shocked our community, and the CDWS is continuing its investigation into why this may have happened,"" Hesham Gabr, head of the Chamber of Diving and Watersports, said in the statement. ""It is clear from our initial discussions with shark behavioral experts that this highly unusual spate of attacks by an oceanic (white tipped) shark was triggered by an activity, most probably illegal fishing or feeding in the area."" Several divers in the area saw carcasses of dead sheep in the water last week, Van Lysebettens said. It's not known how they got there, he said, but they could have washed out to sea or fallen off a boat. The shark may have been attracted by the carcass, he said, and could now be attacking slow-moving things on the water's surface. Van Lysebettens also said chumming could be to blame for the attacks. Chum is a mixture of blood and dead fish parts, which is used to lure sharks. CNN's Brian Walker and Karen Smith contributed to this report.","Officials have closed area beaches until the shark is found .

"(CNN) -- Four ferries carrying about 1,000 passengers have been freed from heavy ice off the coast of Sweden and were back in port Friday, said the Maritime Search and Rescue Center. Arctic winds hampered icebreakers' efforts to free the ferries and at least 30 other ships from the icy grip of the Baltic Sea on Thursday, according to Birger Knutsson, a spokesman for the maritime center, in Gothenburg, Sweden. The area with the worst ice was bounded by mainland Sweden, the Stockholm archipelago and the Finnish island of Aland, according to the Swedish Maritime Administration. ""It has been a lot colder than normal in the southern parts of the Baltic Sea. But in the north, all is normal, with normal levels of ice,"" said Tommy Gardebring with the maritime group. ""However, in the worst-affected areas, the icebreakers that normally operate haven't been able to cope with the ice. ""There was never any danger for the safety of the vessels. But we have increased our preparedness, just in case, since the ice puts a lot of pressure on the sides of the ships,"" Gardebring said.

"(CNN) -- Some of the world's largest airlines are conducting safety checks after debris fell from the engine of a Qantas Airbus A380 as it flew over Indonesia.  Australia's national airline has now grounded its Airbus A380 fleet indefinitely. How serious is the incident -- and what does it mean for the aviation industry? What do we know about the Qantas engine incident? One of the four engines on the Qantas A380, which was carrying 440 passengers and 26 crew Thursday, shut down shortly after it left Singapore's Changi Airport. The most obvious sign of damage to the plane is that part of one engine cowling, or covering, had been blown away. Debris was later found on the Indonesian island of Batan. Why is this being taken so seriously? This type of incident is known as an ""uncontained engine failure,"" explains Richard Quest, CNN's aviation correspondent. ""Probably something happened at the front of the engine, it ingested into the engine, out the other side and that's where the explosion or non-containment happened.""  Quest highlighted damage to the wing above the engine, including puncture marks.  ""Whatever event took place in engine number two, the debris from that event exploded outwards, removing part of the cowling and, it seems, going upwards through the wing."" Quest said the debris hit the wing by the forward slats, several meters away from critical areas such as the fuel tanks and fuel lines. ""Any form of debris that leaves an engine and has upward momentum sufficiently that it can go through the wing in that sort of mode has to be taken very seriously indeed,"" Quest said. ""That is why, in this case, Qantas has decided to ground the fleet."" Quest highlighted other signs of damage on the engine casing, including the presence of soot marks where the fan and combustion chambers meet the exhaust. ""That suggests there was clearly some sort of an event, some sort of fire,"" he explained.  Were the passengers and air crew in any danger?  While the incident was serious, the plane landed with no reported injuries. Quest said the pilot would have faced a challenging landing: one of his reverse thrusters would not work and he would be carrying too much fuel.   But air crews practice for such eventualities. ""This was not even a difficult landing for him."" How common is this type of incident?  An uncontained engine failure is extremely uncommon, said Quest -- but it has happened on several occasions before. In 1985 a British Airtours Boeing 737-236 at Manchester International Airport in northern England, caught fire as it readied for take-off. Debris from the engine punctured an underwing fuel tank access panel, according to a later Air Accident Investigation Branch report into the incident. The resulting blaze engulfed the fuselage in a matter of minutes, killing 55 passengers and crew. What do we know about the engine itself?  The engine used on the Qantas Airbus A380 is the Rolls Royce Trent 900. All A380s -- save those flown by Emirates -- are fitted with it, accounting for more than half the 37 A380s in operation before Thursday's incident. In a statement to CNN, a Rolls-Royce spokesperson said: ""Safety is always our highest priority. We are currently analyzing the available information and working with our customers to support their operations."" Shares in Rolls Royce dropped more than five percent Thursday in trading on the London Stock Exchange. What's the safety record of the Airbus A380?  The plane involved in this incident would be about two years old, with the engine of a similar age. The Airbus A380 has a 100 percent safety record, Quest explained. ""There have been niggles with the fuel systems and engines but nothing like this, they have more been operational issues. It is an extremely complicated airplane. The plane is designed for an uncontained engine failure."" ""The airlines love it,"" adds Quest. ""Everyone who flies on the A380 says it's quiet, it's roomy, it's comfortable.""  The incident happened in the same region as Indonesian volcano Mount Merapi, which is now active. Could this have been a factor?  Investigators will look at all possibilities. Earlier this year, no-fly zones were imposed across Europe due to ash clouds from Iceland's EyjafjallajÃ¶kull. It was feared that dust and ash from the volcano might damage airplane engines. However, while Mount Merapi is also in Indonesia, it is located several hundred miles from where the incident took place. IVolcanic activity has not yet been flagged as a serious possible cause of the engine failure. What is Airbus saying about the incident?  In a statement to CNN company spokesperson Justin Dubon confirmed that ""a Qantas A380 returned safely back to Singapore. The Singaporean authorities have launched an official investigation and these will be led by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB). ""Airbus is providing full technical assistance and is dispatching a technical team to Singapore where Airbus already has resident technical personnel."" Has there been any comment from other operators of the A380?  Singapore Airlines said in a statement on its website that it would delay all its A380 flights for the time being. ""Our engine manufacturer Rolls Royce and aircraft manufacturer Airbus have advised us to conduct precautionary technical checks on our A380 aircraft, following today's incident involving another operator's A380.""  Lufthansa, which operates three A380s, including to Tokyo, said: ""Our operations are as normal. We are on standby to go further but no decisions have been made.""

"(CNN) -- Colombia's president says devastating flooding forced him to cancel his scheduled trip to the United Nations climate change conference in Mexico this week -- even though global warming itself could be causing the disaster his country faces. ""I canceled the trip I was taking to Cancun ... to attend the international conference on climate change, which is what is affecting us, but I canceled this meeting,"" President Juan Manuel Santos said in a statement Sunday. At least 194 people were killed and 248 injured after torrential rains in Colombia that have affected nearly 1.6 million people, according to the country's interior ministry. The downpours have caused landslides and overflowing rivers, destroying at least 2,040 houses and damaging nearly 270,000 more nationwide, the ministry said. Rescue crews continued to work Monday after a landslide in the suburbs of Medellin, Colombia, buried between 30 and 50 homes, Red Cross National Deputy Director Jorge Ivan Nova told CNN. Up to 150 people were affected, he said. As of Monday night, they had found 23 bodies, Nova said, and more than 120 others could still be trapped underground. Seven others were injured. Better weather on Monday helped rescuers, but there was so much water on the ground that further mudslides were a risk, he said. Bersabe Alzate cradled her head in her hands and held back tears as she described the search for her family members. ""Two little girls, my sister-in-law and my niece -- they are trapped and they haven't been found,"" Alzate told Caracol. ""They haven't been able to get them out.""

""From this tragedy that has no precedent in the history of our country, we are going to forge ahead,"" Santos said Sunday after flying over some of the most severely affected areas, according to a statement on the government's website.

"(CNN) -- Yemen could turn out like Somalia if the current rate of international investment doesn't increase, the country's deputy finance minister told CNN Monday. ""I'm not suggesting a failed state,"" Jalal Yaqoub said. ""What I'm suggesting (is) a state where citizens don't get the right services delivered to them."" Yemen sparked an international security alert this weekend when two packages mailed from the poor Arab nation were found to have explosives inside. The bombs could have brought down the planes carrying them, officials said. Yemen has become a major new battleground for al Qaeda, but Yaqoub denied it could become a ""failed state"" with no effective central government, like Somalia. ""I don't think Yemen is a collapsing state. I don't think Yemen is a weak state,"" he told CNN's Becky Anderson in an interview for ""Connect the World."" But it needs $45- to $50 billion in investment over the next decade to give people jobs, water, and electricity because ""extremism flourishes in an area where people have no jobs and too much time on their hands. ""We have ideas. We have plans. We have visions. And we need the support of the international community to make sure that jobs are being created and services delivered to these people and that will certainly help stabilize the country and reduce extremism."" Yaqoub said it ""would not surprise"" him if the United States increased its covert activities in his country in the wake of the foiled bomb plot, but that ""as a Yemeni citizen""  he did not like the idea of unmanned U.S. drones. The United States is thought to use drones to fire missiles at suspected terrorists in Pakistan, among other locations. It does not officially confirm such strikes. A U.S. official said Monday the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency continues to expand its intelligence operations in Yemen with more operatives and analysts working closely with the Yemen government and other U.S. partners inside the country. The increased focus on Yemen predates the Christmas Day attempt to blow up an airliner over Detroit. There has been no decision on expanding the CIA role to include running a drone campaign in Yemen. The official said the Agency has the capability to do so, but it ultimately is a White House decision to move forward on that front. Regarding the threat of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula compared to al Qaeda Pakistan, the official said ""this is not a zero sum game.""  Al Qaeda Pakistan remains very dangerous even though it is under intense pressure by the United States because of drone missile attacks. The official pointed to the European plot as having its roots in Pakistan. AQAP is an affiliate that has become increasingly more active. The two groups communicate and share ideas. Al Qaeda in Pakistan encourages AQAP to carry out attacks. However, the official said AQAP makes its own tactical decisions, runs its own day to day operations. The official said Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki is clearly playing a more prominent operational role in AQAP, he is part of the senior leadership. It would not be surprising if in the end, al-Awlaki had a role in the cargo bombing plot, but so far there is no direct evidence of that, the official said. Another U.S. official also said it ""wouldn't be a surprise if he ends up implicated in this."" Both officials said it is still unclear the intent of the cargo plot, this is whether the bombs were to explode in the planes or at the synagogues or had another purpose. The second official said the fact these were ""real devices, a real attempt"" pretty much discounts any theory that this was merely a trial run by the terrorists -- ""it doesn't hold much water anymore."" This official said experts are examining the devices to determine how they would have worked and whether they had the capability to work as intended.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- All Christians in the Middle East are now ""legitimate targets,"" al Qaeda in Iraq announced Wednesday, as the group's deadline for Egypt's Coptic church to release alleged Muslim female prisoners expired. An audio message released Monday gave the church 48 hours to disclose the status of Muslim women it said are imprisoned in Coptic churches in Egypt. The message purportedly came from the Islamic State of Iraq, which claimed responsibility for an attack on a Baghdad church Sunday that killed 58 people and wounded 75. The umbrella group includes a number of Sunni extremist organizations and has ties to al Qaeda in Iraq. The group said the women's alleged plight was the reason it stormed the church. Wednesday, the group released a new message saying, ""The Ministry of War of Islamic State of Iraq declares that all the centers, organizations and bodies of Christian leaders and followers have become legitimate targets by the Mujahedeens, wherever our hands will reach them."" Shortly after the message was released, Egyptian police sources confirmed that security has been reinforced at churches around the country. Additional protection was also being provided to the head of the Coptic Church, Pope Shenouda III, who is scheduled to give a sermon in Cairo in the evening, according to a police spokesman who could not be named in line with policy. Copts are adherents of an Egyptian sect of Christianity. About nine percent of Egyptians are Coptic, according to the Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook; 90 percent of Egyptians are Muslim. ""This is a matter of extreme seriousness and we should not underestimate the threat,"" said Yusif Sidhom, editor-in-chief of Watani, a weekly Coptic newspaper published in Cairo. ""We have to keep our eyes wide open and take all measures to ensure that our buildings and churches are not infiltrated."" Sidhom said he was encouraged by the security measures taken by the Egyptian government, as well as by the position taken by political forces in Egypt, including the Muslim Brotherhood, which has condemned the attack on the church in Baghdad and condemned threats against Egyptian Copts. Worshippers at the Sayidat al-Nejat church in Baghdad were about to begin Sunday night services when gunmen entered the church, according to Martin Chulov, a journalist for Britain's Guardian newspaper, who was at the scene. As many as 120 people were taken hostage, said Lt. Col. Eric Bloom, a U.S. military spokesman. The gunmen held them for hours before security forces stormed in to end the standoff, arresting eight suspects. Most of the hostages were killed or wounded when the attackers set off explosives inside the church, Iraqi Defense Minister Abdul Qader Obeidi said. At least two of the attackers were wearing explosive vests, which they detonated just minutes before security forces raided the church, police officials said. The gunmen were demanding that the Iraqi government release a number of detainees and prisoners in Iraqi prisons, saying the Christian hostages would be freed in return, according to the police officials. Iraq's defense minister later said on state television that the kidnappers had demanded the release of a number of prisoners in both Iraq and Egypt. ""The sword of slaughter will not be lifted off the necks of their followers until they denounce what the dog of the Egyptian church has committed, and until they show the Mujahedeens their serious endeavor to pressure the combatant (Coptic) church for the release of our Muslim sisters, who are captive in the prisons of their monateries,"" the militant group said Wednesday. The group's claim that the Coptic Church in Egypt is holding female prisoners is based on widespread rumors of Coptic women in Egypt converting to Islam and being detained by the church in an attempt to compel or persuade them to return to their original faith. Both the Egyptian Interior Ministry and the representatives of the Coptic Church in Cairo declined to comment on the matter. As for Iraqi Christians, the chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, said Wednesday they face ""a grave terrorist threat."" Leonard Leo said Christians are among the country's ""smallest religious minorities,"" which face a ""pattern of official discrimination, marginalization and neglect."" USCIRF, an independent, bipartisan U.S. federal government commission, reviews violations of religious freedom internationally and makes policy recommendations to the administration and Congress. ""It also is time for the Obama administration to acknowledge the sectarian aspects of the conflict in Iraq, which are evident in this attack, and ensure that U.S.-Iraq policy prioritizes the plight of the country's vulnerable religious minority communities,"" Leo said. ""Congress already has taken this step, as reflected in House and Senate resolutions that call on the U.S. government to, among other measures, work with the Iraqi government to enhance security at places of worship and ensure that members of ethnic and religious minority communities do not suffer discrimination and can effectively convey their concerns to government. The administration should act accordingly as quickly as possible.""

"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- Chile's Atacama Desert is no place to live. At night it's a freezing moonscape and when the sun comes up it becomes as hot as a burning skillet. There is little life and almost no water. The Atacama has been described as the driest desert in the world. Only when the ""camanchacas,"" or thick blankets of fog, blow in from the coast is there any precipitation. The brief watering can cause desert wildflowers to spring up and cover the rocky slopes in purple. But at the foot of a gold and copper mine a small and unlikely community -- part vigil, part refugee camp -- has also blossomed. It is called "" Campo Esperanza"" or Camp Hope and it is where many of the families of 33 miners have vowed to stay until their loved ones are pulled from the earth. It's almost certain to be a long wait. Two drills have already begun hammering away at the collapsed mine to free the men and a third is expected to begin work soon. Even so, Chilean mining officials say the men may not be freed until December. Maria Segovia is dug in for the long haul. She shares a tent with her sister in a row of encampments that line the road leading to the mine. On weekends more family members come. The rock wall behind her temporary home is a shrine to her younger brother Dario Segovia adorned with his picture, mining helmet and uniform. How faith is playing an important role for the families . Sevogia's spartan quarters are luxurious compared to the living conditions the families first endured after the collapse. ""It was empty,"" Segovia said. ""After the accident we began to build a camp. But at first it was terrible: We slept outside and in the day it was boiling, at night freezing and the worst was we didn't know if our boys were alive."" Seventeen days after the collapse, the families learned the miners had miraculously survived, but that freeing them would be an epic and lengthy undertaking. Across the street from Segovia's tent, Miguel Valenzuela pours water on the ground to slow the flow of dust pouring into his tent. A 25-year veteran of the mines, Valenzuela worked at the San Jose Mine, but wasn't inside when it caved in. Three close friends of his were entombed in the mine. ""It's a job but with a risk. Every day we walked in with the risk that something could happen,"" he said. Valenzuela lights candles to pictures of saints to assist the rescue, he sweeps and cooks and cleans for miners families to stay occupied. He doesn't want to think about what his friends are going through. ""I know better than anybody how they are doing. I have been where they have been, I know what it's like in a mine."" The drilling at the mine is the constant backdrop and barometer for Camp Hope. Its residents gaze out at the drilling to see if work is being done and if they can divine how much longer they -- and the miners -- will be here. They make small talk, watch TV in a cafeteria tent set up by the local government, or walk to the hill overlooking the camp to tend flags bearing the names of their loved ones. Every day Jose Sanchez watches a cell phone video of his son-in-law Victor Segovia, a self-taught musician, in which Victor plays a ranchera and sings to the camera with an easy smile. ""I watch it all the time to feel close to him,"" Jose said. ""Soon we'll be with him, spending afternoons together, having him play guitar and harmonica. It's the gift God will give us."" In the meantime, the families continue to lean on each other and fill the time. If the miners are a symbol of resolve for the world, their families want to provide their own example. After the mine collapse, many of the families did not know each other, said Segovia as she greeted new friends passing her tent. ""Now I see them and we are one family. We worry, talk and fight for each other."" ""What happened here was 33 families became one.""","""Camp Hope"" is a makeshift tent community set up by the families of the 33 trapped miners .

"(CNN) -- Juanita Castro, the younger sister of Cuban leaders Fidel and Raul Castro, worked for the CIA during some crucial years of the Cold War, she says in her new memoir. Juanita Castro, originally a supporter of the Cuban revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power in 1959, said she became disillusioned by growing injustice. ""They wanted to talk to me because they had interesting things to tell me, and interesting things to ask of me, such as if I was willing to take that risk, if I was ready to listen to them. I was semi-shocked, but I said yes anyway,"" she told CNN affiliate Univision-Noticias 23 in Miami, Florida. Univision's interviewer, journalist Maria Antonieta Collins, co-wrote the book. ""My Brothers Fidel and Raul, the Secret History"" was released Monday. In the book, Juanita Castro said she was introduced to the world of the CIA through a close friend on the island nation, Virginia Leitao da Cunha, wife of the Brazilian ambassador to Cuba in the early 1960s. In June 1961, under the guise of visiting her sister Enma in Mexico City, Castro met a CIA agent who called himself ""Enrique,"" the memoir says. In those first meetings in Mexico, which took place shortly after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, Enrique asked the young woman about general information regarding Cuba since the revolution, and then asked whether she would work for the agency, according to the book. The job that Enrique described was to help protect CIA agents working in Cuba, Castro said. ""The CIA has people in Cuba. Some could be discovered or already have. The mission is to protect them and move them from one place to another, providing the most security possible,"" the agent told her, according to the book. The CIA declined to comment on the book's claims. Her first mission was to deliver documents, money and messages hidden in canned goods from Mexico to Cuba, according to the book. Castro wrote that she agreed to help on the condition that she would not do anything violent against her brothers. She also refused payment when it was offered, she said. The CIA communicated through a short-wave radio. At an appointed hour daily, if the waltz ""Fascination"" aired on the radio, Castro would know that a message would follow. An overture from ""Madame Butterfly"" meant that no message was coming, according to the book. A special code was made up of numbers, which Castro would decode with a manual, she wrote. The period of her cooperation, from 1961 to 1969, included the Cuban Missile Crisis, which changed the way the Cold War was being waged. To resolve the crisis, the Soviet Union agreed to dismantle the missiles it had placed in Cuba in exchange for assurances that the United States would not invade Cuba. In 1964, Castro decided to leave Cuba for good, becoming an exile in Miami. She worked with anti-Castro exile groups there, and continued to cooperate with the CIA, according to the book. The relationship ended when U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union changed during Richard Nixon's presidency. As tensions eased with the Soviet Union, the United States would no longer back anti-Castro exiles, two CIA agents told her. When they asked her to use her influence to downplay rhetoric of a communist threat, she quit. The Cuban government had no immediate response to the publication of the book, Jorge Bolanos, chief of the Cuban Interest Section in Washington, told CNN en EspaÃ±ol on Monday. ""I haven't received any reaction from the Cuban government,"" he said. ""I am not in the position to comment about a book which I have not read yet."" CNN's Mariano Castillo and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","Memoir by Fidel Castro's sister, Juanita, says she worked for CIA .

"(CNN) -- Four months after an auto accident and reports of extramarital affairs put his golf career on hold, Tiger Woods announced Tuesday that he plans to return to the sport at the Masters Tournament in April. Woods dropped out of professional competition in December after a Thanksgiving weekend wreck outside his Florida home turned a harsh spotlight on the golfer's personal life. In March, the 34-year-old golfer issued a public apology for cheating on his wife and said he was undergoing treatment for unspecified ""issues."" But on Tuesday, he said he was coming back to play in the Masters, which he has won four times since 1997. ""After a long and necessary time away from the game, I feel like I'm ready to start my season at Augusta,"" Woods said in a statement released by his agent. ""The major championships have always been a special focus in my career and, as a professional, I think Augusta is where I need to be, even though it's been a while since I last played."" The tournament is scheduled for April 5-11 at Georgia's Augusta National Golf Club. Can Tiger the Great's return restore his legend? Billy Payne, the club's chairman, welcomed the return of the sport's top draw. ""We support Tiger's decision to return to competitive golf beginning at this year's Masters Tournament,"" Payne said in a statement shortly after the announcement. ""Additionally, we support and encourage his stated commitment to continue the significant work required to rebuild his personal and professional life."" And PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem added, ""We were pleased to learn that Tiger Woods will be playing the Masters in a few weeks. He has invested a lot of time taking steps, both in his personal and professional life, in order to prepare for his return. We all wish him and his family the best as he rejoins the tour."" Woods has won four PGA championships and six of the association's Grand Slam title. Tuesday's announcement comes nearly a month after Woods publicly apologized for what he called ""irresponsible and selfish"" behavior, which he said included infidelity, and said he was working to ""become a better man."" ""I have undergone almost two months of inpatient therapy, and I am continuing my treatment,"" he said in Tuesday's statement. ""Although I'm returning to competition, I still have a lot of work to do in my personal life."" Woods' public woes began with an early-morning crash November 27 outside his Orlando-area home, when he suffered minor injuries after striking a fire hydrant and a tree with his Cadillac SUV. Woods was not required to talk to police about the wreck and declined to talk with investigators on several occasions. Eventually, he was cited for careless driving. He paid a $164 fine and received four points on his driving record. The wreck occurred days after the tabloid National Enquirer named Woods as having an affair with a New York nightclub hostess. The woman has denied the allegation, but several others have come forward to claim that they had sexual relationships with Woods, who is married to former model Elin Nordegren. The couple has two children. In his carefully managed March statement, delivered to a small, hand-picked crowd, Woods said he was in inpatient therapy for 45 days from the end of December to early February for ""issues,"" which he did not explain. The controversy prompted several major sponsors to suspend or drop their relationships with Woods, who also apologized to his business partners for his behavior. And he denied speculation that Nordegren attacked him the night of the accident, saying she showed ""enormous grace and poise throughout this ordeal.""","Superstar athlete sidelined by sex scandal .

"(CNN) -- Six years ago, hip hop icon Wyclef Jean released a soulful tune called ""President,"" in which he fantasized about what it would be like to lead a country. That fantasy may come closer to reality when the Haitian-American recording artist announces exclusively on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" that he intends to run for president of Haiti. Jean, who had been an outspoken proponent for Haiti through his Yele Foundation, told CNN Tuesday that plans to make the major announcement on King's show Thursday night. Born in Haiti, Jean shot to fame in the mid-1990s as a member of The Fugees, a U.S.-based hip-hop and reggae group. He performs now as a solo artist. He was one of the first celebrities to offer aid after the devastating earthquake there in January. He told CNN late last month that he has filled out the necessary paperwork to make a run at the country's highest office. In February, Jean said he has tried to promote Haitian issues in his work. ""I've always promoted Haiti in my music, since my first album with the Fugees where we talked about what Haitians are going through and about human rights for people around the world,"" Jean said. ""This is how we came in the game, we never thought we were going to be music stars because the topics we talked about were not very popular in mainstream music."" Jean said he was born in ""a small village in Port-au-Prince."" He moved to Brooklyn, New York, when he was nine, he said. ""I had never been inside an airplane before -- me and my brother looked out the window and saw nothing but a bunch of lights,"" said Jean. ""I told my brother, 'Look, we've arrived, it's the city of diamonds,' because it was shining so much."" Jean said he grew up in housing projects in Brooklyn, ""one of the roughest areas at the time."" He was able to grow from those humble beginnings to be a top recording star and now he says he will try to help rebuild his birthplace. iReporter: 'The dangers of a Wyclef presidency' The January 12 earthquake in Haiti killed more than 220,000 people, destroyed 60 percent of government infrastructure and left more than 180,000 homes uninhabitable.

"(CNN) -- Steven Gerrard returned to Liverpool's starting line-up but he was only able to help the English Premier League side claim a point as they were held to a goalless draw by Wolves on Tuesday. Liverpool struggled to break down a resilient Wolves defence and rarely tested home goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann as both sides opted for a solitary striker up front at Molineux with chances at a premium. Gerrard, who had returned earlier than expected from a hamstring problem, was clearly short of match fitness and the Reds captain was unable to have his usual influence on the game. Spain winger Albert Riera had the best opportunity for the visitors when he lashed a speculative lob from distance which appeared to be creeping under the bar before American goalkeeper Hahnemann produced a one-handed save to push the ball over. Despite the result Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez remained upbeat and was pleased with Gerrard's return to match action. ""It was positive for us to have Steven back -- you could see he still needs to improve his match fitness but it was not a risk to play him tonight,"" Benitez told Sky Sports. ""Overall the final pass seemed to be difficult for us and Wolves defended well. You can see the team was working hard and there are a lot of good things for us to take out of the game."" Liverpool are now unbeaten in five Premier League clashes but are three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur, who eased to a 2-0 victory over Fulham at White Hart Lane, in the race for the Champions League places. Spurs were searching for a first Premier League this year and took the lead when Peter Crouch took advantage of some uncertainty in the Fulham defence to clip the ball home from close range in the 27th minute. Harry Redknapp's team were able to double that lead in the 60th minute when David Bentley made the most of a rare start when his free-kick was deflected past Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer. Elsewhere, Bolton manager Owen Coyle was given a hostile reception at former club Burnley but came away with a 1-0 win thanks to Chung-Yong Lee's 35th minute strike which rattled in off the underside of the crossbar. Portsmouth and West Ham remain among the league's strugglers after they played out a scrappy 1-1 draw at Fratton Park. West Ham took the lead when Younes Kaboul's headed clearance looped in off the chest of Matthew Upson in the 52nd minute before Danny Webber rescued a point for Pompey in the 76th minute when he slotted the ball through the legs of Hammers goalkeeper Robert Green. Meanwhile Roma midfielder Daniele De Rossi scored the only goal of the game to give his side a narrow victory over nine-man Catania in the quarterfinal of the in the Coppa Italia. Catania goalkeeper Andrea Campagnolo made a string of brilliant saves before Italy international De Rossi broke the deadlock at the Stadio Olimpico in the 74th minute . Stefano Okaka cushioned the ball into the path of De Rossi who drilled it in the bottom corner with a smart left-foot finish as Blazej Augustyn and Giuseppe Bellusci were sent off for the visitors.","Steven Gerrard returned to Liverpool's starting line-up but his side were held to a goalless draw with Wolves on Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- English FA Cup holders Chelsea secured their place in the last 16 of the competition with a 2-0 fourth-round victory over Preston at Deepdale on Saturday. Preston, managed by Darren Ferguson - son of Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson - produced a spirited performance but Carlo Ancelotti's Premier League side possessed too much quality for their Championship opponents. Nicolas Anelka's low strike put Chelsea ahead in the 37th minute before Daniel Sturridge slammed in a second just after the halftime interval to ease any nerves. Chelsea assistant first-team coach Ray Wilkins, who stepped in for manager Ancelotti at the post-match press conference, singled out Anelka's performance for special praise. Wilkins said: ""From our perspective Nicolas is playing some outstanding football. He is a joy to have around the place. ""He enjoys his training, he is working extremely hard and he is getting the rewards from that."" In the day's late kick-off League One Leeds United scored a dramatic injury time equalizer as they twice came from a goal down to earn a replay after a 2-2 draw with top-flight outfit Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. Jermaine Beckford, who was the hero of Leeds' shock FA Cup victory over Manchester United in the third round, again stole the limelight for Simon Grayson's side as he grabbed both goals for the visitors. Spurs took the lead through Peter Crouch in the 42nd minute before Beckford levelled for Leeds seven minutes after the halftime break with a well-taken finish. Tottenham looked to have secured passage to the next round when Russian international Roman Pavlyuchenko stroked the ball home in the 75th minute but Leeds refused to throw in the towel and were awarded a penalty in the sixth minute of injury time when Michael Dawson fouled Beckford inside the box. The Leeds striker dusted himself down and emphatically despatched the resulting spot-kick past Spurs goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes and into the top corner to earn his side a replay. A late goal from Wigan Athletic's Ben Watson denied League Two Notts Country a famous FA Cup win as Roberto Martinez's side fought back from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Meadow Lane and force a replay.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- This week's Champions League semi-finals are poised to offer a feast of the world's best strikers. Didier Drogba: Is he good enough to be called the best striker in the world? The game's best finishers will face off against each other in the ties involving Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Barcelona. But of all the strikers who is best? The storming return to form for Chelsea's Didier Drogba has certainly pushed his case as the best in the game. The Ivory Coast forward, who had a forgettable first half of the 2008/2009 season, has relished the arrival of Guus Hiddink as temporary manager. He has since proved too good for some of the best sides in Europe.  See our list of the top strikers in the world Â» .

Who do you think is the best striker in the world? Tell what you think of our picks and who should be number one. Eto'o makes a compelling case for himself as the best in the business this season. Having scored 27 league goals to be La Liga's top scorer, the Cameroon striker is in great form and pushing Barca towards the league title. And what about the glittering array of talent at the disposal of Manchester United and Arsenal? Wayne Rooney will once again be crucial to United if they are to retain their European crown. The England striker has been a huge threat this season for both club and country, whether deployed as a striker or pushed out wide. Rooney is ably supported by none other than world player of the year Ronaldo, the club's top scorer, even though he's not really a striker. Arsenal may be out of the running for England's domestic title, but Emmanuel Adebayor and the injured Robin van Persie have fired the Gunners into the last four in Europe's premier club competition. Indeed Adebayor's stunning equalizer against Villarreal in Spain is a contender for goal of the season. Outside of this week's matches in Europe there are still some players who are worthy of consideration. Liverpool's Fernando Torres is undoubtedly one of the best in the game, while it's also tough to look past the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic -- who has helped Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan top Italy's Serie A for much of the season.","CNN's Football Fanzone picks 11 of the world's best strikers .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Tropical Storm Alex -- the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season this year -- formed in the Caribbean on Saturday as BP continued to battle a massive oil spill in the Gulf. Alex had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph) and was about 250 miles away from Chetumal, Mexico. It was moving toward Belize and over the Yucatan Peninsula. It was not clear whether the storm could hit the part of the Gulf affected by the massive oil spill that has been gushing since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20, killing 11 workers. A tropical storm in the oil-tainted Gulf of Mexico would disrupt BP efforts to drill relief wells and capture the oil at sea. It would also complicate efforts to clean up miles of coastline. High winds and seas could distribute the oil -- still gushing from a blown deepwater well -- over a wider area while storm surges could wash more oil ashore, according to a fact sheet prepared by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A tropical storm warning is in effect for the coast of Belize, the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, and various islands of Honduras. It means storm conditions are expected within the warning area within 36 hours. Meteorologist Karen Maginnis says the ""preferred scenario"" actually would be for the storm to head to northern Florida. That's because the oil spill has been gradually rotating counterclockwise. If the storm heads to the east of it, it would send the oil farther out to sea. If the storm heads more directly towards the central Gulf and Louisiana, it might push the oil toward Florida. Of course, forecasting where oil spills are headed in not easy. ""We're really in unchartered territory,"" Maginnis said.""We've never been in this situation before. We've never seen an oil spill that encompassed the Gulf like this, end up so close to shore."" She noted that the latest models do point to the storm heading to the central Gulf. Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, who's heading the federal cleanup operation, says he'll have to redeploy people and equipment to safer areas 120 hours (five days) in advance of gale-force winds. And he agreed there is ""no playbook"" when it comes to responding to a massive oil spill as a storm brews. ""But I will tell you there's been an extraordinary amount of planning being done,"" he told CNN. ""We are going to try to merge two response structures. One has proven effective in the past, and that's a central coordination of search and rescue and how operations are conducted, and that's done out of Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida for hurricanes. And we are in the process of integrating our planning processes so the oil spill response is integrated fully within the search and rescue recovery operations."" But a powerful storm would not just disrupt efforts to drill relief wells and capture the oil at sea, of course. It would complicate efforts to clean up miles of coastline. ""It's going to mean we're going to have to find a way to maneuver all our resources, change things,"" said Grover Robinson, chairman of the Escambia County Commission in Pensacola, Florida. ""We won't be able to fight the oil for a couple of days. And we have no idea about winds and current and what it will do to the oil in the gulf. So obviously, it's a very big concern for us."" Allen said he and some top Obama administration officials, including Vice President Joe Biden, will be headed back to the Gulf region next week to assess the oil relief efforts. But in a new blow to fishermen, Mississippi officials announced that waters east of the Gulfport shipping channel would be closed to shrimping, because of oil sighted in the area. Meanwhile, there been some promising news for potentially tens of thousands of people seeking claims against BP. Kenneth Feinberg, who is administering the $20 billion fund set up by BP under White House prodding, says that people who work in support of oil rigs will be able to file claims -- and not just fishermen and businesses along the coast. Employees of businesses that brings tools to oil rigs, for example, also would be able to file a claim. The company previously agreed to set aside the $20 billion in an escrow account for spill-related costs, a sum that does not cover fees and penalties that could be imposed by the federal government. BP had resisted approving claims by people who said they were affected by the moratorium on oil drilling, saying it was imposed by the Obama administration. But Feinberg said BP and the administration now have agreed those claims will be covered. ""I now have discovered -- I didn't realize this until yesterday, but the moratorium claims will fall under my jurisdiction,"" he told CNN. To date, almost 74,000 claims have been filed and more than 39,000 payments have been made, totaling almost $126 million, according to the company. In another development, there has been some promising news in the effort to permanently stop the leak. BP said Friday its ""ranging"" process, by which it sends an electrical current that puts out an electromagnetic field down the well bore, detected Wednesday where the leaking well is in relation to the first relief well, at a depth of 16,275 feet. BP said subsequent ranging runs will be needed to more precisely locate the leaking well and figure out how to best intersect the two. ""What they will do is continue to drill down in short intervals, withdraw the pipe, put that sensing device down and slowly close on the well bore to the point where they're ready to do the intercept drilling. This last part takes some time because they only do several hundred feet at a time."" said Allen. ""They'll also have a vessel standing by full of mud on the top, so in the event there were to get really close and potentially nick the well bore, they could actually put the mud down to control any hydrocarbons that might come out."" Drilling and ranging operations will continue over the next few weeks toward the target intercept depth of approximately 18,000 feet. ""Kill"" operations are expected to begin when the relief well reaches the leaking well. BP said drilling also continues on a second relief well, which has reached 10,500 feet. Costs associated with the Gulf oil disaster have gone up more than $300 million in less than a week, BP said Friday. ""The cost of the response to date amounts to approximately $2.35 billion, including the cost of the spill response, containment, relief well drilling, grants to the Gulf states, claims paid and federal costs,"" a company statement said. BP put the tab at $2 billion on Monday. Meanwhile, Deepwater drilling could resume by the end of July. U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Thursday denied a request to keep a six-month moratorium imposed by President Barack Obama on May 27 in place, pending a government appeal. The government has 30 days to show it is beginning to comply with Feldman's order and start issuing permits. The appeals process can continue, but until the appeal, the government must act as if Feldman's order will be upheld. Feldman turned down the government's request for a stay of his order late Thursday, and the Justice Department appealed that ruling to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. Government lawyers filed an appeal to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Friday, asking the court to stay Feldman's order pending the appeals.

"(CNN) -- Parts of northeast Australia braced for more flooding Thursday, a day after the nation's prime minister promised aid to flood-ravaged towns, and half of the state of Queensland was declared a disaster zone. Emerald, an inland city of 15,000 residents, had essentially been isolated by flood waters and was accessible only by helicopter. ""Things have changed drastically overnight,"" said Megan Lewis, a radio reporter with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, in an interview from the city on Thursday. ""Yesterday the town was expecting things to not be so bad."" Waters have reached 15.4 meters (51 feet) there and are expected to rise another meter on Friday, she said. Lewis did not specify exactly where in the town that level was reached. Some Emerald residents have been making their way to evacuation centers around the city, while others are stockpiling food and supplies. On Wednesday, the Australian government provided two Blackhawk helicopters to help evacuate all 300 residents from the town of Theodore, one of the worst affected by the floods. Queensland Emergency Services Minister Neil Roberts said Theodore was one of about 20 communities that had to be evacuated because of the floods. ""Most of our major river systems have been in flood over the last week,"" Roberts told CNN. Besides Emerald, the other major population center threatened by flooding is Rockhampton, a city of 50,000 on the coast, he said. Forecasters have said the weather would clear over the next 48 hours, Roberts said, but the heavy rain the area has had so far means water has built up in river catchment areas. ""It does take a day to three days, in some instances, for that water to come down in some of the cities that are under threat, so we're over the worst of the rain, but some of the worst flooding is still yet to come,"" he said. The Bureau of Meteorology said flood warnings remained in place for many areas of Australia, with major and moderate flooding still occurring throughout much of Queensland's southern half. Thirty-one of Queensland's 73 communities are now receiving government disaster assistance, Prime Minister Julia Gillard's office announced. Acting Attorney General Brendan O'Connor said the government would continue to monitor the situation in disaster-declared areas across Australia and work with state authorities to provide more assistance.","NEW: City of Emerald is isolated, accessible only by helicopter .

"(CNN) -- Serie A leaders Inter Milan have confirmed they have cancelled the contract of Brazilian striker Adriano with immediate effect. Adriano walked out on Inter Milan to return to Brazil, citing depression and saying he needed a break. Inter confirmed on their official Web site that they rescinded Adriano's contract from April 1st, after the 27-year-old walked out on the club to return to his homeland, citing depression and claiming he needed a break from football. ""Inter would like to thank Adriano for his 74 goals and the eight years spent together,"" the club said in a short statement. Adriano joined Inter in 2001, although he had three loan spells with Fiorentina (2002), twice with Parma (2002 and 2004) and Sao Paulo (2008). He played 177 times for the club, scoring 48 goals in 123 league appearances and 18 in 35 European matches -- winning the Serie A title in 2006, 2007 and 2008 as well as two Italian Cup victories. Adriano was last seen in public on the Brazil bench during the April 1 World Cup qualifying win over Peru.","Brazil international striker Adriano released from his contract with Inter Milan .

"(CNN) -- Richard Gasquet has been cleared of any wrongdoing by the Court of Arbitration for Sport after the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) failed in their appeal against the decision to overturn a ban he had received after testing positive for cocaine. The 23-year-old Frenchman had tested positive for the drug at the Sony Ericsson Open in Florida in March of this year and he was handed a provisional 12-month ban. But an ITF panel overturned the ban in July, accepting Gasquet's claim that the substance was only in his system due to him kissing a woman who had taken cocaine at a nightclub. The ITF and WADA chose to appeal that decision with CAS, seeking a two-year suspension, with the world number 47 attending a hearing last month. A CAS press release read: ""The CAS panel decided to dismiss the appeals after having found that in this particular case Richard Gasquet had not committed any fault or negligence within the meaning of the ITF Anti-Doping Program."" The CAS panel also accepted Gasquet's assertion of how traces of cocaine metabolite were found in his urine sample. The CAS statement continued: ""The panel based its ruling on the evidence provided by the experts called by both the player and the ITF, who agreed that the amount of cocaine metabolite was so minute that it must have reflected incidental exposure, rather than use in the amounts commonly taken by social users of cocaine. ""Furthermore, it was also established that the player was clearly not a regular cocaine user, even in very small amounts. As a consequence, the possibility of contamination became the most plausible explanation justifying the presence of cocaine metabolite in the player's urine. ""On a balance of probability, the CAS panel concluded that it was more likely than not that the player's contamination with cocaine resulted, as Gasquet always asserted, from kissing a woman in a nightclub in Miami on the day before the anti-doping test and that the player had met the required standards of proof with respect to the way of ingestion.""","Richard Gasquet has been cleared of any wrongdoing by the Court of Arbitration for Sport .

"(CNN) -- Former world No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo has announced her retirement from tennis, revealing that she no longer has the desire to play and train. The 30-year-old won two Grand Slam tournaments in 2006 as she spent 34 weeks at the top of the rankings, but has suffered a gradual slide since following a series of injuries and ended this year at No. 21. The Frenchwoman won the Paris Indoor Open earlier this year, but it proved to be a false dawn in her return to top form and she skipped the final two tournaments of 2009. ""I came here to announce the end of my career. I made this decision after careful consideration,"" she told reporters at an emotional press conference on Thursday. ""I don't want to train anymore. I had to make a decision, which became evident in the last few months and weeks. When you grow older, it's more difficult to stay at the top. ""It's a bit sad, but this is the right decision. I was lucky enough to have an exceptional career and to experience very strong feelings on the court. ""I dreamt of this career, I dreamt of winning a Grand Slam title. I lifted trophies in every city in the world and I lived 10 magical and unbelievable years."" Mauresmo claimed her first major win at the Australian Open when Justine Henin pulled out with injury during the final, but she defied her doubters by beating the Belgian to claim the Wimbledon title later that year. Henin and her compatriot have both ended their relatively brief retirements this year, but Mauresmo said she was unlikely to have a similar change of mind. ""Even if I've learned to never say never, the players you are thinking about stopped earlier than me before coming back,"" she said. WTA Tour chair Stacey Allaster paid tribute to the player. ""Amelie's accomplishments not only include winning two Grand Slam titles and becoming the first French player to reach the world No. 1 ranking, but leading France to a Fed Cup victory, and generously donating her time to various social causes,"" she said. ""Amelie is an extraordinary player, one of the nicest and friendliest personalities on tour, and a true champion both in tennis and in life."" Mauresmo won the junior French Open and Wimbledon titles in 1996 before heading to the senior circuit, where she reached the Australian Open final in 1999 before losing to Martina Hingis. She became the first French player, male or female, to reach the top of the rankings in 2004, when she won the silver medal at the Athens Olympics, losing to Henin in the final. But her career came off the rails in 2007, missing two months due to injury and finishing outside the top-10 for the first time in seven seasons. The following year was even worse as she ended it outside the top-20. Mauresmo won 25 titles overall, and was a losing finalist 23 times.","Former world No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo announces her retirement from tennis .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Fearing for people's safety, Iranian opposition leaders canceled a demonstration planned for the anniversary of last year's disputed presidential election, according to a statement posted on Facebook Thursday. The protests were to have taken place Saturday. Iranians went to the polls a year ago on that day, and when word of fraud surfaced, so did public outrage. Widespread unrest gripped the Islamic republic as protesters clashed with police. But the hard-line government's crackdown on the opposition -- known as the Green Movement and led by former presidential candidates Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi -- has been, at times, brutal. And the government has steadily been tightening its grip throughout the year, said a report issued Thursday by Human Right Watch, which has been monitoring the situation through interviews with people in Iran. The government and police had issued warnings to Iranians not to participate in any gatherings Saturday. A joint statement posted on Moussavi's Facebook page said that it was obvious to the opposition that if ""innocent and defenseless"" people took to the streets Saturday, they would once again be met with violence. Green Movement supporters have always said they seek democratic reforms and civil rights, not violence. ""By considering the report of the representatives of reformist parties and also for the safety of the people, we are announcing that the planned demonstration will not be held,"" the statement said. ""We ask the people and the protesters to demand and follow up on their rightful demands and requests through less costly and more effective methods."" Iran's anti-government demonstrations started out strong but have limped along in recent months as security forces have sought to silence the voices of dissent. Human Rights Watch said the current atmosphere inside the country is markedly different than the images of defiance that filled the internet and television screens starting a year ago. ""While the international community has focused on Iran's nuclear ambitions, Tehran has been methodically crushing all forms of dissent inside the country,"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""Journalists, lawyers, and civil society activists who used to speak to foreign media and human rights groups are increasingly reluctant, fearing phone and internet surveillance,"" he said in a statement released with the latest report. The rights group says that Iran's crackdown extends beyond election protesters. The 19-page report lists abuses including arbitrary arrests, extra-judicial killings, rapes, torture and violations of the rights to freedom of assembly and expression. Scores of journalists and human rights activists have been targeted, the report says, and the government has executed at least seven Kurdish political dissidents, while more than a dozen still sit on death row. Iran has defended its record before the United Nations Human Rights Council. Mohammad Javad Larijani, the secretary general of Iran's High Council for Human Rights, has said that the government only goes after those who incite violence. ""Nobody is jailed because of the protest,"" Larijani told CNN in February. ""The only reason for jailing is the violence which was attached with the protests. Any government has a duty to bring an end to the violence. I think the beating of our police is much more less than the New York and Los Angeles police."" Moussavi and Karrubi had called weeks ago for demonstrations on June 12, to mark the controversial election that returned hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the presidency. On Thursday, they rebutted claims that the opposition movement had been greatly diminished. ""The policy makers, more than anyone, realize this fact that the movement is alive and the true honor of it belongs to those who, despite all the threats and dangers, the insecurities and also knowing the potential life-threatening and financial consequences, still have not given up on their rightful protest,"" they said. Despite the call to cancel Saturday's demonstration, some Iranians told CNN they would go out on the streets if they see protests taking shape, making the scope of the protests, if any, difficult to predict.","Opposition leaders fear more violence if protests take place .

"(CNN) -- Justine Henin continued her winning return to tennis with a straight sets win over Kazakhstan's Sesil Karatantcheva at the WTA tournament in Brisbane on Wednesday. Henin, who put out second seed Nadia Petrova of Russia in her first round match, secured a 6-4 6-3 victory in one hour 17 minutes to reach the quarterfinals. The former world number one is returning to competitive tennis after an 18-month retirement and targeting the opening grand slam of 2010 at the Australian Open. She made a shaky start as she dropped her opening service game, but broke back and took total control with a second break against the determined qualifier in the eighth game. Henin also dropped service twice in the second set, but a run of five straight games set up victory, which she secured with a forehand winner. Her fellow Belgian and arch-rival Kim Clijsters reached the last eight of the top-tier tournament on Tuesday and could meet Henin in the final should both progress. Clijsters also made a comeback last summer after a two-year retirement and promptly won the U.S. Open, inspiring Henin to make a return. Clijsters will place Czech Lucie Safarova for a place in the semifinals after she beat sixth seed Aleksandra Wozniak of Canada 6-3 6-1 earlier on Wednesday. In the accompanying men's tournament in Brisbane, top seed Andy Roddick cruised into the quarterfinals of the Brisbane International with a 7-6 6-3 win over Australian Carsten Ball. Roddick showed he is fully recovered from the injuries which ruined his end of season campaign in 2009 with a confident display. He now faces Richard Gasquet, who stepped up his comeback after a drugs row derailed his career, with a 6-3 6-4 win over Australian Matthew Ebden 6-3 6-4.","Justine Henin continues comeback with straight sets win over Kazakhstan's Sesil Karatantcheva .

"(CNN) -- She is small but only in physical stature. Aung San Suu Kyi is the very embodiment of Myanmar's long struggle for democracy. The 65-year-old human rights activist has defied Myanmar's authoritarian military junta with her quiet demeanor and grace. For that she has endured house arrest for most of the past two decades and, perhaps, has become the world's most recognizable political prisoner. She has lived quietly by herself at her disintegrating Inya Lake villa in Yangon (the former capital, also known as Rangoon), accompanied solely by two maids. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate has had little outside human contact except for visits from her doctor. Sometimes, though, she has been able to speak over the wall of her compound to her supporters, never once giving up her crusade to break down the tyranny of dictatorship in her beloved homeland of Burma, the alternate name for Myanmar. Known as the ""lady"" in Myanmar, Suu Kyi has been compared to former South African President Nelson Mandela, who spent a chunk of his life in jail for fighting apartheid. In an interview with CNN, Suu Kyi, in fact, likened Myanmar's plight to South Africa's former brutal race-based system. ""It's a form of apartheid,"" she said. ""In Africa, it was apartheid based on color. Here, it is apartheid based on ideas. It is as though those who want democracy are somehow of an alien inferior breed and this is not so."" The daughter of Gen. Aung San, a hero of Burmese independence, Suu Kyi spent much of her early life abroad, going to school in India and at Oxford University in England. She never sought political office. Rather, leadership was bestowed upon her when she returned home in 1988 after her mother suffered a stroke. During her visit, a student uprising erupted and spotlighted her as a symbol of freedom. When Suu Kyi's mother died the next year, Suu Kyi vowed that just as her parents had served the people of Burma, so, too, would she. In her first public speech, she stood before a crowd of several hundred thousand people with her husband, Michael Aris, and her two sons and called for a democratic government. ""The present crisis is the concern of the entire nation,"" she said. ""I could not, as my father's daughter, remain indifferent to all that was going on. This national crisis could, in fact, be called the second struggle for independence."" She won over the Burmese people. The following year, the military regime threw her in jail. But even with Suu Kyi sitting behind bars, her National League for Democracy won the 1990 elections by a landslide, gaining 82 percent of the seats in parliament. The regime ignored the results of the vote and Senior Gen. Than Shwe continued to impose numerous terms of house arrest on her. Suu Kyi, meanwhile, became the recipient of several human rights prizes and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. Over the years, Suu Kyi has repeatedly challenged the junta and discouraged foreign investment in Myanmar. In one incident in 1998, soldiers prevented her from leaving Yangon. But Suu Kyi refused to turn back and was detained in her minivan for almost two weeks. The ordeal left her severely dehydrated, but was typical of her almost stubborn determination. ""She is the symbol of the hope for the people of Burma. If she is out today the whole country will rise up, will follow her,"" said Khin Omar of the Network for Democracy and Development. Over the years, Suu Kyi has made it clear that she remains devoted to bringing democracy to Myanmar. She has spoken of her separation from her loved ones as the sacrifice she chose to make for the freedom of her country. She has not seen her sons since 2000. The year before, her dying husband petitioned the Myanmar authorities to allow him to visit his wife. He had last seen her in 1995. His request was rejected. Instead, the junta encouraged Suu Kyi to join her family abroad. But she said she knew that if she left, she would never be allowed to return. Aris died of prostate cancer in March 1999. Even before they were married, Suu Kyi had penned a letter to Aris professing her love of country. ""I only ask one thing,"" she wrote, ""that should my people need me, you would help me to do my duty by them."" Suu Kyi tried to break the monotony of her life by playing her piano, another passion in her life, according to the independent Irrawaddy magazine. But the piano has been broken for years and she has taken up painting to fill the void, the magazine reported. One day, maybe, people will see her canvases. Suu Kyi has also asked her lawyers to bring her books in English and French. Last year, Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz was allowed to present her with his book ""Globalization and Its Discontent."" Again in 2007, people defiantly took to the streets to protest rising fuel costs. The demonstrations were seen as a direct challenge to the authority of the government. The regime answered with a brutal crackdown. Suu Kyi's detention was extended again and again. She appeared gaunt -- and unhappy. Even when Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar in May 2008, Suu Kyi was not allowed to leave her house, though trees were crashing down all around her. The following year, Myanmar was again propelled into the headlines by a bizarre incident involving an American, John Yettaw, who improvised flippers to swim Inya Lake to Suu Kyi's compound. He said he had received a message from God to do so. Yettaw was arrested, and Suu Kyi was put on trial, charged with harboring Yettaw, and was punished with another 18 months of house arrest. During the trial, she was able to meet with diplomats. High on her agenda was the election that was held this week. She and her party boycotted the vote, certain that it would be a sham. ""In Burma, the regime can control people but they cannot control her, they cannot shut her mouth,"" said analyst Win Min. ""They can release other political prisoners but they are worried that if they release her she will speak out."" The junta has organized national conventions to debate their version of a new democratic Myanmar. The road map makes no mention of Suu Kyi. Some believe that Suu Kyi's stubborn defiance has become an obstacle to progress in Myanmar. But her followers remain ardent in their admiration. She has clung to her dream of democracy, peace and freedom for Myanmar's 50 million impoverished people, they say. Those simple ideals have greatly complicated one woman's life. CNN's Dan Rivers and Moni Basu contributed to this report.","Aung San Suu Kyi has vowed to fight for freedom .

"(CNN) -- A wonder goal from Arjen Robben helped Bayern Munich snatch a 3-2 away victory over Werder Bremen which fired them back to the top of the German Bundesliga table for at least 24 hours. The Holland international winger lashed home a stunning second-half free-kick to give Louis van Gaal's side all three points in an enthralling encounter at the Weserstadion on Saturday. Bayern had fallen behind to a goal from Werder midfielder Aaron Hunt, who neatly slotted home from close range in the 10th minute, before they equalized through Thomas Mueller 15 minutes later after he had been set up by Bastian Schweinsteiger. Ivica Olic latched on to Philipp Lahm's cross in the 35th minute to put Bayern ahead as welcomed back France international Franck Ribery, who replaced Olic after halftime to make his first appearance for the Munich club since October having recovered from a knee injury. Werder, though, responded in the 75th minute when Portugal striker Hugo Almeida slotted home but they were on level terms for a matter of three minutes as Robben bent a superb free-kick past goalkeeper Tim Wiese and into the net. Coach van Gaal felt Bayern could have won by more goals as they went a point clear of Bayer Leverkusen who will return to the summit with a draw or better against Hoffenheim on Sunday. ""It's unbelievable we've only won 3-2. We should have won by a lot more. We've played well but missed far too many chances, which is a shame,"" van Gaal told the club's Web site. ""It meant the bench was a stressful place right to the end. But it's never easy against Werder Bremen."" Elsewhere, Schalke missed a chance to keep pace with the leaders as they conceded a 90th-minute equalizer from Bochum striker Stanislav Sestak to draw 2-2 having thrown away a two-goal lead following strikes from Vicente Sanchez and Kevin Kuranyi. Borussia Dortmund are now only three points behind Bayern after they claimed a narrow 1-0 win over fellow challengers Hamburg thanks to Nelson Valdez's goal while Nuremberg drew 1-1 at Eintracht Frankfurt. Elsewhere, Hertha Berlin were held 0-0 at home by Borussia Moenchengladbach and new Hanover boss Mirko Slomka got off to a losing start when his side were beaten 1-0 at mid-table Mainz while Stuttgart edged a 1-0 away win over Freiburg on Friday night.","A wonder goal from Arjen Robben helped Bayern Munich snatch a 3-2 away victory over Werder Bremen.

"(CNN) -- The explosive found hidden in a package on a plane in the United Arab Emirates on Friday may have traveled on passenger planes to get there, airline officials said Sunday. The explosive, along with a similar device found in the United Kingdom, appear to have been designed to detonate on their own, without someone having to set them off, the top White House counterterrorism official told CNN. ""It is my understanding that these devices did not need somebody to detonate them,"" said John Brennan, President Barack Obama's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism. U.S. investigators believe al Qaeda bomb maker Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, 28, is linked to that package and another one found on a second airplane in Britain's East Midlands Airport on Friday, a federal official, who was briefed by authorities, told CNN Sunday. Both packages were addressed to synagogues in Chicago, Illinois. Al-Asiri, who is thought to be in Yemen, is a Saudi who was high on Saudi Arabia's list of most wanted published in February 2009. He is also believed to be the bomber who designed last year's failed Christmas Day underwear bomb. Separately, an engineering student arrested in Yemen was released Sunday, along with her mother, according to her father, Mohammed Al-Samawi. She was earlier identified as Hanan Al-Samawi, a fifth-year student at Sanaa University in the Yemeni capital, said Abdul-Rahman Barman, a human rights attorney and activist who said he was asked to represent her. A high-level source in the United Arab Emirates said Hanan Al-Samawi's name was found on the cargo manifest of the device found in Dubai. Also arrested was her mother, Amatilullah Mohammed. Barman had said the mother's arrest was illegal and said holding the two in an undisclosed location was ""a criminal act."" Authorities do not have any American suspects at this time, a U.S. official said. Two schools in Yemen were being looked at in connection with the plot and had been on the radar of U.S. officials before, the official said. The explosive device found in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, was contained in a Hewlett-Packard printer, and had a motherboard originating from a mobile phone, but did not have a SIM card in it, the high-level source told CNN. The device was professionally assembled, the source said. The motherboard was connected by a striker to the printer head and then to the cartridge, which was filled with explosives. Authorities have the serial number of the motherboard and the printer, and are searching to see where it was sold, how it was paid for and what information they can glean about the people who performed those transactions, according to the source. Authorities believe an explosive device found at the United Kingdom's East Midlands airport flew from Yemen to a Persian Gulf state, then to Cologne, Germany, the official said. The device was then transferred onto a UPS plane. Investigators are still attempting to retrace the route of the Dubai device, according to the high-level official. Some believe it went to Doha, Qatar, on Qatar Airways, where it spent the night before traveling to Dubai the following day. However, it does appear the devices did fly on commercial passenger planes, the high-level official said. Screening the devices would have been difficult, since printers normally contain computer parts and wires, according to Richard Quest, CNN's aviation correspondent. Qatar Airways, which said earlier Sunday that it had flown the device from Yemen to Dubai for FedEx, is no longer certain that is true, a senior airline source said. The airline is investigating the possibility that the explosives flew on another airline after finding inconsistencies in information it was given, the source said. An airline spokesman said earlier that two Qatar Airways passenger planes had carried the package. Emirates Airways, which also flies from Yemen to the United Arab Emirates, said as far as it is aware, it had not carried the package. The package was being sent by FedEx, which uses other airlines to get parcels out of Yemen because it does not fly there itself. The two devices found Friday look like they were put together by the same bomber who designed last year's failed Christmas Day underwear bomb, a U.S. government official told CNN. ""The thinking is it's the same person or group of people that built the underwear bomb, because of the way it's put together,"" said the official, who had been briefed by multiple U.S. authorities and law enforcement sources. ""But this one is about four times as powerful."" American authorities are now endorsing British Prime Minister David Cameron's position that the explosives were designed to take down an airplane, the official said. However, a U.S. official said Sunday the United States has not drawn any conclusions on the intent of the bombs and whether they were intended to explode in flight, at the synagogues or somewhere else. American and British authorities think al Qaeda's branch in Yemen is linked to the plot. A key figure in the group is the American-born Yemeni militant cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, whom U.S. authorities have linked to Fort Hood shooting suspect Maj. Nidal Hasan and the man accused in the Christmas Day bomb attempt. Brennan on Friday declined to name al-Awlaki specifically as a suspect. ""Anybody who's associated with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is a subject of concern,"" he said. Yemen is investigating the shipping agency that sent the packages, its President Ali Abdullah Saleh said Saturday, based on information provided by the United States and United Kingdom, who in turn are getting tips from Saudi Arabia. The United Kingdom is sending a security team to help with Yemen's investigation, Saleh said. A specific explosive was found in both Friday's devices and in the foiled underwear bomb attempt in 2009, a source close to the investigation said. It's a highly explosive organic compound called PETN, which belongs to the same chemical family as nitroglycerin, the source said. Six grams of PETN are enough to blow a hole in the fuselage of an aircraft. PETN was allegedly one of the components of the bomb concealed by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, the Nigerian man accused of trying to set off a bomb hidden in his underwear aboard a Northwest Airlines flight as it approached Detroit, Michigan, on December 25. ""The quantity of PETN in these [new] devices was about five times the volume used at Christmas"" by AbdulMutallab, Col. Richard Kemp, the former chairman of the British government's Cobra Intelligence Group, told CNN affiliate ITN. Yemen's president said his country is cooperating with the U.S., the U.K., and Saudi Arabia. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration is sending six inspectors to Yemen to help improve cargo security, an official with the agency said Sunday. ""Even before this incident, 100 percent of identified high-risk cargo on inbound passenger planes was being screened,"" TSA Administrator John S. Pistole said in a statement Sunday, noting that security procedures will evolve based on the latest intelligence information. Over the past several months, Yemen, which wants to be seen as a committed partner in the fight against terrorism, has launched several offensives against al Qaeda in its country, but has not captured al-Awlaki. ""We acknowledge that we have a problem with terrorism, specifically the presence of al Qaeda, and we continue to pay a high price,"" Saleh said. The Yemeni government imposed new security measures at local airports, the SABA news agency said Sunday, including ""unusual check methods on outgoing packages from Yemeni airports."" Meanwhile, U.S. authorities were grateful for a tip from Yemen's oil-rich neighbor, Saudi Arabia, alerting them to the suspicious packages. Saudi officials provided tracking numbers of the two packages, enabling quick tracing to the United Kingdom and Dubai, a source told CNN. CNN's Bharati Naik, Caroline Paterson, Jeanne Meserve, Mohammed Jamjoom, Susan Candiotti and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: The TSA administrator says security procedures will evolve based on latest intelligence .

"(CNN)  -- Indian cricket star Sachin Tendulkar has been included in his country's 15-man World Cup squad, despite doubts over the opener's fitness ahead of next month's competition. Tendulkar was forced to withdraw from India's ongoing tour of South Africa on Saturday after straining his right hamstring. The 37-year-old has scored a record 17,629 runs in 444 one-day internationals, but has played just four over the last 12 months in order to focus on Test cricket. However, the world's leading one-day and Test batsman was named in the squad for the February 19 to April 2 tournament, which is to be jointly hosted by India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Cook not hopeful of England World Cup place . The south east Asian nation's one-day side -- currently level with South Africa at one game a piece in the best-of-five match series -- have also been missing batsmen Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir as well as fast bowler Praveen Kumar through injury. ""I am not worried at all about the injuries, these are part of the game,"" Krishnamachari Srikkanth, India's chairman of selectors told reporters in Chennai following the team announcement on Monday. ""I am confident the team will be fully fit when the World Cup starts,"" he added. India hold second place behind Australia in the official one-day rankings, ahead of co-hosts Sri Lanka, England and South Africa. Led by captain and wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, India have been drawn with England, the West Indies, Bangladesh, Ireland, the Netherlands and South Africa in group B of cricket's 10th World Cup. Defending champions Australia head group A with Pakistan, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Canada and Kenya completing the line up for the tournament.

"(CNN)  -- Proving that the Wii's motion-sensing controls weren't a fad, both Sony's PlayStation Move and Microsoft's Kinect had strong holiday seasons, suggesting a growing appetite for active video games. Sony and Microsoft sold more than 4.1 million and 8 million units over the holidays, respectively, on the strength of titles like ""Sports Champions"" and ""Dance Central."" And as a host of new compatible offerings illustrate, both these and other manufacturers hope to further expand the market for gesture-tracking gaming systems throughout 2011 and beyond. Here's a look at what's coming in the months ahead. PlayStation Move . Like the Wii, the Move system features a wand-like controller that gamers wave about to control their avatars onscreen. Angling to entice hard-core players as well as casual game enthusiasts, Sony's upcoming 3D TV-enabled sci-fi shooter ""Killzone 3"" and military-themed blaster ""SOCOM 4: U.S. Navy SEALs"" both will feature PlayStation Move support. Each offers more intuitive aiming through physical gestures, and looks to make a case for how well this new tech can integrate with more die-hard gameplay experiences. Titles with a more mainstream focus like ""MLB 11: The Show"" (batting), ""PlayStation Move Heroes"" (arcade mini-games), ""LittleBigPlanet 2"" (platform hopping) and ""Sorcery"" (spell casting via a plastic wand) are also planned. And nearly 50 titles in all genres, from adventure to sports to downloadable PlayStation Network games and third-party outings such as ""Time Crisis: Razing Storm,"" are now available for the Move. Kinect . Microsoft's hit system, which uses cameras to read players' full-body movements and translate them into action or sports games, will extend its immediate focus to a range of social applications. Announced at CES, the company's new Kinect Avatar service utilizes the hands-free controller to allow real-time mapping of facial movements onto a digital character. When you raise your eyebrow, so does your avatar. Up to eight virtual avatars, all reflecting their users' actual facial expressions, can hang out in virtual chat rooms -- including performance stages and other imaginative environments -- via Xbox Live. You can even record videos of their conversations. The Kinect also will feature such motion-controlled entertainment options as casual videoconferencing and, come spring, the ability to use hand gestures and voice commands to enjoy streaming video from Netflix and Hulu Plus. New upcoming titles for the Kinect, which cover a range of interests and play styles, include psychedelic shooter ""Child of Eden,"" automotive epic ""Forza Motorsport 4"" and the humorous trivia game ""You Don't Know Jack."" Tablets, PCs and handheld 3-D . New gyroscope-equipped tablet PCs such as Motorola's Xoom, Acer's new Android slate and Apple's rumored iPad 2 also promise potential new ways to bring motion controls to handheld gaming. Expect more titles that, like some popular iPhone games, let you tilt to steer on-screen vehicles, pilot dogfighting planes or aim virtual cross hairs. Motion controls manufacturer Softkinetic also plans to offer controller-free games shortly through its proprietary ""iisu"" 3-D gesture-recognition technology. PC gamers can soon enjoy motion control capability outside of racing chairs and plastic putting simulators. Sixense's Hydra controller, which uses a magnetic field to detect your movements, is due in April, packaged with the popular puzzle game ""Portal 2."" The Nintendo 3DS, a handheld gaming system capable of producing three-dimensional special effects without the need for special glasses, will include touchscreen controls and dozens of custom games when it arrives March 27. From touch-sensing Android smartphones to gesture-tracking TV remotes and accessories like Nyko's Power Shot, which transforms the PlayStation Move into a plastic rifle, motion controls will be everywhere in 2011. What's next for these technologies appears to be a broader range of everyday uses that more inventively tap into the power of your own body -- the most intuitive controller of all.","Sony's PlayStation Move and Microsoft's Kinect systems had strong holiday seasons .

"Toronto, Canada (CNN) -- Police said they were preparing for more disruptions Sunday after groups of protesters burned cars, hurled bricks and smashed windows as they tried to penetrate the fence surrounding the G-20 summit. ""I do not believe that the individuals bent on vandalism and violence in our city have finished with their intent, so we will remain vigilant,"" Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair said Saturday night. More than 300 people were arrested Saturday, and 412 have been arrested since June 18, said Jillian Van Acker, spokeswoman for the Integrated Security Unit. There were no reports of serious injuries to either protesters or police, she said. Blair told reporters that packs of disruptive demonstrators infiltrated peaceful protests in order to cause chaos and distract police. ""These criminals rely on the anonymity of hiding in a larger group of the curious and the naive,"" he said. At least four police cars went up in flames and smoke during hours of confrontation. Protesters left behind broken windows and graffiti. Blair said police used tear gas after warning a group of protesters ""engaged in acts of destruction"" Saturday. But not all encounters between police and protesters were hostile. At one intersection the crowd danced and chanted, ""You're sexy, you're cute, take off your riot suit!"" More aggressive groups of demonstrators moved from intersection to intersection, trying to circumvent police and get to the security fence protecting the summit meeting. ""The fence is a symbol that they can build a fence and spend a billion dollars on their agenda. The fence is a symbol of what's wrong with this country,"" protester Rolf Gerstenberger said. Everywhere the protesters went, police were waiting to head them off, in some cases with individual blasts of pepper spray, tear gas and bean bag pellets, according to the summit's security unit. Authorities said the fence was not breached Saturday. Behind it, world leaders began an economic summit focusing on recovery from the global financial crisis. As they prepared for Sunday's scheduled meetings, the U.N. chief urged them to remember that the world's poor need help making ends meet now more than ever. ""Let me emphasize this evening that, under any circumstances we must not balance budgets on the backs of the world's poorest people,""  U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. Ban said countries should invest in agriculture, green recovery jobs and health. On Saturday, European Union Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso stressed that European leaders were already taking action to strengthen their economies and deal with a weakening euro caused by public debt woes. ""There should be no doubts. Europe will do whatever it takes to assure the financial stability of the euro,"" he told CNN. This weekend's meetings come on the heels of the two-day G8 summit outside Toronto, where the leaders of the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Japan and Russia also focused on recovery from the global economic crisis. The group also made note of other thorny issues in their final statement issued Saturday, singling out Iran and North Korea for criticism.

"(CNN) -- Andrea Pirlo has ended speculation that he will join Chelsea by announcing that he has been taken off the transfer market by AC Milan and hopes to stay with the Serie A side for the rest of his career. Andrea Pirlo hopes to help AC Milan overcome the loss of Paolo Maldini and Kaka this season. The Italy midfielder has been linked with a move to the big-spending English Premier League club since coach Carlo Ancelotti quit Milan at the end of May and agreed to take over from Guus Hiddink at Stamford Bridge. The 30-year-old revealed on the Milan Web site that new team boss Leonardo was happy to keep him at the San Siro. ""Today is a great day, I'm very happy to be able to end my career here,"" Pirlo said on Thursday. ""This is thanks to president Silvio Berlusconi, Adriano Galliani and Leonardo who have given me the possibility to end my career here by taking me off the market. ""When they communicated this news to me, we were all happy. Finally this story ends and I can continue my adventure with the Rossoneri. ""There was a possibility of changing teams, but in the end the club and I agreed to continue together and we're all happier. It was an eventful summer with many doubts, but in the end my family are happy to stay in Milan."" Pirlo, who joined Milan from city rivals Inter in 2001, said that as a senior player he felt responsibility for maintaining the club's momentum following the retirement of legendary defender Paolo Maldini and the sale of star player Kaka to Real Madrid. ""Milan's history must continue to be winning. Us older players must take more responsibility and give everyone great satisfactions. The President has talked to us and he wants the story to continue, so we restart with great enthusiasm,"" he said.

"(CNN)  -- Didier Drogba muscled his way through for a late winner to put Chelsea into the FA Cup final with a 2-1 victory over Arsenal at Wembley on Saturday. A bare-chested Drogba is congratulated by Salomon Kalou after scoring the winner at Wembley. The all-London clash rarely hit the heights on a difficult pitch, but Drogba's 84th minute strike gave Guus Hiddink's men a deserved victory and leaves them in contention for three trophies. Dutchman Hiddink, who took temporary charge of the Blues in February and has lost only one match, said Drogba had proved his worth again. ""He is proving already he is so dangerous, very strong and physically fit,"" he told Press Association. ""We respect each other very much but also challenge each other without thinking this is a big name."" Arsenal went ahead in the 18th minute as Theo Walcott's volley deflected past Petr Cech, but Florent Malouda equalized for Chelsea just after the half hour mark. Chelsea looked the stronger against an Arsenal team missing key defenders and goalkeeper Manuel Almunia and it came as no surprise when Ivory Coast star Drogba scored a typical winner. He latched on to Frank Lampard's hopeful volleyed through ball, shrugged off Mikael Silvestre before rounding Lukasz Fabianksi to roll the ball into an empty net. Ivory Coast international Drogba scored the winning goal against Manchester United in the 2007 FA Cup final and may get the chance to repeat the trick. Quintuple chasing United play Everton in the second semifinal, also at Wembley, on Sunday. Chelsea, who are a still challenging third in the Premier League and semifinals of the Champions League, showed their character after falling behind to Walcott's strike. The England international winger connected with a chipped cross from Kieran Gibbs and his effort took a cruel deflection off Ashley Cole's arm to beat Cech. Arsenal had made a fine start, but without injured central defender William Gallas and with Fabianski showing a lack of authority in goal, Chelsea came back strongly into the game. Malouda went close with a cross shot which eluded Fabianski, but he was not be denied soon afterwards as picked out by Lampard he cut inside Emmanuel Eboue and beat Fabianski at his near post. More slack defending from Denilson allowed Nicolas Anelka time to shoot and his shot hit the post with Fabianski beaten. Walcott looked occasionally dangerous on the flank and twice sent in crosses which might have been converted, but Chelsea looked the more threatening and the teams were spared extra time when Drogba powered through to score. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was left to rue their defensive errors and the performance of his 20-year-old Polish goalkeeper. ""He's a great goalkeeper but it was not his greatest day,"" Wenger said. ""Inexperience, yes. It was a game when any mistake could be costly.""","Didier Droba winner ends Arsenal's long unbeaten run and puts Chelsea in final .

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Tunisian opposition leaders joined the current ruling party Monday in a new government to replace the country's ousted president, while U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for a return to stability ""as soon as possible."" The government will be led by current Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi, who took charge of the North African country when longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled last week. Ghannouchi's 19-member Cabinet will include three opposition leaders and 10 independents, he announced Monday. The new government will be tasked with leading Tunisia toward new elections, he said. Street clashes continued in Tunis on Monday, three days after Ben Ali's departure, with police firing tear gas into crowds of demonstrators in Tunis. Ban called on the new government to restore stability and the rule of law ""as soon as possible."" Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia on Friday after ruling the country for 23 years. His ouster followed weeks of protest over what Tunisians said were poor living conditions, high unemployment, government corruption and repression. Fouad Mebazaa, a former parliament speaker, was named acting president Saturday. He promised to restore stability and respect the constitution of the North African country. Speaking in Abu Dhabi, Ban told reporters the new government should protect human rights and guarantee freedom of speech and association. But he said he remained ""extremely concerned"" about the ongoing clashes in the streets. ""This is a moment for the Tunisian people to strengthen the country's longstanding culture of political moderation and its attachment to peace,"" he said. ""I call on the government and all stakeholders to ensure a prompt restoration of the rule of law, and to respect and accommodate the aspirations of the people. Tunisia must regain its stability as soon as possible, to pursue the path of development and prosperity."" The new government includes opposition leaders Mustafa Ben Jaafar, who will serve as health minister; Ahmad Ibrahim, education minister; and Ahmad Najib Al Shabi, minister of local development. Among the holdovers is Ahmad Friaa, the interior minister. Friaa, speaking later on state TV, said 78 people have died in the clashes across several weeks and 94 have been injured, among them many police officers. He urged people to stop riots and to work with police. He vowed that those who should be held responsible for mistakes of the past will be punished. And Friaa ended his speech saying, ""Yes for democracy, yes freedom, no for chaos."" Friaa also said the cost of the turmoil of recent weeks is 3 billion Tunisian dinars (about 1.6 billion euros, about $2 billion U.S.). The announcements came a day after the country's army clashed with armed gangs and remnants of Ben Ali's personal guard. Police have arrested looters and as many as two dozen of the ousted president's relatives since Friday. Public protests continued Monday, as about two thousand people packed into a major road in Tunis. As the demonstrators tried to work their way toward the headquarters of the ruling party, police opened fire with tear gas. Opposition officials told CNN there were other peaceful demonstrations in towns in central and southern Tunisia. Tunisia's unrest was triggered by the December suicide of an unemployed college graduate, who set himself ablaze after police confiscated the fruit cart that was his source of income. Recent diplomatic cables from the U.S. Embassy in Tunisia, disclosed by the WikiLeaks website, revealed growing discontent with what Tunisians believed was widespread corruption and nepotism within Ben Ali's government. Experts say the kinds of protests seen in Tunisia could inspire similar actions, particularly by unemployed young people, in other Arab nations. In the weekend's chaos, a group of Swedish hunters visiting Tunisia said Monday they were stopped on the streets near Kasserine and beaten. Some of the men's eyes were swollen and blood-filled. One man had apparently been beaten on the back. Another man had a head injury. ""To be fair, when we look back, we can understand that our guns scared them,"" said one of the men, Ove Oberg, who met with CNN Monday morning. The men said by the time the army came and understood the hunters were tourists, they had been badly beaten. ""If the army didn't find us, we would have been dead,"" Magnus Josefsson said. Mohamed Guiga, a witness to Sunday's clash between government troops and Ben Ali's loyalists, said most Tunisians have rallied to each other's aid since the uprising. ""We are proud of those people -- simple people, young people, normal people -- who take care of each other,"" Guiga said. CNN's Rima Maktabi, Ben Wedeman, Per Nyberg, Matt Smith and Neil Curry contributed to this report.","NEW: U.N. secretary-general is ""extremely concerned"" about ongoing clashes .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- China on Tuesday continued its diatribe against Japan over the arrest of a Chinese fishing captain and demanded his immediate release. ""Japan provoked this situation and Japan should take all responsibilities,"" said Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Jiang Yu. ""We urge the Japanese to stop so-called legal procedures and let him return safely and immediately."" The captain's fishing trawler crashed into two Japanese patrol boats last week off the disputed Diaoyu Islands, in the East China Sea. He remains in custody, accused of obstructing Japanese public officers while they performed duties. On Monday, his 14 crew members returned to China. The Japanese coast guard freed the crew members after completing an investigation, a coast guard official told CNN. Their detention angered Beijing, which repeatedly summoned the Japanese ambassador, demanding their release. Beijing says the Diaoyu Islands and most of the South China Sea belong to China, disputing neighboring countries' claims. The clash over territorial waters and islands -- and the natural resources that go with them -- is a flashpoint in the Asia-Pacific region. ""Chinese people have expressed strong indignation to this, and this fully embodies the Chinese people's resolve to defend national sovereignty,"" Yu said. ""The islands has sovereign rights, and no one can change that fact."" ""If you read history documents, Chinese first discovered the island and put it in effective administration,"" Yu added. Word of the fishermen's arrest has led to irate reactions from some of the Chinese public, as seen in online posts. On Sunday, a Japanese school in northeastern China was fired on with small BBs, presumably in connection with the fishermen's arrest. The Japanese Embassy in China said: ""We have received report from Japanese School of Tianjin. The Japanese Embassy contacted relevant departments of Chinese government, requiring relevant departments to strengthen security at the school, to guarantee the safety of the students at Japanese School, as well as all the Japanese in Tianjin."" ""So far, we haven't heard that anyone is injured, and we haven't got any result of the investigation,"" the embassy added.","Japan is illegally holding the captain, China says .

The fourth-seed Williams had not lost a set to the Czech in any of their four previous meetings, but Zahlavova remedied that when she claimed the first thanks to a tie break. After falling behind, the 30-year-old Williams required treatment in the locker room after picking up a groin injury and returned with the area heavily strapped to win the final two sets of the match. Williams, who is playing in only her second tournament since the 2010 Wimbledon championships after struggling with a knee injury, recorded her win in three hours and one minute. ""I wasn't very happy, to say the least,"" the American said of her injury on the tournament's website. ""I mean, with an injury like that, you just don't know what to expect.

"(CNN) -- Music producer and promoter Don Kirshner, who found songs for The Monkees to sing and whose live TV rock show helped wean 1970s audiences off lip-synched programming, died Monday in Boca Raton, Florida, his publicist confirmed Tuesday. Kirshner, 76, died of heart failure, according to Sharon Ellman of the public relations firm Dash Media. A renowned song publisher and rock producer, Kirshner is best known for managing the songwriting talent behind the successful pop music television series ""The Monkees,"" and for his signature TV program, ""Don Kirshner's Rock Concert."" He achieved his first major success in the late 1950s and early 1960s as co-owner with Al Nevin of the influential New York-based publishing company Aldon Music. The firm had under contract several of the most important songwriters of the so-called Brill Building, including Carole King, Neil Sedaka, Howard Greenfield, Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann. As a producer-promoter, Kirshner was influential in igniting the careers of artists such as Bobby Darin, Neil Diamond and Tony Orlando, as well as discovering rock acts such as Kansas. As a publisher, Kirshner was behind hits such as ""You've Lost That Loving Feeling"" and ""Where The Boys Are."" Barbra Streisand, Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra were among the many performers who recorded Kirshner-produced songs. In 1966, Kirshner, who had supervised the music for the sitcoms ""I Dream of Jeannie"" and ""Bewitched,"" was hired by the producers of ""The Monkees"" to provide hit-worthy songs to accompany the TV program. Within a demanding time frame, he quickly corralled songwriting talent to craft catchy tunes for the show, which became a smash hit among teen audiences. In September 1973, Kirshner created, produced, and eventually hosted his own syndicated, weekly rock-concert program, ""Don Kirshner's Rock Concert."" The show's long-form, live performances distinguished it from the often lip-synched fare typical among TV music performances up to that time. The show aired until 1981 and featured performances from many of the big-name acts of that era, including The Rolling Stones, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Fleetwood Mac, the Bee Gees, the Police, Stevie Wonder and David Bowie. Kirshner was inducted into the Songwriters' Hall of Fame in 2007. He is survived by his wife of 50 years, Sheila, two children and five grandchildren.","""Don Kirshner's Rock Concert"" set the standard for live TV performances .

"(CNN) -- More countries pledged aid to Taiwan on Friday, days after Typhoon Morakot battered the island and left dozens of villages deluged with floodwaters, killing 116 people. This image from an ireporter emphasizes the damage inflicted by Typhoon Morakot. Officials from Hong Kong said they would recommend sending HK$50 million (US$6.45 million) in aid. The aid request needed to get final authorization. Once that happens Hong Kong will join a growing group of countries and territories that have rushed to help typhoon-battered Taiwan. More than 30 countries have offered money, helicopters, medication or other supplies. ""They have presented the goodwill to help,"" said Benjamin Chi, a government spokesman.

Torrential downpours, dense fog, rugged terrain and raging rivers have made rescues difficult. Washed out roads and bridges rendered ground rescue operations virtually impossible in the central and southern regions of the island.

In some cases food drops have been conducted over isolated villages tucked amid the rugged terrain, as villagers sought higher ground to stay dry. The Central Weather Bureau in Taiwan said that over a one-day period after the typhoon hit, Pingtung County received a record 55 inches of rain (1,403 mm). Elsewhere on the island, rainfall amounts were as high as 83 inches (2,108 mm). Seattle, Washington, one of the wettest U.S. cities, has an average annual rainfall of 37 inches per year (940 mm). The storm primarily targeted southern Taiwan. Isolated scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast for Taiwan overnight Thursday into Friday, mostly in the north, where the capital is located, said CNN International meteorologist Brandon Miller. ""As a whole, the weather actually is pretty good,"" he said. It was 90 degrees (31C) late Thursday. Miller said Taipei had had ""significant rainfall"" of 5 or 6 inches (150 mm) over the past two days. The Red Cross is helping the government dispense food, water and other necessities from a central command center, where helicopters pick up the supplies for their humanitarian missions, said organization spokesman Christian Li on Wednesday. Economic losses due to Morakot have been estimated at U.S. $274 million. After hitting Taiwan, Morakot roared on to mainland China on Sunday, killing at least six people and displacing 1.4 million, authorities said.

"(CNN)  -- Bayern Munich eliminated fellow European powerhouses Juventus from this season's Champions League with a superb 4-1 win in Turin on Tuesday night. David Trezeguet put Juventus in front after just 19 minutes, but Bayern goalkeeper Hans Jorg Butt equalized with an impudent penalty just before halftime with Croatian Ivica Olic scoring the second on 51 minutes. Mario Gomez and substitute Anatoliy Tymoshchuk rounded off a brilliant display from Louis van Gaal's men with two late clinching goals. The victory sees the German giants qualify in Group A behind Bordeaux, who beat Maccabi Haifa 1-0 in the night's other match with Brazilian forward Jussie scoring the only goal of the game. Juventus went into the game at the Stade Communale with a point advantage over Bayern and looked set for the last 16 as French international Trezeguet ut them ahead with a volleyed goal. But Butt, who is proviing an expert from the spot, sent Gianluigi Buffon the wrong way after Martin Caceres fouled Olic. The second half saw Bayern continue to make the better chances and Olic gave them a deserved lead as Olic fired home from close range. The late goals were the icing on the cake and defeat piles the pressure on Juve coach Ciro Ferrara. In Group B, a makeshift Manchester United, who were playing with only one recognized defender, clinched top spot with a 3-1 win at VfL Wolsburg as Michael Owen grabbed an opportunist hat-trick. Owen put United ahead just before halftime with a glancing header from a Nani cross after a fine team move. Wolfsburg were more threatening after the break with the prolific Edin Dzeko equalizing with a fine strike to enhance his growing reputation ahead of the January transfer window. But Owen showed his predatory instincts with an 83rd minute second after a brilliant run and cross by substitute Gabriel Obertan. Wolfsburg defender Sascha Riether missed a cast-iron chance to equalize and put his side into the knockout stage, but United broke away and Owen completed his hat-trick. ""My scoring a hat-trick will probably make the headllines, but it was a great team display,"" Owen told Sky Sports after enhancing his claims for an England recall with clinical finishing. CSKA Moscow took second in the group behind United with a 2-1 win against  Besiktas in Istanbul as Yevgeny Aldonin scored the winning goal in the fifth minute of injury time. But the Russians are facing a UEFA disciplinary investigation after two of their players, defenders Aleksei Berezutski and Sergei Ignashevich, failed a doping test for a banned stimulant after the 3-3 draw with Manchester United in an earlier group game. UEFA said on its official Web site that it would rule on the situation on December 17, but could take action against CSKA because more than one player was involved, giving Wolfsburg hope they could yet go through.","Bayern Munich beat Juventus 4-1 in Turin to qualify in second from Group A behind Bordeaux .

"(CNN) -- A man authorities believe was the last person to see a missing Texas cheerleader is the focus of the investigation and his attorney said he has offered all the information he knows. Shawn Adkins, the live-in boyfriend of Hailey Dunn's mother, is the only named person of interest in the girl's December disappearance, authorities said Wednesday. Adkins' attorney, Sidney Lyle of Odessa, told CNN affiliate KTAB in Abilene he has advised his client not to speak further with the media. And he told affiliate KTXS that Adkins has cooperated with law enforcement. Lyle did not respond to CNN's attempts to talk to him. There have been no arrests in the disappearance of the Colorado City girl, 13, but police consider the case a criminal investigation. Two volunteer organizations have recently joined the search. City Manager Pete Kampfer, who serves as spokesman for the police, told CNN Wednesday there are other persons of interest but ""there are more things that relate"" to Adkins. He would not provide specifics. Adkins has not spoken with police since getting a lawyer, he said. Affidavits in the case indicate Hailey's mother, Billie Dunn, and Adkins failed polygraph exams on Hailey's whereabouts. According to the affidavits, Adkins ended two polygraph exams by walking out. On the third try, he failed the initial part of the test, but he then ""made a positive indication"" that the girl could be found in Scurry County, Texas. Dunn said Adkins was on anxiety medication at the time of the first test. Dunn was under the influence of narcotics on her first polygraph examination, and she failed the second, according to a law enforcement affidavit posted on the website of KTAB. Adkins was the last person to see the eighth-grader on December 27 at Dunn's home, according to local reports. Colorado City -- a rural central Texas town with about 5,000 residents -- is about 70 miles west of Abilene, Texas. Hailey was reported missing by her mother December 28. The Colorado City Police Department responded to a domestic dispute in February 2010 after Adkins allegedly threatened Billie and Hailey Dunn, the released documents show. Adkins confirmed he did make the threats, according to documents. KTAB on Wednesday posted three 911 calls on its website from the February incident. The calls referred to threats made against Billie Dunn and her estranged husband, Clint, but not against Hailey, the station said. In one 911 call, Billie Dunn said, ""I broke up with this guy a couple days ago and he's a little 'MHMR.' He's telling me that he's going to kill me and my ex-husband. And it's going to be remembered for a long time."" MHMR can refer to ""mental health and mental retardation."" Asked about the 911 calls and affidavits, Kampfer said, ""They add to the case against Shawn."" Billie Dunn told HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" Wednesday night that she did not report that Adkins had threatened to kill Hailey. Marc Klaas, founder of KlaasKids Foundation, a child safety advocacy group that is assisting in the search for Hailey, appeared on ""Nancy Grace"" with Billie Dunn. He indicated someone not identified in the case might have come into the town and abducted the girl. Klaas created the foundation in 1994 after the kidnapping and murder of his daughter, Polly. Investigators have found evidence both in Colorado City and in other locations, said Kampfer, a former special agent with the FBI. Dunn has said she has no idea what happened to her daughter. ""Somebody knows where she is,"" she told HLN last week. The mother told HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" Tuesday that investigators took bedsheets belonging to Hailey. Kampfer would not confirm that, but did say Dunn was given an inventory list of items taken by police from the home. Meanwhile, KTXS said that Hailey Dunn's older brother has been taken into temporary custody of Child Protective Services. Kampfer said it is common practice to remove a child when a situation like this occurs, the station said. Billie Dunn met Adkins on the MySpace social networking site more than two years ago, and he moved in with her several months ago. Kampfer described the family situation as unstable. Hailey is 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 120 pounds. She has hazel eyes and brown hair with blond streaks. When she disappeared, she was wearing navy blue sweatpants, a light-colored short-sleeve T-shirt and pink and white tennis shoes. Investigators, meanwhile, continue to work through leads. ""It's a smaller circle,"" Kampfer said of the evidence. ""We are growingly concerned about her status,"" he said of Hailey. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.

"(CNN)  -- A second half goal from Nilmar gave Brazil to a 1-0 victory over an understrength England in a prestige friendly international in Doha on Saturday. The slender margin of defeat flattered England, with Luis Fabiano missing a penalty shortly after the breakthrough goal and Brazil captain Lucio crashing a shot against the post. In uncomfortable heat in the Qatar capital, Brazil always had the edge against and England team missing John Terry, his defensive partners Rio Ferdinand and Ashley Cole and midfield stars Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard. Wayne Rooney was handed the captaincy armband by Fabio Capello and gave a wholehearted performance, nearly giving his side the lead in the opening moments as he just failed to get a touch on an inviting cross by Shaun Wright-Phillips. But there were few other attacking moments for England in the first half and their goal was twice threatened as stand-in central defender Matthew Upson twice lost possession in dangerous positions. A shot screwed wide by Felipe Melo and Nilmar's failure to find a teammate with his cross left his mistakes unpunished. England goalkeeper Ben Foster was also forced to make saves from Michel Bastos and the influential Kaka. Capello would have been happy to see his makeshift men go into the break still level but the effort was undone in the 46th minute as Elano's clever cross underlined poor marking and Nilmar stepped in to head past Foster. England should have fallen two behind after Wes Brown's mistake left Fabiano clear and he was brought down by his Manchester United teammate Foster. He was lucky to escape a red card but then watched as Fabiano made a woeful hash of the penalty. James Milner had a half-chance at the far post from another Wright-Phillips before Lucio found space to thump a shot which beat Foster and crashed against the post. England at least pressed in the closing stages but could not forge a clear chance against the five-time World Cup winners. Capello attempted to put a brave face on a lackluster display by his men. ""I think we played against a Brazil team who have the best XI in the world,"" he told ITV Sport. ""My first XI will be better than this one. But I found a lot of things positive."" European champions Spain beat Diego Maradona's Argentina 2-1 in an action-packed friendly at the Vicente Calderon stadium in Madrid. Real Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso scored two goals -- including an 86th-minute penalty -- to secure a home victory. Spain took the lead in the 16th minute after Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero saved David Silva's angled shot only for Alonso to capitalize on the rebound. Lionel Messi equalized with a penalty just after the hour mark after Raul Albiol had been fouled. But Martin Demichelis handled in his own penalty area with four minutes left and Alonso netted the winner. Another prestige friendly saw World Cup title holders Italy and the Netherlands draw 0-0 in Pescara in a game of few chances. Home goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon became the fourth player to win 100 caps for Italy as he kept a clean sheet.","Brazil beat England 1-0 in friendly international in Doha on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- American taxpayers have forked over around half a trillion dollars to U.S. intelligence services since the 9/11 attacks, yet nearly a decade after al Qaeda assaults on New York and Washington, the American intelligence community still cannot answer the most basic of questions: . Where is Osama bin Laden? Where is his top deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri? And where is Taliban leader Mullah Omar? As reported by CNN on Monday, NATO officials believe al Qaeda's leaders are hiding somewhere in northwestern Pakistan, while Mullah Omar is thought to orbit between Quetta in western Pakistan and the southern port city of Karachi. As Pakistan is roughly twice as large as California and Karachi is a city of 18 million, these are not particularly precise locations for the world's most wanted men. If the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies were private companies and were chronically unable to accomplish one of their key missions, their shareholders would have long ago revolted, fired their management and their stock would be trading at values near zero. Instead, the budgets for the U.S. intelligence agencies continue to spiral upward, while almost a million Americans possess top-secret clearances. What does a top-secret clearance gain you? Not much, judging by the content of the tens of thousands of secret documents about the Afghan War made public by WikiLeaks in July. The one surprising thing about this massive classified data dump was how little of it was in any way surprising. It contained the kind of material that the casual reader of news articles have long known: Elements of Pakistan's military intelligence service may be supporting the Taliban! The dirty little secret of the intelligence world is that much of what you really need to know isn't exactly a secret anyway. Bin Laden declared war on the United States on CNN in 1997 and then again on ABC News a year later, and he soon made good on those threats with al Qaeda's attacks on two U.S. embassies in Africa and the bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen. In the summer of 2001, bin Laden and his top commanders gave an interview to the Middle East Broadcasting Corp., in which they dropped broad hints that they were planning a large-scale, anti-American assault, which turned out to be the 9/11 attacks. When President George W. Bush was briefed by the CIA a month before 9/11 that bin Laden intended to attack the United States, it was merely to state the blindingly obvious. Similarly today, al Qaeda and allied groups such as the Taliban constantly release videotapes and print products in which they lay out their doctrines and strategies and document their attacks and tactics, all of which are widely available on the Internet. The conflict with al Qaeda and its allies is effectively the first open-source war, which is the opposite of how the highly secretive Kremlin conducted the Cold War. Yet U.S. intelligence agencies remain largely configured as if they are doing battle with a superpower, rather than a network of jihadist networks. As a result, the CIA today more resembles an accounting firm than the swashbuckling, action-oriented spy agency of popular imagination. This is not an accident. Hiring by the CIA and other agencies in the intelligence community is predicated on passing a background check that has become more onerous since 9/11 and is a legacy of the Cold War notion that a superpower adversary with billions of dollars at its disposal is trying to recruit spies and informants. But al Qaeda has no capacity to buy spies inside America's intelligence community, and, more broadly, al Qaeda and its allies have shown no ability to recruit inside the U.S. government. Yet applicants to the American intelligence agencies today are likely to encounter real problems with their background checks if they have relatives in the Arab world or have  spent time in countries such as Pakistan, precisely the sort of life experiences necessary for effective spies. By contrast, the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor of the CIA, recruited bilingual agents deeply familiar with European culture who took great risks to undertake highly effective operations in Nazi-occupied Europe. In today's CIA, those brave men and women wouldn't have made it past the background check. Much of the work that has been done to reform the intelligence community since 9/11 has been directed at fussing with the wiring diagram of its bureaucracy: Should the director of National Intelligence control CIA station chiefs, or is that the purview of the CIA director? This kind of jockeying, of course, does nothing to solve the real question American taxpayers want answered: Where is bin Laden? That question is likely only to be resolved by good old-fashioned espionage. Emblematic of what ails the intelligence community today was its reaction to the failed attempt by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to blow up a Northwest passenger jet landing in Detroit, Michigan, with a bomb made of plastic explosives on Christmas Day 2009. To do the job, AQAP recruited in Yemen a Nigerian graduate of the elite University College London. His name was Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. There was a great deal of subsequent hand-wringing by Obama administration officials about how improved information sharing protocols might have worked better to assemble the shards of information known to the government about Abdulmutallab, which might have prevented him from boarding the Northwest flight. Their solution: Hire more analysts. But this was to misdiagnose the problem. The intelligence community is awash in analysts. While the precise number is classified, it is reasonable to assume that there are tens of thousands. What is needed is not more analysts but better on-the-ground intelligence. If the CIA had had a spy on the fringes of AQAP, the appearance of an educated Nigerian from London in the remote desert areas of Yemen where al Qaeda members hide out would have been something that the spy would have flagged to his handlers as remarkable. There does not appear to have been such an agent. What can be done? The House and Senate Intelligence committees that oversee the intelligence community should hold the CIA to real account using a simple metric: How many jihadist groups including al Qaeda have been penetrated by its agents? This is less onerous a demand then one might imagine. After just a few months of hanging out in Pakistan, Bryant Neal Vinas, an unemployed Hispanic-American convert to militant Islam from Long Island, managed to waltz into an al Qaeda training camp where he was trained how to attack American bases in Afghanistan. And that was seven years after 9/11. Budgets should be cut if the CIA can't provide proof that it is penetrating al Qaeda and its affiliates; at the end of the day, this is the most likely way that we will ever find bin Laden, who is not going to be voluntarily given up by the few who know his location today. President Obama should appoint someone in the U.S. government whose job it is to find bin Laden and who can coordinate that effort across the 16 agencies that make up the U.S. intelligence community. Finally, the background check for spies should be reformed so that men and women with the regional expertise and linguistic abilities to penetrate and recruit inside jihadist terrorist groups are hired to go outside the wire and get the job done. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Bergen.","U.S. spends billions on an enormous intelligence bureaucracy, says Peter Bergen .

"Miami, Florida, (CNN) -- The Dalai Lama would like to retire. ""I'm also a human being. ... Retirement is also my right,"" the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet told CNN's Hala Gorani in Miami, Florida, this week. Without saying exactly when, he said, ""Sooner or later, I have to go. I'm over 75, so next 10 years, next 20 years, one day I will go."" The Dalai Lama also said he supports recent protests in Tibet, where students marched in opposition to government plans to teach university classes in Mandarin Chinese, instead of the traditional Tibetan language. ""My real boss is the Tibetan people inside Tibet. So now, whenever they carry some sort of movement, I have to support,"" he said. He added that as long as protests are nonviolent, they should be considered lawful and reasonable. He sees signs of change in Tibet and remains ""optimistic"" about the region's future, he said. Also in the interview, the Dalai Lama reiterated his support for recent Nobel Peace Prize winner, Liu Xiaobo, imprisoned in China. He said he joined a group of Nobel laureates, including South Africa's Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who have called on Chinese authorities to release Liu. The Dalai Lama said he is not bothered if world leaders do not want to meet with him so as not to anger China. ""It doesn't matter,"" he said. ""If they find it a little bit inconvenient, then of course, it's absolutely OK."" He said his main concern is meeting with the public to promote human values and religious harmony.

"(CNN) -- Three Kenyan police officers have been suspended, authorities said Friday, after photos allegedly showed them shooting three unarmed men on a busy street in central Nairobi. Kenya's largest newspaper, the Daily Nation, published the photos Thursday. It said they were taken by a motorist at the scene of the shooting in the capital. The first photo shows a man described by the paper as an undercover officer pointing a gun at two men lying face down on the highway. Another one shows the two men riddled with bullets lying in the middle of the road. A third shooting apparently took place, the paper said. A police spokesman confirmed that three men were killed, and three officers have been suspended pending an investigation. ""They (officers) are very much innocent until declared guilty, let's not forget that,"" Eric Kiraithe said by phone from Nairobi. ""We are conducting an investigation and will have the results soon."" Kiraithe said the victims have criminal records, and one injured a police officer in a shooting last week. ""That said, they have their rights as human beings, of course, so it does not justify their deaths,"" he said. The killings sparked condemnation nationwide, with human rights groups renewing calls for reform in the Kenyan police. The trio was compliant and had already surrendered, Amnesty International said in a news release. A 2009 U.N. report accused Kenyan police of misusing its power, and called for the removal of the nation's police commissioner at the time. ""Killings by the police in Kenya are systematic, widespread and carefully planned. They are committed at will and with utter impunity,"" U.N. Special Rapporteur Philip Alston said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- ""Death rays"" sound more like a sci-fi creation than a pool-side concern, but guests soaking up the sun at the Vdara Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, might want to take cover. According to a report in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the reflective hotel's south-facing tower can bounce rays that will melt plastic and singe hair at certain times of the day and year. Visiting lawyer Bill Pintas from Chicago, Illinois, had a scorching encounter and said hotel pool employees told him they call it ""the death ray,"" according to the report. Pintas, who co-owns a Vdara condo, told the Review-Journal his hair was singed as he was reclining on the pool deck around noon on a mid-September day. ""I was effectively being cooked,"" Pintas said. ""I started running as fast as I could without looking like a lunatic."" The rays also melted the thin plastic bag around his newspaper, Pintas said. Hotel designers were aware of potential solar ""convergence"" and applied a film that reduced the problem by about 70 percent before the Vdara opened in December 2009, according to MGM Resorts spokesman Alan Feldman. ""What remains are seasonal hot spots that are most acute of course in the summertime,"" Feldman said. Historic high temperatures in Las Vegas this summer have intensified the problem. Hotel staffers are aware of the hot spots and move guests around the pool deck when necessary, Feldman said. Planners are also looking at additional shading options or putting planters where the rays get particularly hot, he said. The hotel hasn't received any complaints of injury beyond those reported by Pintas. ""Death ray"" media coverage in recent weeks hasn't had any effect on bookings, Feldman said, and a 72-hour rate sale under way now is unrelated to the buzz. ""I suppose there might even be folks who are very passionate about the sun who want to come see it,"" Feldman said. ""It isn't a visible thing ... if you were standing in the middle of it when it's 110 [degrees], you're going to feel it. We happen to be in a much cooler week this week so right now, today, it might actually feel good,"" he said, laughing.","""Death ray"" phenomenon reported by Las Vegas Review-Journal .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Chinese military continues to increase spending on efforts to break into U.S. military computer systems, expand its Navy, and invest in intercontinental nuclear missiles and weapons to destroy satellites, according to the latest U.S report on China's military power. Chinese military officers after a meeting about the People's Liberation Army in 2007. The annual report from the Pentagon to Congress says China's total military spending in 2007 was between $97 billion and $139 billion, but it is hard to tell exactly how much was spent and on what. In comparison, the U.S. military budget request for 2008 is $481.4 billion, not including war requests. Pentagon officials said a chunk of China's spending went to cyberwarfare, because 2007 saw several ""intrusions"" believed to be from the Peoples Liberation Army. In the incidents, unclassified U.S. military computer systems were broken into and information was taken, according to Pentagon officials. While the information taken was not classified, Pentagon officials said the worry is the Chinese hacking required many of the skills and capabilities that would also be required for a computer network attack. Last summer, a cyber-attack on Department of Defense computer systems took down the e-mail capability of hundreds of staffers for weeks, but the Pentagon still will not comment on who initiated the attack. It is widely believed among the military to have been the Peoples Liberation Army. China is also investing heavily in and fielding improved nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles and antisatellite missiles, according to the report. The United States expressed its concern last year after China fired a missile at one of its old satellites and destroyed it, sending thousands of dangerous pieces of space debris into orbit. The United States conducted a similar strike last month on a broken U.S. spy satellite before it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere. U.S. officials said the satellite was hit and broke into thousands of small pieces that burned up as they re-entered Earth's atmosphere. The United States is also concerned about the purchase of more submarines by the Chinese navy as well as plans for more aircraft carriers. The Chinese once had a small Navy. Now the United States is keeping an eye on the growing service amid concerns over Taiwan. The concerns include ""China's near-term focus on preparing for contingencies in the Taiwan Strait, including the possibility of U.S. intervention, which is an important driver of its modernization,"" the report says. Additionally, the Chinese have placed about 100 more short-range missiles on the shore opposite Taiwan in the past year, it says. Pentagon officials worry the continued increase in Chinese military spending is slowly tipping the balance of power between China and Taiwan in China's favor. The United States has said it would help defend Taiwan if China invaded. The report also says the Peoples Liberation Army is ""pursuing comprehensive transformation from a mass army designed for protracted wars of attrition on its territory to one capable of fighting and winning short-duration, high-intensity conflicts along its periphery against high-tech adversaries."" Such an army, the report says, would have ""the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States and field disruptive military technologies that could, over time, offset traditional U.S. military advantages."" The United States says the lack of transparency by the Chinese on its spending poses ""risks to stability by increasing the potential for misunderstanding and miscalculation,"" and that China has yet to explain to the international community the purpose of its military expansion, Pentagon officials said.

"(CNN) -- A man suspected of conspiring with a terrorist network responsible for the deaths of five U.S. soldiers in Iraq was arrested Wednesday in Canada, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York. Faruq Khalil Muhammad, 38, is charged with conspiring to kill Americans abroad and providing material support to a terrorist network that conducted suicide bombings in Iraq, the statement said. He was arrested by authorities after a U.S. warrant was issued for his arrest. The five U.S. soldiers were killed on April 10, 2009, when a Tunisian man drove a truck filled with explosives to the gate of a U.S. forward operating base in Mosul, Iraq. The trucks' detonation destroyed a vehicle in a nearby U.S. convoy, killing Sgt. Gary L. Woods, 24; Sgt. 1st. Class Bryan E. Hall, 32; Sgt. Edward W. Forrest Jr., 25; Cpl. Jason G. Pautsch, 20; and Pvt. Bryce E. Gaultier, 22, the statement said. Muhammed is suspected of providing material support for that attack and allegedly sought to conduct attacks himself and become a suicide bomber, the statement said. ""There is no safe harbor for terrorists, including those who endeavor to spread violence from halfway across the world,"" said U.S. Attorney Loretta E. Lynch in the statement. ""Today's arrest demonstrates that we have not forgotten that sacrifice (of U.S. soldiers) and will continue to use every available means to bring to justice all those who are responsible."" It was not immediately clear whether Muhammed had obtained legal representation. The Justice Department said it would seek to have Muhammed extradited to the United States for trial. If convicted, Muhammed faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, the statement said.","Faruq Khalil Muhammad was arrested in Canada .

The incident took place as one of the 18 presidential candidates was denouncing the outgoing president and his endorsed candidate in a news conference broadcast live on Haitian radio. ""I have a message for [Rene] Preval and his acolyte,"" said Michel ""Sweet Mickey"" Martelly. ""Haiti doesn't want you any more."" As he spoke, hundreds of people, chanting Martelly's name, jogged toward the center of Port-au-Prince until they were intercepted by riot police. The tide turned when police fired several canisters of tear gas into the crowd, sending Martelly's supporters sprinting for cover. On Sunday, hours before the polls closed, Martelly and 11 other candidates for president made a joint declaration denouncing the election and calling for its cancellation. The candidates accused Preval of organizing widespread fraud in favor of his Unity Party, which is fronted by establishment candidate Jude Celestin. The dissenting candidates did not offer evidence to back up their claims. Senior officials from Haiti's election organizing committee, the Conseil Electoral Provisoire, defended the vote and calling it a success. ""The election day has successfully concluded,"" said the committee's director general, Pierre Opont, in a news conference Sunday night. Opont said there had been incidents at 56 polling centers out of a total of 1,500 across the country, less than 4 percent. He also said at least one person died as a result of election violence. However, there were widespread reports Sunday of disorganization and some cases of apparent cheating at the polls. ""We had observers in about 50 polling stations, and in each one we interviewed countless individuals who could not vote at that polling station because their names weren't on the electoral lists,"" said Nicole Phillips, staff attorney with the non-profit organization Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti. ""If we go ahead and certify the elections,"" Phillips said, referring to international donors that have helped fund the vote, ""then we look bad. We paid for these elections. We organized them. We trained the people. And the fact that it was horrible yesterday looks bad on us."" On Sunday, the United Nations issued a written statement expressing ""deep concern at the numerous incidents that marred the elections."" A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince said American diplomats were appealing for calm and waiting for the result of a report expected to be issued by a team of international election observers in a joint delegation from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community. Ambassador Colin Granderson, head of the monitoring delegation, Monday listed a large number of irregularities and problems with the election. However, he said, ""the joint mission does not believe that these irregularities, serious as some of them were, necessarily invalidate the process."" He called the decision of the 12 presidential candidates to call for cancellation of elections hours before polls closed ""precipitous"" and ""regrettable."" He said the vote-counting process should continue, and made a fresh appeal for calm among all parties. In addition to the presidential election, seats also were being contested in the Senate and in the lower house of parliament. Nearly all of the candidates campaigned on similar platforms -- fighting corruption, creating jobs, and addressing a series of natural disasters that has left the Caribbean nation reeling and prompted many to urge for a postponement of Sunday's vote. According to electoral law, a candidate must win 50 percent of the vote or the election goes to a second-round runoff. Haiti's growing political crisis comes as it struggles to cope with a deadly cholera epidemic that has killed more than 1,600 people since last month. On Monday, the turmoil appeared to be spilling over the border. A United Nations Police spokesman confirmed reports of a clash erupting on Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic between soldiers of that nation and Haitian civilians. ""Shots were fired,"" said spokesman Jean-Francois Vezina. ""Our UNPOL people are there and trying to intervene."" Vezina said he could not confirm reports broadcast on Haitian radio that a woman and a girl were killed in the border clash.","Riot police fire tear gas at demonstrators after Haitian candidate's speech .

"(CNN) -- Werder Bremen snatched top spot in the German Bundesliga after crushing Freiburg 6-0 on Saturday, as young playmaker Mesut Ozil stole the show. The 21-year-old Germany international set up four goals and scored one himself as the home side moved ahead of previous leaders Bayer Leverkusen on goal difference, with both teams on 26 points. Unbeaten Leverkusen can regain their lead in Sunday's trip to ailing former champions Bayern Munich, while Hamburg can move up to 26 points with victory at home to Bochum. But Bremen ensured bragging rights for at least 24 hours with a demolition job that left Freiburg just two points above the bottom three. Daniel Jansen and Ozil both hit the woodwork before the latter crossed for striker Hugo Almeida to head home the 33rd-minute opener. Marko Marin doubled the lead 10 minutes after halftime with a freekick, then Ozil teed up Almeida's second soon after before making it 4-0 on 67 as he collected a long ball and rounded goalkeeper Simon Pouplin. Ozil was fouled in the box by Mohamadou Idrissou to allow Naldo to score from the spot six minutes later, and his cross from the left was converted by Markus Rosenberg on 82. Schalke moved up to third place with a 2-0 win at home to Hannover, who were mourning the suicide of Germany goalkeeper Robert Enke. There was a minute's silence before the game to commemorating his death, but it was Schalke who took the lead in the 69th minute as Jefferson Farfan headed home Rafinha's corner. Jan Moravek sealed victory in the second minute of time added on after Enke's deputy Florian Fromlowitz blocked a shot by Lukas Schmitz, meaning Schalke ended a three-game winless run -- and extended their unbeaten run to seven -- to move onto 25 points. Defending champions Wolfsburg lost 3-2 at home to Nuremberg, who moved out of the bottom three thanks to Peer Kluge's last-gasp winner three minutes into stoppage time. Ten-man Stuttgart had to come from behind to earn a 1-1 draw at home to bottom club Hertha Berlin, as Zdravko Kuzmanovic's 82nd-minute effort canceled out the 49th-minute opener by Adrian Ramos. However, the Serbian was sent off three minutes later for a second booking, but struggling Stuttgart held on. Hoffenheim crushed Cologne 4-0 to move above Hamburg on goal difference, while Borussia Monchengladbach moved away from the relegation zone with a 2-1 victory at Eintracht Frankfurt. Borussia Dortmund hosted Mainz in the late match.","Werder Bremen snatch top spot in Bundesliga on goal difference after crushing Freiburg 6-0 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- For Europe's biggest leagues the football season has ended, the boring business of kicking a ball about is over, and now the real fun can begin as the transfer window opens. Cristiano Ronaldo has left Manchester United to join Real Madrid for a world record fee of $130 million. What is the transfer window? The transfer window is a set period of time when football clubs are allowed to buy new players. Although players can't be bought outside the transfer window it doesn't stop clubs negotiating transfers before the window opens, with players signing on the dotted line once it does. There are two transfer windows per year, one pre-season, and one mid- season, which is open throughout January. The English Premier League pre-season transfer window opened at midnight on the last day of the season (May 24) and will close on August 31, while in the other big European football nations (including France, Germany Italy and Spain) the transfer window opens on July 1 and closes at the end of August. Other countries operate pre-season transfer windows to fit the calendar of their own football seasons. See our choice of the top 20 transfer targets Â». Why does it matter? The transfer window can see some of football's biggest stars switch club and it is a period that can determine how a team will fare during the season ahead. It is a chance for coaches to rebuild and reinforce their squads, and a time when clubs can see their key players depart for greener pastures and bigger wage packets. When a club is active in the transfer window, making big name buys, it can be taken as a statement of intent for the following season. Just watch Spanish club Real Madrid bring in star players in an attempt to make up the distance between them and arch-rivals Barcelona. The global economic downturn means many clubs may not spend as much money this summer as they have in recent years, or that they may be more willing to trade or part exchange players if they are unable to meet a player's price tag. The final day of the transfer window, known as deadline day, often brings a frenzy of activity as teams try to finalize deals before the window slams shut, drawing the curtains until January 1, when the transfer fun begins again. Keep up with the latest transfer gossip with our transfer blog. Movers and shakers . This summer's transfer window is likely to be dominated by one club -- Real Madrid. Their newly elected club president, billionaire construction magnate Florentino Perez, previously headed the club between 2000 and 2006, when his policy was to bring football's biggest names to Real Madrid. The ""Galacticos"" brought to Real by Perez included the likes of LuÃ­s Figo, Zinedine Zidane, the Brazilian Ronaldo and David Beckham. Now Perez is back in charge and seems intent on reviving his ""Galacticos"" policy, rsigning former World Player of the Year Kaka before smashing the world transfer record to spay $130 million for Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo. Madrid have also been linked with Bayern Munich's French winger Frank Ribery, Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso and Valencia winger David Silva . But Real won't have it all their own way, facing competition from the likes of Chelsea. New manager Carlo Ancelotti is bound to have brought a shopping list with him and the club's Russian billionaire owner Roman Abramovich will want to show that he still has the financial muscle to compete on the transfer money-go-round. Then there is Manchester City, funded by the vast oil wealth of the Abu Dhabi United Group. The owners have so far struggled to attract big names to the club and will be keen to show that City are genuine Champions League material. At the other end of the spectrum Spanish club Valencia are in all kinds of financial difficulty and may be forced to sell their biggest assets, with David Silva and striker David Villa the most prized of all.","The transfer window is the only time football teams can buy new players .

"(CNN)  -- Maria Sharapova put memories of her first round defeat at last year's Australian Open firmly behind her with a convincing opening victory over Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand. Former champion Sharapova was shocked by fellow Russian Maria Kirilenko in 2010 as she struggled to find her best form after shoulder surgery, but all that was forgotten with a 6-1 6-3 victory at Melbourne Park on Monday. Given the first slot again on the showpiece Rod Laver Arena, Sharapova dropped the first game to love after serving two double faults and admitted thoughts of her loss last year were at the back of her mind. ""I was definitely a little bit nervous in the first game,"" Sharapova told the official Australian Open website. ""Last year I played first match on center and lost. I really didn't want that to happen again. In the middle of the first set, I started swinging a little bit."" Should the Australian Open be played in February? The 14th seed then reeled off the next six games to take the opener in just 25 minutes. Sharapova trailed 3-1 in the second set before a run of five straight wins enabled her to close out a comfortable win. Top seed Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark also came through a tough-looking opener against Argentina's Gisela Dulko, the world number one in doubles. Wozniacki won 6-3 6-4 in one hour 40 minutes, putting an early defeat at last week's WTA tournament in Sydney behind her as she bids for her first grand slam title. Australian Open: From nomad to nouveau riche . With defending champion Serena Williams absent through injury, her sister Venus Williams is hoping to keep the title in the family and the fourth seed made a convincing start, beating Italian Sara Errani 6-3 6-2 in their first round match. French Open champion Francesca Schiavone dropped the first set to Spain's Arantxa Para Santonja before winning 6-7 6-2 6-4. Last week's winner in Sydney, China's Li Na, continued her fine form with a 6-1 7-5 win over Swede Sofia Arvidsson to advance. Former world number one Justine Henin, playing her first WTA tour match since losing to fellow Belgian Kim Clijsters in the last 16 at Wimbledon last year, came through a tough test against India's Sania Mirza. Henin won 5-7 6-3 6-1 to set up a second-round clash with Britain's Elena Baltacha. Henin, who has been sidelined with an elbow injury told the official website:  ""I think I need this kind of match to really get into the tournament like I want to be and at my best level.""

"(CNN) -- Frank Lampard missed a late penalty as Chelsea's English Premier League lead was cut to two points following a 2-1 defeat at Manchester City on Saturday evening. Big-spending City ended a record run of seven successive draws to hand the Londoners a third league defeat this season and allow rivals Manchester United to gain ground. United romped to a 4-0 victory at lowly West Ham, but suffered more defensive problems as England internationals Gary Neville and Wes Brown joined an already lengthy injury list. It capped a miserable week for Chelsea, who were knocked out of the League Cup by Blackburn in a penalty shootout on Wednesday. Carlo Ancelotti's team made the perfect start when City striker Emmanuel Adebayor inadvertently put the ball in his own net in the eighth minute after goalkeeper Shay Given's save from a Nicolas Anelka shot hit him in the back and rebounded in. Adebayor made up for that misfortune eight minutes before halftime when he fired home at the second attempt when the ball fell to him after Shaun Wright-Phillips' shot hit teammate Micah Richards, leaving Chelsea to appeal in vain for handball. Argentina forward Carlos Tevez put the home side ahead in the 56th minute when he curled in a free-kick after being fouled by Ricardo Carvalho. City lost England defenders Richards and Bridge to injury -- the latter stretchered off after a studs-first lunge by Juliano Bennetti -- before substitute fullback Nedum Onuoha gave Chelsea the chance to level in the 82nd minute when he brought down Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba. However, Given turned away England midfielder Lampard's poor spot-kick, and the visitors were unable to rally again as captain John Terry went off with a knee injury. The England center-back is likely to miss Wednesday's Champions League tie with Apoel Nicosia, but should be fit to face Everon next weekend. Manchester United, on the other hand, had no such worries as they continued the form that saw them brush aside Tottenham in the quarterfinals of the League Cup on Tuesday. Veteran midfielder Paul Scholes, who has been reportedly pondering his future, lashed home his 99th Premier League goal on the stroke of halftime and then his potential young successor Darren Gibson followed up his midweek double with a similarly impressive strike in the 61st minute. Brazilian midfielder Anderson crossed for Antonio Valencia to score the third from close range 10 minutes later, and the Ecuador winger set up England striker Wayne Rooney just 60 seconds after that. United boss Alex Ferguson had been forced to pair England midfielder Michael Carrick with left-back Patrice Evra in the center of defense after Neville and Brown went off injured. Rio Ferdinand and Jonny Evans are ruled out, but Ferguson hopes Serbian center-back Nemanja Vidic will recover from illness for Wednesday's Champions League trip to Wolfsburg, with United needing a point to finish top of Group B. The defeat left Gianfranco Zola's struggling West Ham side just a point above the relegation zone. Injury-hit Arsenal moved into third place above London rivals Tottenham, who travel to Everton on Sunday. Arsene Wenger's team bounced back from successive 3-0 defeats by Chelsea and Manchester City, the latter in the League Cup quarterfinals in midweek, to win 2-0 at home to mid-table Stoke. Spain midfielder Cesc Fabregas missed a penalty on his 250th appearance for the Gunners after Andriy Arshavin was tripped, but the Russia forward -- playing on his own up front in the absence of Theo Walcott, Robin van Persie, Nicklas Bendtner and Eduardo -- scored the opener from a tight angle in the 26th minute. Arshavin had a shot deflected onto the crossbar before substitute midfielder Aaron Ramsey sealed victory with 11 minutes left, cutting into the box and sliding a shot past goalkeeper Thomas Sorensen. Fifth-placed Aston Villa moved level with Tottenham on 26 points after winning 3-0 at home to Hull, who lost influential midfielder Jimmy Bullard to yet another knee injury. England midfielder James Milner set up Republic of Ireland defender Richard Dunne for Villa's 13th-minute opener, then lobbed an exquisite goal from 20 yards after goalkeeper Matt Duke was caught stranded outside his area. Substitute striker John Carew added a third from the penalty spot two minutes from time after Duke was booked for bringing down Ashley Young as Villa followed up the midweek win over Portsmouth that put Martin O'Neill's side in the semifinals of the League Cup. Last year's runners-up Liverpool continue to struggle after being held 0-0 away to 12th-placed Blackburn and were leapfrogged in the table by Manchester City. Birmingham City moved up to eighth place after winning 3-2 at Wigan Athletic, with Alex McLeish's side coming from a goal down to score three in 11 second-half minutes as Sebastian Larsson scored with two free-kicks and Colombia striker Christian Benitez netted the other. Wigan, who led through a superb strike from Charles N'Zogbia, pulled one back at the end through Jordi Gomez but the defeat left Robert Martinez's frustratingly inconsistent side in 14th place -- four points above the drop zone. Avram Grant celebrated his first victory as manager of bottom club Portsmouth with a 2-0 victory at home to Burnley, as striker Aruna Dindane made up for a first-half penalty miss by adding the second goal following defender Hermann Hreidarsson's 65th-minute opener. Wolverhampton remained in the relegation zone despite ending a three-game losing streak by triumphing 2-1 against visiting Bolton, who dropped to second from bottom.","Frank Lampard misses a late penalty as Chelsea lose 2-1 at Manchester City .

"(CNN)  -- Defender turned striker Daniel van Buyten scored an 88th minute winner for Bayern Munich to give them a much-needed 2-1 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt to revive their Bundesliga title challenge. The Belgian was pushed up front by coach Louis van Gaal after Italian striker Luca Toni was substituted and he came up trumps with a late header. It made amends for his sending off in the 2-1 Champions League defeat to Bordeaux in midweek. The win also takes the Bavarian giants to fifth place in the German standings with 18 points after 10 games, four points adrift of Bayer Leverkusen, who were held 1-1 by Borussia Dortmund on Friday night. Alexander Meier put the visitors in front on the hour mark at the Allianz Arena, but Dutch ace Arjen Robben, returning to first team action after injury, equalized 10 minutes later after Mario Gomez won an aerial battle to set him up to slot home. Bayern coach van Gaal was relieved to claim the three points after their midweek setback in Europe. ""We created several good chances against opponents who were very defensively minded,"" he told reporters. Hoffenheim ended a two-goal losing run with a 3-0 home win over Nuremberg to move up to sixth in the standings, a point behind Bayern. Christian Eichner with a 30-meter blast and prolific striker Vedad Ibisevic scored within four minutes in the first half to put Ralf Rangnick's side on the way to three points. Argentina's Franco Zuculini completed the scoring just after the hour mark with a fierce shot. Elsewhere, Mainz thrashed fellow promoted side Freiburg 3-0 with captain Tim Hoogland scoring twice in the second half as they moved up to seventh. A solitary goal by Didier Konan was enough to lead Hannover 96 to victory over Stuttgart , the goal coming after 31 minutes while  Borussia Moenchengladbach snapped a five-game losing streak in a goalless draw against Cologne.","Daniel van Buyten rescues Bayern with late winner at Allianz Arena .

"(CNN)  -- More than 1 billion people all over the globe will observe the 40th anniversary of Earth Day today, which promises to be the largest since that first event in 1970. In 2010, the environmental challenges we face are global and call for new solutions. Forty years ago we were reactive. In 1969, the year before the first Earth Day, two environmental disasters grabbed the country's attention: a massive oil spill coated the coast of Santa Barbara, California, and the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio, grew so polluted that it actually caught fire. Forty years later, with climate change looming and no strong international agreement in place despite the Copenhagen Climate conference, environmental activists are taking a proactive stance. They are arming themselves with the internet and social media to create another grass-roots movement for change, even larger than the first. How countries like India and China solve their future energy needs has an impact on people everywhere -- many developing countries are now pulling ahead of the United States on renewable energy -- and how the United States addresses its key issues will have an equal impact. Americans of all political stripes can agree on certain essential goals, such as how we must preserve the world's natural wonders for generations to come and how we must live in harmony with this world of finite natural resources. But not everyone sees the bigger picture -- that the global economy will improve by moving away from dependence on fossil fuel, that investments in renewable energy can create jobs and that a new revolution is needed to replace the outdated Industrial Revolution. It took 150 years to transform our agrarian society to an industrial one. But today, we don't have the luxury of time. Climate solutions are urgently needed. The challenge is to move from carbon-based energy and industrial systems into a post-carbon, or green, economy. A green economy relies on renewable energy and the creation of green jobs to prevent further pollution and resource depletion and sustain economic growth. Economic growth, quality jobs and energy independence are not mutually exclusive. According to studies gathered by the Environmental and Energy Study Group, a Washington energy think tank, energy efficiency employs 8 million and renewable energy employs 450,000 in the United States. The Earth Day Network and its partners are orchestrating large events in New York; Rabat, Morocco; Kolkata, India; Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Tokyo, Japan.  A massive climate rally is planned for Washington on April 25. Earth Day Network is backed by more than 20,000 organizations spanning 190 countries. All these organizations have a stake in climate change, development and growth, national security and energy policy -- geopolitical issues that must be addressed. Earth Day has become a  year-round imperative.  From public meetings to civic action, Earth Day's influence has created a green generation of activists, business leaders, and government leaders who are creating a new global green future worthy of the aspirations of the first Earth Day. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathleen Rogers.","Kathleen Rogers: More than a billion people to take part in the 40th Earth Day .

"(CNN) -- English Premier League side Everton are pondering proposing a ground share with city rivals Liverpool following the rejection of plans for their own 50,000 stadium. Everton had proposed the new $660 million combined stadium and shopping complex for Kirkby, located north-east of the city, but were rejected by the local council. Chief executive Robert Elstone admits the club could be interested in teaming up with their city neighbours at Stanley Park, the planned location for Liverpool's new 61,000 stadium. ""We are going to look forward and look forward positively,"" Elston told the British Press Association. ""A shared stadium is perhaps an option if it's affordable."" Everton are keen to take advantage of the increased revenue a bigger stadium would bring over their current 40,000-capacity Goodison Park ground. With their Kirkby proposal, which was to be co-funded by British supermarket chain Tesco, looking unlikely to get the go-ahead a ground share with Liverpool would seem an obvious solution especially with the Reds struggling to raise the necessary money to get the development going. ""We have to look at where we can raise money, because potentially Liverpool will have to obviously contribute to that, and Liverpool City Council perhaps might need to find some money,"" added Elston. ""We're going to have to start to have those conversations; we're not going to have to be open-minded about solutions."" Liverpool's American owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett however have previously said they were opposed to such plans as they did not want to lose out on the revenue streams which come from sole ownership.

The rejection of the Kirkby stadium proposal is a major blow to Everton's future plans with the club hoping the development would have encouraged much needed investment.

"(CNN) -- Arjen Robben scored twice on his debut as Bayern Munich gave new coach Louis Van Gaal his first victory with a 3-0 crushing of German Bundesliga champions Wolfsburg on Saturday. Two-goal Arjen Robben made an immediate impact following his transfer from Real Madrid. The Dutch winger netted both goals in the second half to add to Mario Gomez's first-half opener at the Allianz Arena. The victory left Bayern five points behind new leaders Bayer Leverkusen, who went three points clear after four games with a 2-1 victory at home to Bochum earlier on Saturday. Visiting Wolfsburg crashed to a second successive defeat, having lost 4-2 to Hamburg last weekend. Armin Veh's team went behind in the 27th minute when Germany striker Gomez pounced for his second goal of the season after Diego Benaglio could only parry Hamit Altintop's long-range shot. Van Gaal brought on Robben, signed during the week from Spanish big-spenders Real Madrid, at the start of the second half. His first goal was set up by fellow substitute Franck Ribery in the 69th minute, with the Dutchman's shot taking a slight deflection off Andrea Barzagli. Wolfsburg striker Edin Dzeko hit the post in the 72nd minute and his fellow frontman Grafite had an effort cleared off the line by Philipp Lahm soon after. But Robben settled Bayern's nerves in the 81st minute from a counter-attack, with France star Ribery again involved. Leverkusen trailed Bochum in the 32nd minute when Manuel Friedrich put the ball into his own net, deflecting Joel Epalle's shot past goalkeeper Rene Adler. But the defender made amends four minutes before halftime when he headed home Michael Kadlec's long free-kick to equalize. Stefan Kiessling fired the winner with just over 20 minutes remaining with a right-foot effort from a cross by Toni Kross for his fourth goal of the season. In Saturday's other games, Freiburg ended Schalke's unbeaten run as Cha Du-Ri's goal five minutes before halftime gave the visitors their first win since returning to the top flight. Hoffenheim also claimed a first victory of the league season, winning 1-0 at Hannover thanks to Carlos Eduardo's first-half strike. Eintracht Frankfurt drew 1-1 at home to Borussia Dortmund, with Ioannis Amanatidis canceling out Mohamed Zidan's opener for the visitors. Nurnberg moved a point above bottom club Cologne -- who face Hamburg on Sunday -- after a 0-0 draw at Stuttgart.","Arjen Robben scores twice on his debut as Bayern Munich notch first victory .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Having won 24 trophies in 23 seasons, Alex Ferguson has established himself as the most successful manager in British football history. Sir Alex Ferguson: English football's most successful manager with 24 titles . But the 67-year-old Manchester United manager, who has brought 10 league titles to the Red Devils in his time there, established his name in football long before he moved to the Old Trafford club in 1986. Born Alexander Chapman Ferguson  in Glasgow on New Year's Eve 1941, Ferguson started his playing career as an amateur at Scottish side Queen's Park when he was just 16, while working as an apprentice tool-worker at the local shipyards. His first move as a player was to St Johnstone, where he secured his big break. Ferguson scored a hat-trick in an unlikely win against top side Rangers and in the summer of 1964 Dunfermline Athletic offered him his first professional contract. Ferguson went on to score 66 goals for Dunfermline before a move to Rangers. In 1969 he was blamed for a goal through which Rangers lost the Scottish Cup Final. He eventually left and ended his playing career with stints at Falkirk and Ayr United. At just 32, Ferguson secured his first coaching contract with East Stirlingshire. He managed to bring an improvement in the team's results and soon moved to St. Mirren -- where he would enjoy his first major success. Ferguson brought the struggling second division team into the top flight, where they claimed the first division title in 1977. Aberdeen was the next challenge for Ferguson -- and it was here that he established himself as a world-class manager. See top moments from Ferguson's management career Â» . In 1980 he claimed the Scottish league crown with Aberdeen -- the first time in 15 years it had not been won by Rangers or Celtic. Success continued, and in the 1982-83 season he remarkably took Aberdeen to European Cup Winners' Cup glory, beating Spanish giants Real Madrid 2-1 in the final. Ferguson joined Manchester United in 1986 where, in his 23 years at the club, he has won the Premier League 10 times, the FA Cup five times, the European Champions League twice and the FIFA Club World Cup once. Despite some low points -- particularly in late 1989, when many believed he might be sacked after a terrible start to the season  -- Ferguson has managed a team which has enjoyed consistent success through a period of rapid change in football. He has also nurtured players like David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo, bringing them to the top of their game. His success has not gone unnoticed off the field either. He has won the World Soccer Magazine World Manager of the Year accolade on four occasions and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 1999, following his induction as both an Officer and Commander of the Order of the British Empire. On a personal note, he has been married to wife Cathy since 1966 and they have three sons. Darren is the current manager of English third-tier club Peterborough. At 67, it is not certain how much longer Alex Ferguson has left in the game and has hinted in recent years that he might step down. But, as he steers his team towards potentially another Premier League title this season, there is no doubting how he will be remembered: one of the greatest football managers ever.","Alex Ferguson is the most successful manager in English football .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- U.S. authorities have ratcheted up pressure on one of Mexico's most notorious drug cartels, releasing new details about the so-called Gulf Cartel's operations and offering up to a $50 million reward for the arrest of its leaders. These are weapons that the Mexican army said it seized from the ruthless Gulf Cartel in 2008. A federal indictment unsealed Monday charged Miguel Trevino Morales, a leader of the northern Mexico-based Gulf Cartel, of operating a criminal enterprise, cocaine distribution and firearms violations. Concurrently, prosecutors updated a separate indictment against three other top leaders of the Gulf Cartel: Antonio Cardenas Guillen, Jorge Eduardo Costilla and Heriberto Lazcano, for drug trafficking related crimes, all believed to be at large in Mexico. Fifteen other suspected cartel members are also named in that indictment. ""We have learned that the most effective way to disrupt and dismantle criminal organizations is to prosecute their leaders and seize their funding,"" Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer said in a statement. To that end, the departments of justice, state and treasury are working together to place pressure on the Gulf Cartel and what authorities describe as its ruthless enforcement arm, known as Los Zetas. The Department of the Treasury designated the four top bosses named in the indictments as Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers, which authorizes the freezing of any assets they hold in the United States and other sanctions. The Gulf Cartel and Zetas, nicknamed collectively as ""The Company,"" are among the major drug cartels that are behind the drug-related violence that has swept Mexico in recent years, according to authorities. Since taking office in 2006, Mexican President Felipe Calderon has made fighting the cartels a major priority. The group also operates in cities across the United States, authorities said. The court documents detail telephone conversations between the four leaders and more than a dozen other cartel members allegedly discussing the transportation and smuggling of cocaine and marijuana into the United States. ""These indictments allege a stunning and sophisticated operation by 'The Company' to move illegal drugs into our communities and cash back to Mexico,"" Breuer said. The State Department is offering a rewards totaling up to $50 million for information leading to the capture of four top leaders and six other cartel lieutenants.","U.S. authorities ratchet up the pressure on Mexico's notorious Gulf Cartel .

"(CNN) -- Italian teenager Federico Macheda enjoyed a remarkable debut to English football as he curled home an injury-time winner that sent Manchester United back to the top of the Premier League with a thrilling 3-2 home win over Aston Villa. Macheda receives a hug from manager Sir Alex Ferguson after scoring Manchester United's last-gasp winner. It seemed United would have to settle for a point after Cristiano Ronaldo's double had only proved enough to keep United level against a Villa side that thoroughly deserved a lead provided by John Carew and Gabriel Agbonlahor. But 17-year-old substitute Macheda, a former member of the Lazio academy who arrived at Old Trafford in 2007, was to have the last word. Who is Federico Macheda? At exactly the same moment as Yossi Benayoun struck for Liverpool at Fulham on Saturday, Macheda turned onto Ryan Giggs' low pass before unleashing a stunning shot that curled past Brad Friedel and sent Old Trafford into ecstasy. United, missing a host of players including Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes, started poorly against an out-of-form Villa side who had gone eight matches without victory. However, a stunning piece of skill from Cristiano Ronaldo gave them a 14th- minute lead. James Milner and Friedel got themselves into a muddle, forcing the Villa keeper to handle a back pass. The resulting free-kick saw Ryan Giggs brush the ball to Ronaldo, who sent a fierce shot over the wall and into the roof of Friedel's net in a flash. Villa were not to be denied and they drew level when Gareth Barry wriggled his way into space by the touchline and Carew crept between Gary Neville and John O'Shea to steer a deft header into the bottom corner of the net. The visitors then took a deserved lead on the hour mark when Ronaldo gifted possession to Stiliyan Petrov, who swept upfield unopposed. He found Carew, whose perfect cross was headed home by Agbonlahor. The goal stung United into life and they levelled with 13 minutes remaining when Michael Carrick exchanged first-time passes with Giggs on the edge of the Villa box, before presenting Ronaldo with a lay-off. The world player of the year did not have a lot to aim at but he found the one small gap Friedel was unable to cover. A draw would have been a fair result, but United poured forward and in the third minute of five added on minutes at the end of the match, Macheda delivered the killer blow to leave the defending champions a point clear of Liverpool at the top with a game in hand. Meanwhile, in the day's other match, Everton moved to within one point of Villa in sixth position after a comfortable 4-0 victory over Wigan, courtesy of a double from on-loan Manchester City striker Jo.","Federico Macheda scores an injury-time winner as Manchester defeat Villa 3-2 .

"(CNN) -- David Beckham has confirmed that he is almost certain to return to Italian club AC Milan on loan when the transfer window re-opens in January. David Beckham has helped LA Galaxy reach the MLS playoffs for the first time since 2005. The Los Angeles Galaxy star, who earned his 115th international cap for England in Wednesday night's World Cup qualifier against Belarus, had a successful spell at the Serie A club in the second half of last season. ""The Milan deal is almost done, and hopefully that will be sorted out in the next month and I'll probably be going there at the end of December,"" the 34-year-old told reporters after being named man of the match for his 30-minute cameo appearance in the 3-0 Wembley victory. ""The move to Milan is close. I've always said I want to go back there and Milan have said they've wanted me from the time I left there. ""They are still saying the same now. It is 95 percent done and dusted, so I don't see why it is not going to happen now."" Beckham has been told by England coach Fabio Capello that he must be playing in a competitive European league is he is going to have a chance of playing at his fourth World Cup finals. ""Am I on target for a World Cup spot? There is a long time to go, a lot of games to play, a lot of the season left,"" the midfielder said. ""We will see. I'll carry on working hard, playing as hard as I can, and just to give myself a chance. ""If I'm in the squad, then great, and if not, then we've got a strong squad of players that can go to Africa and make it interesting. We all have to prove ourselves every game and every training session that we want to be in the squad and in the team for every game, and not just the World Cup,"" Beckham added. England had already qualified for South Africa before the final two qualifiers, and Beckham was an unused substitute in Saturday's 1-0 defeat in the Ukraine. He was brought on against Belarus with England 1-0 ahead and immediately brought cohesion to an experimental lineup as his first touch -- an unexpected short corner -- gave Shaun Wright-Phillips room to fire in the second goal. Beckham also hit the post late in the match as he was denied his first goal at England's national stadium, after striker Peter Crouch had wrapped up the win with his second of the match and 18th in 35 matches. Beckham's move to Milan in January was unpopular with the Galaxy's fans and his teammates, but he seems to have won them over in recent weeks after helping the club reach the Major League Soccer playoffs for the first time since 2005. On Sunday, LA travel to Houston to take on the Dynamos, who are tied with the Galaxy on 44 points at the top of the Western Conference along with Chivas USA, with two matches of the regular season still to play.","David Beckham confirms he is almost certain to return to Italian club AC Milan .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- He is hailed as a god in his native Argentina, has been a vital part of the country's culture since the mid-70s and is largely considered to be one of the greatest footballers of all time. Maradona's crowning achievement was captaining Argentina to World Cup glory in 1986. Now, 11 years since retiring from playing, Diego Maradona is making a triumphant return to the sport as the Argentine national coach. However, his checkered past has made Maradona something of a surprise choice. The 48-year-old has regularly courted controversy -- not with-standing his well-publicized drug-addiction. His talent has never been in doubt, though, and his performances on a domestic and world stage are the stuff of legend. Since beginning his career as a 15-year-old with Argentinos Juniors, Maradona has attracted legions of fans. At club level, Maradona won the Argentine title with Boca Juniors, prompting a high-profile move to European football, where he won the Copa del Rey with Barcelona. But it was at Napoli that his presence was really felt. When he arrived, the club were not considered title contenders in Serie A, but with Maradona's arrival, the southern side were transformed into one of Italian football's dominant forces. During his time with Napoli, the club won the Scudetto twice, the Coppa Italia and the UEFA Cup. And his status as a national hero was further cemented during his performances in the 1982, 1986 and 1990 World Cups. Though he briefly shone in his World Cup debut in 1982, before an act of petulance saw him sent off against Brazil, it was the 1986 tournament in Mexico that Maradona made his own. Maradona took the finals by the scruff of the neck, scoring five times, including one of the greatest goals ever scored in the 2-1 quarterfinal win over England -- as well as creating more controversy with his infamous ""hand of God"" goal in the same match. But his iconic status as a footballer is only outshone by his wild private life. His time at Napoli came to an abrupt end after he was found in possession of cocaine, and his last World Cup as a player, USA 1994, was beset with controversy, as he was sent home early after failing a drugs test. And the Maradona soap opera has continued after his retirement. Since quitting in 1997, he has spent a great deal of time in drug rehabilitation clinics in Cuba and Switzerland, where he combated his addiction to cocaine. He has also been subject to dramatic weight gain, struggling with obesity and eventually undergoing gastric bypass surgery to prevent any further fluctuations in his size. In recent years he has also been treated for the affects of alcohol abuse and his health has been a cause for much concern among the world's sports media. He has been hit by hepatitis at least twice and in 2004 he was rushed to hospital after a heart attack, following a cocaine overdose. And at times he has even seemed mentally unstable -- in a famous incident the one time chat show fired a gun at media waiting outside his house, hitting and injuring four. But, despite the negative stories that have circulated about Maradona, he is still regarded as a national hero in Argentina. No-one can doubt his skills as a player, but it has certainly raised a few eyebrows that he has been put in charge of an Argentina team that is struggling to hold its own in the World Cup qualifiers. Whether he can strategize like a professional manager is yet to be seen, but simply by being Maradona, he will prove to be a great figurehead for the team.","Diego Maradona is a football legend in Argentina, one of the world's greats .
His skills at Napoli and for the Argentina national side are highly praised .
He has a reputation for leading a wild private life, was addicted to cocaine ."
"(CNN) -- Spanish Primera Liga big-spenders Real Madrid have pruned their squad after their summer transfer splurge by completing the sales of Dutchmen Arjen Robben to Bayern Munich and Wesley Sneijder to Inter Milan. Arjen Robben (left) meets his new coach Louis van Gaal after completing his move to Bayern Munich. Robben, 25, has moved to the Bundesliga for an undisclosed fee on a four-year contract, while Sneijder has joined the Italian Serie A champions also on a four-year contract for a reported 15 million euros ($22m). Both players will wear the number 10 jerseys for their new clubs. Robben could make his debut in Saturday's mouth-watering clash with German champions Wolfsburg, with Bayern coach Louis van Gaal telling the club's official Web site: ""I am very happy to have another creative player. Arjen is a very explosive player."" Robben said Bayern had ""given me a good feeling"" from the moment they first signalled their interest in signing him. ""I feel very welcome here,"" he told the club's Web site. ""This is a big club with a great history and I am delighted to be here now."" Robben's chances of being a regular in Real's star-studded side appeared to have reduced when Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka were both signed this summer, but the former Chelsea winger still seemed keen to stay at the Bernabeu. That was until Bayern firmed up their interest and offered him the opportunity to play on a more regular basis. ""Everything went so quickly,"" he revealed. ""There were a few things that I had to consider and in the end I decided that I would like to transfer to a big club like FC Bayern."" While, Bayern were parading their new signing, Sneijder, also 25, was being introduced to the Italian media after finalizing his move . Sneijder joined Madrid in 2007 after five years with Ajax, and in his first season in Spain helped his new club win the Primera Division title. The two Dutchmen are the latest in a long line of players to leave Madrid this summer in the wake of the club's phenomenal spending spree that has seen them splash out over 250 million euros ($357m) on players such as Ronaldo, Kaka, Karim Benzema and Xavi Alonso. Aside from Sneijder and Robben, fellow-Dutchman Klaas Jan Huntelaar has been sold to AC Milan, Alvaro Negredo has joined Sevilla, while the likes of Javier Saviola, Michel Salgado, Gabriel Heinze, Fabio Cannavaro and Javi Garcia have also bid farewell to Madrid this summer. Meanwhile, it has been another busy day of transfer activity in the English Premier League with plenty of deals going through. Everton have completed the signing of Portsmouth defender Sylvain Distin on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee. The 31-year-old Frenchman will replace Joleon Lescott in the center of the Merseyside club's defence, following the England international's protracted sale to Manchester City. Meanwhile, Portsmouth, who have seen a host of top players leave this summer culminating in Distin's exit, have gone some way to restoring the depth of their squad by bringing in a remarkable four players on a hectic day at Fratton Park. Midfielder Michael Brown, 32, has joined from Wigan for an undisclosed fee while two players have joined on loan; Tottenham midfielder Jamie O'Hara and Ivorian striker Aruna Dindane from Lens with a view to a permanent move. Meanwhile, O'Hara's Tottenham team-mate Kevin-Prince Boateng -- who spent last season on loan at Borussia Dortmund -- has also joined Portsmouth on a three-year contract for a fee of $6.5m. The 22-year-old German midfielder has failed to establish himself at White Hart Lane since joining from Hertha Berlin in 2007. Sunderland have completed their sixth signing of the summer with the capture of Lyon's Ghanaian international defender John Mensah on a season-long loan with a view to a permanent deal. Elsewhere, West Ham have completed the signing of highly-rated striker Alessandro Diamanti from Serie A side Livorno for an undisclosed fee. Diamanti, 26, has penned a five-year contract at Upton Park after agreeing personal terms and passing a medical -- while Stoke have completed the signing of Turkish international striker Tuncay Sanli from Middlesbrough, the day after swooping for German defender Roberth Huth from the same club. In other transfer news, striker Vagner Love has joined former club Palmeiras on loan from CSKA Moscow until summer 2010. The 25-year-old Brazilian joined CSKA from Palmeiras in 2004 and established himself as a firm favorite in the Russian capital -- scoring 61 goals in 118 appearances, winning two Russian titles and a UEFA Cup winners' medal in the process.","Real Madrid complete sale of Dutchmen Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder .

"(CNN) -- French legend Julien Absalon took his status to new heights when he became the first rider to defend the men's mountain bike Olympic title. Sabine Spitz of Germany celebrates her victory in the women's mountain bike on Saturday. Absalon kept the gold in French hands for the third Olympics in a row -- following Miguel Martinez's victory at Sydney in 2000 -- thanks to a commanding display early in the 36km race which left his rivals trailing. ""The Olympic Games is a massive motivation for every athlete and four years passes quickly, as it has from Athens to Beijing,"" said Absalon, who finished well ahead of compatriot Jean-Christophe Peraud with Nino Schurter pipping world champion and Swiss compatriot Christoph Sauser to the bronze medal. A highly-fancied Swiss trio failed to match Absalon's early pace after he had begun to steadily grind out a lead by the second of the eight scheduled laps. ""It's great to do the double. It feels totally different (from 2004), but this just confirms what I achieved in Athens,"" added Absalon, who denied that he had made his victory look easy. ""I had as tough a race as everyone else. When I saw the chance to make the break I went for it. After that I really gave it everything I had."" In the women's 27km mountain bike race, defending champion Gunn-Rita Dahle from Norway was one of several contenders to fall victim to a course that was finally mastered by Germany's Sabine Spitz. The 36-year-old, who only began racing at the relatively late age of 22, was determined to improve on her bronze medal in Athens. She started fast and was soon racing on her own to gold ahead of Poland's Maja Wloszczowska, who finished with the silver ahead of Russian Irina Kalentieva. ""I feel pure joy at what I have finally achieved after so many years of hard work,"" said Spitz. ""Winning the gold medal at the Olympic Games is the crowning glory."" The first boxing medals were decided on Saturday with Felix Diaz of the Dominican Republic winning his country's first ever Olympic boxing title after beating Thailand's Manus Boonjumnong to take the light-welterweight gold. But Thailand made amends in the flyweight final when Somjit Jongjohor comfortably out-pointing Cuban Andris Laffita 8-2 to claim his first Olympic gold. Vasyl Lomachenko of Ukraine won the featherweight gold medal, capping a spectacular run through the tournament with a first-round stoppage of France's Khedafi Djelkhir. James Degale of Britain won the middleweight gold medal, upsetting Cuba's Emilio Correa in a sloppy bout, while Correa failed to emulate his father's gold medal performance for Cuba in 1972. Rakhim Chakhkiev of Russia gained revenge on Italy's world champion Clemente Russo by claiming heavyweight gold. Chakhkiev was beaten by Russo in the final of the world championships. China's Ma Lin won gold in the men's singles table tennis tournament, defeating teammate Wang Hao to secure a clean sweep of all gold medals on offer to the host nation. World number two Ma fought off world number one Wang in a scorching final strewn with fast and furious rallies to win 4-1 and cement China's status as the superpower of the sport. The victory hands China a clean sweep of all six medals in the singles competition, after teammate Wang Liqin removed the last obstacle to the Chinese Wall -- defeating Sweden's veteran Jorgen Persson for the bronze medal. A goal from Christopher Zeller in the 16th minute gave Germany the men's field hockey gold medal by defeating Spain 1-0 in the final. Australia took the bronze with a 6-2 win over the Netherlands in the play-off between the losing semifinalists. Australian Matthew Mitcham won the men's 10m platform diving title to spoil China's bid for a sweep of all eight diving gold medals. China's Zhou Luxin settled for silver, while Russia's Gleb Galperin claimed the bronze medal. Elsewhere, on the penultimate day of competition, Russia won the team event and swept both gold medals in synchronized swimming for the third consecutive Olympics. Russia finished with a combined 99.500 points after Saturday's free routine. Spain took the silver with 98.251 points and China claimed the bronze with 97.334. Anastasia Ermakova and Anastasia Davydova already won gold in the duet on Wednesday and were also part of Russia's eight-woman squad for the team event. Norway's women's handball team won their first Olympic gold medal, beating Russia 34-27 in the final. Norway rushed to an 8-1 lead after just eight minutes and remained well ahead for the rest of Saturday's match. Neither Norway nor Russia has ever won a gold medal in women's handball. Brazil won their first women's volleyball gold medal after defeating the United States 25-15 18-25 25-13 25-21 in a hard-fought final. Saturday also saw the remaining six disciplines decided in the canoeing, with Ken Wallace of Australia winning the gold medal in the men's 500-meter kayak singles. The first-time Olympian won in one minute, 37.252 seconds from Adam van Koeverden of Canada. Briton Tim Brabants took the bronze medal to add to the gold he won in the 1,000m race. Inna Osypenko-Radomska of Ukraine won gold in the women's 500-meter kayak singles, just nipping Italy in a tight finish. Osypenko-Radomska's time of 1:50.673 seconds was enough to just pip Josefa Idem of Italy, with Germany's Katrin Wagner-Augustin taking bronze. Saul Craviotto and Carlos Perez of Spain won gold medal in the men's 500-meter kayak doubles, slipping past the defending Olympic champions for victory. Craviotto and Perez clocked 1:28.736 seconds to edge Ronald Rauhe and Tim Wieskotter into silver in a major shock as the German pair have been world champions since 2001. Raman Piatrushenka and Vadzim Makhneu of Belarus took bronze.

Sergey Ulegin and Alexander Kostoglod of Russia won silver while the German pair of Christian Gille and Thomasz Wylenzek took bronze. Mexico's Maria del Rosario Espinoza won the gold medal in the women's 67kg taekwondo category. Espinoza, the 2007 world champion, easily defeated Norway's Nina Solheim on points after going ahead in the first round and never falling behind. Winning bronze were Britain's Sarah Stevenson, who defeated Egypt's Noha Abd Rabo, and Brazil's Natalia Falavigna, who outscored Sweden's Karolina Kedzierska. Russia's Evgeniya Kanaeva won gold in the rhythmic gymnastics individual all-around competition, posting the highest score in all four rotations of the event. Her final total of 75.500 points was enough to beat Inna Zhukova of Belarus, who gained 71.925 points for the silver. Anna Bessonova of the Ukraine had 71.875 points for her second straight bronze. In women's basketball, Lisa Leslie of the United States capped off her illustrious Olympic career with a fourth straight gold medal, scoring 14 points in a 92-65 victory over Australia.

"(CNN) -- Movie audiences have always known the joys of in-seat snacking, but it took the theaters a while to come around. Owners of nickelodeons and movie palaces refused to sell food until the 1920s, according to ""Shared Pleasures,"" a history of movie presentation by Douglas Gomery.  Munching on peanuts and popcorn during a show was low-class, they believed, associated with the circus and the burlesque house. The wonderful new art of the cinema needed a refined atmosphere, more like the concert hall than the carnival. Of course, people ate anyway. As each new theater opened, candy stores and street vendors set up shop nearby, selling bags of treats to be smuggled past the ushers. It took the Great Depression to loosen the owners' scruples. Andrew F. Smith's book ""Popped Culture"" details the way movie theaters got into the popcorn business. Looking for extra revenue streams, the theaters began leasing space to vendors: prime locations right next to the box office, or even ""lobby privileges"" for a dollar a day. When they saw the kind of profits the popcorn sellers were turning, they took over the stands themselves. The movies turned popcorn into a snack phenomenon: 5 million pounds were grown in the United States in 1934, 100 million pounds in 1940. The owners also realized that setting up candy counters and staffing them with high school students (preferably female and pretty) was an easy way to turn a buck, and all the new brands of packaged candy made their way into theaters. Soft drinks showed up via the Coca-Cola company. After World War II, salesmen traveled the land, setting up soda stands at movie houses throughout the country. With more and more independent theaters opening (A 1948 antitrust ruling forbade Hollywood studios from running their own.), owners looked to the refreshment stands as a way to cover the cost of renting films. Trying to sell more snacks, they instituted intermissions in the middle of films and commissioned cartoons of singing, dancing treats to push the goods. Art houses, showing foreign films to an urbane crowd, began to pop up in big cities and university towns in the late '40s. As historian Barbara Wilinsky points out in her 2001 study ""Sure Seaters: the Emergence of Art House Cinema,"" the new highbrow theaters tried to distinguish themselves from mainstream joints by serving coffee and pastries: more intellectual fare, apparently. The arty Trans-Lux chain even set up faux-Parisian ""street"" cafes in some of its branches. In most of the country, though, the drive-in ruled. With more space available, the menu expanded: hot dogs, burgers, even barbecue and fried fish sandwiches were offered to car-bound audiences. (Folks in Texas got pickles, which are still served there today.) The late '70s saw the death of the drive-in and the neighborhood theater as more multiplexes opened. On the food front, the bold invention of the era was snack counter nachos. Introduced by Frank Liberto at a Texas Rangers game in 1977, chips with gooey ""cheese"" soon moved from stadium to multiplex lobby. Liberto's company, Ricos Products, is still the leader in the field, selling orange goo and orange-goo-dispensing equipment to theaters from China to Dubai. Another company, Taste of Nature, founded in 1992 by two business school graduates, also broadened the movie snack menu. They're the people who brought those bulk bins of yogurt pretzels and gummy candies to lobbies everywhere. Their original goal was to offer healthy alternatives to the usual snack counter candy, but they discovered that people weren't quite ready to give up the junk. Health was on people's mind in the '90s however: A1994 report by the Center for Science in the Public Interest broke the news that a large movie popcorn had as much saturated fat as six Big Macs. Sales dipped -- just a bit Â­-- and many snack counters started using slightly more healthy canola oil rather than coconut. The latest trend is theaters offering ""luxury"" options: premium screening rooms with cocktails, wine lists and upscale menus. At the Gold Class Cinema in Redmond, Washington, you can get $17 crab cakes to nibble while watching the film. Florida's CinÃ©Bistro chain offers Asian mojitos and bottles of Veuve Clicquot (straw not included). It seems some theater owners are still hoping to create that refined atmosphere they longed for a century ago. Popcorn, though, is not going anywhere.","Movie theater owners originally didn't want to sell food, believing it was low-class .

"(CNN) -- Middle-Eastern investment is continuing apace in the English Premier League despite the tough economic climate, with Dubai-based Sulaiman Al Fahim completing his long-awaited takeover of Portsmouth. Sulaiman Al Fahim has continued his interest in English football with a buyout of Portsmouth. Al Fahim, a board member of the Abu Dhabi United Group which bought out Manchester City a year ago, has been named chairman of the cash-strapped club after passing the EPL's ""fit and proper"" ownership test. He replaces Alexandre Gaydamak, who became co-owner of the south-coast club in January 2006 and took over full control six months later. Gaydamak initially invested a lot of money in Portsmouth, but with the economic downturn taking its toll, he announced last December he could no longer devote enough time to the club. Al Fahim, who spearheaded the City takeover before Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan emerged as the main backer, struck a deal with Gaydamak in late May before undergoing legal and financial due diligence. The subsequent uncertainty at Fratton Park saw full-back Glen Johnson join Liverpool in a $28 million deal, while England team-mate Peter Crouch has been allowed to talk to other clubs after voicing his unhappiness. ""This appointment brings stability to the club and is excellent news for Pompey supporters,"" chief executive Peter Storrie, who will retain his position, told Portsmouth's official Web site on Tuesday. ""I have every reason to believe that together with the new chairman we will be able to take the club forward to further achievements, building on the successes of the past three years."" Portsmouth won the prestigious FA Cup two years ago and qualified for the UEFA Cup, but the club's momentum was derailed when manager Harry Redknapp left to take over at EPL rivals Tottenham then his replacement Tony Adams was sacked after a poor run of results. Paul Hart was brought in as caretaker manager in February and saved Pompey from relegation -- and Al Fahim made his first job as chairman to reward the former Nottingham Forest boss with a two-year contract. ""Paul did a great job keeping the team in the Premier League last season, and having previously worked as director of youth operations he knows the club inside out,"" Al Fahim said. ""He has immense experience and a great knowledge of the game, and commands the respect of the players. I'm looking forward to working with him."" Born in 1977, Al Fahim started his own business at the age of 18 and moved to the United States after his parents and brother died in a road accident when he was 21. A keen chess player, he is chairman of the United Arab Emirates Chess Association, while he is the host of business-themed reality television show Hydra Executives. Hydra has sports sponsorship interests in Dubai, Costa Rica and Germany's Bundesliga. Meanwhile, Sunderland manager Steve Bruce has given up on signing Crouch following talks with the 28-year-old. The Black Cats had agreed a fee for the gangly former Liverpool frontman, but he now appears set to return to his native London with either Fulham or Tottenham. ""Naturally this is hugely disappointing for us as Peter was one of our primary targets,"" Bruce told his club's official Web site. ""I know he was impressed with the set up here when he came for talks, but it's simply a matter of geographical location and that's not something we can affect. ""What's pleasing however is that it shows the intent of the club going forward that we are trying to bring in players of his caliber, and we will continue to pursue other targets. ""We have a number of irons in the fire at present and we will be looking to make several additions to our squad in the coming weeks.""","Dubai-based billionaire Sulaiman Al Fahim completes takeover of Portsmouth .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama, meeting with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak in Seoul on Thursday, said he will send envoy Stephen Bosworth to North Korea next month for bilateral talks on dismantling Pyongyang's nuclear program. ""If North Korea is prepared to take concrete and irreversible steps to fulfill its obligations and eliminate its nuclear weapons program, the United States will support economic assistance and help promote its full integration into the community of nations,"" Obama said. ""That opportunity and respect will not come with threats. North Korea must live up to its obligations."" Bosworth's trip is slated for December 8. ""Convincing North Korea to give up their nuclear program, it is not a simple matter,"" according to Lee, who said there's no deadline, at the joint news conference with Obama. ""It's not going to be easy, but I believe it is possible that we can resolve this issue peacefully."" The development comes at the end of the U.S. president's tour of Asia, which included stops in Japan, Singapore and China before his visit to South Korea. In recent weeks North Korea has sought direct talks with the United States in what American officials saw as a possible re-entry to full negotiations with the United States and other countries over ending Pyongyang's nuclear program. A Bosworth mission had already been announced, but a date was not previously mentioned publicly. The United States has been careful to describe the trip as only a limited diplomatic foray and one not designed to replace the fuller negotiations. ""From our standpoint, the purpose will be to facilitate the early resumption of the six-party talks,"" P.J. Crowley said at a U.S. State Department briefing last week. The so-called six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program had come to a standstill. But the Bosworth trip could lead to new negotiations between North Korea and the United States, South Korea, Japan and Russia and China. ""We are very realistic about our expectations,"" he said. ""We come to this meeting prepared to engage North Korea in the context of the six-party talks, but obviously the bottom line here is that North Korea has to take affirmative steps toward denuclearization. That remains our core objective.""","United States careful to describe Bosworth trip as only limited diplomatic foray .

"LAHORE, Pakistan (CNN) -- Former Pakistani prime minister and opposition figure Nawaz Sharif arrived in Pakistan's second-largest city Sunday, where he plans to end seven years in exile and directly participate in upcoming elections. Nawaz Sharif arrived amid a crowd of uniformed security personnel and throngs of cheering supporters . He arrived at Lahore's airport on a jet provided by the Saudi government at around 6:30 p.m. (8:30 a.m. ET). He emerged amid a crowd of uniformed security personnel and throngs of cheering supporters at the airport, where security was on high alert. Speaking to CNN just moments before his plane departed from Medina, Saudi Arabia, Sharif denied reports that he struck a deal with President Pervez Musharraf's government that would allow him to return to Pakistan. ""I haven't met any Pakistani government functionary over the last eight years, although there were a lot of overtures from the Pakistani side to meet me and to talk to me,"" Sharif said Sunday afternoon. He said he has not changed his position on Musharraf, the man who overthrew him in a bloodless military coup in 1999. ""He is not a legitimate president of the country; I do not accept that, not at all,"" Sharif said. It is the second time Sharif has arrived in Pakistan this year. He was quickly deported back to Saudi Arabia by Musharraf's government when he tried to return in September. Political observers doubt he will be turned away this time. Pakistani police set up on roadblocks leading into Lahore and the government had warned Sharif supporters they would be blocked from entering the city. Pakistani police launched a crackdown on Sharif supporters ahead of his arrival, arresting several hundred at their homes and stopping hundreds more who were traveling to Lahore to welcome him, authorities and eyewitnesses told CNN. Former Pakistani prime minister and opposition leader Benazir Bhutto returned to Pakistan in October, after eight years in self-imposed exile. While traveling from the Karachi airport, her motorcade was attacked, killing 136 people. She was unharmed. Sharif -- who leads the opposition party Pakistan Muslim League -- said he has been talking to Bhutto ""trying to find common ground"" in uniting the opposition to Musharraf's government. ""We both have been interacting over the past few days, so let's see what comes out of it,"" Sharif said. Sharif, like other opposition leaders, was highly critical of Bhutto for discussing a power-sharing government with Musharraf. Those talks ended when Musharraf imposed a state of emergency on November 3. Sharif said that while his alliance -- the All Pakistan Democratic Movement (APDM) -- is preparing to participate in the January elections, they will only take part if Musharraf withdraws the emergency declaration and releases opposition members who have been jailed. ""Everything that was done must be reversed and drawn back completely,"" he said. ""Just withdrawing emergency will not be enough,"" he said. ""You must have a level playing field for free and fair elections."" Asked if he could ever agree to a power sharing deal with Musharraf as president and he as prime minister, Sharif answered, ""No, no, no, no question."" Sharif said he refused recent attempts by Musharraf to meet with him in Saudi Arabia. Sharif said he rejected the offer because the two men ""are poles apart."" Musharraf met with Saudi leaders last week -- his first trip since imposing the state of emergency -- raising speculation that an understanding was reached with the Saudi government that prompted their support of Sharif's return from exile. A spokesman for Musharraf told CNN Sunday there was no agreement or understanding with Sharif. Saudi authorities have been pushing Pakistan to allow Sharif back in the country. In addition to his aircraft to Lahore, the Saudi royal family also has provided him with a bulletproof car in Lahore, according to one of his deputies and a government source. Convicted of terrorism, hijacking and tax evasion after Musharraf seized power in 1999, Sharif was released in 2000 in exchange for agreeing to 10 years of exile in Saudi Arabia. He retained his Pakistani citizenship but has not been allowed to travel to Pakistan or directly take part in Pakistani politics. On his arrival, Sharif plans to visit the shrine of a Sufi saint, then go to his home in Lahore. He also plans to visit the burial site of his father, who died while Sharif was in exile. The former official has no plans to call a news conference but was to make a statement at the airport in Pakistan. Last week, Pakistan's Supreme Court -- recently stacked by Musharraf with his allies -- ruled against the last challenge blocking the ratification of last month's presidential election. On Saturday, the election commission officially notified the federal government that Musharraf won. The move clears the path for him to take the oath of office for the third time, which he has vowed to do after stepping down as the country's military chief. No date has been set for the swearing-in.

"Editor's note: Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst and a fellow at the New America Foundation in Washington and at New York University's Center on Law and Security. His most recent book is ""The Osama bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of al Qaeda's Leader."" Peter Bergen says it's crucial to correctly frame the nature of a war before beginning it. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama and his foreign policy advisers and speechwriters are wrestling with one of the most important speeches of his presidency, his inaugural address. One of their toughest conceptual challenges is how to describe and recast what the Bush administration has consistently termed the ""war on terror."" The dean of military strategists, Carl von Clausewitz, explains the importance of this decision-making in his treatise ""On War"": ""The first, the supreme, the most decisive act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish...the kind of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for, nor trying to turn it into something that is alien to its nature."" Clausewitz's excellent advice about the absolute necessity of properly defining the war upon which a nation is about to embark was ignored by Bush administration officials who instead declared an open-ended and ambiguous ""war on terror"" after the United States was attacked on September 11, 2001. Bush took the nation to war against a tactic, rather than a war against a specific enemy, which was obviously al Qaeda and anyone allied to it. When the United States went to war against the Nazis and the Japanese during World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt and his congressional supporters did not declare war against U-boats and kamikaze pilots, but on the Nazi state and Imperial Japan. The war on terror, sometimes known as the ""Global War on Terror"" or by the clunky acronym GWOT, became the lens through which the Bush administration judged almost all of its foreign policy decisions. That proved to be dangerously counterproductive on several levels. The GWOT framework propelled the Bush administration into its disastrous entanglement in Iraq. It had nothing to do with 9/11 but was launched under the rubric of the war on terror and the erroneous claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The theory was that he might give such weapons to terrorists, including al Qaeda to whom he was supposedly allied, and that he therefore threatened American interests. None of this, of course, turned out to be true. The Bush administration's approach to the war on terror collided badly with another of its doctrines, spreading democracy in the Middle East as a panacea to reduce radicalism. It pushed for elections in the Palestinian territories in which, in early 2006, the more radical Hamas won a resounding victory, propelled to power on a wave of popular revulsion for the incompetence and corruption of the Fatah party that had dominated Palestinian politics since the 1960s. Imprisoned by its war on terror framework, the Bush administration supported Israel in a disastrous war against Hezbollah in Lebanon in the summer of 2006. Hezbollah is not only a terrorist group but is also part of the rickety Lebanese government and runs social welfare services across the country, yet for the Bush administration its involvement in terrorism was all that mattered. As is now widely understood in Israel, the war against Hezbollah was a moral and tactical defeat for the Israeli military and government. Events in the current Israeli incursion in Gaza will determine whether history repeats itself. Under the banner of the war on terror, the Bush administration also tied itself in conceptual knots conflating the threat from al Qaeda with Shiite groups like Hezbollah and the ayatollahs in Iran. In 2006, for instance, President Bush claimed that ""the Sunni and Shiite extremist represent different faces of the same threat."" In reality, Sunni and Shiite extremists have been killing each other in large numbers for years in countries from Pakistan to Iraq. The groups have differing attitudes toward the United States, which Sunni extremists attacked in 1993 and again on 9/11, while Shiite militants have never done so. So, how to reconceptualize the GWOT? Contrary to a common view among Europeans, who have lived through the bombing campaigns of various nationalist and leftist terror groups for decades, al Qaeda is not just another criminal/terrorist group that can be dealt with by police action and law enforcement alone. After all, a terrorist organization like the Irish Republican Army would call in warnings before its attacks and its single largest massacre killed 29 people. By contrast, al Qaeda has declared war on the United States repeatedly -- as it did for the first time to a Western audience during Osama bin Laden's 1997 interview with CNN. Following that declaration of war, the terror group attacked American embassies, a U.S. warship, the Pentagon and the financial heart of the United States, killing thousands of civilians without warning; acts of war by any standard. Al Qaeda is obviously at war with the United States and so to respond by simply recasting the GWOT as the GPAT, the Global Police Action Against Terrorists, would be foolish and dangerous. What kind of war then should the United States fight against al Qaeda? For that we should learn some lessons from the conceptual errors of the Bush administration. Nine days after 9/11, Bush addressed Congress in a speech watched live by tens of millions of Americans in which he said that al Qaeda followed in the footsteps ""of the murderous ideologies of the 20th century...They follow in the path of fascism, Nazism and totalitarianism,"" implying that the fight against al Qaeda would be similar to World War II or the Cold War. For the Bush administration, painting the conflict in such existential terms had the benefit of casting the president as the heroic reincarnation of Winston Churchill and anyone who had the temerity to question him as the reincarnation of Hitler's arch-appeaser, Neville Chamberlain. But this portrayal of the war on terror was massively overwrought. The Nazis occupied and subjugated most of Europe and instigated a global conflict that killed tens of millions. And when the United States fought the Nazis, the country spent 40 percent of its gross domestic product to do so and fielded millions of soldiers. In his inaugural address, Obama should say that the United States is indeed at ""war against al Qaeda and its allies,"" but that as Roosevelt said in his inaugural address in 1933, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. If Americans are not terrorized by terrorists, then the U.S. has won against them. Al Qaeda and its allies are threats to the United States and Americans living and working overseas, but they are far from all-powerful. Barring an exceptional event like September 11, 2001, in any given year Americans are more likely to die of snake bites or lightning strikes than a terrorist attack. Despite the hyperventilating rhetoric of Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda's amateur investigations into weapons of mass destruction do not compare to the very real possibility of nuclear conflagration that we faced during the Cold War. There are relatively few adherents of Binladen-ism in the West today, while there were tens of millions of devotees of communism and fascism. Obama should also make it clear that instead of the Bush formulation of ""Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists,"" the Obama administration doctrine will be, ""Anyone who is against the terrorists is with us."" After all it is only al Qaeda and its several affiliates in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Algeria and allied groups such as the Taliban that kill U.S. soldiers and civilians and attack American interests around the globe. Everyone else in the world is a potential or actual ally in the fight against al Qaeda and its affiliates, because those organizations threaten almost every category of institution, government and ethnic grouping. This is the first of two commentaries on the war on terror.

"(CNN) -- Argentina will be missing striker Diego Milito for the final two World Cup qualifiers against Peru and Uruguay as Diego Maradona's struggling team battle to reach the finals in 2010. Diego Milito has had only a bit-part role for Argentina despite his good form for Inter Milan. Milito is expected to be sidelined for the next month after injuring his thigh while playing for Italian champions Inter Milan on Saturday. The 30-year-old was replaced by Mario Balotelli 25 minutes into the 2-1 victory against Udinese at the San Siro, and scans have shown that he suffered a first-degree strain in his right thigh. The Albiceleste go into Saturday's home clash with Peru on a run of four defeats in the last five games which has left the team outside the top-four automatic qualifying spots. While bottom side Peru have no chance of qualifying, Wednesday's opponents Uruguay lie just a point behind Argentina in sixth and will be hoping to at least clinch the play-off position in the South American zone. Milito has made a flying start to his career with Inter this season, scoring five goals in his first seven games, but he has had only a bit-part role in Argentina's qualifying campaign so far. Coach Maradona, who can call on the likes of Lionel Messi, Sergio Aguero, Carlos Tevez and Ezequiel Lavezzi up front, has retained Boca Juniors striker Martin Palermo in his squad. Palermo scored both goals in the 2-0 friendly win over Ghana last week, and was also on target for his club at the weekend in a 3-2 victory against Velez Sarsfield. Enzo Perez is also added to the 26-man squad after making his debut against the Africans, along with Estudiantes teammate Juan Sebastian Veron and Velez Sarsfield defender Nicolas Otamendi. Colon goalkeeper Diego Pozo, Newell's Old Boys defender Rolando Schiavi, Boca duo Federico Insua and Luciano Fabian Monzon and Huracan midfielder Mario Bolatti are also included among the home-based players.","Argentina striker Diego Milito ruled out of the final two World Cup qualifiers .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It's fair to say David Beckham may be seeing more green off the football pitch than he does on it. Reason to smile: David Beckham is the highest-earning footballer in the world, according to Forbes . Despite a difficult and expensive period negotiating an extended release from his LA Galaxy club -- Beckham has been named as the world's highest-earning footballer by Forbes magazine. The magazine has ranked the top 20 top-paid footballers in the world -- a list that includes many of today's top players and some ageing heroes who are still rolling in cash. The 33-year-old Beckham, currently on loan with Italian club AC Milan as part of an extended deal from LA Galaxy, earned an estimated $46 million last year, according to Forbes. It calculates that the Briton has earned $95m in the past two years -- $66m of which has come from endorsement contracts. Although his long-running deal with Pepsi ended in December last year, his currently resurgent career is likely to provide a boost for the coming few seasons. Behind Beckham in the Forbes list is his Brazilian AC Milan team-mate, Ronaldinho, who earned an estimated $33m in 2008. Rounding out the top five places are (respectively); Thierry Henry, Kaka and last year's FIFA World Player of the Year, Cristiano Ronaldo. See our gallery of the top twenty highest-paid footballers in the world, according to Forbes Â» . Ronaldo's earnings of $21 million came primarily from his Manchester United wages ($12m), while endorsements from companies such as Nike and Coca-Cola made up the remaining $9m. The Portugal player's namesake -- Brazilian Ronaldo -- is still on the list at number 12, having earned $15m despite being sidelined for much of the year with a serious knee injury and returning to his homeland to play club football. Partner in the Sports Business group at Deloitte, Dan Jones, told CNN that only a ""tiny percentage"" of footballers earned more from product endorsements than they do from their player wages. ""It's only the very, very top. For the vast majority of footballers, the wages they earn from their clubs will be their greatest source of income."" Jones said Beckham's continuing popularity beyond the world of football in both the U.S. and in Europe would likely ensure he remains around the top of the rich list for a few years to come. ""He is now a grand icon that in some sense transcends what he does on the football field,"" Jones said. However, Jones added he was impressed with the way Beckham had made strong efforts to reinstate his image as being primarily a footballer over the last 18 months.

"(CNN) -- Roma moved up to sixth place in the Serie A table after a 1-0 victory in the Rome 'derby' against city rivals Lazio. Substitute full-back Marco Cassetti scored the only goal in the 79th minute, finding the corner of the net with a scuffed shot from Mirko Vucinic's cross. Lazio had enjoyed the better of the chances in a tight matchm with Mauro Zarate striking the post on the hour mark -- before Roma goalkeeper Julio Sergio made an instinctive one-handed save from Stefano Mauri's follow-up. Roma were reduced to 10 men in the 88th minute when David Pizarro picked up his second yellow card, but they held on for the victory on a match that was held up for 10 minutes in the first-half because of crowd disturbances. In Sunday's other matches, Jonathan Biabiany scored twice as Parma drew 2-2 away to Genoa to keep hold of fourth in the table. With Italy's top three all playing on Saturday, Parma came into the match in fourth after Sampdoria's 3-0 defeat at AC Milan on Saturday dropped them down to fifth overnight. Rodrigo Palacio initially put Genoa in position to take fourth themselves with a 14th minute opener. But Biabiany struck on 36 and 59 minutes to give Parma the lead before Raffaelle Palladino equalized eight minutes later, leaving Genoa in seventh position. At one point during the afternoon Cagliari, who had won five of their last six matches and beat Juventus 2-0 a week ago, had looked in pole position to go fourth as they led 1-0 at Palermo at halftime through Alessandro Matri. But goals from Igor Budan and Simon Kjaer 10 minutes apart gave Delio Rossi his first win as coach of the Sicilians. Fiorentina moved up to fifth after their 2-0 home win over Atalanta ended their two-match losing streak. Peru international Juan Vargas opened the scoring on 26 minutes with a left-foot rocket from outside the box and Italy forward Alberto Gilardino clinched the victory a minute from time. The race for fourth is now so tight that Parma are only five points above Palermo in 13th place. Napoli extended their unbeaten run since Walter Mazzarri took over from Roberto Donadoni to nine matches in all competitions as Fabio Quagliarella scored a brace, including the winner two minutes from time, in a 3-2 success at home to Bari. Bari led 2-1 after an hour through goals from Paulo Barreto and Andrea Ranocchia but then had Alessandro Parisi dismissed. Cristian Maggio restored parity before Quagliarella's late winner while Bari ended with nine men as Ranocchia also saw red late on.

"(CNN) -- A 2005 cable by the U.S. ambassador to Botswana criticized how the southern African nation's government handled the removal of Bushmen people from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, according to the document obtained by WikiLeaks and published Thursday by London's Guardian newspaper. The cable by former Ambassador Joseph Huggins described a visit to the government-run Bushmen settlement called New Xade outside the reserve where hundreds of Bushmen lived after being forced to leave the protected area. ""It is also clear that people have been dumped in economically absolutely unviable situations without forethought, and without follow-up support,"" said the cable bearing Huggins' name at the bottom. ""The lack of imagination displayed on the part of the GOB (government of Botswana) is breathtaking."" The Bushmen, traditional hunter-gatherers indigenous to arid regions of southern Africa including the desert interior of Botswana, were forced out of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve by the government in 2002. The government said human inhabitants were out of place in a wilderness reserve, but the Bushmen and their advocates argued the government was clearing the way to launch the lucrative mining for diamonds, the country's economic mainstay. On Monday, Botswana's government granted a 25-year, $3 billion mining license to Gem Diamonds for an area that includes the part of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, claimed as indigenous homeland by the Bushmen. The cable, if authentic, doesn't represent the current situation, Jeff Ramsey a spokesman for the Botswana government, said in an e-mailed statement. ""It is at best a snapshot of one individual's own initial assessment at a point in time,"" he said. Ramsey said the government has ""engaged in a wide range of economic empowerment initiatives"" for those affected by the relocation, including providing livestock, small business mentoring and other services. ""It has been and remains Government's view that the establishment of New Xade has increased both the immediate and long-term opportunities for economic and social development of its residents, as is reflected in the village's ongoing growth,"" he said. In a separate but related matter, an appeals court in Botswana will rule as soon as next week on whether Bushmen who have returned to the game reserve have the right to use a water well, known as a borehole, near their settlement. Last year, Justice Lakhvinder Singh Walia ruled against the Bushmen, saying they could choose to live closer to where water and other essential services were available outside the reserve. At an appeals court hearing this week, the lawyer for the Bushmen told the five appellate judges that the Bushmen had a lawful and constitutional right to live in the game reserve. In addition, the lawyer, barrister Gordon Bennett, said the nation's Water Act allows any legal occupant of land to dig a borehole for domestic use. In response, the lawyer for the government told the appellate panel that the government was not obliged to restore resources for the Bushmen in the game reserve.

"(CNN) -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger can expect an apology from Premier League referees chief Keith Hackett following his dismissal in the closing seconds of Saturday's 2-1 English Premier League defeat to Manchester United. Arsene Wenger has to stand with Manchester United fans after being sent off at Old Trafford. League Managers Association chief executive Richard Bevan has spoken to Hackett about the Old Trafford incident which saw Wenger sent to the stands by referee Mike Dean on the advice of fourth official Lee Probert. And he has been told that Wenger will receive an apology from the Premier Game Match Officials Board which appoints officials to top-flight games in England. The Gunners manager caught Probert's attention when he kicked an empty water bottle down the touchline following a disallowed goal for Arsenal. There was then confusion as Wenger seemed unaware of where he was supposed to go -- moving first to the back of Arsenal dugout then starting to walk down the touchline as the whistle was blown. On the decision to penalize Wenger, Bevan said: ""Although correct in 'law', it was completely out of context in the game and it was followed by the nonsense which followed over where Arsene Wenger should sit to watch the game."" He added: ""I've spoken to Keith Hackett and he fully recognizes the situation was an error and an apology will follow to Arsene Wenger. ""Lee Probert totally failed to manage the situation and created a needless pressure point taking the focus away from the pitch in a big event with only a minute to go."" Meanwhile, Arsenal's north London rivals Tottenham have suffered a setback with a serious injury to Croatia playmaker Luka Modric. The 23-year-old broke his leg in Saturday's 2-1 victory against Birmingham, which left the club second in the English Premier League after four wins from four. ""X-rays have determined that Luka Modric sustained a fracture to his right fibula,"" said a statement on the official Spurs Web site. Tottenham did not indicate how long the midfielder would be sidelined, but he is likely to miss the home game against champions Manchester United and the trip to Chelsea which follow the upcoming international break. Croatia play England at Wembley on September 9 in a crucial World Cup qualifier.","Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is to receive an apology from referee's chief .

"(CNN)  -- Real Madrid striker Alvaro Negredo has been sold to Spanish Primera Liga rivals Sevilla in a reported $21 million deal. Negredo scores for Real Madrid in the Peace Cup earlier this month. The highly-rated Negredo was surplus to requirements at Real, who are looking to recoup some of the massive $363 million they have spent in the close season transfer window. Negredo has signed a five-year deal at Sevilla, but Real Madrid confirmed on their official Web site www.realmadrid.com that they had the option to buy him back for the next two years. Negredo only rejoined Real last month having been loaned out to Almeria for the past two seasons, scoring 19 goals in the last campaign. But he would have been struggling to win a regular first team place after the club's signings of Kaka, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo over the summer. Negredo completed his move after having a medical in Sevilla on Friday morning with last season's third-placers in La Liga clearly delighted with their acquisition. ""Sevilla have recruited one of the best strikers in Europe,"" the club said in a statement on their official Web site.","Real Madrid striker Alvaro Negredo completes his permanent move to Sevilla .

"(CNN)  -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice for Real Madrid as they won 3-1 in Marseille on Tuesday to top Group C of Champions League qualifying. Real's victory meant AC Milan went through in second place in the group despite held 1-1 at FC Zurich, owing their draw to a second half penalty from Ronaldinho. Former World Player of the Year Ronaldo scored in the fifth and 80th minutes in a comfortable win for the Spanish giants and showed he is back to his very best after an injury layoff. The Portuguese star opened his account with a blistering 30 meter free kick, but Marseille midfielder Lucho Gonzalez leveled from close range six minutes later. Real's Raul Albiol put them ahead on the hour mark before Lucho hit the crossbar from the penalty spot soon afterwards. Ronaldo added his second in the 80th after a mistake by home goalkeeper Steve Mandanda left him with a conversion into an open goal. Swiss side Zurich tested Milan and after dominating the first half went ahead in the 29th minute through a Milan Gajic free kick from outside the area. Zurich had shocked Milan 1-0 in the San Siro in October, but were reduced to 10 men in the 64th minute when Marco Borriello was hacked down by defender Alain Rochat, who was sent off. Brazilian ace Ronaldo converted the spot kick to grab a precious point for his side against the group's bottom side. Chelsea had already clinched top spot in Group D but put on a lackluster display to be held 2-2 at Stamford Bridge by APOEL Nicosia. Marcin Zewlakow's early opener for APOEL gave the Cyprus side a shock lead before Michael Essien and Didier Drogba put Chelsea ahead before half-time. But Chelsea, who had gone into the game off the back of two defeats, were made to pay for a defensive error by John Obi Mikel as Nenad Mirosavljevic scored a late equalizer. The other qualifiers Porto rounded off their campaign with a 3-0 win over third-placed Atletico Madrid. Bruno Alves headed Porto into the lead after two minutes with Falcao scoring the second on 14 minutes. Brazilian Hulk completed the victory with a fine third after 76 minutes after a mazy run and shot.","Cristiano Ronaldo scores twice as Real Madrid top Group C by beating Marseille 3-1 .

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan's title defense got back on track with a crushing 4-0 win over city rivals AC Milan, after three first-half strikes capitalized on the sending off of Rossoneri skipper Gennaro Gattuso on Saturday night at the San Siro. New boys Samuel Eto'o (left) and Wesley Sneijder celebrate Inter's impressive victory over Milan. Thiago Motta put Jose Mourinho's men in the lead, scoring his first goal for the club after thirty minutes with a left-foot strike, after being played in by fellow new recruit Samuel Eto'o. The Cameroon striker was involved again for the second when he was fouled when through on goal by an injury-hampered Gattuso to win a penalty for his side, before Diego Milito slotted home from the spot on 36 minutes. Worse followed for Gattuso when the midfielder received a red card for a tough tackle on Inter debutante Wesley Sneijder, before Brazil full back Maicon took advantage of his opponent's reduced numbers by shooting home form the edge of the area seconds before half time. Further humiliation came in the second half for the nominal home side when Serbian Dejan Stankovic crashed home a 30-yard drive to leave Marco Storari to pick the ball form his net for the fourth time that evening with 23 minutes of the game left. It was a miserable first derby for AC Milan coach Leonardo, who is in the process of rebuilding his side after the departure of former world footballer of the year Kaka to Spanish giants Real Madrid. Where the Rossoneri have lost talent to Spain, Inter have gained; with former Iberian charges Sneijder and Eto'o contributing well to their side's win. Holland midfielder Sneijder tested goalkeeper Storari after only six minutes to signal his team's intent while Eto'o had a key role in the following two goals. Eto'o also had a goal disallowed as he headed into the net from an offside position to cap a telling performance that was in stark contrast to that of Holland international Klass-Jan Huntelaar who made an inauspicious debut for Milan after leaving Real Madrid. Sully Muntari came on as a second-half substitute, seemingly confirming Mourinho's belief that the player had reduced energy levels as a result of fasting for Ramadan. Elsewhere in Serie A, Bari drew 0-0 with Bologna despite substitute Ferdinando Sforzini being sent off for the home side as the game drew to a close. In a game of few chances Daniele De Vezze went closest to opening the scoring for the hosts.","Inter thrash rivals AC Milan 4-0 in derby after Gennaro Gattuso is sent off .

"(CNN) -- Liverpool director Tom Hicks Jr has resigned from his position with the club and their parent company Kop Holdings in the wake of a foul-mouthed e-mail rant at a fan. The American, son of co-owner Tom Hicks, became embroiled in controversy  when it emerged he had responded abusively when one supporter contacted him directly about the state of the Premier League club and their finances. Hicks Jr subsequently apologized but he has now quit the club. The Spirit of Shankly fans' group, who are committed to the removal of American co-owners Hicks Sr and George Gillett, had called for Hicks Jr to resign. However, with his father as co-owner it appeared there would be little pressure from the top to do so. Hicks Jr was seen as a key player on Anfield's board -- comprised of Hicks and his father, Gillett and his son Foster and managing director Christian Purslow. At the same time Liverpool announced his departure, they revealed a re-structuring of the boardroom of both club and Kop Holdings. Casey Coffman, executive vice-president of Hicks Holdings, is the man brought in to replace Hicks Jr while Liverpool's chief financial officer Philip Nash and the club's commercial director Ian Ayre are have also both been elected to both companies. Purslow, Nash and Ayre have played increasingly important roles in the last few months as they work towards putting the club on a healthier financial footing. That has already led to the signing of a new shirt sponsorship deal with Standard Chartered Bank worth around $120 million. One of Purslow's priorities since taking over from Rick Parry in June last year has been to find new investment in the club as they seek to get the funding in place to build a new stadium. Hicks Jr had no real input into decision-making at the club on a daily basis and so his departure will not affect on-going plans.","Liverpool director Tom Hicks Jr has resigned from his position with the club and parent company Kop Holdings .

After passing a medical and agreeing terms Rodriguez put pen to paper on the deal, which is subject to international clearance. Manager Rafa Benitez told the club's official Web site. ""We were looking for players with character and a good mentality. ""He has played for Argentina and Atletico Madrid and is a player with personality. He can play in three positions -- on the right, left or as a second striker -- and is someone with a very positive mentality, which is what we are looking for. ""He is comfortable on the ball, can pass and keep possession. He is good at getting into the box and scoring goals and a good finisher. Every year he gets five to 15 goals from the right side of midfield.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- After an off-season of big-money transfers and endless speculation in Spain the focus finally turns to matters on the pitch. The first round of La Liga fixtures kick off this weekend and Fanzone details what to expect from the new campaign: . So what's new? No sooner had Barcelona wrapped up an historic treble than all of the focus shifted to rivals Real Madrid following the much-vaunted return of Florentino Perez as the club's president. The start of Perez's latest spell at the Santiago Bernabeu has seen a revival of the 'Galacticos' policy of the early 2000s as the club cherry-picked star players from around Europe in a bid to recapture former glories. Los Merengues smashed the world transfer record twice in a week as winger Cristiano Ronaldo arrived from Manchester United for $130 million hot on the heels of the signing of Brazilian playmaker Kaka from AC Milan for $92m. Who do you think will win La Liga? Sound Off below. Karim Benzema, Xabi Alonso, Raul Albiol, Alvaro Arbeloa and Esteban Granero were also brought to the club as Real splashed out a whopping $365m on new players. Barcelona clinched the signing of Zlatan Ibrahimovic from Inter Milan with Samuel Eto'o moving in the opposite direction while Inter's attacking full-back Maxwell also arrived at the Nou Camp. Real's frenzied activity in the transfer market has somewhat overshadowed the appointment of former Villarreal coach Manuel Pellegrini in place of interim boss Juande Ramos while Ernesto Valverde takes over from the Chilean at El Madrigal. Other managerial changes see Jose Angel Ziganda take charge of Xerez in their debut season in La Liga while Juan Ramon Lopez Muniz has left Racing Santander for Malaga with Juan Carlos Mandia the new man in the hot seat at El Sardinero. Elsewhere, the start of Espanyol's first season at their new Cornella-El Prat stadium has been overshadowed by the shock death of 26-year-old captain Daniel Jarque who suffered a heart attack after training during preseason. New signings Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka will play a key role in Real Madrid's quest to win the La Liga title. Key players: It is hard to look beyond the potent attacking threat of Ronaldo, Kaka and Benzema who are all set to make their La Liga debuts for Real Madrid. But it could well be that Alonso's decision to return to Spain which will prove the most decisive, especially if the midfielder can replicate the kind of form he showed in his final season at Liverpool. Ibrahimovic's move to Barcelona raised a few eyebrows and how Pep Guardiola manages to fuse the enigmatic Sweden international with the talents of Lionel Messi, Thierry Henry et al will be crucial to whether they can match the success of last season.  Diego Forlan found the net 32 times to secure the Pichichi award for the most goals in La Liga and his partnership with fellow striker Sergio Aguero will provide the backbone of their hopes of improving on last season's fourth place. Will Real Madrid's expensive new signings deliver the La Liga title? Sound Off below. Elsewhere, David Villa remains the main man at Valencia while big things are expected of talented young winger Diego Perotti at Sevilla after making his debut last term. Despite intense speculation Valencia have kept hold of David  Villa for their final season at the Mestalla. Key clubs: Real Madrid have spent big to try and close the gap between themselves and defending champions Barcelona and a lot will depend on whether they can turn their potential into effective team performances. The task facing Pelligrini will be how to accommodate all of the players in his talent-laden squad, while Guardiola's problem will be how he emulates a superb first season in charge of the Blaugrana. Despite their financial woes Valencia have managed to keep hold of prize assets David Villa and David Silva. And there will be a heightened level of expectancy among the club's supporters as the club look to end their 87-year stay at Mestalla with silverware before moving to a new stadium . It also promises to be a fascinating season at Villarreal as they look to life under new coach Valverde following five seasons under Pellegrini. Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola will hope Zlatan Ibrahimovic settles into life at the Nou Camp quickly. Expert view: CNN's Pedro Pinto - ""So Real Madrid have splashed the cash, but will the massive $365 million investment translate into success on the field? That is the question football fans are asking themselves leading up to the start of the season. ""There is enough talent in Real's squad for the team to aspire to greatness. On paper, they have all the necessary elements to succeed and perhaps emulate Barcelona and their historic treble-winning season. However we all know that football is not played on paper and I personally believe Los Merengues have no chance of achieving that. ""Rome was not built in one day and neither will a treble-winning team. Ronaldo and Kaka will be fantastic this season, I have no doubt of that, while Benzema and Alonso have made the side stronger, but Real can only aspire to win one trophy this season. ""I think the new coach Pellegrini will struggle to find the right balance in the team and therefore the league title will probably escape them. ""As far as the Champions League is concerned, though, I would definitely rank Real in the top three sides to lift the trophy. The final will be played at the Santiago Bernabeu and everyone at the club would love to end a European drought which started back in 2002 on home turf. ""Despite all their success last season, defending Spanish and European champions Barcelona shook up their squad in the summer. Eto'o, scorer of 38 goals in all competitions last season, left for Inter Milan. In exchange for the Cameroon striker, manager Guardiola got Ibrahimovic. ""The Sweden international's goalscoring record is inferior to Eto'o but he does add a different dimension. For the first time in a long time Barca will have a tall striker who can make an impact in the air, as well as create his own chances in the area and bring others into play. ""It was a good move for the Catalans when you consider that Eto'o hardly endeared himself to the team's dressing room. He was a winner, but he was also a whiner. ""There is no question the title will be decided between Real and Barcelona, with my vote going to the defending champions, but we should watch out for Atletico Madrid. ""As far as I am concerned, this is one of the most exciting teams in European football and last season they won five of their last six games. ""With Aguero leading the way, anything is possible and I believe this is will be a big year for 'El Kun' who should edge out Messi as the one to watch. From what I have seen in preseason, he is going to set the league on fire! Shame their defense is a bit shaky, although they signed Spain international Juanito from Betis. ""Overall I expect Barcelona to take the title -- the backbone of the team remains intact and the chemistry in the team is fantastic. They will have to dig deep to beat Real Madrid, but my hunch is that they will be able to do it. At the wrong end of La Liga, Getafe, Xerez and Tenerife will all do well to avoid the drop.""","Real Madrid have spent $365 million on new players to try and win La Liga .

"(CNN) -- Paolo Guerrero scored twice as Hamburg took over top spot in the German Bundesliga on goal difference from Bayer Leverkusen after a 3-1 victory against bottom club Cologne on Sunday. Paolo Guerrero celebrates after scoring his second goal for Hamburg in the win over Cologne. Leverkusen had gone three points clear on Saturday night with a 2-1 win against Bochum. Peru striker Guerrero netted the opening goal against visiting Cologne after being picked out by David Jarolim in the 19th minute. Bruno Labbadia's Hamburg team needed until the 66th minute before doubling the lead, with Guerrero again giving goalkeeper Faryd Mondragon no chance. However, winless Cologne pulled one back with a spectacular long-range effort from substitute Adil Chihi before Piotr Trochowski's late penalty wrapped up the points following a foul by Mondragon on midfielder Ze Roberto. Earlier on Sunday, Werder Bremen moved up to third on goal difference following a 3-2 win at struggling Hertha Berlin. Bremen joined Schalke and Borussia Monchengladbach on seven points after all five goals were scored in just over half an hour in the second period. Bremen midfielder Mesut Ozil squandered the best chance of the first half when he hit the post with just goalkeeper Jaroslav Drobny to beat, but made amends when he broke the deadlock from a similar situation 12 minutes after the interval. Tim Borowski doubled the lead on 74 after Drobny failed to hold a shot from Torsten Frings, then the hosts pulled one back with a 20-yard free-kick from Lukasz Piszczek. Naldo made it 3-1 with seven minutes to go when he headed home from a corner before Patrik Ebert smashed in a brilliant late long-range effort to set up a tense finish.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Hundreds of excited music fans wait in line on the lookout for their favorite singers on a hit television show. Elaha Sorur was the lone female finalist on this season's ""Afghan Star,"" the country's answer to ""American Idol."" Instead of spending the time outside a New York venue or Hollywood soundstage though, these fans braved barbed wire and gun-toting guards in Kabul to attend Afghanistan's premier pop music event: the finals of ""Afghan Star,"" the embattled country's answer to ""American Idol."" In line, bright mod outfits have replaced Kabul's normally conservative dress code. Onstage, men sport the latest styles. And on TV screens, a country's new battle between traditional and pop culture plays out. ""For the young generation,"" says one fan in line, ""it's very important to be cool, with a cool mind."" Inside the concert hall, Jahid Mohseni, a 38-year-old Afghan-Australian media mogul, tries to manage the chaos he's created. Singers, child acrobats and TV technicians all compete to get his attention before the start of Afghanistan's biggest night of television. Mohseni, who started the country's top television network, Tolo TV, said he's just trying to revive Afghan culture after the fallow Taliban era when music and television were banned.  Watch performances on ""Afghan Star"" Â» . ""Yes, we are promoting social change, but we cannot push Afghan society where it doesn't want to go. This is a commercial enterprise, and it's reflecting what people want,"" Mohseni said. In Afghanistan, more than 60 percent of the population is younger than 25, and judging by the popularity of ""Afghan Star,"" ""they're like people everywhere. They're not from Mars,"" Mohseni said. At the fourth-season finals this year, the audience included those who sat quietly as well as those who loudly cheered for contestants, including Naweed Forugh (who would be named the ""Afghan Star"" winner), Naweed Sabirpur, Mehran Gulzar and Elaha Sorur, the lone female finalist. ""Art is in the blood of Afghans and has been for centuries, and it is still,"" Sorur said. ""During the years of fighting, the people haven't been able to use their artistry, but with time, it will get better and better. Afghanistan and the people of Afghanistan are ready for a change."" But not everyone is happy with Mohseni's programming choices. Afghanistan's guardians of Islamic values, the Ulema Council, protested that ""Afghan Star"" and Tolo TV's popular Indian soap operas were not part of Afghan culture. Afghanistan's minister for information and culture even tried to stop the soap operas in court, claiming that it was a question of national security. And last year, a female finalist on ""Afghan Star"" received death threats and was forced into hiding after her head scarf fell to her shoulders during a performance. ""This young woman, beautiful, dancing with her hair free ... that symbolizes everything that is forbidden and was forbidden in Afghan culture,"" said Havana Marking, director of a documentary about the show's 2008 season, also called ""Afghan Star."" Mohseni points out that Afghanistan is near two powerful neighbors: India, with a population of 1.1 billion, and Iran, with almost 70 million people (compared with Afghanistan's estimated 34 million). ""You just have to sit down with your critics and explain that if we don't have Afghan music and entertainment, Bollywood will take over,"" he said. ""We're just trying to hold our own in the middle of what is effectively a cultural war."" That culture war can be seen on Tolo TV. After meeting with the Ulema Council, Mohseni dreamed up another reality show called ""Tartil,"" or ""Koran Star."" The three finalists were quizzed by religious authorities and judged on how well they've memorized passages from the Quran, Islam's holy book. There were no wild ovations when the winner was announced. But the finale still produced a bombshell: a shy 16-year-old schoolgirl named Uzra Mohamedi, who accepted the oversize $3,500 check without cracking a smile and dressed in a traditional black veil. Other TV programming in Afghanistan includes state-run news and lifestyle shows, a popular locally produced drama about an extended Afghan family, a sketch comedy show -- and the hit Kiefer Sutherland drama ""24."" Mohseni said that ""Afghan Star"" pushes his country forward in subtle ways, for instance teaching a few valuable lessons in democracy. Winners are picked by fans who can vote on their mobile phones -- one SIM card, one vote. In previous elimination rounds, losers sometimes stormed off the set, refusing to accept defeat. But now they thank their supporters and graciously congratulate the winners. ""This is the educational component of our show, and hopefully it'll rub off on our politicians,"" Mohseni said. To coincide with Afghanistan's presidential elections in August, Mohseni created a reality show called ""The Candidate"" as a way to encourage a more robust political debate. Six young Afghans face off in mock presidential debates and compete in American-style election campaigns. In the future, Mohseni said he hopes the direction of Afghan culture will be decided democratically without traditionalists imposing values by force or government edicts. Either way, Tolo TV has an avid audience: According to Mohseni, the finals of both ""Afghan Star"" and ""Koran Star"" won their nights' ratings races, easily beating the competition.","""Afghan Star"" is Afghanistan's version of ""American Idol""

"(CNN) -- England midfielder Michael Carrick missed a first-half penalty as English Premier League champions Manchester United suffered a sensational 1-0 defeat at newly promoted Burnley. Michael Carrick misses his first-half penalty as Manchester United slumped to a stunning defeat at Burnley. The home side scored the only goal of the game in the 19th minute when Stephen Jordan's deep cross for Martin Paterson was headed away by United full-back Patrice Evra -- only for Robbie Blake to meet the ball on the volley and fire a spectacular shot into the top corner. United pressed hard for an equalizer and wasted a golden opportunity just before the end of the half when Blake turned from hero to villian by tripping Evra in the penalty area. Carrick stepped up to take the spot-kick, but goalkeeper Brian Jensen pulled off a fine save. Although United continued to dominate possession and chances after the interval, Burnley held off their illustrious opponents to secure a narrow victory in their first home match back in the top flight after an absence of 33 years. ""The goal was a fantastic strike and I think Burnley won the match with their play in the opening 10 minutes. Saying that, we had enough chances to have got something from the game,"" United manager Sir Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports. ""This is a bad blow for us.

In the night's other matches, Liverpool gave the perfect response to Sunday's defeat at Tottenham as Rafael Benitez's team thumped Stoke 4-0. Fernando Torres opened the scoring in just the fourth minute when he met Steven Gerrard's cross with a fine finish. The home side doubled their lead on the stroke of half-time when James Beattie cleared Dirk Kuyt's header off the line and the ball fell for full-back Glen Johnson, who volleyed home from close-range. Dutchman Kuyt added the third in the 78th minute from close-range while substitute David Ngog added a fourth goal in stoppage time. Tottenham made it two wins out of two with a thumping 5-1 victory at Hull City, a result that takes Harry Redknapp's side top of the table above London rivals Chelsea on goal difference. England striker Jermain Defoe, who scored twice against the Netherlands last week, maintained his superb recent form with a hat-trick, as Hull slumped to their second successive defeat. Defoe scored a 10th-minute opener when he took Tom Huddlestone's pass on the edge of the penalty area and worked space to drive home a fine finish. Honduran midfielder Wilson Palacios increased Tottenham's lead four minutes later when he finished Robbie Keane's pass for his first goal in English football. Hull winger Steven Hunt, who also scored on his debut at Chelsea on Saturday, reduced the deficit when he curled in a long-range free-kick in the 25th minute. But Defoe restored Tottenham's two-goal advantage on the stroke of half-time when he collected Keane's flick and blasted past goalkeeper Boaz Myhill.

"Havana. Cuba (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama has been issued an unexpected invitation to visit Cuba -- from the island's 90-year-old prima ballerina, who implored him to bring along five Cuban agents imprisoned in the United States for more than a decade. ""I want to invite the president of the United States to come to Cuba with his wife and lovely children,"" Alicia Alonso said at an event to call for the release of the agents, who were convicted of spying on Cuban exile groups in a hotly debated trial. ""I would ask a favor also. Please, to make everyone happy and to feel happy with all around the world, bring those five Cubans,"" Alonso said in English. White House officials contacted Wednesday morning said they were not aware that any such invitation had been received. The Cubans, known at home as ""the five heroes,"" were sent to Miami to infiltrate violent exile groups at a time when anti-Castro groups were bombing Cuban hotels. They were arrested in 1998. The invitation caps off a week-long international campaign with Hollywood stars such as Sean Penn and Danny Glover calling on Obama to step in and release the five. Last year, the defendants lost their last chance of an appeal when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear their case. The defense argued it was impossible for the men to get a fair trial in a city dominated by anti-Castro politics. Three of the men were handed life sentences in 2001 for allegedly helping Cuba shoot down two unarmed airplanes that were dropping leaflets over the island, killing the Cuban-American pilots. After Cuba began its biggest release of political prisoners in a decade, pro-Cuba activists stepped up pressure on Obama to respond by releasing the five Cubans.","Cuban prima ballerina invites Obama to come .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich closed to within two points of Bundesliga leaders Hamburg and Bayer Leverkusen with a 2-1 victory at home to Bavarian rivals Nuremberg on Saturday. Belgian defender Daniel Van Buyten celebrates his winning goal for Bayern Munich. Daniel Van Buyten's 82nd-minute winner left Bayern on 13 points behind the two top teams, who are in action on Sunday, and above Hoffenheim and Mainz on goal difference. Mainz won 3-2 away to Bochum on Saturday, while Hoffenheim scored three late goals to snatch a 4-2 victory at Borussia Moenchengladbach. They moved above Schalke, who lost 2-1 to coach Felix Magath's former team, defending champions Wolfsburg, on Friday night. Bayern broke into the top three for the first time this season despite again starting with France star Franck Ribery on the substitutes' bench, where he was joined by Miroslav Klose as young striker Thomas Muller was given the chance to add to his run of four goals in two games. Nuremberg fielded a defensive line-up, but striker Mario Gomez still managed to hit the crossbar for Bayern before Ivica Olic broke the deadlock in the 55th minute. The Croatia forward scored his second goal of the season after being fed in the penalty area by Muller, who was earlier denied one-on-one by goalkeeper Raphael Schafer. The visitors shocked the 69,000-strong crowd in the 73rd minute when Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting equalized after good work by 18-year-old midfielder Ilkay Gundogan. However, Belgian defender Van Buyten followed up his midweek Champions League goal in the win over Maccabi Haifa by heading Arjen Robben's right-wing cross into the far corner to help launch the city's Oktoberfest in fine style. Hoffenheim moved into fourth place on 11 points as Senegalese striker Demba Ba scored in the first minute of injury-time to seal victory over Moenchengladbach. Brazilian midfielder Maicosuel had equalized in the 86th minute and then Nigerian forward Chinedu Obasi put the visitors ahead three minutes later. The hosts had led 2-0 after 17 minutes through Juan Arango and Roberto Colautti, but Sejad Salihovic's free-kick beat goalkeeper Logan Bailly from an impossibly tight angle four minutes later to reduce the deficit. Mainz earned victory at Bochum thanks to a second-half double from 18-year-old striker Andre Schuerle. Midfielder Mimoun Azaouagh put the home side ahead after only seven minutes and striker Diego Fernando Klimowicz doubled the lead at the end of first-half regulation time -- but Andreas Ivanschitz reduced the deficit before the whistle blew for the interval. Schuerle netted in the 52nd and 71st minutes to give Mainz a third win from six league outings. Cologne moved off the bottom of the table with their first victory, winning 2-0 at Stuttgart with a 25th-minute header from Sebastian Freis before goalkeeper Jens Lehmann's 89th-minute error let in striker Manasseh Ishiaku. In Saturday's other game, Hannover were held 1-1 at home by Borussia Dortmund as Didier Ya Konan scored three minutes after halftime for the hosts to cancel out Nuri Sahin's goal just before the break. On Sunday, Hamburg travel to Eintracht Frankfurt, Leverkusen host Werder Bremen and bottom club Hertha Berlin are at home to Freiburg. On Friday, striker Edin Dzeko scored twice to haunt his former mentor Magath as champions Wolfsburg moved onto nine points with a third win of the Bundesliga season. The Bosnian broke the deadlock in the 55th minute with a header from Sascha Riether's cross, but Benedikt Howedes leveled with a header of his own 10 minutes from time from Levan Kenia's corner. However, Dzeko relieved the pressure on coach Armin Veh a minute later to end a run of three defeats as he fired home from eight yards after being set up by substitute Makoto Hasebe. Schalke substitute Kevin Kuranyi had a late header blocked on the line by goalkeeper Andre Lenz, filling in for the suspended Diego Benaglio.","Bayern Munich close to within two points of Bundesliga's top two teams .

"(CNN) -- Sixth seed Juan Martin Del Potro, in his first Grand Slam final, stunned defending champion and top seed Roger Federer to take the men's singles title at the U.S. Open in New York. Juan Martin Del Potro celebrates after beating Roger Federer during the final on Monday. The 20-year-old Argentinean took the Swiss world No. 1 to five sets, including two tiebreakers that went Del Potro's way, winning 3-6 7-6 (7-5) 4-6 7-6 (7-4) 6-2. Del Potro's win, which took four hours and six minutes, ended Federer's five-year reign at the U.S. Open. Federer, 28, was seeking his sixth consecutive U.S. Open win, which would have equaled the feat achieved in 1925 by American Bill Tilden, who then went on to claim his seventh U.S. Open title in 1929. Federer had already won this year's French Open and Wimbledon titles and was Australian Open runner-up. Federer claimed the opening set after leading 3-0 at the beginning, and he achieved an early break in the opening game of the second set as well. However, Del Potro broke back when Federer was serving for the second set at 5-4 up, with the set eventually going to a tie-break. Federer had never lost a tiebreak in a U.S. Open final, winning his four previous ones, but Del Potro ended that sequence by taking the tie-break 7-5 to tie the scores. The third set included a failed challenge by Del Potro, an angry response by Federer to the chair umpire, and a couple double-faults by the Argentine to give the Swiss the set. Del Potro returned to form in the fourth set that saw Federer near victory but not attain it as his young opponent again won the tiebreak. Del Potro sped to a 5-2 lead in the fifth set on his serve, and the next game went to deuce before Federer double-faulted and then overshot a backhand to concede the title. Del Potro won more points than Federer, who had 11 double-faults as well as 13 aces. Del Potro, a quarterfinalist last year, had reached the finals after beating 16th seed Marin Cilic of Croatia in the quarterfinals and then crushing third seed Rafael Nadal of Spain in the semifinals. After defeating Nadal, Del Potro had then called the victory ""the best moment of my life.""","Argentinean takes champion to five sets, winning 3-6 7-6 (7-5) 4-6 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer exclusively told CNN that the stunning shot he executed in his U.S. Open semifinal against Novak Djokovic was the best of his career. Roger Federer hailed his stunning shot against Novak Djokovic as the best of his career. The world number one produced a near-faultless performance to defeat fourth seed Djokovic in straight sets to reach his sixth consecutive U.S. Open Final at Flushing Meadows, but it was an outrageous shot to set up match point that will be most remembered. It came with Djokovic serving at 6-5 down in the third set. At love 30-0 up Federer dashed back to the baseline and hit a winner through his legs that flew over the net and past Djokovic into the corner for match point. ""I think it was the greatest shot I have ever hit in my life,"" Federer told CNN. ""I have hit some good ones over all the matches I have played, but I think this one, especially under the circumstances at love 30-up and with having chance to maybe clinch the match, was amazing. ""I got a standing ovation and people went crazy -- here in New York the crowds are fantastic -- as it was the perfect shot to hit, at exactly the right time, and I can't believe I pulled it off."" Federer also revealed he is producing his best tennis because he is under less pressure than perhaps he was at the same time last year. At this stage in 2008 Federer had not won a grand slam but after winning the French Open and a historic 15th major at Wimbledon this time round he admitted he is more relaxed. ""I have a little bit less pressure to prove myself after reaching the 15 Grand Slams everyone was talking about and I also I won in Paris,"" he added. ""Getting through the pregnancy with my wife Mirka and having two beautiful daughters is also something that relaxes you for sure. But at the same time when you walk out on center court there will always be a certain type of pressure which will be there for the rest of my career. ""I just have to make sure I handle it correctly. I always play my best tennis towards the end of a tournament and I am happy that it is continued in this match after everything that has already happened this year."" Federer will play Argentina's Juan Del Potro who reached his first grand slam final after he crushed Rafael Nadal in the other semifinal. The sixth seed blew Nadal away at the Arthur Ashe Stadium, taking two hours and 20 minutes to take a comprehensive 6-2 6-2 6-2 victory.","Roger Federer hailed a shot against Novak Djokovic as the best of his career .

"(CNN) -- Premier League big-spenders Manchester City will renew their search for a new world-class striker after ending their interest in Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o. Eto'o will not be playing for Manchester City next season after the English club ended their interest in him. The Cameroon international, who is about to embark on the last year of his contract at the Nou Camp, felt he should receive a significant portion of the Â£18million ($29m) fee City were willing to pay -- as he would be entitled to leave for nothing next summer. City manager Mark Hughes initially signalled his intention to wait for Eto'o to resolve the wrangle. Yet, as the week has dragged on, the argument has just got more confusing and complicated. Latest transfer rumors and gossip . It was suggested City were ready to offer Eto'o a deadline of this weekend to determine his future. However, in the end, City chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak did not even give the 28-year-old that long, with Barcelona officially contacted on Friday with confirmation the deal was off. ""Samuel Eto'o is undoubtedly a fine footballer but the circumstances surrounding him were such that the deal could not be completed,"" City chief executive Garry Cook told the club's official Web site. ""We now feel the time is right to pursue other avenues. We have a clear strategic transfer plan, which we continue to follow."" England midfielder Gareth Barry and Paraguayan striker Roque Santa Cruz have already joined the club this summer and Argentine forward Carlos Tevez is expected to complete his move from rivals Manchester United in the near future. Chelsea and England captain John Terry and Everton defender Joleon Lescott also remain high on the club's wish-list. Meanwhile, two players leaving the club are midfielder Gelson Fernandes and Brazilian striker Jo. Swiss international Fernandes has completed his move to French side St Etienne, while Jo has returned to Everton on loan for the season.

"(CNN) -- Lukas Podolski scored his first goal since returning to Cologne but it was not enough as they crashed to a defeat 2-1 against Schalke which leaves them bottom of the German Bundesliga. Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.","Lukas Podolski scores his first goal since returning to Cologne in 2-1 defeat .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal forward Robin van Persie has accused former teammate Emmanuel Adebayor of deliberately trying to injure him with a stamp during their English Premier League defeat to Manchester City. Robin van Persie has accused Emmanuel Adebayor of trying to deliberately injure him. Adebayor, who left Arsenal for City in July for a fee in the region of $40 million, seemed to lunge at the Dutch international who sustained a cut on the side of his head which required treatment. Match referee Mark Clattenburg did not get a clear view of the incident in a match which City won 4-2 at Eastlands and Adebayor escaped punishment following the van Persie incident, although he was booked for his goal celebration in front of the Arsenal fans after he ran the full length of the pitch. Football Association chief executive Ian Watmore has confirmed the governing body will take a ""good close look"" at the two incidents involving Adebayor who scored in the 80th minute. But van Persie directed his ire towards Togo international Adebayor, who spent three-and-a-half years at the Emirates Stadium before his move to City, with a statement on the official Arsenal Web site. Do you think the FA should punish Adebayor for his conduct? Sound Off below . ""I am sad and disappointed by my former team-mate Emmanuel Adebayor's mindless and malicious stamp on me,"" van Persie said. ""He set out to hurt me and I feel lucky that I have not suffered a greater injury. The contact was only centimeters from my eye. We are both professional footballers and I know that the game is physical. I, too, have made hard and sometimes mis-timed challenges but never with the intention of hurting an opponent. He set out to hurt me today. ""I knew he was aiming for a collision because he changed the angle of his body to allow contact to be made. He moved backwards when his natural momentum would have taken him forward. I find that deeply disrespectful. He has shown a real lack of class today, to me and the fans. ""I do feel lucky that I have not received a greater injury. The contact was only centimeters from my eye. I have not received an apology from him, there were no words exchanged afterwards. He had his own agenda today and that is bad for football. It's bad for the game we all love. ""I want to make it clear that this has nothing to do with the result of today's match. We do not hide from that disappointment but I need to speak out about this behavior."" Adebayor later apologized for his goal celebration in front of the Arsenal supporters as it later emerged that a match steward needed hospital treatment after being hit by a flying object in the wake of the reaction by the Gunners fans. City manager Mark Hughes called for the authorities not to come down too hard on the 25-year-old Togo international for the celebration. ""We have to cut Emmanuel a bit of slack -- he is an emotional guy and was caught up in the moment. It was a fantastic goal and great finish,"" Hughes told the club's Web site. ""He has already apologized on camera and that is the right thing to do because obviously it can be provocative. ""We just have to understand that he is an emotional guy and he wanted to share the moment with the fans in the corner with whom he has a special affinity.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- There is a mathematical reason why the French Open is so different to any other of the Grand Slam tennis tournaments. Clay courts require a different type of game to grass and hard court surfaces . The Roland Garros tournament is currently being contested, with Rafael Nadal looking for his fifth win in a row, and world number two Roger Federer searching for his first ever French Open title. â¢ Get the latest French Open news . What has brought problems to Federer, and to other greats like Pete Sampras and Boris Becker -- who never won a French Open, is the clay surface on which it is contested. The maths of the clay surface are distinctly different to grass or hard-court surfaces. All officially recognized courts have a court pace rating (CPR), which rates the ""speed"" of the court -- and clay courts are at the bottom. The crushed-brick mixture that constitutes the base of a clay court produces a the highest bounce and most friction of the three surfaces, meaning they have the lowest CPR of all three surface types and are considered as the ""slowest"". Grass courts are generally have the highest CPR numbers, and are the ""fastest"" courts. The CPR numbers give a hint as to whether a ball will bounce higher or lower on a specific surface, and how much friction there is to either slow the ball or allow it to skid on. An example court pace rating for each surface may be 23 for a clay court, 35 for a hard court and 46 for a grass court. â¢ Try our special interactive to see how tennis ball bounce on different surfaces Â» . This number is calculated by considering both horizontal speed and vertical bounce of a tennis ball off a court. The equation used is CPR = SPR + 150 x (0.81-e). To make more sense of this, the International Tennis Federation, the game's law-makers, have produced a chart which simply matches the coefficient of friction (friction) and coefficient of restitution (bounce) to produce a court pace rating. But it's not just the bounce and speed of the ball off the clay surface that sets it apart from other courts, and makes the French Open an elusive tournament for some players. Head of women's tennis at Britain's Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), Nigel Sears, told CNN the slippery nature of the clay surface also set it apart from other types of court. ""The main factor that makes it different is that it's a loose surface. That allows players to slide on it."" The loose surface and different clay characteristics meant the crushed-brick surface required a different game plan, he said. ""Players are a lot further back on the clay surface. If you look at Nadal, his return of service points of contact are different to other surfaces ... on clay he can sit back."" The slower pace and higher bounce also meant big servers like Sampras were negated on clay and certain types of players were better suited to it, Sears said. ""Clay magnifies spin. So the slice is effective on clay ... and you can also produce a lot of top spin. One of the problems Federer has on clay is that he has a single-handed backhand, and Nadal can get so much spin -- so Federer is trying to hit single-handed shots up around his shoulder."" The clay approach was slightly different in women's tennis, however, as some players tended to approach clay matches similar to hard-court games, he said. Sears said endurance was also a crucial advantage on clay, particularly at Roland Garros. ""You tend to have longer rallies on clay. The French Open is so physical with five-set matches. When somebody faces Nadal to five sets no-one can compete with him physically,"" he said.","Clay, grass and hard tennis court surfaces all produce different bounces .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- If Manchester United and Liverpool fans are expecting the arrival of superstar players ahead of the new season then they had better think again, as the cost of refinancing debt could significantly curb the club's spending power according to industry experts. Liverpool co-owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks took over the club in February 2007 . Financial prudence will be the watchword for the majority of the English Premier League in the transfer market as clubs look to consolidate their financial position in a move that could see a shift of power in Europe to Spain's La Liga. United have received $130 million for the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid, but the Glazer family owners will not sanction anywhere near that amount for new players according to Professor Rogan Taylor at the University of Liverpool's Football Industry Group. The Americans' takeover of the Red Devils placed the club in $1,100m of debt, according to the holding companies' accounts of 2009; a situation that requires careful management. ""The refinancing at Manchester United is structured in a very complex way but ultimately the economic difficulties now mean that there will be a reduction in Alex Ferguson's transfer budget,"" he told CNN. ""Although some of the funds from the Ronaldo transfer will go back into the club's coffers there will be a tightening of the purse strings which will seriously impact on United's capacity to go after the top players. ""Certainly, Ferguson would have wanted a top-class replacement for Ronaldo but with the need to keep the debt in order and -- being unable to compete with Real Madrid and Manchester City -- the funds available and the pool of players from which they can sign is a lot smaller.""  Liverpool's situation is even more acute as American co-owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks, through their company Kop Holdings, struggle to secure the finances to fund the club's proposed new stadium. A deal to refinance their $570m Royal Bank of Scotland loan appears to have been secured, but the long-term sustainability of the idea used to purchase Liverpool is serious under question.  Will Liverpool and Manchester United splash the cash in the transfer market despite the financial problems? Who would you like to see them sign? Let us know your comments in the 'Sound off' box below. Professor Taylor added: ""The whole model on which Hicks and Gillett bought Liverpool is flawed and Rafael Benitez may have to sell Javier Mascherano or Xabi Alonso before he can go out and spend during the close season. ""Even then there is no certainty he will get the whole amount from the sale of either of those players back in the transfer kitty so it promises to be a difficult period for Liverpool as obviously expectation has been raised following last season's second-place finish. ""The need to refinance the debt remains key to the American owners remaining in control of the club so that will be their priority -- at the expense of matters on the pitch."" Jon Keen deputy chairman of the Football Supporters Federation, and an expert in the field of club governance and ownership, admitted the situation at both clubs will stir up further resentment among fans towards their owners. ""The current refinancing situation in the top-flight is like a financial house cards which could come crashing down at any time,"" he told CNN. ""We have already seen a situation unravel with the banking system which has angered a lot of people and something similar could well happen with football in the near future. ""Ultimately fans want to see money raised from sales of players either put back into the transfer pot or levied against their own costs of attending matches, not simply servicing huge amounts of debt as is the case with Manchester United and Liverpool at the moment. ""There needs to be a reality check about the way these clubs are operating. Certainly, I think the current economic climate will drastically reduce the spending power of clubs in the Premier League with the exception perhaps of Manchester City."" Of course, this contrasts with Spain's Real Madrid who have recently splashed almost $300m on Ronaldo, Kaka and Karim Benzema -- and are not finished yet if president Florentino Perez is to be believed. The construction magnate and his powerful board are able to wield influence with banks and allow Real to secure credit on favorable terms which, combined with a lucrative domestic television rights deal, puts them in a stronger financial position. Ultimately this appears to have precipitated a shift away from the English Premier League to La Liga for the world's best players as Spain becomes the preferred destination of choice. Whether Real can convert this into a challenge to the recent English domination of the UEFA Champions League on the pitch remains to be seen.","Refinancing has left Manchester United and Liverpool short of transfer funds .

"(CNN)  -- Five-time defending champion Roger Federer is bidding to match the record of a controversial tennis legend who dominated the sport in the 1920s but died in disgrace. Tilden dominated tennis in the 1920s with his own trademark style. American Bill Tilden achieved fame and fortune through his tennis exploits and befriended Hollwyood stars such as Charle Chaplin, but he spent over a year in jail in the 1940s on a morals charge, which ruined his reputation before his untimely death in 1953. Tilden won his six straight U.S. Open titles from 1920-1925 - a record since the tournament abolished the challenge system - where the champion automatically qualified for the final - in 1911. Under that system, Richard Sears won the first seven editions of the U.S. Open (then the U.S. National Tennis Championships) in the 1880s. Tilden, who claimed his seventh U.S .Open title in 1929 as well as being twice a losing finalist, goes down in the history books as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. A relatively late starter, Tilden struggled to get into his college tennis team in Pennsylvania, but years of dedicated practice started to bear fruit after the First World War as he reached the U.S. Open finals of 1918 and 1919. He reached his peak in the 1920s, winning his first U.S. Open title and holding the world number one spot for seven straight years. Tilden also led the United States to a record seven straight Davis Cup titles as well as claiming three Wimbledon titles. His famed ""cannonball"" services worked particularly well on the fast grass surfaces on which the U.S. Open and Wimbledon were staged. Tilden never won the French Open being losing finalist in the last year it was held on grass courts, in 1927, and 1930 on clay. He won the last of his 10 grand slam titles at Wimbledon in 1930 before deserting the amateur ranks for the fledging professional circuit . Eventually joined by the likes of Ellsworth Vines, Fred Perry and Don Budge, Tilden remained a star attraction until well into his 40s, filling arenas such as Madison Square Garden in big money matches. But off the court, Tilden was a controversial figure, battling with tennis officials as his amateur status was called into question and being accused of being arrogant and inconsiderate. Tilden, who never married, saw his reputation destroyed in the 1940s when he was found guilty of a morals charge in connection with a minor. He served seven-and-a-half months of a year jail term but was arrested again in 1949 after picking up a 16-year-old male hitchhiker. Tilden served a further 10 months for his probation violation and was shunned by the tennis community. His friendship with Hollywood stars such as Chaplin and a love of the theatrical world saw Tilden pour much of his riches into less than successful Broadway productions.

"(CNN) -- Italian champions Inter Milan have handed a new three-year contract to veteran defender Marco Materazzi. Marco Materazzi now seems set to end his playing career with Inter Milan. The 35-year-old World Cup winner's existing deal had been due to run out at the end of next summer, but he is now set to stay at the San Siro until 2012. A statement on the Inter Web site read: ''FC Internazionale and Marco Materazzi announce the agreement for an extension which will bind the player to the club until 30 June 2012.'' The center-back has made almost 250 appearances for the Nerazzurri since joining Inter in 2001, winning four Serie A titles. However, last season he was restricted to just 15 outings under new manager Jose Mourinho. ""I'll be Inter for life,"" he wrote on his official Web site, Goal.com reported on Thursday. ""And it's not just a figure of speech. I could not have been more satisfied before leaving for my holidays -- I have extended my contract with Inter until 2012, hence until the end of my career. ""That's what I have always desired, since I am an Inter fan as much as I am one of their players. ""I will quit football wearing this shirt, and now I only want to try and win as much as we can both in Italy and in Europe. We'll see each other on July 10 for the start of the new season. I will be fired up."" Materazzi is still best known for his antics in the 2006 World Cup final, when his comments to Zinedine Zidane led to the France playmaker being sent off for a vicious headbutt in his farewell international which ended with the Italians being crowned world champions. Meanwhile, Inter have also completed the signing of Genoa midfielder Thiago Motta on a four-year contract. The 26-year-old, who resurrected his career last season after moving from Barcelona, has finalized a deal that was agreed earlier in the summer and also saw Argentine striker Diego Milito move to the San Siro on Tuesday. Inter confirmed that midfielder Francesco Bolzoni, defender Leonardo Bonucci and striker Riccardo Meggiorini will join the Grifoni on a permanent basis in an overall package including the five players worth a reported $42 million.","Marco Materazzi handed new three-year contract by Italian champions .

"(CNN) -- Carlos Tevez is wanted by clubs in Spain and Italy as well as England's Premier League should Manchester United choose to show him the door when his loan deal expires at the end of the month. Argentine striker Tevez is still hoping Manchester United will offer him a new deal at the end of the month. Argentine international striker Tevez is clearly frustrated at United manager Alex Ferguson's failure to open talks regarding a permanent transfer to the defending Champions League finalists. On Sunday Tevez ran in the direction of Ferguson and United chief executive David Gill and cupped his hands to his ears after scoring in the 2-0 win over Manchester City that left the club on the brink of another Premier League title. The 25-year-old still hopes for a positive response, but said at the weekend that he expects to leave the club at the end of his two-year loan contract . Tevez's agent Adrian Ruocco told Argentine newspaper Ole: ""He might move to Spain, Italy or stay in England. There are interested clubs from all those countries. ""He already said he would like to stay in the Premier League because he likes football in the country, so he fortunately will decide where he will play. He is lucky to have the chance to choose."" Ruocco said: ""There was no will from the directors and the coach to sign a new contract. On May 31, he will have no club and no contract. I don't know why, but Manchester (United) have not asked for any renewal (of the loan) nor signing him for next season."" He added: ""The directors and the coach do not seem to want him, while on the other hand fans love him."" However, Tevez's adviser Kia Joorabchian stressed the striker would not rush to a decision over his future before the season ends. Although a permanent move to United remains a possibility, Joorabchian is also aware of interest in the former West Ham frontman. ""There's a lot of interest in Carlos, but Carlos has always been very focused and very concentrated,"" Joorabchian told Sky Sports News. ""For the respect of the team, the manager, the club, and the fans, we have to stay focused on finishing the season on a high. ""This is how he's always been. He wants to do the best he can. He will let the season finish and then sit down and evaluate the situation."" Joorabchian indicated Tevez would ""move on and think about his own future"" if there is no movement by United to sign him permanently, with a move to another English club a desirable option. ""What he wants to do is to go to a club which has real ambition, a real focus, to be champions of England, champions of Europe, champions of everywhere,"" Joorabchian said. ""Obviously leaving United he would have to go to a rival in order to achieve that target. But he understands it's not in his control."" ""I don't want to direct, saying it's going to be Liverpool, City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Everton, Tottenham -- whoever you can pick out -- Milan, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus. ""The key is that at the present moment Carlos is a United player and he's focused on being a United player for the rest of the season.""","Carlos Tevez wanted by clubs in Spain and Italy as well as Premier League .

"Washington (CNN) -- Airline pilots who want to skip certain airport screening measures -- saying it's wasteful to search pilots for sharp objects when they can bring down planes with their bare hands -- are finally getting their way. The Transportation Security Administration announced Friday that it is taking steps to streamline screening for U.S. airline pilots. Pilots traveling in uniform on airline business will be allowed to bypass normal security screening by presenting screeners with their airline ID and another form of identification, the TSA said. The screeners will check the information against a secure, real-time airline crew member database, which includes a picture and other information to verify the pilots' employment status, the TSA said. Pilots will be subject to random screening and other layers of security, the TSA said. The TSA said the changes will take effect immediately while it phases in a more permanent system. Pilots have long argued that it is a waste of costly security resources to check pilots for restricted objects. Thousands of pilots, they note, are licensed to carry firearms in cockpits under the government's Federal Flight Deck Officer program. Time spent checking pilots would be better spent checking others, they say. ""Airline pilots are the last line of defense against someone who would use an airplane for ill. And we need to be a trusted partner in our security efforts,"" retired U.S. Airways pilot Chelsey ""Sully"" Sullenberger told CNN earlier this week. ""You know, many pilots are already armed as deputized and trained flight deck officers to defend the cockpit. And so really it's a waste of our limited resources to put airline pilots who are trusted partners in this through this screening."" TSA Administrator John Pistole said the change ""just makes for smart security and an efficient use of our resources."" The change also will likely squelch pilot complaints about going through full-body scanners, some of which emit low levels of radiation. The TSA says the scanners are safe, exposing people to about the same amount of radiation they would get by flying for about two minutes at altitude. But pilots have become alarmed by some doctors who say not enough is known about the machines. Recently, a pilots union encouraged its members to avoid the devices. On Friday, pilots unions called the announcement a welcome change. For the past three years, the TSA has tested an electronic pilot identification screening system called CrewPASS, or Crew Personnel Advanced Screening System. The TSA said Friday that CrewPASS will continue to operate at the test sites: Baltimore-Washington Thurgood Marshall International, Pittsburgh International, and Columbia (S.C.) Metropolitan airports.","Pilots will now present airline ID and another form of identification .

"(CNN) -- English Premier League leaders Chelsea smashed seven goals past hapless Sunderland on Saturday, while second-placed Manchester United kept up the pressure with a 3-0 victory at home to Burnley. Chelsea lost four key players to the Africa Cup of Nations, but showed they still have plenty of firepower following a 7-2 demolition of visiting Sunderland. England midfielder Frank Lampard scored two goals, as did France striker Nicolas Anelka on his return from injury, while Germany midfielder Michael Ballack, France winger Florent Malouda and defender Ashley Cole also netted. Coach Carlo Ancelotti was delighted as his team, missing strikers Didier Drogba and Solomon Kalou plus key midfielders Michael Essien and Jon Obi Mikel, remained one point ahead of United having played one less game than last season's champions. ""I think that was maybe the best performance this season,"" the Italian told reporters. ""We played very well until the end of the match. We started the game very well. I'm very happy because it's an important time for us. ""Without the African players we maybe could have some problems. I always said I have a fantastic squad and today other players played very well, especially Juliano Belletti in a new position for him, so it is a good moment for us."" The win was slightly tarnished by an ankle injury to England fullback Cole, whose goal was the 18,000th in Premier League history, while captain John Terry was taken off at halftime as a precaution with the Londoners already 4-0 up. Sunderland scored two consolation goals through substitute Bolo Zenden, a former Chelsea player, and prolific striker Darren Bent, but Steve Bruce's side were left in 12th place after eight league games without a win. Manchester United moved onto 44 points from 21 games after a 14th league victory this season, but Burnley's defense held out for more than an hour in new manager Brian Laws' first game in charge. Bulgaria striker Dimitar Berbatov finally broke the deadlock in the 64th minute as he atoned for several earlier misses with a clever flick for his seventh goal of the season. He was also involved in the second goal five minutes later, with England forward Wayne Rooney following up after his strike partner was denied by Burnley goalkeeper Brian Jensen. New signing Mame Biram Diouf marked his home debut with a goal at the end as he headed Antonio Valencia's cross past Jensen. United manager Alex Ferguson later revealed that Berbatov, who has been struggling with knee problems, may need to have surgery. ""He played through it today but he could have come off at half-time. We will have to look at it again on Monday and see what the situation is,"" Ferguson said. Fourth-placed Manchester City failed to close the gap on Arsenal, who travel to Bolton on Sunday, after losing 2-0 at mid-table Everton. City manager Roberto Mancini suffered his first defeat in five games since taking over from the sacked Mark Hughes. Blog: Man City take huge gamble on Mancini . South Africa midfielder Steven Pienaar scored for the second successive match with a superb free-kick in the 36th minute, while France striker Louis Saha then doubled the lead in first-half injury-time with a penalty after City defender Micah Richards was ruled to have pulled his shirt. Everton hit the woodwork twice in the second half through midfielders Marouane Fellaini and Tim Cahill as City pressed forward in search of a goal. Tottenham remained in fifth place after being held 0-0 at home by second-bottom Hull, who had goalkeeper Boaz Myhill to thank for a series of superb saves. Spurs boss Harry Redknapp, who faces court action by tax authorities next month, was left frustrated in his 500th Premier League match as a manager -- though his team equaled their club record of five consecutive clean sheets. Liverpool's under-pressure manager Rafael Benitez also suffered a disappointing end to a miserable week as his team, who were knocked out of the FA Cup by second division strugglers Reading, were held 1-1 at 10th-placed Stoke. Blog: How long can Liverpool keep faith with Rafa? The visitors, missing the injured key trio of Steven Gerrard, Fernando Torres and Yossi Benayoun, led in the 57th minute through Greece defender Sotirios Kyrgiakos' first goal for the club, but German center-back Robert Huth snatched a point for Stoke with seconds remaining. Last season's runners-up were left in seventh place on 34 points, struggling to qualify for next season's Champions League let alone mount a title challenge. Wigan moved out of the relegation zone with a 2-0 victory at fellow strugglers Wolverhampton, as both teams ended the match with 10 men. Second-half goals from new signing James McCarthy and Charles N'Zogbia came after Wolves goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann saved Hugo Rodallega's penalty. Home defender Richard Stearman and Wigan midfielder Hendry Thomas were sent off in either half.

"(CNN) -- After meeting a number black couples in crisis, Nisa Muhammad and Dr. Rozario Slack were inspired to create Basic Training for Couples. Nisa Muhammad, who founded National Black Marriage Day, co-created the Basic Training for Couples program. The eight-week program educates dating, engaged or married couples about the value of commitment, responsibility to the black community, psychological differences between the sexes, sexual intimacy and conflict resolution.  Slack created the male-friendly portion while Muhammad, who founded National Black Marriage Day and the Wedded Bliss Foundation, created the female-friendly portion. In the program, couples also learn about the history of the African-American marriage and many for the first time plot their own family tree to trace marriage and divorces.  The following is rundown of the eight-week course:  Class No. 1: Why marriage? This class teaches the benefits of marriage for men, women, children and the community. It gives the history of marriage in the black community from slavery when marriage was illegal to today's trends. Icebreaker: Q & A: How couples met? Homework: . 1. Choose songs to reflect their love for each other . 2. Marriage family tree . Class No. 2: From I to we; the sweetness of surrender . This class helps couples transition from ""I thinking"" to ""we thinking."" It helps them understand the value of making their marriage a priority in their lives. Class No. 3: Communication; getting your message understood . This class helps couples take responsibility for their communication and teaches skills to improve their communication techniques. Main lessons: . â¢ Respecting differences between men and women . â¢ Learning to talk to each other and not at each other . â¢ Format: Teaching session with dialogue. â¢ Activity: The talking stick, during conversation only the individual holding the stick can speak. Class No. 4: Conflict management . This class helps couples understand that conflict needs to be managed, or it will manage you.

Activity: Break up into gender groups to discuss current conflicts. The group works out ways to solve the issue . Class No. 5: Let's make love . When the sex is good in a marriage, it's only about 20 percent of what's going on. When it's bad, it's a significant problem. This class helps to solve some of those problems. The approach was from a physiological and biological perspective of the differences between the male's and female's body. Discussion included chemical bonding effect in women and men. Class No. 6: From yours and mine to ours . Many couples in the black community bring children from other relationships to their marriage. This class helps to blend the family into one cohesive unit.

"Editor's note: Marian Wright Edelman is president of the Children's Defense Fund, a nonprofit organization that advocates for policies to help children escape poverty, abuse and neglect and gain access to health care and education. Edelman was the first black woman admitted to the Mississippi bar and was a leader in the civil rights movement. Her latest book is ""The Sea Is So Wide And My Boat Is So Small: Charting a Course for the Next Generation."" Marian Wright Edelman says many black babies enter the world with multiple strikes against them. (CNN) -- One of the most dangerous threats facing black America right now is quietly stealing our children at a young age. Incarceration is becoming the new American apartheid, and poor children of color are the fodder. So many poor black babies in rich America enter the world with multiple strikes against them: born without prenatal care, at low birthweight and to a poor, and poorly educated, teenage single mother and an absent father. At crucial points in their development after birth through adolescence, more risks pile on, making a successful transition to productive adulthood significantly less likely and involvement in the criminal justice system significantly more likely. This is America's pipeline to prison, a trajectory that is funneling tens of thousands of youths down life paths that lead to marginalized lives, imprisonment and, often, premature death. Nationally, one in three black boys and one in 17 black girls born in 2001 is at risk of imprisonment during their lifetime. It's time to sound a loud alarm about this threat to American unity and community, act to stop the growing criminalization of children at younger and younger ages, and tackle the unjust treatment of minority youths and adults in the juvenile and adult criminal justice systems with urgency and persistence. We must reduce detention and incarceration by increasing preventive supports and services children need, including access to comprehensive child health and mental health coverage, quality early childhood development programs like Early Head Start, and supports for parents including home visitation programs. And every child has to get an education that prepares him or her to succeed in the 21st-century economy. The failure to act now will reverse the hard-earned racial and social progress for which the Rev. Martin Luther King and so many others died and sacrificed. The urgent challenge for each of us and for our nation is to prevent this waste of our children's lives and our nation's future capabilities. Who are some of the black leaders coming up with solutions for saving our children? People like Geoffrey Canada, president and CEO of the Harlem Children's Zone, who recently spoke about his work to CNN's Soledad O'Brien for the ""Black in America"" series. The Harlem Children's Zone Project is a holistic system of education, social service and community-building programs designed to help the children and families in a 97-block area of Central Harlem from birth on, from classes on baby care and child development through preschool, intensive public charter schools and after-school activities right up to job training and college success programs. The HCZ Project's two fundamental goals are to help children as early in their lives as possible and to create a critical mass of adults around them who understand what it takes to help them succeed. The evidence -- including new research on the success of HCZ's Promise Academy charter schools in closing black-white student test score achievement gaps -- shows that HCZ's comprehensive approach to saving Harlem's children is working. I applaud the Obama administration's plans to create 20 additional ""promise zones"" across the country. Connie Rice is another visionary leader working on solutions to the pipeline to prison crisis in Los Angeles and California. She is co-director of the Advancement Project, a policy, communications and legal ""action tank"" committed to racial justice. Rice is known for her unconventional approaches to tackling problems of inequity and exclusion, and she works on education, gang and violence prevention, and other serious concerns affecting the healthy development of young people. During her long career as a civil rights lawyer, including serving as co-director of the Los Angeles office of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., she won billions of dollars in policy changes and remedies, including a 1999 lawsuit that gained $750 million for school construction in Los Angeles that had been set to go to suburban school districts. Rice and her colleagues are finding innovative ways of dismantling some of the persistent structural inequalities that exist in America, and their successes help level the playing field for poor children of color. We need to celebrate, support and replicate the work of these kinds of leaders. Child poverty and neglect, racial disparities in systems that serve children, and the pipeline to prison are not acts of God. They are our nation's immoral political and economic choices that can and must be changed with strong political, corporate, community and family leadership. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marian Wright Edelman.","Marian Wright Edelman: Black youths at higher risk of going to prison .

"Washington (CNN) -- A 19-year-old Virginia teenager who says he was kidnapped and tortured by Kuwaiti authorities and placed on a ""no-fly"" list that prevented him from going home has returned to the United States and been reunited with his family. FBI agents questioned Gulet Mohamed after his plane landed at Dulles International Airport in suburban Washington early Friday, said his attorney, Gadeir Abbas. That questioning ended, and the teen was subsequently cleared through customs. Mohamed's family greeted him with balloons and a dozen roses. Mohamed's lawyers argued that as a U.S. citizen, Mohamed had a right to be in the United States, and that the government had provided no reason for including him on the no-fly list. Federal prosecutors later told a judge they were making arrangements to allow the teenager to return to the United States. Mohamed, a Muslim-American from Alexandria, Virginia, is suing the U.S. government over the alleged detention. Mohamed had been trapped in Kuwait for nearly a month, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday in federal court in Virginia. No-fly lists were set up to protect Americans against potential threats. They are designed to prevent terrorist suspects from boarding planes to and from the United States. But Abbas says in the lawsuit that the United States impeded his client's basic right to return and live freely in the country. Abbas is a staff attorney for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. ""Mohamed, who was previously prevented from boarding a flight to the United States, has alleged that he was tortured while in detention in Kuwait and has faced unconstitutional coercion to answer questions by FBI agents who ignored his repeated requests for legal representation,"" the statement also said. Mohamed's return came after a hearing Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria. Judge Anthony J. Trenga told the government that it should make arrangements to allow Mohamed to return unless it could produce evidence against him. The lawsuit says Mohamed came to the United States from Somalia with his family when he was 3, grew up in Virginia and is now a naturalized citizen. In March 2009, Mohamed's curiosity led him halfway around the world to visit relatives living overseas and to learn Arabic, according to the lawsuit. He started his journey in Sanaa, Yemen, but then moved to Somalia, where he stayed with relatives for several months. By August he was on his way to Kuwait where an uncle took him in so he could continue his Arabic studies, the suit says. Mohamed followed proper travel procedures, according to the lawsuit, renewing his visitor's visa twice during his stay in Kuwait. But when he went to Kuwait's international airport last December to get another 90-day extension, he waited several hours. The lawsuit says Mohamed wrote an e-mail to his brother in Virginia while he waited, saying the process was taking longer than usual. That was the last time anyone heard from him for a week, the suit says. According to the lawsuit, Mohamed says he was approached at the airport by two men who handcuffed and blindfolded him. They drove him to another location in an SUV. Mohamed claims he was beaten, tortured and interrogated over the next week. The lawsuit describes him being whipped, threatened with electrocution and questioned by captors who had private information about his family in the United States . They also questioned him about his relationship with Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born Muslim cleric who has close ties to al Qaeda and who is believed to be in Yemen. Mohamed's lawyer says Mohamed denies any link to al-Awlaki. Mohamed was transferred to a deportation facility in Kuwait on December 28, the lawsuit says. He used a fellow detainee's hidden cell phone and was able to contact his family and retain a CAIR attorney. According to the lawsuit, Kuwaiti officials told Mohamed's family they were holding him on behalf of the United States. His lawyers say Kuwaiti officials tried to deport Mohamed but were unable to do so because the United States had placed him on the no-fly list. A U.S. official confirmed to CNN that Mohamed is on the list, but would not explain why. U.S. State Department spokesman Philip Crowley denied Mohamed was detained at the behest of the United States. CNN's Laurie Ure contributed to this report.","NEW: Gulet Mohamed is questioned by FBI, met by family at Dulles International Airport .

"Melissa Harris-Lacewell is associate professor of politics and African-American studies at Princeton University. She is the author of the award-winning book ""Barbershops, Bibles, and BET: Everyday Talk and Black Political Thought"" and writes a daily blog titled The Kitchen Table. Melissa Harris-Lacewell says African-Americans remain skeptical about racial progress in the U.S. PRINCETON, New Jersey (CNN) -- America was proud of itself for electing Barack Obama. The pride was not just partisan and ideological; it was also specifically and clearly racial. The morning after Obama's win, The New York Times declared ""Racial Barrier Falls in Decisive Victory."" The Los Angeles Times asserted that ""for the first time in human history, a largely white nation has elected a black man to be its paramount leader."" Some black commentators openly wept on election night, thrilled with witnessing the election of our first black president. Even Sen. John McCain, conceding defeat, pointed to the greatness of the American promise fulfilled in the election of his opponent. Obama's victory offered the possibility that the scars of America's racial legacy were healed or, at least, that they were less raw. For many African-American citizens, the election of the first black U.S. president was cause for celebration and open-mouthed wonder about an outcome that seemed so unlikely just two years earlier, when Obama announced his bid. Despite this joy, many black citizens were dubious that his victory represented the destruction of any particular racial barrier. African-Americans were both proud of and excited about Obama, but in the 45 years since the passage of the Civil Rights Act, black Americans had seen doors to power, influence and wealth open just enough to admit just a few without fundamentally altering opportunities for the majority. Indeed, responses to a recent CNN/Essence Magazine/Opinion Research Corp. survey indicate that black enthusiasm about Obama exists side-by-by side with deep skepticism about America's racial progress. This atmosphere of both enthusiasm and doubt has sparked discussion about whether we have entered a post-racial era in American politics. It is a difficult debate, because the term ""post-racial"" is not clearly defined. Race itself is a slippery idea. Typically, we treat race like a fixed, unchanging, biological category. But race is none of these things. Race is a social construct. Though it is based in physical traits, race is a category developed through social practice, law and history. As a nation, we made blackness through our politics, developing a category of people who could be enslaved and later segregated. So when we talk of a post-racial America, we are not pointing to the massive demographic shifts that are unalterably changing the racial, ethnic and linguistic landscape of America. Instead, ""post-racial"" is an expression of social and political longing. For most, this means an America free of racism and discrimination, but others seem to hint at a society entirely free of racial identity or recognition. The idea of a post-racial America has been upheld as an achievable ideal where people would receive equal treatment and fair outcomes regardless of their race. It has been critiqued as an impossible dream unlikely to exist in a nation with a history of slavery and legal discrimination. It has been denounced as an unworthy goal that would require black Americans to reject their cultural specificity and unique social and political concerns. Undoubtedly, the 2008 election broke formerly entrenched racial trends. Obama was elected just as the depth and breadth of the American economic crisis was becoming clear. Some suggested that his victory could be explained by the nation's fiscal difficulties because he was the candidate of the out-party, which often wins when times are hard. But this analysis forgets the cross-cutting history of race. When the economic pie shrinks, Americans rarely form multiracial political coalitions led by minority candidates. Obama's victory countered the trend toward racial balkanization more typical in tough economic times. The changing dynamics of racial politics were further evidenced when Obama won both Virginia and North Carolina. In these Southern states and in many blue states throughout the country, Obama shattered the ""Bradley Effect,"" often getting a higher percentage of the white vote than polls predicted. There was little evidence that white voters rejected Obama based on his race, and few white Democrats crossed party lines to vote for McCain. For these reasons, Obama's win offers evidence of a post-racial American electoral politics. And if not post-racial, these data at least point to a much less racist American voting public than what existed 40 years ago. Still, the election of a black president has not changed the material realities of racial inequality. African-Americans are significantly more distressed than their white counterparts on every meaningful economic indicator: income, unemployment, wealth, education, home ownership and home foreclosures. African-American social realities are equally grim. Blacks are far more likely to be arrested and more harshly sentenced than whites. African-Americans are less likely to marry, more likely to divorce and more likely to live in single- parent households. Compared with whites, blacks are more likely to suffer infant mortality, cancer, diabetes and premature death. Substantial evidence shows that the economic, social and even political gains made by African-Americans in the 1960s and 1970s have leveled off or reversed in the past decade in areas such as urban education, the number of black elected officials and the racial wealth gap. The murder of a security guard at the national Holocaust museum by a racist anti-Semite reminded the nation that old-fashioned, violent bigotry still has life in America. These sobering realities indicate that race still vastly over-determines the life chances of Americans. These differences cannot be explained away by class alone, because most of these inequalities persist even when controlling for income. To be born black in America is still a tremendous disadvantage compared with being born white in this country. Herein lies the challenge facing Americans in this new racial era. For much of the 20th century, the battle for civil rights rested on a belief that political equality would translate into social and economic justice. There can be little doubt that many of the substantive battles for political power and representation have been won. In that sense, Obama's election is the fulfillment of a post-racial political promise. It is equally clear that this political arrival has not ushered in the other substantive racial changes that the civil rights movement hoped to achieve. In many ways, political equality is just the beginning of the process. The work of politics is to collectively craft the nation we want to have. The election of Obama does not indicate the realization of post-racial America, but it does allow us the opportunity to engage in renewed, collective questioning of what a racially just nation is like. Having achieved so much politically, there is still real debate about how to end overt racism, structural discrimination and persistent inequality. Some want a country where the black kids don't sit together in the cafeteria, while others hope black kids being together will provoke neither comment nor anxiety. Some want a nation where no one notices race, while others hope that their racial identity can be both recognized and appreciated. Some worry that eliminating racial barriers will only solidify economic differences, while others suspect that economic justice cannot be achieved without grappling with race. Some want the end of all inequality, while others simply hope disparities will be based on ""merit"" rather than race. As citizens in a democracy, we can choose the future of our racial politics. Not all at once and not without struggle, but we can make new choices . And this time, African-Americans participate in the process of remaking America's racial story from a very different position than we have occupied in the past. Rather than being solely on the margins of national power, black Americans, through the person of Obama, have achieved a new kind of citizenship more empowered to recreate American race. This does not mean black people have equal political or economic power, but it does mean that the election of Obama encourages black Americans to even more loudly and clearly articulate our varied aspirations for our country. In November, we did a marvelous thing. Now, the work begins.

"POTTSVILLE, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- A fomer Pennsylvania high school football player  was acquitted of murder Friday in the beating death of a Mexican immigrant last summer. Luis Ramirez died of blunt force injuries after a confrontation with a group of Pennsylania teens. However, a Schuylkill County jury found Brandon Piekarsky and Derrick Donchak guilty of simple assault stemming from the death of Luis Ramirez, who died of blunt force injuries to the head after a fight with the defendants and their friends. Donchak, 19, was also found guilty of providing alcohol to the group of teens that encountered Ramirez the night of July 12 on a residential street in the rural mining town of Shenandoah. Both teens were acquitted of ethnic intimidation charges. Prosecutors alleged the teens baited the undocumented Mexican immigrant into a fight with racial epithets, provoking an exchange of punches and kicks that ended with Ramirez convulsing in the street, foaming from the mouth. He died two days later in a hospital in Danville. Piekarsky, 17, had faced a charge of third-degree murder for allegedly delivering a fatal kick to Ramirez's head after he was knocked to the ground. He also was found not guilty of ethnic intimidation, aggravated assault and attempting to solicit a cover-up. An all-white jury of six men and six women heard from several prosecution witnesses, including a juvenile co-defendant and another teen who pleaded guilty in federal court for his role in the fight. While the jury heard conflicting accounts about who initiated the encounter or delivered the final kick to Ramirez's head, defense lawyers attempted to place the blame on another co-defendant, who is facing charges in juvenile court, and Colin Walsh, who has pleaded guilty to violating Ramirez's civil rights. The juvenile admitted on the stand to shouting ""go home you Mexican [expletive]"" after the first fight dispersed, prompting Ramirez to turn back and attack him. The juvenile's testimony was corroborated by Walsh, who admitted to punching Ramirez and knocking him to the ground after he charged the juvenile. Both witnesses said Piekarsky delivered the final blow to Ramirez's head while he was on the ground, but others testified that they couldn't be certain who had actually kicked him. The incident drew national attention to the small town of Shenandoah, highlighting issues of race relations. CNN's Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report.","NEW: Teens acquitted of murder, aggravated assault, ethnic intimidation .

"(CNN) -- Oprah Winfrey, who was pregnant at 14 and lost the baby, said she thought about killing herself and saw the loss of the child as a second chance. In a wide-ranging interview that aired Monday during the premiere of CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight,"" the talk show queen also spoke about love, her long-term partner, Stedman Graham, and what she plans to do with all her money once she's gone. Winfrey, 56, said she was sent to live with her father in Nashville when she was a young teenager. He laid down the rules of his house early, and without knowing she was pregnant. ""'I would rather see a daughter of mine floating down the Cumberland River,' he said, 'than to bring shame on this family and the indecency of an illegitimate child,'"" Winfrey said, quoting her father. ""He's saying that to me, and I know that I am pregnant. So I'm thinking, well, I'm just going to have to kill myself,"" she said. Winfrey did not attempt suicide, though she said she tried things that were cries for help -- like drinking detergent. ""When the baby died, I knew that it was my second chance,"" she said. Winfrey, best known for the ""The Oprah Winfrey Show,"" now runs her own channel, appropriately titled OWN. She described her longtime partner, Stedman Graham, as someone who is ""willing to stand in and stand up"" for her. ""The reason this relationship has worked as well as it has is because we each got to define ourselves in it and not in a traditional form. There's nothing about it that's traditional,"" Winfrey said. ""I am a different kind of woman in that I am pretty assured that had I married I wouldn't have remained married."" ""I'm just not the marrying kind,"" she said. The talk show queen said she's had her heart broken twice. Winfrey also discussed what she plans to do with her massive fortune once she dies. ""When I'm gone, everything that I have is going to go to charity because I don't have children. And I believe that that's what you should do,"" she said. ""To whom much is given, much should be given back.""","Winfrey recalls thinking about killing herself .

"MEMPHIS, Tennessee (CNN) -- When James Earl Ray bought a white Mustang in the summer of 1967, he stood on a streetcorner in downtown Birmingham, Alabama, and pulled the cash out of his shirt pocket, $2,000 in all. James Earl Ray paid $2,000 cash for a white Mustang, similar to this one, the seller told the FBI. ""Mostly twenties, with some $100 bills,"" the seller would later tell the FBI about the sale to Ray, later convicted of assassinating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ""He must have had a roll of twenties, if he paid that guy $2,000 in twenties, that'd be a lot of money,"" said Jerry Ray, James Earl Ray's brother. Police Capt. John Light, who was chief of detectives that year in Ray's hometown of Alton, Illinois, suspects the wad of money came from a still-unsolved bank robbery. While Ray was on the run as a prison escapee from Missouri that summer, two men walked into the Bank of Alton with a pistol and a sawed-off shotgun. Both wore stocking masks. The leaner man went behind the counter, scooped up the cash and fled with close to $30,000.  Ray, King crossed paths before shooting Â»  Within a day or two of that robbery, Ray would leave the area and head to Canada -- just as he did almost a year later when he fled the scene in Memphis, Tennessee, after King's murder. Light told CNN the stolen bank money consisted mainly of $20 bills. The partially burned shotgun and the stocking masks were found abandoned in a wooded area near a cemetery where Ray's mother is buried. Ray returned from Canada and bought the Mustang after seeing a classified ad in Birmingham the month after the robbery. In the months to come, Ray would keep spending $20 bills. When Ray underwent plastic surgery in Los Angeles 30 days before King's death, he paid in cash -- denomination unknown. When he drove back to Birmingham six days before the murder to buy a .30-06 high-powered hunting rifle for just under $250, the gun store salesman later told investigators, ""I remember he paid for the gun with $20 bills, paid cash."" On April 4, 1968, only hours before King would die, the landlady at the boarding house where Ray rented a room told police, ""He gave me a $20 bill"" when he paid for a week's rent just across the street from the Lorraine Motel. In the sporting goods store where Ray went to buy binoculars, the salesman told police, ""He gave me two twenties; I think he had two twenties left... The bills came out of his right pocket, neatly folded, and nothing but bills."" For Light, the bank holdup is the most likely answer to the question of where Ray got the money to travel as a fugitive to Canada and Mexico, then to flee again to Canada and finally London, England, after King's murder. ""Thirty-thousand dollars back in 1967 was a lot of money,"" Light said. In London, Ray ran short of money. Four days before he was caught, he robbed a bank. His thumbprint was found on the holdup note. He got little more than $200 -- enough to buy an airline ticket to Brussels, Belgium, where he hoped to join mercenaries fighting to keep white rule in southern Africa. He was stopped at a London airport when a police sergeant spotted his phony Canadian passport. Ray lived very cheaply on the run. He got change back for his $20 bill at the Memphis boarding house -- a week's rent there was $8.50. The original prosecutors in the Memphis case decided it would not have cost that much for all of Ray's travels. ""He was living on a dollar to two dollars a day,"" said current prosecutor John Campbell. ""He was even darning his own socks to be able to save money.""","Police: James Earl Ray's money came from a bank robbery in his hometown .

"(CNN) -- The head of the company at the center of a toxic spill in Hungary has been arrested, accused of public endangerment and harming the environment, authorities said Monday. Earlier, executive Zoltan Bakonyi had been questioned by authorities. Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, told CNN affiliate MTV that he favored strong government intervention against Bakonyi's aluminum company, MAL Co. ""I proposed appointing a state commissioner to exercise control over the company who should manage the company and its assets until the tasks stemming from the disaster have been fulfilled,"" he said. ""I ask the parliament to accept the proposal. The company should be put under state control and its assets under state closure."" Much of the red sludge has been removed or diluted in the town of Devecer. Residents watched Monday as emergency workers and soldiers walked past in full biohazard suits. Military trucks and cars used to decontaminate the area came through the streets, spraying away the dark red dust that accumulates. Workers told CNN that they have been diluting the mud and removing it constantly. Meanwhile, an eighth victim of the sludge has been found, said Gyorgyi Tottos, an official with Hungary's emergency services department. ""We have found a body near Kolontar that is likely to be the missing person, who would be the eighth victim,"" she told CNN. ""The identification process is ongoing, but we think this is the person who's been missing."" Five European Union experts are due to arrive in Hungary on Monday to find out how badly toxic sludge has damaged the environment and advise on decontamination, the European Union said. And Hungarian authorities continue frantically building dikes in case the dam holding the sludge breaks further, the government said Monday. A ""large section"" of the dam is still showing signs of ruptures, the government said in a statement, meaning there is a ""continuing risk of a possible spill."" The area has been evacuated, and soldiers were on standby Sunday, an official said. The cracked wall is expected to collapse, Tottos told CNN on Sunday. ""We know that it will happen,"" she said, although when is unknown. About 800 people have been evacuated from the village of Kolontar, leaving it essentially empty, she said. Hundreds of soldiers were ready to rescue inhabitants of a nearby village if the wall collapses. A 50-centimeter (19-inch) crack has developed in the wall of the aluminum plant reservoir. If the wall collapses, 500,000 cubic meters of toxic red sludge could spill out. That's about half the amount that spilled last Monday, inundating Kolontar and two other villages. In addition to the eight people known to have been killed, more than 100 were injured. Hungary's state-owned MTI news agency quoted Zoltan Illes, state secretary of environment, as saying the damaged wall could not be saved. Specialists had tried to reinforce the wall Saturday. Orban, the prime minister, who was visiting the stricken area Saturday, said it was ""very likely"" the reservoir wall will collapse. ""It's in very bad shape, and our estimation is that that wall could fall down,"" Orban told reporters in the town of Ajka. ""One consequence is that human lives could be in danger. That's the reason why we pulled out ... all human lives from that area, in order not to have more loss in human life."" The sludge from last Monday's spill reached Europe's mighty Danube river Thursday, raising fears of wider contamination in Hungary and countries downstream, including Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania and the Ukraine. But water test results released Friday indicated the sludge may not harm the Danube after all. The pH, or acidity, level of the Danube water was 8.5 Friday -- slightly above normal but not dangerous and able to sustain life, Tottos said. Readings of pH range from 0 to 14. Levels lower than 7 characterize acids, and levels higher than 7 denote bases; highly acidic or highly basic water can harm living things. The 8.5 pH level and fast-moving currents made officials optimistic that a natural disaster can be avoided, Tottos said. However, on Sunday she said that while saving lives is the priority, officials remain concerned about the long-term effects of the spill and want to protect Europe's waterways. But, she said, it's too soon to tell what those effects might be. ""What happened on Monday has never happened before in Europe, so we will see,"" she said, ""and we will try to avoid a bigger new catastrophe."" The environmental disaster occurred near Ajka, nearly 100 miles west of Budapest. The sludge covered the villages of Kolontar, Devecser, and Somlovasarhely, in some places reaching several feet high, leaving dead animals such as fish and frogs in its wake. The aluminum company, MAL Co., said in a statement Saturday it was doing its utmost ""to avoid further damages and to reinforce the injured deposit."" The company maintains it has performed extensive maintenance work and renovations in the past decade and had followed safety regulations. The company was working to construct dams and defense lines in an attempt to minimize damage, it said. It has also established a relief fund for victims of the spill and was attempting to help in finding accommodations for evacuated people. More than 1,100 residents of Ajka and the surrounding towns are MAL employees, it said. Orban warned Saturday of the ""toughest possible consequences"" for those responsible for the spill and said human error was the cause. ""Behind this tragedy, some human errors and mistakes must exist,"" he said. ""We will reveal all of that, and the consequences will be very serious -- as much as you can imagine."" The exact chemical composition of the sludge has not been revealed, but aluminum processing normally involves compounds that include cyanide, cadmium and chromium. Emergency workers have been pouring plaster and fertilizers on the sludge in hopes that it will counter its alkalinity. Dust from sludge that dries may also pose a threat, Hungary's Interior Ministry has said. It said some workers involved in damage cleanup may need filtering masks. CNN's Antonia Mortensen, Eileen Hsieh, Diana Magnay, Brian Walker and Bharati Naik, and journalist Flora Hevesi contributed to this report.","Zoltan Bakonyi accused of public endangerment, harming the environment .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Christine King Farris was sewing an Easter dress for her daughter in their Atlanta home one rainy April evening when the nightly news was interrupted by a special report. A lone survivor, Farris, 80, is writing a memoir about life with her brother called ""Through It All."" The newscaster announced that Farris' younger brother, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., had been shot in Memphis, Tennessee. Another update came minutes later: King was in critical condition. ""It was a horrible moment,"" Farris said of that night in 1968. ""I tried to call my sister-in-law; the lines were busy. I tried to call my parents; the lines were busy. I couldn't get anybody."" While boarding a plane for Memphis, Farris learned that her brother was dead. It was the beginning of a string of family tragedies. Her only surviving sibling, younger brother A.D., drowned the next summer. Her mother, Alberta, was shot dead five years later while playing the ""Lord's Prayer"" on an organ in church on Sunday morning. Farris raises her hands in bewilderment when she contemplates the losses. ""I think of the things that I've faced in my life, and sometimes I question how I'm still here,"" Farris, 80, said in her office at Spelman College, surrounded by photographs of her famous brother and other civil rights leaders she once knew. ""I'm the lone survivor in my family,"" Farris said. This year, the civil rights community will gather in Memphis on April 4 to mark the 40th anniversary of King's assassination, but Farris will not join them. She is talking publicly about the death of her younger brother for the first time, but a return to Memphis is not part of her agenda. ""I can't go,"" she said. ""I've not been there since the time we went to gather my brother. My memory of Memphis is not a pleasant one. It's one that I cannot erase.""   Farris is remembering her brother in another way. She is writing a memoir about her life with him called ""Through It All."" A formal and reserved woman, Farris has spent the past year delving into her ugliest memories. ""It's been a real challenge,"" she said. ""I've had to relive those moments. Sometimes it affects me more than others. I try to live with it."" She says it's important for her to push past those painful memories, because she wants to humanize her younger brother. Everyone has heard about King, the civil rights icon. She wants to strip away those platitudes to reveal the playful brother she knew.   ""He was normal as a person could be,"" she said. ""I really want people to understand that. I want people not to think of him as some mythic character from out of space."" The mythic nature of King's ministry, though, is palpable in Farris' roomy office at Spelman, the predominantly black women's college where she has taught education for 49 years. Farris stores photos of her brother on her desktop computer as screensavers. As each image shifts to another, her computer plays highlights of her brother's most famous public speeches. Isaac N. Farris Jr., her only son, says his mother still plays recordings of her brother's speeches and reads his manuscripts at home. They weren't just siblings. They were friends. ""She was the first one to meet Mrs. Coretta [King's wife, Coretta Scott King]. She lent him money for his engagement rings,"" he said. ""Over the years, she's especially talked about missing the friendship they had."" The resemblance to her brother is obvious up close. She has the same square face and the same measured, Baptist preacher's drawl. She says she's accustomed to people staring at her when they encounter her in Ebenezer Baptist Church, the Atlanta church her brother once led that she still attends. ""Sometimes people will point me out and say, 'That's Dr. King's sister,' "" she said. ""And, of course, I'm immediately surrounded by people. Sometimes, it's a little uncomfortable. I try to be as cordial as I can. ... People come up and ask, 'Are you Dr. King's sister?' I can't say no."" Farris says she had no inkling that her brother would become such an iconic figure. She remembers the little brother who loved playing pool, doing the jitterbug dance and telling jokes. She also recalls his nickname as a young man: Tweed. ""He had this tweed suit, and he loved it,"" she said, smiling. ""He would wear it so much so the boys nicknamed him Tweed."" Farris' son says his mother still retains some of that playful side herself. He occasionally catches her dancing around the house to contemporary R&B music. ""I've seen her do the electric slide,"" he said. ""She gets a kick out of it."" When Farris' brother was thrust to the forefront of the civil rights movement, both were aware of the danger to him. But they never talked about it. ""When you are a part of it, you don't really take the time to sit down and think,"" she said. ""It didn't really bother us too much. We were conscious that it could happen, but it didn't occupy front space, so to speak."" When April 4, 1968, did come, Farris says, others stepped in to help her shoulder her grief. Sen. Robert Kennedy dispatched a plane to Atlanta to take her and King's widow to Memphis. Her voice remains level as she talks about the plane ride. Then her eyes start to mist. She says she never left the plane when it arrived. She watched her brother A.D. come on the plane with the Rev. Andrew Young and the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, two of King's closest aides. ""They were crying like babies,"" she said. She says she has tried to remember when she last talked to her brother, but it's frustrating. ""I've been trying to think about that. He had a meeting with his staff the Saturday before he went to Memphis, but I didn't get to talk to him. Then ..."" Farris halts herself in mid-sentence. Then her voice trails off. Her only son says his mom has been a ""rock"" for the family. He says he's never seen her cry about the loss of his famous uncle. The only time he remembers seeing her cry is when her remaining brother, A.D., drowned in 1969. ""My mother let out a yell that still to this day brings tears to my eyes,"" he said. Farris has carved out her own life of distinction. She married and has two children with Isaac N. Farris Sr., an entrepreneur. She's written a children's book on her brother titled ""My Brother Martin: A Sister Remembers Growing Up with  the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr."" She's also dabbled in public speaking and served as an executive at the King Center, the Atlanta-based center devoted to the teaching of King's nonviolent philosophy. Only recently, though, Farris experienced another series of losses. Her brother's widow, Coretta Scott King, died two years ago from cancer. And Yolanda King, her brother's oldest child, died from an apparent heart condition last year. Yet she and her son shrug off any suggestion that her family, like the Kennedy clan, is somehow marked for tragedy. ""God never puts on us what we can't bear,"" she said. ""We never embraced that; others have,"" added her son, who is CEO of the King Center. ""We have felt through it all, we're still blessed. That's the way we were taught."" Forty years after her brother's untimely death, Farris will return to Memphis, but only through her memories. As she sits in her office surrounded by those memories, she says it's now more urgent than ever that she add her own chapter to his story. She's the only one left. ""I thought about all that I've been through and all these memories and sometimes it gets tough,"" she said. ""By being the lone survivor, if I don't do this, a part of history will be left out.""","King's sister was sewing an Easter dress when she saw TV report he was shot .
