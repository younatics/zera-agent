"Taxpayers may have to cover a multimillion-pound shortfall in compensation to victims of Jimmy Savile. His £3.3million estate will be used by authorities to meet claims by hundreds of people who suffered his vile abuse, but any excess compensation will be funded by taxpayers. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said yesterday that the rogue DJ and TV presenter was a sickening sex abuser who ‘exploited the trust of a nation for his own vile purposes’. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt issues a public apology on behalf of the government and the NHS for Savile's reign of terror in hospitals across the country . A High Court ruling earlier this year said victims could make claims of . up to £60,000 from the estate, the NHS or the BBC, where Savile abused . children in dressing rooms. Mr Hunt confirmed that compensation claims . linked to NHS hospitals will be met by the public purse. More than 500 victims have been identified by Scotland Yard and the . NSPCC, meaning the total cost of claims could run into tens of millions . of pounds. In addition, many are represented by specialist lawyers who have run up . substantial legal costs over the past 20 months. In the . Commons yesterday, Labour’s shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: . ‘Given what has been revealed, shouldn’t the government now consider . allocating public finances to ensure all people damaged by Savile are . properly supported and compensated.’ In . response, Mr Hunt said: ‘The government will underwrite this so if . there are any claims that are not able to be met by the estate we will . finance that from the public purse. ‘But we do think the estate is the first place to start, for obvious reasons.’ Abuse: Jimmy Savile was given open access to hospitals all over Britain where he attacked hundreds of children, even when he was 82 and even took glass eyes from the dead and abused their bodies . Investigators discovered Savile had at least 60 victims at the Leeds hospital aged between five and 75 . Savile investigators spoke to 60 people who gave accounts of their experiences at the hospital 33 of these people were hospital patients and 19 were hospital staff - all female . First case of abuse was reported in 1962 when Savile was 36. The most recent victim was in 2009 when he was aged 82 . Forty three of the reported encounters took place in public areas such as wards, corridors and offices . Incidents ranged from lewd remarks and inappropriate touching to sexual assault and, in three cases, rape. Nine victims told a member of staff about what happened - but none were reported to senior managers . Leeds probe interviewed more than 200 people and reviewed more than 1,300 documents over 50 years . He added it was not possible to bring in laws to stop ‘all criminal, . vile activity’, with the Disclosure and Barring Service, formerly . Criminal Records Bureau relying on a culture that ensures the public and . patients feel able to speak out and are listened to. Savile amassed his wealth during six decades of fame as a TV presenter, . DJ and charity fundraiser. His estate was frozen following revelations . about his activities as a predatory paedophile and sex attacker. He . died in October 2011, aged 84, before detailed claims of abuse against . him were properly made public, despite rumours about his behaviour. In April, the High Court ordered that adverts be published advising victims of Savile that they could claim compensation. They were put in two national newspapers as well as on the Channel . Islands, which he often visited. The claims scheme will stay open for a . year. Mr Hunt told a stunned House of Commons how ‘time and again’ victims were ignored because Savile was seen as a ‘somewhat eccentric national treasure. In reality he was a sickening sex abuser who ‘exploited the trust of a nation for his own vile purposes’, . Details of the later DJ’s reign of terror in NHS hospitals across the country were revealed in 28 reports released today. The investigations discovered at least 60 victims aged between five and 75 at 28 institutions including Leeds, Broadmoor and Stoke Mandeville hospital. Savile boasted about having sex with corpses and had jewellery made from glass eyes he removed from their bodies. Mr Hunt said some of the accounts revealed in the ‘litany’ of abuse were ‘too horrific’ to repeat in the House of Commons. Mr Hunt told MPs: ‘Today’s reports will shake this House and our country to the core. ‘Savile was a callous, opportunistic, wicked predator who abused and raped individuals, many of them patients and young people, who expected and had a right to expect to be safe. His actions span five decades – from the 1960s to 2010. ‘The family favourite loved by millions courted popularity and used it to perpetrate and cover up his own evil acts.’ During five decades of abuse, Savile used his celebrity to gain access to patients on wards and ‘inexplicably’ was even allowed to watch female patients stripped naked for bathing, Mr Hunt said. ‘As a nation at that time we held Savile in our affection as a somewhat eccentric national treasure with a strong commitment to charitable causes. ‘Today’s reports show that in reality he was a sickening and prolific sexual abuser who repeatedly exploited the trust of a nation for his own vile purposes.’ Savile's victims at Leeds General Infirmary (LGI) ranged from five-years-old to pensioners and included men, women, boys and girls - including some who were dead Read more: . Even . when victims did speak out, they were ignored by staff who either did . not believe them or were afraid of the power Savile was able to wield. Mr . Hunt went on: ‘The systems in place to protect people were either too . weak or were ignored. People and institutions turned a blind eye. ‘So . today I want to apologise on behalf of the Government and the NHS to . all the victims who were abused by Savile in NHS-run institutions. ‘We let them down badly and however long ago it may have been, many of them are still reliving the pain they went through.’ He . urged MPs to remember Savile’s victims: ‘They were brave. They have . been vindicated. Savile was a coward. He has been disgraced. ‘The system failed to prevent him from abusing. It failed to act when people spoke up. We must not allow this to happen again.’ Mr Hunt announced he was writing to every NHS leader in the country telling them to review their safeguarding arrangements ‘to ensure they are confident about patient safety’. He stressed that the law has been toughened since Savile prowled the corridors of hospitals but the NHS still has ‘a long way to go’. However, Mr Hunt insisted rules on protecting patients ‘must not hinder the extraordinary contribution’ of thousands of volunteers and fundraisers working in the NHS every day. ‘They are the opposite of Savile and we need to ensure their remarkable contribution is sustained,’ he added.","Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt issues public apology on behalf of NHS .

"Jobless immigrants are to be denied housing benefit. Writing in the Mail today, Iain Duncan Smith and Theresa May say Britain’s generous welfare system should no longer be a magnet for citizens of other EU states. The Work and Pensions Secretary and the Home Secretary claim Labour doled out millions of pounds ‘for people to sit on benefits’ while opening the door to mass migration. They pointed to incendiary figures showing the number of Britons in jobs plunged by 413,000 between 2005 and 2010, while the number of working foreigners soared by 736,000. Less appealing: Ministers have outlined a tough new crackdown on migrants claiming benefits in a bid to get annual net migration down to the tens of thousands . New rules: Home secretary Theresa May, pictured left, and Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith, pictured right, claim the Government's reforms to welfare and immigration systems are beginning to pay off . They said this was a shameful betrayal and evidence that immigration can displace some British workers and depress wages for the low-skilled. Under the new rules, to be introduced in April, new European arrivals claiming jobseeker’s allowance will not be able to receive housing benefit as well. Those who get jobs but then go on to out-of-work handouts will be able to claim housing benefit for up to six months. After this they will have to show they have a genuine prospect of work. Housing benefit helps cover accommodation costs for people who are out of work or on low incomes. Strict: Under the new regulations, EU arrivals claiming jobseeker's allowance will not be able to claim housing benefit as well . Under emergency regulations that took . effect on January 1, all new EU migrants now have to wait for at least . three months before they can claim out-of-work benefits. In . their article, Mr Duncan Smith and Mrs May say the Government’s reforms . to the welfare and immigration systems are beginning to pay off. Between 2010 and 2013, the number of . Britons in jobs rose by 538,000, while the number of working foreigners . increased by 247,000. The figures are even more striking for the year 2012-13 with 348,000 more British workers and only 26,000 from abroad. Employment minister Esther McVey has claimed the Government's long-term economic plan has helped create 1.6million private sector jobs . The ministers say the new £26,000-a-year . cap on household benefit claims has affected 33,000 families and . encouraged up to 19,000 to return to work. A limit on economic migrants from outside the EU, changes to the rules on family and student visas and a crackdown on bogus colleges have helped bring down net migration by nearly a third from its peak. However, Mr Duncan Smith and Mrs May admit there is ‘much more to do’ to meet a Tory target of getting annual net migration down to the tens of thousands. Ministers have set out a series of measures to limit migrant access to public services and benefits to try to reduce further so-called ‘pull factors’ to the UK. Landlords will be fined up to £3,000 if they rent a property to an illegal immigrant, while non-EU migrants will be expected to pay a levy of £200 a year to access the NHS if they do not have private healthcare. The changes to the housing benefit rules will not affect UK and Irish Republic nationals, or European migrants genuinely self-employed or in a job. European nationals who have been working in the UK, and are subsequently made redundant and claim benefits, will not be affected. Historically, EU migrants have been able to lodge a claim for the benefit as soon as they arrive in Britain and pass a ‘habitual residence test’ under EU rules. The Government’s reforms mean they will not be able to make a housing benefit claim at any point unless they are in work. Employment minister Esther McVey said the Government’s long-term economic plan had helped create 1.6million private sector jobs. By IAIN DUNCAN SMITH and THERESA MAY . It was a shameful betrayal of thousands of British workers. For years Labour presided over a labour market where the number of foreign people in jobs rocketed to record levels – while thousands of British workers were left on the sidelines, facing the prospect of long-term unemployment. Today – as Work and Pensions Secretary and Home Secretary – we publish a devastating analysis which lays bare the shocking scale of Labour’s failure. But this analysis also demonstrates how this Government’s long-term economic plan is putting things right. Welfare reform and controlling immigration are at the very core of this plan – and if we are to strike the right balance for a strong, sustainable economy, we cannot look at these issues in isolation. Both Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured with Prime Minister David Cameron, and Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith claim Labour doled out millions in benefits while allowing mass migration . Labour failed to recognise that if you have a welfare system that doesn’t make work worthwhile or support people into jobs, you pay the price elsewhere. With one hand, Labour doled out millions of pounds for people to sit on benefits. With the other, they opened the door to mass migration, with those from abroad filling jobs which our own people didn’t want or couldn’t get. In just five years between 2005 and 2010, for every British person who fell out of work, almost two foreign nationals gained employment. Now, the Home Office and Department for Work and Pensions are working together to put this travesty right. Already, we are seeing success in reforming welfare and restoring the incentive for British people to get back to work. Iain Duncan Smith argues that the Government is now reversing the damage done under Labour . Take the benefit cap: already 33,000 households have had their benefits cut so they receive no more than average earnings, and 19,000 potentially capped claimants have returned to work. As a result, as our economy picks up, we have reversed the damaging trend under Labour. The latest data shows that of the rise in employment over the past year, over 90 per cent went to UK nationals. We’re also putting right the mess Labour left on immigration. Of course immigration, over the generations, has made a tremendously rich contribution to our country, both culturally and in terms of the talent it brings – but it must be controlled. We know that the idea there’s a set number of jobs to be divided up and handed around is wrong, and things are far more complicated than the simplistic notion that all immigrants come and ‘take British jobs’. But evidence from the Migration Advisory Committee and other academic studies has demonstrated that immigration can displace some British workers in the labour market. So we have tightened up the system... and the latest figures show our reforms are working. For those migrants who do come here, we’re ensuring they are unable to take unfair advantage of our system by accessing benefits as soon as they arrive. For example, we introduced rules so that from January 1 this year we are banning individuals from receiving out-of-work benefits until they have been living in the UK for three months. And we will go still further: from the beginning of April we will be removing entitlement to housing benefit altogether for this group. In addition, EU migrants can only claim jobseeker’s allowance for six months unless they have genuine prospects of finding work. No longer can people come here from abroad and expect to get something for nothing. Together, these new immigration and benefit checks will clamp down on those trying to exploit the system. We can ensure that Britain’s growing economy and dynamic jobs market deliver for those who work hard and play by the rules.","New rules mean EU arrivals claiming jobseeker's allowance will not be able to receive housing benefit as well .

"A JetBlue plane made an emergency landing in California on Thursday after a reported engine failure. Flight 1416, which was traveling from Long Beach Airport to Austin, Texas, landed at 9.30am at its departure airport around 15 minutes after takeoff. There were 142 passengers and five crew on board. Four people needed medical attention, including one passenger who suffered an injury coming down the slide and another who was taken to hospital for shortness of breath. Scroll down for video .

One of the passengers on board, Twilight actor Jackson Rathbone, revealed his relief at having landed safely following the mid-air drama and exiting the plane via the emergency slide. Mr Rathbone, who played Jasper Hale in the wildly popular vampire franchise, told ABC7 that the right engine exploded and smoke clouded the plane. He said that the plane began to rock from side to side and all he could do was pray and hold on to his wife and young son. The actor then posted a picture to whosay.com showing passengers coming off the plane with the help of the Long Beach Fire Department. He wrote: 'From the bus, we all just followed one after another. I never felt so okay being a lemming.' He then posted a selfie, adding: 'Where are we going/ don't care we're alive- face.' Long Beach Fire Department told the LA Times that the pilot used an 'extinguishing agent' after smoke billowed from the engine. Passengers were told to 'brace themselves' over the tannoy for the emergency landing.

"The pilot who died in a tragic accident aboard Virgin's SpaceShipTwo has been identified. Michael Alsbury, a father of two and pilot with Scaled Composites, was killed on Friday when SpaceShipTwo exploded just minutes after it detached from its mother ship, WhiteKnightTwo. Michelle Saling, Alsbury's widow, told MailOnline, 'I have lost the love of my life. I am living in hell right now.' The identity of the other pilot, who was critically injured when he ejected from the plane at 45,000 feet, is still unknown. Alsbury, 39, had piloted SpaceShipTwo as recently as August 28. Scroll down for videos . Tragedy: Michael Alsbury (above) has been identified as the pilot who died in Friday's explosion . Gone too soon: Alsbury (above) was married and had 15 years of flying experience . Fatal moment: The Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo plane is pictured above coming to pieces after a mid-air launch uses an experimental rocket fuel. It crashed to the ground in a remote region of California's Mojave Desert, killing one pilot and seriously injuring another . Addressing the media at the crash site on Saturday morning, Virgin CEO Richard Branson said, 'This is a very tough time for all of us at Virgin Galactic, The Spaceship Company and Scaled Composites, and our thoughts remain with the families of the brave Scaled pilots, and all those affected by this tragedy.' He added, 'In testing the boundaries of human capabilities and technologies, we are standing on the shoulders of giants. Yesterday, we fell short. We will now comprehensively assess the results of the crash and are determined to learn from this and move forward together as a company.' Branson then closed out his statement by saying, 'I truly believe that humanity’s greatest achievements come out of our greatest pain. This team is a group of the bravest, brightest, most determined and most resilient people I have ever had the privilege of knowing. We are determined to honour the bravery of the pilots and teams here by learning from this tragedy. Only then can we move forward, united behind a collective desire to push the boundaries of human endeavor.' Branson also said he had never met Alsbury before, though photo and video evidence of the two celebrating a successful run in April 2013 seems to suggest otherwise. The two are seen clearly talking and posing for photos in video released by Virgin Galactic, making the blunder that much more embarrassing for Branson and his team. Past meeting: Oddly, Branson said he had never met Alsbury, even though the two can be seen talking and celebrating following a flight in April 2013 . Pilot pals: Alsbury (second from left) with fellow pilots (left to right) Clint Nichols, Brian Maisler, Mark Stuckey and Dave McKay . Branson flew to the site of the crash immediately after the tragedy occurred on Friday, and has been working closely with authorities to try and determine what went wrong during Friday's flight. Even though Richard Branson claims he had never met him, Michael Alsbury was one of the biggest contributors to the man's dream of sending people into space from the beginning. Alsbury had flown numerous missions on SpaceShipTwo for years, including the all important first successful rocket-powered run in April 2013. He was also the pilot in the first glide flight back in 2010, and flew as recently as August 28 of this year. In video from the 2013 mission, it is clear what a humble man Alsbury was, and just how dedicated he was to his job. As Branson and Virgin Galactic exec George Whitesides proudly talk about all they have accomplished, and how 'jazzed' they are with the success of the run, Alsbury and fellow pilot Mark Stuckey say nothing and seem to avoid the spotlight, this even though they had just accomplished the remarkable feat of piloting SpaceShipTwo as it broke the sound barrier. Speaking with MailOnline, neighbor Leonard Alvarez said of Alsbury, 'He’s one of a kind, very, very special, an incredible individual who everybody liked.' He added, 'Mike was just an incredible human being and my friend. He was a kind, unselfish man and I’m going to miss him. Everybody here will miss him.' The 39-year-old leaves behind two children, a son and a daughter, and his wife Michelle Saling. Said Alvarez, 'They are the perfect, ideal family, great neighbors and great friends. It is very sad.' In a blog-post en route, Branson wrote: 'I am writing this as we refuel on one of the most difficult trips I have ever had to make. I will be in Mojave soon to join the Virgin Galactic and Scaled Composite teams involved in the SpaceShipTwo flight test program. 'Mojave is also where I want to be – with the dedicated and hard-working people who are now in shock at this devastating loss... We’ve always known that the road to space is extremely difficult - and that every new transportation system has to deal with bad days early in their history.' He concluded: 'Space is hard - but worth it. We will persevere and move forward together.' In a press conference Friday afternoon, George Whitesides, chief executive of Virgin Galactic, said; ‘Our primary thoughts at the moment are with the crew and families and we are doing everything we can for them now.' 'Space is hard, and today was a tough day. The future rest on hard days like this.' Briefing: Alsbury (second from left) getting briefed by David McKay (center) before the April 2013 flight . Stuart Witt, who is in charge of the Mojave Air and Space Port, where SpaceShipTwo was launched Friday, also remained optimistic about the future of space travel. He said: 'Stay the course. This is not easy. If it was easy it would not be interesting to me and my colleagues standing next to me.' ‘We are doing this for you and your generation. It is a cause far greater than any one of us singularly. I compare it to the Magellan expedition [the first circumnavigation of the Earth].’ The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has also launched an investigation into the crash. Pet project: Branson applauds Alsbury after his successful run in April 2013 . Celebrate: Branson then posed for photos with Alsbury and Stuckey . In May, Virgin Galactic announced it was switching the fuel used in the vehicle's hybrid rocket motor, hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene, a form of rubber, to a polyamide-based plastic. During a media tour of Virgin Galactic's Mojave facilities on October 4 that marked the tenth anniversary of the final flight of SpaceShipOne, the suborbital vehicle that won the $10-million Ansari X Prize, company officials said they expected to resume powered test flights 'imminently' once qualification tests of the new motor were done. At the International Symposium for Personal and Commercial Spaceflight in Las Cruces, New Mexico, on October 15, Virgin Galactic chief executive George Whitesides said the company had completed those qualification tests. 'We expect to get back into powered test flight quite soon,' he said. SpaceShipTwo has been under development at Mojave Air and Spaceport in the desert northeast of Los Angeles. SpaceShipTwo is carried aloft by a specially designed mothership and then released before igniting its rocket for suborbital thrill ride into space and then a return to Earth as a glider. Ticket cost: The starting price for flights is $250,000 (£150,000) - the first ceremonial flight will be undertaken by Richard Branson and his family. Training: Passengers are required to go through a 'Pre-Flight Experience Programme', including three days of pre-flight preparing onsite at the spaceport to ensure passengers are physically and mentally fit to fly. Once aboard: SpaceShipTwo will carry six passengers and two pilots. Each passenger gets the same seating position with two large windows - one to the side and one overhead. A climb to 50,000ft before the rocket engine ignites. Passengers become 'astronauts' when they reach the Karman line, the boundary of Earth's atmosphere, at which point SpaceShipTwo separates from its carrier aircraft, White Knight II.

"As a professional dancer, Pasha Kovalev is used to pushing his body - and, apart from an occasional sniffle, it's served him well. 'I had a few colds, but nothing serious. I was always on the dancefloor, which kept me in good shape,' says the 33-year-old, who has appeared on Strictly Come Dancing since 2011, partnering celebrities such as singer Kimberley Walsh and, in the new series, Countdown's Rachel Riley. But it was this hard-working lifestyle, he believes, which led to a bout of illness so severe it could have cost him his life. In step: Strictly Come Dancing partners Rachel Riley and Pasha Kovalev . In 2006, Pasha was living in New York, where he came down with a sore throat - accompanied by fever, heavy limbs, trouble swallowing and extreme fatigue. 'I assumed it was just a common cold,' says Pasha, who is from Russia. But over the course of six days he became so ill his friend called an ambulance. After a battery of tests, he was diagnosed with Lemierre's syndrome. A complication of tonsillitis, it causes inflammation in the head or neck. The condition causes the bacteria infecting the throat to get into the jugular vein -– the main vein that runs through the neck and connects the head to the heart. This leads to the lining of the vessel becoming inflamed, disrupting the flow of blood and triggering the formation of a blood clot, which is infected with the bacteria. After a scan found Pasha had a blood clot, doctors told him there was a danger of it spreading into his brain, where it could result in a stroke. He was given antibiotics and blood-thinners to try to prevent it from getting bigger so his body could break it down. Another potential risk is of bacteria escaping into the bloodstream within broken pieces of clot or independently. This could lead to life-threatening blood poisoning, or septicaemia. Hooked up to drips and unable to eat solid food, Pasha lost 20lb in less than a fortnight and felt weak, but he stayed positive. 'I am quite chilled out and my attitude was: “If the blood clot moves, it moves, but for now I am still here.” ' Deceptive: Pasha thought he had a minor cold, but after a slew of tests he was diagnosed with Lemierre's syndrome, a complication of tonsillitis . Thankfully, Pasha's clot did dissolve and he was discharged from hospital within three weeks - but he was left with a weakened immune system for months. Though Lemierre's is rare, complications stemming from throat infections are not uncommon. 'Sore throats are more common than any other type of infection,' says Andrew McCombe, ear, nose and throat (ENT) consultant and spokesman for ENT UK. 'Though the majority will be nothing to worry about, if it gets nasty, bacteria can get into the bloodstream, make you very sick and interfere with the function of organs. In exceptional circumstances, they can cause septicaemia, which can lead to death.' The three main structures of the throat that can feel sore are the larynx (voice box), pharynx (the throat) and tonsils. Inflammation of these areas are known as laryngitis, pharyngitis and tonsillitis. The latter is the most common, with most children experiencing it at least once. Experts are warning that tonsillitis is on the rise, and this is causing an increase in a condition called quinsy. This is a complication of tonsillitis, and causes pus to develop between the tonsils and the back of the throat. 'Quinsy is common,' says Mr McCombe. 'We see two or three cases a week where I work, and there are 6,000 admissions for quinsy across the country every year. We're seeing more as we witness a reduction in the number of tonsillectomies.' As well as a painful abscess (up to the size of a walnut) and sore throat, patients with quinsy may have trouble swallowing, which can lead to drooling, bad breath and an earache. If the infection gets into the bloodstream, it could lead to rigors (shivering), though doctors are unsure why, says ENT surgeon George Murty, of University Hospitals Leicester. 'Cases have increased two to three times in the past few years compared to previously,' says Mr Murty. 'It's not just more common, it is also more severe. 'I see more complications, such as the pus spreading. If it gets to the spinal cord, it could potentially cause paralysis. 'In the past year I've seen three major complications of quinsy. When I started 25 years ago, you'd see it once every couple of years.' He puts the increase down to GPs prescribing fewer antibiotics for sore throats - due to concerns over antibiotic resistance - as well as fewer children having their tonsils removed. 'The Government is keen to reduce the costs of surgery. Previously, the decision on whether you'd benefit from a tonsillectomy was made by the GP,' says Mr Murty. 'Quinsy is common. We see two or three cases a week where I work, and there are 6,000 . admissions for quinsy across the country every year. We're seeing more . as we witness a reduction in the number of tonsillectomies.' 'Now it's increasingly more difficult for GPs to refer patients for tonsillectomies. You need to have many more episodes of tonsillitis - usually seven a year - before you have the operation.' But quinsy isn't the only complication of a sore throat. A quarter of children with throat infections will have a middle ear infection, or glue ear, where the fluid between the inner ear and eardrum becomes infected by bacteria. 'The bacteria can spread up the eustacian tube, which connects the back of the throat to the ear,' says Mr Murty. 'It can also happen when the tonsils and andenoids - lumps of tissue above the tonsils - swell up, blocking off this tube and meaning you can't ventilate it properly. This can lead to hearing loss. Fortunately, it's reversible.' Another potentially serious, but thankfully rare, complication arising from a throat infection is scarlet fever - characterised by a distinctive pinkish rash - and rheumatic fever, which leads to joint pain and swelling, and inflammation of the heart. These conditions develop in response to so-called 'strep throat' - a throat infection caused by streptococcal bacteria. Throat infections can also result in glomerulonephritis - an inflammation of the kidneys that can ultimately lead to renal failure. It can be caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissue as a consequence of the infection. And research has even pointed to a link between throat infections caused by the streptococcal bacteria and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), characterised by anxious thoughts and repetitive behaviours such as handwashing. Pushy: Pasha, pictured with Kimberley Walsh, says 'Now if I push myself, I make sure I have time to recuperate' A 2009 study from Columbia University concluded some cases of OCD could be caused by the body's attempt to attack the bacteria. One theory is that antibodies made by the body to attack the bacteria react with parts of the brain. However, many experts are unconvinced of the link. Despite the potential complications of a sore throat, Mr McCombe stresses most are minor and unlikely to lead to a serious problem. 'If it's an isolated sore throat, I wouldn't be too stressed,' he says. 'But if you also have joint pain, which could indicate bacteria spreading into the bloodstream, muscle ache, a temperature, headache and you feel really rotten, give it up to 48 hours and do the sensible things, such as taking on fluids, painkillers and anti-inflammatories. 'But if you feel worse after 48 hours, consider seeing your GP.' After Pasha recovered from Lemierre's, he decided to stop putting himself through gruelling dance competitions and concentrate on performing in shows. This led him into the world of TV via the U.S. version of So You Think You Can Dance, where the Strictly producers spotted him. 'For most of us, if everything is going well, you take things for granted - and that includes your health,' says Pasha. 'Now if I push myself, I make sure I have time to recuperate. Strictly can be intense, so I go on holiday as soon as it's over.' Pasha: The Autobiography Of TV's Hottest Dance Star by Pasha Kovalev (John Blake, £14.99).

"Haemorrhoids occur when the anal cushions become enlarged . Around 50 per cent of us will suffer from piles (or haemorrhoids) - swollen tissue and blood vessels in the back passage. Lis Jackson, 57, a paediatric secretary and mother-of-four from Inverness, took part in a study to determine the best way of treating this common problem, as she tells DIANA PILKINGTON. Piles have troubled me since the birth of my second child, Janine, who's now 35. At first it was just a bit of discomfort when I went to the loo. Occasionally, the piles would stick out, but I'd just push them back and put up with it. Over the years it got worse, though. A decade ago the piles had prolapsed to the point where I couldn't push them up. They'd bleed, and were getting more painful and itchy. I finally decided to take action three years ago after a test under the NHS bowel cancer screening programme found blood in my stool (which can be a symptom of cancer), and I had to submit another sample. The second test was clear, but it spurred me to see my GP about the piles. A prescription haemorrhoid  ointment, Scheriproct, relieved the itching, but the bleeding was still there. So, last summer, I had a colonoscopy (where they examine your bowel with a camera on a tube) at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness. This ruled out cancer, but my surgeon Professor Angus Watson said he would treat my piles with a procedure  called banding. They put small rubber bands around the piles, cutting off the blood supply and making them shrink.It didn't help. So at my six-week follow-up, he said I could take part in a trial comparing two other treatment methods. This would involve having traditional haemorrhoidectomy (where they cut off the piles) or stapled haemorrhoidectomy (where they lift the piles back in place and secure the area with titanium staples).I wouldn't know until the day of my treatment which one they'd do, but I didn't mind: I just wanted a solution. On the day of the op, I was told I'd be having the stapling. Back home, I followed post-operative instructions - taking the painkiller co-codamol, laxatives, and warm baths to help ease the pain. The pain lasted a week. More concerning was the urgency I experienced, which meant being within easy reach of a loo. But after three weeks it had all settled down. Now, three months later, the outcome is fantastic and the piles have gone. We're all so embarrassed to speak about these things,  but I just wish I'd had them treated sooner. Stapled haemorrhoidectomy accounts for 20 per cent of all piles surgery . Professor Angus Watson is a consultant colorectal surgeon at NHS Highland and chief investigator of a trial comparing piles treatments, led by the University of Aberdeen. Haemorrhoids occur when the anal cushions - pads of soft tissue, filled with blood vessels, that form part of the watertight seal around the back passage - become enlarged. Common symptoms are pain, bleeding, itching and prolapse - when the piles start to descend through the anal canal. Causes include chronic straining, constipation and pregnancy. Piles can also run in families. They can go away of their own accord. If not, a GP would generally recommend avoiding straining, taking mild laxatives, and eating plenty of fruit and fibre to loosen stools. Creams or suppositories can give some relief. Many contain a steroid which can take away the itch but won't cure the problem. The most common treatment is rubber-band ligation, where bands are placed around the haemorrhoids to interfere with the blood supply and shrink them. A third of patients will get a good result with this. Other treatments are surgical, usually for piles which protrude all the time. In one procedure, excisional haemorrhoidectomy, we remove the piles using a cautery device - a surgical instrument through which an electric current is passed, cutting off the haemorrhoids and sealing the tissue with heat. Stapled haemorrhoidectomy accounts for 20 per cent of all piles surgery. Here, we use a special stapling instrument, around 18in long and 1in wide, to remove a section of the lining of the lower rectum. This allows the protruding haemorrhoids to be pulled back inside the anal canal, and cuts the blood vessels that supply the piles. Then we fire in staples to seal the area. These will either stay in the patient or get passed out during bowel movements. As piles operations are common - 29,000 a year - surgeons need to know the best option for controlling symptoms long-term. So the National Institute of Health Research has given us £1.3 million to carry out a definitive trial across 32 centres. Called eTHoS, it's a comparison of stapled versus excisional surgery. Lis was randomly selected to have the stapling. First the patient is examined under general anaesthetic to check the size of the piles, which can be up to 3cm long. Through a hollow tube, we weave a purse string stitch (which you can pull tight, like a drawstring) into the lining of the rectum just above the piles. We insert the stapler into the rectum and draw the stitch tight, so that it pulls a ring of tissue, about 1cm wide, into the stapler - this has the effect of hoisting the haemorrhoids back into the anal canal. A knife inside the stapler then cuts off the trapped tissue. At the same time, it fires two or three rings of titanium staples to seal off the area. Then we apply local anaesthetic. It takes 20 to 30 minutes - the same as traditional excision. The risks for both methods are the same: pain, post-operative bleeding, and men may have difficulty emptying their bladder, so may need a catheter overnight. Some patients also describe urgency (the body can mistake healing tissue for faecal matter) but that soon settles. At this stage I don't know which technique is better. This trial will help us find out. To find out about taking part in the trial, talk to your GP.

"Thousands of villagers in the Philippines are being evacuated in response to warnings that an active volcano is set to erupt. Mount Mayon, located in the east of the Philippines, will experience a 'hazardous eruption' within weeks, warned the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. The volcano is already experiencing an ongoing gentle eruption, as lava fragments flow down the slope of Mount Mayon, prompting authorities to enforce the evacuation. Scroll down for video . Mount Mayon spews lava and gas in an eruption in 2006, endangering nearby villages . Taken from Legaspi City, this photograph show the smoke billowing from Mount Mahon on Thursday . Thousands of Philippino villagers have been evacuated after reports warned of the imminent explosion . Increased restlessness in the mountain was recorded on Thursday night, with nearly four times the amount of lava fragments and boulders rolling down from Mayon’s crater. These levels indicate that the lava dome has breached the south-eastern side of the volcano, coming on the heels of volcanic gas and molten lava which are making the crater red, creating a glow which can be seen at night. The volcano shows 'a noticeable escalation of unrest,' said the Philippine Volcanology and Seismology Institute, as the number of low-frequency volcanic earthquakes has also increased. More than 10,000 people have been evacuated so far as the Institute has further raised the alert level to 'critical' for the mountain, the agency's third highest alert level after eruption and imminent eruption. Renato Solidum, who heads the government’s volcano monitoring agency said, 'It’s already erupting, but not explosive.' The Institute of Volcanology and Seismology has raised the level to 'critical' for the mountain . The volcano has erupted 50 times over the past 500 years, threatening local towns . Large white crosses have been erected by villagers at the entrance of their neighbourhoods, in the hope that they will protect them from harm. 'Currently, the activity is just lava coming down. If there is an explosion, all sides of the volcano are threatened.' Large white crosses have been erected by villagers at the entrance of their neighbourhoods, in the hope that they will protect them from harm. The mayor of close-by farming town Santo Domingo told ABC News that his village had previously been adversely affected by Mount Mayon. In 1987 Mayon erupted with pyroclastic flows, which equates to fast-flowing volcanic debris and super-heated gas which destroys everything it comes into contact with, almost decimating the population. 'We are praying that it would not be the worst-case scenario,' Aguas said, noting that only 10% of residents in his town had started to evacuate. The mountain is a popular tourist site, located 340 km from the capital of Manila, in the coconut producing province of Albay. It has erupted 50 times in the past 500 years, the most recent of which was in 2013. Five climbers, including three German tourists were killed when ash spewed suddenly from the volcano.","Mount Mayon to experience 'hazardous eruption' within weeks .

'We think that we can develop neuroprosthetic devices that can directly interface with the hippocampus, and can restore the first type of memories we are looking at, the declarative memories.'

"The food watchdog has issued a warning about the dangers of giving unpasteurised milk to children . The food watchdog has issued a warning about giving so-called raw milk to children after five youngsters were taken to hospital with E.coli poisoning. The unpasteurised milk has become trendy among celebrity food writers and other advocates of unprocessed ‘raw food’, who claim it is both tastier and healthier. However, consumers are putting themselves at risk because the milk is not heat treated to remove dangerous bugs. The Food Standards Agency said there have been incidents on three farms selling raw milk in recent weeks which led to E.coli poisoning in five children aged one to 12 and one adult aged 28. The watchdog has now suspended sales of raw cows’ drinking milk and any product made from the milk, including cheese, at all three farms. FSA chief operating officer, Andrew Rhodes, said: ‘Older people, infants, children, pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable to food poisoning and these groups should not be consuming raw drinking milk because it hasn’t been heat treated.’ E.coli, which is found in the faeces of cows, is most likely to cause contamination during the milking process. In worst-case scenarios, the bug can cause severe diarrhoea, kidney failure – even death. In August, two children aged ten and 12, fell ill with E.coli after drinking raw milk sold by Barton Farm Dairy, an organic establishment in Barnstaple, Devon, which sells raw milk and cheeses online. The FSA has refused to name the other two farms, which are believed to have been selling milk direct to smaller groups of local customers. Raw milk has not been pasteurised by heat treatment. All fresh milk sold in the high street is pasteurised – heated to 72C (162F) for 25 seconds. As well as killing E.coli, the process also eliminates campylobacter, salmonella and listeria. Untreated raw milk is thicker with a distinctive creamy taste. But any harmful bugs on the body or udders of the cow that pass into the milk are not killed off. Cheese made from raw milk may contain these bugs. Advocates of the product argue that pasteurisation removes important nutrients, such as folic acid. They also claim raw milk is associated with reduced levels of asthma, hay fever and food allergies in children. But US tests have shown that the nutrients in raw and pasteurised milk are the same. One of these farms has been linked to E.coli poisoning of youngsters aged one, two, and five. The second farm, which is being investigated for a number of hygiene breaches and is not authorised to sell raw milk, has been linked to a food poisoning infection in a 28-year-old customer. All six became so ill that they needed hospital treatment. The FSA said it is not able to name the two farms at present because evidence is still being gathered, and there is the possibility of a prosecution for selling raw milk without permission. The sale of raw milk is banned in Scotland because of the risk to health but it is permitted in the rest of the country where farmers are allowed to sell direct to the public or over the internet. The FSA has come under enormous pressure from raw milk campaigners in recent months to liberalise the sale of the product in the high street and through vending machines. Shane Holland, of campaigning group Slow Food UK, said: ‘Data from the US show that raw milk is many thousands of times less likely to give you food poisoning than other commonly eaten foods not deemed “risky” by the FSA.’ Another supporter of raw milk is food writer Tom Parker Bowles who has described it as ‘rich, bounteous and fulsome’.

"Teachers were ordered to hand razor blades to a vulnerable youngster as part of a controversial 'controlled self-harm' policy at a specialist school, it has emerged. An investigation is underway after a child at Unsted Park School - which offers education to boys and girls aged between seven and 19 years who have Asperger's Syndrome and higher-functioning autism - was given access to blade kits. Staff were told to give the pupil access to the sterilised disposable razor and sterile wipes and escort the child to a bathroom where they would be allowed to self-harm in a 'safe and controlled manner'. An investigation is underway after a child at Unsted Park School was given access to a disposable razor . The school's principal and headteacher now face the possibility of being hauled before a Teaching Agency hearing . Teachers were ordered to wait outside the bathroom while the child was inside, checking on them every two minutes, before the wounds were dressed and cleaned by staff. The policy was introduced and abandoned within six days at the school in Munstead Park, Godalming, Surrey, and is understood to have sparked protests from staff. Principal Steve Dempsey and headteacher Laura Blair now face the possibility of being hauled before a Teaching Agency hearing over allegations of unacceptable professional conduct in connection with the policy. Members of school staff are understood to have raised fears with Surrey County Council's Local Authority Designated Officer over the procedure. Following the Teaching Agency investigation, a panel from the regulator will decide whether any further action will be taken. The regulator could decide to refer the case to a professional conduct panel. Members of school staff are understood to have raised fears with the council over the procedure (file picture) A spokesman for the Priory Group, responsible for running the school, said: 'We are always willing to review cases with the Teaching Agency. 'This was a short-term, local procedure introduced by the headteacher and school principal who genuinely believed it was in the best interests of the pupil. 'However, they accept that the procedure should not have been implemented without further approvals having been obtained from key stakeholders and senior management prior to its introduction.' It is believed the pupil's parents were aware of the policy. Unsted School was ranked good with outstanding features in its last Ofsted inspection, published in February. The report stated: 'There are robust risk assessments and health and safety processes which protect young people from harm. 'The behaviour management system at the school is outstanding. Boarders have individual behaviour plans which operate on a traffic light system and clearly identify triggers and strategies for addressing these. 'They also include work with the boarders on them developing the skills to control their own behaviour.' A spokesman for the Teaching Agency said they were unable to comment on ongoing investigations. A Surrey Police spokesman said the force was made aware of the policy in January 2012 by Social Services. The spokesman said: 'A senior strategy meeting, which was attended by Surrey Police, was held on January 19, 2012, to ensure that safeguarding practices were put in place. This was done to ensure that the practice did not continue at the school and was not put into practice at any other school. 'Surrey Police has thoroughly reviewed the matter and is satisfied that there are no criminal offences to investigate.'","Staff told to give pupil access to blades and escort them to bathroom .

"An Ohio high school pupil, expelled and jailed for a fortnight for having a penknife in his car, now fears that his dream of serving in the US army could be wrecked. Jordan Wiser’s nightmare began on December 12 last year when his car was searched by staff at Ashtabula County Technical and Career Campus in Jefferson, Ohio — about 60 miles northeast of Cleveland – following a message that he posted to his YouTube account. “The principal said he had reason to believe I had weapons in my vehicle and needed to search it,’ Wiser said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Jordan Wiser was expelled from school and spent almost a fortnight in jail because his headmaster found a knife in his paramedic uniform . ‘He made me empty out all my pockets and the vice principal grabbed me and patted me down very forcibly, he told the Huffington Post. ‘It was somewhat awkward. Then they took my car keys. I told them what was in my car and said, “Don’t be alarmed”.’ The school claims that the online message gave it ‘probable cause’ to search Wiser and his car, something that Wiser disputes. Jordan Wiser is trending more than Ukraine and the missing plane . He told FoxNews.com: ‘I declined to allow them to search myself or my car and that I wanted to talk to my lawyer or my father. They told me it wasn’t an option.’ The school found the penknife, a stun gun and two Airsoft guns. Airsoft is similar to paintball. The stun gun was for self-defence, Wiser said, adding that the penknife was part of his EMT kit. ‘My stun gun was locked in the glove box,’ Wiser told the Huffington Post, ‘and the knife was in my EMT medical vest. 'I bought it at K-Mart and have it as part of my first responder kit for cutting seat belts. Jordan Wiser has dedicated his life to public service since he was 14.

"Three women in their seventies who look decades younger have offered up their top tips for staying youthful at any age. Mimi, 75, Annette, 72, and 71-year-old Linda appeared on the Steve Harvey show yesterday, where audience members guessed that they were in their forties and fifties. Unsurprisingly, jaws dropped when their actual ages were revealed. Among their tips for maintaining a youthful appearance are getting sunshine, exercising every day, getting beauty sleep and periodically doing juice cleanses. Scroll down for video . Defying age: Three women in their seventies who look decades younger appeared on the Steve Harvey show to offer up their tips for staying youthful (left, 71-year-old Linda, and right, 75-year-old Mimi) Mimi, whose long, flowing blonde hair makes her look even younger, credits her raw vegan diet for helping her maintain her fabulous skin and figure. Having been a vegetarian for 40 years, the San Diego-based author converted to veganism six years ago and says the change eliminated her bad arthritis. Her favorite raw vegan treat is a chocolate cardamom truffle made with cashew butter and cacao butter, which is high in magnesium and minerals. What's more, the 75-year-old - whom audience members guessed was only 55 - does yoga four times a week, makes sure to get her beauty sleep, never overeats, 'laugh[s] as much as [she] can' and sometimes does a juice cleanse. In shape: Linda's passion for fitness began in her youth when she ran track and danced ballet. These days, she is a national and international bodybuilding champion and runs her own fitness studio . Healthy habits: San Diego-based author Mimi does yoga four times a week, makes sure to get her beauty sleep and follows a raw vegan diet that involves periodically doing juice cleanses . For 71-year-old Linda - who looks only 42, according to the audience - exercise has been the most important part of defying age. 'I do cardio just about every day,' she told the talk show host. 'Whether it's riding a bike or walking on a treadmill or elliptical.' 'I do cardio just about every day, whether it's riding a bike or walking on a treadmill' She even proves her impressive strength on the episode by lifting a 100lb dumbbell with a single arm - all while wearing a leopard print minidress. Her passion for fitness began in her youth when she ran track and danced ballet. These days, she is a national and international bodybuilding champion and runs her own fitness studio. Like Linda, 72-year-old Annette also believes in the health benefits of juicing, and she sometimes goes weeks without consuming solid food. Way of life: Annette, 72, also believes in the health benefits of juicing, and she sometimes goes weeks without consuming solid food. Her favorite juice recipe consists of four carrots, two apples and two red peppers . Mindful living: She stays teetotal, maintains a 'positive attitude' and gets eight miles of physical activity daily by walking everywhere and climbing up stairs . She says juicing, which she has done periodically for 45 years, gives her digestive system a rest and lets her absorb all the nutrients in fruits and vegetables, thereby upping her energy level. Her favorite juice recipe consists of four carrots, two apples and two red peppers, making for a concoction high in vitamin B. She follows up the juice with a shot of homegrown wheatgrass. Annette also stays teetotal, maintains a 'positive attitude' and gets eight miles of physical activity daily by walking everywhere and climbing up stairs. The fresh-faced Miami native, whom Steve Harvey viewers thought was just 49, also advises: 'Get enough sunshine when you can.'","Mimi, 75, Annette, 72, and 71-year-old Linda say exercising, getting enough sleep, doing juice cleanses and staying positive help them appear youthful ."
"A loyal dog refused to leave a graveside for two weeks in a remarkable display of devotion after the death of his teenage owner. After Bhaskar Shri, 18, died in a car accident, his dog Tommy went without food and water for 15 baking days and freezing nights guarding his grave in Chennai, southern India. The young construction worker had adopted the dog five years ago and the two quickly became inseparable. Then, when Bhaskar was killed in a tragic road collision the dog refused to leave him. Loyal: Tommy the dog sits by his owner's grave, where he stayed for two weeks until he was rescued . Mourning: Tommy's owner, Bhaskar Shri, was killed in a road accident on August 2 . Dawn Williams, an animal rescue officer working with the non-profit Blue Cross of India finally rescued the famished dog after he endured more than a fortnight in the open. She said: ‘I first spotted the brown dog sitting on a fresh grave one evening as I happen to walk past in the first week of August, but at the time I didn’t think anything of it. ‘But on August 13 I was in the area again while on a different rescue mission and saw him again. He was sitting in the same spot in the same position. 'It looked like he hadn’t moved for weeks.’ The dog seemed troubled, even apparently having tears in his eyes as she approached him, Ms Williams said. 'I could see he was in a disturbed condition. He was famished and I’m certain he had tears in his eyes,' she said. 'I gave him water and biscuits but he refused to move. Then, with my teammates, I walked around the area and asked locals if they knew the dog. 'They told me the dog was called Tommy and he was guarding his owner’s grave.’ Inseparable: Bhaskar, who was 18, adopted Tommy five years ago, and they were always together . Enduring: An animal rescue officer from the Blue Cross of India believes Tommy was there for two weeks . Ms Williams finally managed to track down Bhaskar’s mother, Shrimati Sundari, also a construction worker. She added: ‘When Tommy saw her; he jumped on her and was licking her before he rested his face on her feet. It was obvious he knew her.' Ms Sundari told Ms Williams her son and Tommy were always together, even at the construction sites. But after the car accident on August 2 Tommy had disappeared. She thought he’d found another home. ‘She was really happy he was back. She called him a loyal friend and she would keep him as a reminder of her son,' said Ms Williams. 'It was quite sad seeing them walk off together. But I was glad they were reunited. I’m sure Tommy will help Shrimati with her grief, dogs are amazing in times of emotion.’","Bhaskar Shri adopted Tommy five years ago and the pair were inseparable .

"Gerald Howarth said Enoch Powell had been right to warn that mass movement of ‘non Christian’ migrants to Britain would cause problems . A veteran Tory MP has claimed controversial ‘rivers of blood’ MP Enoch Powell was right to warn against immigration. Gerald Howarth said the notorious Conservative MP had been correct to warn that mass movement of ‘non Christian’ migrants to Britain would cause problems. His comments were made in an email to a constituent about the Islamist 'Trojan Horse' plot in Birmingham to radicalise school children by taking over governing boards. In the leaked letter the former defence minister wrote: ‘Clearly, the arrival of so many people of non-Christian faith has presented a challenge, as so many of us, including the late Enoch Powell, warned decades ago. ‘Recent events have illustrated that some of these new arrivals have a very different ethos from traditional Christian schools and we are right to intervene to prevent them from teaching divisive ideology to children born here.’ Mr Howarth tonight confirmed that the leaked letter was 'entirely accurate' and reflected his views about the dangers of immigration. He told MailOnline: 'I feel very strongly about this and what's happening in Rotherham is devastating. It is decades of political correctness and it's allowed this disgusting abuse of children to take place. 'It's the Labour party who are responsible. The Labour party and the left.' He said England was now 'fighting back' against political correctness. He added: 'This is the United Kingdom for goodness sake - if you don't like it go and live somewhere else.' Sir Gerald said the problem with immigration was about 'numbers', which he said 'Enoch always said'. Enoch Powell’s notorious ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech was delivered in Birmingham in April 1968, sparking widespread condemnation. In the speech Mr Powell called for the ‘repatriation’ of non-white immigrants, claiming the racial mix in Britain would lead to city riots. Sir Gerald did not advocate repatriation in the leaked email to his constituent. Mr Powell was immediately sacked from the Conservative shadow cabinet by the party’s then leader Edward Heath. Enoch Powell, the late Tory MP, sparked widespread anger after attacking migration in a 1968 speech on race relations . In 2007, the Tory candidate in the West Midlands seat of Halesowen, Nigel Hastilow, resigned after writing a newspaper article in which he said that Mr Powell was right. Mr Howarth is the MP for Aldershot and was a defence minister between 2010 and 2012. He was knighted in 2012.

"On one of her regular visits to her mother’s care home, Claudette Watson noticed something wasn’t right. Her mother Maud Sappleton, 71, suffered from Alzheimer’s and had moved into the home five months earlier. Despite her dementia, when Maud went to Seabrooke Manor Residential and Nursing Home in Ilford, Essex, in May 2010, she was still a lively woman, enjoying a joke with her family. Crucially, she was also able to walk around quite freely. Bed sores can be the result of nursing care provided by unqualified staff, who may fail to recognise or report signs of potentially serious skin problems, say experts . Within a few months, however, the former nursing assistant had lost mobility. By October, she spent most of her time in a chair and, although her children didn’t initially know it, was suffering from at least one bed sore (also known as a pressure sore or pressure ulcer). By November, she was largely bedridden, and her limbs were very stiff. ‘My brother and I didn’t make the connection at the time, but I’d noticed an odour like rotting flesh,’ says Claudette, 54, a charity chief executive from Woolwich, South London. ‘We wondered if they were washing her properly, but when we brought it up with the staff, they said it was nothing. ‘Eventually, they told us she had a “sore”, but they’d been looking at it.’ Then in early January, Maud was moved from the residential side of the building to the nursing unit, where she was found to have a number of grade-four bed sores — the most severe kind — on her left hip, right hip and buttocks. Her condition continued to deteriorate, and she was admitted to hospital suffering kidney failure, and sepsis (blood poisoning), related to the bed sores. She died on  March 3, 2011, with seven bed sores, including two grade three, and one grade four. Seabrooke Manor Residential and Nursing Home, pictured: Despite her dementia, when Maud went to the nursing home she was still a lively woman . Bed sores occur when a patient lies immobile for a period of time, unable to get up and move around or shift their weight. The pressure disrupts the flow of . blood through the skin, so it becomes starved of oxygen and nutrients . and begins to break down, leading to an ulcer forming. These are often . found on the heel, back and elbows. There . are four grades: a reddening or bruising of the skin is classed as . grade one; broken skin and shallow ulceration, grade two; and large, . deep ulceration, grade three. Grade . four ulcers are so deep that in many cases the skin and muscle has . completely worn away, revealing bone, and sometimes internal organs. The . most severe ulcers are very difficult to heal and can lead to a fatal . infection or life-threatening complications such as gangrene or blood . poisoning. Experienced nursing staff: Guidelines from the National Institute for health and Care Excellence say any patient considered at risk of bed sores should be turned regularly and put on a specially designed foam or electrically powered air mattress (posed by model) Some 540 hospital patients and 227 care home residents’ deaths had bed sores as a contributing factor in 2011, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics, while bed sores were also the main cause of death for another 78 hospital patients (and 39 care home residents) that year. Even when the sores don’t kill the patient, they can cause terrible pain, and lead to immobility. ‘Pressure sores acquired in care homes or hospitals of grade three or four are preventable through good, basic nursing care,’ says Peter Walsh, chief executive of  the Action Against Medical Accidents charity. This means regularly ‘turning’ the patient.  An estimated half a million people in the UK develop bed sores each year. And shocking new figures from the NHS show that one in 20 patients has them. The statistics were based on data collected from nearly 200,000 patients in July this year (most of these were in hospital, a small proportion in residential care homes and nursing homes). ‘It’s quite scandalous that bed sores are being allowed to happen at such an alarming rate,’ says Mr Walsh. ‘The cost in pain and misery and the cost to the NHS in treatment are enormous and it’s a sign of neglectful care and under-staffing.’ Bed sores are estimated to cost the NHS up to £2 billion a year in care costs. To tackle the problem, it was announced last year the sores would be included in a list of 60 ‘patient outcome measures’ used to assess quality of care — with hospitals losing some of their budget if they fail to meet targets. The Department of Health points out that the shocking new data is actually an improvement, with a smaller proportion (5.1 per cent) of patients suffering bed sores in July, compared with the  7 per cent affected in April, 2012. But Jane Nixon, professor of tissue viability at the University of Leeds and a leading researcher on the subject, says while the NHS focus on bed sore prevention has had a big impact, the data is not reliable. ‘There’s no standard methodology in the way it is collected. The requirements vary between trusts and the methods have changed over time,’ she says. Professor Nixon says some trusts only report the number of patients with sores visited by district nurses on the one day the data is meant to be collected. This means the number of patients with pressure ulcers reported each month is not reliable. There has also been a trend in reclassifying pressure ulcers as ‘incontinence lesions’ or if they’re on the heel, diabetic foot ulcers, to keep figures down. One factor that can lead to bed sores, says Professor Nixon, is that a lot of basic nursing care is provided by unqualified staff, who may fail to recognise or report signs of potentially serious skin problems. The cost of bed sores on the NHS: It was announced last year the sores would be included in a list of 60 'patient outcome measures' used to assess quality of care - with hospitals losing some of their budget if they fail to meet targets (posed by model) Some 540 hospital patients and 227 care home residents' deaths had bed sores as a contributing factor in 2011, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics . Guidelines from the National Institute for health and Care Excellence (NICE) say any patient considered at risk of bed sores is meant to be turned regularly and put on a specially designed foam or electrically powered air mattress. But Professor Nixon says the existence of these mattresses can mean people think there’s no need to turn a patient using them. A post-mortem report registered Maud’s bed sores and dementia as secondary causes of death — the primary cause was pneumonia. A council investigation found the home failed in its duty of care towards her. It noted that despite her being assessed upon admission as being at risk of developing the sores, no plan was carried out to keep Maud’s skin healthy. Owner Bupa care homes settled with Maud’s family out of court, admitting it had breached its duty of care. It agreed to pay £20,000 compensation plus legal costs. According to Ruth Hewitt, solicitor and medical negligence specialist at Bolt Burdon Kemp, the law firm who handled Claudette’s claim, bed sores are one of the most common types of medical negligence cases. ‘Most serious pressure sores should be avoidable and it is inexcusable that Mrs Sappleton was found to be suffering with so many at the time of her death,’ she says. ‘A main issue seems to be a lack of training, which meant staff at the home wrongly diagnosed her skin condition [as a skin tear] and failed to put in place a skin integrity plan at an early stage, which might have prevented her condition from worsening.’ Claudette says: ‘Putting a plan in place to prevent a patient at risk of developing bed sores seems a very simple thing to do. To not do that and then have these things develop is very upsetting.’ She adds: ‘Bupa is a good name, associated with quality care, so it sticks in your throat when things like this occur. While the NHS focus on bed sore prevention has had a big impact, the data is not reliable, according to Jane Nixon, professor of tissue viability at the University of Leeds. There's no standard methodology in the way the information is collected. Requirements vary between trusts and the methods have changed over time (picture posed by model) ‘When you suffer from Alzheimer’s you can’t communicate well so I’m sure there was a lot of pain there, which is heartbreaking.’ Richard Jackson, operations director for Bupa Care Services, said: ‘Mrs Sappleton was unwell when she was admitted to our residential unit in 2010 and we transferred her into our nursing unit for increased care and support. Unfortunately, her health deteriorated further and faster than we expected. ‘We fully accept that we did not transfer her to the nursing unit as quickly as we should have done and, on this occasion, we did not provide the high standard of care to Mrs Sappleton that we all expect. ‘I would like to again apologise to Mrs Sappleton’s family and would also like to reassure them we took immediate action by commissioning a full investigation into the home. ‘Following that, we retrained our people and now carry out six-monthly refresher training on skin care and moving vulnerable people, to prevent pressure ulcers.’","Maud Sappleton, 71, entered Seabrooke Manor Residential and Nursing Home in Ilford, Essex, a lively woman .

"A Harvard senior and statistics whiz who uses a mathematical model to predict an Oscar nominees chance of winning - and has a 75 percent success rate from previous years - has delivered his forecast for 2015. Ben Zauzmer - who predicted all eight categories at the 2012 Academy Awards, including Meryl Streep for best actress for The Iron Lady in 2012 - applies information such as Rotten Tomatoes reviews and Golden Globes wins to a formula to determine the chances of an actor or film winning. And this year's victors? Zauzmer told The Boston Globe he believes Birdman will take best picture, Eddie Redmayne will win best actor for The Theory of Everything, and Julianne Moore will take best actress for Still Alice. The most certain of those, Zauzmer contends, is Moore, who has a 84.4 percent chance of winning. Scroll down for videos . Her year: Julianne Moore, who has been nominated for an Oscar five times but never won, seems certain to take home a best actress trophy this year for Still Alice, based on the predictions of a Harvard math whiz . Landslide: The prediction puts Moore way ahead of any of her competition, with a 84.4 percent chance to win . Harvard: Ben Zauzmer  applies information such as Rotten Tomatoes reviews and wins from other awards ceremonies to a formula to determine the chances of an actor or film winning at the Oscars . She has been nominated five times but is yet to win. Redmayne's chances are just as close, with 77.1 percent. His closest competition was Michael Keaton for Birdman, who registered a 13.8 percent chance of winning. 'The three best predictors for the two top acting categories are the SAGs, the Golden Globes (drama), and the BAFTAs,' Zauzmer told The Boston Globe of his formula. 'Eddie Redmayne won all three for The Theory of Everything. 'It’s possible that Michael Keaton wins but, make no mistake, that would be a mathematical upset.' Just a theory: Zauzmer predicts Eddie Redmayne will take best actor for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything . Critically acclaimed: Michael Keaton may be this year's comeback success story, but he will not take the best actor gong, Zauzmer predicts . Birdman has a 39.9 percent chance of taking best picture, with Boyhood sitting behind it on 21.8 percent. Zauzmer says all indications say this a 'two-horse race' and that the competition - The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Imitation Game, American Sniper, Whiplash, The Theory of Everything and Selma - stand little chance. Birdman also has a 55.6 percent of winning best director for Alejandro Inarritu. However the critics favorite in that category is Richard Linklater for Boyhood. When it comes to best supporting actor, Zauzmer says J.K Simmons is a shoe-in for Whiplash, with 84.7 percent. Shoe-ins: Both J.K. Simmons, for Whiplash, and Patricia Arquette, for Boyhood, will will best supporting actor and actress respectively, Zauzmer said. They are seen here winning the categories at the BAFTA awards . '(Simmons) will run away with the Oscar,' Zauzmer predicts. Similarly, Patricia Arquette is expected to win best supporting actress for Boyhood, with 82.2 percent. Birdman is predicted to win best original screenplay (44.3 percent), while The Imitation Game should win best adapted screenplay (66.3 percent). How To Train Your Dragon 2 is the odds-on favorite for best animated feature, with 45.6 percent. While Interstellar is the favorite for best visual effects, with 50.5 percent, Birdman trumped the predictions for best cinematography with 38.6 percent. Citizenfour, the gripping inside look at the Edward Snowden whistle-blower saga, is expected to win best documentary, with 42.4 percent.

"David Cameron today warned that Scotland would be more at risk from terrorism if it votes for independence. The Prime Minister said the United Kingdom had the best security and intelligence services in the world to keep people safe. He said the safety of staying together in a ‘very dangerous and insecure world’ was one of the ‘strongest arguments’ against separation. Scroll down for video . Mr Cameron, speaking at the end of the two-day Nato conference in Wales, said: ‘I don’t think anyone can be in any doubt we live in a very dangerous and insecure world. ‘I would have thought one of the strongest arguments that those of us who want to see the United Kingdom stay together can make is in that dangerous world and insecure world of terrorist threats and other threats isn’t it better to be part of the United Kingdom?’ He said the UK ‘has a top five defence budget, that has some of the best security and intelligence services anywhere in the world, that is part of every single alliance that really matters in the world in terms of Nato, the G8, the G20 European Union, a permanent member of the Security Council of the UN’. Mr Cameron added: ‘To have all those networks and abilities to work with allies to keep us safe, isn’t it better to have those things than to separate yourselves from them. ‘Those are some of the arguments we will be making in the weeks to come before this vital vote.’ Mr Cameron's remarks came after the former Prime Minister Gordon Brown vowed to lead a campaign for more powers for Scotland if it rejects independence in this month’s referendum. The former prime minister, signalling his return to front line politics, said he would push for further devolution within weeks of the September 18 vote. Mr Brown is among senior Labour figures being deployed in a final push by the party to prevent its supporters being won over by the Scottish National Party. With polls suggesting a late swing towards the Yes camp, Mr Brown urged voters not to ‘abandon’ the huge value to Scotland of pooling resources with the rest of the UK in areas such as pensions and healthcare. He told an audience of activists and politicians at Westminster that he had asked Speaker John Bercow to allow him to lead a debate when the Commons resumes business in October to galvanise cross-party support for reforms. A pledge of extra tax and legal powers for Holyrood in the event of a rejection of independence in the popular vote has been signed by the leaders of all three main Westminster parties. Gordon Brown (left) spoke in London today ahead of the forthcoming Scottish vote for independence on September 18 . Mr Brown said the aim should be the ‘maximum local decision-making powers that is possible’ while maintaining the union. ‘The status quo is not now an option. A no vote does not mean no change.’ He said: ‘A no vote will usher in the further constitutional reforms in social, economic and fiscal affairs and a no vote will mean the choice you have made is against separation but for further devolution to the Scottish Parliament. ‘Over the next few months after the referendum, we can take the lead in ensuring that these powers - that the Conservatives and Liberals say they would support - can be implemented as quickly as possible. ‘I have asked the Speaker that when Parliament returns after the referendum in October, that in the first week he allows me to lead a debate about how we can secure the timetable and the delivery of the further devolution proposals. SNP leader Alex Salmond was canvassing in Peterhead fish market today . ‘This is not like 1979 when the then-Conservative government promised change and then denied us it. This is like 1997 when the Labour government came in and, within a year, had delivered its promise of a Scottish parliament. ‘When we are talking about the future of the constitution, London must and will change, Westminster must and will change, and, of course, the United Kingdom must and will change.’ He told the meeting - hosted by Blairite pressure group Progress - that the No camp ‘will accept whatever result comes our way’. ‘But the Scottish National Party have got to recognise that if they lose this ... we have got to get back to the issues of improving public services. ‘I think the Conservatives will have to accept these proposals ... the strong weight of opinion for them. ‘We stand ready to talk to other parties about how we could reach a consensus on these proposals for the future.’ Mr Brown said the UK was a uniquely successful arrangement anywhere in the world. It offered pooled resources across four nations ‘to guarantee to anyone no matter where they are in any part of the United Kingdom that they have the same right to healthcare, to help when unemployed, to dignity in retirement and, of course, to dignity and support when they are sick, disabled or vulnerable. ‘That is a principle that we should never abandon.’ He dismissed SNP plans for a corporation tax cut as ‘the Scots Nats backing the fat cats and obviously cheered on by the cybernats’. He also dismissed the level of demand for an English parliament. ‘The English do not want a parliament of their own. If they wanted it, that would be an issue, but there is no evidence that there is a desire for an English parliament,’ he said. ‘We have got to recognise the assymetric nature of the British constitution, find a way of accommodating the ambitions of all the different nations - and indeed the regions.’","PM said the UK had the best security and intelligence services in the world .

"Campaigners have pleaded with Nigel Farage to stay away from Scotland after he announced plans to hold a pro-union rally a few days before the referendum. The Ukip leader wants to open a new front in the campaign against Scottish independence, but his plan to address supporters in Glasgow next Friday, six days before the vote, has caused consternation among the established Better Together allies. Mr Farage’s campaign appearances in Scotland have previously attracted large protests. In May last year he had to be escorted away under police protection after he was trapped in a pub in Edinburgh by an angry mob chanting, ‘Scum, scum, scum’. Scroll down for video . Trapped: Ukip leader Nigel Farage needed a police escort to protect him from a mob in Edinburgh following a press conference in a pub to promote his candidate for a by-election in Aberdeen . When he last visited Scotland during the European election campaign in May this year scores of policemen and vans were on hand in the capital to contain hundreds of protesters. Pro-union campaigners are concerned that Mr Farage’s visit to Glasgow, which has become the key battleground city, will put off traditional Labour voters, who are seen as crucial to securing a No vote. The event is also likely to overshadow a rally planned by Labour on the same day in the city, which will see leader Ed Miliband share a platform with former prime minister Gordon Brown for the first time since Mr Brown left Downing Street in 2010. Strategists had hoped the joint event would help revive the floundering No campaign. Speculation is growing that a poll this weekend will show a significant Yes lead for the first time at a crucial time in the campaign. Last night, Murdo Fraser, a Tory member of the Scottish Parliament, said: ‘I think it would be best if Nigel Farage stayed as far away from Scotland as possible. The arguments for staying in the UK are strong. The majority of Scots are on our side and we don’t need a distraction at this point.’ But Ukip’s Scottish chairman, Arthur Thackeray, dismissed calls for Mr Farage to stay away as ‘absolute, complete and utter nonsense’. He said: ‘We are a mainstream party and Nigel as our leader is coming up in support of a No vote.’ Earlier this week, Mr Farage described the efforts to save the 300-year-old union as ‘very lame’. Asked about his planned rally, he said: ‘I’ve no doubt I’m in for a rough .

"A football club captain died aged 27 after he suffered a fatal stroke triggered by heading the ball too often. 'Talented' striker Bryan Herbert was a hero among his teammates for his prolific scoresheet and 'man of the match awards'. But he collapsed just hours after setting up a match-winning goal for his team - Bacup Borough Football Club in Bacup, Lancashire - and died in hospital eight weeks later. An inquest was told a blood clot on his brain had been caused by footballs regularly clashing with his skull as he went in for headers, which in turn caused the fatal stroke. Bryan Herbert, pictured with his girlfriend (right), felt sickly after matches and complained of a headache - but did not realise he had a blood clot . Keen footballer Bryan Herbert (left with Stackesteads St Josephs assistant manager Darren Green) had no idea that he was suffering from a life-threatening blood-clot . The coroner heard the chef had complained to his girlfriend of a headache in August last year and he collapsed shortly afterwards. The centre forward player was rushed to hospital but died in October with his girlfriend Vicky Bruty and the rest of his family at his bedside. The fatal seizure happened as the couple were about to to jet off on a summer holiday to together to Zante in Greece. After his death the club published a match programme dedicated to Bryan with his picture on the front page and numerous tributes inside. After a coroner recorded a verdict of natural causes, teaching assistant Vicky, 25, said: 'Bryan lived for his football and now it looks like he died for his football. 'Obviously Brian's death has turned my life upside down. After the holiday we were planning on starting our life together and starting a family. The football caption (pictured with girlfriend Vicky Bruty) began to feel unwell in August last year, before losing the power of speech and screaming in agony . The footballer for Bacup Borough Football Club, who was regularly awarded man of the match, was adored by teammates and supporters . 'He did used to complain to me of headaches but someone else can never know as to what degree of pain they were - and he was a typical lad and didn't go to the doctors. 'On the day before we were due to go out on holiday he seemed fine and was talking of how much we were looking forward to it. But the following morning he woke complaining a headache and was joking that he hoped it would not ruin the holiday. 'He said ""I hope I don't feel like this on the plane"". 'But at about 8am he said he was feeling a lot worse and said he couldn't move. 'He was screaming out in pain then he stopped being able to talk so we called an ambulance. Then it was just a whirlwind and he had the stroke. 'Even though he hadn't been able to talk again, he started laughing and was able to move part of his arms and was aware of what was going on around him. We thought he was going to get better. 'I went with him in the ambulance and then his speech went in the ambulance and he never spoke again. 'It was heartbreaking watching him go like that and I couldn't take it in. I was with him every day. Bryan Herbert's mother Alicia heard the tragic details at the inquest . His heartbroken father Gary said he had never expected to outlive his child . His girlfriend Vicky said he had not gone to the doctors with his headache . A memorial programme by Bacup Borough FC honoured their captain who spent eight weeks in hospital before he died . The chef suffered a blood clot in a vital artery which had prevented blood flow to the brain . 'We now have to take each day as it comes and it makes you realise how precious life is. It came as such a shock.' Bryan, a lifelong Liverpool fan, played for Bacup Junior's side at 12 before progressing to the seniors at 16. He also played for another amateur squad Stacksteads St Josephs and was captain for a local pub team. He regularly featured in local newspaper sports reports about his goal scoring feats and often notched up to five goals in a single game and helped win several trophies. After hit a winning trail in the Burnley and District Boys League one local newspaper report began: 'There's only one Bryan Herbert.' While he was in hospital, the skipper's teammates hung banners urging him to get better - but he died with his grirfriend and the rest of his family at his bedside . Bryan's mother Alicia Herbert told the inquest that her son had suffered from headaches previously - and six weeks prior to the stroke had come home from football 'feeling sickly'. An ambulance was called but she told the inquest that the headache had passed and he was feeling better. Tragedy struck last August after he was appointed skipper at Stacksteads. He suffered a blood clot in a vital artery which had prevented blood flow to the brain. His team mates hung banners in the ward by team-mates saying: 'We need our skipper back', but he died in October at the Blackburn Royal Hospital. The Blackburn hearing was told there . was no missed opportunity to help Bryan and nothing could have been done . differently in his treatment. Mrs Herbert told the inquest: 'We got eight weeks with him, it was a shock and we were told we needed to pray for a miracle.' Bryan, who began playing football for Bacup Borough Juniors when he was 12, played centre forward three or four times a week . After examination of the brain, a neuropathologist concluded that there had been a blood clot in the brain that could have been caused by high blood pressure - or trauma such as whiplash or a sudden jerk causing the vessel to break. The pathologist said: 'Getting a clot at that young age is not a common phenomenon.' After the inquest Bryan's father Gary said: 'You don't expect to outlive your child. 'He was a talented footballer and played centre forward, playing three or four times a week. His team will be holding tribute matches to him each year in his memory.' Bacup manager Brent Peters said: 'I am shocked and deeply upset by the death of Bryan. He loved his football, he was quick with a good eye for goal. 'Bryan was fully committed be it a training game or a fully fledged official game. His commitment, his enthusiasm, his determination could never be questioned. 'Bryan Herbert's legacy will always remain with me and Bacup Borough Football Club. There is a big void left that will never be filled. 'Bryan Herbert will be a sad loss to not only his close family but his football family.' Coroner Michael Singelton said: 'It is unbelievable that somebody who was so fit and healthy and an active sportsman that something could happen that is so catastrophic. 'It is almost unbelievable and one of the things that my job tells me is that you can take nothing for granted in life. You don't know what is around the corner and everyday is precious. 'As a parent myself I can't begin to imagine the trauma you and the family have had, seeing Bryan this very fit, active young man reduced to this, in circumstances where doctors are unable to do anything.' The blood clot in Bryan's . brain could have been caused by high blood pressure - or trauma . such as whiplash or a sudden jerk causing a blood vessel to break. One theory is that every time the ball hits the head, the blood vessel . walls become less stiff and weakens so they expand, like a garden hose that . becomes fatter as it ages. Research published this week suggests that repeated, sub-concussive hits . to the head are dangerous and are also linked to neurological disorders . such as multiple sclerosis later in life. Scientists from the University of Rochester Medical Center say that the . brain degeneration observed among professional football players may be due . to something in their immune system spiralling out of control. This could be because it damages the blood-brain barrier - a 'gate' between the brain and bloodstream. When the barrier . is working properly, it holds in proteins and molecules that bathe the . brain and protect it from foreign substances. With blows to the head, however, the barrier opens slightly and allows . some proteins to leak into the bloodstream and possibly attack the . brain. And just last week, researchers at the University of Texas warned that heading a football could cause brain damage. They said that a header is classed as a 'minor sub-concussive blow' and . have found that young people who play football are less able to perform . tasks requiring basic thinking skills than those who avoid the game.","Bryan Herbert had a clot caused by footballs regularly clashing with his skull .

"Pupils at one secondary school in Britain will undergo fitness training every day in an effort to tackle childhood obesity. Students will be taught to squat when picking up a football and lunge when tying up shoelaces so that a positive relationship with exercise is fostered - even in children who don't like sport. Ashwell Academy, in Hull, East Yorkshire, will become the first to introduce a specially-designed anti-obesity programme into its curriculum. Pupils at one British secondary school will undergo fitness training every day as part of a new independent programme which aims to tackle childhood obesity . From January next year, students will spend a total of three and a half hours per week doing some form of physical exercise - 75 per cent more than the national average. The frequency of PE lessons will increase from one per week to daily activities with pupils performing exercises such as squats, press-ups, lunges and burpees. Pupils who buy school dinners will also be encouraged to plump for a healthier option that contains less fat, salt and additives in an attempt to tackle Britain's £5.1 billion epidemic. The news comes after doctors recently called for an emergency taskforce to be set up to tackle childhood obesity. They warned that an entire generation will be 'destroyed' by a diet of junk food and sugary drinks unless urgent action is taken. In an open letter to the Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Dame Sally Davies, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and 11 partner organisations said a national Child Obesity Action Group (COAG) should be formed as 'a matter of urgency'. It has been devised with a view of helping teachers to incorporate simple but more structured fitness training into and around traditional, curriculum-based PE lessons. Pupils are taught to squat, for example, and encouraged to do so when picking-up a football. This is more beneficial to the leg and back muscles than simply bending-over from the hip. They are also taught to twist correctly when playing netball, and to lunge when tying their shoelaces. The exercises are said to be particularly effective because they are also used everyday school life - when picking up a pen, for instance. This means that youngsters who do not have an active interest in sport or PE still benefit from basic fitness. Latest figures show many children are already obese by the time they reach secondary school. Almost a third of 10 to 11-year-olds and more than a fifth of four to five-year-olds were overweight or obese. Today's independent  initiative to introduce daily exercise in schools, called the Schools and National Anti-Obesity Program (SNAP), will be incorporated into the Academy's curriculum on January 6, 2015, and will run for a trial period of six weeks. If this is a success then the program will continue until 2018. Its aim - to fight childhood obesity and support pupils' wellbeing by giving them a 'positive and purposeful experience' with exercise - is nothing new. But unlike existing schemes, SNAP is designed to be integrated into the curriculum, rather than run in conjunction with it. If the trial at Ashwell Academy is successful, SNAP looks set to roll out in schools across the UK next year. Other schools, including Headington, an exclusive girl's school in Oxford, and Longhill Primary School in Hull, East Yorks., have already expressed an interest. Mike Birkinshaw, headteacher at Ashwell Academy, said: 'We are keen to introduce a better standard of physical education into our curriculum while being aware that our students' health and wellbeing generally should also remain a priority. 'We have already introduced healthier lunch options to tackle obesity, but it isn't enough by itself. 'Children need to be more active as inactivity results in obesity and other health issues that can continue into adulthood. 'As a school we feel that we have a duty of care to do all we can to safeguard our pupils against the growing problem of childhood obesity and believe that SNAP will align perfectly with our aims.' According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), childhood obesity is one of the most 'serious public health challenges of the 21st Century'. Pupils who buy school dinners will be encouraged to go for healthier options with less fat, salt and additives . In the UK, almost a third of 10 to 11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4 to 5 year olds are either obese or overweight, according to figures from the National Child Measurement Programme 2012/13. But despite obesity being largely preventable, SNAP's creator, Daniel Fallon says schools have been 'generally unaware' of the 'straightforward' measures that can be put in place to curb it at a grassroots level. Mr Fallon, a recently retired Navy Petty Officer, drew on his 13 years as a fitness instructor and clinical exercise specialist to create a program specifically designed for schools. It has been devised with a view of helping teachers to incorporate simple but more structured fitness training into and around traditional, curriculum-based PE lessons. The news comes after doctors recently called for an emergency taskforce to be set up to tackle childhood obesity. They warned that an entire generation will be 'destroyed' by a diet of junk food and sugary drinks unless urgent action is taken. In an open letter to the Chief Medical Officer for England sent in September, Professor Dame Sally Davies, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and 11 partner organisations said a national Child Obesity Action Group (COAG) should be formed as 'a matter of urgency'. Latest figures show many children are already obese by the time they reach secondary school. 18.9 per cent of children in Year 6 aged 10 to 11 were obese and a further 14.4 per cent were overweight. Of the children in Reception aged four to five, latest figures suggest 9.3 per cent were obese and another 13.0 per cent were overweight. In total almost a third of 10 to 11-year-olds and more than a fifth of four to five-year-olds were overweight or obese. Pupils are taught to squat, for example, and encouraged to do so when picking-up a football. This is more beneficial to the leg and back muscles than simply bending-over from the hip. They are also taught to twist correctly when playing netball, and to lunge when tying their shoelaces. The exercises are said to be particularly effective because they are also used everyday school life - when picking up a pen, for instance. This means that youngsters who do not have an active interest in sport or PE still benefit from basic fitness. SNAP - described as a world first - is sold on licence, and affiliate schools receive training workshops for teachers and teaching assistants, instructional handbooks, illustrated text books for students, and video support. Schools are then free to integrate SNAP's recommendations as they see fit. Hull's Ashwell Academy, which specialises in behavioural difficulties, is the first school to sign up to carry out SNAP. According to NHS figures, 19 per cent of children in East Yorkshire and Northern Lincolnshire are obese or 'dangerously overweight'. Headteacher Mike Birkinshaw added: 'SNAP offers a stimulating and fun way to increase the frequency - and, by a small margin, the length - of physical education classes and engage with young people regardless of whether they are into sports or not. 'We look forward to trialling the programme in January 2015 and based on the pupil feedback and results, incorporating it into our curriculum on a long-term basis.' Mr Fallon, SNAP's creator, completed three tours of duty in the Middle East, Africa and Mediterranean before retiring from the Navy  last month. He said: 'It is a widely reported fact that there is concern about the state of PE in schools, however there has not been a credible and cost-effective alternative to existing curriculum guidelines. 'SNAP isn't about transforming schools into boot camps, but rather a method of introducing simple and straightforward exercises into school's current PE lessons.'

"From coffee to cigarettes, many of us have addictions. But one woman is so addicted to cat food that she gorges on a staggering 900 kitty treats every single day. Mary, 46, from Farwell, Michigan, began binging on the treats following a difficult divorce. Scroll down for video . Mary is so addicted to cat food that she eats 900 kitty treats every single day . After the breakdown of her marriage, Mary (she does not reveal her surname in the programme) spent much of her time sitting around at home with her three cats and was tempted into trying a treat. What started as an innocent urge to sample the cat food led to an addiction after Mary was left instantly hooked. Her addiction began after she suffered a difficult divorce and spent much of her time alone with just her three cats . Mary spends a staggering amount of money of treats for herself every month and says they make her mouth water . 'They just burst with flavour in your mouth and I love them' she said during an interview on My Strange Addiction, which premieres on Discovery Real Time tonight. 'When I start thinking about a certain flavour of cat treat, my mouth will water,' she said. In the programme, Mary showcases a variety of her favourite flavours from treats with a cheesy centre to beefy flavoured biscuits that she awards '10 out of 10 for crunch factor'. Speaking on the show, Mary's brother Tommy said: 'It's gross. There are four basic food groups and cat food is not one of them.' Mary's brother Tommy says it is not healthy to eat the cat treats but Mary is addicted . Unemployed Mary spends $200 (£125) on cat food for herself every month, which she admits is more than she spends on human food. She is sure to always keep a stash of the goodies in her car, purse and by her bedside table for late-night munchies, and she says she will even gorge on cat food at the expense of what she calls 'people food.' 'There have been days when I eat treats all day long and no people food,' she says. 'The cabinet just calls my name: ""Mary come eat"" and I will go sit on the deck and snack.' ‘My Strange Addiction’ premieres on Discovery Real Time on Tuesdays at 9.00pm and 9.30pm .",Mary from Michigan gorges on cat biscuits after getting hooked at first taste .
"Green deal: Huhne claimed that prices will be £94 per year lower than if the Government didn't intervene . Families will pay £280 a year in ‘green taxes’ by 2020 to fund the shift to wind, solar and nuclear power, ministers  admitted yesterday. The huge cost faced by ordinary people will pay for the Government’s pledge to cut carbon emissions and be ‘the greenest ever’. Households currently pay £89 a year on their bills for the green energy drive, but this will increase every year to reach £280 by 2020, according to the Government’s Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC). The ‘taxes’ will provide almost £8billion a year towards the £200billion cost of vast wind farms, nuclear power stations, a new pylon network, and to put up solar panels. But in a bizarre statement, energy and climate change secretary Chris Huhne told the House of Commons that his policies mean  consumers will actually be better off. He said: ‘By 2020, we expect household bills to be 7 per cent – or £94 – lower than they would otherwise be without our policies. ‘Britain’s homes will be cheaper to heat and light than if we did nothing.’ His claim is based on a controversial assumption that families will make vast reductions in their electricity and gas bills by 2020 – wiping out the £280 in green taxes. It also assumes there will be a large uptake of government-backed schemes for insulation projects. The revelation threatens to spark a revolt from consumers, who are suffering the biggest and longest squeeze on living standards in more than 60 years. In addition, Chancellor George Osborne is under pressure to over-rule Mr Huhne and halt the rush to green energy in a bid to protect British industry. Price rises: Gas bills are set to increase by £80 to £90 by 2020 regardless of any Government intervention . The fear is that manufacturers and other businesses will be saddled with huge levies on energy bills, pushing up costs and threatening their ability to sell goods around the world. The details were revealed in the small print in DECC documents. The current average annual energy bill is around £1,200. DECC said the figure would be £1,379 by 2020 without any government measures to drive a switch to green and nuclear power. It claimed the figure would be £1,285 based on the impact of its green taxes and associated policies to cut household energy use and curb wholesale prices. However, a DECC source admitted this lower figure would be possible only if households slashed electricity use by a third (from 4.5 to 3 megawatt hours a year) and gas by 6 per cent. The Government has a target of providing 20 per cent of the UK’s electricity from renewable sources by 2020. Despite the £280 price tag of government policies, Mr Huhne insisted rising fossil fuel prices rather than green taxes were to blame for higher energy bills. He said: ‘I want to insulate Britain’s homes not just from the cold weather, but also from the chill winds of global fossil fuel prices. It’s these that are pushing up consumer energy prices. ‘We will secure our energy at the lowest cost: in the short term by promoting competition; in the medium term by insulating our homes and in the long term by steering us away from excessive reliance on fossil fuels and on to clean, green and secure energy.’ But Dr Benny Peiser, of the Global Warming Foundation, said Mr Huhne’s reassurances were ‘political spin’. Political spin: Dr Benny Peiser said that the statement that bills will fall was based on guesswork rather than any sound economic facts . ‘All analysis by City banks and others make clear that current government policy will lead to big increases in energy bills,’ he said. ‘The energy-use reductions being assumed by the Government to justify the claim that bills will fall are not based on any sound economic facts. They are pure guesswork.’ Government policy is based on an assumption that gas prices will continue to rise, but Dr Peiser said the price could fall. He said: ‘Prices are likely to come down very significantly, perhaps by 30 to 40 per cent if the UK Government gives the green light to shale gas exploration. The UK is sitting on a gold mine of shale gas.’ Energy industry expert Joe Malinowski, of TheEnergyShop.com, said he was ‘deeply sceptical’ about Mr Huhne’s claims of lower bills. The CBI is particularly fearful of the impact of green taxes. Chief policy director Katja Hall said: ‘Energy intensive industries underpin the UK’s manufacturing sector, making products as diverse as the steel and chemicals needed for wind turbines and low-rolling resistance tyres. ‘The Government is in serious danger of throwing out the baby with the bathwater if it continues to pile new costs on to industries.’ The Government plans to spend £11billion installing smart meters in every property, saying that once  people see how much energy they use, they will make cutbacks. Ministers say energy use will also be reduced by the so-called Green Deal, which will allow people to install double-glazing and loft insulation at no upfront cost. But a spokesman for consumer group Which? said: ‘If take-up is lower than expected, energy bills will be pushed up even further.’","Chris Huhne makes comments during Commons statement .

"A mother has spoken of her disgust after staff at a medical centre refused to treat her unconscious five year-old son because he wasn’t registered at the practice. Natalie Midgley, 27, desperately tried to revive her son Junior after he collapsed just a few yards from the centre. But when a family friend ran in for help she was told to phone 999 because the youngster wasn’t registered there and wasn’t known to them. Helpless: Natalie Midgley (centre) desperately tried to revive her son Junior after he collapsed just a few yards from a GPs' surgery. Family friend Storm Styles (right) was told by staff to call 999 instead . Ms Midgley was with her son when she dropped the friend off for a medical appointment at Petersgate Medical Centre, near Scawthorpe, Doncaster. Her son, who had been suffering from undiagnosed seizures for nearly six months, then suddenly collapsed. Emergency services were alerted and Junior recovered consciousness just as an ambulance arrived to take him to Doncaster Royal Infirmary. Ms Midgley said: 'It was the worst experience of my life. Junior had been at A&E just a few hours earlier in the morning because he’d been going pale and having seizures for the past few months. 'He is still undergoing tests to find . out what is causing the seizures. On the way to drop off my friend he . started going really grey and I knew what was going to happen. Natalie Midgley claims that staff at Petersgate Medical Centre (pictured), near Doncaster, refused to treat her five-year-old son because he wasn't registered at the practice . 'He kept lapsing in and out of . consciousness and he wasn’t responding to my voice. My friend ran into . the medical centre for help. I thought I was in the best place possible . because I needed help quickly. But . when they discovered he wasn’t registered with them they refused to . help us. I was absolutely disgusted, I couldn’t believe they would . refuse to help a five year-old child who was lying in my arms . unconscious. Last week a two-year-old bleeding heavily from a severe head wound was refused emergency first aid at an NHS urgent care centre – even though he suffered the injury in the waiting room. Apo Bakan tripped and banged his head on a chair, leaving a gash on his forehead that exposed his skull. His mother Linzi pleaded for help but a nurse and a GP told her to go to the nearest A&E unit instead because they didn’t deal with ‘things like this’. Mrs Bakan, 27, said: ‘Apo was covered in blood. When I saw his skull I was hysterical. I begged staff to help but they wouldn’t. There was no comfort, no care and no compassion.’ Mrs Bakan had taken Apo to the Doctor Piper House Urgent Care Centre in Darlington with her husband, also called Apo, in May 2012 to ask about a skin complaint. The boy’s wound was later stitched up at The University Hospital of North Durham. 'My worst fears were that he might die. It was very scary and no one even came out out to look at Junior or help us. 'The ambulance people tried to talk us through what to do while they were on their way. It took about 10 minutes for them to arrive and they were the longest 10 minutes of my life.' Ms Midgley's friend Storm Styles, 38, said: 'I told the receptionist that Junior and his mum were not registered with the practice but she said there was nothing they could do and suggested I phone 999. No one even came out to check his condition. It was disgusting.' Junior was checked at hospital and is due to have a follow up appointment in an effort to discover the problem. Doctors have suggested he could be suffering from a form of epilepsy. Ms Midgley, who has two other children Coben, nine, and three-year-old Jenson, is now making an official complaint to the medical centre which employs five doctors, four nurses, five reception and administration staff and a community midwife. A spokesman for Petersgate Medical Centre said; 'We are sorry to hear about this incident and hope that the child has made a full recovery. 'We are unable to comment further at this point of time, but will ensure that if a complaint is made it will be fully investigated.'","Natalie Midgley's son Junior, 5, collapsed outside Petersgate Medical Centre .

"The Oxford English Dictionary will change the defintion of marriage now a law allowing same-sex unions has been passed . The leading authority on the English language has confirmed that the definition of the word 'marriage' will be changed now a law allowing same-sex couples to get married has been passed. Language experts at the Oxford English Dictionary said the definition did not change overnight but they will monitor how the word marriage . changes over the next year. An Oxford University Press . spokeswoman said: ‘We continually monitor the words in our dictionaries, . paying particular to those words whose usage is shifting, so yes, this . will happen with marriage.’ As it stands, OxfordDictionaries.com defines marriage as being a ‘formal union of a man and a woman, typically as recognised by law, by which they become husband and wife.’ In a reference, it says marriage could also be ‘(in some jurisdictions) a union between partners of the same sex’. Gay marriage was passed by Parliament on . July 17 despite fierce opposition from some Tory MPs and grassroots . members, who were angered by the Prime Minister prioritising the issue . over economic problems. ‘We are constantly monitoring usage in this area in order to consider what revisions and updates we may need to make,’ the Oxford University Press spokeswoman told the Gay Star News. ‘It’s worth pointing out that, as the OED is distinct from other dictionaries in being a historical record of the language, meanings of the past will remain, even while language changes and new ones are added.’ Other countries that have changed the definition of marriage are France, where dictionary Larousse changed the definition to a ‘solemn act between two same-sex or different-sex persons, who decide to establish a union’, and Canada.

"A teenager was tortured to death by his sister and her boyfriend after they accused him of witchcraft, a court was told yesterday. Kristy Bamu, 15, drowned in the bath of a blood-soaked flat on Christmas Day 2010 after begging to die in a ‘tale of horror’. He suffered 101 separate injuries as he was attacked with weapons including metal poles, pliers, knives, a hammer and heavy ceramic tiles. His sister Magalie Bamu and her boyfriend Eric Bikubi, both 28, are accused of beating him to death because they believed he had been possessed by evil spirits. Victim: Kristy Bamu, left, had 101 injuries. His sister's boyfriend Eric Bikubi, right, is accused of beating him to death . In a ‘staggering act of depravity and cruelty’ they even forced his two brothers and two sisters, aged between 11 and 22, to join in the attacks, the Old Bailey was told. The two sisters were also badly wounded after being accused of sorcery, black magic and witchcraft. The siblings had been sent from home in Paris by their parents to enjoy a festive break with their sister at her flat in Forest Gate, East London. But the visit descended into an almost unimaginable nightmare of violence, the jury heard. Prosecutor Brian Altman QC said the defendants were responsible for ‘unspeakable savagery’ over four days in the locked eighth-floor flat. Those involved were originally from the Congo where ‘kindoki’ witchcraft pervades society, he said. It exists alongside the Christian church where religious leaders encourage fasting and purifying with water to exorcise spirits from children. Mr Altman said: ‘We say that was what was practised by these two. A court drawing from the Old Bailey of Eric Bikubi, 27, and Magalie Bamu, 28, who deny murdering Bamu's 15-year-old brother Kristy after accusing him of being a sorcerer . ‘If the practice of kindoki is . dislocated from the supervisory influence of religious leaders, it may . take on a feral and, indeed, evil character. ‘The defendants were seeking Kristy’s . deliverance and exorcism through the dealing out of ever-increasingly . violent punishments.’ Paramedics discovered a scene of . horror when Bamu dialled 999 and called them to her flat claiming Kristy . had drowned in the bath. Bikubi was trying to resuscitate the victim’s lifeless body as his soaking wet siblings screamed hysterically. Kristy was covered in injuries and . some of his teeth were missing. He had died from a combination of his . injuries and drowning. Blood-stained clothes and weapons, including . metal bars, blood-stained pliers, knives and a chisel lay everywhere. A French-speaking paramedic managed to coax details from the victim’s 22-year-old sister, Kelly. Mr Altman said: ‘She said Eric Bikubi . had beaten her with a metal bar. She went on to explain that over the . last four days Eric Bikubi had been abusing the 11-year-old sister, . Kristy and herself.’ Jurors at the Old Bailey heard the teenager was killed because he was suspected of witchcraft . The jury was told the trip for the two . sisters and two brothers began without incident. But the mood turned . sour when football coach Bikubi accused Kristy and his two sisters of . bewitching another child in the family. Despite their denials, he and . Bamu beat the four of them and refused to let them eat, drink or sleep . for days as Bikubi shouted ‘who’s controlling you’ at Kristy. The couple ordered them to pray and chant through the night before joining attacks on Kristy. At one point Kristy was made to kneel . on the floor as floor tiles were smashed over his head. His teeth were . smashed with a hammer and he was made to drink urine. His sister is accused of egging on her . boyfriend and joining the barbaric torture when he became tired, . including one attack in which she used pliers to tear her brother’s ear. When Kelly was caught only pretending . to beat her brother, Bikubi forced a lightbulb into her mouth, grabbed . her round the throat and held a knife to her chest. When she asked Bamu why she was doing nothing to protect them, she allegedly replied they ‘deserved it’. ‘The children had no option other than to do as they were told or risk the same violence,’ Mr Altman said. ‘As Kristy’s injuries became ever more severe, he pleaded to be allowed to die.’ Dozens of calls were made to the children’s father, Pierre, in Paris, in which the couple claimed the children were sorcerers. Kristy begged his father to pick him . up warning that he would be killed but Mr Bamu did not believe his son . as he regarded Bikubi as ‘pleasant and gentle’. In the first seven hours of Christmas . Day at least 45 calls were made to Paris and the parents eventually . arranged to travel on December 27. But it was too late. At around noon . that day Kristy was thrown in the bath. He drowned as he was too badly . injured to keep his head above water. His brothers and sisters were made . to get in too and were hosed down as neighbours beat on the door . because their homes were flooded. A calm Bikubi even turned away a . plumber sent by the council to investigate the leak just 20 minutes . before emergency services were called. Mr Altman said Kristy had tried to . escape but it was ‘futile’ as the flat was locked: ‘There was no escape . for him – or indeed for any of them.’ Bikubi, who is currently in Broadmoor, . denies murder but admits manslaughter and assault on the grounds he was . suffering from schizophrenia and was not responsible for his actions.

The incredible hoard of 32 rare photographs depict the Hollywood icon's career from start to finish and will go under the hammer on November 26. The collection includes an early shot of the actress in early 1946, aged just 15, wearing a white jumper and beret in her first ever glamour shoot. Scroll down for video . One of the last pictures ever taken of Marilyn at a photo shoot in 1962 is part of a collection going on sale . One haunting image shows the star, who died in 1962 from an overdose, feigning death . The photos could fetch an impressive £80,000 at auction when they go under hammer on November 26 . The 32 rare photographs up for auction depict the Hollywood icon's career from start to finish . The collection includes an original photo issued by Fox Studios showing her in sultry pose, wearing a sling back dress . Other candid snaps show the blonde beauty at different stages of her life right up until one of the last ever photos taken of her in July 1962. The black and white image was captured just weeks before she was found dead aged 36 at her LA home following a barbiturate overdose on August 5, 1962. Taken by celebrity snapper George Barris the poignant snap shows Marilyn in a cream jumper lying on a beach, resting her chin on her hands and staring into the camera. The set also includes a chilling picture Monroe had commissioned herself of her pretending to be dead - just a few months before she passed away. Others include an original photo issued by Fox Studios showing her in sultry pose, wearing a sling back dress. It was this image which inspired artist Andy Warhol as the basis for his now world famous screen print images of her. Some of the pictures of the iconic star will never have been seen by the general public before . Many of the pictures show Marilyn as the care-free sex symbol she was most well known as . Each individual image could fetch up to £2,500 each when they are auctioned . The pictures go back to the start of her career when she looked markedly different with brunette hair . Marilyn, really called Norma Jeane Mortenson, totally transformed her image over the course of her career . Despite her carefree public image, Marilyn's life was marked by unhappiness and heartbreak . The collection of original prints are being sold by professional snooker player Dominic Dale, who has collected Monroe memorabilia for the past 25 years. Each individual image could fetch up to £2,500 each when they are auctioned by Mullocks Auctioneers at Ludlow Racecourse, Shrops., in two weeks time.. Richard Westwood-Brookes, historical document expert at the auctioneers, said: 'These are classic images of Marilyn and are works of high art in their own right. The collection of original prints are being sold by professional snooker player Dominic Dale, who has collected Monroe memorabilia for the past 25 years . Marilyn's 'ditsy blonde' persona, which many of her roles revolved around, hid a woman of real intelligence . 'What's important about these photos is that they all have their photographer's stamp on the back, so they have come straight from the negative of the image . 'As a result we are pricing them at £500 estimate each. 'But judging from the worldwide interest in original photographs such as these of Marilyn we expect that they will make far more. 'We have seen similar images to these changing hands in recent times for five times that figure. Not many of the photos in the mammoth collection are in colour, which will surely raise their value . The star is considered by many, even over fifty years after her death, to be one of the most beautiful women ever . The collection also boasts an original signature of Marilyn surmounted by a rare black and white photograph taken by the celebrated American photographer Andre De Dienes on Tobey Beach in May 1949 . The set also includes snaps by several other renowned photographers including Joseph Jasgur, who signed this snap . 'This is a chance to own one of the largest private collections of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia in the world. 'It really is a really unique opportunity to get your hands on some rare photos of one of the most iconic Hollywood stars that ever lived.' The collection also boasts an original signature of Marilyn surmounted by a rare black and white photograph taken by the celebrated American photographer Andre De Dienes on Tobey Beach in May 1949. Marilyn was on a promotional tour for the film titled 'Love Happy', a Marx Brothers movie, when she met up with the Mr De Dienes who first photographed her in 1945 as the young Norma Jeane Dougherty, a 19-year-old model with the Blue Book Modelling Agency. The set also includes snaps by several other renowned photographers including Joseph Jasgur, Bruno Bernard, Philippe Halsman and Milton H Greene. The intense interest sparked by the collection becoming available shows our obsession with Marilyn is as strong as ever . Mr Westwood-Brookes added: 'In addition to the photographs, Dominic's collection also has some very important books including an extremely rare edition of 'Marilyn - a Hollywood Farewell' by Leigh Wiener with preface by Richard B Stolley. 'This was produced in 1990 as a limited edition signed by Wiener and Stolley. 'Unfortunately Wiener died before he could complete more than a few signings, and the copy we are offering is one of those very few which bear both signatures, together with an autograph dedication from Stolley to Dominic Dale. 'The collection also contains the definitive books produced by the photographers, which include printed versions of the originals we are offering in the sale, and many other rare and desirable books about Marilyn.' Snooker ace Dominic, 42, added: 'It will be sad to see them go but my snooker commitments now call for me to be jetting around the world all the time. 'I think the time has come for my collection to pass into the hands of other lovers of Marilyn who will cherish them as much as I have done.' Dominic, whose nickname is 'The Spaceman', is one of the top 30 professional snooker champions in the world. Despite being born in Coventry, he represents Wales and has won the Grand Prix of snooker as well as the prestigious Shanghai Masters. He regularly appears on television where, in addition to playing, he also appears as a commentator and presenter.","Hoard of 32 rare photographs depict Marilyn's career from start to finish .

"As any parent will tell you, teenagers and their phones are not easily parted. Take 16-year-old Ella Sankey, who dropped her new iPhone down a drain while walking her dog. Determined . to retrieve it, she climbed into the drain – only to find that she . couldn’t get out. An amused crowd, including her own mother, gathered to . watch her struggle before she was eventually freed by firemen. The teenager became caught in the storm drain in an attempt to retrieve her phone - the part of the storm drain she picked up apparently weighed 22 kg . Firefighters rescued the girl from the drain near her home less than 10 minutes after receiving the call . After unsuccessful attempts from friends and family, as well as many, many cameraphone pictures, firefighters were eventually called to hoist her out . Ella-Anne shortly after regaining her freedom. The teenager is completely unhurt but the phone is ruined . Emergency services had to be called and, luckily, it was a quick rescue. Kent Fire and Rescue Service received the call at 7.17pm and by 7.26pm, Miss Birchenough was free. These photographs, taken by an eye witness, show two firefighters grabbing her arms and hauling her to safety while another watches on. The girl's mother, Joanne Birchenough , 36, dashed to the scene and then dialled 999 and three firefighters turned up to gently pull the red-faced schoolgirl free. Miss Birchenough, a GCSE student at Astol College, had only had bought the phone two weeks ago on a contract. She said: 'I was talking to somebody and I went to put my phone in my pocket and it fell down the drain. 'I thought to myself 'I'm not leaving this' and I jumped down to get it. 'I wasn't really even stuck, I just need somebody to help lift me out but my mum got all panicky. 'When they pulled me out I ran straight home and jumped in the bath. I think it was just water but I wasn't taking any chances. Ella-Anne Birchenough, 16, managed to squeeze down the small drain on her street in Dover, Kent . 'I was just laughing the whole time, I have seen the funny side of it. You just have to laugh along with it. 'There have been a few nasty comments about me being fat which isn't nice but I'm trying not to take it to heart.' Taxi operative Joanne, who also has an . eight-year-old son Ben, said: 'I was really worried. My face went white . and I was in a panic. Ella-Anne had to hoist off the heavy drain cover to climb down, she said even at the time she saw the funny side . 'I was scared she might sink. 'I ran out the house, turned the corner - but as soon as I saw her I burst out laughing. 'I thought 'we are never going to get her out of there' so I called the fire service who got there pretty quickly. 'We are going to have to replace the phone but I'm not too angry. Worst case scenario is she ends up with an old Nokia. 'She is never going to live this down now. We will be bringing it out at her 18th birthday and her wedding. 'But worse things can happen then getting stuck in a drain.' A . firefighter from Dover fire station said: 'She was trying to retrieve . her iPhone that she dropped down there. It's very unusual! I hear a few . people have taken pictures.' The drain cover and a pair of red wellies and a towel, understood to belong to the teenager, were next to the drain. The photos of the incident have been posted on Facebook and Twitter and have since gone viral on the social networking sites. The girl was not injured but a friend posted on Facebook that the phone was 'ruined'. The . unlucky teen is not the first person to become stuck somewhere most . people wouldn't dare tread. Pushing the bounds of ingenuity, people are . getting themselves jammed in ever more elaborate places. 1) Who can forget Boris Johnson on the zip wire? At an event in London's Victoria Park back in August 2012, the Mayor of London was whizzing along the contraption in a bid to promote the Olympics. However, his best laid plans went awry when he became stranded halfway along the 1,000ft wire. Embracing the homour of the situation, Boris meekly waved two Union Jacks while waiting for a ladder to inelegantly help him back to the ground. Commenting on the incident at the time, David Cameron said: 'If any other politician anywhere in the world was stuck on a zip-wire it would be a disaster. For Boris, it’s an absolute triumph.' 2) Seaside arcade machines are notoriously difficult to win a prize from. However, while most children simply accept their frustration, three-year-old Christopher Air decided to take matters into his own hands while on a family holiday to Skegness in 2008. Christopher was having no luck snagging a teddy with the machine's mechanical arm but, in the spirit of holiday, his mother went to change a £20 note so her son could try again. But, while her back was turned, Christopher managed to wriggle his way into the machine through the prize flap and get his hands on the bear. His joy was short-lived, however, as he quickly realised that getting out wouldn't be so easy. To make matters worse, the arcade owner couldn't find his keys and it was half an hour before he managed to free to boy. At least Christopher was able to hold onto the bear. 3) One prankster in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, saw his joke get out of hand in June 2013, when he managed to squeeze himself inside a traffic bollard in a bid to make his friends laugh. Unable to squirm out in the same way, he wandered along the high street for two hours before police turned up and managed to yank him free. Unable to hide his relief, the man said 'thank you so much' to the officers who finally rescued him. Speaking at the time, an eyewitness said: 'It was very random, it’s not the usual thing you see in the middle of Hemel Hempstead on a Sunday lunchtime. I came out of Burger King and this man had the bollard stuck on his head. 'I had seen him walking with it on top of his head five minutes earlier, but now it was pulled right down. 'No-one was helping him because they thought he was just messing around.' 4) Many a person has found themselves caught up while trying to untangle a washing line but it's a more select group who can do the same with a clothes horse. Student Danielle Morgan, 18, became so caught up in hers, however, she was forced to call out the fire brigade to rescue her. The student at the University of Derby admitted she was playing around just before the incident occurred in November 2011. She accidentally knocked over the clothes horse and it collapsed onto her, trapping her head and shoulders between its joints. Posting on Facebook after the drama was all over, Miss Morgan wrote: 'Having four hunky firemen and two paramedics come to my rescue! What a way to spend a Sunday night. I feel like I’ve been stuck in a clothes horse for an hour!'","Ella-Anne Birchenough, from Dover, Kent, dropped her iPhone in the drain .

"Around 650,000 people in Britain have essential tremor, an uncontrollable shake that makes everyday tasks difficult. But a form of radiation therapy can resolve the problem. Retired civil servant Roy Le Croissette, 74, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, underwent the procedure, as he tells DIANA PILKINGTON. THE PATIENT . Tremor runs in my family. My grandfather and my mother had it, and I first noticed mine aged nine. I loved wood (my other grandfather was from a line of cabinet makers), but I couldn’t use a chisel without my right hand shaking. As I got older it got worse. Teachers said my essays were spoilt by my appalling handwriting. And I even considered giving away my treasured stamp collection because I couldn’t pick them up with tweezers. Brain scan: A coloured Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan through a human head, showing a healthy brain in side view. Gamma Knife is a radiation device. It's called radiosurgery, because of it's focus on very high intensity radiation on a tiny area, aiming to destroy it. It's specifically designed for the head . Everyday tasks were problematic. When carrying tea I’d do the ‘teacup tango’ — it would bounce in its saucer and spill out — and doing up buttons took all my patience. And when out for a meal, if I wanted soup I sometimes had to get on my knees to drink it. My wife was wonderfully supportive and I managed to work, but it was frustrating. I couldn’t take the minutes of a meeting because my writing was illegible. I spoke to my GP at intervals but was always told I’d get used to it. Finally I decided enough was enough, and I was referred to Professor Marwan Hariz at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London in 2010. I was told I could have been a good candidate for deep brain stimulation, where they use electrodes to stimulate the area of your brain responsible for tremor, but because I’d had a stroke in 2008 and was on the blood-thinner warfarin, there was a risk I could bleed to death, as it involves putting a metal probe in the brain. There was another option: Gamma Knife, which delivers radiation to the brain, would effectively burn out the bit of it that controlled the shakes. I was warned that there might be side-effects — such as speech difficulty, or limbs not functioning as well as before — but I thought it worth the risk. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get the treatment on the NHS, so my colleagues in the Freemasons helped me get funding through their charity to have it at the Bupa Cromwell Hospital. I was over the moon. A patient undergoing Gamma Knife. The treatment can get rid of essential tremor completely, but patients could possibly develop more tremor at a later stage . The procedure was scheduled for September 2012, under neurosurgeon Christer Lindquist. They began by measuring me up for a frame, which would be screwed into my skull to keep my head in place. It was a bit like wearing a TV screen on my head. After having two scans of my brain, I lay on a table with the frame on my head, and was slid into the Gamma Knife machine. I’d brought some music to listen to, and shut my eyes. There was no pain, just a loud clanging. It took about two hours and I think I even fell asleep. When I came out, the professor took the frame off and asked me to touch my fingers together. He nearly fell over at how easily I did it. But it was six months before I noticed the major differences. Now I can write beautifully and do carpentry, whereas before I’d have lost a finger. I slur a bit now, but if that’s the only side-effect, I couldn’t care less. THE SURGEON . Professor Christer Lindquist is a consultant neurosurgeon at the Bupa Cromwell Hospital, London. He says: . ESSENTIAL tremor runs in families but the exact cause is unknown. It’s degenerative, so it comes with age. In people with tremor, the nerve cells in an area of the thalamus, the part of the brain that controls movement, are firing in an abnormal pattern. Professor Christer Lindquist, pictured here, is a consultant neurosurgeon at the Bupa Cromwell Hospital, London. 'As far as I am aware, I'm the only surgeon in the country to use Gamma Knife to treat tremor,' he said . Beta-blockers can be effective, perhaps because they block brain chemicals involved in tremor. Alcohol can also have a pronounced effect. My father-in-law had the condition and was very steady with a glass of whisky in his hand. Surgery is only necessary when it becomes a real social problem or affects daily life. There . are three main surgical options. One is to put an electrode in the . brain and use radiofrequency to heat the tissue and destroy the ventral . intermediate nucleus (VIM), the pea-sized area in the thalamus . responsible for the shakes. You can also use deep brain stimulation, where electrodes stimulate the nerve cells in the VIM to block their activity. But . both methods are invasive, risking bleeding and infection, and with . deep brain stimulation patients must carry a battery around for the rest . of their life. Moreover, they are not suitable for patients on . blood-thinning drugs. As far as I’m aware, I’m the only surgeon in the country to use Gamma Knife to treat tremor. I started using it in 1985. Gamma . Knife is a radiation device. We call the treatment radiosurgery, . because we’re focusing very high intensity radiation on a tiny area, . aiming to destroy it. It’s specifically designed for the head: most . commonly for brain tumours, but also for facial pain and for cutting off . the blood supply to vascular malformations. We give the patient a light sedative, then inject local anaesthetic into four points on their head so we can fix an aluminium frame into it (there may be light bleeding when it is removed later). We then place a Perspex cube over the top of the frame and carry out an MRI scan. This cube has coordinates on it, so a computer can work out exactly where our target is. We then fix the head frame to the couch that goes inside the Gamma Knife, so the thalamus is right at the device’s centre. Once we turn it on, 192 beams of radiation converge on the target. Each beam is quite weak, sparing healthy tissue. The radiation only becomes toxic where all the beams meet. There is a risk of slight swelling from the radiation causing weakness in the area of the body where the tremor was. It could also cause speech difficulties, because the nerve cells affecting muscles involved in speech are close to the VIM. The treatment can get rid of the tremor completely, but patients could possibly develop more tremor at a later stage. We’ve treated about ten tremor patients here with Gamma Knife since 1998. In Britain it’s mainly used on patients who are not suitable for deep brain stimulation, but in other countries it is a primary procedure. A recent large study in Japan showed the two procedures had similar outcomes. Gamma Knife radiosurgery is only available on the NHS in exceptional circumstances. But the committee that advises the NHS has proposed that it should be available. The procedure costs around £15,000 privately, and could cost the NHS around £8,000.","Around 65,000 people in UK have an essential tremor: uncontrollable shakes .

"It's that time of year when flies and wasps lurk around every corner, threatening to ruin your summer picnics and barbeques, not to mention leave you with a nasty sting. Swatting with a rolled up newspaper is rarely effective, but fear not: A revolutionary device that takes out an annoying bug with a single shot is now available. The Bug-A-Salt is an air-powered rifle that blasts a pinch of table salt at such high velocity that it is lethal to creepy-crawlies. Scroll down for video . Watch out wasps! Makers claim Bug-A-Salt (pictured being refilled) has transformed 'bug-hunting' into a sport . Unlike fly swatters, which often leave smears of dead fly after they have been squashed, the only clean-up this device needs is a quick brush. 1. Lift the loader cap and pour in ordinary granulated table salt (holds about 50 shots). 2. Slide the cocking handle towards you and push away towards the barrel of gun. This action will activate the auto-safety and the pop-up sight will appear, indicating gun is ready to fire. 3. Release the auto-safety by clicking towards you. 4. Aim at target and fire. The pump-action fly-killer has already been bought by almost 100,000 people in the US for $39.95, and the device is now available online in the UK, priced approximately £35. The plastic shotgun requires no battery power or charging and instead uses compressed air to propel a pinch of table salt at the intended target, and holds enough salt for 50 shots before reloading. The device is made by Skell Inc, a start-up company founded by Santa Monica, California artist Lorenzo Maggiore. They say using ordinary table salt as opposed to dangerous chemicals and pesticides is a better way to dispose of critters. The company is also apparently developing similar products in the near future. Fly swatting just got serious: The shotgun uses compressed air to propel table salt at the intended target . The gun's ability to kill varies on its distance from 'prey' (diagram of its accuracy pictured, left). The Bug-A-Salt (pictured, right) should be used from a distance of three feet (90cm) and fires 50 shots before it needs refilling . A spokesperson for the company said: 'This is a completely safe way to take out an annoying bug. 'Because it uses ordinary granulated table salt, it would never break the skin on even the smallest child - although we do not recommend firing it at people.' 'If you’ve got half-decent aim, you can take out a fly from more than three feet away. It’s an extremely effective method of killing pesky mosquitoes and moths as well.'","The Bug-A-Salt is an air-powered rifle .

"Last week, Mail Online reported on the case of Lucie Slater - a 21 year-old woman who glassed her defenceless boyfriend in the face. Ms Slater, a bar promoter from Gateshead - who was a contestant on ITV talent show The X Factor before being disqualified for her actions - launched the vicious attack on her boyfriend William Aitken after seeing a Facebook message she simply 'disliked'. The assault, which took place in the victim's Northumberland home, last summer, was so violent that it pierced an artery, scarring him for life – potentially destroying his burgeoning modelling career. Anger: The attack took place after Slater came across a message on Facebook that she did not like.  The couple are pictured here during happier times . It also caused severe blood loss and permanent nerve damage to his face. Devastated Mr Aitken has described the incident as ‘tragic’ and ‘life-changing from that moment on.’ At the hospital where he received treatment, Slater claimed Aitken sustained his injuries from falling down the stairs, before changing her story and claiming it was an accident involving flying shards of glass. Perhaps, given the opportunity, she also might've claimed he walked into a door. Tragic: William Aitkin after being attacked by Lucie Slater . After all, for all its subterfuge about television programmes, social networking sites and alcohol, this is nothing less than spousal abuse. A classic case of domestic violence made infinitely worse by the delusion that because it's a female avenging a (perceived) broken heart caused by a man it's OK. It's not. Dangerously, this misnomer seems to be backed by both society and the law. Last week, just like his girlfriend had done months earlier, the British legal system delivered Aitken a cruel, underserving blow - this time, by letting his attacker escape jail. Despite pleading guilty to unlawful wounding, thus qualifying for a five-year custodial sentence, Slater walked away with nothing more than a suspended sentence, a two-year supervision order and 120 hours of community service. Musical: Slater is pictured left during an X Factor rehearsal with Quantro . In a public message to all violent women, it implied that attacking men is girl power, not a criminal offence worthy of prison time - even when that means thrusting a wine glass into somebody's face and throwing a laptop across a room. In a disturbing example of modern justice, Slater will now enjoy all the trappings of Christmas without a shred of real, tangible punishment in sight. No wonder, along with the case of Paul Stratford - who walked free from court after punching a headmistress for reprimanding his unruly son - it sparked the Mail's What Does It Take To Get Jailed? report, last week. Quite frankly, both rulings are a joke. But, despite being equal understatements of justice, they differ on one crucial element - bias. While Stratford was likely given leniency for having a dependent child, in my opinion, Slater got off (from a much bloodier crime) simply because she's a woman. Booted out: Slater, a bar promotion worker, was part of girl band Quantro but the group was thrown off the ITV talent show when the attack came to light . And it's increasingly common. Last month, Bianca Hendry from Middlesborough escaped jail - despite having a previous conviction for battery - after biting the tip off another club-goer’s finger in a dance floor confrontation over 'stares'. Similarly, on Friday, Victoria Willis from Darlington walked free from court after stabbing her boyfriend with a kitchen knife at their home. Her punishment? She was given a community order. Earlier this year, Sheona Keith glassed a male clubber for simply smiling at her - but was spared jail by a judge. Instead, she was given a conditional discharge and ordered to pay £400 compensation by Judge Philip Wassall at Exeter Crown Court. Had these been cases of men attacking women, then - quite rightly - they would've been given much stiffer penalties. But, in the same week where car insurance brokers are no longer able to discriminate against male drivers, the courts should be applying their policies equally, too. Phillip Davies MP has spoken out against pro-female discrimination endemic throughout UK courts . Thankfully, I'm not alone in my theory of equal equality - some people in power agree, too. Last October, during a House of Commons debate on the topic of sentencing female offenders, Phillip Davies MP delivered an outstanding critique of the pro-female discrimination endemic throughout UK courts. A transcript of the debate, which can be found online, is 14 pages long and (as far as I'm aware) the only example of its kind in British politics. As we approach 2013, we truly need more people like him - male and female - to speak up and defend fair justice if society is ever going to be equal for both men and women, boys and girls, victims and the vulnerable. Part of this involves both victims and attackers realising that women are just as guilty as men. Last week, newspapers reported on the case of Julie Griffiths - a 43-year-old from Newcastle-Under-Lyme who breached her ASBO 47 times in three months by verbally abusing her husband. The tirades were so loud and mentally torturous that they kept their neighbours awake at night. Inappropriately, headlines described her as a 'nagging wife', when - in reality - she is an abusive one. Like Lucie Slater, I doubt very much she even recognises this herself (after all, no females commit domestic violence - right?), but only stiffer legal sentences will change the world's view on violent women. And their view of themselves. Given that Slater's victim still claims to 'love' his attacker (evidence that men suffer the misleadingly-titled 'battered wife' syndrome too), this needs to happen fast. Certain newspapers and courts may treat female-on-male violence as a joke, but this is one issue which definitely has no room for a punchline.","Slater attacked her DJ boyfriend William Aitken after seeing a message on Facebook .

"Polish women living in the UK gave birth to 23,000 children last year . Immigrant mothers: More than a quarter of births in Britain last year were to mothers born outside the UK . A record number of nearly 200,000 babies were born to immigrant mothers last year, figures revealed yesterday. The children of women who were themselves born abroad made up nearly a quarter of all the babies born in Britain. The report by the Office for National Statistics pointed to the growing impact on the population of the historically high levels of immigration in recent years. It said understanding the impact of childbearing among migrants is ‘essential for planning services such as maternity provision and schools’. The figures showed that 24 per cent of births in 2011 were to women who had not themselves been born in Britain, which is the best indicator statisticians have for who is an immigrant. In London, where a high proportion of migrants choose to live, the share of births to foreign-born mothers was well over half, 57 per cent. The five countries from which the greatest numbers of foreign-born mothers came were Poland, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Nigeria. The share of new babies born to migrant mothers has more than doubled in 20 years and continues to shoot up. Figures: Graph showing live births in Britain between 2007 and 2011 to women from the top five countries (Office for National Statistics) According to the ONS analysis, the . number of babies born to British-born mothers barely changed in the five . years from 2007 to 2011, up from 603,000 to 612,000. However migrant . mother births went up from 169,000 to 196,000, an increase of 16 per . cent. The report said there had been a 24 . per cent rise in the number of women of childbearing age who were born . outside the UK and a fall of 5 per cent in the number of UK women of . childbearing age since 2007. It added that mothers from Poland, who . gave birth to 23,000 children in Britain last year, are now at the top . of the league table of foreign-born mothers in Britain even though birth . rates in Poland itself are low. On the rise: A graph showing the percentage of live births in the UK to non-UK born mothers between 2001 to 2011 . Marked difference: Pyramid of the female population living in the UK. It shows the number of births for UK born women and non-UK born women, between 2007 and 2011 . ‘This can be explained by the younger . age structure of the population born in Poland and by timing effects, . given that the majority of those born in Poland will be people of young . working age who have migrated to the UK since EU accession in 2004.’ Nearly 6,000 babies were born to . mothers who were themselves born in Germany, enough to put Germany . seventh on the list of countries from which migrant mothers come. However the report pointed out that . ‘many of those born in Germany will be British nationals whose parents . were serving in the armed forces in Germany at the time of their birth’. General fertility rates for the top five non-UK maternal countries of birth and for UK born women in 2011. Pakistan is markedly highest, followed by Nigeria . Baby boom: More than four out of ten births to foreign mothers last year were in London (file picture) The ONS added: ‘The increase in the . proportion of births to non-UK born mothers living in the UK illustrates . how the demographic make-up of the UK is changing.’ The report said . there were marked regional differences in the fertility rates of women, . both of those born abroad and those born in Britain. Overall, foreign-born women were . likely to have 2.28 children during their lives, while British born . women could expect, at 2011 fertility rates, to bear 1.89 children. But there was a bigger gap in London, . where fertility rates were higher for foreign-born women and where . fertility rates for British-born women were ‘well below average’. This may be because a higher . proportion of British-born women in London than elsewhere are pursuing . education and careers and delaying childbirth and families. Priscilla Gavioli and family . Brazilian-born Priscilla Gavioli, 34, gave birth to her son Daniel in July at the Whittington Hospital in North London. Miss Gavioli, who works in banking, arrived in London in 1996 as an 18-year-old looking for a better future. Six years later she met her partner, 39-year-old Steven Gray, and the couple now live in Muswell Hill. Miss Gavioli said when she first arrived there were more opportunities for her in London than in Brazil. But she added: ‘The opportunities seem to have reversed. Brazil is booming now. If there was something for us to do there we might consider going back. All my family still live there.’ The couple are acutely aware of the pressure childcare costs will have on their finances. Mr Gray, who works in the media, said: ‘A nursery will cost us £1,200 per month. I’d like a second child, but it’s so expensive.’","There were 200,000 births to immigrant mothers in Britain last year .

"Distress: Kathe Fothringham suffered a skiing accident with long-term implications for her neurological abilities . To the outsider, Kate Fothringham may appear to have an enviable life. The bright 44-year-old has two young sons and a loving husband, not to mention a PhD and a high-flying career as a headhunter on her CV. But, despite appearances, she is battling a hidden injury that turned her life upside down and forced her to adjust to what is, in her own words, 'a new normal'. In April 2010, on a family ski trip in the Alps, Kate was knocked over on a nursery slope, suffering a blow to the head that left her briefly unconscious. 'Two men skied straight into me and my instructor. I was thrown backwards downhill onto the back of my head with the combined weight of three men on top of me,' recalls Kate, who was wearing a helmet at the time. 'I was apparently unconscious for about a minute. I don't remember a thing, but got up unaided and was walking and talking, although obviously confused.' Taken to a nearby medical centre with suspected concussion, Kate had her hazy memory prodded by a doctor. 'I remember a voice needling in my head, asking questions - it was distressing as I didn't know the answers. I knew my own name and my family, but little else. 'But over the next two hours he was satisfied there was improvement in my recall so I was discharged, without referral for a CT scan or any advice - save to take paracetamol.' She says the pills were 'like putting a plaster on a car crash victim' and that night, suffered with 'thunderous pain'. 'I felt like I'd been run over by a truck. It hurt everywhere, especially my head, and I couldn't talk properly because it was painful using my tongue. I had no short-term memory so kept asking my exhausted husband Thomas the same questions.' Amazingly, Kate decided to soldier on, and two days later returned to the slopes, vowing not to let her accident spoil her holiday. Her memory had slightly improved, although she still felt weak, dizzy, nauseous and in pain. Back home in Perth, Scotland, she saw an osteopath for the whiplash and damage to her pelvis she had suffered. 'I thought I'd improve then. But when the physical pain fades, you notice neurological symptoms that are not fading at the same time.' Among these was impaired cognitive function. Kate found herself groping for words, lacking concentration and struggling to make decisions or plans. 'At this point I was a full-time mother, but couldn't have gone back to work anyway. 'In my job I'd analyse large amounts of information. Now I couldn't finish a newspaper article and reached information overload quickly. Even reading my son's (then five, now seven) school report was too much - I'd panic because I couldn't understand it. Cause for concern: One million Britons a year go to hospital after bangs on the head . 'I'd be in tears trying to work a new mobile phone. Having been a touch typist for decades, now I could only do one key at a time.' Kate felt constantly exhausted, suffered from a chronic headache and developed a stutter when stressed. She couldn't watch television because light and noise were painful, and regularly felt anxious and tearful. 'My family were supportive, but I was overwhelmed by the tiniest things - it was like I was holding on to life by my fingertips.' Despite feeling something was profoundly wrong, it was months before Kate received a satisfactory label for her problems. Visiting a GP shortly after the accident proved fruitless - he dismissed the idea of her having a scan because she was walking and talking. Five weeks later, suffering from blinding head pain, she saw another GP who referred her for a CT scan. 'I was on tenterhooks waiting for the results - I wanted proof there was a reason why I felt this way. But nothing showed up and I was told I was fine.' Seven months after the accident, having experienced only a gradual improvement in her symptoms, Kate contacted brain injury charity Headway and, on their advice, sought a referral to a neurologist. 'I couldn't wait longer so I got a private referral. He did tests to decipher my cognitive levels. I scored highly, but there were clear gaps in my mental functioning. 'In my job I'd analyse large amounts of . information. Now I couldn't finish a newspaper article and reached . information overload quickly. Even reading my son's (then five, now . seven) school report was too much.' 'I had classic damage to my brain's frontal lobe, which controls things like decision-making, planning and anything that makes it possible to carry on a normal life. It was a relief - at last someone believed me.' One million Britons a year go to hospital after bangs on the head - from minor to life-threatening. Kate appeared to be suffering from residual effects of mild traumatic brain injury. Such problems are sometimes called post-concussion syndrome - while symptoms typically resolve within weeks, they can last much longer and sometimes be permanent. Sometimes people may live with problems for years without connecting them with an old injury. These injuries can occur during sport, and due to more everyday knocks - from banging your head against a wall to slipping off a bike. Those most at risk include young children, young men and the elderly. Up to 80 per cent of head injuries are thought to fall into the minor category. 'For some there may be no long-lasting effects, but major consequences can follow seemingly trivial injuries,' says Colin Shieff, consultant neurosurgeon and Headway trustee. 'Anyone who's banged their head probably didn't feel perfect for a few minutes. It's not remarkable to have some headache the next day or a few days afterwards. But if functioning is abnormal - any problems of speech, communication, vision, cognition, or just finding everything more difficult - the patient may not be able to recognise it. 'If you feel at all unwell after banging your head, seek help or supervision. And if those symptoms persist for more than a few minutes, go to a hospital or doctor to be checked.' Although Kate was not told at the time, returning to the ski slopes after her injury was risky. Patients are usually advised not to play contact sports for three weeks after a minor head injury. Post-concussion syndrome: Residual effects of mild traumatic brain injury can sometimes last for weeks . 'You may be more likely to have a second injury - perhaps because you're a bit clumsier or have lost insight,' Mr Shieff says. 'And if there's some structural damage in the brain, a second bang on the head may increase the problem.' Kate's frustration over a lack of diagnosis is not uncommon, and Headway wants GPs to recognise the sometimes-subtle warning signs. Mr Shieff says: 'If someone has fallen and is bleeding from the ear, the doctor will know they need to go to hospital. 'But if they're having headaches and trouble concentrating, the doctor may not associate that with a bang to their head last week that they've neglected to mention.' And, as Kate found, a brain scan may not identify the 'invisible' injury she suffered. 'A CT scan looks for big clots of blood and bits of bone driven in rather than showing that the brain may not be working sensibly,' says Mr Shieff. 'These patients need to be assessed by someone with relevant skills.' Such people may have microscopic disturbances that have affected the electrical activity in parts of the brain - sometimes described to the patient as tiny abrasions. Dr Richard Warburg, a clinical neuropsychologist who worked for 30 years in brain injury rehabilitation for the NHS, says the 'mild' head injury label can be troublesome because people may have quite severe difficulties afterwards. 'This can be problematic psychologically, because common-sense thinking is you should recover quickly from mild injuries. There can be a vicious cycle of worrying about the symptoms, being unable to get an explanation, and consequently getting more worried.' For Kate, support from a neurologist and clinical psychologist has helped get her life back on track. A further diagnosis of post-traumatic stress allowed her to untangle her psychological symptoms from neurological ones. Three-and-a-half years on, she's learned to cope with how her brain now functions. 'If I forget a word, I take a deep breath and think of another, and I make lists of everything. I'm incredibly lucky - I've basically recovered. But it had a major effect on my life and I wish I'd had the support I needed sooner.'

Sheer scale: This computer-generated image puts into context the huge size of the largest warship ever built for the Royal Navy . Another notable poster is of the under-construction HMS Queen Elizabeth berthed alongside in Portsmouth, Hants. The ACA is a consortium of defence companies behind the construction of Portsmouth's newest carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales. Ian Booth, programme director of the ACA, said: 'These posters depict the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers in front of the Houses of Parliament and in Portsmouth. 'They're stunning images and show that two really spectacular ships can be expected once construction is complete.' A computer-generated image released last year showed how HMS Queen Elizabeth would look alongside at Portsmouth Naval Base. The images reveal the length of the ship is the equivalent of 28 London buses and is almost three times the size of Buckingham Palace.

"A British businessman is to be thrown out of China over a multimillion-pound bribery scandal, exposed after he was secretly filmed having sex with his lover. Mark Reilly, 52, ran British drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline’s Chinese operation, enjoying a lifestyle that included a £1.2million house back in the Home Counties. But he was handed a three-year suspended prison sentence – and the company landed with a £297million fine – after he admitted bribery charges. The Chinese court fined GSK 3 billion yuan (£300 million) for bribing doctors and hospitals to use its products, drawing to a close the high-profile corruption probe . The covertly filmed footage of the married executive was emailed anonymously last year to board members of the firm. Suspecting a disgruntled former employee of a blackmail attempt, he hired a private detective to investigate. But Chinese authorities turned the tables and accused him of running a huge bribery network. GSK was alleged to have bribed Chinese doctors and other health officials with £320million worth of gifts, including sexual favours from prostitutes, to persuade them to prescribe its drugs. Yesterday it was revealed the firm had been fined £297million while Reilly was given a suspended jail term and a deportation order. The scandal was unearthed when Reilly – who had worked at GSK for 25 years – was revealed to have been cheating on his 49-year-old wife Jill, with whom he has two daughters. The GlaxoSmithKline headquarters in London - the company has been landed with a £297 million fine – after a Briton admitted bribery charges . An anonymous email sent to board members in January last year contained the damning sex tape which had been secretly filmed at his flat in Shanghai. He was given permission to hire a British private investigator, Peter Humphrey, who launched a £20,000 probe focusing on disgruntled ex-employee Vivian Shi, 49, whose family is part of the city’s communist elite. A few months later, Mr Humphrey was arrested with wife Yu Yingzeng, a US citizen and daughter of one of China’s eminent atomic weapons scientists. At about the same time, Chinese authorities began investigating the alleged bribery network. Reilly was charged earlier this year with pressing his sales teams to bribe health officials, in a bid to meet targets. Chinese news agencies revealed yesterday that a court in Hunan province had sentenced Reilly after he pleaded guilty to charges relating to bribery of doctors and hospitals. GSK chief Sir Andrew Witty said the matter was ‘deeply disappointing’, adding: ‘We have and will continue to learn from this.’ The firm said it ‘fully accepts’ the facts of the investigation and the verdict and ‘sincerely apologises’ to patients and doctors.","Former executive Mark Reilly handed a three-year suspended sentence .

"Two Twitter trolls were jailed yesterday for threatening to kill and rape a feminist for campaigning to put Jane Austen on the new £10 note. Arts college graduate Isabella Sorley, 23, and unemployed recluse John Nimmo, 25, were told it was ‘hard to imagine more extreme threats’. As he jailed the pair at Westminster Magistrates' Court, Judge Howard Riddle said it was 'hard to imagine more extreme threats'. Sorley was given 12 weeks behind bars while co-defendant Nimmo was given eight weeks in prison. Jailed: Isabella Sorley, 23, (left) was jailed for 12 weeks and John Nimmo, 25, (right) was jailed for eight weeks for subjecting high-profile feminist Caroline Criado-Perez to abuse on Twitter . The pair bombarded feminist journalist Ms Criado-Perez with abusive messages last year after she led a successful campaign using . social media for a female figure to appear on a Bank of England note. Judge . Riddle said that, despite the defendants' claims, the harm threatened . against Ms Criado-Perez 'must have been intended to be very high'. Unemployed . Nimmo also targeted his abuse at Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for . Walthamstow, with the message 'The things I cud do to u (smiley face)', . calling her 'Dumb blond b****'. The judge said the effect of the abuse on Ms Criado-Perez had been 'life- changing'. She describes 'panic and fear and horror,' he said. He added that it had also had a 'substantial' impact on Ms Creasy, who has had a panic button installed in her home. Judge Riddle said that both victims of abuse had been terrified. Abuse: Caroline Criado-Perez who was targeted by trolls on Twitter after she campaigned for women's faces to be used on banknotes . 'The fact that they were anonymous heightened the fear,' he said. 'The . victims had no way of knowing how dangerous the people making the . threats were, whether they had just come out of prison, or how to . recognise and avoid them if they came across them in public.' Victim: Labour MP Stella Creasy who was also targeted by Twitter trolls . The court heard that university-educated Sorley has 25 previous convictions, the majority for being drunk and disorderly. While . on bail for this case, she also committed two offences of assaulting a . police officer and is awaiting sentence for an assault on New Year's . Day, the court heard. Judge Riddle said Nimmo 'used a degree of sophistication including using different accounts' to carry out the abuse and added: 'You appear to blame the victim to some degree.' He described Sorley as an 'intelligent and well-educated woman' with a 2:1 degree in creative advertising, but said her apology appeared 'hollow'. 'You have offended so many times when drunk that it must have been obvious to you that you needed to deal with this problem if you were not to continue to cause harm to others,' he said. During mitigation, Sean Caulfield, defending Sorley, said she herself was a 'victim' of new technology as she did not understand the impact of what she was doing. 'She understands what it must have been like now. At the time, it seems, she did not,' Mr Caulfield said. 'Maybe there's an issue about the technology and Twitter and people understanding what it must be like on the other end. 'She is a victim of that, if nothing else - a victim of a lack of understanding of what this new technology can do and how powerful it is.' Paul Kennedy, representing Nimmo, described him as a 'somewhat sad individual' who is 'effectively a social recluse'. The banknote announcement was hailed as a 'brilliant day for women' by Ms Criado-Perez who led the high profile campaign . Mr Kennedy said that, when Nimmo's . original tweet was responded to and retweeted, it encouraged him to send . more messages as he saw it as an 'indication of popularity'. 'He said that if that had not happened then he would not have pursued this course of action,' the barrister said. 'He believed at that time that there was a conversation and he was engaging in that conversation.' Mr . Kennedy said Nimmo had no particular opinion on the campaign but had . seen the topic trending on Twitter and his lack of experience of social . interaction meant he did not know his behaviour was inappropriate. Nimmo, . from South Shields, Tyne and Wear, and Sorley, from Akenside Hill, . Newcastle-upon-Tyne, pleaded guilty to sending menacing tweets on . January 7, admitting they were among the users of 86 separate Twitter . accounts from which Ms Criado-Perez had received abusive messages. The judge said both defendants would serve half their sentences in custody and ordered them each to pay £800 compensation. In . a statement released via Twitter after the sentencing, Ms Criado-Perez . said that she was 'relieved' the judge had given the pair strong . sentences. 'I did not attend . the sentencing as I didn't feel I could cope with being in court with . them - and I didn't feel sure that the judge would understand how . terrifying and scarring the whole experience has been for me, which . again is not something I could face,' she wrote. 'I feel immensely relieved that the judge clearly has understood the severity of the impact this abuse has had on me. 'The damages that have been awarded to me will be going to charity. When this has all sunk in I will decide which charity.'","Isabella Sorley and John Nimmo abused Caroline Criado-Perez online .

"‘Human Barbie’ Valeria Lukyanova has claimed that interracial couples are making the human race uglier and sparking a rise in plastic surgery. The cosmetically-enhanced model, 28, who is from the Ukraine, told GQ magazine: ‘Ethnicities are mixing now, so there’s degeneration, and it didn’t used to be like that. ‘Remember how many beautiful women there were in the 1950s and 1960s, without any surgery? And now, thanks to degeneration, we have this. A Russian marries an Armenian, they have a kid, a cute girl, but she has her dad’s nose. She goes and files it down a little, and it’s all good.’ Scroll down for video . Human Barbie: Valeria Lukyanova has told GQ magazine that she thinks interracial relationships are the reason for a rise in plastic surgery . Michael Idov, who interviewed Ms Lukyanova, branded her a ‘racist space alien’ following her outrageous remarks. Ms Lukyanova also told Mr Idov that the idea of having a family is abhorrent to her. ‘The very idea of having children brings out this deep revulsion in me,’ she said. ‘I’d rather die from torture because the worst thing in the world is to have a family lifestyle.’ Ms Lukyanova first rose to fame in 2012 after her ‘spiritual counseling’ videos became a viral sensation worldwide. Her elfin features sparked controversy, with many wondering how many surgeries she had undergone to achieve her appearance. But . Ms Lukyanova says that she has only received breast implants and that . her appearance is otherwise the result of diet and exercise. Her 18-inch waist, wide-set eyes, diminutive nose, and large breasts appear otherworldly, however. She . told GQ : ‘Everyone wants a slim figure. Everyone gets breasts done. Everyone fixes up their face if it’s not ideal, you know? Everyone . strives for the golden mean. It’s global now.’ Her bizarre appearance was not lost on Mr Idov. ‘Her . mouth is frozen in a vacant half-smile; the teeth are small and almost . translucent. She’s holding a handbag shaped like a lantern. A one-eyed . smiling-skull pin perches on her sky blue top, pushed to the side by the . veritable shelf of silicone around which her whole body seems . arranged.’ Ms Lukyanova has made headlines in the past thanks to bizarre claims that she is ‘not human’ and ‘can time travel’ Other worldly: Ms Lukyanova has previously admitted that she is married and now says that the thought of having children repulses her . She . admitted in 2013 that she believes she is from another planet - . possibly Venus, but she isn't quite sure - but is adamant she isn't . human. 'I come from a . place where only love and joy exist,' she told Vice. 'But I noticed the . media is only interested in negativity: show someone in a bad light, . show someone's mistakes. 'Perhaps . at some point I was an energy vampire, because I constantly received . their negative reactions and enjoyed it. Specifically for them I created . posts that would make them angry.’ More . recently, Ms Lukyanova described how she practices Breatharianism - a . pseudo-science in which people think that they can derive energy from . the sun, rather than food. Former Breatharian practitioners have . suffered from starvation, dehydration, and even death. In . February this year she said: 'In recent weeks I have not been hungry at . all; I'm hoping it's the final stage before I can subsist on air and . light alone.' Ms Lukyanova’s construction worker husband is also her manager. In . August she told The Daily Beast: ‘My husband has known me for more than . ten years.

"The Church of England attracts fewer than 800,000 worshippers to its churches on a typical Sunday, according to new estimates yesterday. Numbers in the pews have fallen to less than half the levels of the 1960s, the count showed. The signs of continuing decline in support for the CofE follow census evidence of a widespread fall in allegiance to Christianity, with numbers calling themselves Christian dropping by more than four million in a decade. Fewer than 800,000 worshippers attend Church of England services on Sundays. Census evidence has revealed a fall in the number of people denoting themselves as Christians. Congregation levels now stand at half the level of the 1960s . The Church's figure for 'usual Sunday attendance', the method used since the 1930s to measure congregations, found CofE churches had 795,800 worshippers on Sundays in 2012. The numbers were 9,000 down on the previous year. They indicate that repeated efforts by the Church to modernise its services and its image - through a series of modern language rewrites of its prayer book, attempts by its leaders to appeal to supposed public concern with poverty, and efforts to make its government more efficient - have not succeeded in drawing young people. Its report yesterday said that research had shown 'there is no single recipe for growth; there are no simple solutions to decline', adding 'the Church must retain its young people if it is to thrive.' Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, leader of the Church of England . Dr Bev Botting, the Church's research chief, said: 'These statistics for 2012 show that weekly attendance over the past decade has not changed significantly. The introduction of cleaner data and more rigorous methodological approaches and analysis means these figures provide a clearer picture of Anglican churchgoing in the decade to 2012.' Church officials abandoned the 'usual Sunday attendance' method of counting as their main measure of congregations in the late 1990s after is showed numbers in the pew had dwindled below a million. It now uses for the headline figure 'average weekly attendance', which takes in people who come to churches on days other than Sunday. The weekly figure averaged 1.05 million in 2012, showing 'no significant change over the past decade.' According to the 2011 national census, the number of Christians fell by 4.1 million over 10 years to 33.2 million - of whom only a third go to church except for wedding, baptisms or funerals. The census found a 45 per cent rise over the same 10 years in numbers who say they have no religion, to 14.1 million in 2001. The decline of religion is at its fastest among young people. Nearly a third, 32 per cent, of those under 25 said on their census forms that they had no religious belief.","Numbers in the pews have fallen to less than half the levels of the 1960s .

"Tory MP Nadine Dorries said English MPs should be given more power over English matters . David Cameron is facing growing calls to ban Scottish MPs from voting on laws which only affect England if the country votes to reject independence on Thursday. Former cabinet minister John Redwood said the House of Commons should sit as an ‘English Parliament’ for most of the week and only let Scottish MPs attend when discussing ‘union’ issues like foreign policy and defence. Outspoken backbencher Nadine Dorries went further, saying: 'Why are we paying them to eat deep-fried mars bars when we can't even get decent health care in this country?' Conservative MPs are concerned that in the wake of a ‘No’ vote on Thursday, the Scottish Parliament will be given sweeping new powers over tax and welfare but MPs from north of the border will still be able to vote on matters which only apply in England. Mr Redwood said Scottish Labour MPs should pledge not to vote on English matters after the independence referendum. Mr Redwood said: ‘As a Scottish parliament is going to have the power to fix income tax in Scotland we need an English parliament to fix the level of income tax in England. ‘I want England to get the same devolution as Scotland and I want England to get the government it votes for. ‘In 2010 we voted for a Conservative government in England and Scottish MPs gave us a coalition. You have to form the English parliament from the English MPs. ‘I want them to meet as an English parliament and have our own English ministers on English issues just as the Scottish parliament meets, but believing in economy I believe I can do both jobs with my colleagues as we do at the moment.’ Mr Redwood said some policy areas, such as foreign affairs, would still be under the remit of a Union parliament. ‘I am asking for justice and balance. I wish Scotland every success with her vote. If she votes to stay in, as I hope she does, she will get more devolved powers, that’s fine by me. ‘I just ask that England gets exactly the same and we are not going to be fobbed off with breaking up and Balkanising our country. ‘We want an English parliament to settle English income tax to match the Scottish parliament settling Scottish income tax.’ Scroll down for video . Ms Dorries said England was subsidising Scotland - allowing them to 'eat deep fried Mars Bars' - while England's NHS suffered . But Scottish Labour MP Dame Anne Begg warned against ‘ad-hoc’ changes to the constitution in the wake of this week’s poll. She said additional powers for English MPs needed to be considered as part of a ‘coherent approach’ alongside more devolution for Scotland and Wales. She said: 'We’re [Scottish MPs] not going to have our extra powers immediately so I think it has to be part of that broader discussion.’ She questioned the plan set out by Mr Redwood. Dame Anne said: ‘I think the trouble with John’s proposal is he anticipates turning what I think of as the UK Parliament into an English Parliament. ‘I think that’s important, that there has to be a UK Parliament in order to do all the things that you just mentioned – the foreign affairs, defence and things like that. ‘I think that from John’s point of view and indeed the people who feel that there’s a democratic deficit with regard to England should actually look at the way that we’ve done it in Scotland, which is through constitutional conventions and building a broader consensus. ‘I have to say, we’re four days away from knowing the result of the referendum. I think the timing of this is not the best. ‘I would much rather we were putting our energies into making sure Scotland did remain part of the Union because the decision will be different on Friday, depending on what the outcome of the referendum is.’","The PM is facing calls to ban Scottish MPs from voting on 'English' laws .

"Free: Kristle Vandever, 44, has escaped criminal charges despite admitting to having sexual relations with students . An elementary school teacher who admitted having sexual relations with students has escaped prison after prosecutors declined to bring charges against her. Kristle Vandever, 44, resigned two years ago after the allegations first emerged - but she has only just had her teaching licence revoked. Shortly after quitting, the 21-year veteran wrote an email admitting: 'I just can't help wanting these hot young boys... and they want me.' She also appeared to imply that she could have faced legal action if her victims had spoken up as she wrote, 'no witnesses coming forward'. Vandever taught English as a second language at McNary Heights Elementary School in Umatilla, Oregon, having qualified as a teacher in 1989, according to the Hermiston Herald. After an investigation into allegations she had had sex with students was launched in early 2010, she resigned from the school in May 2010. Just weeks after her resignation, she sent an email from her work account saying: 'No jail for me and that is only because of luck... no witnesses coming forward. 'He said he was of legal age, but he lied. I just can't help wanting these hot young boys... and they want me. 'Who am I to spoil a young man's fantasy. Damn.' However, after a lengthy police investigation, the local District Attorney declined to file criminal charges against Vandever. The state's Teacher Standards and Practices Commission launched its own inquiry into the teacher's behaviour, and found a number of serious offences. Resigned: Vandever stepped down from her job at McNary Heights Elementary School in May 2010 . A report concluded that she had performed oral sex on 'one or more' students in her car, as well as giving students alcohol. It also found that video of Vandever engaged in sexual activity with a boy was filmed on a cell phone and passed round other students. Last month, the teacher had her licence withdrawn as a result of the findings. She did not appeal against the revocation or the conclusions of the report.","Kristle Vandever resigned from elementary school but escaped prosecution .

"New York's largest hotel, the Hilton Midtown, will be discontinuing room service from August. Crain's reports that hungry or thirsty guests will instead have to head down to the lobby where a self-service cafeteria called Herb n’ Kitchen opened this month. A spokesperson for the 50-year-old establishment, which charges an average of more than $200 a night, said the move reflects the changing 'needs, wants and lifestyle' of customers. Growing trend: New York's largest hotel, the Hilton Midtown, will be discontinuing room service from August . In 2012, room service represented just . 1.2per cent of total hotel revenue, down from 1.3per cent the previous year, according a survey conducted by PKF Hospitality Research. Analysts suggest that high prices are to blame for the trend. At the Hilton Midtown, located on . 6th Avenue between West 53rd and 54th street, a plate of three . scrambled eggs for breakfast is listed at $22.50 while a Cobb Salad . costs $24.75. In small print, the menu also states that for each order there is an additional 15per cent service charge and an in-room dining fee of $5.50 per person. Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry . analyst, explained to NBC . that in cities where 24-hour dining and take-out services are available, room service has become obsolete. Convenient but costly: Many travelers are put off room service because of high prices (stock image) He said that a lobby cafe at the Hilton would help it to 'win back some of the business it may be losing to outside . establishments.' Some also see the end of the labor-intensive amenity as a way for the 2,000-room venue to save money and more than 50 members of staff are expected to lose their jobs. But Mr Harteveldt warned that the move could also put the hotel’s status in danger. 'There are so many hotels to choose . from. If everyone is offering room service, I don’t know why I would pay . the same rate with no service' 'It will be tough for the Hilton to . call itself ""full service"" without room service, even though it offers . many other amenities,' he said. 'If room service is a requirement to . earn a four star rating from independent organizations like AAA, . Hilton's move may put [that] rating in jeopardy, unless the hotel can . obtain an exemption.' For many regulars the news has come as a blow. Michael Henry, 78, an author and publisher, told The New York Times that he likes to have coffee waiting when he steps out of the shower in the morning. 'I think it’s dehumanizing the service. It’s what I call catering to the lowest common denominator,' he complained. While Maria-Chiara Della Valle, 29, an engineer from London, said she counted on room service when she arrived late at night and was jet-lagged and would not be returning to the Hilton if it was no longer on offer. 'There are so many hotels to choose from. If everyone is offering room service, I don’t know why I would pay the same rate with no service,' she explained.","The 2,000-room Hilton Midtown has opened a self-service cafeteria instead ."
"The views from the white cliffs of the Sussex coast have remained unchanged for millions of years. But visitors to the South Downs, drawn there for the unbroken vista of rolling hills and choppy seas, could soon be faced with the sight of scores of wind turbines towering above the waves. Energy Secretary Ed Davey has approved a £2billion project to build 175 turbines nine miles out to sea, each standing nearly 700 feet tall. Opponents, including the National Trust and the South Downs National Park, say the view from landmarks such as Beachy Head (above) and the Seven Sisters cliffs will be spoiled for ever . He insists the Rampion wind farm, set for completion in 2018, is essential because it will power 450,000 homes with green energy. Mr Davey, a Liberal Democrat, said: ‘This project is great news for Sussex, providing green jobs as well as driving business opportunities right across the country in a sector with a clear roadmap for long-term growth.’ But opponents, including the National Trust and the South Downs National Park, say the view from landmarks such as Beachy Head and the Seven Sisters cliffs, and towns including Brighton and Eastbourne, will be spoiled for ever. Depending on the terms of the contract that German developer E.on signs with the Government, it can be expected to receive up to £200million a year in subsidies, critics say. The National Trust, which owns sections of the Sussex coast, has formally objected to the project. In a letter to the Government’s planning inspectorate, the Trust said: ‘The beauty of the coastline matters to the nation. ‘The impact of the proposal on the designated assets of the National Park and heritage coast, on the landscape and seascape character of the area, on important visual receptors and on key National Trust sites is considered to be major.’ The decision was handled by Mr Davey and his energy department because it is considered a major infrastructure project, providing a large chunk of the nation’s electricity needs. Ed Davey and his Liberal Democrat colleagues are strong advocates of wind power, despite common objections from people who live near planned sites . Mr Davey and his Liberal Democrat colleagues are strong advocates of wind power, despite common objections from people who live near planned sites. The same cannot be said of certain members of his Coalition partners. A report published by the Campaign to Protect Rural England today reveals that Eric Pickles, the Conservative Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, has single-handedly slashed the number of on-shore wind farms and large solar arrays given planning permission in the last year. A year ago Mr Pickles announced he would personally oversee all wind and solar planning appeal cases. Since then the number of planning approvals for solar and wind farms has fallen from 80 per cent to 60 per cent. Mr Davey and Mr Pickles are known to disagree on their approach to renewable energy and the planning system - but at the moment each are confined by their own remit. The Energy Secretary has influence when a project is deemed to be a national infrastructure matter, while Mr Pickles can only intervene if an application is taken to appeal. In 2013, Eric Pickles announced he would personally oversee all wind and solar planning appeal cases. Nick Clack, senior energy campaigner at CPRE, said: ‘We applaud the Government for taking action to stop renewable energy projects that would have a damaging effect on the countryside. ‘But without a clearer and more strategic approach to planning in the first place, we’re relying on one minister to intervene and protect our landscapes. ‘Planning policy must be further clarified to make sure that the need for renewable energy does not automatically override environmental protection and the wishes of local communities. ‘The current approach to planning renewable projects, that are needed to produce low-carbon energy, is chaotic and unsustainable. ‘With the pressure for renewable energy in the countryside only set to increase, we need to see further improvements in planning policy and incentives for brownfield and commercial sites.’","Energy Secretary Ed Davey has approved the £2billion project .

"A man who discovered that the son and daughter he raised into their teenage years were not his has been awarded £25,000 in damages after suing his ex-wife for deceit. Richard Rodwell was a loving father to Adam and Laura until his marriage to their mother Helen broke down. After the divorce he paid  regular child maintenance for more than four years, from his salary as a factory manager. Happy family: Adam and Laura are all smiles during a swimming session with loving 'father' Richard. Both children were fathered by different men . But in 2008 Mr Rodwell ordered DNA tests after hearing rumours about his daughter’s paternity – and the results showed that each child was fathered by a different man. Following the results, the children cut off all contact with him. He claims his ex-wife turned them against him. Yesterday, Mr Rodwell’s solicitor, Roger Terrell, said: ‘The court treated it as akin to bereavement, awarding a similar sum to the one you would receive if your child died in an accident, which is £11,800. 'I heard whispers, so I needed to know' ‘I think in this case, the county court judge went further than that because of the level of deceit and the fact that Mr  Rodwell’s new wife is too old to give him children, so he has lost his chance of fatherhood.’ Speaking for the first time about the controversial case, Mr Rodwell, 46, from Peterborough, said: ‘It’s like a bereavement because I have lost the children I believed were mine. ‘I treated them both as if they were my own. I was there at their births, went to their Nativity plays and helped them with school homework. ‘I can’t stop thinking about the children as they were my life.  I always wanted children and grandchildren and now it’s too late in life for me. ‘The children were the most important people in my life, and now they have gone. Wedding day: Richard with Helen at King's Lynn Register Office in June 1990. After the couple divorced in 2004, Helen was granted custody of the children and Mr Rodwell paid a total of £15,600 in maintenance . ‘But I had to do the DNA tests. There was a whispering campaign going on that the children weren’t mine and I needed to know. I couldn’t live with the uncertainty any longer.’ Mr Rodwell started dating Helen, now 44, in 1989 when they were both fruit-packers at a factory near King’s Lynn, Norfolk. They moved into a caravan together and in 1990 married at King’s Lynn Register Office. They had 60 guests at the reception at a village hall. 'She has never even said sorry' Laura was born in 1992, with Mr Rodwell present at the birth and signing the birth certificate. Two years later Adam was born, with Mr Rodwell still  having no reason to suspect that Helen had been unfaithful. Mr Rodwell said: ‘My life seemed complete. We had moved into a house, I was happily married, had a good job and two healthy children – what more could I want?’ But by 2004 the marriage  was struggling. Mr Rodwell explained: ‘Helen was disappearing for several days without telling me where she was going.  I only found out from used train and coach tickets I discovered. ‘I would collect the children from school as usual and walk into the house and it would be empty with no note or anything. Helen would go to places such as Newcastle or Manchester, and if I asked why she had gone there she would say, “Nothing to do with you.” ’ So sad: Richard and his second wife Trudi. His relationship with Laura and Adam has 'all gone' When the couple divorced in 2004, Helen was granted custody of the children and for the next four years Mr Rodwell paid £300 a month maintenance for both children. His total bill was £15,600. Four years after the divorce he began hearing rumours that Laura, now 20, was not his daughter. Mr Rodwell said: ‘People said Laura didn’t look like me and that Helen had been seeing a teacher who lived next door on the caravan park. ‘I confronted Helen on the phone but she insisted I was Laura’s father. Finally I said  I wanted DNA testing.’ The DNA test was done by mouth swab and when the result came back  Mr Rodwell was stunned. He said: ‘When I saw the letter stating that  I wasn’t Laura’s father I just broke down. ‘When I phoned Helen we had an argument and she just said, “What did you expect.” She didn’t even say sorry.’ Mr Rodwell didn’t tell Laura but he described in court documents how her attitude changed towards him. He said: ‘She didn’t come to see me and if I saw her in the street she would make obscene gestures with her  fingers and on one occasion even kicked my car.’ Laura also posted a cruel message on Facebook that read: ‘I hate you so much, I reali [sic] loved you so when you called me your little angel I take it you was just saying it and you start all that after 16 years you have ruined mine and adams life I hope your happy for what you have put us through!!’ Mr Rodwell also decided to have a DNA test done to check Adam’s paternity. ‘I still have no idea who is Adam’s father,’ he said. ‘For nearly 17 years I cared for Laura as my daughter and for Adam for over 14 years and now it’s all gone. It’s so sad. ‘I would have been happy to have a close relationship with them as a stepfather but Helen wouldn’t allow this and told them to keep away from me.’ Mr Rodwell was awarded compensation in 2011 of £12,500 for each child, and costs of £25,000. He also won a court order forcing his ex-wife to move out of the marital home, which is now up for sale for £119,995. Mrs Rodwell yesterday declined to comment.","Richard Rodwell was a loving father until his marriage broke down .

"Taking a wrong turn into a lake would usually require an embarrassed call to your insurer. Not so if you're driving the Panther, which can switch from car to boat in just 15 seconds. The amphibious vehicle, which can hit speeds of 80mph-plus on land and up to 45mph in water, is the brainchild of Californian manufacturer WaterCar. Founder Dave March set-up the company back in 1999 with the aim of shattering the world record for the fastest amphibious vehicle. Drive on water: The Panther, created by Californian manufacturer WaterCar,  can go from car to boat in 15 seconds . In demand: The $155,000 (£96,000) amphibious vehicle has an 18 month backlog of orders . And in 2010 he did exactly that when WaterCar's Python model reached a top speed of 60mph (52 knots) on water. The Python was never sold to the public due to its high production costs, but a new model - The Panther - went on sale in July 2013 and the company now has an 18 month backlog of orders. The Panther costs $155,000 (£96,000) and features a lightweight chromoly steel chassis and fibreglass hull, as well as a hydraulic off-road suspension which retracts the wheels in under eight seconds. Off road: The Panther reaches speeds of 80mph on land and 45mph in the water . And the car comes equipped with a 3.7 litre V6 engine - meaning that when it comes to speed, it's more than a match for it's more traditional sea-fairing companions. Its unique amphibious nature has made it a must-have status symbol and WaterCar have received an influx of orders from the super-rich, including Silicon Valley billionaires and the crown prince of Dubai - who is reported to own several. WaterCar spokesman Michael March, 30, said: 'We have sold cars to some of the wealthiest and powerful people imaginable. Development: A 2010 model, The Python, could reach up to 60mph in the water, but was too expensive to produce for public sale . Lifestyles of the rich and famous: Orders have been placed by everyone from the Crown Prince of Dubai to Silicon Valley billionaires . 'You never know who is sending in a deposit until we begin building the car for that somebody and realise who they are. 'Most requests have been colour schemes that match personal helicopters, mega yachts, luxury cars, county colors, and even just plain and subtle so that nobody would even know the car is amphibious.' The Panther is fully customisable - meaning the buyer has control over everything from hull colour to paint, interior, dashboard, gauges, steering wheel and seats. March added: 'The best part about the Panther is it drives better than most boats on water and can travel more places on land than most cars. 'Make it match the chopper': Super-rich clients have requested paint jobs to match their mega yachts, helicopters and luxury cars . Multi-talented: The Panther 'drives better than most boats on water and can travel more places on land than most cars', says WaterCar . 'The design process has not been easy. There are no books and there has been little to no research on amphibious technology. There have been thousands of attempts at amphibious vehicles but we have literally had to start from nothing. 'I'd say the biggest problem we faced was getting a car meant for land to plane on water like a boat. That is no easy task. 'It has taken much longer than anticipated but it feels amazing. We set out to design and build an amazing vehicle and we have done just that. There is no other vehicle in the world like it.'","Vehicle created by Californian manufacturer WaterCar .

"Australian supermodel and Victoria's Secret Angel Miranda Kerr has swapped lacy lingerie for a black and fuchsia shift dress, modelling the new uniform for Australian airline Qantas. But the flight attendants expected to wear the new attire while working on flights have complained that it is too sexy, impractically tight, and unflattering on anyone who doesn't have the enviably slim curves of Orlando Bloom's ex-wife. Speaking about the Martin Grant-designed uniforms - which Qantas ambassador Kerr, 30, first modelled in April - one domestic short-haul flight attendant told Australia's Daily Telegraph: 'The uniforms are really tight and they are simply not practical for the very physical job we have to do.' Scroll down for video . Miranda Kerr modelling the new uniform for Qantas air stewards, designed by Martin Grant . When first revealed by Qantas CEO Alan Joyce, staff complained the uniforms were 'too sexy' and uncomfortable. One stewardess added: 'The uniform looks fantastic on Miranda Kerr but unfortunately we don't all look like her,"" said another attendant. 'Hosties range in age from their 20s to . their 60s and a lot of the older ones don't want to wear tight-fitting . uniforms,' she continued. 'We like the current Peter Morrissey-designed uniforms.

Over 12,000 Qantas employees will wear the new uniform from Thursday, despite the airline having recently announced plans to cut 1000 jobs in a bit to save AUS$2bn over then next three years. A spokeswoman for the Flight Attendants Association of Australia National Division said union members had been in touch with concerns about the new dresses. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, she said: 'We have asked the airline to tweak the uniform a little to accommodate some concerns. 'Once it comes in and the crew are wearing it we will be having more discussions. If there are more issues, obviously we would expect the company to iron them out.' But a Qantas spokeswoman said several crew members had been on a panel which gave input into the design, and that the new clothes had been trialled by 75 members of staff who wore int on the job for several weeks. She said: 'The feedback we've had from staff on the new uniform has been overwhelmingly positive. 'There are bound to be some adjustments needed as we roll out multiple pieces to 12,000 people, but it's been going very smoothly and there's a lot of excitement.'","Miranda Kerr modelled the Martin Grant-designed uniforms in April .

"This photograph shows Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury . Bishops have agreed that married gay couples can ask for special prayers in the Church of England after their wedding. But, under new guidelines released today, the Church's House of Bishops has said that gay priests will be banned from getting married despite the fact it becomes legal in the UK next month. One CoE vicar, who got engaged to his partner of 14 years yesterday, has today insisted the ban will not affect him and he will go ahead with his plans despite the potential consequences. The new 'pastoral guidance' comes despite the fact rules allow for those in civil partnerships to become priests and bishops if they claim to be celibate. And the rules state that gay non-clergy who marry can continue to receive communion within the Church. The CoE will not be carrying out same-sex weddings, but gay couples can ask for special prayers from their priests. This, though, cannot be referring to as a 'blessing'. They must have a form of 'pastoral discussion', but the priest may not subject the couple to 'questioning' about their private life. They . say that it would be inappropriate ‘conduct’ for deacons, priests and . bishops to enter same-sex marriage. And lay members who do so will be barred . from ordination. In the guidance, the House of Bishops said that clergy should be allowed to ‘argue for a change in its teaching and human sexuality’. But it added: ‘Getting married to someone of the same sex would, however, clearly be at variance with the teaching of the Church of England. ‘The declarations made by clergy and the canonical requirements as to their manner of life do have real significance and need to be honoured as a matter of integrity.’ The CoE said it was not allowing ‘those who are in a same sex marriage to be ordained to any of the three orders of ministry’. The rules state that gay non-clergy who marry can continue to receive communion within the Church . It said: ‘In addition it considers that it would not be appropriate conduct for someone in holy orders to enter into a same sex marriage, given the need for clergy to model the Church’s teaching in their lives.’ The prohibition of gay marriage for priests could lead to a rebellion from clergy who choose to marry after the Same-Sex Marriage Act comes into force next month. Local bishops would be forced to discipline them, effectively defrocking them for tying the knot. According to the Telegraph, the Church is already preparing for ‘martyrs’ ready to challenge the rules. One man who has vowed to marry despite today's guidelines released by the House of Bishops is Andrew Cain, vicar at St Mary's church in Kilburn, North London. He yesterday proposed to his boyfriend, Stephen Foreshaw, for Valentine's Day. ‘I woke up thinking, great I’m engaged. And then I saw these new guidelines,' he told MailOnline. 'It is irritating. But it is not going to change anything. People will get married and then they will have to decide what they will then do.' Mr Cain, 50, and Mr Foreshaw, 40, have been in a relationship 14 years and the vicar decided to propose ahead of the Same-Sex Marriage Act next month. He said the new guidance makes the Church 'even more of a laughing stock' and described those who passed the rules as 'bullies'. Mr Cain revealed that he and others had been told that they had the support of the Church, and were not expecting the guidelines to be released. ‘To treat them like this publicly is dreadful. All of the bishops will know one [a gay priest]. They are  telling people in private ""we support you"" and then publicly saying the opposite,' he said. 'It is absolutely shocking. On one level they are doing what the Church did to women in the past.' He said that when he gets married, it will be expensive and complicated for the Church to discipline him. Mr Cain said he would expect to get a formal letter - a monition - acting as a public rebuke from the Church, but was not sure what would happen beyond that.","House of Bishops agrees to allow gay couples to ask for special prayers from their priest following wedding .

"'Absolutely no one is listening to your cry for assistance. It's the ultimate in dehumanisation.' It has been a long journey for Munjed Al Muderis. Fleeing the oppressive regime of Saddam Hussein's Iraq, and crossing the seas to Australia in a boat headed for Christmas Island, the young man found himself living in the infamous Curtin Detention Centre. Now an Australian citizen and a pioneering surgeon enabling soldiers to walk again, Al Muderis's story is as extraordinary as it is harrowing. 'There are always two sides to every story,' Dr Al Muderis told Daily Mail Australia. 'I wanted to tell the story of living through the reign of Saddam Hussein, and at the same time show the harshness inside detention centres in Australia.' Dr Munjed Al Muderis fled Iraq in 1999 after a squad of military police ordered his surgical team to mutilate the ears of amry deserters . In 1999, two years after qualifying as a surgical resident, Dr Al Muderis was wrapped up in a seemingly routine day working in a Baghdad hospital, when a squad of military police marched into the operating theatre and demanded that the surgical team amputate the ears of army and draft deserters, on orders from Saddam Hussein himself. The head of surgery refused, and was dragged outside to be executed. 'If anyone else shares his view, step forward. Otherwise carry on,' said one of the military 'thugs'. Dr Al Muderis saw his three options: carry out the operations, refuse to perform them and face the consequences, or hide. Seeking refuge in a hidden toilet cubicle in the women's locker room, all Dr Al Muderis knew was that he had to escape the barbaric regime of Saddam Hussein which had ripped apart the country he had grown up in. Dr Al Muderis saw his three options: carry out the operations, refuse to perform them and face the consequences, or hide.

As a teenager on a high school trip to Habbaniyah, with a skate board and boom box . Dr Al Munjed, third from left, having lunch with surgical training colleagues in Baghdad . Crossing the Jordan border with $22,000 strapped to his stomach, he made a snap decision which would change his life permanently: he chose to board a boat carrying more than 150 passengers, heading towards Australia, away from one kind of danger and into the arms of another. Stripped of his name, and instead identified by a number, Dr Al Muderis was detained in Curtin Detention Centre in Western Australia for ten months. 'Like everyone else in Curtin, I felt completely lost, isolated and helpless,' he wrote. 'As an absolute stranger in a foreign land, with no contacts and no one to care for you or offer support, that doesn't give you a feeling of welcome or belonging.' In the sweltering heat of the Kimberley Desert, the passionate advocate for education acted as an intermediary between other detainees and the guards, starting a shanty school for children in the detention centre to stave off boredom. Describing the inadequate health care, food and living conditions, Dr Al Muderi said, 'We sensed the detention centre management was trying to deprive us of everything, including our names, in an effort to force us to go back to the countries we came from.' The chronic overcrowding, racial abuse, high levels of self-mutilation and suicide attempts, and long application processes were condemned in 2001 in an inquiry commissioned by the Howard federal government. Curtin Detention Centre, where Dr Al Mujed was detained for 10 months in 1999 . The refugees were forced to sleep on stretchers, keeping their belongings in plastic bags . Surprisingly, Dr Al Muderi is not against mandatory detention, but his descriptions of the lengths to which his fellow detainees went to protest their living conditions highlight his plea for more humane approaches to the issue of asylum seekers. 'Refugees should be investigated or detained, at least until they are cleared of diseases, and until the government is sure they aren't carrying fundamental views of potential terrorists,' 'But this can be done in a much more humane and cost effective way. Asylum seekers should not be detained indefinitely, and they should be given access to education, in order to learn Australian values.' 'I also believe that no child should be detained. I've seen children spending 10 months in detention without learning one sentence. That is wrong.' After being charged with inciting a breakout of detainees at Curtin Detention Centre, Dr Al Muderi was transferred to Broome Jail, and describes the fleeting contact he had with his mother, calling her to let her know he was safe- although in a maximum security prison. After a lengthy trial, he was cleared of the charges, processed by the government and found himself a legal refugee. His immediate course of action was to find a job, and within two months of being released from the detention centre was working as a medical practitioner. 'My motivation for writing the book was I felt that people deserved to see a different side of refugees. Some people who come over can have a positive influence and input into society.' After undergoing a gruelling four-year orthopaedic training program, Dr Al Muderi excelled in the field of hip and knee replacement surgery, forming his own thoughts on the next stages of 'osseointegration', or the process of making bones 'whole' again. During his time at Austin Hospital in Melbourne, he fulfilled his dream of becoming an orthopedic robotic limb surgeon, working with state-of-the-art technology to assist those who have lost limbs in combat. Precisely a decade after Dr Al Muderi landed on Christmas Island, one of his patients tragically lost both of his legs after stepping on an insurgent bomb in southern Afghanistan. Michael Swain, a British rifleman, was only 20 years old and two months into his tour with Britain’s 3 Rifles in the Helmand Province when his legs were blown off. Swain spent three years in rehab, spending 18 months learning how to walk with prosthetic legs, but was frustrated with his lack of mobility. Performing the intricate two-part procedure on British rifleman Michael Swain . Michael Swain taking his first steps on his new robotic legs at Macquarie University Hospital in early 2014 . At the University of Sydney, awaiting the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons Fellowship exam results . After a long battle, he managed to convince the Ministry of Defence to sponsor an osseointegration procedure, after meeting a patient of Dr Al Muderis’ at a clinic in England who had undergone the surgery. Swain flew to Australia to have titanium implants and adaptors fitted to the artificial bone that fits directly onto a robotic leg, all by an Iraqi refugee. The procedure is what has garnered the most attention for Dr Al Muderis, as the pioneering surgery sees bone and muscle grow around the titanium on the bone end,  creating an essentially bionic leg. Dr Al Muderis was invited by the Queen of England to attend the ceremony in which Rifleman Swain received his MBE medal, and was able to see for himself the benefits of osseointegration beyond the procedure.

"Imagine a world where a handheld gadget scans your body and diagnoses illnesses in seconds - reducing hospital visits and potentially saving your life. It may sound like the work of science fiction but engineers in California have taken their lead from the Star Trek franchise and developed a real-life version of the show’s medical tricorder. The Scanadu Scout can read a person’s temperature, heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and more, simply being held against their forehead. Scroll down for video . Another device, called the Scanadu Scout, pictured, works in a similar way to the Star Trek tricorder. It is held on a person's temple for 10 seconds. Built-in sensors then establish body temperature and heart rate . A Tricorder is a scanning device used by Starfleet personnel in the Star Trek universe. There are two variations; a regular (engineering) tricorder and a medical tricorder. Medical tricorders are used to wirelessly scan a patient, either in a ‘sick bay’ on a star ship or during an away mission. The advanced scanning tool can determine a patient’s medical status and readings, and allows doctors to quickly and easily diagnose their condition without an intensive or invasion examination. It was developed by Scanadu’s CEO Walter De Brouwer, 56, at Nasa’s Ames Research Centre in California. A prototype of the Scout was first unveiled in 2012 and the latest model is on display at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Vegas. The portable electronic device contains a variety of different sensors, plus a microphone on the top of the gadget, that can read five vital signs. These include body temperature, heart rate, oximetry (blood oxygen levels), ECG waves, heart rate variability and pulse wave transit time (PWTT) - the time it takes for a heartbeat to reach somewhere else in a person’s body. PWTT is related to blood pressure. Its makers claim the device is 99 per cent accurate in less than 10 seconds.

Now researchers are creating real-life versions . When it is being used a few times every day, the battery lasts for about a week, the firm says. The gadget was expected to go on sale by the end of 2013 but the company has not announced when it will be widely available released. It will need to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S before it can go on sale, but the company is said to be 'actively seeking this approval.' As part of this approval process, Scanadu intends to send working protypes to 10,000 people in March. The Scout is expected to cost around $199 (£120) and will be available to consumers. According to De Brouwer: ‘It’s no accident that doctor visits start with checking your vital signs. ‘Scanadu Scout provides you with access to valuable data which your body provides every day. Use it  to analyse, track, and trend your vitals with unprecedented simplicity.’ At last year's CES, Qualcomm set up a $10m (£6.5m) Tricorder X Prize. The prize is on offer to whoever can create and market a Star Trek-like medical 'tricorder capable of recording 'key health metrics and diagnosing a set of 15 diseases'.

"Rats that can be taught to lie down on command, ostriches that can be ridden by actors and the building of two £178,000 life-size spaceships. These are just a smattering of the incredible suggestions put forward at production meetings in 1976 a year ahead of the making of the first Star Wars film a year later. Revealing notes from discussions between key figures on January . 13, January 26 and February 13 . shine a light on the staggering level of planning that was required to . produce the ground-breaking sci-fi movie which cost a reported . $11million to make in 1977– around £53million in today’s money. Details: . This intriguing note illustrates the breadth of planning detail . required ahead of the multi-million dollar film . Big job: The note reveals that jawas, pictured left, - short rodent-like natives of Luke Skywalker's home planet of . tatooine - are to be cast on location, two Tuscan raiders, known as Sand . People are needed and the man behind it all Star Wars director George Lucas, right . The minutes of the meetings also illustrate the extraordinary level of detail director George Lucas and his team went to in order to bring to life the imaginary world in a ‘galaxy far, far away’. Attending the meeting were, among others, Hollywood producer Gary Kurtz, and legendary special effects man John Stears credited with creating the Jedi light sabres and James Bond’s legendary Aston Martin DB5. One page records set lists 227 to 250 including interiors of the Death Star, externals of a pirate starship and a prison cell and garbage room on the planet of Alderaan. Other notes illustrate the huge undertaking involved in creating life-size X-Wing and Y-Wing fighter ships at a cost of £27,000 each or roughly £178,000 in today’s money. Iconic: The full-scale model of the X-Wing fighter used in the Star Wars films. Produced in England for £178,000 . Huge . undertaking: This letter details the work involved in creating the . Y-Wing fighter ship on location in England. It says steel will be used . in the construction, with the ship being made in three parts to ensure . it can be transported and constructed more easily on site . Expensive . business: The estiimated cost of designing, building and transporting . the Y-fighter ship is quoted at £27,000 plus VAT in 1976, taking into account inflation that equates around £178,470 today . Tight deadlines: This is the letter that confirmed the final look of Luke's X-Wing fighter. A full-size aircraft was to be built in just a few months at a cost of £178,000 . Challenge: . This note from International Engineering Services confirms that the . company is willing to build the iconic X-Wing fighter and details the . necessary specifications . Other extracts discuss the possibility of using animals in the production. Under the heading ‘Live Animals’ it is recorded that ‘we are now searching for a source for ostriches which can be ridden’. Rats are put forward as possible ‘actors’ for the banther creatures with John Stears saying they could be taught to lie down on command. The note also states that ‘Gary Kurtz suggested giving rats injections. 'Bruce Sharman thought stuffed ones might be a good idea. John Barry enquired how long from babies to adults for training rats.’ Working . with animals: This note references an unsuccessful mission by John . Holmes to find live animals and efforts to source ostriches that can be . ridden . Ostrich? A screen grab from Star Wars. The production notes suggest that ostriches could be used to play the parts . Under . pressure: Special effects expert John Stears says the method . chosen for creating the robot R2D2 'is viable'. It also records . producer Gary Kurtz suggestion of using rodents to create the banthers . with John Stears suggesting he could teach them to lie down. An ostrich . is also put forward as a possible prop . Other issues raised include a problem with gold robot C3PO’s (minuted as 'Threepio’) right arm and plans to test ‘light swords’ later to be known as light sabres. These extremely rare Star Wars production notes provide a window into the behind the scenes planning for the film and it is thought that only creator George Lucas has another copy. Now the extraordinary collection, including the X-Wing delivery invoice, will go up for auction to a global fan base at the Greenwich Auction Partnership tomorrow. They are set to go under the hammer for a starting price of £2,000 but such is their rarity they could fetch far more. The fascinating extracts cover a wide range of topics from travel arrangements to Tunisia to ideas for what R2D2 should look like. Massive . budget: This note talks about 'laser swords' later to be renamed as the . iconic light sabres. Other mentions of note include Luke Skywalker's . legendary land speeder on which he hovered across tatooine and the need . for two versions of R2D2 - a mechanical one and an actor controlled one . So much to think about: R2D2 left, who was played by Kenny Baker and right one of the locations chosen to film Star Wars . Logistics: . The number of locations required is mind boggling. Outdoor sets range . from a power station to a cave dwelling with enormous studio sets . including a Masasi Temple and a Star Destroyer control room . Referring to the iconic Death Star end scene some surprising problems are flagged up and it appears that a humble Datsun car was to be transformed into an intergalactic fighter. The note reads: 'John Stears bought a model Datsun car to show the meeting. Gary Kurtz said that one model of the size of the Datsun would be needed and three smaller ones (for the ‘Death Star’ sequence) would be needed, and that these should move fast in comparison to other things in the shot.' Costs continue to be a factor as the minutes reveal the team plan to decide whether to use a massive RAF Hercules or a BA Vanguard to get equipment to Tunisia, the Hercules was listed at £9,000 just one way. Spaceship: A Datsun car like this one was sourced to be a spaceship in the scene with the Death Star . Other world: The creation of the Death Star proved to be a huge undertaking, as did the many interior sets required . Creating . another world: The set list is almost unending including a pirate . starship, an imperial fighter cockpit and several different views of the . Death Star . John Barry, the legendary British set designer, who died of meningitis during the making of the second film, is also mentioned: 'John Barry stated that the ‘robot meeting’ was successful and that the five robots are coming along O.K. ‘George Lucas is now happy with ‘Threepio’.' Part of the file mentions how the team encountered issues with a problem with C- 3PO’s elbows, saying John Barry is unhappy with how they work. Robert Dodd, owner of the Greenwich Auction Partnership, said: 'I am positive there isn’t another collection of these anywhere, they would have been such a disposable thing. The only guy who might have a copy of these is George Lucas. 'I’m putting them in for between £2- 2,500, but a serious collector might pay absolutely anything. The sky’s the limit.' The collectors item has already attracted a huge amount of attention from Star Wars lovers all over the country, and would be sure to cheer up any fan feeling a little on the Dark-side. Making progress: This enlightening note gives an update on the progress of the production including plans for testing of the famous 'laser swords' or light sabres . Bomber: The 'Why' Wing rebel alliance bomber spaceship which was built alongside the full scale X-Wing ship in England . Dreamers: Special effects man John Stears, left, who is credited with inventing the light sabre and producer Gary Kurtz, right . Transportation: This note talks about the cost of using a Hercules airfreighter as against a British Airways Vanguard. Details of revealing a couple of hands and arms from the cloaks of dead jawas are mentioned as well as 12 extra costumes and eye pieces . Testing times: In addition to the vast array of props required bits of numerous technical kit and testing was required . Robot issues: This note reveals that there were problems with the air conditioning unit within C3PO's suit and that Luke and his auntie and uncle should have a deeper than normal tan with Ben Kenobi having a 'leathery look' Timings: This note talks about the logistics of getting the right props in the right places at the right times such as Luke's speeder and interesting that ten different versions of R2D2 would be required . Famous figures: Those attending the crucial meeting on Friday, February 13th, 1976, included legendary producer Gary Kurtz and special effects man John Stears . Pulling out all the stops: A 4-wheel drive vehicle could be acquired from the Tunisian Army to move palm trees . Options for R2D2: This note from a meeting on January 23rd, 1976, talks about a second model for R2D2, Jack Purvis - the partner of actor Kenny Baker. It also talks about the requirement of three model Datsun cars for the Death Star sequence which would move 'fast' in comparison with the other things in the shot .

"A white supremacist appeared at court on Monday dressed in full Nazi uniform as he tried to convince a judge that he was a good father - despite having named one of his children Adolf. Heath Campbell, who had four children, asked the judge to be allowed to see his 18-month-old son Hons. The self-proclaimed Nazi, from New Jersey, has given three of his children Nazi-inspired names but claims he is fit to be a father and has never abused them. Scroll down for video . Fascist statement: Heath Campbell, 40, appeared at a New Jersey court today to try to reclaim custody of his children, wearing full Nazi regalia and accompanied by fellow Nazi Bethanie White . Full regalia: Heath Campbell, appeared at a New Jersey court earlier this month, in a Nazi outfit to convince a judge that he was a good father and should have custody of his children . For more videos, please go to NBC 10 . Campbell, a swastika tattoo clearly showing on his neck, told NBC10: 'I'm going to tell the judge, I love my children. I wanna be a father, let me be it. 'Let me prove to the world that I am a good father.' He said that he had never abused his children and had only named them. He has not seen his children in two years and the eldest three have been adopted. The 40-year-old white supremacist appeared at a hearing in Hunterdon County Family Court in Flemington, NJ this morning. His regalia included knee-high black boots and swastika patches. He told the TV station that whether wearing his Nazi uniform might sway the judge's decision, depended on the judge. Heath and Deborah Campbell, pictured with the son they named Adolf Hitler, the couple have since separated . Rescued: Adolf Hitler, right, and his sister Aryan Nation were taken into custody in 2009 and have since been adopted . Bethanie White, a member of his organization 'Hitler's Order', was with Campbell at court - also covered in swastikas. Adolf Hitler Campbell, six, and his younger sisters Joycelynn Aryan Nation, five, and Honszlynn Hinler, four, were taken into custody in January 2009. State officials also took another son, Hons Campbell, from his parents Heath and Deborah Campbell just hours after he was born in November 2011. A court denied the Campbells' appeal to have their children returned last year. White supremacist Campbell, his swastika tattoo on show, said he wanted to show the world he could be a good father when he appeared at court last month . Controversial: Campbell, who has his own neo-Nazi organization, walks into court with a supporter wearing knee-high boots and a swastika arm band . The Nazi-inspired names came to light . after a store refused to decorate a birthday cake reading 'Happy . birthday Adolf Hitler' in December 2008. In 2010, a . New Jersey appeals court ruled there was sufficient evidence of abuse . or neglect due to prior domestic violence to seize the children. Authorities insisted putting the children into care had nothing to do with their names. Court records from previous hearings show that the oldest child, Adolf, frequently threatened to kill people. The . mother reportedly had also once given a note to her neighbor saying she . was terrified of her husband, who had threatened to kill her. Decisions: The Campbells, pictured leaving court in 2009, said they chose the Nazi-themed names as they were unique . The Campbells have previously defended the names, saying they chose them simply because they liked them and they were unique. Campbell said he named his son after the Nazi leader as 'no one else in the world would have that name'. Campbell has since separated from his wife and she has given up rights to her children. A follow-up hearing has been scheduled for later this month.","Heath Campbell, who had four children, said he was a good father outside the New Jersey family court on Monday .

"Margaret Thatcher may have been aware that Alan Clark was having an affair when she appointed him as a minister, newly-released papers reveal. In a previously secret note to Mrs Thatcher, her principal private secretary urges her not to allow ‘this absurd girl’ to prevent the serial womaniser’s appointment.

"Mike Wilcock suffered third-degree burns after a mattress designed to keep patients warm during surgery overheated . As a health-and-safety inspector, Mike Wilcock has a keen eye for detail and an appreciation for proper procedure. But he had no reason to suspect anything untoward when he arrived at hospital for routine keyhole surgery two years ago. 'I wasn't unduly nervous - I'd been told it was just a minor procedure,' says Mike, 58. However, when he came round from the op - to remove a benign cyst from his kidney - at Maidstone Hospital, Mike quickly realised something had gone very wrong during the two hours he was unconscious. 'I immediately noticed a burning pain in my backside. As the anaesthetic wore off the pain got worse. I reached under my hospital gown and could feel blistering and flesh came away in my hand. It felt like my bottom was on fire.' Mike, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, had suffered third-degree burns on his right hip and buttock, caused when a mattress designed to keep patients warm during surgery had overheated. Such devices are commonly used to maintain patients' core body temperature during surgery. A general anaesthetic reduces the body's ability to control its temperature - and if the patient gets too cold, it could affect blood's ability to clot, increasing the risk of bleeding. The quipment used in Mike's surgery works in a similar way to an electric blanket. But what appears to have happened in Mike's case is that a heat sensor which should have monitored his temperature during the operation was placed on a cold saline bag rather than his body. 'Because it registered such a low temperature, the mattress kept heating to the point where it could cook flesh,' he explains. The next 24 hours were a terrifying blur. 'That period is very tough for me to think about. 'The staff first noticed the injury when I complained of pain in the recovery room. Then all hell seemed to break loose with people rushing to look at my backside. 'But all I remember is being given is a bit of ice for the burn and some painkillers. Nothing made much difference to the terrible pain. 'It was only the next day that I was visited by a burns nurse.' A mattress designed to keep patients warm during surgery  overheated leaving Mr Smith with a painful burn (pictured left).  Even two years later (pictured right) the burn is so painful Mr Smith has had to give up sailing . The following day he was admitted to a specialist burns hospital, where doctors said that the burnt area - around 8in by 6in (20cm by 15cm) - was of full thickness, meaning all three layers of skin were damaged. Mike was there for a week, undergoing procedures to remove dead tissue and have an emergency skin graft. But during the skin graft he suffered a heart attack, thought to be down to a combination of three anaesthetics in quick succession, as well as the trauma he'd endured. After Mike's injury, in September 2012, the incident was investigated by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) - where, by coincidence, Mike is head of operations for the South East. The HSE found the staff did not have sufficient training or information to ensure the mattress had been used correctly. Last month, Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust pleaded guilty to a breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act - it is yet to be fined. During the court case it emerged that two other patients had received minor burns in similar circumstances, months before Mike's ordeal. 'If the trust had learnt from these, they could have prevented what happened to me,' says Mike, who has launched his own legal action against the trust. Mistakes in the use of medical devices - which cover a broad spectrum, from high-tech scanners to sticking plasters - cause much needless pain. Latest figures show that in 2013 there were 448 incidents relating to poor use of medical devices reported to the Medical and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Mike's was an extreme case although not a one-off, with seven severe burns from warming devices reported since January 2012. Mr Wilcock underwent procedures to remove dead tissue and had to have an emergency skin graft.  The injury site is pictured three weeks after the grafting . Other injuries caused by high-tech equipment include minor burns in MRI scanners. Staff are meant to ensure patients are not wearing any metal but in these cases, they were wearing nicotine patches, which can contain traces of aluminium. And a patient was injured by an ultrasound probe after staff sterilised it too many times - after a certain number of cleans, the device should have been replaced. A major problem is training, says Peter Walsh, chief executive of the charity Action Against Medical Accidents. 'Technology is constantly advancing and has a valuable and usually positive role to play. But it does mean more risks are introduced, so the system has to be able to deal with that risk. The problems can be avoided with proper training.' In Mike's case, the court heard that staff had failed to read the manual that came with the device, which was introduced to the trust in 2011. Mr Walsh says another issue is that there is inconsistency across the NHS when it comes to makes and models of medical devices used. 'It makes it harder for staff to be familiar with how exactly how each device works,' he says. Two years since his injury, Mike's life has changed dramatically. After the operation, he was unable to work for five months. He is now back at work full time, but has to work two days a week from home and because sitting for long periods is uncomfortable, often has to stand in meetings. Mike, a qualified sailing instructor, also had to give up his hobby of racing dinghies because crouching in boats is too painful. The law firm representing him, Slater & Gordon, says his case is 'extremely worrying'. 'If this had been a much more vulnerable patient, we could have been looking at a significantly different case,' solicitor Laura Craig said. A spokeswoman for Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust has confirmed that the type of device used on Mike is no longer used by the trust following the incident, but could not comment further while the case was still active.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

The shooting was the latest in a string of 'green on blue' attacks in which members of the Afghan security forces have opened fire on international allies. Tragic: The shooting took place at the British HQ in Lashkar Gar in Helmand province . Lieutenant . Gul Nazir is said to have arrived in an army vehicle with several men . pretending to be assigned to guard a delegation of VIPs visiting the . base. But when he was challenged by guards . and told to wait outside, he opened fire with an M16 semi-automatic . rifle, killing the two men and wounding a third.

Calum, Warren and Jake. It is understood that Sgt Taylor worked in intelligence. He had only arrived in Afghanistan four weeks before his death. The Royal Marine’s commanding officer, who cannot be named because of the nature of his work, described him as 'a natural leader with inspirational flair who was devoted to his family'. He added: 'Sgt Luke Taylor was one of those very unique ‘soldiers’ who combined the highest professional standards with a completely disarming and relaxed personality. 'Always an absolute pleasure to work with. You knew that Sgt Taylor would deliver first time, every time.' Another colleague said: 'He had one of those infectious charismas, always able to talk himself out of a situation. For me, like so many, Luke was simply an inspiration.' A joint British-Afghan investigation has been launched to try to discover whether Nazir was working for the Taliban. The renegade soldier was a member of . the Fourth Kandak of 3-215 Brigade and had been a soldier for four . years. The Taliban said he had been in close contact with them. But a . military insider in Whitehall said: ‘The Taliban often over-egg their . involvement for propaganda.’ Their deaths came on the same day a mass suicide attack which was to target buses in the Afghan capital of Kabul was foiled.

"With her long blonde locks, curvaceous figure and elfin features, 40-something Sherry is a woman few men would turn down. But there’s a catch. Sherry isn’t really a woman at all. Instead, she’s a retired property developer from California named Robert. Robert is one of a growing number of men for whom time off means time spent dressed in an elaborate body suit, complete with breasts and a vagina, designed to make them look like the glamorous women they are not. Unlike transgender people, ‘maskers’, or ‘rubber dollers’ as they’re also known, do not feel born in the wrong body. For them, dressing up as a member of the opposite sex is a simply a way to have fun. Scroll down for video . A new Channel 4 documentary, Secrets of the Living Dolls, will reveal the lives of 'maskers' - men dressed in an elaborate body suit designed to make them look like the glamorous women they are not . ‘They’re not freaky people, they’re not weird, they’re just like you and me,’ explains Barbie Ramos, the owner of Femskin, a company that makes the $850 (approximately £518) custom-made silicone outfits worn by maskers. ‘They’re just like what they call “vanilla people” - that’s you and me - except for at night or on special occasions, they like to put on a mask. Why not?’ Her son Adam, who also works at Femskin, adds: ‘I don't think it would be fair to call them gay or even attracted to other men.’ ‘It's about fun. A lot of men have fun by pretending to be women. Not all of them even want to be hot. Some want to be nasty hags.’ Unlike transgender people, 'maskers' do not feel born in the wrong body - it's just their way of having fun . One masker who has no interest in being a nasty hag is Robert, who following a painful divorce, has spent the last 12 years dressing up as Sherry. But while many of the maskers who appear in new Channel 4 documentary, Secrets of the Living Dolls, say it’s all about having fun; for 70-year-old Robert, matters don’t appear quite so simple. 'That's why I do this,’ he breathes as he pouts at his reflection in the bathroom mirror, ‘because I think I look amazing. ‘I just can't believe that's a 70-year-old man in the mirror and that's why I do this,’ he continues. ‘If I saw a 70-year-old man in the mirror I would quit this tomorrow. ‘ . Asked what he sees when he looks at his dolled up reflection, he replies: 'An exciting looking female,’ adding: ‘If I saw a woman like this and she asked me to go hang out, I'd say yeah. ‘ . For him, the appeal of Sherry seems to lie partly in the fact that for him, dating real women has been something of a disappointment. ‘You see, after all, I'm 70-years-old and I've tried dating, and when I'm dating, the women I meet are generally 55 to well up into their 60s,’ he explains. ‘Some of them are in really good shape for their age but they don't look anything like this and it's very difficult to date when you have this to come home to.’ But not every masker has a troubled love life. For Joel, a British bartender who lives with his girlfriend, Mel, dressing up is all about escapism. Robert, finds that the appeal of dressing as Sherry seems to lie partly in the fact that for him, dating real women has been something of a disappointment . Joel, a British bartender who lives with his girlfriend and goes by the female name of 'Jessie' dresses up for escapism . ‘I get enjoyment out of it, I get a sense of escapism out of it,’ he reveals. ‘I'm just out to have fun. It's like the extension of another persona within me that just wants to go out and have fun. ‘The conundrum is people ask: “What do you do when you get dressed up?” And the answer is: not much. ‘Sometimes I just take photos to put up on masking websites, other times it just happens to be who I want to be that day.’ Secrets of the Living Dolls will air tonight at 10pm on Channel 4 . But Joel’s masking career hasn’t always gone smoothly. While girlfriend Mel is happy to accept his alter-ego Jessie, he spent 15 years hiding her from his parents – and from his neighbours. ‘I wouldn't walk 20 steps down the road dressed as a doll because I know general society in the area we live in would be very, very against it,’ he explains. ‘Who knows what could happen?’ One masker who is far less reticent about his hobby is Jon, a Minneapolis father-of-six who works as a forklift driver in a warehouse. According to Jon, not only does masking make him feel good, it also helps him to bond with his daughters. ‘I try to find ways to fit in and be involved with the daughters, and that sometimes means make-up and fingernails and things like that as well,’ he explains. ‘You don't have to have your guard up and necessarily be afraid of other people if you want to dress in a way that makes you feel really good. ‘One guy in particular that I trust at work - he knows that I put on the boobies!’ But not everyone is quite so understanding. Jon’s wife Sunny is his second, met and wed after his first marriage broke up because of his penchant for rubber dolling. ‘This does affect my relationships because I make my priorities and sometimes other people are not happy about my choices,’ he admits. So is it all worth it? Jon’s friend ‘Vanessa’, a 56-year-old who is also father of six, thinks it is. ‘When I'm in my male mode, I go out in public and I just blend in,’ he confesses. ‘When I walk down the street, people don't pay any attention to me. ‘But when I dress up, put this mask on and the wig, it's like being a beautiful woman walking down the street. ‘You become one of the beautiful people and you draw a lot of attention, and attention is not something I've had a lot of.’ Secrets of the Living Dolls, tonight at 10pm on Channel 4 .","Stars of new Channel 4 documentary, Secrets of the Living Dolls .

"Her dark hair piled in a stylish bun atop her head and resplendent in a black and silver salwar kameez, Shaheen Qureshi, from Bradford, looks every inch the glamorous working mother. But while Qureshi might not look unusual, her second marriage was anything but. For, like many thousands more, the mother-of-eight was once a 'co-wife' to a polygamous husband. Yet despite being open to the idea of a second polygamous union, Qureshi admits that her first didn't exactly go to plan. Divorced: Shaheen Qureshi recently divorced her second husband whom she shared with a co-wife . 'I met him at a car wash,' she beams, remembering the day she met the man who would become her second husband. 'I went to clean my car and came back with a husband. Everyone always jokes that I shouldn't be allowed to go to a car wash in case I end up married again!' Then a single mother following the break-up of her first marriage to a Pakistani cousin, Qureshi says she was looking for companionship and a 'stable family life'. What she got was something quite different, with her British Muslim husband spending a total of just six months in her company over their 10-year marriage. 'The second marriage really suited me at first,' she explains. 'I had seven children, some with special needs, and I just wanted to have a husband. Not much time: Shaheen says she didn't get to spend as much time with her husband as she expected to . Commonplace: An estimated 20,000 polygamous families live in the UK, even though it is illegal under UK law . 'We were really similar; there were only six months between us. We had both been married before and we had the same level of thinking. 'I didn't want to be on my own, I wanted support. A part-time marriage really suited me.' And Qureshi is certainly not the only woman to think so, with an estimated 20,000 polygamous marriages estimated to exist in the UK alone - nearly all of which are between Muslims. Worldwide, an estimated five per cent of Muslim marriages are multiple ones, an arrangement endorsed by verse 4:3 of the Qu'ran which states: . 'Marry of the women, who seem good to you, two or three or four; and if ye fear that ye cannot do justice to so many then one only.' Among those to follow its dictates is Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Makoum who has two wives: his first cousin Hind bint Maktoum bin Juma Al Maktoum and Jordan's Princess Haya bint Al Hussein. Famous marriages: Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed (left) has two wives while King Hussein of Jordan had four . Not so glamorous: Despite trying for more than a decade, Shaheen's polygamous marriage was disappointing . Indeed, Princess Haya is herself the child of a polygamous match with her father, the late King Hussein of Jordan, taking no fewer than four wives, among them the British-born Princess Muna al-Hussein. But glamorous though the lives of Princess Haya and the Jordanian consorts are, for Qureshi, struggling to raise a large family in Bradford, the reality was quite different. So too was her relationship with her husband's first wife, which she had hoped would be 'like Sex and the City' but in reality, was plagued by tension and jealousy. 'Initially I didn't have any contact with his first wife,' she explains. 'I think she was fairly upset when she first found out that we had got married.' Not that Qureshi was particularly bothered by that. 'She can't really argue about it as her mother was a second wife,' she adds. 'So if she ever says anything I just say: ""Well why did your father remarry?""' So why did he? According to Qureshi, second, third and even fourth marriages are made for one reason alone - because the man isn't happy with the wife he has. Appearance: Like this Bradford family, Shaheen will appear on Channel 4's The Men With Many Wives tonight . Looking for love: Shaheen says she would like to find another husband - even if he already has a wife . 'Men are polygamous by nature,' she insists. 'That's just life. I'm not a jealous person at all, I have a big heart and I'm willing to give. 'I think the purpose of the second wife is to meet the needs of the husband that perhaps he isn't getting from the first wife. 'Isn't this better than him having an affair and coming back and giving you chlamydia?' Despite Qureshi's desire to make her husband happy, things didn't work out quite as she had hoped with her husband spending at most a couple of hours a week at her home, instead of the three to four days they had originally agreed upon. After a decade of feeling alone, she decided to end the relationship, making the move herself on the grounds that 'it was easier for me to walk away than him'. Now single once again, Qureshi hasn't entirely given up hope of finding love again and says she would even consider another polygamous match should the right one come along. 'I think that a marriage is like a cake,' she explains. 'If you put in rubbish ingredients, it won't be any good but if you put in beautiful ingredients, you will get a beautiful cake.' Key to making Qureshi's 'beautiful cake' is finding sympathetic co-wives who understand the situation and won't get jealous. 'I would like to find a co-wife who is similar to me,' she smiles. 'I hear these stories of these co-wives where there are three or four of them and they are best friends like the Sex and the City girls. 'They share the responsibilities and don't chase one another down, stick in hand. This is what breaks the man down mentally. I just want to be the best wife I can.'","Shaheen Qureshi, from Bradford, is a single mother of eight children .

"The last remaining polar bear at Buenos Aires Zoo has died after overheating in soaring summer temperatures. 'Winner,' who was one of best loved attractions at the zoo, is believed to have been unable to control its body temperature in the extreme heat of the Argentinian summer and died of hyperthermia. The animal, which was covered in heavy fur to cope with freezing conditions in its native Artic habitat, was also believed to have been frightened by the noise from fireworks let off to celebrate Christmas Eve. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: 'Winner' the last polar bear in Buenos Aires Zoo, Argentina, has died from hyperthermia in the soaring summer heat . The zoo is a popular visitor attraction in the Argentine capital and has a tradition of looking after polar bears. The animals used to live in a pool but their cage was improved in 1993 when a 145,000-litre pool was built along with a site for birthing and three security rings. The zoo said in a statement that it had been visited by experts and met all international regulations to house polar bears. Heat: 'Winner' was a popular attraction for visitors to the Zoo (seen here swimming in his pool) Environment: Designed to survive in the Artic - polar bears do not cope well in very hot conditions . The polar bear is often regarded as a marine mammal because of the large amount of time it spends at sea. Its preferred habitat is the annual sea ice covering the waters over the continental shelf in the Artic. The animal is a very good swimmer with some spotted in the sea as far as 200 miles from land. Hardy: Polar bears often spend as much time in the sea as they do on land as they hunt for prey . Polar bears cannot simply acclimatise to hot climates. Even if a polar bear is born in a warm climate and lives there all of his life, he will still possess several physiological adaptations to life in the Arctic. Even if he loses some fur and blubber, he will always have black skin that absorbs heat and hollow hairs which work as efficient solar collectors. Polar bears do not have any physical means of staying cool; they rely on behaviour to do that. They will try to take as much shade as possible during the warmest parts of the day and cool off in cold water when they overheat. Zookeepers may try and balance their energy expenditure and food intake to regulate their body temperature and may be fed a vegetarian diet or simply very little during warmer times (eating meat and fat generates immediate heat energy). The bottom line is that polar bears can be resilient but this does not mean that they are comfortable. Polar bears are found in the Arctic Circle and on neighbouring land masses as far south as Newfoundland Island in Canada. Some sightings have even been reported in the far north of Norway. The bears are rarer in the extreme north of the Arctic although the animal is believed to roam across right across the region. They tend to favour hunting on sea ice and in the sea in search of prey such as seals. Polar bears often frequent areas where . sea ice meets water - primarily around the edges of the ice pack, where . more seals can be found. The global polar bear population is believed to be between 20,000 and 25,000 with 19 recognized sub-populations. The polar bear is the largest terrestrial carnivore, with adult males weighing between 350 and 680 kg (770–1500 lbs) and measuring between 7.9 and 9.8 ft in length.","'Winner' died of hyperthermia at Buenos Aires Zoo after overheating in high summer temperatures .

"Alison White of West Yorkshire has lipoedema . For nearly as long as she can remember, Alison White has had big legs in comparison with the rest of her body. 'I've always had a flat stomach and a small chest, and I'm slim enough that you can see my hip bones sticking out a bit,' says the 32-year-old director of a market research company, who lives in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. 'But even though my waist is no bigger than 30 in, each of my thighs is about the same, and my calves are 18 in. 'My legs are like tree trunks all the way down to my ankles, then I have a ring where it always looks as if I've been wearing tight socks.' Alison had assumed she was 'just a fatty' and when she hit her teens, she started to pay more attention to what she ate. 'I got into the habit of not eating much at all - just an apple and a bit of cheese and bread now and then. 'I got down to a size ten on top, but had legs that looked as if they should belong to a much bigger person.' To disguise this, she wore trousers rather than skirts and over the years continued to diet, trying everything from Atkins and Weight Watchers to meal replacement drinks, but nothing shifted the fat on her lower limbs. 'In 2010, I basically didn't eat for two months,' says Alison, who lives with her boyfriend James, who runs a business making corsets. 'I tracked my measurements at various points on my legs during the process, and though I dropped more than two stone overall - going from 13 st to 10 st 8lb and losing five inches from my waist - my legs stayed the same size.' Finally, in April, she had a lightbulb moment when her boyfriend came across an internet article on a condition called lipoedema. 'James said: ""I think this is you."" I told him to stop being cheeky - my legs weren't nearly as big as those of the girl's in the picture. 'But when I read it, I realised he might be right. And I was relieved to discover I had an actual medical condition and that I wasn't the only one.' Lipoedema is an abnormal distribution of fat that mainly causes the legs - and sometimes also the arms - to gradually become enlarged, says Dirk Pilat, a GP in Tower Hamlets, London, and medical consultant to the charity Lipoedema UK. Both legs tend to be enlarged at the same time and to the same extent. Those with the condition have an excess number of fat cells in affected areas, as well as a build-up of fluid in those cells. Scroll down for video . The affected areas tend to feel softer and more doughy than normal fat, and may be tender to the touch, feel painful and bruise easily - as Alison can confirm. 'A wide variety of numbers are quoted as to how many people are affected - some studies say as many as 11 per cent of all women have it,' says Dr Pilat. It is not clear what causes it, though it does run in families - 'though only on the female side,' he adds. The condition which involves an abnormal build-up of fat cells in the thighs, buttocks and legs . Alison's mother's legs are slim, but she has female cousins with legs similar to hers, always referred to affectionately within her family by their cousins' surname as 'McKelvie legs'. Dr Pilat says: 'It usually manifests itself after puberty or pregnancy, probably for hormonal reasons. Typically, a young girl will go to the gym or a PE class and notice her legs are bigger than those of her peers, especially if she is slim elsewhere. 'That may be what causes her to see her doctor.' A survey of 250 sufferers by Lipoedema UK found that only 5 per cent had the condition diagnosed by their GP, and though most had experienced symptoms since their teens, the average age of diagnosis was 44. Many patients claim they are simply told they are overweight - often prompting a cycle of weight loss that fails to budge the fat on their legs. This is because weight loss cannot reduce the number of fat cells. The condition is often confused with lymphoedema, a more widely recognised condition in which disruption to the lymphatic system - which drains excess fluid from the body - causes swelling in the arms and legs. One key difference is that lipoedema patients typically have an 'ankle bracelet' effect, where excess fat stops just before the feet. Doctors are unsure why the fat is distributed in this way. Constantinos Kyriakides, a consultant vascular surgeon at Barts Health NHS Trust, says: 'There are no definitive tests for lipoedema, so it's diagnosis by exclusion. 'We would typically exclude lymphoedema by doing a clinical examination and a lymphoscintigram - a test that involves injecting a radioactive tracer into the lymphatic system to see how well it moves.' The difficulty is that some lipoedema patients develop an element of lymphodema, too, known as lipo-lymphoedema. 'The pressure of the fat tissue can obstruct the lymphatics, so you end up with a combination of the two,' says Mr Kyriakides. Both conditions are treated and managed in a similar way. Lymphatic drainage massage involves a physiotherapist manually squeezing fluid out of the fat cells and into the blood vessels. It's not a cure, but something to be done at regular intervals. Patients can also wear compression hosiery that helps to reduce the amount of fluid in fat cells. Low-impact exercise, such as swimming, may help to stimulate the movement of fluid and doesn't put too much pressure on the joints. Patients claim they are told they are overweight . Lipoedema patients may experience joint pain, particularly in the knees, perhaps due to the extra leg weight they are carrying. Those affected may want a more permanent cure. However, Mr Kyriakides cautions against opting for surgical treatments such as liposuction. 'With standard liposuction you put big cannulas - tubes that allow fluid to be removed - into the deeper tissues and suck out a lot of fat. But this can damage lymphatic drainage from the leg, which can trigger lymphoedema.' There is evidence that another type of liposuction - tumescent liposuction - can be effective and spare the lymphatic channels. This involves pumping in a liquid solution that provides local anaesthetic and creates a 'buffer' separating the superficial layer of fat from the deeper tissues, where the lymphatic channels are, says Mr Kyriakides. 'You then suck out the fat cells with micro cannulas. It's easier to do on the upper leg, where there is more loose tissue. 'But while I can understand the principle of tumescent liposuction, those who get this treatment aren't necessarily made aware that they should continue to have lymphatic drainage massage or compression. All liposuction does is remove some fat cells - it doesn't stop the other fat cells in the area storing more fluid, so the problem may return.' At one point, Alison, who is actively involved with Lipoedema UK, considered paying to have standard liposuction, until she learnt of the risks. She is concerned that patients are not receiving the correct information about what does and doesn't work, and that effective surgical measures are not available on the NHS. 'Our charity knows of only one surgeon who does the right sort of liposuction - and he is based in Germany.' Yet when it comes to lipoedema, British conservatism in treating it may be a good thing, says Pia Ostergaard, a lecturer in human genetics at St George's University, London, who is doing research into lymphoedema. 'There may be places that are willing to offer treatments. But if you don't have the biological understanding to back it up, you might make it worse. As we don't yet know the underlying cause, it's difficult to progress to knowing how best to treat it.' When Alison went to her GP, he had never heard of lipoedema. 'I asked to be referred to a lymphoedema centre six months ago, but have still heard nothing,' she says. 'I ended up going to New York last month to get an official diagnosis from a specialist, who finally confirmed that I have the condition.' It means Alison, who also has an element of the condition in her upper arms, hasn't yet had any form of treatment. Meanwhile, Lipoedema UK, with the Royal College of GPs, has launched an online course to raise awareness of the condition among family doctors. 'Some people don't realise they have it until their 70s - having spent their whole lives being fobbed off with being told they need to diet more and do more exercise,' says Alison. 'This needs to stop.' lipoedema.co.uk .","Alison White, 32,  has big legs in comparison with the rest of her body .

"Doctors have warned that the new 111 phone number for non-emergency services has led to up to three times more ambulance call-outs and could lower the standard of care that children receive. The Department Of Health has laid down an April 2013 deadline for introducing the 111 helpline, which will replace NHS Direct as the first port of call for patients with urgent, but not life-threatening, symptoms. But the British Medical Association's conference of GPs last week urged the Government to delay implementing the number due to 'serious concerns about the design and precipitous introduction of the 111 model'. Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in a pilot 111 call centre. Doctors have warned that the new helpline has led to up to three times more ambulance call-outs . And private sector operators have threatened to boycott the bidding process because of concerns about cost and the practicality of the plans. Care UK, Capita and Serco have withdrawn from the tender process, leaving Harmoni and publically-owned ambulance trusts as the only potential bidders. Capita cited a lack of organisation as its reason, saying the 111 line had not been 'constructed in a manner that will result in cost effective services'. NHS Direct employs 3,000 staff, of which 40 per cent are trained nurses. But the 111 number will be staffed by call centre handlers with just six weeks' training. The BMA claims this will lead to more referrals and will prove a particularly risky enterprise for vulnerable patients. Dr Laurence Buckman, chairman of the BMA's GP committee said: 'A potentially dangerous version of NHS 111 is set to burst forth upon an unsuspecting public from April . 'Patients may end up being sent to the wrong place, waiting longer, blocking A&E and using ambulances needlessly, when a little more consideration might make it all work properly.' Critics claim the 111 number leads to ambulances being sent out unnecessarily . Mary McCarthy, a GP from Shropshire who is part of a doctors' co-operative Shropdoc, said the pilot schemes showed that ambulance dispatch rates are now three times as high in these four areas. 'That's treble the costs,' she told The Guardian. 'Also, we see evidence of poorer care to children.' In February, the BMA wrote to the Government saying the deadline for introducing the 111 number needs to be relaxed from its current date of April 2013. In a letter to Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, the BMA said doctors had raised a 'number of serious problems and concerns' in the pilot schemes used to test the new number. They included concerns over the level of medical training staff will have in the new service, and whether they will be able to direct patients to the right help. Doctors said they have not had enough time to get involved in the project, and are concerned 'patients will actually receive lower quality care'. The 111 number is currently being piloted in County Durham and Darlington, Luton and the East Midlands. In January, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) warned that up to 300 frontline staff at NHS Direct could lose their jobs under new shift arrangements as the new 111 number is phased in. Workers who are unable to join the new shift pattern will lose their jobs, including those with flexible working arrangements already in place, such as those caring for children, it said. NHS Direct denied the claims, saying 79 per cent of frontline staff had been offered 'one of their preferred roster patterns' and there were enough spaces for everyone to be allocated to a new roster. NHS Direct is not the only organisation tendering to deliver NHS 111 services. The new system could allow private and GP out-of-hours providers and the ambulance service, among others, to deliver the service.","New 111 phone number will be first port of call for patients with urgent, not life-threatening, symptoms .

Destruction: A New York house reduced to ruins by the devastating force of Hurricane Sandy . Traffic is backed up on 10th Avenue: The city will take weeks to recover from the widespread damage . Hundreds of residents of downtown Manhattan are still living in shelters after Sandy left their buildings uninhabitable. One shelter is allowing people to power up their phones to make calls to let friends and family members know how they are doing, although many are still unable to get a signal. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the city will send bottled water and ready-to-eat meals into the hardest-hit neighborhoods throughout the weekend, but some New Yorkers, dispirited after days without power, water and heat, decided to get out. 'It's dirty, and it's getting a little crazy down there,' said Michael Tomeo, who boarded a bus to Philadelphia with his four-year-old son. 'It just feels like you wouldn't want to be out at night.

"An Indiana couple who nursed an injured fawn back to health more than two years ago is now facing jail time after refusing to leave the animal to die. Connersville police officer Jeff Counceller says that it was a little more than two years ago while on patrol that he discovered the tiny deer curled up on a neighbor’s front porch, badly wounded and unable to stand. Without time to help it himself, he called his wife, a registered nurse, who cautiously approached the deer with their teenaged daughter before experiencing the fawn gently licking their hands. Unbeknownst to them at the time, however, was that bringing the animal home with them was illegal according to the state's Department of Natural Resources, with the crime punishable by jail. Punishing: An Indiana couple are facing criminal charges after they nursed this fawn back to health after finding it badly wounded near their home . Good intentions: Jeff and Jennifer Counceller, pictured, brought the deer home, naming it Little Orphan Dani, in hopes of one day releasing it back into the wild . 'I could feel all of the open wounds all along her back side and she wouldn't stand up,' Jennifer Counceller told ABC News of that day back in 2010. She described the deer as having puncture wounds along its hips from a possible coyote attack. The wounds she said were maggot infested. If they left the animal there it would surely die, she reasoned. That was the exact suggestion the DNR offered them when they were contacted. The DNR told them to take the animal out into the woods and leave it there, allowing nature to take its course . 'She would have laid there and starved to death and had a miserable death,' Mrs Connersville told the IndyStar. Repercussions: The couple are accused of illegally possessing a white-tailed deer, a misdemeanor offense punishable with up to 60 days in jail and a fine up to $500 . Instead they took the animal back to their 17-acre farm and began caring for her, starting with a small bottle of goats milk, while giving her the name of Little Orphan Dani. Today the DNR say what they did two years ago was illegal with it being a misdemeanour offense to possess a . white-tailed deer. It's a crime that faces the family with a maximum of 60 days in jail and a . fine up to $500. The Councellers say the newly pressed charge comes after a six-month investigation by the department which included a half a dozen visits to their home and calls to local authorities. The family says they didn’t know at the time that it was illegal to keep the deer. When this was informed, the solution offered to them was to euthanize it with the deer said to be posing a safety threat to humans. ‘I was devastated,’ Mrs Counceller told ABC of her reaction. ‘I spent a year and several months nursing her into adulthood, getting to the point where she was able to go out on her own. Human threat: The Indiana Department of Natural Resources told them, Jeff Counceller pictured, that they have to euthanize the deer with it now being a potential threat to human health . ‘No matter what the law is, we did what was right for the animal,’ she said, adding that they planned to release the animal back into the woods once it was fully recovered. On the day of Dani’s scheduled execution, however, they found the deer gone. The door to her outdoor enclosure was found hanging open. An incident report filed by the DNR lists Jennifer Counceller’s 80-year-old father as a suspect in the animal’s release, according to the IndyStar, but that’s an allegation Mrs Counceller says they cannot prove. The family says they didn't have a hand in Dani's escape but admit that they also didn't try too hard to find out how it happened. Mr Counceller only reasons that Dani had a good number of friends: 'She was very popular.' Not backing down: Mr Counceller, a police officer, and his wife Jennifer, a nurse, plan to fight the charge against them just because of principal while the deer has since been freed into the wild . Deer or no deer, with the ongoing criminal charge the family says they plan to fight their alleged crime, even though court fees could reach $5,000, ten-times more than the threatened fine. ‘Sometimes, it's not always about the DNR laws,’ Mrs Counceller said. ‘Sometimes it's about common sense and what's right in God's eyes. And that's what I'm going to stand for.’ They also reason jail being an unlikely ending for them if found guilty. Among national reaction to the Councellers' charges, a Facebook page has since been set up in support of the family – currently seeing more than 9,500 likes – as well as a petition to drop the charges on change.org. The petition reports a little more than 6,700 signatures as of Tuesday morning but short by roughly 700 claimed needed. The case could go to court next month for a jury trial.","Jeff and Jennifer Counceller accused of illegally harboring the fawn they named Little Orphan Dani .

"Lobbyist Sir Alan Parker has been trying to influence the decision to allow the hostile takeover of AstraZeneca by US giant Pfizer . A lobbyist friend of David Cameron is at the heart of the hostile bid by American drugs giant Pfizer to take over British rival AstraZeneca, it emerged yesterday. Sir Alan Parker, who once holidayed with Mr Cameron and received a knighthood in the New Year honours list, is spearheading the UK lobbying operation for Pfizer’s controversial £63 billion bid. Mr Cameron has been accused of ‘cheerleading’ for the bid, despite concerns about the impact on British jobs and science. Last night Downing Street said it was ‘nonsense’ to suggest the Prime Minister’s friendship with Sir Alan had coloured his view of the proposed deal. ‘The Prime Minister is fighting for British jobs and British science,’ the spokesman said. But the revelations will raise fresh concerns about the influence of well-connected lobbyists within government. Sir Alan, whose PR and lobbying firm Brunswick is acting for Pfizer, has close personal links with Mr Cameron. The Prime Minister was guest of honour at his 50th birthday and the two men’s families have been on holiday together. Sir Alan accompanied Mr Cameron on a trade mission to China in December last year and he was knighted a few weeks later. Tory sources pointed out that Sir Alan, whose firm acted for US food giant Kraft in its bitter 2009 take-over of British chocolate maker  Cadbury, also had close links to Gordon Brown. Brunswick declined to comment. The revelations came amid mounting concern about the potential impact of a foreign buyout of AstraZeneca. The Wellcome Trust, Britain’s biggest medical research foundation, became the latest high-profile organisation to warn that the deal could damage Britain’s science and research base. Sir Alan is a personal friend of British Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured . In a leaked letter to George Osborne, trust chairman Sir William Castell said the deal raised ‘major concerns’. He said AstraZeneca was ‘critical’ to the UK’s science base and he raised doubts about Pfizer’s record. ‘Pfizer’s past acquisitions of major pharmaceutical companies have led to a substantial reduction in research and development activity, which we are concerned could be replicated in this instance,’ Sir William said. Mr Cameron, who has held talks with both sides in the deal, has already extracted a series of assurances from Pfizer about future investment in the UK. But last week he said he wanted further assurances, and officials are examining how to make any promises binding. Nick Clegg yesterday warned that the Government’s massive spending on pharmaceuticals and science gave it a ‘stake’ in the outcome of the deal which justified interference – including demanding assurances on jobs and research. Swedish premier Fredrik Reinfeldt yesterday said Pfizer’s promises could not be trusted. Sweden was given assurances by the  US firm during its 2002 acquisition of Pharmacia but Mr Reinfeldt said:  ‘There were promises that it would mean jobs and operations in Sweden that we don’t think were honoured.’ Ed Miliband was accused of ‘a huge error of judgment’ yesterday after it emerged he had rejected talks with Pfizer about its planned takeover of AstraZeneca. Labour sources confirmed that Mr Miliband had turned down a meeting with Pfizer boss Ian Read because he was ‘too busy’ – just days before he attacked the deal. Labour leader Ed Miliband was heavily criticised for refusing to meet Pfizer boss Ian Read because he was 'too busy' The Labour leader was also facing the prospect of a Commons sleaze inquiry over a donation of £4,400 from former Labour minister Shriti Vadera when she was a board member of AstraZeneca last year. Mr Miliband failed to draw attention to it, as required by parliamentary rules, when he criticised the Pfizer deal in the Commons. Leading Conservatives yesterday accused Mr Miliband of ‘posturing’ and said it was extraordinary that  he chose to hit the election trail rather than discuss the potential fallout of the biggest takeover in British corporate history. David Cameron, who has held talks with both sides in the deal, said his policy of engagement stood in ‘stark contrast to the Labour leader who wouldn’t even meet with them’. Chancellor George Osborne added: ‘It is a huge error of judgment.’","US drugs giant has made a £60billion+ bid for UK's AstraZeneca .

"Bill Gates vacations exactly like you would imagine the richest man in the world should. First up a relaxing game of tennis in the morning before being helicoptered - not ferried - back to the superyacht you and your family have chartered to the tune of $5 million-a-week. Then, an exuberant jet ski around the $330 million boat with wife Melinda and children Rory, Jennifer and Phoebe, moored off the billionaires playground of Porto Cervo, Sardinia. The Microsoft founder and philanthropist - worth $76 billion - has taken time away from his busy schedule to relax with his family - renting The Serene, the 436ft yacht of Stolichnaya vodka magnate, Yuri Scheffler, as a luxurious base. Scroll down for video . Style: Bill Gates returns to The Serene, the $330 million yacht he has chartered for $5 million-a-week. Currently moored off the coast of Sardinia, Italy . Boating: The helicopter carrying Bill Gates approaches to land on The Serene -the world's 9th largest yacht - this week during the billionaire software pioneers vacation . Tough start: Bill Gates serves in his tennis match in Sardinia as he works up a sweat in the morning as he vacations with his family . Return: Keeping fit allows the 58-year-old to travel the world for his philanthropic ventures - such as working to rid the world of malaria . Smiles: The billionaire, who has a fortune of $76 billion and is the richest man in the world, seemed to enjoy his tennis match in Sardinia . Deft control: Bill Gates was playing to win during his tennis game in Sardinia this week . Beaming as he played his shots during his tennis game, Bill obviously had no need for a more traditional boat to get back to the huge yacht his family is aboard. Walking with his entourage from the courts to his aerial transport, Bill was flown back to his yacht, christened The Serene, where he changed into a wet suit for a jet ski with his entire family. Boasting not one, but two helicopter landing bads, because, let's face it one is never enough, The Serene can play host to 24 guests in 12 staterooms, which includes a master suite, one VIP stateroom, seven double cabins and three twin cabins. See more of The Serene . Stroll away: The billionaire walks away from the tennis courts at the billionaires playground of Porto Cervo, which became a resort when the Aga Khan purchased land along the Sardinian coast in the 1960s . Just bring your racket: Bill didn't need to bring much with him for his tennis match seeing as it was only a short hop from his yacht to court - via a helicopter . Your ride: Bill Gates gets ready to get inside his helicopter that will take him back to his rented yacht. In the past he has said that he does have guilty pleasure purchases - such as his own private plane . Can you take me to my yacht? The richest man in the world would have no problems finding a landing spot on his rented yacht - it has two helipads . Get comfortable: The billionaire prepares to sit down to be helicoptered back to the 436ft long yacht. When asked to reveal a secret about himself which no-one would expect, Gates said: 'Playing Bridge is a pretty old-fashioned thing in a way that I really like. 'I do the dishes every night - other people volunteer but I like the way I do it.' Ready to go: Bill Gates prepares for take-off to be returned to his $5million a week yacht moored of Porto Cervo in Sardinia. In an interview earlier this year, Gates said he oesn't plan to stay at the office for days at a time as he did in his younger days when he had 'energy and naivete' on his side . Approach: This wider shot shows the green-grassed landing pad that the Microsoft billionaire's helicopter waited for him on. Gates held the title of 'richest man in the world' for 15 out of the past 20 years, but he was succeeded- briefly- by Mexican telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim Helu for the past four years . Luxury: While most would settle for a boat to take them back to their yacht, Bill Gates decided to go large . With 52 crew, The Serene also boasts a hanger for the helicopter, a seawater swimming pool, submarine hanger, a cinema and onboard WiFi. The Serene was built in 2011 for the owner of Stolichnaya vodka, Yuri Scheffler. She is 436ft long and comes complete with a sundeck that has a wet bar, a wood fire pizza oven and a Teppenyaki grill. She is capable of traveling 6,000 nautical miles on one tank of fuel, which is the same as traveling from London to New York and at least half way back again. Her most impressive feature are her two helipads, but the luuxrious yacht does not shirk on features. She also has an indoor climbing wall and a dedicated children's playroom to keep infants occupied. She also has a fully equipped spa and club and three external swimming pools and one indoors. Boasting an underwater viewing room, The Serene also has space or a large submarine able to reach a depth of more than 330 ft. The opulent yacht also has a gym, swimming pool and two jacuzzis on deck. The Serene also has a full library, health spa, underwater viewing room, nightclub and indoor climbing wall for the Microsoft billionaire and family to enjoy. It has a cruising speed of 15 knots and is able to travel 6000 nautical miles on a full tank - which is almost the distance from London to New York and back again. Indeed, the Gates family have been vacationing off the coast of Porto Cervo for years. Every August the coastal town off the coast of Sardinia becomes a literal billionaires playground. Originally owned by the Aga Khan, who bought up 50km of coastline almost as a private beach in the 1960s, Porto Cervo is now undergoing a mini-boom since he sold it to a consortium of bankers in the early part of the 21st century, . It is where Princess Diana spent her final days before her fated trip to Paris. Former . Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and ex-British prime minister . Tony Blair have spent time relaxing in the sun there. Now dotted with Louis Vuitton and Gucci stores, the coastline is the perfect spot for the richest man in the world to unwind. However, . they may be the children of the world's richest man, but Rory, Jennifer . and Phoebe probably should enjoy this vacation while they can - because . their father is not leaving them any of his $76 billion fortune.

Family fun: Bill Gates and wife Melinda prepare to jump in the coast of Porto Cervo . Rested: Melinda Gates walks the decks of The Serene later that day while her husband prepares to head out again for a jet-ski . In a rare insight into his personal life in March, the Microsoft founder and his wife, Melinda, opened up about how they are raising their family. The . couple, speaking at a TED conference in Vancouver, said their children . will be encouraged to make their own way in the world without the help . of billion-dollar trust funds. Gates . said that instead of money, they had given their two daughters and son a . good education so they can learn how to rely on their own abilities . rather than their parents' fortune. 'You’ve . easily got enough money despite your vast contributions to the . foundation to make them all billionaires,' conference organizer Chris . Anderson said. Luxury: The Serene has the ability for two helicopters to land on deck - the circular pool seen in the middle of the boat can be transformed into a helipad . Opulence: The state room of The Serene is capable of hosting huge parties and guests of billionaires . Super: The Serene cost $330million and boasts space for 24 guests and 53 crew and was delivered to its owner, Stolichnaya tycoon, Yuri Scheffler in 2011 . But, according to Wired, Gates responded by saying: 'They won’t have anything like that. They need to have a sense that their own work is meaningful and important.' 'You’ve got to make sure they have a sense of their own ability and what they’re going to go and do,' he added. Anderson . likened raising three children in the world's richest family 'to a . social experiment without much prior art' before asking the couple, who . run the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, how they had decided to raise . their family. 'We . want to strike a balance so they have the freedom to do anything but . not sort of a lot of money showered on them so that they can go out and . do nothing,' Gates said. He . added that they have told their children most of the fortune would be . left to their charity, which tackles poor health and poverty. Beach day: Microsoft founder Bill Gates later made his way to a beach near Porto Cervo, Sardinia, with his wife, Melinda.

"These are the horrific injuries a great-grandmother suffered when she fell on a street after being dazzled by new patterns in the pavement. Anne Heenan, 74, was walking along New Street in the centre of Grimsby when she slipped on the kerb, which she failed to spot because the colour scheme leaves it 'virtually invisible'. Mrs Heenan, a retired factory worker from Waltham, Lincolnshire, suffered a broken nose, twisted ankle ligaments and a severely bruised face as a result and is scared of going back into the town. Scroll down for video . New design: Anne Heenan, 74, was walking along New Street in Grimsby when she slipped on the kerb. She says she failed to spot the gap because of the new colour scheme . Terrified: The great-grandmother from Waltham, Lincolnshire, is now scared to go back into the town . The street has recently re-opened as a shared space, where the pavement and the road both have the same block-paved surface. But North East Lincolnshire Council is now facing calls to review the revamp because of safety concerns. Mrs Heenan, whose face is still badly bruised three weeks after the ordeal, believes the lack of visual distinction between the two is dangerous and needs to be addressed. She said: 'I think it’s terrible. It is dangerous because you can’t differentiate between the road and the pavement. I think they should do something, paint a white line, anything.' More than 50 people have signed an . online petition urging the council to make the drop from the pavement to . the road more visible. Slip: Mrs Heenan suffered a broken nose and horrific facial injuries as a result of the fall . Pattern: The street has recently re-opened as a shared space, where the pavement and the road both have the same patterned surface . But . the council says that although some pedestrians are having difficulty . identifying the kerb, the new arrangement is satisfactory . overall. Mrs Heenan has sent a letter of complaint to North East Lincolnshire Council about the incident, but says she has yet to receive a reply. She was walking with her daughter and her partner, who had travelled over from America, when she suffered the fall. It was the second time she has walked in the area since the new pavement was unveiled, having previously been down it with a friend, but crucially this time she was on the outside of the pavement. Fears: Mrs Heenan, pictured with her dog Rambo, also twisted a ligament when she lost her footing . Old layout: Pedestrians could differentiate between the road and the pavement before the changes . Aggrieved: The grandmother, who was walking with her daughter at the time, sent a letter of complaint to North East Lincolnshire Council . ‘My foot went down the side, I banged . my head and broke my nose. 'My daughter and her partner picked me up and a . gentleman from the solicitors nearby took me into his office and sat me . down,’ she added. An . ambulance was called and Mrs Heenan was checked over by paramedics. She went . to accident and emergency at Grimsby’s Diana, Princess Of Wales Hospital . the next day. Since the fall, Mrs Heenan has avoided walking in the town centre on her own. She added: ‘The doctor said I had broken my nose and that I was lucky because it was straight and it wouldn’t need surgery. ‘I had twisted my right foot and pulled a ligament. It’s not too bad now but it was very, very painful. ‘I’m all right now, but I’m still very nervous about walking on the pavements in the town centre. ‘If I go with my friend I’m all right but I have not been up on my own since - I really don’t like going into town.’ A spokesperson for North East Lincolnshire Council said: ‘We can confirm we have received Mrs Heenan’s complaint. 'It will be addressed through the usual channels and she will be informed of the outcome.’ East Midlands Ambulance Service said that there had been no significant increase in call-outs to injuries caused by falls in the town centre since the new paving had been installed. However, in January, local authorities in Grimsby were warned that 'hypnotic' patterns on Freeman Street could give pedestrians epileptic fits and confuse people with dementia. Councillor Steve Beasent, who suffers from . epilepsy, said at the time: 'It is a risk to anyone who suffers with photosensitive . epilepsy. It's not just strobe lights that can trigger seizures; . patterns and shapes can cause it.' A spokesman for North East Lincolnshire Falls Collaborative said the group had 'real areas of concern' about the potential risks in the area. Concerns: Freeman Street, also in Grimsby town centre, has been given a similar makeover - and in January its patterned slabs were branded a risk because of their 'hypnotic pattern' The blocks also came under fire . from businesses, residents and taxi drivers, many of whom have branded them a 'waste of money'. The case is similar to West Derby Street in Liverpool, where three pedestrians received pay-outs because of slips and falls in 2010. Individuals were paid sums of £2,000, £6,000, £12,876 and £14,225, depending on the nature of their injuries. In 2012 authorities in Bolton splashed out £13,500 for an anti-algae treatment after a pavement was causing people to slide in the town centre's historic Churchgate.","Anne Heenan was walking on New Street, Grimsby, when she slipped .

"A lack of exercise is as dangerous as smoking and is directly to blame for one in six deaths in Britain, a report has warned. The UK is now even worse than America for inactivity – with half of women and a third of men moving so little in their daily lives that they are exposing themselves to diseases ever earlier in life. Officials from Public Health England warned that our sedentary lifestyles are not only causing obesity – they are directly responsible for a vast range of illnesses. Scroll down for video . A lack of exercise is as dangerous as smoking and is directly to blame for one in six deaths in Britain . These include muscle and joint complaints, depression, high blood pressure, heart disease, dementia, stroke and type 2 diabetes. Together these cost the economy £17.6billion a year, and threaten to ‘destabilise’ the entire welfare state if current trends continue. The report goes on to state that one in six deaths every year are directly due to inactivity. This is about 84,500 in England and Wales – a very similar number to the number of deaths attributed to smoking. It also states that 63 per cent of adults do not take the recommended amount of exercise of two and a half hours over the course of a week. This compares to 18 per cent in the Netherlands, 28 per cent in Germany, 33 per cent in France and 41 per cent in the US. Figures show our average levels of exercise are a fifth lower than in the 1960s and the worst in the Western world – including the US. In Britain, 63 per cent of adults do not take the recommended amount of exercise of two and a half hours over the course of a week . Experts blame our demanding office jobs, less time being spent on the housework and DIY and a preference for watching television instead of being outdoors. Professor Kevin Fenton, executive director of health and wellbeing at Public Health England, the agency responsible for tackling obesity, said: ‘Physical inactivity is unrecognised as a significant health, social and economic burden on individuals and communities in England. ‘It is a leading contributor to rising levels of many long-term conditions such as obesity, diabetes and dementia. Our modern lifestyles amplify the problem, with even those who are already taking regular physical activity at risk of damaging their health by spending long periods sitting down.’ He added: ‘We need to make physical activity the easy, accessible and natural choice for everyone. If physical activity was a drug we’d be hailing it as a miracle cure. ‘Our living environment and working environment has changed over the past four decades and it’s all dragging us to be inactive.’ Officials from Public Health England warned that our sedentary lifestyles are not only causing obesity – they are directly responsible for a vast range of illnesses . The report showed that women tend to exercise less than men, with a quarter of women and a fifth of men classed as inactive. Officials urged people to make simple changes to their routines such as cycling to the shops, gardening at the weekend or taking the stairs rather than the lift. And this week, the head of the NHS Simon Stevens urged companies to offer staff prizes and vouchers to lose weight and be active. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘A lack of physical activity far transcends any harm done by smoking.’ And Mike Hobday, director of policy at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘Physical inactivity is a serious public health concern. Young and old alike need to move more. ‘We must change this couch potato culture and put physical activity at the heart of our daily routine.’ Public Health Minister Jane Ellison said: ‘Whatever age you are, activity is vital for maintaining good health. Increasing physical activity is a priority right across Government.’","Report says the UK is now even worse than the US for inactivity .

"It has been hailed Scotland's most unhealthy snack, dripping with sugar and covered in fat. And now doctors have warned that eating a deep-fried Mars Bar could help trigger a stroke. They say the 1,200 calorie snack is so fattening that it reduces the supply of blood to the brain. A deep-fried Mars Bar could trigger a stroke within minutes of being consumed, Scottish researchers warn . The researchers, from Glasgow University, gave 24 people the chocolate bars coated in batter. They predicted that the chocolate bar would cause a blockage in an artery leading to the brain - also known as an ischaemic stroke. Just 90 minutes later, they noticed that in men, blood flow to the brain had slowed. William Dunn, who performed scans on volunteers, told the Daily Record: 'We’ve shown that eating a sugar and fat-laden snack can actually affect blood flow to the brain within minutes. 'This reduction in the reactivity of blood vessels in the brain has previously been linked to an increased stroke risk – but the changes we observed were modest.' However the researchers noticed no difference in the blood flow to women's brains. Writing in the Scottish Medical Journal, Mr Dunn and his co-author, Professor Matthew Walters, stroke consultant at Glasgow’s Western Infirmary, said: 'The deep-fried Mars bar has been cited as ""all that is wrong with the high-fat, high-sugar Scottish diet"". 'It is also a snack that the international community strongly associates with Scotland.' The pair investigated the effect on blood flow to the brain after eating either a deep-fried Mars Bar or porridge. Scotland-wide, 22 per cent of fish and chip shops sell the snack, according to a report in The Lancet medical journal. The recipe was devised at the Carron Fish Bar in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, in 1992, when a young boy asked for 'a Mars Bar supper'. Eating a sugar and fat-laden snack can quickly affect blood flow to the brain, raising the risk of a blocked artery . Deep-fried Mars bars have been hailed 'all that is wrong with the high-fat, high-sugar Scottish diet' Ann Straiton, manageress at the time, thought he was joking and threatened to throw him out. When he said he was serious, she battered one and popped it in the fryer. It was served with a portion of chips and went down a treat. Lorraine Watson, the current owner, told the Record she still sells up to 150 bars a week. London restaurant, the Grill On The Square in Leicester Square, also sells deep-fried Mars bars. Chef Daniel Smalley told the Daily Mail: 'The secret to getting it right, is to make sure that the batter (flour, bicarbonate of soda, soda water, salt and a small amount of food colouring) is kept very cold. ‘It needs to be around zero degrees. That’s what makes it so crisp and light.’ The bar should be immersed in the fat for between 60 and 90 seconds in a fryer set to 170c. ‘And, no, we don’t use the same fryer that we use to cook our fish.’ He added: 'If you enjoy chocolate, it’s one of the best things to eat. It’s such a complex taste: all that hot caramel, fudge and melted chocolate. 'And then you’ve got the textures: the crunch of the batter alongside the gooiness of the chocolate and caramel.

"Keira Knightley is one of the most stylish women in the world, so it is of little surprise that the British actress was a little underwhelmed with the fashion choices of some of the tech world's biggest names after recently attending a private screening of her new movie in Silicon Valley. Knightley, who is busy promoting her new film The Imitation Game, was a guest on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Monday, where she recounted a day spent with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Google entrepreneur Sergey Brin at the home of billionaire investor Yuri Milner. Her takeaway from the day? Scroll down for video . Making new friends: Keira Knightley (above with Benedict Cumberbatch) recently described a screening she attended with a group of tech giants in Silicon Valley . Casual threads: The actress said the group, which included Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg (above), seemed to be very fond of hoodies and Crocs . Tech titans: Knightley said guest Sergey Brin (left) was 'definitely wearing Crocs' to the screening, held at the home of billionaire investor Yuri Milner (right) 'They had a lot of hoodies. Hoodies are big in the tech industry, I found. Silicon Valley, they love it. And Crocs,' she told Kimmel. 'Sergey, whom I assume is a very rich man, was definitely wearing Crocs.' Knightley also took some time at the gathering to ask the men when she could expect to see someone finally make a hoverboard, the levitating boards used as a mode of transport in the films Back to the Future Part II and Back to the Future Part III. Sadly, it did not go the way Knightley had hoped. 'None of them were into the idea,' she told Kimmel. Style star: Knightley has long been considered one of the best dressed women in the world, known for her perfect red carpet the looks . One of the men was however interested in seeing Knightley again, and approached her with a line only a tech industry millionaire could pull off. 'Somebody actually came up to me and said, ""Well if you ever want to see a spaceship, here's my card,"" which has never happened to me before,' said the actress. 'So I may phone him and say, ""Yes, show me spaceships.""' Back to the future: Knightley also revealed that she asked the men if they might ever make hoverboards . Awards season: The actress is currently promoting her new film The Imitation Game (above), which is expected to score her and costar Cumberbatch both Oscar nominations . Swank digs: The screening was held at the palatial home of Milner (above) The group was no doubt incredibly eager to see Knightley's new film as it tells the story of Alan Turing, the man who famously broke Nazi codes during World War II and is thought by many to have played the single biggest  role in the Allied victory. As a result, he has long been considered the father of theoretical computer science. He is played by British Lothario Benedict Cumberbatch in the film, while Knightley plays fellow cryptanalyst Joan Clarke. Both actors, and the film, are expected by many to be nominated for Academy Awards.","Keira Knightley attended a private screening of her new film The Imitation Game at the home of billionaire investor Yuri Milner in Silicon Valley .

"It is furniture befitting the most prestigious seat of learning. But a university’s plans to pay £150,000 for a set of seven hand-crafted chairs have left staff in a fury. Plymouth University has commissioned luxury furniture maker John Makepeace to create the three-legged seats for use in graduation ceremonies. They are meant to be seen as symbols of success, although as yet it is unclear exactly who would be sitting on them. The  chairs, which cost a total of £150,000, are to be used during graduation ceremonies (file picture) A senior university source said the total price tag stands at £150,000 – a quarter of the total £600,000 budget for this year’s graduation programme. Nick Varney of the UCU teaching union said the decision was a mistake at a time when staff were being laid off. ‘Splashing out £150,000 on seven chairs really is quite extraordinary,’ he said. ‘It is even more incredible when you consider that financial problems have been given as a reason for job cuts. ‘If the university needs to save money it should look at its travel and expenses bills and cut down on chairs. ‘Anyone who thinks chairs are a symbol of success is more out of touch than we feared and should probably not be running a university. A successful university is one where students receive a quality education from well-supported staff – chairs simply don’t come into it.’ Students condemned the decision, one tweeting: ‘Plymouth University spend £150,000 on seven chairs ... Not professorial “chairs”. Real chairs. To sit on. Mad.’ Deputy vice-chancellor David Coslett said the commissioning process was ongoing and the university planned to pay for the chairs through private donations and charitable foundations. Professor Coslett was warned in a series of emails between senior staff members that it would be damaging to the university’s reputation if the price was made public. But he said in the emails that he was keen to push ahead, saying the chairs would be ‘a symbol of success’. He added: ‘If there is any disquiet, I am more than confident time will judge this to have been a great decision.’ He said the chairs followed the commissioning of ceremonial robes and a mace and the granting of a coat of arms.","The chairs will be used during graduation ceremonies at Plymouth University .

"Allies of Britain’s greatest peacetime prime minister expressed disappointment last night that she will not be given a full state funeral. Baroness Thatcher, the first and only woman voted into Number Ten, died peacefully yesterday at the age of 87 after the latest in a series of strokes. Friends and foes alike described her as the most dominant political figure to emerge in Britain since Sir Winston Churchill – the last commoner to be honoured with a state funeral in 1965. The Iron Lady in waiting: Margaret Thatcher posing in a glamorous grey chiffon dress, London 1974. The attache case for Secretary of State for Education and Science is on the right of the picture . She will next week be given a ‘ceremonial’ funeral with military honours – an equivalent to the ceremonies that marked the passing of Princess Diana and the Queen Mother. Some Conservative MPs said they believed the former prime minister merited the highest honour, though friends said she did not want a state funeral and had disliked the idea of her body lying in state in Westminster Hall. Election elation: Mrs Thatcher waves from the steps of No 10 Downing Street with husband Denis after becoming Britain's first female Prime Minister in 1979 . Elegant: Baroness Thatcher is pictured in 1988 (left) and 1986 (right), during her time as British prime minister . Peter Bone, the MP for . Wellingborough, said: ‘I think she should have the highest kind of . funeral that can be allowed. I would have thought a state funeral would . be very appropriate. 'She was the first female prime minister. She was also the greatest peacetime prime minister we ever had.’ Charlie Elphicke, the MP for Dover, . said: ‘Personally I feel Mrs T should have the full state funeral like . Churchill and Wellington. She was as amazing a Briton as they were.’ But . he later added: ‘I agree her wishes must be respected.’ MAILONLINE AND DAILY MAIL CAMPAIGN: HOW TO MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD . If . you believe Lady Thatcher deserves a state funeral, and want the . Government to know, just sign this online petition or print out the form . below and send it to us. We will pass it to the Prime Minister's office . at 10 Downing Street . Alun Cairns, who represents the Vale . of Glamorgan, concurred with that sentiment but said: ‘Margaret Thatcher . deserves a state funeral after transforming our nation in such a . positive way. The changes were never reversed.’ David . Cameron hailed Lady Thatcher yesterday as ‘the patriot prime minister’, . the Queen expressed her sadness and President Obama said she had shown . ‘our daughters that there is no glass ceiling that can’t be shattered’. Mr . Cameron, who broke off a visit to Europe to return to London, announced . that in an extraordinary move, Parliament is to be recalled from its . Easter break tomorrow to mark her passing. Lady Thatcher died at the Ritz hotel in London, where she had been recuperating after a minor operation. Hotel: Margaret Thatcher had been staying at the Ritz in central London until she died this morning, and police were there today . Her children, Sir Mark and Carol, were not at her bedside as they were abroad. Her doctor and carer were present when she died. Lord . (Charles) Powell, Lady Thatcher’s closest and longest-serving policy . aide, said: ‘I was with her last night. I spent an hour or so with her, . and I am very pleased that I did. I regard it as very private. ‘She . changed us all. We went from being a people who saw ourselves as . eternall y on the downward slide to a nation  proud to be British again. On the world stage too, she made Britain count once more.’ Baroness Thatcher’s body was moved from the Ritz late last night amid a highly visible police presence. Her death at the hotel, where she had been staying since undergoing minor surgery last December, led to a major police security operation. Under top-level plans to preserve the dignity of national figures, uniformed officers sealed off the hotel in Piccadilly. Staff closed the car park to prepare for the arrival of the coroner’s vehicle and black hoarding was placed over gates leading into the building. A helicopter hovered overhead, surveying a route for the car to take. Conservative MP Conor Burns, who . visited Lady Thatcher weekly, said: ‘I can’t help thinking about what . she said about her friend President Reagan, who suffered very badly in . his final years with Alzheimer’s. 'Although she didn’t have Alzheimer’s, her memory and mind was not by any means as sharp as it was. ‘She . said of Reagan in her eulogy for him, “I think today that President . Reagan is fully himself again”. I like to think tonight, Margaret . Thatcher is herself again.’ Mr Burns said he had discussed plans for . her funeral with her several times over recent years and ‘she was . completely and totally uninterested’. Outpouring of grief: Floral tributes are collected and taken inside the home of the late Margaret Thatcher in Chester Square, London following an announcement of her death at the age of 87 . ‘Her comment always about lying in . state was “I’m not Winston”. I think her legacy will stand as that of a . political colossus if she was buried in a cardboard box.’ Lady . Thatcher’s friend and spokesman Lord Bell insisted she had not wanted a . state funeral. The cost of next week’s service, most probably on . Wednesday, will be shared between the state and her estate. Lord . Bell said: ‘The funeral that has been arranged for her is the one that . she asked for. It has been discussed for many years. 'Of course I spent a lot of time with her personally and she absolutely made it clear to me that she thought it would be wholly inappropriate for her body to lie in state. ‘She did not like the idea and she had no doubt there would be some terrible demonstration. She was determined that should not happen and specifically made that request of Downing Street. 'And she didn’t want a fly-past as she thought that was a waste of money – somewhat in character you might think. ‘I would much rather she had a state funeral but if the woman herself said that she didn’t want to have one and we have to understand that.’","Baroness Thatcher died peacefully at the age of 87 after a stroke .

"Tomas Rosicky says he can't explain why he's not playing a more prominent role for Arsenal as his side struggle to find the right combinations this season but he insists his age, 34, is not a factor. Arsene Wenger's Gunners have won just four of their 11 Premier League matches this campaign and have recently blown leads against Anderlecht in their 3-3 Champions League draw and in an equally dramatic 2-1 loss in Swansea.

'The coach is trying to find a system that best suits the players, and vice versa,' Rosicky said in The Times. 'I'm not in this alone - there are other players in a similar boat. When we do get a chance, it's harder for us to get into our rhythm. Arsene Wenger is still trying to decide on his best formation, and as yet Rosicky isn't part of it . 'So far, this season has been disappointing for us. We haven't played well, and when I've played I've not been at the forefront of things.' Although being the oldest player in the Gunners squad, with the closest team-mate to his 34 years being Mikel Arteta at 32, Rosicky insists fitness or age shouldn't have a bearing on Wenger's selections. 'I'm not sure what's going on,' he said. 'I understand that I am 34 years old and that it probably plays a role, whether I like it or not. That's without a doubt. Sanchez's face tells the story as Arsenal concede in their 2-1 loss to Swansea in the Premier League . 'However, I'm not in physical decline.

"Ross Barkley has spoken of his dream of succeeding where hero David Beckham failed by lifting a trophy with England. The Everton midfielder revealed his first memory of international football was watching Beckham fire in the late free-kick against Greece to qualify England for the 2002 World Cup.

But the ultimate ambition is to win a major competition. 'To lift a trophy for England,' he said. 'To win something – because that's what every player wants to do. It would be a dream come true if that happened.' Barkley, who has won nine caps already, maintained he is keeping a level head despite praise from the likes of Barcelona maestro Xavi, who said he could easily grace the Nou Camp in future years. Wayne Rooney, who like Barkley burst onto the scene as a teenager at Everton, has been providing words of advice and encouragement – especially on how to cope with the pressures of high expectation. 'He's been helpful to me and the other youngsters like Raheem (Sterling) and Luke Shaw,' said Barkley. 'He's always been there for a bit of guidance and to pass his experience on to us. He gives some good advice to us. Barkley has praised the influence of captain Wayne Rooney (centre), who is set to win his 100th cap . Barkley, pictured  against Costa Rica at the World Cup, is in his first England squad since the trip to Brazil . 'He's just said he coped with (the pressure) easily, it just came naturally to him. That's the way I look at it, I don't want to get big-headed, I just take it as it comes. 'There are still loads of pictures of Wayne at the Everton Academy, and memorabilia of him when he was at the club. There are clips of him down in the video room. 'When I was younger I saw Wayne breaking through at 16, scoring cracking goals. Then for him to go and make his England debut, while he was still at Everton, was good to see. He's gone on and had a tremendous career and I've always looked up to him. 'I've always had my feet on the ground and I've never forgotten where I come from. It's great be compared to Paul Scholes and the Wayne Rooneys of this world. But I'm just focused on being myself and playing my own game and hopefully getting better. 'I haven't really felt any expectation. I just focus on getting better and doing things right on the pitch. Everything else takes care of itself.'

Barkley admits that winning a trophy with England in the future would be 'a dream come true' Barkley appeared in all three of England's World Cup games in Brazil and was one of the few to leave with his reputation enhanced. 'I found the World Cup experience really good for me,' he added. 'Obviously we didn't do the best. But for me and the other younger lads it was good for us to get a game.

"A couple who once gave birth to another couple's baby after an IVF mix-up have now welcomed a little boy - who was miraculously conceived 'the old fashioned way'. Nicholas Winton Savage was born weighing a healthy 7lb 1oz via cesarean section on Wednesday, bringing Carolyn and Sean Savage's brood to six - despite their battle with fertility for two decades. Baby Nicholas, who was conceived naturally when Carolyn was 45, joins two older brothers, a big sister and a set of twin girls, who were carried by a surrogate and delivered in 2011. The Savages, from Sylvania, Ohio, wrote a book, 'Inconceivable', after the mix-up that saw them give birth to another couple's son  and ultimately hand him over to the biological parents. Scroll down for video . Joy: Carolyn Savage, 45, and husband Sean, 44, welcomed a son, Nicholas, on Wednesday after conceiving him naturally after years of fertility issues. Six years ago, she had another couple's child after an IVF mix-up . Brood: The couple already have two sons, Drew (left) and Ryan (right), daughter Mary Kate (center), who was born after IVF in 2008, and twins Reagan and Isabella, who were born via a surrogate in 2011 . Carolyn learned in 2009 she was carrying Shannon and Paul Morells' child after a fertility clinic accidentally transferred the wrong embryo to her after confusing their names. Mrs Mor . Despite being advised to have an abortion, the Savages refused, and Carolyn served as an unplanned surrogate for the Morells, giving birth to the boy, Logan in September 2009. 'I already felt pregnant,' she wrote. 'I was never going to deny this child life, just because it wasn't mine.' In the book, she detailed the pain of handing over the baby and her conflicting emotions about the biological parents, who she saw as the people who were 'going to take my baby away from me'. The Morells, who have also released their own book called 'Misconception', have two older daughters. Tough decision: In 2009, Carolyn learned she was carrying another couple's baby after a mix-up at a fertility clinic. Going against doctor's recommendations, she carried the boy, Logan (pictured) to full term . Growing up: Logan is pictured in April 2010 with his parents Paul and Shannon Morell. The Savages handed him over to the Morells just minutes after he was born. The couple have two older daughters . As she announced her most recent pregnancy in a post on Today Parents in June, Carolyn spoke of Logan, 'who I loved as my own and still think of and pray for every single day'. In the post, she expressed her shock at learning she was now pregnant the natural way. 'At the age of 45, after two decades without a spontaneous conception; after countless ovarian stimulation cycles, multiple intrauterine inseminations and more than five IVF attempts; after six reproductive endocrinologists threw up their arms, unable to explain why we couldn't conceive; and after one of those doctors accidentally transferred the embryos of another couple into me resulting in a pregnancy that pushed me to the limits of my sanity; I was pregnant — the old fashioned way,' she wrote. 'For me and many other women who suffer from infertility, that is the stuff of fairy tales.' She wrote that she did not have high hopes that the baby would survive but 'finally, at 15 weeks we received the results of our cell free DNA study: Our baby was chromosomally typical, and he is a boy.' Happy family: The Ohio family are pictured together before their latest addition. Only baby Nicholas and the couple's oldest son Drew (pictured left), now 20, were conceived 'sponatenously', Carolyn said . Earlier this week, she explained on her blog, Mama on the Fly: Making my Way With a Half Full Cup, that the baby would be delivered at 37 and a half weeks, due to her creeping blood pressure. 'This little guy is coming a tad earlier than anticipated and although statistically he should be fine, you know we have a history of ending up on the wrong side of statistics,' she said. 'So, could you say a little prayer for our boy?' The proud father announced the pregnancy on the blog on Wednesday evening. 'Thank you for lifting our entire family in your thoughts and prayers over the past nine months,' he wrote as he posted pictures of the happy family. 'Mother and son are doing great. God is good. We are grateful.'","Carolyn and Sean Savage wrote a book, 'Inconceivable', about how a fertility clinic accidentally transferred the embryo of another couple to Carolyn .

"Abu Hamza, pictured, held 12 secret meetings with Special Branch and MI5. He was repeatedly questioned by security officials between 1997 and 2003 . The full extent of Abu Hamza’s contact with British security services was revealed last night. The hook-handed cleric held 12 secret meetings with Special Branch and MI5. He was repeatedly questioned by security officials between 1997 and 2003 – the year before he was finally arrested for inciting murder. The revelations came after it was claimed at his New York terror trial that he acted as an intermediary between MI5 and Islamist fanatics to ‘keep the streets of London safe’. Whitehall officials confirmed the extent of the contact between Hamza and police and security agents, which involved nine meetings in 1997 and 1998 alone. But they downplayed suggestions that a deal had been done to protect Hamza from arrest in return for information on terror plots or help in smoothing community relations. Senior sources suspect Hamza of trying to re-write his past for the court’s  benefit. He could be jailed for life in the US if charges of hostage-taking and  trying to set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon, are proved. Yesterday, Hamza sobbed in the  witness box at Manhattan Federal Court as he addressed two of the most notorious episodes from his past. For years, followers believed he had stood alongside mujahideen fighters in Afghanistan in the 1980s against the occupying Soviets and had lost his arms in a landmine blast. But Hamza claimed that, in fact, his arms were blown off while he was working on a road project in Pakistan in 1993 when he tried to throw a container of explosives away. He later had hooks fitted by the NHS, he said. The fanatic also said that in Afghanistan, he had not been a rebel fighter but a health and safety officer ensuring that trenches did not collapse. ‘I was responsible for health and safety of the mujahideen,’ he said. There was a moment of levity when Hamza told the court that he had obtained a passport with a new name to deliver aid supplies to Muslim forces in Bosnia in 1994 as the situation there was so dangerous for Arabs. ‘It is very simple in Britain,’ he said. ‘You pay £25 and you say you want to be John Travolta and you become John Travolta.’ District Judge Katherine  Forrest then asked: ‘And did you become John Travolta?’ He replied. ‘No, madam.’ Hamza said his only involvement with the Afghan conflict was to ‘fire a few bullets at the Communist regime’. Sobbing on the stand: A sketch of Hamza giving evidence at his trial in New York as he faces US terrorism charges . He added that his ‘reputation is much, much bigger than the reality’. During a sometimes emotional testimony, he banged his stumps on the witness box. He also broke down in tears as he talked about the massacre of Muslims in  Srebrenica in Bosnia in 1995. The judge called a seven-minute break and Hamza, who had a red nose from sobbing, left the court to compose himself. On Wednesday, lawyers for Hamza told of his claim that he had been working with MI5, while running the notorious Finsbury Park mosque in  north London. Hamza had previously claimed – at his 2005/6 trial in Britain for using his sermons to incite murder – that his preaching had been tacitly approved by MI5. He said he had been approached in 1997 by officers from MI5 who had indicated that his speeches did not break the law, but that position had changed in 2000. Hamza told the court: ‘I said, “My sermons, is it a problem?” They said, “Well, it’s freedom of speech, you don’t have to worry as long as we don’t see blood on the streets”. Only in 2000 they said, “We think you are walking on a tightrope”. They said there were some things that they don’t like.’ But just how much contact Hamza had with the security services is only now emerging. Between . 1997 and 1998 there were six meetings between Hamza and an MI5 officer . and, separately, three meetings with Special Branch. He met MI5 and Special Branch again in 2000 and had a final meeting with the police in 2003. Despite the number of meetings, Whitehall sources cast doubt on Hamza’s claims. Muslim cleric, Abu Hamza, pictured here in 2002. Whitehall officials have confirmed the extent of the contact between Hamza and police and security agents, which involved nine meetings in 1997 and 1998 alone . Officials point out that, when trying to overturn his UK convictions in 2006, he had made similar claims to appeal judges. In that case, the court had access to transcripts of the meetings between Hamza and security officials but flatly rejected his argument he had been promised protection from prosecution. The links between Hamza and other fanatics, and the security officials have fuelled speculation of a so-called ‘covenant of security’. The deal allegedly allowed radical clerics to encourage Islamist attacks abroad. In return, it was hoped there would be no attacks on targets in Britain. There have also been claims that police and the security services ‘tolerated’ Hamza because his Mosque became a ‘honeypot’ for Islamist fanatics – allowing officials to keep tabs on those coming and going and put them under surveillance. At least four Al Qaeda-trained terrorists who failed in major plots ‘came under Hamza’s spell’. They were Brixton shoe-bomber Richard Reid, Gloucester grammar school boy and reluctant shoe-bomber Saajid Badat, police killer and ricin poison plotter Kamel Bourgass and the ‘20th’ September 11 hijacker, Zacarias Moussaoui. Hamza denies the 11 kidnapping and terrorism charges he faces in the US, where he was extradited in 2012 after a lengthy battle. The court has yet to decide if documents relating to his meetings with police and MI5 will be admissible.","Full extent of Abu Hamza's contact with British security services revealed .

"Mauro Zarate has refuted claims that he wants to leave West Ham. Speaking to Italian media, agent Luis Ruzzi spoke about Zarate's future and said: 'At West Ham he plays behind the strikers and that is not his position. 'He is a centre-forward and if there is a team out there willing to let him play in his natural role, then we will be very happy to consider it. Mauro Zarate (celebrating with Mark Noble against Southampton) insists he is happy at West Ham . The Argentine's only goal for the Hammers came away at Crystal Palace at the back-end of August . 'Mauro is often used out of position by the current coach (Sam Allardyce) and this is pushing him to seriously consider changing his club. It's true he has a contract until 2017 with the Hammers but I think we can find a solution to suit everyone. 'It's a shame that, apart from his time at Velez, in recent years they make him play out of position. He is a striker, a hitman. At this time you could get Zarate for a much lower price than he is really worth. Anyone who decides to go for him will certainly be getting a bargain.' However, Zarate took to twitter to clarify his situation, saying: 'According to recent news articles I would like to inform that I have no agent and I never said that I wanted to leave West Ham. If that would happen it would be because a joint decision of the club and myself. 'The most important thing is that West Ham will keep progressing. The manager is doing a great job and has my full support! Come on you irons!'

"MI5 has warned large corporations that foreign spy agencies may be secretly recruiting their IT workers in the hope of gathering sensitive information for use in cyber attacks, it has been claimed. The security service is said to have conducted talks with senior figures at a number of leading British businesses in recent months, with the infiltration of IT departments understood to be a top priority. Even the most junior IT worker could compromise vital computer systems by uploading malicious software, and could also gain access to the kind of sensitive information which may prove useful to hostile nations such as Russia, China or Iran. Threat: MI5 has warned that even the most junior IT worker could compromise computer systems on behalf of hostile countries such as Russia, China or Iran . MI5's warnings come in the hope of encouraging big businesses to boost their security systems, according to a report in the Financial Times. Although many British companies have increased their systems to protect against external cyber attacks in recent years, the threat from malicious members of staff has been somewhat ignored. Foreign intelligence agencies are now thought to be taking advantage of this vulnerability by targetting junior IT workers with access to privileged information - such as corporate or national secrets - and paying them large amounts of money to pass on the details. Concern: The threat posed by low-level workers was highlighted by the recent Edward Snowden case . They may also use the members of staff to upload virus' or malware to computer systems in the hope of causing a business serious harm, and possibly even impact on stock markets. Paul Stockton - the former U.S. assistant secretary of defence with responsibility for homeland defence and security - explained to the newspaper how spy agencies would not need to target high level workers to gain lucrative information. 'Insider threats are a growing challenge... the highest risk employees, they're not necessarily those at the highest levels of an organisation,' he said. 'Rather it is the systems administrators and others who hold the keys to the IT kingdom that pose such significant potential threats,' he added. The threat posed by low-level workers was highlighted by the case of Edward Snowden - the former junior security contractor who leaked thousands of classified documents early last year. Snowden's leaked documents uncovered the existence of numerous global surveillance programs, many of them run by his former employer - the U.S. National Security Agency. Snowden's claims his 'sole motive' for leaking the documents was 'to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them.' The controversial disclosures have led to intense debates over mass surveillance, government secrecy, and the balance between national security and information privacy.","Security service warns of the threat posed to firms by members of staff .

"Ask a football fan who the greatest player in the world right now is, and they will more than likely fire back at you one of two names. Since 2008, the official world's greatest player prizes have been a two-horse race between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. But for how long can the duo dominate at the top before a young upstart takes their place? It could be sooner than you think as a certain Neymar is already exceeding the game's dominant duo at international level. Neymar scored twice in Brazil's 4-0 friendly win over Turkey in Istanbul on Wednesday . Neymar skips past a challenge of Turkey's Ismail Koybasi following another impressive performance, with the forward declaring after the match he was in the form of his life . With just 59 caps, Neymar already has 42 goals to his name as he looks to continue his rapid rise . The Barcelona forward scored twice in Brazil's 4-0 win in Turkey on Wednesday, taking his international tally to 42 goals in just 59 international games. To put that into perspective, Messi has just three more goals from 96 Argentina appearances, while Ronaldo's 51 goals have taken him 116 caps. Luis Suarez has also scored 42 international goals - but even he has played 79 times for Uruguay. Lionel Messi (left) and Cristiano Ronaldo's strike rates at international level are no match for Neymar's . Neymar (Brazil): 59 caps, 42 goals . Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal) 116, 51 . Lionel Messi (Argentina) 96, 45 . Luis Suarez (Uruguay) 79, 42 . Didier Drogba (Ivory Coast) 104, 65 . Wayne Rooney (England) 99, 43 . While Messi is still the undisputed No 1 star at Barcelona, Neymar looks to already have the measure of his team-mate on the international stage. It may have been the Argentine picking up the Golden Ball at this summer's World Cup finals, but the 27-year-old faded in the latter stages of the competition - to the point where his impact on matches was becoming minimal. Neymar however was the stand-out star in a Brazil team who were in with a good chance of going all the way on home soil. The host nation had their weaknesses but with Neymar in their ranks they were unbeatable... Until he got injured. Neymar poses for a selfie with Brazil team-mates on the team coach following the win over Turkey .

Total: . 2 caps . 13 caps . 12 caps . 19 caps . 13 caps . 59 caps . 1 goal . 7 goals . 9 goals . 10 goals . 15 goals . 42 goals . Everyone knows what happened next as first Germany (7-1) then Holland (3-0) ripped in to Brazil to expose just how much the 22-year-old was carrying the international team. Even the players knew it judging by the over-the-top reaction of bringing Neymar shirts and caps out before the ill-fated annihilation by Germany in the World Cup semi-final. Just to prove he wasn't riding on the crest of a wave, his return from injury for the team has resulted in five consecutive wins for Brazil - with Neymar scoring all four goals in a 4-0 win in Japan. Brazil capitulated at the World Cup after Neymar injured his back in the quarter-final against Colombia . Such was Neymar's impact on the World Cup, Brazil's squad posed with the forward's shirt on the pitch shortly before being hammered 7-1 by Germany in the teams' World Cup semi-final earlier this summer . Neymar has built on his fine World Cup form, recently scoring all four goals in a 4-0 win over Japan . It's transforming to his club game too. After a steady first season at Barcelona, the forward now looks ready to kick on and take European football by storm. He's one goal ahead of Messi this term with 12 strikes. Neymar only scored 13 for Barca in his first season following his high profile switch from Santos, but he now looks ready to hit the next level having settled in Europe. Ronaldo's 24 goals makes the Portuguese still top dog in Spain, but Neymar's rapid progression cannot be ignored whether it's in a Brazil shirt or a Barcelona one. Following a steady first campaign in Europe, Neymar has kicked on in his second season at Barcelona as he started the year by outscoring Messi across all competitions . After another fine performance against Turkey, where he was applauded off by the home fans, the forward admitted he was in the form of his life but also fired out a warning to his rivals and detractors that he will only get better. 'I think so!' said Neymar. 'I’m very emotional. It’s another country, another stadium to keep in my heart. I didn’t expect this, I couldn’t be happier. But I always want more. I don’t want to remain at this level.' For now the greatest player in the world debate still circles around Messi and Ronaldo, but the future is coming and it may arrive sooner than you think in the shape of Neymar if his international form is anything to go by.","Neymar scored twice in Brazil's 4-0 win over Turkey in Istanbul .

"David Cameron hailed Margaret Thatcher as ‘the patriot Prime Minister’ with a ‘lionhearted love for this country’ last night as he led tributes to the woman hailed as Britain’s greatest peacetime leader. Mr Cameron, speaking on the steps of 10 Downing Street said the country had lost a ‘great leader, a great Prime Minister and a great Briton’. Old colleagues and former foes alike united to acknowledge her position as the most towering political figure since Sir Winston Churchill, a pioneer as the first women prime minister and an international champion of free market economics. Full of praise: Prime Minister David Cameron makes a statement outside 10 Downing Street in central London yesterday, after Baroness Thatcher died at the age of 87 following a stroke . Mr Cameron cut short a trip to Europe to return to London following the news and said Parliament would be recalled from recess tomorrow so politicians could pay tribute. He said: ‘Margaret Thatcher didn’t just lead our country – she saved our country. And we should never forget that the odds were stacked against her. She was the shopkeeper’s daughter from Grantham who made it to the highest office in the land. ‘There were people who said she couldn’t make it; who stood in her way; who said a woman couldn’t lead. She defied them all. ‘She will be remembered for the big political battles she fought. Taking on the union barons. Privatising industry. Unleashing enterprise. Rescuing the economy. Letting people buy their council homes. ‘Winning the Falklands War. Strengthening our defences. Helping to win the Cold War. Margaret Thatcher took a country that was on its knees and made Britain stand tall again.’ Mr Cameron said it could not be denied that Lady Thatcher ‘divided opinion’. ‘But if there is one thing that cuts through all of this – one thing that runs through everything she did – it was her lionhearted love for this country. She was the patriot Prime Minister and she fought for Britain’s interests every single step of the way. ‘Margaret Thatcher loved this country and served it with all she had. The big beasts of Lady Thatcher’s Cabinets joined in paying tribute yesterday. Lord Tebbit, former Tory Party chairman said: ‘It is a sadness that such an immense figure of the late 20th century should have gone – but perhaps a merciful release for her, from a life which must have been increasingly empty in recent years. Closing act: Lady Thatcher and husband Denis leave Number 10 on November 28, 1990 . ‘She did indeed change Britain for the . better – would that there was somebody like her to lead us again now! I . am grateful to her for allowing me to serve her country in that way.’ Sir John Major, . Lady Thatcher’s successor, said: ‘In government, the UK was turned . around under – and in large measure because of – her leadership. Her . reforms of the economy, trades union law, and her recovery of the . Falkland Islands elevated her above normal politics, and may not have . been achieved under any other leader. ‘Her outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with her: courage and determination in politics, and humanity and generosity of spirit in private.’ Lord Heseltine, Cabinet minister and rival, said: ‘I am sorry to learn of Lady Thatcher’s death. The illness of her last years has been cruel and very difficult.’ Lord Lawson, her former Chancellor said: ‘Britain seemed doomed to continual economic decline. She changed all that and her tax reforms were emulated around the world. She did not surround herself with Yes-men but people who shared her ideas to rescue the economy. ‘I don’t want to be drawn on the difficulties at the end. I want to focus on the enormous achievement of her first ten years.’ Tories: Prime Minister David Cameron talks to Baroness Thatcher at 10 Downing Street in June 2010 . Lord Howe, . former Foreign Secretary, whose resignation speech led to Lady . Thatcher’s downfall, commented: ‘Britain, when we came to office, was in . the last chance saloon. People realised that we really had to do some . rather difficult things.’  Asked about his personal relationship with . her, he replied: ‘It was all a long time ago.’ Lord Saatchi, . chairman of Centre for Policy Studies, set up by Lady Thatcher in 1974, . declared: ‘Everyone wants to be immortal. Few are. Mrs Thatcher is. Why? Because her values are timeless, eternal. ‘She . developed all the winning arguments of our time – free markets, low . tax, a small state, independence, individuality, self-determination. The . result was a revolution in economic policy and three election victories . in a row.’ Lord Lamont, . another former chancellor, said: ‘The name Margaret Thatcher will . always be synonymous with the word “courage”. The word impossible barely . existed for her. We shall not see her like again.’ Kenneth Clarke, . now Minister without portfolio and one of Lady Thatcher’s Cabinet, . said: ‘It was conviction politics. She had a strong idea of what she . wanted to do and it was based on what she thought was the right thing to . do.’ Lord Patten, former cabinet minister, now chairman of the BBC Trust, said: ‘She made Britain governable again. We should all recognise her huge contribution to the history and well-being of this country.’ Respect: Tony Blair (pictured yesterday in Pennsylvania), who Lady Thatcher once described as her 'greatest achievement', was by far the warmest of senior Labour figures, hailing her as a 'towering political figure' Lord Archer, . former Tory deputy chairman, said: ‘The thing that always stands out is . her extreme loyalty. She never forgot her friends, ever. She loved this . country so dearly and was steely in her determination to see it great . again. And that is what she did.’ Justin Welby, . the Archbishop of Canterbury, noted Lady Thatcher’s religious faith. ‘It is right that today we give thanks for a life devoted to public . service, acknowledging also the faith that inspired and sustained her,’ he said. Tony Blair, . who Lady Thatcher once described as her ‘greatest achievement’, was by . far the warmest of senior Labour figures, hailing her as a ‘towering . political figure’. ‘Very few leaders get to change not only the political landscape of their country but of the world. Margaret was such a leader. Her global impact was vast. 'And some of the changes she made in Britain were, in certain respects at least, retained by the 1997 Labour government, and came to be implemented by governments around the world,’ he said. ‘As a person she was kind and generous spirited and was always immensely supportive to me as Prime Minister although we came from opposite sides of politics.’ Thoughts: Ed Miliband (pictured yesterday in Ipswich, Suffolk) said she would 'remain a controversial figure' Ed Miliband, Labour leader, said she would ‘always remain a controversial figure’. But he added: ‘She will be remembered as a unique figure. She reshaped the politics of a whole generation. She was Britain’s first woman Prime Minister. She moved the centre ground of British politics and was a huge figure on the world stage.’ Gordon Brown, who angered some Labour MPs when he invited Lady Thatcher for tea in Number Ten, hailed her ‘many decades of service’. ‘She will be remembered not only for being Britain’s first female Prime Minister and holding the office for 11 years, but also for the determination and resilience with which she carried out all her duties throughout her public life.’ Boris Johnson, London Mayor, said Lady Thatcher had ‘ended the defeatism and pessimism of the post-war period and unleashed a spirit of enterprise’. ‘She fought against the clubby, cosy, male-dominated consensus of both main parties – and she won.’ MAILONLINE & DAILY MAIL CAMPAIGN: HOW TO MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD .

"Milos Raonic has pulled out of the ATP World Tour Finals in London because of a thigh injury and will be replaced by David Ferrer. Ferrer, who has been practising at the O2 Arena all week as the first alternate, will take on Kei Nishikori on Thursday afternoon in the final round of matches in Group B. The Spaniard only missed out on a place in the top eight at the very last minute after Raonic defeated Roger Federer on his way to the final at the Paris Masters a fortnight ago. Milos Raonic announced his withdrawal from the ATP World Tour Finals at a press conference on Thursday . Raonic lost both of his matches on his debut at the tournament and revealed he suffered the injury in Tuesday's defeat by Andy Murray. 'I have a slight tear in my quad and a large area of swelling,' he said. 'It would be unfair to fans if I was to go out and play a mediocre match. If I was to step out on court I could lose up to six to eight weeks. That was a significant factor in my decision.' Raonic's decision potentially has a significant impact on the qualification hopes of both Nishikori and Murray, who meets Federer later on Thursday. Raonic, pictured in action against Andy Murray, suffered a thigh injury during defeat by the Scot . There had been a scenario whereby Murray could lose to Federer and still make the semi-finals if Nishikori had also lost to Raonic. But, instead of a three-way tie being decided by sets or games percentage, as would have been the case, a player playing fewer matches is automatically eliminated from the race leaving the remaining two players to be split by head-to-head. Because Murray lost his opening match to Nishikori, he must now beat Federer to stand a chance of going through. Should Nishikori lose, any win for Murray would be enough, but victory for the Japanese player would mean the Scot must win in straight sets and hope his games percentage is better than either Nishikori or Federer. Raonic's replacement David Ferrer plays a forehand during his match against Kei Nishikori at the O2 Arena . There is no way Ferrer can progress but the Spaniard is a player no one likes facing because of his resemblance to a human wall, and Nishikori will certainly not be expecting anything less than a stern test. Ferrer may also have extra motivation from the fact it was his loss to Nishikori in Paris that secured Raonic's place in London ahead of him. The Japanese player, who has his own injury worries after receiving treatment to his right wrist against Federer, has won five of their previous eight meetings, including all three this season, but every one has been extremely close.

"The National Security Agency can listen to domestic phone calls without a warrant, according to a disclosure by Representative Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, made during a briefing to members of Congress last Thursday. Listening to phone calls without a warrant is illegal - but according to Mr Nadler, the NSA does not obtain a warrant to listen to calls. Nadler said during the briefing that he was told that the contents of a phone call could be accessed 'simply based on an analyst deciding that.' Disclosure: Representative Jerrold Nadler has called into question the nature and legality of the NSA's operations in the U.S. If the NSA wants 'to listen to the phone,' an analyst's decision is sufficient, without any other legal authorization required, Nadler said he was informed. 'I was rather startled,' said Nadler, an attorney and congressman who serves on the House Judiciary committee. It was an exchange that took place between Nadler . and FBI director Robert Mueller at the briefing on Thursday that some . have taken to indicate the NSA illegally listens to U.S. phone calls. Mueller claimed that, to listen to a phone call, the government would need to . seek 'a special, a particularized order from the FISA court directed at . that particular phone of that particular individual.' Access: According to Nadler, he was told that the NSA could 'listen to the phone' at an individual analyst's discretion . Nadler asked whether information about that procedure was 'classified in any way?' 'I don't think so,' Mueller replied. 'Then I can say the following,' Nadler said. 'We heard precisely the . opposite at the briefing the other day. We heard precisely that you . could get the specific information from that telephone simply based on . an analyst deciding that... In other words, what you just said is . incorrect. So there's a conflict.' Nadler's statement is causing some, such as CNET, to claim an admission of illegal wiretapping by the NSA. The ambiguity of the phrase . 'information from that telephone' has caused others to argue that Nadler . didn't understand the previous briefing that he cited as being proof of . illegal surveillance. Mother Jones . suggests that 'information from that telephone' could mean one of many . things, and that Nadler may have been 'confusing the ability of an . analyst to get subscriber information for a phone number with the . ability to listen to the call itself.' Support: These latest allegations about the NSA's operations seem to support the claims made by Edward Snowden about the NSA's surveillance of U.S. citzens . The disclosure could confirm some of the allegations made by Edward . Snowden, the former NSA infrastructure analyst who leaked classified . documents to the Guardian and the Washington Post, who is now in hiding in Hong Kong. Snowden said in a video interview that, while . not all NSA analysts had this ability, he himself could, from Hawaii, 'wiretap . anyone from you or your accountant to a federal judge to even the president.' By law, NSA's intelligence gathering is limited to foreign . communications. The NSA's mission, as set forth in Executive Order 12333, is . to collect information that constitutes 'foreign intelligence or . counterintelligence' while not 'acquiring information concerning the . domestic activities of United States persons'. The same legal standards that apply to phone calls also apply to e-mail messages, text messages, and instant messages. The NSA has declared that it relies on the FBI to collect information on . foreign intelligence activities within the borders of the USA, while . confining its own activities within the USA to the embassies and . missions of foreign nations. CNET reports . that this latest revelation 'suggests the Justice Department has . secretly interpreted federal surveillance law to permit thousands of . low-ranking analysts to eavesdrop on phone calls'. Mission: The National Security Agency's surveillance is limited to gathering information on foreign communications . Wlliam Binney, a former NSA technical director who helped to modernize the agency's worldwide eavesdropping network, told the Daily Caller . this week that the NSA records the phone calls of 500,000 to one . million people who are on its so-called target list, and perhaps even . more. 'They look through these phone numbers and they target those and . that's what they record,' Binney said. A . requirement of the 2008 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is that . the NSA 'may not intentionally . target any person known at the time of acquisition to be located in the . United States.' According to CNET, legal experts say a 'possible . interpretation of that language is that the agency may vacuum up . everything it can . domestically - on the theory that indiscriminate data acquisition was . not intended to target a specific American citizen.' NSA . Director Keith Alexander said this week that his agency's analysts . abide by the law. 'They do this lawfully. They take compliance . oversight, protecting civil liberties and privacy and the security of . this nation to their heart every day.'","Representative Jerrold Nadler said last week that he had been informed in a briefing that the NSA could 'listen to the phone' without obtaining a warrant .

"The first sign that Margaret Thatcher was losing her vice-like grip on world affairs came shortly before the 1997 General Election which ended 18 years of Tory rule and brought Tony Blair to power. As Prime Minister she had famously survived on four hours sleep a night and the pace had never slowed after her fall from power seven years earlier. She was in huge demand on the international lecture circuit, travelling the globe to promote her free-market philosophy. Then, abruptly, at the end of 1996, her aides detected an uncharacteristic mental frailty in the Iron Lady. She began to repeat herself in discussions. But it was not just that her famed mental powers were dimming. Lady Thatcher was having difficulties with her hearing as well. Only her intimates were permitted to know that there was anything wrong with her. Lady Thatcher, on a park bench in London enjoying the sunshine in March last year with her carer Kate . One of the last pictures: Lady Thatcher in Battersea Park last year with her carers and police officer . 'She could no longer follow an argument from beginning to end,' said one close friend. 'She would lose the point halfway through. It was very confusing for her and unsettling for us. It was hard for everyone. The hearing loss exacerbated the problem. 'She was still functioning – and functioning well – but no longer at the extraordinary breakneck speed we were used to. It was difficult to know if she understood what was happening to her. If she did, she didn't tell us.' No one outside her inner circle knew . of her condition. Nor did anyone realise that, four years later, in . August 2001, Lady Thatcher had a serious stroke while on holiday with . her husband Denis; they were marking their golden wedding anniversary on . the Portuguese island of Madeira, where they had honeymooned. On her return to Britain doctors realised she had also suffered a series of small strokes in the months before the holiday. Lady Thatcher blithely insisted to friends that nothing was wrong. She had had the occasional stumble, she would admit, but nothing more. 'I don't think she could ever acknowledge the fact that she could be ill,' said one close friend. Great powers diminished: Lady Thatcher patting a playful dog . The Iron Lady was helped to her feet in Battersea Park, south London, by her carers . Around . that time she became patron of Alzheimer's Research UK, and it was not . until many months later, in early 2002, that the news of her failing . health was made public by her office. Then . came the death of her beloved Denis in 2003, after 52 years of . marriage. It was a shattering blow to someone in such a fragile mental . state. Grief stricken, she slipped into depression and her mind . deteriorated further. Her daughter Carol revealed in her memoir that her mother actually often forgot that her husband had died. 'I had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again. Every time it finally sank in that she'd lost her husband of more than 50 years she would look at me  sadly and ask softly, “Oh. Were we all there?”.' Carol also disclosed in that memoir the exact moment she realised there was a problem. Over lunch with friends in 2000 Lady Thatcher, in a discussion about the war in Bosnia, inexplicably confused the former Yugoslavia with the Falklands War, arguably one of her greatest triumphs. 'I almost fell off my chair,' said Carol. 'Watching her struggle with her words and her memory, I couldn't believe it. I had always thought of her as ageless, timeless and 100 per cent cast-iron damage-proof.' Bitter blow: Lady Thatcher was devastated by the death of her beloved husband Denis; the couple are pictured left on their wedding day in 1951, and right a few months before his death in 2003 . Support: Baroness Thatcher with her daughter Carol visiting the QE2 in Southampton in June 2008 . Family: The former Prime Minister in 2011 with her son Mark and his wife Sarah . By now her doctors were insisting that she stopped making public speeches because she was on ever-stronger medication and her memory lapses were becoming more pronounced and more frequent. She reluctantly agreed. For her staff, at least, there were some advantages to the slowdown in the schedule. Her fearsome temper tantrums became a thing of the past. The Iron Lady took on a new and more gentle persona. In 2005 she ignored the doctors to make a short stirring speech, with jokes, at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Knightsbridge at her 80th birthday party. The Queen and Prince Philip were present along with virtually all of the men who served in her Cabinets. After a faltering start, she was word perfect. It was the last public speech she was to make. In 2008 she was admitted to hospital for tests after she felt ill at a House of Lords dinner. It was the beginning of the end of her remarkable public life. Aide: Cynthia Crawford, left, stayed loyal to her old boss until the end of Lady Thatcher's life . Friends: The likes of Lord Powell, left, and Conor Burns, right, took turns visiting Lady Thatcher at the Ritz . Her absence from the wedding of Prince William in April 2011 was the most significant sign of the deterioration in her health. In fact, one of her last public appearances was her faltering photocall on the steps of her home after she returned from two weeks in hospital in November 2010. By now, Lady Thatcher, who once poignantly declared that 'home is where you go when you've nowhere else to go', rarely left her four-storey home in Belgravia. Her constant companions were her devoted carers, New Zealanders Kate and Janice, and her ever-faithful police protection officers. Trips out were increasingly rare. In January 2012 she did venture out, to a dinner party at the home of Jonathan Aitken, a former Tory Cabinet minister who once dated Carol. Tragically, she seemed to be unaware who was Prime Minister. 'She obviously didn't get who David Cameron was. I can't ever say I felt protective to her when she was in power, but I felt very lovingly protective towards her then,' he said. In that late period of her life she also had the occasional lunch at the Ritz, where staff always knew to serve chicken consomme and a main course of lemon sole; to ask her preference would have led to too much confusion. There was one further, poignant sighting of Lady Thatcher, on a park bench in London enjoying the sunshine in March last year with her carer Kate. Gone were her high heels, replaced by comfortable sandals and a walking stick – a testament to her frailty. Then, at Christmas, she went back to hospital for minor surgery to remove a growth from her bladder. When she came out she was even more uncertain on her feet, and a return home was out of the question. A police car outside The Ritz Hotel after Margaret Thatcher's death yesterday . Recuperation: Baroness Thatcher started the year convalescing at the Ritz in central London after undergoing minor surgery over Christmas . Tributes: Notes and bouquets were piling up outside the former prime minister's home in London following the news of her death . So she moved quietly into a suite at . the Ritz – one of her favourite places – and she was invited by its . owners the Barclay brothers to stay there for the foreseeable future. She never left. Her two . carers took it in turns to stay with her. There were photos of Denis, . her children and grandchildren on the mantlepiece in the suite. The same group of friends who took it in turns to see her in Belgravia were put on a rota at the Ritz. They included Alison Wakeham, the wife of John Wakeham who was one of the Tory ministers badly injured in the Brighton bomb; Lord Powell, who was her foreign policy adviser; Lord Forsyth, another former minister; Conor Burns, the MP for Bournemouth West; and Mark Worthington, who for more than two decades was her loyal private secretary. Cynthia Crawford, nicknamed Crawfie, who was her personal assistant in Downing Street, would stay for one or two weeks at a time. Each day she was dressed immaculately. Her trademark bouffant hair, elegantly coiffed, was now grey. By now it wasn't just the memory loss which afflicted her. She was struggling to speak because she found it increasingly difficult to form words. It was why only those closest to her were permitted to the Ritz to see her. Sir Bernard Ingham, her doughty press secretary at Downing Street, saw her a month ago. 'She looked immaculate and was keen to get involved in the conversation. Sometimes she started to speak and then the thought deserted her or she couldn't get the words out.' He then added sadly: 'It never occurred to me that it would be the last time that I would ever see her.' MAILONLINE & DAILY MAIL CAMPAIGN: HOW TO MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD .

"When scores of dead seals with mysterious 'corkscrew' injuries began washing up on shores, all sorts of theories were put forward. Boat propellers were the chief suspect, although hungry sharks and attacks by aggressive territorial male seals weren't ruled out. Scientists, the National Trust, RSPCA and even police investigated the disturbing phenomenon. But now academics believe they have found the answer – cannibalism. Cannibalism victim: One of the 50 bloodied seals washed up dead on beaches across Britain. Experts now believe the fatal injuries were caused by hungry adult males . A team of marine biologists concluded the horrific lacerations – likened to be being passed through a giant pencil sharpener - could have been caused by hungry adult males. Dr David Thompson, senior research assistant at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, said: 'Our investigations have led us to believe that it is highly likely cannibalism was the cause.' Scientists were stumped by the deaths of more than 50 grey and common seals found on an eight-mile stretch of coast between Wells and Blakeney on the Norfolk coast between November 2009 and August 2010. The problem was also identified in Scotland. In the Firth of Tay, seven seals were found dead out of a breeding population of only 150. Another 18 were discovered in St Andrews Bay and the Firth of Forth. All had the unusual injuries - a smooth-edged cut that spiralled up to two times around the body. Post-mortem examinations failed to provide an answer but researchers guessed the likely cause was a rotating single blade. Seals normally swim away from noisy boats but they theorised they could be sucked in by an as yet unidentified vessel. The breakthrough came after a student researcher at St Andrews' Sea Mammal Research Unit saw an adult seal force a pup under water. Under attack: The common seal (left) and grey seals (right) are believed to have been viciously attacked by hungry adult males. The corkscrew injuries were initially blamed on boat propellers until an expert witnessed an attack on a pup which resulted in similar lacerations . During the brutal attack, it held its victim with its fore-flippers and clamped its jaws around its neck. It then pulled upward while pushing down with the flippers, leaving the corkscrew incision. Dr Thompson – whose team tagged a number of grey seals in the Firth of Forth for the study - added about six a year had been found dead with the same injuries for the past two years. 'Seal cannibalism is rare but not unheard of and our research has shown evidence of seals killing this way back in the late 1980s,' he said. 'We can't be 100 per cent certain this is what happened in Norfolk but we believe it is highly likely to be the case.' Wells harbour master Robert Smith said: 'People here are very passionate about seals and we took a lot of stick at the time when people thought it was the wind farm boats causing the deaths. 'It's nice to be able to show that this was not the case.' David Balston, of the UK Chamber of Shipping, added: 'While the horrific injuries remain a cause for concern, the evidence that these were predominantly the result of attacks by other seals demonstrates why accurate science should drive the debate rather than raw emotion.' The deaths were of particular concern because populations of common seals had already been devastated. Outbreaks of the phocine distemper virus in 1988 and 2002 resulted in losses of around 20 per cent. Numbers have made a slow recovery since then.","About 50 seals with bizarre injuries washed up on British beaches .

"Chinese officials are fighting back against giant hornets which have killed 42 people and left 1,600 injured. In China's northern Shaanxi province, whole cities have been terrorised by the world's largest hornet which has started attacking people. Now government officials have started fighting fire with fire - literally - by burning and gassing the thumb-sized bugs out of their hives. Scroll down for video . This huge hornet nest - filled with white eggs - was cleared by specialists in Ankang, Shaanxi province, as China fights back against the predatory insects which have killed 42 people so far this year . September and October are breeding season for the creatures, meaning they are more active than usual . Government workers wearing protective clothing are using every means at their disposal, including fire, to get rid of the killer bugs which have been attacking cities in northern China . Workers wearing protective clothing have moved in to eradicate the nightmare insects before any more people are injured. Horrific pictures have emerged of wounds the size of bullet holes left in the arms of victims after being stung. Over the past three months the cities of Angkang, Hanzhong and Shangluo have been worst affected. Experts have suggested the high number of attacks this year could be down to a growth in habitat or unusually warm weather making the hornets more agitated . One specialist wearing a protective suit is attacked by a swarm while trying to eradicate the hornets which victims say can chase people for up to 600ft after attacking . Firefighters and residents had been left to battle the bugs alone but now the government has sent in special eradication teams . One victim told local media that 'the . more you run, the more they want to chase you' and some victims . described being chased about 200 metres (656 feet) by the deadly . insects. Authorities have mobilised a special medic team and trained more medical personnel to treat victims. The insects' highly toxic stings can lead to anaphylactic shock and renal failure. One of the victims, named only as Mu, said she has spent two months in a hospital undergoing 13 dialysis treatments. Until government specialists arrived today locals have had to tackle the wasps themselves . With no protective clothing, brave residents have used whatever means they can to exterminate the pests . The aggressive animals will feed on honeybees, severing their heads, wings and legs before carrying the body back to their young . She has 200 stitches, but still cannot move her legs. She told Xinhua, the Chinese state-run news agency: 'The hornets were horrifying'. 'They hit right at my head and covered my legs. All of a sudden I was stung and I couldn't move. 'Even now, my legs are covered with sting holes.' Attacks on humans are rare and specialists are unable to fully explain why this year has seen so many more cases. Theories include increased plant growth boosting the number of the insects, and unusually warm weather making the creatures more agitated. Victims of the hornets have been left with bullet-hole sized wounds in their arms and legs . The poison in the stings can lead to anaphylactic shock and kidney failure at high doses . September and October is the breeding season for the big bugs, meaning now is when they are most active. The insects are an aggressive and predatory animal, however, and will send out scouts to look for honeybee hives for them to colonise. When one is found the scout will leave . a pheromone trail which other hornets will then follow, before using . their jaws to decapitate the bees. After slaughtering thousands of the much smaller creatures, the hornets will then take over the nest for themselves. The species has already spread to France and fears are growing that giant Asian hornets are headed for Britain. The thumb-sized insects have been attacking people and experts struggle to explain why . There are fears the insects could head to Britain after spreading to France in 2004 in a delivery of pottery . The hornets use their powerful sting, jaws, and superior size to kill up to 30,000 bees an hour . The deadly species are four times the size of British honeybees and have been known to wipe out entire hives as they look to claim the nest as their own . The species is four times the size of our native honeybees which are already struggling due to a mysterious syndrome which wipes out entire nests. The dark invaders with yellow feet are thought to have arrive in France in a delivery of Chinese pottery from the Far East in late 2004. The insects have colonised huge swathes of France, spreading along waterways, and with a few hornets capable of destroying 30,000 bees in a couple of hours, honey production has plummeted. It has so far colonised 39 of France’s 100 administrative departments.","Chinese authorities have sent exterminators to Shaanxi province .

"The volunteer nurse who is being monitored inside a Queensland hospital for Ebola has tested negative, a Queensland Health official has confirmed. Sue Ellen Kovack was tested for the deadly virus on her return from Sierra Leone where she was volunteering with the Red Cross in the fight against Ebola. There were fears the 57-year-old, from Cairns, was suffering from the illness she was helping to treat after she reported feeling a fever at 1pm AEST on Thursday. Ms Kovack was put under observation and quarantined at Cairns Hospital. Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young stated on Friday morning that initial tests taken have returned a negative result. Scroll down for video . Sue Ellen Kovack volunteered as a nurse treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone last month . Ms Kovack posted a number of snaps of her on the job in Sierra Leone on her Facebook page . There are an estimated 7,200 Ebola cases in West Africa, according to the latest figures from the Centre for Disease Control . Dr Young said the woman was likely to remain under observation for at least another 24-hours. 'This is a necessary precaution given the patient has been to West Africa and has had a fever within the incubation period of 21 days. For the sake of her health and to follow due diligence, we want to be sure she is clear of Ebola virus disease as well as any other disease.' Dr Young said regardless of the outcome of the tests, the broader community was not at risk of contracting EVD. Ms Kovack just returned to Australia on Tuesday after a month volunteering for the Red Cross in the West African nation. Red Cross Australia confirmed one of their aid workers was under observation for the deadly virus. 'Our heartfelt thoughts are with the Red Cross aid worker and her family. We will do everything we can to support her at this difficult time,' the organisation's head of international program Peter Walton said in a statement to the Red Cross Australia Twitter page. Mr Walton later told 9News: '[Ms Kovack's] well, I've spoken with her recently. 'We just have to play a bit of a waiting game. 'She's in good spirits - she's feeling good at the moment.' Ms Kovack decked out in medical gear during her stint in the West African nation . Dr Jeannette Young broke the news at a press conference on Thursday afternoon . A friend of Ms Kovack's, Jennifer King, told ABC's Lateline the volunteer nurse was 'popular' and 'well-known' in the Cairns medical community, and her situation had sparked an outpouring of support from her colleagues at the north Queensland hospital. Ms King said her friend of 25 years was used to working in the tough conditions of African nations. 'She wants to help people, she's incredibly compassionate and she's selfless like not many people on earth,' Ms King said. 'A bunch of the nurses [at Cairns Hospital] have gone down to Accident and Emergency [department] to offer to nurse Sue Ellen, which is really brave. 'They're upset and they want to help.' But Ms Kovack's humanitarian efforts have been slammed by outspoken Federal MP Bob Katter. The member for Kennedy - whose electorate takes in the southern area of Cairns and the town's airport - said her volunteering pursuits had put the nation at risk. Mr Katter said it was 'unbelievable and incomprehensive' how a person could get into Australia from an Ebola-infected country. 'There cannot be any compromise with this,' Mr Katter said. 'If you want to go to one of these countries, however laudable your motivation, I am sorry but when you return to Australia, you must be quarantined for three weeks - not home quarantined.' Mr Katter said Australian aid workers travelling to west Africa, including Ms Kovack, were putting Australia at risk. 'We love these people, and we honour these Australians for being self-sacrificing, but compared to the risk they create for our country, it is not remotely comparable. One person's moral and humanitarian ambitions are being carried out at a very grave cost to Australia,' he said. But Queensland's chief medical officer Dr Jeannette Young praised Ms Kovack's efforts and said she had acted appropriately when raising the alarm to health authorities. 'I think she's an amazing lady to go to Africa and provide that service,' Dr Young said. She added: 'She has done everything appropriately.' Ms Kovack has been in isolation since she returned home as is the protocol for medical workers who have treated Ebola patients overseas. Dr Young said Ms Kovack had been testing herself in the 'isolation' of her own home and had not been into the Cairns community since she returned on Tuesday. 'This morning she rang up as part of [national health] protocol because she developed a low-grade fever of 37.6 degrees Celsius. 'But we felt it important that she come into Cairns Hospital for Ebola virus disease.' Ms Kovack is originally from Toronto, Canada but is living in Cairns, Queensland . Cairns Hospital where the 57-year-old is under observation and quarantined . Dr Young stressed it was almost impossible that Ms Kovack to have infected other people, including her housemate who is showing no symptoms or passengers on her flight, as she did not develop symptoms until Thursday morning. Doctors awaited the results of a blood test and received the results early Friday morning as the sample had been sent to Brisbane for testing on Thursday afternoon. Dr Young said the actual blood testing process took about four hours. A Federal Department of Health spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia any health care worker who comes back from an affected country needs to monitor their health - including taking their temperature twice a day - and cannot return to work for 21 days. Health Minister Peter Dutton has moved to reassure the public that talking to people arriving from Ebola-hit countries is still the best method of screening for the deadly disease. He said doctors still backed the process to identify and contact people arriving into the country who may have been exposed to the disease. 'I think that's the more effective screening process at the moment, but these things evolve,' he told the ABC. Mr Dutton said introducing a screening in arrivals halls could be problematic. 'It provides a sort of air of complacency if you like,' he told the ABC. 'So people come through, they feel unwell a couple of days later and they think ""No, no, I've just been through that screening process and I wasn't picked up, I'm ok"".' Mr Dutton reiterated the World Health Organisation had not asked Australia for on-the-ground health workers in the stricken African countries. But he said that advice may change over time. Australia will send help if a case presents in the region, for example in PNG, the minister says. 'We would be expected within our region to rapidly respond, and we have the capacity to do that with a team out of Darwin ... and resources within Canberra,' Mr Dutton said. Before she left for Sierra Leone, Ms Kovack spoke to media about her journey, and was actively keeping her friends and family up to date on Facebook. 'I'm a little bit nervous, a little bit anxious but healthily anxious I think,' she told local newspaper The Cairns Post. In an interview with the ABC last month, she said it was her responsibility to help those in need. 'I care about humanity and if I have what people need, I would like to use these skills. 'Why me? Well, if not me then who?' Ms Kovack said. Except for the fever, Dr Young said Ms Kovack was 'perfectly well' but because of the circumstances: 'I am treating it as if it was (Ebola)'. She said there was no risk to fellow passengers on Ms Kovack's flights home. 'She did not have any symptoms at all when she was on those flights, so there is no risk at all,' she said. 'The Ebola virus is very difficult to transmit. 'It's not transmitted through the air - you need to be exposed to secretions: vomit, diarrhoea, blood. 'She doesn't have any symptoms producing those secretions.' Ms Kovack is expected to find out on Friday morning whether or not she has the deadly virus . Ms Kovack recently shared happy snaps of her in Sierra Leone, dressed in quarantine uniforms and being sprayed by decontamination hoses. On September 23, she wrote: 'Big day... Have taken our first bloods from our first ebola survivor at the (International Federation of the Red Cross) treatment centre. It was not the first time Ms Kovack had travelled overseas to help those in need. She had previously worked with the Red Cross in war-torn South Sudan and had volunteered in Sierra Leone in 2002. The Ebola virus has infected an estimated 7,200 people, according to the World Health Organisation. More than 3300 have died. There have been no recorded cases in Australia. Last month, a Gold Coast man was placed in isolation after he was feared to be suffering the deadly illness. He was quickly cleared of the condition.","Red Cross nurse Sue Ellen Kovack has tested negative for Ebola virus .

"Arsenal target Sami Khedira says he cannot see himself leaving Real Madrid in January. The Germany international is out of contract in the summer and has so far failed to agree terms on a new contract. He is free to talk to foreign clubs in January and Madrid want an answer otherwise they will look to sell rather than lose him for nothing. However, Khedira said: ‘Right now, I cannot see any reason why I would leave the club this winter.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sami Khedira trains with Real Madrid team-mates . Arsenal target Sami Khedira says he cannot see himself leaving Real Madrid in January . Khedira is helped during a stretching routine while away on international duty with Germany this week . Talking to Germany’s Kicker magazine, he added: ‘Real Madrid is a great club to be at. This club has a place in my heart and there is absolutely no reason for me to say that I want to or have to leave. ‘I get the feeling I am still wanted (by coach Carlo Ancelotti).’ The 27-year-old recovered from tearing his knee ligaments to play a part in Real Madrid’s 10th Champions League triumph, yet he took the bold decision to drop out of the World Cup final less than two months later when beset by another injury. Khedira still believes that Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti still wants him at the club . ‘I would make the same decision if I had to again,’ Khedira said. ‘But the moment I realised that I could not play - that was by far the toughest and saddest moment of my career. ‘I had to fight with my body, my condition and with myself as a person,’ Khedira said. ‘I was just really empty and drained. I needed a bit of time before I really recovered.’ Khedira made two brief appearances in Real’s first two games of the season before a muscular injury ruled him out for six weeks. He has since made two substitute appearances in La Liga, but was left out of Ancelotti’s squad for the win over Rayo Vallecano last weekend, raising doubts that he had a future at the club.","Arsenal are keen on signing Real Madrid's Sami Khedira .

"England have named Anthony Watson on the right wing for Saturday's QBE International against South Africa in the only change to the team defeated by New Zealand. Watson, who trained alongside his England team-mates during a session at Pennyhill Park on Wednesday, made his debut as a second-half replacement in the 24-21 loss to the All Blacks and has been given his first Test start after Bath team-mate Semesa Rokoduguni was ruled out of selection by a thigh injury. The 20-year-old's place on the bench is taken by Harlequins' Marland Yarde in the only other adjustment to the 23 picked to face the Springboks at Twickenham.

The England squad trained at Pennyhill Park on Wednesday, with the squad taking part in a warm-up run here . Stuart Lancaster (left, smiling during training) has chosen to give Watson his debut, with Chris Robshaw (right) captaining the side . Starting XV: M Brown, A Watson, B Barritt, K Eastmond, J May, O Farrell, D Care, J Marler, D Hartley, D Wilson, D Attwood, C Lawes, T Wood, D Attwood, C Lawes, T Wood, C Robshaw (c), B Vunipola. Replacements: R Webber, M Mullan, K Brookes, G Kruis, B Morgan, B Youngs, G Ford, M Yarde. 'Anthony has been pushing hard for a while and has been in impressive form for Bath and in training with us,' head coach Stuart Lancaster said. 'It was great that he got on against New Zealand and we feel he's ready to start. Equally, it's good to have Marland back in the matchday 23.' Second row Courtney Lawes and hooker Dylan Hartley have been cleared to take their places in the starting XV after recovering from the concussions they suffered against New Zealand. The Northampton forwards have been following the graduated return to play protocols this week and have been passed fit. Tom Wood, a third Saints player, starts after becoming a doubt to face South Africa with an injury that England would only describe as 'soreness'. James Haskell had been retained in the squad as cover for Wood and he now misses out. Bath right wing Watson made his debut for Stuart Lancaster as a second half substitute against New Zealand . Danny Care - bursting through against New Zealand - is ready to earn his 50th cap for England against South Africa . Lancaster's decision to make only the one, injury-enforced, change to his starting XV is born out of a desire to see England redeem themselves after throwing away a winning position against New Zealand. They led 14-11 at half-time but were picked apart in a one-sided second half as they crashed to a fourth successive defeat. Among those under pressure to perform against South Africa is Harlequins scrum-half Danny Care, who wins his 50th cap at Twickenham on Saturday. 'Congratulations to Danny. It'll be a special moment for him and I'm sure he'll rise to the occasion,' Lancaster said.

"A baby born with part of her brain outside her skull is thriving despite doctors giving her little chance of survival. Faith Martin, now aged three months, was not expected to breathe on her own when she was born. Doctors also explained to her heartbroken parents Jessica . Williams, 20, and Aaron Martin, 21, that they wouldn't intervene if she couldn't. Faith Martin was born with part of her brain outside her skull and she was not expected to survive . Faith (pictured with her mother, Jessica) was diagnosed during a scan and her parents were warned she might not be able to breathe when she was born. Doctors said if this was the case, they wouldn't intervene . During a 17-week pregnancy scan at . Middlesbrough's James Cook University Hospital her parents were told she had the rare condition . encephalocele. Encephalocele is described as a sac-like protrusion of the brain, and the membranes that cover it, through an opening in the skull. It happens when the neural tube - an embryo's precursor to the central nervous system which comprises the brain and spinal cord - does not close completely during pregnancy. Ms Williams, who is also mother to one-year-old Logan, said: ‘I went for my first scan and they said that there was a problem. ‘We didn't know what to think and the consultant came to see us. I was in shock. ‘They knew straight away that the skull hadn't fused together properly and that there was a hole in the back of her skull.’ Because prospects for babies with this condition are often catastrophic – many do not survive and others are left with lifelong brain damage and other neurological problems - many parents choose to terminate the pregnancy. When Faith was born she cried immediately, proving that she could breathe. She has now had surgery to remove the protrusion . Faith's parents, Jessica Williams and Aaron Martin, were told she could be severely disabled but they did not consider aborting her as they wanted to give her a chance. They are pictured with Faith and their son, Logan . Ms Williams said: ‘The consultant said that he thought that she was going to be severely disabled. ‘All along we were told it was the part of the brain that controlled breathing that was affected. Encephalocele is a rare type of neural tube defect which is present at birth and affects the brain. The neural tube is a narrow channel that folds and closes during the third and fourth weeks of pregnancy to form the brain and spinal cord. Encephalocele is a sac-like protrusion of the brain, and the membranes that cover it, through an opening in the skull. It happens when the neural tube doesn't close properly during pregnancy. It occurs in about one baby in every 10,000. Babies with the condition can also have a build-up of fluid in the brain, loss of strength in the arms and legs, an unusually small head, poor coordination, developmental delays, vision problems and fits. Source: Centre for Disease Control and Prevention . ‘We were told that most babies that they knew of had died from it. ‘They said that a termination was completely up to us and did we want to go away and think about it? ‘But if there was any chance at all then we wanted to give it to her. ‘We never gave termination a thought.’ The pair met with a consultant at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI) who offered them some hope. Ms Williams said: ‘He said that he'd seen them much bigger and seen the baby be OK in the end.’ To avoid any damage to the protrusion, Ms Williams had planned a Caesarean section birth. However her waters broke on October 13 and the C-section was brought forward. Ms Williams said: ‘She cried straight away - and a couple of minutes later there was another cry. ‘The consultant said he was happy enough to let her be left with us on the ward. I always clung onto the hope that she would be OK.’ The pair were sent home with their new baby the day after with weekly visits to a nurse-led clinic planned. Faith had a MRI scan four days after she was born. Faith is not believed to have suffered any long term effects as a result of her condition . ‘It went from being the “breathing part” of her brain to “a part” of her brain,’ said Ms Williams. However, the protrusion grew and by December it was 21cm in diameter from 6cm at birth. Caring for her was difficult, says Ms Williams, as her protrusion was painful when touched. She said: ‘She was in a lot of pain and had to be put on her side.’ An operation took place at Newcastle's RVI on January 10 when she was three months old. This saw surgeons remove the protrusion - which contained excess brain fluid and dead brain matter - and fit a shunt to redirect any further fluid build-up to her stomach. Ms Williams and Mr Martin now describe Faith as their 'little miracle' and say she is doing everything a normal three-month-old is expected to do . Faith now needs MRI scans every six months and checks-ups to make sure she's developing as expected. Ms Williams said: ‘We came home and she's been fine and she's been doing everything at three months that she should be doing and she will lead a totally normal life.’ She added: ‘It proves that doctors can be wrong as this outcome just wasn't an option for her. ‘She's quite a determined little thing. She's our little miracle.’ A spokeswoman for South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘We give women as much information as we possibly can to help them make informed choices and we will support them in every way possible, whatever they decide to do.’","Faith Martin was born with a birth defect called encephalocele .

"A mother says she gave birth to a perfectly healthy daughter despite doctors advising her to terminate her pregnancy because the baby was ‘brain damaged’. Liane Stooke, 38, says it was only her mother’s instinct that saved baby Miley, two. Mrs Stooke said: ‘We were told Miley was probably severely brain damaged and wouldn't be able to communicate with or recognise us. Liane and Iain Stooke (pictured with their children Miley, two, Bailey, four, and Aaron, nine) were told Miley would be born severely brain damaged and doctors suggested they considered aborting her . ‘It was a terrible decision to have to come to. We agonised over what we should do right up until the last minute.’ Mrs Stooke, and her husband Iain, 38, were delighted when they discovered they had conceived their third child. But their joy turned to despair when an MRI scan revealed a shadow on their unborn daughter's brain. Mrs Stooke said: ‘We were so happy that our two sons would have a little brother or sister. ‘It felt awful to see the doctors looking so worried. They immediately ordered another urgent scan.’ The repeat scan at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol apparently confirmed Mr and Mrs Stooke's worst fears - their daughter was diagnosed with a condition called holoprosencephaly, meaning she was probably severely brain damaged. The couple agonised over the decision but decided to give Miley a chance. They were shocked when she was born and turned out to be completely healthy . Mrs Stooke said: 'It was a waking nightmare. We agonised every minute over what to do - and every time I felt her kick inside me, my heart broke' ‘The doctors said she might never walk, talk, or recognise our faces,’ said Mrs Stooke, a bank administrator. ‘It was also possible she'd be physically and facially deformed. There were a lot of unknowns.’ Although Mrs Stooke was, at 30 weeks pregnant, beyond the normal limit for abortion, doctors advised termination as an option because holoprosencephaly would prevent the child from enjoying a meaningful quality of life. Holoprosencephaly is a condition in which the front part of the brain of an embryo fails to form two hemispheres. The condition varies in severity but about 80 per cent of children with holoprosencephaly have facial abnormalities. Takling about Miley's birth Mrs Stooke said: 'The midwives were baffled. The doctors ran the standard tests and Miley passed them all with flying colours. She was completely healthy' Almost all children with the condition experience developmental delays and many have seizures. Most babies with the condition do not survive infancy. The condition affects about one in 10,000 live-born babies. ‘The doctor said it wasn't too late if we wanted to abort the baby - he made it sound almost as if there was no other option,’ said Mrs Stooke.

I thought I was watching someone else getting the news. It was a dreadful experience.’ Mrs Stooke added: ‘It was a waking nightmare. We agonised every minute over what to do - and every time I felt her kick inside me, my heart broke. ‘We didn't know whether we could face aborting our baby, but at the same time we wondered how we would cope with a disabled child.’ Six weeks before her due date the couple arrived at the hospital for a meeting where they would give their final decision. ‘Driving to the hospital, even at that late stage, we still didn't know what to do,’ said Mrs Stooke. ‘I just couldn't let go of my child, but I also had to think of the baby's quality of life. ‘My instinct was that if the child would one day be capable of recognising us and of knowing who we are, we couldn't go through with it. ‘We were told there was still a very slim chance that the baby would recognise us. We exchanged a look and both knew instantly that we couldn't agree to the termination.’ The couple braced themselves and Mrs Stooke delivered her daughter by Caesarean section in October 2011. After the birth, the couple, from Bristol, were amazed to discover that, far from being physically deformed, their daughter was perfectly well. Mr and Mrs Stooke said they were initially relieved after the birth but that they then started to feel angry when they thought about how close they had come to aborting Miley. Miley is pictured with her brother, Aaron . Mrs Stooke said: ‘The midwives were baffled. The doctors ran the standard tests and Miley passed them all with flying colours. ‘Two days later Miley had another MRI scan and we were told she didn't have holoprosencephaly at all. In fact, she was completely healthy. ‘The only explanation is that the original imaging and diagnosis had been completely wrong.’ Relief turned to anger as Mr and Mrs Stooke realised how close they came to terminating the pregnancy. They wrote to their local NHS trust expecting an acknowledgement and explanation for the mistakes which had been made. Dr Chris Burton, medical director of North Bristol NHS Trust said: ‘North Bristol NHS Trust investigated Mr and Mrs Stooke's concerns thoroughly and provided a full response in February 2012, in which we expressed our unreserved sympathy for the distress they suffered. Mrs Stooke said: 'Miley's just perfect. I'm just so glad I trusted my mother's instinct and gave my girl the chance to live' ‘We are happy to meet with the family to discuss any on-going concerns that they may have. ‘This was a very difficult diagnosis to make and a number of very experienced and highly skilled professionals considered carefully how to provide that information to the family. ‘Analysing and diagnosing the developing brain of an unborn baby is a difficult process and these cases are very rare. ‘The circumstances surrounding Mr and Mrs Stooke's pregnancy are also very rare and highlight the importance of providing the right support to couples through upsetting times.’ Now two years old, Miley has met all her developmental milestones and walks, talks and laughs along with her brothers Aaron, nine, and Bailey, four. Mrs Stooke said: ‘Miley's just perfect. I'm just so glad I trusted my mother's instinct and gave my girl the chance to live.’","Liane and Iain Stooke were told baby Miley was brain damaged after a scan .

"The FBI has joined a desperate hunt for a 12-year-old girl who was last seen leaving home to walk half a mile to school on Tuesday. Jasmine Leighlin Baker waved goodbye to her parents and left their home in Perry Hall, Maryland at 7.30am to walk to Perry Hall Middle School, where she is a sixth grader. When she failed to return home after school at around 3pm on Tuesday, her mother called the school but she was told the girl had been absent that day. 'She's a child, she's just a baby,' her mother Tina told WBAL as she pleaded for her daughter's return. 'If anybody knows anything or if somebody has her, or if she sees this, she needs to know that everybody loves her.' Scroll down for video . Where is she? Jasmine Leighlin Baker, 12, has not been seen since Tuesday morning when she waved goodbye to her parents and started the half a mile walk to school - but she never arrived . Her father Robert told reporters that nothing seemed amiss when she left on Tuesday morning. 'She just left for school, everything was fine,' he said. 'She said goodbye to her mother, told her she loved her - and never made it to school.' Her mother also expressed her anger that the school had not told her sooner that her daughter had not turned up for classes. 'It would really be nice to know sooner rather than later,' she said. 'I found out that my child was absent from school because she didn't come home from school.' Fears: The girl's parents, Tina and Robert, appealed for the public's help in finding the 12-year-old girl . Search: A missing poster shows more images of the young girl, who is a sixth-grade student . They said she usually leaves their home on the 4200 block of Soth Ave and takes a left on Deborah Ave before crossing Joppa Road to the back of school property - a walk that is just half a mile. Friends and community members have handed out fliers to passing motorists. FBI spokeswoman Amy J. Thoreson said the agency is putting up billboards around the Baltimore region with details and a photograph of the missing girl. The case is also being investigated by the Baltimore County Police Crimes Against Children Unit. 'Somebody knows where she is,' Cpl. John Wachter of the Baltimore County Police Department told WBAL. 'We just need that person to call us and let us know so we can take her home.' Nearby: Perry Hall Middle School is just a few streets away from the family's home in Nottingham, Maryland . Police added that no Amber Alert was made after the girl disappeared because they do not have any evidence she was abducted. She is described as white, 5-feet-5 tall and 175 pounds. She has blue eyes and long brown hair with blond and red streaks. Investigators say she was last seen wearing blue jeans and a brown jacket.

Republic of Ireland boss O'Neill (right) and his assistant Keane cast an eye over their charges in Dublin . ‘The FAI and I have been fully briefed on the circumstances of what happened at the team hotel last night,’ O’Neill read. ‘Roy asked that the Gardai (police) be called and has notified them of what happened. ‘While this process is ongoing we are unable to say more at this point. ‘However, I can say that after being made aware of the facts that Roy has both my full support and the full support of the FAI and John Delaney (FAI chief executive).’ Although Ireland officials - and now their manager - have moved to back their man, it is hardly ideal preparation for Friday’s crunch Euro 2016 qualifier against Scotland in Glasgow. O’Neill added: ‘We are now focused - as we have been all week - on the game in hand and won’t be saying anything more about this issue.’ The FAI were quick to refute the claims on Wednesday, stating that reports surrounding a bust-up were ‘inaccurate’ and revealed that Keane himself had notified the Gardai of the incident. According to well-placed sources in the Ireland camp, the incident was blown out of proportion and contrary to social media rumours, no players were involved. Gardai confirmed they had attended, but that no arrest or complaint had been made. The Ireland squad are staying at the luxury four star hotel before flying to Scotland on Thursday . The luxury Links hotel features a golf course as well as a range of top quality features . It is understood that CCTV cameras were operating in the area of the hotel in which the exchange took place. In a statement released late on Wednesday night, the FAI said: ‘Following inaccurate media reports which refer to an incident involving a member of the public this evening at the Republic of Ireland team hotel, we wish to clarify that Roy Keane called the Gardai following the incident.’ O'Neill will be without James McCarthy for the trip to Scotland as they press ahead in a quest to reach France in two years' time. The Republic currently sit joint top of Group D along with Poland after taking seven of the first nine points on offer, the last of them from a creditable 1-1 draw with world champions Germany in Gelsenkirchen last month.

"Journalist Sophie Woolley who, after being profoundly deaf for several years, regained her hearing thanks to a cochlear implant . My hands were shaking as I dialled my husband's number. It had, after all, been almost ten years since I'd last heard Tom's voice. 'Hello Sophie,' he said, sounding just as he had the first time we met, at a party in 2000. We both started to laugh with joy, so loudly that I nearly missed hearing him say: 'I love you.' Those words usually passed between us in sign language. I had been profoundly deaf for several years, and we had come to rely on signing to communicate. Tom's voice wasn't the only sound I'd missed desperately in that time. I missed hearing my dad play his violin, the splashing of water in a shower, even hearing myself sing. I could hear when I was born but began to go deaf in my teens. As I approached my 40th birthday last summer, I was somewhere between profoundly and totally deaf. But the flick of a techno-switch on the cochlear implant fitted in my skull finally transported me back to a lost world; a place where cats purred, sirens screeched and pebbles clinked on the beach. Although my deafness is genetic and runs through generations of my family, in my 20s I remained in denial. I had a degree, friends, boyfriends and a career as a journalist, scriptwriter and actress. Audiology tests were an advance warning but I refused hearing aids; I just wanted someone to turn up the volume. By my late 20s, denial had turned to despair. Like all deafened people I would bluff when I couldn't hear and swiftly change the subject of conversations I couldn't follow. As a journalist, I was winging my way through interviews with a tape recorder customised for my failing ears. At night I performed my own material in nightclubs, and at literary events that were noisy I reckoned no one else could hear much either. But I sensed impending doom and clung to friends, fearful that soon I'd  be unable to hear them. Romance was hard, too. You can't go on a casual date when small talk is impossible. When I met Tom, an engineer, through friends, he had to learn sign language to get to know me. Even in the early days when we still communicated verbally, whispered sweet nothings were tricky. Sophie said: 'My implant bleeped and squeaked as it began finding the right frequencies, but I didn't care. I was overawed' I hated weddings because I was surrounded by people I loved but couldn't understand. So when it came to my own wedding, we 'eloped' to a register office in East London. We've left it a bit late to have children. If we ever do, there is a 50-50 chance our son or daughter will go deaf when they grow up. But at least they will have the chance to hear again, thanks to cochlear implants. It was around the time our relationship became serious that I stopped being able to use a phone. Hearing aids saved me for a while, making the most of the dwindling sound I could pick up, but I had to lip-read in tandem with them, which I found crushingly exhausting. By 2008 I was in shock, feeling the last remnants of my hearing self slipping away. Even with hearing aids, the only sounds I could discern were muffled, as if I were under water. Inside my head was a cacophony of small noises from tinnitus, the result of my brain making up sounds of its own. It is a common misunderstanding that deaf people live in silence. About dating when deaf Sophie said: 'Romance was hard, too. You can't go on a casual date when small talk is impossible' I often felt isolated and moody, and focused on my career. I toured with my plays, wrote scripts, even founded a theatre company. I had radio plays broadcast and played Gabby in the Channel 4 series Cast Offs. It was in 2011 that my audiologist suggested I might be eligible for a cochlear implant. This would mean inserting electrodes into my cochlea - part of the inner ear - to send signals to my brain, enabling me to hear again. I would have a small headpiece and a processor over my ear, the receiver a tiny computer set into my skull. But there was a risk: if the implant failed, it would destroy any tiny bit of hearing I had left. The biggest terror, however, was daring to hope. I had the 90-minute operation in July this year. I had to wait 30 days before the implant could be switched on to give the wound time to heal and the device a chance to settle in. Tom was working on the day I had to go back to hospital, so my mum and sister came with me. They are both deaf and don't have implants. A doctor once told my mum she should get sterilised to avoid passing on the deaf gene. Sophie's mother Maggie, who also went deaf as a teenager . Because we grow up hearing and then go deaf, my family are proud of both parts of ourselves. None of us expected to hear again, so what has happened to me in the past month has been an incredible journey for us all. When the doctor turned on the implant, I felt like a radio being tuned. At first all I could hear were computer noises. Then I heard my own voice, followed by my mother's; the sound of my childhood. 'I was so excited at the idea of being an ordinary wife on the phone to her husband, I thought I might burst with joy' My implant bleeped and squeaked as it began finding the right frequencies, but I didn't care. I was overawed. Tom had taken two weeks off to care for me after surgery but then had to go away for work. As soon as I left the hospital after my switch-on, I called him. I was so excited at the idea of being an ordinary wife on the phone to her husband, I thought I might burst with joy. Those first few days were far from perfect. People's voices veered from Minnie Mouse to Barry White, with special effects by The Clangers. But I gorged myself on sound: everything from Elgar's Cello Concerto In E Minor to synthesiser music. It was everyday sounds that made the most difference. I could telephone my friends. I could hear the radio, tannoy announcements, the doorbell ringing, my own footsteps. After just ten days I was at the stage most people reach at six weeks, and was delighted when an audiology test gave me slightly below-normal hearing. I thanked my specialist, then burst into tears. In the pyramid of human need, communication comes first and music is a luxury, but I had rediscovered both and it has been life-changing. In the three weeks since then, my sense of reawakening has grown exponentially. I've been stunned at how chatty people are. I love talking to strangers. I have music on my iPod - friends have given me their playlists from the past decade or more, so I can catch up. People say things as they walk away, with their backs turned - and I hear. Life feels faster, warmer, more connected. People ask me if a cochlear implant is a cure. It's not. When I take my headset off at night, I return to total deafness. In fact, my brain has stopped making noise for itself so  my quiet is quieter than it has ever been - for which I am  very grateful. When I was deaf, I used to have dreams in which I could hear. Now, if I have such a dream tonight, I will wake tomorrow knowing that it has come true.","Sophie Woolley, 40, was born with hearing but began losing it in her teens .

"Iceland has reopened the airspace above its largest volcano after scientists downgraded its threat to 'orange'. The directive came after the country's Met Office today issued a 'red alert' early this morning after the Bardarbunga volcano erupted last night. Even though no volcanic ash was detected, authorities took the unusual step of banning all flights over the volcano in a move that echoed the Eyjafjallajokull ash cloud disaster which brought European air travel to a standstill for six days in 2010.

Rumbling: The rumblings at Iceland's largest volcano system, which is covered by a several hundred meters thick glacier, have raised worries of an eruption that could spell trouble for air travel . The eruption just after midnight took place in a lava field not covered by ice. The risk of an ash cloud is highest in case of a sub-glacial eruption. 'The Icelandic Met Office has raised the aviation colourcode over the eruption site to red and the Icelandic Air Traffic Control has closed down the airspace from the earth up to 18000 feet,' Iceland's National Crisis Coordination Centre said. Volatile: Bardarbunga is located under Iceland’s largest glacier and it has been rocked by thousands of earthquakes for nearly two weeks.= . 'No volcanic ash has been detected with the radar system at the moment....Seismic eruption tremor is low indicating effusive eruption without significant explosive activity. Icelandic Met Office spokesman Kristin Gudmundsdottir said activity at the fissure seemed to be unchanged in the morning hours after decreasing two hours after the eruption started. The red warning code indicates that an eruption is imminent or underway, with a risk of ash. There are fears that an eruption could disrupt air travel over Europe, and aviation authorities are keeping a watchful eye on the situation. However, Iceland’s meteorological office says there is no evidence that a large eruption is underway. Bardarbunga is located under Iceland’s largest glacier and it has been rocked by thousands of earthquakes for nearly two weeks. Icelandic Coast Guard officers fly over the Holuhraun lava field north of the Vatnajokull glacier to detect the latest volcanic activities earlier today . More than 400 earthquakes were detected between midnight and 6am yesterday. The strongest one yet occurred on Tuesday morning with a magnitude of 5.7. While airlines remain on alert and travellers nervously book flights, UK-based travel company Discover the World has received plenty of its interest in its ‘volcano hotline’. The tour operator is planning to fly customers to the eruption site – if there is one – and almost 200 people have signed up over the last week. In 2010, Discover the World took tourists to the Fimmvorduhals eruption in south-western Iceland. That eruption occurred about a month before the Eyjafjallajokull volcano spewed a massive cloud of ash that shut down much of Europe’s airspace for six days, causing widespread travel chaos during the crisis.

"The first Neolithic-style burial chamber built in Britain for 5,000 years is set to open this weekend - and 45 customers have already paid for their ashes to be stored there. With space initially for 2,400 ‘customers’, people can reserve a slot for £1,000 ($1,630) each. The tomb, designed by farmer Tim Daw, has been positioned to let the midwinter sunrise shine right down the length of the chamber where people’s ashes will be placed in urns set into the walls. Farmer Tim Daw is preparing to open his neolithic-style tomb (shown). The chamber is located near the Wiltshire town of All Cannings. People can buy a space in the tomb to have their ashes stored after their death for £1,000 ($1,630) The burial chamber sees an official opening reception party on Saturday morning on farmland outside the Wiltshire village of All Cannings, where it is based. Mr Daw and his team began work in January to build the tomb from thousands of tons of rock, covered by grass. And Mr Daw, who won planning permission last year, said: 'To see it finished after all the hard work - it’s turned out far better than expected.' He’s also a steward at Stonehenge a few miles away and says the tomb is the perfect place for people who want to put the urns of their loved ones in a non-religious place. He said: 'I’ve been amazed at the response - it’s a different way to remember someone, and the place is modern and ancient at the same time.' Initially he can store the cremated remains of 2,400 people in 250 niches inside four chambers, though the eventual plan is 350 niches in seven chambers. Entire families can reserve their own ‘room’ in the tomb, which has no religious links although it’s already attracting pagan worshippers, said Tim, a self-confessed atheist. 'A lot of its appeal is down to the stonemason coming up with the idea of how to build it and insisting on doing it the proper way, using real traditional materials and methods. That’s paying off in spades, with the quality of it and the feel of the place. 'For some of it, the stone has almost told us how to do it. At the entrance, when they fitted together it just felt right and it looks right.' Wiltshire is strewn with Neolithic burial mounds, or barrows, dating back to the new stone age period, beginning about 10,200 BC and ending between 4,500 and 2,000 BC. They were constructed using vast sarsen stones or wooden posts and then covered with mud, soil and grass. Silbury Hill, pictured, dates back to the Neolithic period but mystery still surrounds its original purpose . West Kennet Long Barrow, six miles from Daw's barrow at All Cannings, is one of the largest, measuring 100 metres (330 feet) long. Excavations suggest work began on the tomb, which has five sarsen stone chambers, in 3,600 BC - some 400 years before Stonehenge was begun. East Kennet Long Barrow is the largest in Britain, a wedge-shaped burial chamber measuring 106 metres (348 feet) long. It is believed to have been open for several centuries before being sealed up. Lanhill Long Barrow, near Chippenham, is a late Neolithic long barrow which was found to contain the remains of several people from the same family, ranging in age from 12 months to 60 years. Beckhampton Long Barrow, near Avebury, is one of the oldest known barrows in the country, dating back to around 3,200 BC. Its two ends have been ploughed away and destroyed, but the remains of one of the Beaker folk, migrants into Britain in 2,500 BC who were notable for the beaker shape of their pottery, have been found in the barrow. Silbury Hill, a vast chalk mound 16 miles (26 kilometres) from Stonehenge, is not strictly a barrow but is a man-made mound from the same, Neolithic period and can be seen from many of the barrows that post-date it. Despite various attempts to excavate it over the years, and despite a common assumption over the years that it must be a burial mound, its purpose is still a mystery. source: Wiltshire Web . The burial chamber sees an offical opening reception party on Saturday morning on farmland outside the Wiltshire village of All Cannings, where it is based. Mr Daw and his team began work in January to build the tomb from thousands of tons of rock, covered by grass . It has also been positioned so the midwinter sunrise shines down the length of the chamber. 'I’ve been amazed at the response - it’s a different way to remember someone, and the place is modern and ancient at the same time,' said Daw (pictured) Tim, who runs a 220-acre farm, has always had a passion for archaeology and said the idea came out of a ‘classic pub conversation’. 'We were saying wouldn’t it be nice to get buried in a long barrow and then I was walking round the farm one winter’s morning and it was misty, very quiet and the sun was just rising, and I thought ""I wouldn’t mind spending eternity here."" 'I thought ""You could put a long barrow here with the winter sun coming in"". The idea all came together very quickly. 'People have bought niches right from before we had even broken the ground. Someone from California has bought a niche, and she’s very welcome. 'I’d love to have this as a meeting place, as so much of the Neolithic was about in Wiltshire, with people from all areas coming together.' Initially  the cremated remains of 2,400 people can be stored in 250 niches inside four chambers, though the eventual plan is 350 niches in seven chambers. Entire families can reserve their own ‘room’ in the tomb, which has no religious links although it’s already attracting pagan worshippers, said Tim, a self-confessed atheist . Stonemason Geraint Davies described it as ‘not your usual job and a once in a lifetime opportunity’. He said: 'I quite like archaeology. It’s fascinating to go to Stonehenge and see how they managed to construct that. 'I’m trying to build it in a way the Neolithic people could have done it in their time. 'It’s strange really. We haven’t built a long barrow for 5,000 years, but now we’ve had another enquiry for one. 'They want a burial chamber built in central London to hold some art. 'They’re like buses. You don’t get one for 5,000 years and then all of a sudden two come at once.' Stonemason Geraint Davies described it as ‘not your usual job and a once in a lifetime opportunity’. He said: 'I quite like archaeology. It’s fascinating to go to Stonehenge and see how they managed to construct that. I’m trying to build it in a way the Neolithic people could have done it in their time' One person who’s signed up is Simon Banton, 49, of Figheldean, Wilts, who said: 'I’m interested in the alignment of ancient monuments. 'What appeals to me about having my remains in this long barrow is the permanence of the structure and the landscape. 'This long barrow is going to baffle archaeologists for ever.' The winter solstice will shine down the length of the inernal passageway, with the front of the barrow being made from one-tonne Sarsen stones, the same material used at Stonehenge and the Avebury stone circle near Pewsey, Wilts. Retired archaeologist David Field, from Yatesbury, near Calne, who worked on the repair of the ancient and mysterious Silbury Hill and has visited most of the country’s long barrows, said: 'The facade looks very impressive and the chambers are very good. 'It’s not a direct copy of anything Neolithic and I think that’s quite deliberate. It’s distinctive and modern.'","Farmer Tim Daw is preparing to open his Neolithic-style tomb .

"Thousands of secondary school children could be taught maths and science by teachers with no training in the subjects because of a recruitment crisis, an academic has warned. Up to 30 per cent of places on postgraduate certificate in education maths courses due to start in September have not been filled. Physics has also suffered a significant shortfall, along with modern foreign languages and English. Numbers of applicants for teacher training in maths are down 709 on last year and in physics by 386 (file picture) The lack of candidates is being blamed on growing confidence elsewhere in the jobs market and a squeeze on teachers’ pay. It means more than 100,000 pupils could have classes with teachers who are not trained in the subject. Numbers of applicants for maths are down 709 on last year and in physics by 386. Both are ‘national strategic priorities’ at A-level according to Education Secretary Michael Gove. Design technology has shed 345 applicants and English 343, although the latter had a surplus last year. Professor John Howson, of Oxford Brookes’ University, said the Government got ‘complacent after the recession’ as secondary school rolls fell and a ‘high spot’ of teacher retirements eased. The lack of candidates is being blamed on growing confidence elsewhere in the jobs market and a squeeze on teachers' pay (file picture) He said although lots of people wanted to study teaching at that point, due to job shortages elsewhere, ‘this was never going to last’. Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders said there were ‘big gaps in recruitment’ particularly in science, technology, engineering and maths. A Department for Education spokesman said there was no teacher shortage, adding: ‘This is scaremongering and based on incomplete evidence.’","Up to 30 per cent of places on PGCE maths courses have not been filled .

"Wayne Rooney will only be truly appreciated by England fans and pundits when he is gone, according to Leighton Baines. Rooney, at 29, is set to win his 100th cap against Slovenia on Saturday and is six goals shy of Sir Bobby Charlton’s England goalscoring record of 49. But he has come in for criticism of his form at various points in his career, particularly at major tournaments. Wayne Rooney will only be truly appreciated as an England player once he retires, claims Leighton Baines . Baines (right) and Frank Lampard celebrate Wayne Rooney's goal against San Marino in 2013 . Baines, however, said the pressure placed on Rooney’s shoulders was greater than any of his international team-mates and that he frequently provided the goods. 'Sometimes it’s not until later on that people get the credit they deserve,’ said Baines. 'If Wayne can keep fit, keep playing, he’s going to break more records. 'He has been at the forefront of everything England have done since his involvement in the squads and has carried a lot of pressure. Everyone will look back when he’s finished and has broken all the records and will acknowledge he has been one of the all-time greats for England. 'It will be great to see Wayne get 100 caps, thoroughly well deserved. He’s got a really good goal-scoring record and has scored some really important goals down the years for England.

He’s earned that right to be leading the team. He’s a leader amongst the squad.’ Baines also gave his support to Roy Hodgson being handed a contract extension.

"The number of mentally-ill patients killed by euthanasia in Holland has trebled in the space of a year, new figures have revealed. In 2013, a total of 42 people with ‘severe psychiatric problems’ were killed by lethal injection compared to 14 in 2012 and 13 in 2011. The latest official figures also revealed a 15 per cent surge in the number of euthanasia deaths from 4,188 cases in 2012 to 4,829 cases last year. Scroll down for video . Euthanasia cases in Holland have risen by 15 per cent in the last year, which included people with 'severe psychiatric problems' as well as terminally ill patients (file picture) The incremental rise is consistent with a 13 per cent increase in 2012, an 18 per cent rise in 2011, 19 per cent in 2010 and 13 per cent in 2009. The rise is also likely to confirm the fears of Dutch regulator Theo Boer who told the Daily Mail that he expected to see euthanasia cases smash the 6,000 barrier in 2014. Overall, deaths by euthanasia, which officially account for three per cent of all deaths in the Netherlands, have increased by 151 per cent in just seven years. Most cases - some 3,600 people – involved cancer sufferers but there were also 97 people who died at the hands of their doctors because they were suffering from dementia, the figures show. The figures, however, do not include cases of so-called terminal sedation, where patients are given a cocktail of sedatives and narcotics before food and fluids are withdrawn. Studies suggest that if such deaths were added to the figure then euthanasia would account for one in eight – about 12.3 per cent – of all deaths in the Netherlands. Dr Peter Saunders of the Christian Medical Fellowship said the Dutch experiment proved that doctor-assisted death was impossible to effectively regulate. Dutch regulator Theo Boer said that he expected to see euthanasia cases smash the 6,000 barrier in 2014 in Holland . ‘Euthanasia in the Netherlands is way out of control,’ he said. ‘The House of Lords calculated in 2005 that with a Dutch-type law in Britain we would be seeing over 13,000 cases of euthanasia per year,’ he continued. ‘On the basis of how Dutch euthanasia deaths have risen since this may prove to be a gross underestimate. ‘What we are seeing in the Netherlands is “incremental extension”, the steady intentional escalation of numbers with a gradual widening of the categories of patients to be included.’ He said there was a similar pattern of increasing numbers of assisted suicide and euthanasia in the US state of Oregon, Switzerland, and Belgium. Dr Saunders said: ‘The lessons are clear. Once you relax the law on euthanasia or assisted suicide steady extension will follow as night follows day.’ He added: ‘Britain needs to take warning as debate on the Falconer bill continues.’ Lord Falconer’s Assisted Dying Bill received its Second Reading in July and it will reach committee stage in November after Parliament reconvenes. Supporters, such as campaigners Dignity in Dying, insist that the Falconer Bill is based on a US model of assisted suicide ‘which has been working safely for over 17 years and has never been extended beyond the criteria of terminal illness’. But Professor Boer, who has reviewed 4,000 cases of euthanasia in his role as a regulator, told Parliament in the summer: ‘Don’t go there.’ Once a firm advocate of euthanasia, he said that he now the Dutch were ‘terribly wrong’ to think they could control it. Writing in the Daily Mail, he said his country has witnessed an ‘explosive increase’ in the numbers of euthanasia deaths since 2007 and that he expected the number of such deaths this year to hit 6,000. He was also gravely concerned at the extension of killing to new classes of people, including the demented and the depressed. ‘Some slopes truly are slippery,’ he said. Doctors in neighbouring Belgium, which this year legalised euthanasia for children, are now killing an average of five people every day by euthanasia, according to latest figures, with a 27 per cent surge in the number of euthanasia deaths in the last year alone. In one of the most shocking cases, a Brussels man last week described how he arranged the double euthanasia of his octogenarian parents who wanted to die because they were afraid of loneliness. It has also emerged that a Dutch woman in her 80s was killed by her doctors just because she did not want to live in a care home. The case is the first to be referred to Dutch prosecutors by regulators since euthanasia was legalised in Holland 12 years ago. Euthanasia is permitted in cases where there is unbearable suffering, increasingly interpreted to mean mental anguish.","42 people with mental illnesses killed by lethal injection in Holland last year .

"Reforms: Michael Gove announced changes to GCSE exams aiming to put the focus back on academic rigour and one-off exams . The biggest shake-up in school exams for a generation will see discredited GCSEs scrapped  and replaced with English  Baccalaureate Certificates. A return to end-of-course exams in traditional academic subjects and the slashing of coursework and resits will ‘restore rigour’ to the education system, Michael Gove said yesterday. The Education Secretary also announced tough core EBC courses which will be taught from 2015, with the first exams sat two years later. Students will be awarded a full English Baccalaureate if they succeed in six core subjects: English, maths, two sciences – from physics, biology and chemistry – a language and geography or history. The GCSE brand could be scrapped altogether in 2016 to make a clean break with a system first introduced in 1988. A single exam board will preside over each subject, bringing an end to competition which Mr Gove said had encouraged a ‘corrupt effort to massage up pass rates’. Announcing the reforms in the Commons, he said: ‘It is time for the race to the bottom to end. It is time to tackle grade inflation and dumbing down. It is time to raise aspirations.’ ‘After years of drift, decline and dumbing down, at last we are reforming our examination system to compete with the world’s best.’ The aim of Mr Gove’s reforms is to restore O-level-style rigour in a bid to halt the nation’s slide down the international schools league tables. However his ambition to fully replicate the O-level system, in which only the brightest sat the toughest exam, has been shelved following opposition from Nick Clegg. The Deputy Prime Minister’s . intervention also delayed the reforms by a year, raising fears Labour . could try to save GCSEs if the party wins the next election. But . education sources last night said the reforms were ‘unstoppable’. Mr Gove also revealed less able pupils would be offered the chance to take the new EBC exams at 17 or 18 instead of 16. Catch up: The new exams are more rigorous and top grades will only go to the brightest children in an attempt to help English schools catch up with other countries as we trail in school standards . He and Mr Clegg put on a show of unity . yesterday with a joint article in which they launched a pre-emptive . attack on teaching unions and the Labour Left. They said: ‘Together we can overcome . those forces that have held our children back – the entrenched . establishment voices who have become the enemies of promise.’ The proposals will see hundreds of . thousands of 11-year-olds, who started secondary school this  term, . becoming the new ‘guinea pigs’ of the education system. Exam boards have . previously been accused of ‘dumbing down’  GCSEs to attract the . multi-million pound business from secondary schools. But under the reforms, just one will . be selected by Ofqual to offer qualifications in each subject in a bid . to prevent the ‘race to the bottom’. Nick Gibb, a schools minister until this month's reshuffle, insisted the plans couldn't be reversed even if Labour won the next general election . GCSEs in other subjects are also being toughened up and are unlikely to keep the ‘GCSE’ title. Currently, many GCSEs have two tiers so pupils can either be entered for the foundation level – the simpler of the two and the maximum grade achievable is a C – or the higher level, where students can get up to an A*. Under the shake-up, the foundation and higher level will be scrapped in the EBC subjects, meaning there will be no cap on how well pupils can achieve. A consultation document by the Department for Education suggests exam boards come up with ‘new and different grading structures’. They will be expected to ‘differentiate’ between top achievers and provide a ‘statement of achievement’ for those who are not entered for EBCs. The Government’s ‘preferred approach’ is to remove controlled assessment – or coursework done under exam conditions – from all six English Baccalaureate subjects. Other reforms including scrapping bite-sized modules and resits. The overhaul is expected to result in fewer top achievers. This summer, pupils passed 22.4 per cent of GCSEs at A or A*. Stephen Twigg MP, Labour’s education spokesman, claimed the changes were ‘totally out of date’ and could be a ‘Trojan horse’ for the introduction of a two-tier system in the future. Teaching unions also condemned the change.  Martin Johnson, of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: ‘O-levels were abolished 25 years ago for a very good reason: they just tested memory and essay writing, which are not crucial  skills for the majority of jobs or  life today.’ But business welcomed the move. Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: ‘Business leaders want a stronger curriculum and more rigorous exams. These measures are welcome progress towards delivering that.’ GCSEs Tens of thousands of pupils can bump up grades by re-sitting parts of the GCSE exams until they get a pass.EBaccs Partial resits will end.

"A schoolboy with learning difficulties was hit with a 50,000-volt Taser by police at a special school. Officers were called to Chelfham Senior School near Plymouth, a special needs school owned by the exclusive Priory Group following an alleged assault on a teacher in a 'scuffle' with pupils. A 15-year-old was shot with the electric stun gun after several police units arrived at the school grounds to find three boys allegedly holding two knives. Tasers: Armed officers threatened, targeted or discharged the 50,000-volt weapons against youngsters more than 320 times a year - an 11-fold increase from first year they were cleared for use against under-18s . Police confirmed last night that no officers were injured. The male teacher in his late 40s suffered chest and facial injuries, which were not thought to be knife related. The victim was treated at the scene by paramedics before being taken to Derriford Hospital. Campaigners reacted with fury yesterday, saying the use of Taser on a vulnerable boy with a complex learning difficulty flouts the guidelines and may have been excessive. The incident at the school, which specialises in children with learning difficulties including behavioural, emotional and social difficulties and autism, happened at 9.20pm on December 1, but police did not release any details at the time. The day and residential school for boys and girls aged seven to 19 in the village of Bere Alston in the Devon countryside, is owned by the Priory Group, a private company known for its addiction clinics favoured by celebrities. Yesterday Sophie Khan, a solicitor-advocate and legal director at Police Action Centre called for an inquiry. She said: 'The use of a Taser on this occasion has to be called into question. The police action may have been excessive. 'The use on children is only allowed if it is the only feasible method of restraining the child. 'It's only there if there are no other alternatives to restrain the child. 'Often officers can say they weren't aware of behaviour issues, but in this case they must have been aware. 'Using a Taser on someone suffering some kind of behavioural difficulty or disability is something the policy or guidance doesn't allow.' Yesterday Devon and Cornwall Police refused to comment on the case. Fury: Campaigners reacted with fury yesterday, saying the use of Taser on a vulnerable boy with a complex learning difficulty flouts the guidelines and may have been excessive . The three boys involved, two 14-year-olds and the 15-year-old have since been charged with affray. The shocking incident comes after new figures revealed that Tasers are being used by police against children as young as 11 almost every day. Armed officers threatened, targeted or discharged the 50,000-volt weapons against youngsters more than 320 times a year - an 11-fold increase from the first year they were cleared for use against under-18s in 2007. In the first year of officers being cleared to Taser children, they were used just 29 times in England. By 2011 - the latest year that figures are available - the total stood at 323. It was not specified whether the guns were fired, or whether officers aimed them at children. Experts say that even targeting a person using the weapon's laser red dot is threatening. There have been a number of alarming cases involving the US-made weapons. In July, Jordan Begley, 23, who had a suspected heart condition, died after being Tasered by police in Manchester. Devon and Cornwall Police are being investigated by the police watchdog after Andrew Pimlott, 32, died from burns when he was Tasered after dousing himself in fuel in March this year. Last October, blind Colin Farmer, 63, was Tasered in Chorley, Lancashire, when an officer mistook his white stick for a sword. Eight other people have died after being Tasered since the weapons were introduced a decade ago. The Police Federation wants all officers to have a Taser. Yesterday a spokesperson for the school said: 'People responded to an isolated incident on the school grounds and as legal proceedings are ongoing it would be inappropriate to comment further.' The three boys will appear at Plymouth Magistrates' Court on December 20.

"Controversial boxer Adrien Broner has issued a grovelling apology to rapper Jay-Z and singer Rihanna after he launched a scathing attack on the pair last week. Jay-Z, real name Shawn Corey Carter, and his management company Roc Nation Sports, offered Broner a contract worth $8million (£5.2m) a year for five years  but the fighter turned it down after being 'offended' by the deal. In a stunning statement on Facebook, Broner claimed that Jay-Z could 's*** his d***', before continuing his attack during an interview with TMZ Sports. Adrien Broner has apologised after his astonishing rant at Jay-Z and Rihanna after a contract offer . Broner was offered £5.2m a year for five years from Jay-Z's company Roc Nation Sports, but refused it . When asked if he had considered accepting the offer to enable him to get 'one degree closer' to singer Rihanna - who is also signed to Jay-Z's label - Broner claimed: 'F*** Rihanna, she's only good for p***y.' But the boxer, who has a record of 29 wins to one loss, has since backtracked on his claims, apologising to both parties in a second interview with TMZ. 'I've gotta address something because I'm getting a lot of feedback from this interview I did with TMZ,' Broner said. 'I was going to let it ride out and say, ""Forget the haters"", but my big homie called me, somebody that I respect, and he made me understand why I was wrong.

'You never invite another man to another man's private parts. That's just ridiculous. 'I was caught up in the moment and I want to apologise to Jay for that. I'm a man at the end of the day. I'm wrong and I can admit when I'm wrong. 'I never should have said ""Forget Rihanna."" I said it in a more explicit way. I'm wrong, I'm sorry. If Jay wants to talk to me, you can get in touch with me and we can talk about it.'","Jay-Z offered Adrien Broner a contract worth £5.2m a year for five years .

"Shawn Corey Carter: rapper, record producer, businessman – and boxing promoter. The man more commonly known as Jay Z will be front and centre tonight as he hosts his first show at the Madison Square Garden Theatre in New York. He will be joined at ringside by his wife Beyonce and pop star Rihanna while the voice of boxing, Michael Buffer, will announce the fights. VIDEO Scroll down to see the Dusty Hernandez-Harrison and Tommy Rainone weigh-in . Jay Z will be joined by his wife Beyonce at Madison Square Garden for his first boxing show . Jay Z married superstar Beyonce in 2008 and they are seen pictured here in Thailand . Headlining the show will be 20-year-old Dusty Hernandez-Harrison, an unbeaten but largely untested welterweight in his 25th contest. And just hours before his first show, world super middleweight champion Andre Ward announced he had joined Jay Z's company. Ward has been out of action for 14 months but tweeted: 'It's official! Happy to be part of the Roc Nation family.' World super middleweight champion Andre Ward (pictured left with Jay Z) has joined the rapper's company . But beyond the glamour and razzmatazz that will accompany the nine-fight card lies the story of a man desperate to make his mark in the sport of boxing. Born and raised in New York, Jay Z, now 45, rose from a housing project in Brooklyn to amass a fortune of $520million (£344m). Along the way he sold one hundred million records, won nine Grammy Awards and is considered one of the greatest rappers of all time. His business interests include urban clothing company Rocawear, sports bar 40/40 Club in New York and independent record label Block Starz Music. He has bought and sold stakes in the Barclays Centre and the Brooklyn Nets basketball team and in 2013 launched sports agency Roc Nation Sports which is dedicated to 'elevating athletes’ career on a global scale both on and off the field'. Athletes currently signed include basketball player Kevin Durant, baseball’s CC Sabathia and American footballers Geno Smith and Victor Cruz. But it is in boxing that he has attempted to make the biggest splash, although he has thus far encountered his fair share of barriers. Jay Z's first boxing show will be headlined by Dusty Hernandez-Harrison and Tommy Rainone . Madison Square Garden has played host to its fair share of iconic fights over the years . Eighteen months after forming the company, Jay Z appointed David Itskowitch as Roc Nation Sports' chief operating officer. Itskowitch held the same position at Oscar de la Hoya's Golden Boy until last summer and promised to make an 'immediate and dramatic impact on the sport'. He did just that the very next day, travelling to Puerto Rica with a cheque for $1,904,840 to bid for a middleweight world title fight between champion Peter Quillin and Matt Korobov. Roc Nation Sports won the purse bid, offering $700,000 more than the next highest bid from Golden Boy. But Quillin never did fight Korobov, instead opting to vacate his title and wave goodbye to a $1.4m pay day. The answer to the obvious question of 'why' lies in a bitter feud between Jay Z and the mysterious figure of Al-Haymon, boxing manager to the likes of Floyd Mayweather Jnr and Amir Khan. Haymon, who does not give interviews, also has a background in music, promoting concerts involving the likes of M.C. Hammer, Mary J Blige and Whitney Houston. From RnB to rap and hip hop, Haymon put on 500 shows in 1991 and by 2000 had made the move into boxing. He is believed to have crossed paths with Jay Z during his time in the music industry but was also named in a law suit filed by Beyonce’s father in 2011. Peter Quillin (left) vacated his title rather than fight on a show promoted by Roc Nation Sports . Jay Z made an offer to heavyweight knockout artist Deontay Wilder (left) but the deal went unsigned . Keith Thurman (right) turned down a $6m, multi-fight offer from Roc Nation Sports . As well as Mayweather, Haymon can count former world champions Shawn Porter and Adrien Broner, welterweight prospect Keith Thurman and heavyweight knockout sensation Deontay Wilder among his clients. Roc Nation Sports reportedly offered Wilder $2m for his upcoming fight with WBC belt holder Bermane Stiverne as part of a five-fight deal, only to remove the offer from the table after receiving no response. Thurman, meanwhile, rejected a multi-fight deal worth $6m, telling ESPN: 'Jay Z's company is a young company. I haven't seen them make guys money yet in boxing. 'I want to see [Jay Z] do something with another fighter before I follow. I don't want to fly on the first airplane.' That first plane will now take off tonight with a star name and earlier this week, Roc Nation Sports announced a merger with Gary Shaw Productions. Shaw’s roster includes heavyweight Bryant Jennings who could fight Wladimir Klitschko in New York in April and former world champions Daniel Geale and Jhonatan Romero. Al Haymon aside, Jay Z's bold arrival on the boxing scene has been well received. Veteran promoter Bob Arum, who represents Manny Pacquiao, backed him to be a ‘great success’ while De La Hoya welcomed ‘Jay Z and Roc Nation to the wonderful sport of boxing’. 50 Cent (left) joined forces with Floyd Mayweather Jnr (right) in 2012 but their relationship hit rock bottom . Jay Z is not the first musician to dabble in boxing. Curtis Jackson, aka 50 Cent, formed The Money Team (TMT) with Mayweather in 2012 but the relationship lasted just a few months. He now promotes through his own company, SMS Promotions, but has only a handful of fighters signed, chiefly Cuban lightweight Yuriorkis Gamboa. Jackson's relationship with Mayweather is now seemingly beyond repair after an unsavoury exchange last year when the rapper claimed his former business partner could not read and insists he is owed $2m. In his memoir, Decoded, Jay Z wrote: ‘Boxing is a glorious sport to watch and boxers are incredible, heroic athletes, but it's also, to be honest, a stupid game to play. Even the winners can end up with crippling brain damage. 'But you learn something special from playing the most difficult games, the games where winning is close to impossible and losing is catastrophic.' It’s too early to tell whether the man who once said he could sell water to a well will be one of boxing’s winners, but where better to start than the place dreams are made of?","Jay Z will promote his first boxing show in New York tonight .

Nathanial Clyne rescued his side with an equaliser that leaves Southampton in second place . “But we deserved our goal and we had the patience in the second half. We knew they would defend and keep their organisation. “It was late but well deserved. We played more football than they did. Every game in the Premier League is difficult and they were missing some key players and in a difficult situation and maybe that’s more dangerous than normal. “After being 1-0 down it was more difficult but we got a point and for confidence it was important.”","Southampton were held to 1-1 draw with Aston Villa in the Premier League .

"Hundreds of sheep have been painted with a bizarre 'smiley face' symbol in fields across the country. The strange image has sparked debate on social networking sites after it was first reported on 20 animals in a field in Melton Mowbray, in Leicestershire. There have since been sightings in a further five fields across the UK, including Perthshire in Scotland, and 500 miles south in Exeter, Devon. Not impressed: Hundreds of sheep have been branded with the mysterious 'smiley face' symbol at sites up and down the country, including these unimpressed-looking sheep in Exeter . Early sighting: These sheep in Melton Mowbray were among the first to be spotted. There are now more than 100 sheep believed to have been marked in this way . Smile for the camera: The strange markings have been spotted on sheep hundreds of miles apart, including in Devon and Scotland . And people have taken to Twitter to share pictures of the unexplained phenomenon, using the hashtag #creepysheep. Many are questioning how the eerie symbol came to be etched on the animals - with some talking of 'supernatural powers' and 'UFOs'. Even farmers appear baffled, with one saying: 'It is like crop circles - but on sheep.' The symbol appears to have been painted on both sides of randomly chosen animals at each of the affected farms. It looks like a smiley face, with two spiralling eyes and a long, connecting, mouth. Unexplained: These branded sheep in Middlesborough appear a little startled as they have their picture taken . Branded: The symbol appears to have been painted on both sides of randomly chosen animals at each of the affected farms . More than 100 sheep are thought to have been targeted in total.

"So who is Michael J Garcia, FIFA’s independent ethics investigator, and the man who has effectively thrown a grenade into the World Cup bidding process? The American lawyer is a partner for a top law firm, Kirkland’s, based in New York and Washington. Before joining the company he led 250 lawyers as US attorney for the southern district of New York . During that time, he personally prosecuted a number of high-profile cases, including the 1993 terrorist bombing of the World Trade Centre and the 1998 bombing of American embassies in East Africa. Michael J Garcia (left), standing with Hans-Joachim Eckert, was appointed by Sepp Blatter in 2012 to investigate allegations of corruption in world football . For his work on these cases, Garcia was twice awarded the Department of Justice's Exceptional Service Award, the Department's highest honour, as well as the Distinguished Service Award. Between 2005 and 2008 he was US attorney. Again his focus was on high-profile insider trading, public corruption matters and fraud in the oil-for-food programme. Garcia has also been Interpol’s vice-president of the Americas and served on the executive committee, the body charged with overseeing the budget and strategic direction of the organisation. Garcia investigated the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups . He was appointed by Sepp Blatter in 2012 to investigate allegations of corruption in world football and given authority to order fresh probes into other old cases. ‘He will have not only to write, but the duty to have this case analysed on ethic, moral matters and then to report back to the executive committee,’ Blatter said at a news conference to announce his appointment. In an interview given to the New York Times in 2006, Garcia, who is married to an FBI agent and has three children, revealed that his aim was to ‘punish people who do bad things and break the law.’ Garcia grew up in Long Island, majored in American literature and wrote his master’s thesis on Mark Twain. He says that The Count of Monte Cristo is his idea of relaxing reading. He earned a scholarship to the Albany Law School of Union University.

"This year has seen Britney Spears admit to having lip fillers, Christine Hamilton opting for a non-surgical face lift and Sharon Osbourne returning to the X-Factor looking younger than when she started the show nine years ago. And new statistics reveal that cosmetic treatments were big news in 2013 with the vampire facial and varicose vein operations proving the most popular. The vampire facial treatment, which involves drawing the patient’s own blood, separating the layer that is filled with platelets and then injecting it back into the face, has seen an 800 per cent increase this year. It's bloody popular! The vampire facial, which involves drawing the patient's own blood then injecting it back into the face and is loved by Kim Kardashian, has seen an 800 per cent increase . Although it has been used to treat sports stars’ injuries – such as Kobi Bryant and Tiger Woods – for some time, only recently has it been used for anti-ageing purposes. Kim Kardashian ensured it hit the headlines when tweeted her way through a session in March this year. The high price tag - one treatment costs an average of £538 - hasn’t put people off. Anti-ageing treatments were a key theme in 2013 with dermal fillers, non-surgical facelifts and energy treatments to tighten skin all seeing increases of 93 per cent, 93 per cent and 80 per cent respectively. Pixel laser resurfacing, which promises to smooth out fine lines, dropped by 59 per cent in the past 12 months, as more sophisticated alternatives - such as radio-frequency based treatment Thermage - became available in the UK, which required far less downtime for patients. Movers and shakers: Varicose veins treatments are biggest riser of 2013 . Fat dermal fillers dropped by over a third (34 per cent) as a hefty price tag of more than £1,800 pushed patients towards more affordable non-invasive treatments. Next year, WhatClinic.com, who compiled the results, predict that nitrogen plasma facials will be highly sought after. Already popular in the US, there are already five UK clinics using plasma energy instead of laser to generate new skin and stimulate collagen, with less bruising or discomfort and no bleeding. Experts claim that plasma provides a greater level of control with less recovery time and, unlike lasers, can treat delicate eye areas. Ultherapy, a non-invasive, non-surgical treatment that uses ultrasound to encourage the production of collagen to tighten skin, is set to be a big trend next year, having seen a fivefold increase in enquiries since it received FDA approval in August. Another one to watch for 2014 is ultrasonic cavitation, with enquiries up by 328 per cent in the last three months alone. The procedure, also known as ‘ultrasound liposuction’, again uses sound wave energy at low frequencies but this time targeting intractable fat cells without the need for down time or anaesthetic. A spokesperson for WhatClinic.com said: 'This year has seen some exciting new treatments come to market, which are already driving interest with patients looking for non-surgical alternatives. 'Non-surgical interventions such as laser treatment, IPL and injectables all carry serious risks. We recommend researching your practitioner to ensure they are not only experienced and qualified, but that they are covered for all possible risks, including accidents. 'Make sure their insurance also covers the tools and equipment they use.'

"A year after losing her sister to cystic fibrosis, a 17-year-old girl has received a life-changing vest to combat the same condition thanks to the generosity of people in a Queensland town. Cystic fibrosis makes breathing difficult for Bundaberg's Sabrina Zwarts as a sticky mucus develops in her lungs and the best way to improve her quality of life was to get a $20,000 vest that needed to be imported from the United States. The percussion vest means Sabrina's lung capacity will go from 55 per cent up to 90 per cent, along with physiotherapy and other treatments. To help pay for the vest, Sabrina and her family kick started a campaign to raise the money. But four months into fundraising efforts, the Zwartses hit a snag and donations dried up, just $7,000 away from their goal. Cystic fibrosis sufferer Sabrina Zwarts, 17, has received a $20,000 vest that will help improve her quality of life . This is when Bundaberg's Friendly Society Private Hospital stepped in and helped make up the rest of the funds. Without the vest, Sabrina's father, Vincent, said his daughter could visit the hospital up to six times a year, staying about two to three weeks at a time. 'It depends on her environment. If she was exposed to the cold or something like that then she would go more when they couldn’t treat her with antibiotics,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Both Vincent and Sabrina said they were grateful for all the support they had received. 'It shows that no matter where you live you have a good community behind you and when you ask for support they’ll support you,' Sabrina said. 'Receiving the vest, at the end day, I’ll live a longer and healthier life and get the mucus off my chest.' This glimmer of hope comes after the one-year anniversary of the death of Sabrina's sister, Jessica, who lost her battle with cystic fibrosis in May last year at just 18 years old. The vest was donated to the Zwarts by Bundaberg's Friendly Society Private Hospital . Jessica Zwarts (left) died last year from cystic fibrosis, the same condition her sister, Sabrina (right), is now fighting . Both siblings were diagnosed at birth - Jessica in 1994 and Sabrina in 1997. Their father, Vincent, said they were heartbreaking blows to the family. 'When [the hospital] told us about Jess...they didn’t know what to say to us,' he said. 'We hadn’t heard of it before. 'To make a long story short, they told us to enjoy her while we still could because she was not going to have a long life. 'Most kids back then would not see their teenage years.' And with Sabrina, it did not get any easier. 'We were devastated about Sabrina because we saw what Jessica had to go through. There were no words for it,' Mr Zwarts said. 'We decided we didn’t want to have any kids because of that reason.' But due to technological advances, pregnant women were able to be tested to see if their babies would have cystic fibrosis. So the Zwarts had two more kids, 10-year-old Isabela and 11-year-old Vincent Junior - who are carriers of the illness' gene but do not have the condition. But even if they did have cystic fibrosis, Mr Zwarts said they would still have had Isabella and Vincent because he and his second wife did not believe in abortion. The Zwarts family - Vincent Junior, 11, Sabrina, 17, Vincent Senior and Isabela, 10 - have turned their experiences with cystic fibrosis into something positive . Sabrina (pictured here with her dad, Vincent) and her family have been trying to raise money for the vest that needed to be imported from the United States . While most families would find it hard to stay positive through such tough times, the Zwarts have used their experiences to raise awareness about the illness. 'Sabrina and myself feel very strongly about raising awareness of cystic fibrosis and educating people about this horrible illness as there is still no cure,' Mr Zwarts said. 'I lost my daughter Jessica to cystic fibrosis last year...and I'm not going to lose another daughter. 'I'm so lucky Sabrina has a very positive outlook on life and is very compliant with her treatment.' Mr Zwarts said he wanted to raise more awareness because there needed to be more government support for families who were dealing with the devastating illness. 'It wasn’t easy in the first six months when Jessica passed away and we used that to further our determination,' he said. 'There’s a lot of treatment and medication overseas and those with it overseas have a longer life span than those with it in Australia. 'With treatments like the vest we have it’s non-existent [in Australia] unless people do what we did by fundraising or buying it from the US directly, but the government doesn’t help at all.' The illness means Sabrina has trouble breathing because a sticky mucus develops in her lungs . Mr Zwarts said he was also lobbying Health Minister Peter Dutton to put a medication that would improve the lifestyle of cystic fibrosis sufferers on the Pharmaceutical Benefits System. 'Kalydeco is available overseas in the US and the UK, and it’s a tablet that improves lung function and improves weight gain,' he said. 'To buy it privately it costs $300,000 a year in Australia. 'Kids are dying because we don’t have this medication [readily available] in Australia.' But the most important thing to Sabrina about raising awareness of the disease is making sure no one living with cystic fibrosis feels isolated. 'We want everyone that has cystic fibrosis to know you're not alone, and to keep up with your treatments and your medications because if you don’t you won’t have a longer or healthier life,' she said.","Sabrina Zwarts - a 17-year-old girl from Queensland - has cystic fibrosis .

"A team of older men have celebrated completing a pioneering 35-year health study - beating killer diseases by making simple changes to their lifestyle. Health experts told volunteers to follow five simple rules - eat well, work out, drink less, keep their weight down and never smoke.

The study in South Wales is the longest of its kind to examine the influence of environmental factors in chronic disease. From 1979 to the present day, researchers from Cardiff University followed the lifestyle habits of men aged 45-59 living in the Caerphilly area. They found that those who followed four or five of the specified healthy steps were 60 per cent less likely to develop dementia. Noel Fowler, 91, stayed the course for 35 years.

I've been refereeing for nearly 30 years now and still get a thrill out of it.' Ray Grace, a member of the British and American Football Referees Association, has no intention of retiring from the sport he loves . Mr Grace said: 'I'll go on as long as I am able to. I've been refereeing for nearly 30 years now and still get a thrill out of it' Mr Grace said he was happy to co-operate with researchers throughout the life of the project saying: 'As far as I'm concerned it's been a great success. 'It has been invaluable for me and I'm pleased to have been part of it. 'I've stuck pretty well to the healthy lifestyle laid down and met with the researchers half a dozen times over the years. 'It has been invaluable for me and I'm pleased to have been part of it.' The volunteers gave researchers regular reports of their physical activity, alcohol consumption, and diet. Their wives and families helped by completing a food frequency questionnaire. The recommended physical activity was to walk two or more miles to work each day, cycle 10 or more miles to work each day, or regular 'vigorous' exercise.

Every five years the men were re-questioned and re-examined along with their medical records to identify new cases of diabetes, heart disease and strokes. Professor Peter Elwood, who has led the School of Medicine study since its inception, said the findings were a 'wake-up' call. 'Thirty years ago, only 30 men in our study followed all five of our recommended healthy steps,' he said. 'Although following these steps does not give them complete protection against disease, the men who, despite living healthily, developed a disease did so at a much older age than the men neglectful of their lifestyle. 'Thus the development of heart disease was delayed by up to six years and it was up to around an additional 12 years before dementia took its grip. 'On the less rosy end of the spectrum, 40 men in every 100 lived a life so neglectful that by any definition their lifestyle was unhealthy. They experienced none of the reductions in disease.' Professor Elwood added: 'The appalling fact is that recent surveys across the whole of Wales yield almost identical proportions of men and women following the healthy and unhealthy lifestyles found in Caerphilly 35 years ago. 'And the picture isn't much better in England: 53 per cent of men drink more than the recommended amount and only half of men meet the government-recommended scores for well-being.' The advice given by the project has become familiar from other research showing that staying slim, eating lots of fruit and vegetables, exercising regularly, drinking in moderation and never smoking boosts longevity. The Caerphilly participants come from a community where consumption of fruit and vegetables was low, so three or more portions a day was accepted as 'healthy'. Fat making up less than 30 per cent of calories was classed as a good diet. Those regarded as physically active were walking two or more miles or cycling ten or more to work each day, or taking 'vigorous' exercise regularly. Low alcohol consumption was defined as three or fewer units per day, with abstinence not treated as healthy behaviour. Clare Walton, of the Alzheimer's Society which part-funded the project, said: 'These studies are expensive and complicated but essential to understand how dementia can be prevented.' The Caerphilly research was a pilot for the much larger UK BIOBANK study involving more than 500,000 Britons. This is led by Professor John Gallacher, who also works at Cardiff.","The men in their 80s and 90s completed a pioneering 35-year health study .

"A 'scrotal condom' has been developed to cover the entire crotch area during sex, to lower the risk of catching sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Scroguard is worn with a condom and reduces skin on skin contact, lowering the risk of catching infections like herpes or genital warts which are transmitted through contact with skin. It has been designed people who want extra 'peace of mind', men with a high sex drive who enjoy sexual variety and couples and individuals who 'love to swing', developers said. Scroll down for video . Scroguard is worn with a condom and reduces skin on skin contact, lowering the risk of catching infections like herpes or genital warts which are transmitted through contact with skin . Made from rubber latex – the same material as normal condoms - Scroguard covers the whole area, shielding the skin and blocking genital secretions . STI's are transmitted through unprotected sex, genital secretions, skin-on-skin contact or contact with open sores. Normal male condoms are designed to stop a man's semen from coming into contact with his partner, and can protect against STIs when worn properly. They protect the skin around the penis, but leave the scrotum and pubic region uncovered. Made from rubber latex – the same material as normal condoms - Scroguard covers the whole area, shielding the skin and blocking genital secretions. Writing on their website, Scroguard's developers said: 'Both genital herpes and HPV can spread to your scrotum and pubic region through direct skin-to-skin contact and genital secretions during sex, even from someone who has completely normal looking skin with no visible warts or sores.' 'And, in the U.S., more than 50 per cent of sexually active men and women will get at least one of these STDs at some point in their lives.' Scroguard was developed by two entrepreneurs based in Atlanta in the U.S., who made their first prototype in March this year. However the developers warn a farting noise might occur during sex if air gets inside the pants . They said on their website: 'Football players wear protective pads so they can play harder. 'Skiers wear helmets so they can go faster. 'Soldiers wear armour so they can excel in battle. 'Men wear Scroguard so they can enjoy sex to the fullest, while reducing skin-to-skin contact.' However, a disclaimer on their website warns that the product is not officially approved by the U.S. Food and Drug administration, and isn't officially designed to protect against STI's. The legal disclaimer said: 'Scroguard is not a medical device and has not been evaluated or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.' They added that customers should contact a doctor and follow official regulations to reduce the risk of catching an STI. For those interested, Scroguard costs $19.99 with a $5.80 handling fee, and is machine washable. It's one-size fits all and developers warn a farting noise might occur during sex if air gets inside the pants. It may arrive a little bit sticky as it's made of latex, but it's still 'perfectly normal and still OK to use', they added. Daisy Ellis, acting policy director at Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'This is certainly a novel take on safer sex, but it’s not one you can expect to see on the shelves of your local chemist any time soon. 'The Scroguard isn’t FDA-approved, it isn’t marketed as a medical device, and there’s no evidence that it offers any more protection against STIs than the condom you would have to use alongside it anyway. 'The only way you could describe this as a step forward is if you’ve previously kept your cagoule on during sex.'","'Scroguard' has been developed by two entrepreneurs in the U.S.

Paul Richardson took 20,000 shots and patched them together to make an intricate timelapse video that shows the capital teeming with life. The dedicated 25-year-old was out on the streets from 10am to 5am capturing shots - from Oxford Circus to Covent Garden to Big Ben. Nocturnal life: Boats sail up and down the River Thames all through the night. Photographer Paul Richardson, 25, spent up to 19 hours each day on the streets of London to capture life in the city . Referring to Frank Sinatra's song 'Theme from New York, New York,' he said: 'I love the city as it never sleeps, there's always something going on which is interesting to shoot.' Even when the light dims and the last of the rush hour commuters make their way home, London continues to buzz with activity. Boats chug up and down the River Thames in front of St Paul's Cathedral even as day turns to night. Buzzing: Piccadilly Circus is full of Londoners going about their daily lives. In the midst of all the chaos Paul sits patiently photographing the world go by . Calm: Sunrise at Primrose Hill gave Paul a break from the hustle and bustle of London life . He said: 'In London everyone's always got something to do, somewhere to be. Everyone is always busy, busy, busy. I wanted to capture that in this video.' Paul, from Manchester, spent up to five hours in one position watching life go by and snapping away. He said: 'In the midst of all that chaos I was able to relax. Especially at Primrose Hill where I watched the sun rise. For a change, everything was quiet. 'It was just me, my lens, and a few other photographers capturing the sun rise. 'As the sun came up, more and more people appeared. First the joggers, then people on their way to work, then the tourists. Another day in London had just begun.'","Paul Richardson spent 19 hours a day on the streets of London .

"In 2002, then-Chelsea striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink finished the Premier League season with 23 goals to his name. Only Thierry Henry (24) scored more than the Dutchman who, at the age 30, had confirmed his status as one of Europe's top marksmen. It was the second season in a row he had scored 23 in the top flight and the sixth consecutive season in which Hasselbaink had notched more than 15 goals in one of Europe's top divisions.

Southend (A), December 19. 7th* . *League position . The year 2002 was also a significant one for Burton Albion. Under the guidance of player-manager Nigel Clough the Brewers were promoted to the Conference for the first time in their relatively short history after winning the Unibond League. It is truly remarkable, then, that Hasselbaink is in the Burton hotseat just 12 years later. But rather than it being a fall from grace for the 42-year-old - whose only previous managerial experience was last season at Belgian second tier side Royal Antwerp - it is instead a testament to the rise in stature of a club well-run by long-serving chairman Ben Robinson and his board. That being said, Hasselbaink will no doubt find the confines of the Pirelli Stadium and League Two somewhat different to playing at Stamford Bridge and at the 1998 World Cup. Here's what Hasselbaink can expect to find at Burton Albion... Burton Albion play their home games at the 6,912-seater Pirelli Stadium (above) FACILITIES . The thought of League Two training grounds conjures images of Southend's converted gym or AFC Wimbledon's borrowed recreation park, not of state of the art facilities costing £120million. Well, that's exactly what Hasselbaink and his players have to work with at the National Football Centre at St George's Park. Situated in Burton, the FA allowed Albion to train at St George's throughout its construction and they have continued to do so since its official opening in October 2012. Burton have planning permission in place to build training facilities on the site of their Pirelli Stadium but have not needed to do so after being given permission to remain at St George's for the 'foreseeable future'. UEFA president Michel Platini (second right) visits St George's Park - where Burton train - last week . England players (left to right) Jordan Henderson, Wayne Rooney and Raheem Sterling train at St George's . Hasselbaink - who coached at Nottingham Forest from July 2011 to January 2013 - admitted to being 'delighted' with the facilities. 'They are the best in the country,' he said on Thursday. His predecessor Gary Rowett admitted to Sportsmail in September 2012: 'I've sold the club to some of the new signings by showing them that we're training at one of the best training grounds in the world - not many League Two clubs can say that!' The Pirelli, while lacking the grandeur of St George's, is a smart, new stadium (built in 2005) with potential to expand its 6,912 capacity. SQUAD . Hasselbaink's predecessor Gary Rowett, who left to take the Birmingham City job last month, has built a squad more than capable of mounting an automatic promotion challenge. In his two-and-a-half years at the club, Rowett steadily improved the quality of the playing staff, mainly bringing in free transfers and loans to achieve successive play-off finishes. Burton lost to Fleetwood in the League Two final at Wembley in May and at the semi-final stage the year before. Gary Rowett - who left Burton last month - celebrates his first win as Birmingham City manager . Under Clough, in charge from 1998 to 2009, and Paul Peschisolido, who oversaw their first Football League season in 2009-10 before being sacked in March 2012, Burton were reliant on journeymen brought in using the contacts of those two ex-players. Hasselbaink though will find plenty of youth and energy in his squad. Wingers Alex MacDonald, 24, and Lucas Akins, 25, are both vital to the way Burton were playing under Rowett, while academy product Matt Palmer is a promising midfielder. There is experience in the backline with the presence of Ian Sharps and Shane Cansdell-Sheriff - a Leeds academy product during their halcyon days under David O'Leary which Hasselbaink was a part of - while captain Lee Bell is an assured performer in midfield. Hasselbaink watches from the touchline as his Royal Antwerp side face KAS Eupen in September 2013 . But the man who will surely be most excited about working with Hasselbaink is striker Stuart Beavon. The 30-year-old ex-Wycombe man took the step down from League One to join on a free from Preston in the summer but has scored just three times this season. Beavon has the pedigree to fire Burton to promotion if he can strike an understanding with MacDonald, Akins and former Aston Villa youngster Adam McGurk in the attacking third. FORM . Burton, as they have been for the last two seasons, are cemented in the League Two play-off positions. Hasselbaink's new side sit fifth in the table but are just three points off leaders Wycombe and have a five-point cushion to the chasing pack. Their form over the last two months has been poor though. The Brewers picked up 19 points from a possible 21 in their opening seven games but the next nine games have yielded just 10 more, with only three wins in that time. Burton's players trudge off the pitch after they were beaten 5-0 by Barnsley on Saturday . When Rowett, heralded as one of the brightest young British managers in the Football League, left Burton, they were already in a downward spiral. Burton's inconsistent performances continued under caretaker Mike Whitlow and they were thumped 5-0 in the FA Cup first round by League One Barnsley on Saturday. They have in fact lost nine of their last 13 games in all competitions. Everything is in place for Hasselbaink and his assistant David Oldfield to guide Burton Albion to League One, but first they must deal with the club's recent slump. His start couldn't be tougher. Burton travel to table-topping Wycombe on Monday night before facing second-placed Luton and third-placed Shrewsbury.","Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink appointed Burton Albion manager .

"Parents claim their teenage daughters have been left in tears, and worrying about their weight after teachers told the pupils their trousers were too tight. Furious mothers and fathers claim their daughters have been left upset and 'feeling fat' after the  row at Headlands School in Bridlington, East Yorkshire. Parents say their children have been told by teachers their black school trousers are too tight around the 'calf and bottom areas' and are not part of the school uniform. Scroll down for video . Jaydee Hart (left), 13, Chloe Gregory (centre), 14, and Amelia Wileman (right),13, say they have been told their uniforms are unsuitable by bosses at Headlands School in Bridlington, East Yorkshire . And another pupil claims they were told by teachers: 'It's not my fault you can't find trousers big enough'. Sian Hart said her 13-year-old daughter, Jaydee, was among those taken out of class and told her trousers were too tight. She said: 'She has been wearing the same uniform ever since she started at Headlands. 'She's very skinny and tall and I really struggle to find trousers that fit her. 'I bought her trousers from New Look, in the school range, and to me she looks perfectly fine but apparently the school thinks the trousers are too tight.' The mother-of-three said Jaydee and her friend were both taken out of an English lesson over the issue. She said: 'They have threatened to put them in isolation. A girl in the year above my daughter has been excluded for wearing tight trousers. 'I am not buying any more trousers, it's ridiculous. There are more pressing issues the school should be concentrating on.' The angry parents of the schoolgirls have now launched a Facebook group, called Headlands Parents Uniform Unite, to complain. Headteacher Sarah Bone, left, said the school has high expectations about the school uniform . One parent posted her views on the Facebook group and said: 'My daughter is now in floods of tears about this issue. 'She has come home today after a warning that her ""trousers may be causing an infringement as they are tight around the calf and bottom area"".' The parent claimed the trousers had previously passed a uniform check by the headteacher. Another parent posted: 'My daughter was told ""it's not my fault you can't find trousers big enough"" and she was not the only one to be told this. 'Girls have put on Facebook how they now feel fat and extremely upset.' Headteacher Sarah Bone said the school has high expectations about the school uniform, which parents were consulted about in 2012. Sarah Bone said: 'All students are required to wear full school uniform at all times, including to and from school. 'Where parents are having difficulty with the cost of uniform, I would ask them to contact their head of year for a confidential discussion. 'Dealing with inappropriate uniform matters detracts from time devoted to learning, so thank you to all our parents and students who have supported us in this matter. 'Students who are not in correct uniform, in line with Department for Education guidance, may be sent home to change or secluded from other students at breaks and lunchtimes.' During the first week of term, Mrs Bone said five students were either sent home or placed in isolation over uniform issues.","Parents furious after teenage daughters left in tears over trousers row .

"Business minister Nick Boles said Britain would noy be able to 'entirely' control European migration as long as it stayed in the EU . We will never be able to control our borders so long as Britain remains in the EU, a Tory minister warned last night. In an explosive interview, skills minister Nick Boles said the free movement of people is a fundamental principle of the EU that Britain has to accept. As long as the UK remains a successful economy, Britons need to get used to a ‘very large amount of immigration every year’. Mr Boles’s words blow a hole in David Cameron’s argument that he can claw back any meaningful powers from Brussels over UK borders. They will also be seized on by Ukip and Eurosceptic Tories as proof that his talks with Brussels will achieve little. German chancellor Angela Merkel has already said she would not agree to any ‘tampering’ with EU migration rules. In an interview with Total Politics magazine, Mr Boles insisted the British people would favour a reasonable level of immigration if they thought Parliament had control. But he admitted that those who believed MPs did not have such control were ‘right’. ‘I will always make the argument that we should, for cultural, economic, justice and equality reasons, always have a reasonable level of immigration,’ he said. ‘It will always be the position the British people would arrive at if they feel they have control over immigration. You can win that argument but only if people know that they, through their Parliament, are in control. ‘The difficulty that has arisen is this sense that we don’t have that control – and, bluntly, they’re right. It’s true.’ He added: ‘We may never be able to control it entirely, because it’s a fundamental principle of the EU, but it will be very hard for the British people to accept that.’ Last night Mr Boles clarified his statements, saying: ‘I do not believe and did not say that we cannot seek changes to the way immigration works within the EU. Quite the contrary, I think it is essential that we do so.’ Meanwhile, it emerged the Tory bill to enshrine in law Mr Cameron’s promised referendum in 2017 on whether Britain should stay in the EU will not be voted on in the Commons – due to a row with his Lib Dem partners. Tory MP Bob Neill, who was taking the bill through Parliament, accused Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg of ‘killing off our chances’ of putting it into law. David Cameron gave a statement to the Commons yesterday on the latest EU fallout over its demand for an extra £1.7billion from Britain . National Insurance numbers (NINOs) have been handed out to more than 420,000 people from the EU, up from 285,000 in the year before the coalition was formed . Spain, Romania, Greece and Italy have seen the biggest increases in NINOs in the last six years, according to official government figures . UKIP leader Nigel Farage (left) with the EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, has dismissed the Prime Minister's chances of reforming EU freedom of movement rules .","Nick Boles said UK would 'never be able to control' immigration entirely .

"Would you intervene if you saw saw domestic abuse right in front of you? A social experiment carried out in Sweden has shockingly revealed only two per cent of people would speak out if they were witness to violence between a couple. Organisation STHLM Panda use hidden cameras to explore human nature in broadcasts that are aired online. Their latest offering took place in an elevator. The actors play out a domestic abuse scene, and the lady on the left is the only one of 53 to interrupt . Two 'couples' engage in a fierce argument that leads to the man in each scene placing his hands on the woman, pushing and shoving her to the wall. Of 53 people who had shared the lift with the actors, only one person spoke out. One woman stands with her shopping keeping herself to herself, keeping out of the incident, even when a slap is heard. People play on their phones and generally seem apathetic to the terrible scene . Sweden has a high rate of harassment cases compared to the EU average . Another girl stands playing on her phone, a man with what looks like office documents observes the 'assault' and then exits the elevator despite hearing the assailant telling the girl that he will 'kill' her. Thankfully someone finally speaks out, as a lady with a blue coat tells the man who has been pushing and shoving his partner that she will 'call the police' if he touches her again. Her look of surprise is expected when she is told by the actors that it is a social experiment. Even more so when the man tells her that she is the only one of 53 people who spoke up. 'I can't believe people are not reacting,' says the girl in blue before making her exit. The group plan to do a second broadcast on domestic abuse against a man and see whether the results are any different. The man pushes and shoves the girl in the social experiment . Sweden continues to struggle with dealing with harassment. A report released this year revealed that 81 per cent of women said they had been harassed at some point after the age of 15 in the country, compared to the EU average of 55. The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights published a report earlier this year entitled: ‘Violence against women: an EU-wide survey’, which listed Sweden as having the highest rate of sexual harassment experienced by women.' Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Finland all saw rates above 70 percent. The EU member state with the lowest rate was Bulgaria, with 24 percent. Earlier this year Police assessments from 33 of the 44 forces in England, Wales and Scotland obtained by the Guardian revealed that 10,952 people, mainly women, were categorised as being at high risk of facing a violent death in the home or of suffering severe violence, in the year to November. Will affect 1 in 4 women and 1 in 6 men in their lifetime. Leads to, on average, two women being murdered each week and 30 men per year. Accounts for 16 per cent of all violent crime (Source: Crime in England and Wales 04/05 report), however it is still the violent crime least likely to be reported to the police. Has more repeat victims than any other crime (on average there will have been 35 assaults before a victim calls the police). Is the single most quoted reason for becoming homeless (Shelter, 2002). In 2010 the Forced Marriage Unit responded to 1735 reports of possible Forced Marriages. From Living Without Abuse (LWA) Two women a week die from domestic abuse in England and Wales, with many more suffering long-lasting mental and emotional harm. In 2012/13, there were 1.2 million female and 700,000 male victims of domestic abuse in England and Wales. Data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales suggests that 30 per cent of women and 16.3 per cent of men in England and Wales will experience domestic violence in their lifetime. In August this year the Home Secretary, Theresa May, launched an eight-week consultation on strengthening current laws on domestic violence. A main focus was whether coercive and controlling behaviour in intimate relationships should be a specific offence. And just days ago, Public Health England launched two initiatives to help deal with domestic violence for universities and businesses. The The bystander ‘Intervention Initiative’ was done in conjunction with the University of West of England to encourage students to stand up against abuse. Intervention Initiative development lead, Dr. Rachel Fenton from the University of West of England said: 'The Intervention Initiative works by educating students to recognise and understand sexual and domestic violence and take active steps when they witness problematic behaviour. 'It takes a positive approach, encouraging all students to be active bystanders, standing up against any form of violence or abuse in their community.The eight-week programme teaches students the necessary communication and leadership skills to intervene effectively and safely, and to change the social norm, making problematic violent behaviour socially unacceptable.' And the same type of programme is being introduced in the workplace; toolkits for both the projects will be available online through the government department. Professor Kevin Fenton, director of Health and Wellbeing at Public Health England, said: 'It is unacceptable that in England and Wales, two women a week die as a result of domestic violence, and many more suffer physical and mental harm. 'Workplaces are a safe space for many people living in violence and are key for providing opportunities for disclosure and support into safety. 'As it stands, companies can do more to support their employees who experience domestic abuse, train those who witness, and protect staff as a whole.'

"Mexican police are still searching hospitals for the thieves who exposed themselves to fatal amounts of radiation by opening a container of 'extremely dangerous' stolen Cobalt-60 earlier this week. The truck transporting the highly radioactive material was stolen on Tuesday and located the following day about a kilometer from the farming town of Hueypoxtla. The cobalt-60 was discovered opened in a an empty parking lot not far from the truck, which means the thieves are most likely suffering from radiation poisoning. 'They will eventually have to go to a hospital, and we'll be waiting for them,' Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission official Mardonio Jimenez said. Scroll down for video . Found: A firefighter takes photographs of the radiation head that was part of a radiation therapy machine, on the patio of the family who found the abandoned radiation head in a nearby field . Who did it? The container went missing on Tuesday while en route to a waste facility. It was recovered the next day, but opened which means that whoever opened is probably suffering from radiation poisoning . Packed: The above photo shows the box containing the teletherapy equipment . According to Juan Eibenschutz, director general of the National Commission of Nuclear Safety and Safeguards, the shipment of Cobalt-60 was Category 1 meaning 'it would probably be fatal to be close to this amount of unshielded radioactive material for a period in the range of a few minutes to an hour.' Authorities are now in the process of containing the material in order to transport it to a waste site, which they estimate will take about two days. 'It's a very delicate operation. What's important is that the material has been located and the place is being watched to guarantee no one gets close,' Juan Eibenschutz, director of the National Commission of Nuclear Safety and Safeguards, told the Associated Press. Dangerous situation: Representatives of the National Commission of Nuclear Safety and the Mexican Federal Police stand guard near the radiation container in a field near the village of Hueypoxtla . Cleaning up: The stolen container was found in a field in a rural town in central Mexico. Authorities are now working at containing the radioactive material . Cordoned off: Authorities are restricting access to the area surrounding the container so no one is accidentally exposed to the radioactive material . The container was discovered by a family, who were promptly put under medical observation, but according to Hueypoxtla's mayor, Javier Santillan, they suffered no harm. The truck marked 'Transportes Ortiz' left Tijuana on November 28 and was on its way to a nuclear waste facility when the driver stopped to rest at a gas station in Tepojaco, in Hidalgo state north of Mexico City. The driver, Valentin Escamilla Ortiz, told authorities he was sleeping in the truck when two men with a gun approached about 1:30am Tuesday. They made him get out, tied his hands and feet and left him in a vacant lot nearby. Safe: The family who discovered the stolen container were taken to a hospital for medical observation, but were not harmed. Above, a picture of other residents looking at the container from a distance . Watching: Policemen patrol atop a vehicle as residents look on near the perimeter where dangerous radioactive medical material was found . When he was able to free himself, he ran back to the gas station to get help. Police and military quickly joined the hunt to find the missing cobalt-60 because it could be used by terrorists to create a 'dirty bomb'. But authorities don't believe that the thieves who stole the truck did it to intentionally steal the cobalt-60. Eibenschutz said that the thieves were mostly likely after the white 2007 Volkswagon cargo vehicle. On average, a half dozen thefts of radioactive materials are reported in Mexico each year and none have proven to be aimed at the cargo, Eibenschutz said. He said that in all the cases the thieves were after shipping containers or the vehicles. Unintentional thefts of radioactive materials are not uncommon, said an official familiar with cases reported by International Atomic Energy Agency member states, who was not authorized to comment on the case. In some cases, radioactive sources have ended up being sold as scrap, causing serious harm to people who unknowingly come into contact with it. Exposure: None of the locals were harmed when the container was opened. Above, residents talk with each other as they wait for news on the radioactive material . In a Mexican case in the 1970s, one thief died and the other was injured when they opened a container holding radioactive material, he said. The container was junked and sold to a foundry, where it contaminated some steel reinforcement bars made there. Eibenschutz said all foundries in Mexico now have equipment to detect radioactive material. On the lookout: Mexican authorities scrambled Wednesday to find a truck containing 'extremely dangerous' radioactive material used in medical treatment. The truck and its contents have now been found seperately .","A truck carrying 'extremely dangerous' cobalt-60 was stolen in Mexico on Tuesday .
The truck was found the next day, but the container of radioactive material was found opened in a separate location .
Police believe that the thieves who stole the truck accidentally exposed themselves to dangerous amounts of radiation .

"Rohit Sharma scored the highest ever individual score in a one-day international and became the first player to score two career double centuries in a 50-over match with 264 against Sri Lanka. The sensational innings on a batsman-friendly Kolkata  came off 173 balls with 33 fours and nine sixes, and only ended on the last ball of India's innings as Sharma holed out in the deep. Sharma said he was 'ready to bat another 50 overs' after walking off the Eden Gardens with his side on a formidable 404 for five after winning the toss and batting first. His score alone would have won the match by 13 runs after the visitors were all out in the 44th over for 251. India's Rohit Sharma hit 264 from 173 balls against Sri Lanka for the highest ever ODI score on Thursday . Sri Lanka were made to pay for dropping the destructive 27-year-old in the fifth over with his tally just four runs at the time. Sharma's innings demolishes Virender Sehwag's previous record of a 149-ball 219 against the West Indies in 2011. Sharma also has the third top score in ODIs with his 209 off 158 balls against Australia in November last year. Sharma's knock got off to a modest start with the opener reaching his hundred in even time, with his first 50 off 72 balls and his second 50 in a swift 28 deliveries. From then it was a procession for the right-hander. His third 50 took 25 balls and the 50 up to his 200 took just 26 deliveries. With the end in sight, and Sharma looking to cash in knowing 350 is an achievable target at this ground, he reached 250 in a further 15 balls. 1) ROHIT SHARMA (India) 264 (173 balls) v Sri Lanka, November 13, 2014 . 2) VIRENDER SEHWAG (India) 219 (149 ball) v West Indies, December 8, 2011 . 3) ROHIT SHARMA (India) 209 (158 balls) v Australia, November 2, 2013 . 4) SACHIN TENDULKAR (India) 200* (147 balls) v South Africa, February 24, 2010 . 5) CHARLES COVENTRY (Zimbabwe) 194* (156 balls) v Bangladesh, August 16, 2009 . 6) SAEED ANWAR (Pakistan) 194 (146 balls) v India, May 21, 1997 . 7) VIV RICHARDS (West Indies) 189* (170 balls) v England, May 31, 1984 . 8) MARTIN GUPTILL (New Zealand) 189* (155 balls) v England, June 2, 2013 . 9) SANATH JAYASURIYA  (Sri Lanka) 189 (161 balls) v India, October 29, 2000 . 10) GARY KIRSTEN (South Africa) 188* (159 balls) v UAE February 16, 1996 . 'Once I got to 50 I knew I had to make a century because it was a good batting wicket and we knew 350 was easily chaseable. That made me stay there as long as possible,' Sharma said on Sky Sports 2. 'It is important to look at the team score as that is how you build an innings.' Had opening bowler Nuwan Kulasekara been given his full allocation of 10 overs he could have made a century of his own after going for 89 runs off nine overs at a rate of 9.88. His only consolation was that it was off his bowling that Sharma's wicket fell, with the rampant 27-year-old finding the safe hands of Mahela Jayawardene instead of the middle of his bat. Coming into this match, Sharma had scored 142 for an India A side ina  warm-up against the Sri Lankans - his last knock before that was in August against England in Cardiff where he injured his hand. Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar are the only other players to have reached 200 in an ODI. One record Sharma fell short of was for the highest score for a limited-overs match, falling a single shot along the ground short of Alistair Brown's 268 for Surrey in 2002. India got off to the perfect start with the ball, removing Sri Lankan opener Kusal Perera without scoring with the third ball of their first over. Despite a mid-innings fightback from Angelo Mathews (75) and Lahiru Thiramine (59) the target proved a task too great and India took a 4-0 series lead with one match remaining. We are unable to carry live pictures from this match due to a dispute between the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and international news organisations. The BCCI has refused access to venues to established picture agencies Getty Images and Action Images and other Indian photographic agencies.

"Sir Mick Jagger may be one of the most famous musicians on the planet. But now there’s a new rock star that has been named in honour of him – a fossil of an extinct swamp-dwelling creature that lived 19 million years ago in Africa. The hippo-like creature has been given its name because, like the Rolling Stones' front man, it too has super-sized lips. A new rock star: An extinct swap-dwelling creature that lived 19 million years ago in Africa has been named after Sir Mick Jagger (pictured right) because they both have extra large lips. Top and side views of a fossilised jaw bone indicate that Jaggermeryx naida had big, sensitive lips and snout. The hippo-like animal's jaw bones suggest it was roughly the size of a small deer . ‘We gave it the scientific name Jaggermeryx naida, which translates to ‘Jagger’s water nymph,’” said Ellen Miller of Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Researchers uncovered the fossils, consisting of multiple jawbone fragments, amid the sand dunes and eroded rock of a remote site in the Egyptian desert. The creature belonged to a family of extinct hoofed animals called anthracotheres. Jaggermeryx is one of six species of anthracotheres found at the site, but what distinguished it from other members of this family was a series of tiny holes on either side of its jaw that held the nerves providing sensation to the chin and lower lip. The creature has been given the name Jaggermeryx naida, which translates to ‘Jagger’s water nymph' in honour of the Rolling Stones front man (pictured here at the band's most iconic performance at Hyde Park in 1969. The hippo-like extinct animal belonged to a family of extinct hoofed animals called anthracotheres . Jaggermeryx naida, which translates to ‘Jagger’s water nymph,' was named in honour of Sir Mick Jagger. It was a type of extinct swamp-dwelling creature that lived 19 million years ago in Africa. The creature belonged to a family of extinct hoofed animals called anthracotheres. It is one of a number of species of animals in the family and is distinguished from them by its highly innervated muzzle with mobile and tactile lips. It likely lived in a lush tropical delta in Africa with rivers and swampland. The animal was likely a vegetarian, using its lower teeth and large lips to scoop up vegetation. ‘The animal probably had a highly innervated muzzle with mobile and tactile lips, thus the Jagger reference,’ said Duke University palaeontologist Gregg Gunnell. The Egyptian site where the fossils were found is mostly desert today, but geological data suggest that millions of years ago it was a lush tropical delta crisscrossed by rivers and swampland, according to the study published in the Journal of Palaeontology. By examining the amount of different isotopes in the animal’s bones, experts think it ate plants. ‘It may have used its sensitive snout to forage along river banks, scooping up plants with its lower teeth and large lips,’ Dr Miller said. The Jaggermeryx fossils, which now reside in collections at Duke, the Cairo Geological Museum and Cairo University, were found alongside fossilised catfish, turtles, water birds and crocodile faeces. ‘Some of my colleagues suggested naming the new species after Hollywood star Angelina Jolie, because she also has famous lips. But for me it had to be Mick,’ said Dr Miller. Dr Gunnel added: ‘I was a huge Rolling Stones fan in my day. Exile on Main Street and Let it Bleed were my favorite albums.’","Hippo-like creature has been named in honour of Mick Jagger because of its large, sensitive lips, that it could have used to scoop up vegetation .

"New laws to force internet firms such as Google to take fresh action to crack down on child pornography will be introduced by David Cameron unless they beef up anti-porn controls. The Prime Minister will tomorrow call on online search giants and internet service providers to take drastic action to ‘obliterate’ child porn from the web. He will demand: . Concern: Today David Cameron appeared on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show and said 'I am concerned as a politician and a parent' about child porn on the web . Demands: In a speech in London tomorrow, Mr Cameron will tell the internet firms to develop the plans by the autumn or face new laws forcing them to do as he says . In a speech in London tomorrow, Mr Cameron will tell the internet firms to develop the plans by the autumn or face new laws forcing them to do as he says. He will say: ‘I have a very clear message for Google, Bing, Yahoo and the rest. You have a duty to act on this and it is a moral duty. ‘If the progress is slow or non-existent, I can tell you we are already looking at the legislative options we have to force action.’ Mr Cameron's initiative follows a meeting at Downing Street last week with the parents of Tia Sharp and April Jones. Warnings: From this month, anyone logging on to a child abuse site will receive a message that the images have been taken down . The parents of murdered schoolgirls Tia Sharp and April Jones met with David Cameron to plead for him to tighten controls on child abuse images online. Mark Bridger, was found guilty of abducting and murdering five-year-old April Jones in Powys last October. Bridger will spend his whole life in prison after he was found guilty of killing April in a sexually motivated attack. Sitting next to her mother Coral, April's father Paul Jones said: 'Everyone knows the Tia and April stories. What we are trying to do is stop it being another child. We never want another family sitting here having suffered the same thing,' reported The Sun. Stuart Hazell, admitted murdering 12-year-old Tia Sharp in August 2012. Hazell, 37, who was jailed for a minimum of 38 years in May, had sexually assaulted and murdered Tia when she stayed the night at the house. Her mother Natalie, who attended with her partner, told Mr Cameron during the 30-minute meeting at No. 10: 'It’s a triangle — the people uploading, the people letting them upload and the people looking for it. We need to knock the first, second and third parts of this triangle down like bowling pins.' The Prime Minster told the couples he had changed the locks on his iPad after he walked in on his daughter watching a video of how to make a bath bomb. 'I came down and she was watching a YouTube video which luckily was someone making a bath bomb. It could have been something completely different.'' The Prime Minister told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show he was prepared to bring in new laws if necessary. He said: 'I'm concerned as a . politician and as a parent about this issue, and I think all of us have . been a bit guilty of saying: well it's the internet, it's lawless, . there's nothing you can do about it. 'And that's wrong. I mean just because it's the internet doesn't mean there shouldn't be laws and rules, and also responsible behaviour.' He welcomed the steps already being . taken by internet firms, but added: 'There is this problem ... that some . people are putting simply appalling terms into the internet in order to . find illegal images of child abuse. 'And, remember, every one of these . pictures is a crime scene and they're getting results. I think it's . wrong that they should get results and we need to have very, very strong . conversations with those companies about saying no, you shouldn't . provide results for some terms that are so depraved and disgusting, I . can't even say them on your show. 'And that, I think, there's going to . be a big argument there, and if we don't get what we need we'll have to . look at legislation.' He added: 'Look, I believe in free . speech, but free speech doesn't mean you have the right to incite . murder, it doesn't mean you have the right to incite child abuse. 'So it's about companies wanting to act responsibly. If you think about it, there's really a triangle here. There are the people uploading the . images. We've got to go after them. There are the people looking at the . images. We've got to go after them. But there is also in this triangle . the companies that are enabling it to happen, and they do need to do . more to help us with this.' The warning follows an . anti-internet porn summit in Whitehall last month which agreed to give . the Internet Watch Foundation new powers to seek out and block offensive . material. In his speech, . Mr Cameron will hail the fact that from this month, anyone trying to log . on to a child abuse site will receive a warning that the site contained . illegal images and has been taken down . He will say: ‘This is a vital step  forward but we need to go further. These warning pages should also tell those who’ve landed on it that they face consequences, such as losing their job, their family, even access to their children if they continue.’ Zero tolerance: David Cameron says that search engine firms should introduce a blacklist of disgusting searches which should produce no results . Mr Cameron also says that search . engine firms should introduce a  ‘blacklist’ of disgusting searches . which should produce no result. He . will add: ‘There are some searches which are so abhorrent – and where . there can be no doubt whatsoever about the sick and malevolent intent . of the searcher – that there should be no search results at all.’ The Prime Minister warns the internet giants not to use technical problems as an excuse for inaction. He will say: ‘Set your greatest . brains to work on this. You are not separate from our society, you are . part of our society and you must play a responsible role in it. ‘This is quite simply about obliterating this disgusting material from the net – and we will do whatever  it takes.’ Last . night, a Google spokesman said: ‘We have a zero-tolerance attitude to . child sexual abuse imagery.

"For 50 years the Hartland carnival march has been accompanied by the sprightly sound of the town’s brass band. But this year, for the very first time, the band will not be marching. They have been stopped in their tracks by potholes. Concentrating on their instruments and reading music means they will not be able to pay attention to dodging holes in the road. Danger: Councillor Brian Redwood pictured with the Hartland Town Band in front of potholes in the road . Concern: The musicians say they could trip over the potholes while playing their instruments . The town is already known by locals as a dangerous place to walk or cycle, but the musicians are even more concerned because they are unable to watch the road while reading music. The band's chairman Charlie Jeffrey has written to Devon County Council, saying that the roads are so bad they are pulling out of the Hartland Carnival scheduled for August 9. 'Hartland Town Band is one of the many organisations in this rural community which provides the glue which holds the community together,' he wrote. 'This year is a centenary of the Hartland Carnival and the condition of the roads in the village itself has become too dangerous for our own visiting bands to be able to march safely.' The band was originally founded before the First World War, and has marched in the parade every year since 1961. There are 25 members of the ensemble, many of them in their 70s and one as old as 89. Anger: Flugelhorn player Rosalind Toase, centre, is concerned that their instruments could be damaged . Action: The council has so far failed to fill in the potholes because it does not have enough money . Flugelhorn player Rosalind Toase, who has played with the band for 20 years, said the group had no choice but to cancel their plans. 'Some of these potholes are so big you can see right through the tarmac to the earth below,' she said. 'The problem is that we're looking at our music the whole time so we can't see where we're going. We're not aware at all of what our feet are stepping on. 'If one of us was to put a foot in a hole we would probably end up losing a tooth and having our instrument damaged beyond repair. 'We've got people in their 70s marching - it wouldn't be very pretty to see them take a tumble. 'Hopefully the council will do something about it before August and we can perform.' Film: The band's troubles resemble the plot of the 1996 hit Brassed Off, pictured . Brass bands first emerged in Britain in the 19th century, and were originally associated with working-class industrial communities. Many of the bands had their origins in workplaces - above all coal mines and factories - while others were linked to anti-alcohol temperance movements. The Salvation Army is also known for its brass bands, which play public concerts to raise money for charitable causes. Some bands compete in contests, with regional competitions which eventually produce a national champion. The standard brass band feature a mixture of cornets, horns, trombones, euphoniums and tubas, as well as drummers. They tend to play a mixture of music composed specifically for brass and classical or pop tunes which have been adapted to the band's capacity. The band's plight bears some resemblance to 1996 film Brassed Off starring Ewan McGregor, which features a colliery band whose future is threatened by the closure of the coal mines. District councillor Brian Redwood said he was shocked by the news, and urged local authorities to repair the road as quickly as possible. 'To think that Hartland Town Band may not be in this year's procession is unbelievable,' he said. 'It will be a huge shame if the band does not perform and are obstructed by the plague of potholes in this area.' Devon County Council admitted that it did not have the resources to deal with the state of the town's roads. 'More than 12,000 potholes have been reported by the public or found by highway inspectors so far this year,' a spokesman said. 'In response the council has tripled the number of pothole repair teams working across the county. 'It's a harsh reality that the council simply does not have the funds to carry out all the works we would wish.'","Members of the Hartland Town Band march through the streets every year .

"When Daniella Jackson was diagnosed with cancer at five months pregnant her doctors quickly advised her to have an abortion. They said she needed a termination to allow her lung tumour to be removed before it killed her. But the 21-year-old, who is a devout Roman Catholic, refused, saying she felt too close to her unborn child. Against all odds: Daniella Jackson gave birth to healthy baby girl Rennae despite being advised to have an abortion to save her own life . Proud: Daniella after giving birth to the baby she put her own life at risk to have . Survivors: Daniella Jackson, 21, was diagnosed with a tumour in her lung shortly before discovering she was pregnant with her second child Rennae (pictured) A year on, she is the proud mother of  Rennae – her second child – and has been told that she is free of cancer. Yesterday she said: ‘I was always determined to have my baby. I felt such a close bond with her, I couldn’t let her go.’ Aborting her child was never an option because of her strong faith, Miss Jackson insisted. She was diagnosed with lung cancer after she fell ill on a camping trip with her partner of five years, Andrew Bartle, 22. For several months she had been having breathing problems but her condition got out of control when she went down with a fever on the break near Blackpool. The couple went to a doctor who, fearing a blood clot, referred Miss Jackson to casualty. There she was given an X-ray, an ultrasound scan and finally a CT scan, which revealed the four centimetre (1.5in) tumour. In the clear: Miss Jackson is now cancer-free . Despite the shocking news, she said she was determined not to heed the advice given to her by doctors at the Royal Preston Hospital that she should have an abortion to save her own life. ‘I was crying and so was my partner,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it was the end for me and my baby. ‘I felt like a ticking timebomb. I had nightmares about dying in labour. It was a bad time, my head was all over the place. ‘I just shut down and tried to get through as best as I could.’ Toward the end of her pregnancy, Miss Jackson’s lung disease was giving her asthma attacks on a daily basis. But she managed to battle on and, four months ago, gave birth four weeks early to Rennae, who weighed in at 6lb 3oz. The life-saving operation took place four weeks later and saw the removal of half of her lung. Now recovering at home, she says she wants to tell her story so that others realise that a disease like lung cancer can affect anyone – even young non-smokers like herself. Doctors said the onset of cancer in the case of Miss Jackson, who comes from Nottingham, was more likely to be caused by genetics rather than any lifestyle factors. Miracle baby: Rennae is a picture of health despite doctors' dire warnings . ‘If this can happen to me, it can happen to anyone,’ said the full- time mother. ‘People need to know this isn’t just an old person’s disease. I kept fit, I never smoked, and my world fell apart when I got this disease. ‘I’m just so thankful I have a future with my children and I’m surviving.’ She added: ‘Abortion is not part of my belief as a Catholic. Religion was part of my decision. I wanted to fight for my baby.’ Her surgeon, Antonio Martin-Ucar, said she was the youngest patient he had operated on with her type of lung cancer. ‘It was an unusual case,’ he added. ‘She was very young. We had to make the difficult decision to only remove the tumour once she’d had her baby.’ Miss Jackson’s first child, a son, is four-year-old Darnelle.","Daniella Jackson was diagnosed with a tumour in her left lung shortly before discovering she was pregnant .

"Big Bang Theory physicist Sheldon Cooper's favorite buzzword has a new claim to fame. The geeky TV character has had a species of bee named after his favorite catch phrase - Bazinga! On the TV show Cooper, who counts Stephen Hawking as his online friend,  uses the word to signal that he's just pulled a practical joke on somebody else. Brazilian biologist Andre Nemesio said he named the species of Brazilian orchid bee Euglossa bazinga in honor of 'the clever, funny, nerd character Sheldon Cooper,' because the bee had tricked scientists for some time with its similarity to other species. Scroll down for video . Bazinga! Dr Sheldon Cooper (played by actor Jim Parsons) has had a species of bee named after his Big Bang Theory catchphrase . Buzz word: A species of Brazilian orchid bee has been named Euglossa bazinga after the nerdy TV scientist character . Nemesio published his paper last month in Zootaxa, a journal for worldwide zoological taxonomists. He works at the Universidade Federal de Uberlândia in Brazil. Steven Molaro, one of the executive producers of The Big Bang Theory said on Wednesday that the CBS comedy is 'always extremely flattered when the science community embraces our show'. He said: 'Sheldon would be honored to know that Euglossa bazinga was inspired by him. In fact, after ''Mothra'' and griffins, bees are his third-favorite flying creatures.' The Big Bang Theory is a comedy about a group of brilliant but socially awkward scientists. It is one of the most popular comedies on U.S. television, attracting about 18 million viewers an episode. Busy bee: Brazilian biologist Andre Nemesio named his discovery in honor of the 'clever, funny, nerd' Sheldon . Geek patrol: The cast of hit TV show Big Bang Theory which attracts 18 million viewers an episode . Actor Jim Parsons has won two Emmys for his lead performance as Cooper. According to the Smithsonian, Sheldon Cooper has also an asteroid named after him (246247 Sheldoncooper). It's not just the quirky Sheldon Cooper who has been honored in the real world of science. In 2011, a mushroom hunter Dennis E. Desjardin named a species he found in the Borneo rainforest as Spongiforma squarepantsii - after the brightly-colored cartoon character. A field marine biologist at Arkansas State University Paul Sikkel named a small underwater parasite Gnathia marleyi after his idol, reggae musician Bob Marley. Other famous people with animal kingdom alter-egos include Beyonce's horse fly (Scaptia beyonceae) and Hugh Hefner's rabbit (Sylvilagus palustris hefneri). The former Republican hierarchy - George W. Bush, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld - all had beetles named in their honor in 2005. The Orchid Bee, also known as the gold bee, is a brightly-colored tropical bee of which there are more than 175 varieties. The are common in the western hemisphere throughout south and central America from Mexico to Argentina. The vividly-colored creatures, which have  green, blue, purple, gold and red hues, collect their nectar and pollen from orchids. They reach around one-inch in length but some have tongues which are twice the length of their body to drink nectar from tropical flowers. The little bees are known to fly around 30 miles in search of flowers which grow far apart and are particularly drawn to the fragrant oils of orchids. Orchid bees bury their nests, lined with resin, into cavities in wood, termite nests and the roofs of houses. Several individuals often live together across several generations. The Orchid bee is part of the larger group of Apidae which includes honey bees and bumble bees. Up to 24,000 new animal species are identified every year - with the scientists who discover them given the great honor of picking a name.

"Even the most hard-nosed of criminals didn't dare venture outside this record-breaking winter. According to official figures, Chicago recorded half as many murders in January 2014 as compared to the same month in 2013, with the weather most likely the cause. There were 11 days of subzero temperatures this January, making it one of the coldest months in recent history. Police have reported 20 killings in that time, according to The Chicago Sun-Times. Comparatively, in January 2013, 40 people were murdered. In January 2012, 38 people were killed and in January 2011, there 28 slayings. Big freeze: Chicago's record-low January temperatures are believed to be the cause of a 50 per cent drop in murders this year as compared with the same time last year. There were 20 killings in 2014 and 40 in 2013 . 'The superintendent has said weather is a factor, but its not the only factor,' Chicago Police spokesman Adam Collins told The Sun-Times. 'It neither causes nor prevents crime.' Nineteen of the 20 people killed were males, and the most common victim was a 19-year-old man. The youngest victim was 15-year-old Miguel Naverrette and the oldest was 44-year-old Edward Caridine. Eighteen of the 20 murders were shootings. In the other two, Stephanie Serrano was stabbed to death at a Jan. 6 party and Caridine was found beaten to death in his apartment Jan. 22, according autopsies performed by the medical examiner’s office. Three of the city’s 77 community areas had multiple murders in January. The Chicago Lawn community had the most killings with five. South Lawndale and Chatham also tallied multiple slayings with three and two, respectively. Record-lows: Official weather figures show the extent of this year's wintry January. The average temperature was 15.5 degrees, while there were 11 days of subzero temperatures . The decrease in murders came in one of the coldest January's in recent years. The average temperature in January 2014 was about 15.5 degrees — about 8.5 degrees colder than normal, according to the National Weather Service. The average temperature was about 26.5 degrees in January 2013 and about 30 degrees in January 2012 — nearly three to 6.5 degrees warmer than normal. Despite the colder temperature, Chicago still tallied a murder on 14 different days in January 2014 — including one on the coldest day of the month when the average temperature was minus-9 degrees. The city recorded 90 shootings and 98 shooting victims in January 2014 — the lowest total in the past four years, police said.

"Booksellers could soon have a secret weapon in the war against declining trade - the smell of chocolate. Researchers in Belgium have discovered that shoppers are more likely to take their time browsing and buy books from certain genres if a bookstore smells of chocolate. Scientists from the Hasselt University in eastern Belgium conducted a 10 day experiment in a general interest book shop. Sales boost: The smell of chocolate circulated around a bookstore made customers more likely to browse the store and take their time according to Belgian researchers . Sweet smell of success: The smell was circulated for around half the store's trading hours . The team dispersed a subtle smell of chocolate into the store that wasn't immediately noticeable to customers but strong enough so that it could be identified once pointed out. The smell was present in the store for around half of the store's opening hours and researchers found that customers were more likely to take their time in the store and talk to members of staff. The report, published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology, found specifically that 'customers were 2.22 times more likely to closely examine multiple books when the chocolate scent was present in store, compared with the control condition.' Shoppers were less likely to search out a particular book and more likely to browse the shelves. The scent also appeared to influence the genre of books customers bought. Taking their time: Customers were more likely to browse books when the chocolate scent was emitted than searching for a particular title . More than a fifth of books sold were either food and drink and romance novels or history books and crime thrilers. Sales in the first two categories rose by 40 per cent when the scent was dispersed, whereas sales in the second two categories increased by just over a fifth when the scent was absent. But the smell of chocolate seemed to move customers away from the history and crime thriller section. The report, which studied every fifth customer of the 201 who entered the store, concluded: 'Retailers can make use of pleasant ambient scents to improve the store environment, leading consumers to explore the store.'","Researchers in Belgium carried out a 10 day experiment in a bookstore .

"A schoolboy who bravely tackled a knife-wielding pupil who was threatening a classmate was punished because such heroic actions are strictly banned. Briar MacLean, 13, stepped in after he spotted an argument was quickly beginning to escalate between two boys at Sir John A. Macdonald school in Alberta, Canada. Suddenly one of the boys pulled out a knife and began to threaten the other turning an scuffle into a potentially deadly situation. Hero: Briar MacLean, 13, from Alberta, Canada, stands outside his school where he tackled a knife-wielding pupil - and was punished because such heroic actions are strictly forbidden . The heroic teenager charged and tackled the knife-brandishing youngster into a wall sending both attacker and knife falling to the floor. But for his bravery the pupil received not a commendation but a stern telling off from staff for ignoring school rules. According to the Calgary Board of Education, Briar should have left the scene to find a teacher - abandoning the unarmed student. Instead instincts kicked in and he chose to act - meaning there were no cuts, no stab wounds, and no need to call an ambulance. Briar said: 'He pulled out his flip knife so I came in and pushed him into the wall. 'It was just to help the other kid so he wouldn't get hurt.' Briar's reward for his bravery was a day in the school office, removed from the other students, and a stern lecture about not playing the hero. 'We've taught him to do the right thing': Briar with his mother Leah O'Donnell, who was furious when she learned her son was being disciplined for stepping in to help his classmate . His mother Leah O'Donnell was furious at the dressing down. She said: 'I received a call from the school vice-principal indicating there was an incident at the school and that my son had been involved. 'They my son was in trouble for being a part of it. 'They told him they don't condone heroics in the school and he wasn't allowed to go back to class for the day. Isn't that horrible? 'We've taught him to do the right thing and to step in - in our family we teach our children that they need to stand up for others and not run from danger out of self-preservation. 'When did we decide as a society to allow our children to grow up without spines? Without a decent sense of the difference between right and wrong? 'We're coddling kids and that doesn't make for strong individuals when they grow up - what are we teaching these children?' A spokeswoman for the Calgary Board of Education said details of the incident could not be discussed due to privacy regulations. But the Calgary Police Service confirmed they were called to the school where a student had pulled a knife while fighting with another, and a third boy had intervened to disarm the student. The student with the knife has apparently been suspended and police are still investigating, meaning charges have not been ruled out.","Briar MacLean, 13, stepped after seeing a fellow pupil pull a knife on another during argument at school .

"Faced with the devastating news her unborn child might not survive pregnancy, Robyn Wilson was advised to opt for an abortion. The 25-year-old was told at her first ultrasound scan it was highly likely her son had a serious, life-limiting illness, like Down's Syndrome. An appointment was booked for a termination. But just days before she was due to go through with the procedure, Mrs Wilson and her husband Adam, 26, decided against it. Robyn and Adam Wilson were advised to abort their unborn son after a 12-week scan revealed there was a chance he would be born with a life-limiting illness. Doctors warned baby Harry was unlikely to survive pregnancy and a termination appointment was booked . But the couple refused the abortion, and months later welcomed their healthy son, Harry, who is now about to celebrate his second birthday . Mrs Wilson said: 'We were told if the baby did live to birth, it might die shortly after, or that if it survived, it would be seriously ill or have health defects. There was still that slither of hope, but they advised us the best thing to do would be to have an abortion' They decided to carry on with their pregnancy and give their unborn child the best chance. Months later the couple were overjoyed when Mrs Wilson gave birth to a healthy baby boy, Harry. Mrs Wilson said she and her husband clung to a 'slither of hope' that their baby would survive. Now as she prepares to celebrate Harry's second birthday, she said: 'After being handed the results, we were told there was a very high chance our baby would die before birth. 'We were told if he did live to birth, he might die shortly after, or that if he survived, he would be seriously ill or have health defects. 'There was still that slither of hope but they told us advised us the best thing to do would be to have an termination. 'When we were advised to abort, everything was just rushing through my mind - I just kept thinking ""what would be worse having an abortion or having the baby in my arms for just a few minutes or days, maybe weeks?"". 'I thought I was never going to get that first hug, his first birthday party or that first day at school - let alone more. 'I thought it had all been taken away from me before it had even begun. But he's my best friend. I wouldn't change a thing. He's so perfect.' Miss Wilson, from Worksop, Nottinghamshire, was shocked to discover she was pregnant on January 23, 2012, shortly after starting a new job as a golf course supervisor. In spite of the difficult timing, the couple decided to continue with the pregnancy. Though Harry appeared to be fine when he was born, Mrs Wilson said she spent the first year of his life worrying he would suddenly be diagnosed with something . But she said she is now able to relax and enjoy Harry's second birthday - a milestone she never thought she'd get to enjoy . At their 12-week scan at Bassetlaw Royal Hospital on March 19, 2012, they were told  it was highly likely they had a Down's Syndrome baby and emergency blood tests were carried out the same day. The results revealed a heightened risk of Edward Syndrome or Patau Syndrome - both serious genetic disorders that limit life expectancy. Miss Wilson was referred to nearby Jessops Hospital, a maternity unit in Leeds, where she claims doctors advised her that her best option could be to terminate the pregnancy. She said: 'The hospital decided to book me in for an abortion to get rid of the baby - though they said it wasn't compulsory. 'The option was there and they advised that it could be for the best, as they were fairly certain something was going to be wrong with the baby. 'Adam and I were a complete mess, it's really not what we wanted to happen. 'We wanted to be telling people about the baby at this point - not finding ourselves unsure as to whether or not there would be a baby.' Doctors pencilled in a temporary abortion slot for March 26. Mss Wilson then underwent one final test, a CVS - a prenatal test to determine chromosomal abnormalities. And on March 23, just three days before the scheduled termination, the pair were shocked to discover results showed no problems with their unborn child. Despite medics insisting something must be wrong, heart and diaphragm scans appeared to show no obvious illnesses or deformities. She said: 'He was absolutely perfect when he was born.

"A married Premier League footballer who already has three children by his wife and mistress has just taken a second bride in his native Cote'Ivoire. Cheick Tiote, 28, who earns £45,000 a week playing for Newcastle United, reportedly wed Laeticia Doukrou in a traditional ceremony earlier this month, saying taking another wife was 'nothing unusual' given he is a Muslim. But news of the second wedding came as a surprise to his first wife, Madah, 25, who is said to have only found out about it  on Facebook.  Madah, who lives with Tiote and their two children in a £1.5million house in a village outside Newcastle, reportedly fainted with shock when she saw the photographs of her husband marrying another woman. Meanwhile the midfielder also has a one-year-old child with mistress, 33-year-old Zimbabwean Nkosiphile Mpofu, known as Nikki. Scroll down for video . Wife Number 1: Newcastle United star Cheick Tiote, with first wife Madah, is said to have taken a second bride . Wife Number 2: Midfielder Tiote, 28, who is a Muslim, has married Doukrou Laeticia in his native Ivory Coast . And the mistress: Nkosiphile Mpofu, known as Nikki, has a son, Rafael Tiote, by the footballer from Cote d'Ivoire . His agent today confirmed reports he had got married for a second time. Jean Musampa said: 'I can say that he did get married and that it is his second marriage. 'This is nothing unusual. He is a Muslim.' The footballer, who can have four wives under Islamic law, is also said to have insisted to friends that having several partners is commonplace in his native Ivory Coast. A source told The Sun: 'He doesn't see a problem with having two wives. 'It's perfectly acceptable in his culture. He doesn't see he has done anything wrong and doesn't know what the fuss is all about.' But his first wife, Madah, is said to have felt rather differently. According to Ivorian news website iMatin, Madah wasn't aware of her husband taking a second wife, and found out about it through social media. They reported that she fainted when she saw the photos of her husband marrying another woman - whose name she did not know - on Facebook. Home: Tiote lives in a large stone farmhouse in a picturesque village near Newcastle popular with footballers . Newcastle United's Cheick Tiote reportedly says he 'doesn't know what the fuss is all about'. Right, the footballer appears in court in Newcastle last year charged with string of motoring offences . The first Mrs Tiote is now said to have forgiven her husband, but his 33-year-old Zimbabwean mistress, Ms Mpofu, is believed to have recently ended her three-year affair with the footballer after he allegedly promised to make her his wife. While she was said to have been 'comfortable' with his being married, she apparently decided to call the relationship off because he 'used me like a mop'. Ms Mpofu was pictured earlier this week leaving a Waitrose store in the village where Tiote lives with his family, with her son by the footballer, Rafael. Newcastle United was not available for comment. Tiote received interest from Lokomotiv Moscow during the summer and was thought to be keen on a move to Russia. He remained on Tyneside after Lokomotiv failed to make an acceptable offer, but his contract is set to expire in 2016. South African President Jacob Zuma has four wives . Polygamy was abolished in the Ivory Coast in 1964. The West African country is one of few African countries to have outlawed the practice, which in theory is punishable by a fine or a jail term of up to three years. The practice of men having more than one wife has been blamed as a factor in spiralling rates of HIV in African women. But men cling tenaciously to what they see as their 'right', whatever the law says. Local customs as well as Islam permit a man to have more than one wife, and it is still common practice among Cote d'Ivoire's population of 22million. Polygamy tends to be more prevalent among the animist (a form of spiritualism) and the Muslim communities. Under Sharia law, polygamy is completely legitimate as Muslim men are permitted to take up to four wives. In Senegal it was reported that nearly 47 per cent of marriages feature multiple women. South African President Jacob Zuma has four wives and is a vocal supporter of polygamy. It is legal in South Africa, Egypt, Eritrea, Morocco and Malaysia. In Iran and Libya it is legal with the written consent of the first wife. In other places it is illegal but the law is rarely, if ever, enforced. Some anthropologists believe that polygamy has been the norm throughout human history. In 2003, New Scientist magazine reported that, until 10,000 years ago, most children were fathered by a comparatively small number of men. Polygamous marriages may not be performed in the United Kingdom, and if a polygamous marriage is performed, the already-married person may be guilty of the crime of bigamy. Polygamous marriages legally performed in another country where the law allows it are not recognised for pension, immigration or citizenship purposes in the UK. It has been estimated that there are as many as 20,000 polygamous Muslim marriages in the UK. In October 2013 Tiote was lucky to avoid prison after admitting to possessing a fake driving licence, for which he was given a seven-month suspended sentence and 180 hours of unpaid community work. Judge James Goss said Tiote, 27, avoided jail only because he pleaded guilty and added: 'I have no doubt that, using your considerable talent, you will be able to assist others in the community by encouraging them and passing on your skills that way.' The Ivorian had to be called back to court after prosecutors forgot he should have been banned from driving after accumulating 12 points.","Newcastle United's Cheick Tiote, 28, has taken a second wife in Ivory Coast .

"Swimsuit designer Sylvie Cachay had a cocktail of drugs in her system that could have contributed to her tragic death in the bathtub of a Manhattan hotel, according to a forensic pathologist. Cachay's boyfriend, Nicholas Brooks, has been charged with strangling and drowning her to death at the upscale Soho House. But in a pretrial hearing in Manhattan Supreme Court on Wednesday, forensic pathologist Gerard Catanese revealed evidence that would support Brooks' innocence. He said there were anti-depressants, sedatives and muscle relaxers in Cachay's system at the time of her death. Brutally murdered: Sylvie Cachay, 33, was found strangled in a bathtub at the Soho Hotel in Manhattan on December 9, 2010 . 'That combination of drugs could . account for her falling asleep, losing consciousness, passing out and . sinking under the water and ultimately dying,' he said, according to the New York Daily News. The information counters the findings of an autopsy that ruled her death a homicide by strangulation and drowning. Party lifestyle: Brooks is on trial for the murder of his girlfriend at the trendy hotel in the Meatpacking District in 2010 . Cachay, 33, was found half-clothed and face up in a bathtub at the Soho House hotel at 3 a.m. on December 9, 2010. In the hours after Miss Cachay was . found, Brooks, 27,  gave several statements to New York police that . could be used against him in court. He told police that he had had left his girlfriend at the hotel to go out drinking the night of her death and that she was sleeping - not taking a bath - when he left. Several minutes after he was seen leaving on the hotel's surveillance cameras, guests began to complain about water leaking through the ceiling from the couple's room upstairs. It is unclear whether other statements he made after he was arrested - including asking an officer 'How much could I get for something like this' - will be allowed at trial. Miss Cachay's mother Sylvia told the Post: 'We realize we are going to see justice, and I am sure New York justice is going to be in our favor.' Miss Cachay, whose designs have been worn by a string of celebrities, was known to have a volatile relationship with Brooks, who was 25 at the time of her death. According to investigators, she had red marks around her neck and a bite mark on her hand when her body was found. It was later discovered that on the eve of her tragic death, Miss . Cachay sent a message to Brooks with 'F*** . you' written in the title field. Beauty: Sylvie Cachay had a successful career as a designer and led a glamorous life in Manhattan when she was brutally killed . The expletive-laden email accused Brooks of stealing from her credit card and threatening to go to police, it has been claimed. Brooks is the son of late Oscar-winning composer and alleged sex attacker Joseph Brooks. 'The subject line was ""F*** you,"" and it said she was going to the police, and that’s relevant,' prosecutor Jordan Arnold told a court as he argued that the District Attorney did nothing wrong in plundering Brooks' email account for clues. Justice . Wittner agreed that it would be in the public interest to . disclose the contents of his emails to a jury. But Brooks' defence lawyer Jeffrey Hoffman told the New York Post that the . email is inadmissible, adding: 'This is nothing more than a given . feeling at a given moment that was different two moments before and two . moments after.' Awaiting trial: Nicholas Brooks, 27, the son of Oscar-winning composer Joseph Brooks, stands trial accused of murder . Celebrated designer: Miss Cahchay's designs have been worn by a string of celebrities . On the night of her death, Miss Cachay and Brooks checked . into the hotel after a fire in her apartment. Police allege Brooks left . her there to die while he went to party. Ms Cachay lived in an apartment in Manhattan's West Village and had a membership at the Soho House, an elite club and hotel that has hosted such stars as Nicole Kidman, Victoria Beckham and Naomi Watts. She made swimsuits for Victoria’s Secret, Tommy Hilfiger, Marc Jacobs and Syla, her own label. Brooks’ father, Joseph, who won an Oscar for the 1977 hit 'You Light Up My Life,' committed suicide in 2011 amid multiple charges of sexual assault. Grim find: Sylvie Cachay's body is removed from Soho House hotel after its discovery in December 2010 . Plush: Soho House Hotel is one of New York's most exclusive members' clubs known for its lavish bedrooms . He was charged with 91 counts of rape, sexual abuse, criminal sexual acts, assault, and other crimes. However, he committed suicide before his case or his son's could go to trial. The elder Brooks left no money to his children and was nearly broke when he died, the New York Post reported. It's unclear whether the proceeds of his biggest hit, which still rakes in royalties, will go to his son. Brooks is facing 25 years to life in prison, if convicted.","Sylvie Cachay, 33, found face up in bath at the Soho House hotel in 2011 .

"Future wars could be fought entirely on the internet, the Defence Secretary Philip Hammond claimed today. The Cabinet Minister said military technology was changing rapidly with 'cyber' warfare the battleground of the future. He told a Westminster gathering that internet-based attacks could replace boots on the ground - in the same way tanks replaced horses in the 20th Century. The Call of Duty video game is hugely popular - but could become a reality in the future. While cyber warfare will have nothing to do with video shoot 'em ups, malicious computer viruses are likely to be the new weapon of choice for Western countries that are unwilling to risk their soldiers lives on a real battlefield . Mr Hammond said the internet was the 'new frontier' for the military because the public was no longer prepared to accept British soldiers being killed on the front line. He said: ‘I can tell you with some degree of confidence that there will never again be a conflict in which cyber does not play a major role.' Mr Hammond said this would either be in the form of background support for the 'conventional application of force'. But it was 'possible to envisage entire conflicts being fought in cyberspace', Mr Hammond said. ‘The vulnerability that modern societies, modern militaries have to networked IT systems makes this inevitable and makes our exposure all the more significant,' he said. The Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said all conflicts in the future would have an element of cyber warfare . ‘There is a remarkable alignment amongst military chiefs about where we need to invest. 'We need to invest in cyber; we need to invest in intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance. ‘In . modern warfare, we need to know where our targets are – our public does . not tolerate collateral damage or, allow me another piece of jargon, . “civ caz” any longer.’ Mr Hammond said 'military capability' could only be measured against other countries' armies. He said: 'We can’t stand still because our enemies don’t stand still. We have to evolve, we have to change how we deliver military effect all the time. ‘So while looking back to our proud military traditions, we always have to be prepared to embrace the future. ‘At the time of the First World War it was moving from horses to tanks; in the late 19th Century it was the debate about whether the machine gun would ever catch on. ‘The frontier now is around cyber; the investment that we are making in cyber.’ Cyber warfare's potential was exposed in the suspected Israel assault on Iran's nuclear weapons programme in 2010. A computer virus called Stuxnet - allegedly designed by Israel in collaboration with the US - infected Iran's top-security Natanz uranium enrichment site. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad admitted the virus had set back his country's nuclear ambitions. The Stuxnet virus worked by increasing the speed of uranium centrifuges to breaking point. At the same time it shut off safety monitoring systems, hoodwinking operators that all was normal.","Philip Hammond says internet warfare is next military 'frontier'

"Women in Afghanistan were brutally repressed under Taliban rule from 1996 to 2001 – but a series of fascinating old photographs show how women there used to live freely. The Taliban were condemned around the world for their treatment of women. Under their rule they were forbidden to be educated, publicly beaten for showing disobedience and forced to wear burqas – a garment that covers the whole body, apart from the eyes. Women browse in a Kabul record store . Women in a biology class at Kabul University . However, Mohammad Humayon Qayoumi, who was born in Kabul in Afghanistan, and went on to become an engineering professor at San Jose State University, wrote a photo-essay book called Once Upon A Time in Afghanistan that documented how life before the Taliban used to be very different for women. His photographs from the 1950s, 60s and 70s show how they used to be afforded university-level education, browse record shops in short skirts and study science. Indeed a State Department report from the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor from 2001 explains how women were given the vote in the 1920s, were granted equality in the Afghan constitution in the 1960s and by the early 1990s formed 70 per cent of school teachers, 50 per cent of government workers and in Kabul, 40 per cent of doctors.

Mr Qayoumi said: ‘Remembering Afghanistan’s hopeful past only makes its present misery seem more tragic. But it is important to know that disorder, terrorism, and violence against schools that educate girls are not inevitable. I want to show Afghanistan’s youth of today how their parents and grandparents really lived.’ Afghanistan’s president Hamid Karzai recently endorsed a code of conduct that would prohibit many of the scenes shown in these photographs. It states that women are not allowed to travel without a male guardian and must not mingle with strange men in public places such as schools, markets and offices.

"More than 14,000 students who are predicted to get top grades at A-Level have been turned down by Oxford and Cambridge this year as competition for places has increased. The universities are having to reject more than expected after hundreds of extra students applied to study there from September. Cambridge has received 16,145 applications - 450 more than last year but will only make offers to  4,138 of those. Pressure: An increase in applications by top students means Cambridge (pictured) and Oxford will turn down more people this year . Oxford is still calculating its figures for 2013, but said it will be similar or slightly higher than the 17,241 from last year, where  3.233 had acceptances. Nearly all people from the UK who apply for Oxbridge will be predicted to get at least three A's at A-Level. 'The university seeks the ablest and best-qualified students with the . greatest potential from every background and every part of the UK,' a spokesman for Cambridge University told the Independent. 'Admissions decisions are based on students’ ability, commitment and . their potential to achieve.  The success rate of suitably qualified . applicants is broadly the same regardless of where in the UK they are . from. 'Our outreach goal is to ensure that any student with the ability, . passion and commitment to apply to Cambridge has a clear picture of what . the university can offer them and receives all the support necessary . for them to best demonstrate their potential.' Figures show that applications to all Britain universities are up overall. The . Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) said in June there were 637, 500 applications, up from 618, 250 a year earlier. Universities are charging up to £9,000 a year in fees and up to £35,000 for foreign students. Competition: Despite being expected to get top grades at A-Level thousands will as usual be disappointed this year . But poor teenagers are still almost half as likely to go to university than richer classmates, official figures suggest. Around a fifth of 15-year-olds receiving free school meals (FSM) - a key measure of poverty - went on to higher education in 2010/11, compared with more than a third of those not getting the dinners, according to statistics published by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). The data also shows that privately educated youngsters are more likely to study for a degree, and to go to the most selective universities, than state school peers. It comes amid continuing efforts to encourage more poorer teenagers to consider going into higher education, and increasing investment by universities in the area. The latest figures show that 20 per cent of pupils who were receiving free dinners at age 15 were in higher education by the time they were 19, compared with 38 per cent of non-FSM students - an 18 per cent gap. The numbers of FSM pupils going to university has risen - in 2005/06 13 per cent went on to study for a degree compared with 33 per cent of other pupils - a 19 per cent gap. Universities are planning to spend more than £700 million in 2017/18 on recruiting poorer students and those less likely to apply - an increase of more than £100 million from 2012/13, a BIS spokeswoman said.","Oxford and Cambridge have higher reject total as more have applied .
Overall applications to UK universities also up despite £9,000 a year fees ."
"Tony Blair, pictured, promised to make education his priority but his government's huge increase in spending actually led to 'no improvement in student learning outcomes' Billions of pounds poured into education under Labour resulted in ‘no improvements’ in standards, a major report revealed yesterday. Despite Tony Blair declaring his priorities as ‘education, education, education’ when he swept to power in 1997, a huge increase in spending on schools led to ‘no improvement in student learning outcomes’, the report found. In fact, the UK’s teenagers have slipped down world league tables in crucial subjects while the country’s schools have become among the most socially segregated across the world. Britain’s immigrant children are clustered in the most disadvantaged schools, the report found. Eighty per cent of students with an . immigrant background attend schools with a ‘high concentration’ of . children from similar families. Only Mexico, Estonia and Finland have . higher levels, a study of 34 countries by the Organisation for Economic . Co-operation and Development (OECD) found. Primary school class sizes are bigger only in Turkey, Korea, Japan, Israel and Chile and rising numbers of young people have become Neets, ‘not in education, employment or training’. The findings are a damning indictment of the former Labour government, suggesting their education policies have had little impact and taxpayers have failed to get value for money. They come just a day after the National Union of Teachers and the NASUWT announced a ‘work to rule’, with staff sticking rigidly to six-and-a-half hour days, refusing all non-teaching duties and threatening strikes. The OECD study – Education at a Glance – found that expenditure on UK primary and secondary schools and colleges as a percentage of GDP increased from 3.6 per cent in 1995 to 4.5 per cent in 2009, higher than the OECD average of 4.0 per cent. At the same time, there has been ‘no improvement in student learning outcomes’, the report says. Andreas Schleicher, deputy director for education at the OECD, said: ‘Spending in the UK has gone up really a lot and has not been reflected in changes to [exam] scores. You have seen huge effort on the part of Government and at the same time outcomes have been flat.’ Separate figures released by the Office for National Statistics have shown that Labour’s spending on education rose from £35.3billion in 2000 to £63.9billion in 2009. The OECD monitors standards by administering its own tests in reading, maths and science for hundreds of thousands of 15-year-olds in up to 70 countries every three years. The most recent results in 2010 revealed that the UK fell from 24th to 28th position in maths, 14th to 16th in science and 17th to 25th in reading. The average class size in primary schools in 2010 was 25.8 pupils – above the OECD average of 21.3. Failings: The report found that primary school class sizes are bigger only in Turkey, Korea, Japan, Israel and Chile . Meanwhile, the social make-up of UK schools poses ‘significant challenges’ for immigrant students and those from disadvantaged backgrounds, according to the OECD. Some 79.8 per cent of immigrant students whose mothers are poorly educated – not achieving any qualifications beyond GCSE level – are concentrated in disadvantaged schools. This is a higher proportion than any other OECD country. The average level is 55.9 per cent. However, the situation is not limited to children with poorly educated mothers. Some 42.5 per cent of immigrant students born to highly educated mothers – those who have a degree – are in disadvantaged schools. This is also a higher proportion than any other country examined by researchers, with the average being 26.1 per cent. These figures relate to 2009. Tory MP Chris Skidmore said yesterday: ‘Labour’s answer to falling educational standards was to throw more and more money at the problem. ‘This evidence demolishes that approach once and for all. It’s not how much you spend that counts, but what you spend it on.'","UK's teenagers slipped down world league tables in crucial subjects .

"Twitter users are inadvertently revealing their location in updates on the social media channel, an expert claims. A study that sampled more than 15 million tweets, found that one in five updates give away a user's whereabouts, which could present unwelcome opportunities for criminals. The research provides important factual data for a growing conversation about online privacy and third-party commercial or . government use of geo-tagged information. This heat map shows the density of all tweets during the study collection period where the location was identifiable through ambient information or direct sharing . The University of Southern California (USC) study, which was published in the International Journal of Geoinformatics used a custom-built app to examine how many people willingly and accidentally publicise their presence on Twitter. Lead author Chris Weidemann, a graduate . student in the Geographic Information Science and Technology (GIST) online master's program at USC, said: 'I'm a pretty private person, and I wish others would be more cautious with the types of information they share.' 'There are all sorts of information that can be gleaned from things outside of the tweet itself.' Twitter has approximately 500 million active users, who are expected to tweet 72 billion times in 2013. Reports have shown that about 6 per cent of users opt-in to allow the platform to broadcast their location with every tweet. But that's only part of the footprint Twitter users leave, and even users who do not willingly 'tag' their location, they may be inadvertently revealing where they are, the study shows. Twitter has approximately 500 million active users, who are expected to tweet 72 billion times in 2013. Reports have shown that about 6 per cent of users opt-in to allow the platform to broadcast their location with every tweet . To get a fuller sense of what publicly accessible data might reveal about Twitter users, Mr Weidemann developed an app called Twitter2GIS, to analyse the metadata collected by Twitter, including details about the user's hometown, time zone and language. The data, generated by Twitter users and publicly available through Twitter's application programming interface (API) and Google's Geocoding API, was then processed by a software program, which mapped and analysed the data, searching for trends. During the one-week sampling period of the study, roughly 20 per cent of the tweets collected showed the user's location to an accuracy of street level or better. Many Twitter users divulged their physical location directly through active location monitoring or GPS coordinates. But another two per cent of all tweets – equating to about 4.4 million tweets a day – provided so-called 'ambient' location data, where the user might not be aware that they are divulging their location. Mr Weidemann said: 'The downside is that mining this kind of information can also provide opportunities for criminal misuse of data. 'My intent is to educate social media users and inform the public about their privacy.' An increasing number of social media platforms (pictured) allow users to share their location. During the one-week sampling period of the study, roughly 20 per cent of the tweets collected showed the user's location to an accuracy of street level or better . In addition to being a graduate student at USC, Weidemann works for a company that builds geographic information systems for the federal government. He initially developed Twitter2GIS as part of a project for a course taught by Jennifer Swift, associate professor of spatial sciences, who said the app 'will help create an awareness among the general population about the information they divulge.' Weidemann is a self-described 'conservative' Twitter user, using the social media channel infrequently and has the privacy set to not share any location information about his tweets. Still, in the course of doing this study, he turned Twitter2GIS on his own account and was surprised at the specificity the application was able to find about his location, based on a hashtag he used about an academic conference. 'This research has been fun and a little scary,' he said.","A U.S. scientist found 20% of the tweets collected showed the user's location to an accuracy of street level or better .

"Abolishing GCSEs: Education Secretary Michael Gove is to axe 'dumbed-down' exams and bring back a tough new O-level style system . Michael Gove is to herald an end to a quarter of a century of ‘dumbed-down’ exams this week when he abolishes GCSEs and brings back a tough new O-level style system. The Education Secretary will announce the new exams on Tuesday in a joint press conference with Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg after a furious behind-the-scenes row between the two men. Mr Clegg has forced Mr Gove to delay the new system until September 2015, which means Labour could scrap it if they win the next Election, due in May 2015. But Mr Gove won his battle to ensure the new exams are more rigorous and that the top grades only go to the brightest children. The joint appearance on Tuesday is designed to counter claims of another Coalition rift. The reforms are designed to help schools in England catch up with other countries which have left us trailing in school standards. The new exams, dubbed ‘Gove- levels’, follow claims that GCSEs, which replaced O-levels in 1986, are too easy. Under Mr Gove’s shake-up, the current system whereby nearly three in ten pupils get A or A* grades will go. Instead as few as one in ten will get the top mark, Grade 1. Marks will depend on a traditional ‘all or nothing’ three-hour exam at the end of the two-year course, rather than the current system in which up to half the grading is based on modules and continual assessment, followed by a 90-minute exam at the end. Pupils will no longer be able to bump up their grades with endless re-sits of each exam module. In future they will have to re-sit the entire exam, which is expected to deter most. There will be more complex algebra questions in maths exams and a return to essays in English literature exams instead of trendy GCSE ‘bite sized’ answers. Catch up: The new exams are more rigorous and top grades will only go to the brightest children in an attempt to help English schools catch up with other countries as we trail in school standards . And in a controversial move designed to . counter claims that GCSEs are far too easy for bright pupils, questions . in the new exam will be graded, starting with easy questions and . building up to difficult questions which will stretch the cleverest . pupils. It means that less able pupils may be unable to complete the paper. But Mr Gove will argue it is vital to boost standards. In addition, the new exams will be run by a single exam board following complaints that competition between rival boards is driving down standards. Board officials have been accused of boasting how easy their exams are, and giving tips to teachers on the content of papers. Ministers said the current rules had created a ‘race to the bottom’ in standards. Mr Gove will announce the reforms with Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, pictured, on Tuesday after a furious row between them forced Mr Gove to delay the new system until 2015 . According to a 2010 OECD study of . 15-year-olds, the UK fell from 17th to 25th for reading, 24th to 28th . for maths and 14th to 16th in science over a three-year period. Mr Clegg was furious earlier this year when Mr Gove suggested replacing GCSEs with a two-tier exam, with a new version of O-levels for top pupils and a new version of CSEs, also abolished in 1986, for less able youngsters. Mr Clegg accused Mr Gove of acting in an ‘insulting and patronising’ manner by failing to consult him in advance. 'Schools will be given time to up their game' Mr Clegg’s main objection was that this system would be ‘elitist’ and would ‘stigmatise’ children considered not bright enough. The two men thrashed out their differences in a series of meetings over the summer. Mr Gove won his battle to ensure the exams can test so-called ‘elite’ pupils. However, Coalition insiders say there could be further Tory-Lib Dem friction as details of the new single tier exam emerge. ‘Gove is determined to ensure it is much more demanding than the existing exam,’ said one source. ‘Schools will be given time to raise their game and adjust to that. If they can’t, or decide their pupils simply aren’t up to taking the new exam they may be forced to find a different option. That could reopen the debate about having another, less difficult exam.’ Falling standards: The UK fell from 17th to 25th for reading, 24th to 28th for maths and 14th to 16th in science, according to a 2010 OECD study of 15-year-olds . Mr Clegg persuaded Mr Gove to delay starting the new exams until September 2015, arguing that a 2014 deadline would cause chaos in schools. It was a blow to Mr Gove who had hoped to show the system was up and running before the next Election. Furthermore, the 2015 start date – with the first new exams in 2017 – means that, in theory, if Ed Miliband wins the next Election, the new exams could be scrapped weeks before they are due to begin. It is certain to put education at the heart of the next Election campaign.When Mr Gove first floated his ideas of a two-tier exam system, Labour education spokesman Stephen Twigg called it ‘a cap on aspiration’ and accused Mr Gove of ‘harking back to a nostalgic view of the past’. The new proposals are also expected to run into fierce opposition from teaching unions who claim they could ‘lower aspirations and exacerbate inequalities in society’. Tuesday’s announcement is a key moment in the fast-rising political career of former journalist Mr Gove, brought up by adoptive parents and partly state-educated. A growing number of Tories believe he is a contender to succeed David Cameron as Tory leader, though Mr Gove has laughed off such reports, offering to ‘sign a parchment in my own blood to prove I do not want to be Prime Minister’. NOW Tens of thousands of pupils can bump up grades by re-sitting parts of the GCSE exams until they get a pass.IN FUTURE Partial resits will end. Pupils will be forced to resit the entire exam. NOW Final exam can be as short as 90 minutes IN FUTURE Three-hour exams. NOW Maths exams have little algebra, English exams include ‘bite sized’ replies and rigorous English-to-foreign-language translations are rare.IN FUTURE More algebra in maths exams, more full length essays in English and a return to full English-to-foreign-language translation tests. NOW Up to 50 per cent of exams are studied via modules and continual assessment.IN FUTURE Replaced by one exam at end of two-year course. NOW Technically, everyone who gets a grade from A to G grade is deemed to have achieved  a ‘pass’.IN FUTURE New 1 to 6 pass grade, 7 onwards will be fail. NOW 22 per cent get A or A* grade. Around seven per cent of all candidates gain an A*. IN FUTURE As few as five per cent may get Grade 1.","Education Secretary Michael Gove will announce the new exams on Tuesday .

"A community stalwart with an MBE has been spared jail after claiming more than £23,000 of taxpayers' money by lying about his savings. Former magistrate Rahmat Ali Raja, 75, dishonestly claimed pension credits and council tax reductions for 10 years - despite, at one point, having more than £102,000 across nine bank accounts. But the retired charity director, who was also a local councillor in Pendle, Lancashire, was yesterday spared jail for his crimes. Guilty: Rahmat Ali Raja, 75, was yesterday spared jail for falsely claiming more than £23,000 in benefits. The former magistrate and local councillor was awarded an MBE in 2005 . Speaking after the hearing, Raja, originally from Gujarat, Pakistan, said: 'I am very sorry. I made a mistake.' Raja, who has already paid the amounts . back in full, was handed a 24-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months. He pleaded guilty to two counts of dishonestly failing to . disclose information to make a gain for self, and one count of . dishonestly making a false statement to obtain a benefit. Preston Magistrates' Court heard that, between October 2003 and September 2013, Raja told the Department for Work and Pensions he was retired and had just £5,601 in savings. He wrongly claimed £11,379 in the process. Dishonest: The retired charity director received pension credits and council tax reductions for 10 years . Raja also failed to declare his real savings to Pendle Council in November 2004, allowing him to wrongly claim £11,898 between October 2003 and March 2013. John Abbott, prosecuting, told the court how Raja would receive the payments into his Halifax bank account via automatic credit transfer. He said: 'Evidence has now become available that he had £83,000 on October 6, 2003 which was not disclosed at the time. Had the true facts been known, there would have been an effect on his benefits.' In 2009, Raja claimed he only had one bank account, which he shared with his wife. But Mr Abbott said: 'He had nine other accounts in his and his wife’s names and agrees they were there when he made the original claims for pension credit. He denied acting dishonestly and said he made a mistake.' John Wishart, defending, said: 'First of all, the guidelines make it clear that a large sum of money can be accumulated over a long period of time, as in this case. 'Of considerable mitigation is that the money was instantly repaid in full. The final payment was made in September last year.' He added that the ‘highest recorded amount’ in Raja’s savings at any one time was ‘a little over £102,000’. He added that although these accounts were in his name, they were shared by many members of Raja’s family. Sparing Raja jail, chairman of the bench Kathleen Strickland said his offences had been aggravated because he 'committed the fraud from the outset’. But she said Raja’s age, early guilty plea, full repayment and ill health prevented her from handing out an immediate custodial sentence. As well as his suspended jail sentence, which could be activated it he re-offends within 12 months, Raja must pay court costs of £85 and a £75 victim surcharge. Mrs Strickland said: “If you break this condition it could be very serious for you.” Spared jail: Raja, the former director of a community development trust, was handed a 24-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, at Preston Magistrates' Court . Raja was chosen to receive an MBE through his work as a former director of the Ithaad Community Development Trust in Nelson, which provided help and advice to those who needed it. Speaking after the case, he said: “I am very sorry. I made a mistake. All along I have said it’s my family’s money and my children’s money. “I filled out the forms but I did them wrong. My memory is not good and I am sorry.”","Rahmat Ali Raja, 75, dishonestly claimed benefits for 10 years .

"A sperm donor said today that he would not have donated to a lesbian couple had he known the huge financial responsibility that has now fallen to him. William Marotta fathered a child with Angela Bauer, 40, and partner Jennifer Schreiner, 34, who found him via Craigslist three years ago. The three signed a legal document which . stated Mr Marotta, a married mechanic who fosters children with his . wife, would have no rights to the child. However now the state of Kansas is demanding Mr Marotta pay $6,000 in child support after the lesbian couple were forced onto welfare when Ms Bauer lost her job. Second thoughts: William Marotta, who acted as a sperm donor for a lesbian couple in 2009 and gave up parental rights, is being chased by Kansas State for $6,000 in child support . Backing: Angela Bauer said today that Mr Marotta had her complete support in fighting the state department and that she and her former partner Jennifer Schreiner were eternally grateful to him for giving them a daughter . Mr Marotta wanted to help the couple and along with his wife Kimberly turned down their payment of $50 to donate his sperm for free. He told the Today show: 'If you are two women, it's difficult without a man there, so I donated.' He added: 'No good deed goes unpunished.' Mr Marotta said that he would likely never have donated his sperm if he had known the financial burden. His wife Kimberly added: 'This is not at all what we signed up for.' Marotta is asking that the case be dismissed, arguing that he is not the child's legal father. A hearing is set for January 8. The mechanic applied to the ad in 2009 after Bauer wrote: 'We are foster and adoptive parents and . now we desire to share a pregnancy and birth together.' Mr Marotta provided sperm which was . used for artificial insemination by her partner, Ms Schreiner. In . return, he gave up parental rights including financial duties for the . child. Ms Bauer also spoke . to the Today show on Thursday about her gratitude to Mr Marotta and how . they supported him in his fight against Kansas state. She said: 'We never intended for him [Marotta] to support her. That's our responsibility we have as her parents. I have the joy of raising her and loving her and it's only because of William.' United: Ms Bauer and Ms Schreiner celebrating their same-sex union. The couple adopted eight children together during their relationship but have not been given the same rights as straight couples . Battle: Angela Bauer and former partner Jennifer Schreiner (right) are supporting their sperm donor William Marotta in his fight against paying child support for their daughter . Kansas Department for Children and Families spokeswoman Angela de Rocha said on Wednesday that when a single mother seeks benefits for a child, the department routinely tries to determine the child's paternity and require the father to make support payments to lessen the potential cost to taxpayers. She argued that the law regarding artificial insemination is an incentive for donors and prospective mothers to work with a doctor. 'I believe that is the intent of the law, so that we don't end up with these ambiguous situations,' she said. Bauer and Schreiner updated Marotta on their daughter's well-being occasionally but he has had little contact, according to the Kansas City Star. The arrangement changed earlier this year when Ms Schreiner, the only parent registered on her daughter's birth certificate, applied for social welfare. Ms Bauer had been supporting the child but was left unable to work due to ill health. On October 3, 2012, attorney Mark McMillan filed a petition on behalf of the Department of Children and Families seeking a ruling that Marotta is the father of Schreiner's child and owes a duty to support her. It said the department provided cash assistance totaling $189 for the girl for July through September 2012, and had paid medical expenses totaling nearly $6,000. Schreiner had allegedly been put under pressure to reveal Mr Marotta's name so that her daughter could continue to have health care. The legal agreement that the three made in 2009 was deemed invalid by Kansas state because they did not use a certified doctor for the insemination. It may appear unconventional but searching for sperm donors on Craigslist is not unheard of. In 2010, the popular cafemom blog lit up in outrage after a man from Beaverton, Oregon advertised his sperm donor services on Craigslist. He wrote: 'I'm ready to help. We'd be very discreet, no one needs to know.' Another ad for a potential donor in San Diego read: 'I'm not offering thrilling risky sex, just pregnancy.' Craigslist requires that users agree to guidelines when posting ads for services. However the site 'does not control, is not responsible for and makes no representations or warranties with respect to any user content... You must conduct any necessary, appropriate, prudent or judicious investigation, inquiry, research and due diligence with respect to any user content'. Among the long list of banned items on Craigslist are illegal goods; offensive material including porn and anything deemed malicious or fraudulent. There is no mention of sperm donors. Ms Bauer and Ms Schreiner, who separated in 2010, plan to help Mr Marotta fight the state's decision. Hannah Schroller, Mr Marotta's attorney, argued that the case was consistent with a 2007 case in which the Kansas Supreme Court denied parental rights to a man who sought them after providing a sperm donation under similar circumstances. A licensed physician performed the insemination in the 2007 case. Schroller wrote that Marotta took the same actions as the man in the 2007 case did, and he - like that man - should be considered a sperm donor, not a father. She stressed that sperm banks regularly ship donations for the intended purpose of artificial insemination within the United States and abroad to both residential and medical facility addresses. Schroller argued in court documents that if a donor is free of parental responsibility only when a doctor performs an insemination, 'then any woman in Kansas could have sperm donations shipped to her house, inseminate herself without a licensed physician and seek out the donor for financial support because her actions made him a father, not a sperm donor. 'This goes against the very purpose of the statute to protect sperm donors as well as birth mothers'. Ms Bauer and Ms Schreiner had been together for eight years and adopted eight children. They ended their relationship in 2010 but continue to co-parent their . sons and daughters who range from three months to 25 years old. The . state of Kansas does not recognize same-sex unions, so each of their . children was registered for adoption by a single parent. A motion to dismiss the state's case will be heard in Shawnee County District Court on January 8. Moving on: Jennifer Schreiner posted this picture with a man believed to be her new partner since the end of her relationship with Angela Bauer .","Angela Bauer, 40, and partner Jennifer Schreiner, 34, placed ad in 2009 .

"A tiny wooden hut where one of Britain's best-loved nature authors penned some of his greatest works is today up for sale - after lying untouched for nearly 40 years. Henry William Williamson built the remote moorland cabin in 1929 with the profits from his most famous book, Tarka the Otter. Williamson, a naturalist, farmer and prolific writer, spent up to 15 hours a day inside the one-room hideaway working on his acclaimed natural history and social history novels. For sale: This tiny wooden hut, where one of Britain's best-loved nature authors penned some of his greatest works is today up for sale - after lying untouched for nearly 40 years . Immaculate: Henry William Williamson,a naturalist, farmer and prolific writer, spent up to 15 hours a day inside the one-room hideaway working on his acclaimed natural history and social history novels. The hut has been left almost exactly as Williamson left it around four decades ago . Auction: The Henry Williamson Trust, which is administered by direct descendants of Williamson, has run and maintained the hut since the author's death. They have now decided to put the hut up for auction and the sale is set to take place on May 23 . Since his death in 1977 it has been left virtually untouched with books, clothes, reading glasses and a gramophone record all remaining just as the reclusive wordsmith left them. The remote hut is close to the pretty village of Georgeham near Woolacombe in North Devon and is made from oak and elm with slate roof tiles with a brick fireplace. The Henry Williamson Trust, which is administered by direct descendants of Williamson, has run and maintained the hut since the author’s death. Acclaimed: Henry William Williamson passed away in 1977. He won the Hawthornden Prize for literature in 1928 for his novel Tarka The Otter . However the trust has now decided to auction off the hut and land, as well as a substantial detached 1950’s studio nearby, on May 23. Colin Thorne, of Webbers Property Services, said: 'I have done this job for 30 years, and I have never ever had this sort of experience where you feel so connected to such a well-known person. 'It’s like he just popped out for a walk and would be back any minute. It’s a complete and utter privilege to be a part of it.' In 1999, a former cottage owned by Mr Williamson sold for £98,000 - despite being valued at around £60,000. However, Mr Thorne, who conducted the . previous sale, said it would be impossible to predict how much the . writing hut would sell for. He said: 'I have no idea what it’s going to go for. How do you put a value on a place like this? 'If someone wants to by a piece of history, they may pay a lot more than someone who wants their own piece of North Devon. 'It would be wonderful if the next stage of its life is in some way related to its former use. It’s too special to be let go. 'I just want to see it go to somebody who loves it for what it is.' Henry Williamson won the Hawthornden . Prize for literature in 1928 for Tarka the Otter, which describes the . life of an otter and details its lush habitat along the River Taw and . River Torridge in Devon. The name 'Tarka' was said by Williamson to mean 'wandering as water'. It . is often described as a children’s book but Tarka the Otter influenced . literary figures including Ted Hughes and Rachel Carson and has never . been out of print since its first publication. Historic: Colin Thorne, of Webbers Property Services, said: 'I have done this job for 30 years, and I have never ever had this sort of experience where you feel so connected to such a well-known person. It's like he just popped out for a walk and would be back any minute. It's a complete and utter privilege to be a part of it' A labour of love: The remote moorland cabin was built by Williamson in 1929 in a village in North Devon, with the profits from his most famous book, Tarka The Otter . Award-wining: The novel traces the life of Tarka an otter, living on the River Torridge . Tarka the Otter was written by Henry William Williamson and was first published in 1927. A year later the novel won the Hawthornden Prize for literature. The book, which remains Williamson's best-known and most popular work, has never been out of print since first publication. It tells the tale of an otter, Tarka, and his life on the River Torridge. Divided into two parts - The First Year and The Last Year - the novel follows Tarka learning to swim and hunt, deal with losing a sibling in a trap and surviving after he is separated from his mother. In his second year Tarka fathers a litter of cubs with his mate White-tip. Throughout the novel Tarka is pitched against his main enemy, another local otter Deadlock. The book ends with a climatic nine-hour hunt of Tarka by the pack, and a confrontation between Tarka and Deadlock. Williamson was born in London and moved to Georgeham in Devon in 1921. He began making notes for Tarka the Otter two years later, while the book took four years to complete. The author often claimed he was inspired to write the novel after rescuing and raising an otter cub, but the truth of the story remains shrouded in mystery. The original edition feature illustrations by Charles Tinnicliffe. While popular with children, the novel was not intended for a young audience. The novel was adapted into a film, which was released in 1979 - two years after Williamson passed away. One of his sons, Richard, and his daughter-in-law, star in the film.","Tiny wooden hut was built by Henry William Williamson in 1929 with the profits from his novel Tarka the Otter .

"Barack Obama was today accused of ignoring the deficit as he called for aggressive spending to boost growth and for higher taxes on the rich, proposing an election-year vision for the U.S. The President’s 2013 budget proposal to Congress requests more than $800billion for job creation and infrastructure investment, while urging a minimum 30 per cent ‘Buffett Tax’ on millionaires. In a big opportunity before the November election to convince voters that he deserves a second term, President Obama, 50, earmarked billions of dollars for roads, railways and schools. Important speech: President Barack Obama delivered remarks on his administration's 2013 $4trillion budget at Northern Virginia Community College in Annandale, Virginia, on Monday morning . ‘We built this budget around the idea . that our country has always done best when everyone gets a fair shot,’ President Obama said, while also proposing tax breaks should be extended . to spur hiring. He wants the budget to benefit those . ‘who have done fantastically well over the last few decades’ and also . ‘the middle class, those fighting to get into the middle class and the . economy as a whole’.

Miss Cristerna grew up and still lives in Guadalajara, Mexico, one of the most notorious ghetto neighbours in the country where violent gang culture is rife. She also endured many years of domestic abuse. But that has not stopped Miss Cristerna being the person she wants to be. Scary lady: The former lawyer turned video jockey has said she has always been different .

Her busy schedule also sees her travelling the world as a video jockey alongside her close pal and DJ partner on the decks Gis Sanchez. A close friend said: 'In the early days local people and anyone from the community would cross the street when she passed, making cross gestures as if she was the devil or was possessed. 'People feared her immensely and were understandably intimidated by her presence. 'Many thought she was on drugs or crazy! But now they kiss her hand when they meet her. 'Many almost worship her and take her blessings like she is some kind of goddess with mystical powers.' 'Vampire woman' Maria Hose Cristerna poses for the camera showing off her tattoos and subdermal implants which look like horns . A close friend said people used to cross the road if they saw Miss Cristerna coming but now she is a successful video jockey who travels the world with her DJ friend Gis Sanchez . Miss Cristerna is in Vienna, Austria, this weekend taking part in an event called Wildstyle - a tattoo convention. Miss Cristerna said: 'I am expressing beauty through my art for the world to see. 'God lives inside of me and I believe it is what I do daily for others and my actions that make me who I am, not how I look or my appearance.

'We all have the power to change the world if that is what we choose to do. 'Even if it is just changing your own world or circumstances. We have the power within us all'. Human evolution and 3D body modification artist Steve Haworth is largely credited with popularising sub-dermal implants. While Haworth only uses Silicone implants, Teflon (PTFE) and biocompatible materials are used for similar effect. Horn bumps can be inserted subdermally into the forehead. Iconic international performer The Lizardman takes part in Street Performance World Championship 2012 . Implants can be repeatedly removed, with larger ones added when the skin is ready, leaving a more dramatic effect. However, users face several health risks, including infection, tissue resorption, nerve and muscle pressure, migration, and implant rejection, among others. Immediately after the horns are implanted into the head, it will feel swollen and sore. About a week later the person may experience some black eyes and puffy eyelids. This is due to the body producing excess lymph fluid around the implants, which drains down the face before dispersing throughout the body via the lymphatic system. It is important that you change your pillowcase every two days to ensure that your head is not resting on a contaminated surface while you sleep. Until the wounds and stitches heal you may see a small amount of blood on the cloth in the morning. Although most transdermals appear healed in two to four weeks, the actual internal healing process takes much longer — approximately one year. They can cost between $500 and $2000 for an inplant depending on the design.","Maria Cristerna grew up in a deeply religious family in Mexico .

"Luis Enrique has brushed aside Gerard Pique and Lionel Messi's trip to a casino hours before Barcelona's crucial Champions League date with Manchester City and insists it is not an issue. Pique and Messi, along with  Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas, were pictured leaving Casino de Barcelona in the early hours of this morning, shortly before the squad was due to depart for Manchester. Coming so soon after Saturday's shock 1-0 defeat to Malaga, it has caused a furore. When Pique was asked by Spanish journalists if he had anything to say, the former Manchester United defender replied: ‘No. It is my private life. I just had a nice night.’ Gerard Pique described Manchester City as one of the top five teams in the world ahead of Tuesday's game .

Pique (centre) and Fabregas (left) were joined by Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi (second right) And Enrique brusquely dismissed a question that the World Cup winner had done anything wrong, stressing that Pique and the rest of his squad remain focused on taking a step towards the Champions League quarter-finals. Enrique said: ‘No gossip. Not interested. Only football. At this club, you sometimes need something extra to decorate the tree of life.’ Barcelona has won 11 consecutive games prior to the defeat to Malaga and it once again raised questions about how Barcelona’s players are gelling with Enrique but Pique denied there had been in-fighting. ‘No, there is no problem between us and the manager,’ he said. We get on fine, the relationship is good. We don’t have to worry about it. It is just one defeat, it is behind us now. We have shown how we can play here in the past. Suarez is all smiles as he stretches with Brazilian Adriano during Barcelona training in Manchester . Suarez shares a joke with his Barcelona teammates ahead of their Champions League clash with Man City . ‘When you lose a game you get doubts arising. We need a good result. We know this team can play to a great standard. The fans will be right behind City. We will have to take the game to them. I’m sure we will get a decent result here.’ It was put to Enrique whether Barcelona had relaxed against Malaga, in preparation for the trip to Manchester, but that was met with another stony face from the manager. ‘’We did not relax,’ said Enrique. ‘We were well prepared and we would never go into a league game thinking about a Champions League match. There was no difference in the tactics.’ These sides met at this stage last season but Enrique is expecting a difficult match. He respects City and is expecting Barcelona to be pushed to the limit to preserve their record of having reached at least the quarter-finals for the last eight years. Brazilian ace Neymar trains ahead of Tuesday's game against Manchester City in the Champions League . Andres Iniesta  on the ball during a training session ahead of the  first leg match against Manchester City . ‘Last year Barcelona were in control in terms of possession,’ said Enrique, who was not manager 12 months ago. ‘The penalty (that Martin Demichelis gave away) was quite important. We ended up with a big advantage for the second leg. We just want to give a good performance.’ Messi and Neymar will be the headline acts but Luis Suarez will also be eager to prove a point on his return to England and Enrique feels the former Liverpool striker is adjusting smoothly to life in Catalonia. ‘Luis is doing really well,’ said Enrique. ‘It is his first season here. He is a reference in this team. He allows other forward to work around him. He is going to be a big player in the future for Barcelona.’ Messi trains with his teammates ahead of Barcelona's clash with Manchester City on Tuesday night .

"Now that I've now reached the great age of 90 (wow!), I thought it would be a good time to look back on all the amazing travel adventures I have been lucky enough to experience… . OFF TO A FLYING START . The urge to travel started soon after the Second World War when rationing was a very unwelcome part of life in Britain. At 21 years old, I was desperate to see the world, and I managed to land a job as an air hostess with British South American Airways. Danger lay in every flight, but to me the glamour and fun far out­weighed the risks as I headed from Heathrow to Santiago in Chile, a journey that - amazingly by today's standards - took more than a week to complete. Giving something back: Eve with some of the girls in Morocco who have benefited from her foundation . Throwing away the ration book: At the age of 21, Eve became an air hostess and travelled to Santiago in Chile . Best foot forward: Eve, pictured right with her son Richard, tried to master the tango on a trip to Spain . The Avro Yorks and Lancas­trians were the only choices of aircraft for the route and they were ill-­equipped for passengers. However, all was soon forgotten when we landed first at Lisbon, followed by Dakar, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires and finally Santiago, where we could throw away our ration books and fill our tummies. Helping local communities: Eve's charitable foundation teaches young girls living in villages in Morocco's Atlas Mountains to make crafts and objets d'art, which it then sells on their behalf . My partner Ted thought the only way to stop me flying was by proposing to me. At the time he was training to become a bar­rister, so it was up to me to earn the bread - but what could I do? My only real training had been in ballet and dance, so when a friend offered me the chance to learn the art of tango in Granada in Spain, it was time to enjoy another fantastic adventure - a week of passion, elegance and sensuality. Deliciously wicked. With the Alhambra Palace perched high on a hill nearby, I set about trying to master the dance. I found the tango as complicated as its roots yet as simple as the desire for two human beings to move as one. There was also time for a light-­hearted salsa lesson, twirling and swirling to the pulsating beat. But afterwards I was glad to revert to the tango, to glide grace­fully across the floor until a well deserved sleep came my way. Adventurous streak: Richard Branson kisses his mother before embarking on his balloon flight in 1998 . PADDLING INTO PERIL . Later in life, things were becom­ing monotonous so when my son Richard suggested a canoe trip down the Zambezi river, Ted and I were thrilled. Little did we realise the danger it entailed. Setting off in a not very substantial fibre­glass canoe, we soon had to stop paddling - there were two cape buffaloes nearby, one on either bank of the river. The nearest one to us suddenly decided to make a charge. With its mouth wide open, horns shaking and tail flailing furiously, it thundered towards us. Our guide bashed the side of the boat with his paddle and shouted a few unprintable words before the bull took fright. I believe this type of dangerous safari is no longer allowed. As our guide later reminded us: 'Where there is something to eat, there is some­thing to eat it - don't put yourself on the menu!' The other big dangers on the Zambesi were hippos and croco­diles. Pole position: Sir Richard Branson takes his parents Eve and Ted on a rafting expedition in Jamaica . A trip down the Zambezi can be fraught with danger - including the possibility of being charged by buffaloes . A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN . What better way to spend an afternoon than watching hand­some young men dashing about on horseback playing polo? Some­times players will travel half ­way around the world just to take part in a match. The players are so keen that during a seven­-minute chukka, they may have to change ponies and even jump from one to another. This sport, sometimes described as rugby on horseback or the sport of kings, is played mainly in the South East of England, but I have become aware of a similar, but not quite so expensive, alter­native - bicycle polo. It looks just as exciting and almost as dangerous, so why not have it in every park for people to enjoy? Family ties: Sir Richard sweeps his mother off her feet at a charity event and, right, mother and son help to promote the Wimbledon tennis tournament near the London Eye with tennis star Laura Robson . Out of this world: Eve supports her son as he unveils a model of his Virgin Galactic spaceship in America . MAGNIFICENT MOROCCO . While I was waiting for Richard to embark on his circumnavi­gation of the world in a balloon, I had time to explore the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, where illiteracy rates in some Berber villages can be up to 98 per cent, while many survive without gas, electricity or running water. I decided it was time in my life to give back some of what I'd gained, and consequently I formed a charitable foundation with the aim of teaching the young girls of these villages to make crafts and objets d'art, which we could then sell on their behalf. These girls often leave school at 13 with no future prospects aside from perhaps looking after their father's cow. The Eve Branson Foundation has now been very successful and we teach upwards of 40 girls every day, in three villages. They are all anxious to learn. HAVING A BALL - AND PROVING RICHARD WRONG . The foundation naturally needs funds, so every year we hold a variety of fundraising events. One kind friend in Los Angeles used to stage a ball, but when that ended I had to come up with another idea. I suggested to Richard that we hold a polo weekend. 'Oh no,' he said. 'That won't make any money.' Well, it's always nice to prove your son wrong. That first year we made £30,000 and this year it was so successful that we made £110,000. So I am hoping the Eve Branson Foundation will be in a financial position to keep afloat for a few years to come. Our next polo weekend is in Morocco next April - I hope to see you there.","Eve started her adventures at the age of 21 when she became an air hostess .

"E! News host Giuliana Rancic has helped a two-time cancer survivor to chop off 45 inches of her hair while live on air during Wednesday’s episode of The Rachael Ray Show. Giuliana, who was herself diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011, was given the honor of making the first snip from 59-year-old Charley’s hair, before calling on a team of stylists to help her transform the previously lengthy locks into a chic bob. Charley’s decision to cut her hair, which previously extended all the way down to her thighs, was especially emotional, as she has spent the last nine years growing her hair back after losing it all while undergoing chemotherapy treatment in 2005. Scroll down for video . New look: Charley, a two-time cancer survivor, was given a dramatic haircut by fellow cancer survivor Giuliana Rancic on The Rachael Ray Show . Shear genius: Ms Rancic made the first cut, chopping off a whopping 45 inches of hair . Charley said that the loss was 'devastating' because she'd always taken pride in her lengthy locks. 'People know me by my long hair; it's a trademark,' she explained. 'I couldn't face the world without my hair. My crowning glory was gone; my self-esteem was gone; my confidence was gone. I lost more than just my hair when I lost my hair.' Charley's first bout with the disease came at age 23, when she was diagnosed with uterine cancer. The long and short of it: The 59-year-old hadn't had a haircut in nearly a decade . Although she didn't lose her hair during that treatment, it led to a life-changing meeting with a young girl in a children's cancer ward, who said her greatest wish was to have long hair like Charley's. 'They could've shaved my head in that moment and I would've handed her my hair,' she recalled of the heartbreaking moment. From then on, Charley donated her her hair to children with cancer every few years up until her second diagnosis nine years ago. Mirror, mirror: Charley was stunned when she saw her stylish new look for the first time . Youthful look: 'This is reminiscent of my thirties,' Charley told Ms Ray and Ms Rancic of the new hairdo . Charley told Ms Rancic, who underwent a double mastectomy after her diagnosis, that she was ready for her first haircut in nearly a decade. The 40-year-old TV personality chopped off Charley's ponytail, announcing that a team of professional stylists from New York City's Cutler Salon was waiting backstage to finish the job. When it was time for the big reveal, Charley stepped out in a sleek, modern bob, gasping as she saw her stunning reflection in an oversize mirror. 'This is reminiscent of my thirties, and I'd like to go back there,' she said.","Ms Rancic, a fellow breast cancer survivor,made the first snip before handing over the scissors to a team of stylists ."
"A graduate who held up a sign advertising his skills to commuters at Waterloo Station has landed his perfect position after his direct approach to job hunting paid off. Alfred Ajani, 22, feared he was getting nowhere after unsuccessfully applying for more than 300 jobs following his graduation in May. He got up early to intercept passing city workers at the busy London station last month, holding a sign saying: 'Marketing Graduate - Please ask for a CV'. His approach was well received by passing executives and one director who saw him has now signed him up. Scroll down for video . Determined job-hunter Alfred Ajani (centre) started work for recruitment firm, the Asoria Group, this week after one of the firm's directors walked past him as he handed out CVs in Waterloo Station last month . Alfred stood on the busy station concourse with a sign advertising his skills after failing to find a graduate position despite applying for 300 roles . Alfred, from south London, started in a marketing role at recruitment agency the Asoria Group yesterday and now works just yards from the spot where he once stood looking for a job. He said: 'The director walked past me when he saw me that morning, but later got in contact through [the website] Linked In. 'The company said they were looking for someone with out of the box ideas and so they were keen to get me in.' In recognition of the fame his stunt brought him, Alfred's new colleagues made special T-shirts with his photo on them to welcome him on his first day. He added: 'The job is one I wouldn't have got if I hadn't gone to the station that morning, so I advise anyone out there who is in the same position I was to think of more direct ways to speak to employers.' After his story was reported by MailOnline, his new colleagues printed T-shirts to welcome him on his first day . Thousands of commuters pass through Waterloo Station every day on their way to jobs in the City of London . Statistics show that almost half of recent graduates are now in 'non-graduate' or 'stepping stone' roles, such as bar-tending, and are struggling to get the positions they had hoped for. Alfred had always wanted to work in advertising, but after three years studying for his degree in the subject, was losing hope of ever joining the industry. In a last-ditch attempt to speak to potential employers, he went to Waterloo Station with an armful of CVs and was later inundated with offers. After months spent struggling to get an interview, he suddenly had a flood of offers and found himself able to choose his career path. He said: 'I knew this was somewhere I wanted to come and am really looking forward to the opportunity.'","Alfred Ajani applied for more than 300 jobs after graduating in marketing .

"A pregnant mother whose unborn child has been diagnosed with a tumour is to carry on with her pregnancy - despite being told the baby has just one per cent chance of survival. Lisa Tilbury, 22, was devastated after doctors broke the news at her 20-week scan that her baby had a 10p-sized tumour at the top of one kidney. She was told she could terminate the pregnancy, but decided to not to despite the poor prognosis - and is now six months pregnant. Lisa Tilbury, 22, has been told her unborn baby has just a one per cent chance of survival because it has a kidney tumour but she has decided to continue with the pregnancy . The only hope the family have of realistically saving the unborn child is expensive laser surgery, carried out in the womb by surgeons at a specialist hospital in the U.S. - at a cost of £300,000. Ms Tilbury, from Bathgate, East Lothian, who also has a three-year-old daughter, Amy, said: 'I broke down when they told us, but this baby deserves a chance to live. 'A consultant told me the baby was very ill and that it had a one per cent chance of survival. It was devastating. 'A lot of people are telling me to get rid of it, but it deserves a chance. I don’t think they would understand unless they go through it themselves.' The pregnancy was developing without problems until doctors at St John’s Hospital, Livingston, discovered the baby had fluid in its stomach at the crucial 20-week scan. Ms Tilbury was sent to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and then referred to the Southern General in Glasgow, where she was kept in for further tests. Ms Tilbury has been told the only chance of saving the baby is pre-natal surgery which costs £300,000 . Doctors feared her baby might have caught a virus and needed a blood transfusion, but the results came back negative. Ms Tilbury was then given an ultrasound scan, but when the sonographer stopped half-way through the scan she knew something was wrong. She said: 'They were scanning me and I couldn’t see the screen. The nurse got her colleague. 'She had a look and then she stopped scanning. I was asking, ""what’s wrong?"" It was clear in the scan. It was about the size of a 10p piece. 'They did say the baby is very ill and it might not survive in the womb or after I have given birth.' Ms Tilbury is now trying to raise the money required to go to the U.S. for surgery in a bid to save the baby. Image shows the scan prior to that which revealed the tumour . Although she is in her sixth month, it is still unclear what the baby’s gender is or whether the tumour is cancerous or just a mass of tissue. Doctors are worried that it could be neuroblastoma - an aggressive form of childhood cancer. Ms Tilbury and the baby’s father, Blake Carrington, 21, have separated, but they are supporting each other through the ordeal. Mr Carrington said: 'It’s not hit me as much as my mum and Lisa. I don’t think it’s sunk in yet, not for me, anyway.' The family has been desperately researching the condition and have contacted experts at Boston Children’s Hospital in America, who could perform laser treatment on the tumour. The hospital is home to the world’s largest research enterprise at a paediatric medical centre, and could perform pre-natal surgery. Ms Tilbury (pictured with the baby's father, Blake Carrington, 21) said: 'I broke down when they told us, but this baby deserves a chance to live' But the family has only three months left and they say they need to raise a staggering £300,000 to pay for the flights and the overseas treatment. Mr Carrington’s mother, Helen Carrington, who has supported Ms Tilbury throughout the pregnancy, said: 'Lisa is distressed. The hospital is being very helpful. 'We have been speaking to a representative there, which is the same as a consultant here. 'We are doing research and getting information. No-one seems to know what it is. It would be great to find someone else in the UK that will know what it’s like.' The family have also launched an appeal for the cause - which they have called Baby Carrington, Our Little Braveheart. The family have organised several fundraising events and are urging readers touched by their story to come forward and help. Ms Carrington added: 'We have not got that much time. But if anything happens before we manage to get to America, I’m going to put the money towards somebody else in a similar situation.'","Lisa Tilbury was told at her 20-week scan the baby has a kidney tumour .

"Tie the knot: Adele Vellacott and Dave Cobain became the first Take Me Out couple to get married on Saturday . Adele Vellacott and Dave Cobain have become the first Take Me Out couple to get married. The couple, who live in London, met on the hit dating show but ended up going on dates to the show's fictional date destination - the Isle of Fernando's - with other people. Two years later they have a one year old baby, and on Saturday tied the knot in an intimate ceremony at Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel in Monmouthshire, South Wales.

Adele confesses to MailOnline that pined after Dave for months, but he kept spurning her advances. 'It was between me and another girl at the end, we were both from Wales, and he ended up on the date with the other girl. We all got flown over to Fernando's but our dates didn't work out, and Dave and I ended up building up a great friendship. 'He's lovely. Something about him pulled me towards him. 'In . the months that followed we ended up meeting at parties and reunions... he made me chase him for quite a while, playing hard to get. I really . liked him, he's a cheeky chappy. 'I liked . him from the start but didn't realise they were these strong . relationship feelings. I thought I wasn't his cup of tea because he kept . blowing me out when I'd ask him out on a date.

"Hillary Clinton was not telling the truth when she said the Obama campaign asked her to attack Sarah Palin for being a woman, President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign manager, David Plouffe, said in an interview released last weekend. 'We never tried to do that,' Plouffe said on an episode of Bloomberg Television’s Political Capital with Al Hunt. 'We did want her to go out there and speak, but not about Sarah Palin’s gender.' Scroll down for video . He said she said: President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign manager, David Plouffe, says Hillary Clinton was NEVER asked to make a gender-based attack on Sarah Palin during the 2008 presidential election. Plouffe is pictured here at a Bloomberg conference last November . Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claims in her new book that Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign wanted her to make a sexist attack on Sarah Palin when she was announced as the Republican Vice Presidential candidate . Clinton claimed in an interview with NBC earlier this month that, 'The day [Palin] was nominated, the Obama campaign did contact me and asked me if I would attack her.' 'I . said, ""Attack her for what — for being a woman? Attack her for being on . a ticket that's trying to draw attention? There'll be plenty of time to . do what I think you should do in politics, which is draw distinctions,"" ' Clinton recalled. Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton greets 10-year-old Anicee Lamoreaux as her mother Lisa Ferrerio takes a picture at the Tattered Cover Book store prior to a book signing event in Denver today . Clinton also described the run-in over Palin in her recently released memoir Hard Choices. The 2008 presidential candidate writes in the book that, 'The Obama campaign suspected that her nomination was a blatant attempt to scuttle their hope of welcoming the women who had vigorously supported me. They immediately issued a dismissive statement and reached out to me in hopes I would follow suit.' 'But I wouldn't. I was not going to attack Palin just for being a woman appealing for support from other women. I didn't think it made political sense, and it didn't feel right. So I said no...'' Sarah Palin posted a picture of the passage on her twitter account when the book dropped with the caption, 'Look who fired the 1st shot in the real ""war on women"". Hint: it wasn't the GOP. See this excerpt from Hillary's book.' The timing of Plouffe's claim is curious given that NBC News' Cynthia McFadden said weeks ago that the former secretary of state told her . during their sit-down interview that she allowed the White House to . review her book before it went to print because it included accounts . from the time she served in the president's cabinet. Plouffe has not worked at the White House for more than a year, and therefore may not have received a copy of the book before it was published like current senior staff did. But other members of Obama's team read it beforehand and reportedly made no requests for revisions, according to McFadden. The timing of Plouffe's claim is curious given that NBC News' Cynthia McFadden said weeks ago that Clinton, center, told her during their sit-down interview that she allowed the White House to review her book before it went to print . The afternoon before Clinton's book officially hit the shelves, Sarah Palin, who had somehow gotten a copy early, sent a tweet ridiculing the Obama administration for claiming it's her political party who has a 'war or women' Clinton's decision to speak out about the incident nearly six years later may be fueled by guilt. In an interview with ABC . News' Diane Sawyer that around the time of the book's release, Clinton . confessed that she didn't do a very good job during the 2008 . presidential campaign of pointing out that 'there is a double standard' for women in the public eye. 'And I think part of what I did not do was to be more clear in saying, . ""Look, this is a problem in our country.

"Underground tanks that hold a mix of . toxic radioactive waste at America's most contaminated nuclear site . pose a possible risk of explosion. A nuclear safety board made the announcement in . advance of confirmation hearings for the next leader of the Energy Department. State and federal officials have long . known that hydrogen gas could build up inside the tanks at the Hanford . Nuclear Reservation, leading to an explosion that would release . radioactive material. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety . Board recommended additional monitoring and ventilation of the tanks . last fall, and federal officials were working to develop a plan to . implement the recommendation. Scroll down for video . Risk: Underground tanks that hold a stew of toxic, radioactive waste at America's most contaminated nuclear site pose a possible risk of explosion (file photo) The 'tank farm' to store nuclear waste on the Hanford nuclear reservation was built in 1944 . The board expressed those concerns . again Monday to U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, who is chairman of the Senate . Energy and Natural Resources Committee and had sought the board's . perspective about cleanup at Hanford. The federal government created Hanford in the 1940s as part of the secret Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb. It spends billions of dollars to . clean up the 586-square-mile (1518-square-kilometer) site neighboring . the Columbia River, the southern border between Washington and Oregon . and the Pacific Northwest's largest waterway. Federal officials have said six . underground tanks at the site are leaking into the soil, threatening the . groundwater, and technical problems have delayed construction of a . plant to treat the waste for long-term safe disposal. Those issues are likely to come up during confirmation hearings next week for Energy Secretary-nominee Ernest J. Moniz. The fears of explosion and . contamination could give Washington and Oregon officials more clout as . they push for cleanup of the World War II-era site. Central to the cleanup is the removal . of 56 million gallons (212 million liters) of highly radioactive, toxic . waste left from plutonium production from underground tanks. Many of the site's single-shell . tanks, which have just one wall, have leaked in the past, and state and . federal officials announced in February that six such tanks are leaking anew. Tanks on the site were put in place in the 1940s but are long past their 20-year life span . The nuclear safety board warned about . the risk of explosion to Wyden, who wanted comment on the safety and . operation of Hanford's tanks, technical issues that have been raised . about the design of a plant to treat the waste in those tanks, and . Hanford's overall safety culture. In addition to the leaks, the board . noted concerns about the potential for hydrogen gas buildup within a . tank, in particular those with a double wall, which contain deadly waste . that was previously pumped out of the leaking single-shell tanks. 'All the double-shell tanks contain . waste that continuously generates some flammable gas,' the board said. 'This gas will eventually reach flammable conditions if adequate . ventilation is not provided.' All of the tanks are actively . ventilated, which means they have blowers and fans to prevent a buildup . of hydrogen gas, and those systems are monitored to ensure they are . operating as intended, Energy Department spokeswoman Carrie Meyer said. 'DOE is absolutely committed to ensuring the safety of Hanford's underground tanks,' Meyer said. The U.S. government spends about $2 . billion annually on Hanford cleanup - roughly one-third of its entire . budget for nuclear cleanup nationally .

The new video shows vertigo-inducing pictures of the giant slide being built on site. The slide's drop is so steep, it is almost at a right-angle to the ground. Thrill-seekers will need to climb 264 steps to reach the top where they will wait on a deck made from railroad tanker cars. They will then be sent hurtling down into the pool below. The exact height of the Verruckt has not being revealed but bosses say it will be taller than the current record holder, the 134.5ft Insano slide in Fortaleza, Brazil. Under construction: The slide is being built and is due to open in May when it will be officially measured . Thrilling: Once at the bottom of the huge drop, riders are then sent up a second five-storey hill . Verruckt's height will be officially measured its May opening date. Larry Pitcher, the park's director of marketing and sales, told The Kansas City Star: 'We have always been family friendly, but this will attract those adrenaline junkies who are always looking for that next biggest, coolest thrill.' The rafts will drop more than 130ft before being sent up another five-storey tall hump and then down again into the pool.

"Parents angrily confronted a head teacher after he gave primary children books about tackling homophobic bullying. Police were called after the protest, which had been orchestrated by religious campaigners, became heated. Head teacher Jamie Barry is said to have faced aggression and verbal abuse at the meeting at Welford Primary in Birmingham, one of the schools linked to the ‘Trojan Horse’ scandal earlier this year. Head teacher Jamie Barry (pictured) is said to have faced aggression and verbal abuse at the meeting at Welford Primary in Birmingham, after children were given books on tackling homophobic bullying . It was one of 21 schools inspected by Ofsted amid claims of a conspiracy by hardliners to impose strict Islamic practices. While Welford, which has a large Muslim intake, was given a clean bill of health, inspectors reported some children saying they believed it was wrong to be gay. The protest occurred at a regular parents’ meeting last month. Mr Barry was expecting about 20 attendees to discuss routine matters, only to find around 100 parents there demanding to know about the introduction of teaching materials called Challenging Homophobia in Primary Schools (Chips). The parents had been encouraged to attend by anti-abortion group the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (Spuc), which shares common ground with conservative Muslims on several issues. Welford (pictured) was  inspected by Ofsted amid claims of a conspiracy by hardliners to impose strict Islamic practices - while given a clean bill of health, inspectors reported some children saying it was wrong to be gay . An email obtained by the Daily Mail was sent to some parents by Antonia Tully, who coordinates Spuc’s Safe At School campaign. She listed 13 questions she asked to be forwarded to as many parents as possible to support Spuc’s view that young children should not be taught about homosexuality. The email said the head teacher ‘needs to hear the same concerns’– such as ‘teaching children about sexual orientation isn’t making them safe [but] putting ideas into children’s heads’. As a result, the meeting – involving parents from a variety of religious backgrounds – became heated. Some complaints were ‘very personal and very aggressive’, Mr Barry said. Staff called the police and the head was advised to leave the room, although he denies police escorted him from the premises for his own safety. An email  was sent to some parents by the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children's Safe At School campaign - the anti-abortion group shares some common ground with Conservative Muslims . Mrs Tully said she got involved at Welford after being contacted by parents earlier this year. ‘They told me that someone phoned the police which was a very inflammatory reaction. 'They said nothing that happened at the meeting warranted any police involvement,’ she said. She has helped dozens of parents to complain to Birmingham Council about the school. Chips, which features a series of story books, is being used in about 35 Birmingham schools. Mr Barry said he had not been surprised to hear that some pupils had made anti-gay remarks. ‘We were aware that they might do, because culturally, within the community we serve, we know those views are heard,’ he said. ‘But it made us think that as a school we need to do a little more in terms of teaching children about diversity and relationships. ‘While we respect everyone’s right to a personal view, same-sex marriage is legal and some same-sex couples adopt or foster. 'Our children will come into contact with these people and we don’t want it to be a shock to the system.’ Rob Kelsall, senior regional officer for the National Association of Head Teachers, said the Government must give its ‘full support’ to heads who deliver the Chips programme.

"Birth rates among Polish women rise by two thirds when they move to Britain, official figures showed yesterday. Those who migrated here after 2004 have an average of 2.13 children compared with the 1.30 level seen in their native land. Romanians have enjoyed an even bigger baby boom – producing 2.93 children in Britain but only 1.25 back home. New figures from the Office for National Statistics shows women from Romania have the highest fertility rates in England and Wales . The . women may have been playing ‘catch-up’ after delaying pregnancy ahead . of emigrating, the Office for National Statistics said. But higher . income – whether in wages or benefits – and  better schools and living . conditions in Britain, may also have encouraged the extra births, the . agency added. Its report on . childbearing rates among British-born and foreign mothers suggests that . the immigrants likely to come from Romania and Bulgaria following the . lifting of labour market  restrictions in January will  push up the UK . population with their offspring. UK-born women in England and Wales have an average of 1.84 children in a lifetime . The . ONS report, based on 2011 and 2001 British census findings, and records . held by the EU statistics arm Eurostat, aimed to throw light on why . birth rates among migrants are much higher than for their counterparts . born in this country. The . overall fertility rate of women born in Britain was 1.84 in 2011 – up 18 . per cent since 2001. Among foreign-born women, it was 20 per cent . higher, at 2.21 births. The . 2011 census recorded a 3.7million population increase in England and . Wales over the decade, around two thirds of it brought about by . immigration and high birth rates among migrant mothers. ‘Fertility . rates in Poland and Lithuania were very low, as in much of Southern and . Eastern Europe,’ the ONS said. ‘But the fertility rate of women born in . these countries living in England and Wales was relatively high, above . that of UK-born women.’ The . report said this meant migration was altering the childbearing rate of . Eastern European women, or that women who migrate are different from . those who stay at home. Another explanation was that ‘conditions were . better in England and Wales  for childbearing than in Poland or . Lithuania’. The report . pointed to the catch-up effect, adding: ‘If the support – financial, . social, educational – for childbearing and family life is better or . worse in England than in the population’s country of origin, this may . have an effect on the number of children they choose to have.’ Poland, Pakistan and India top the league table of countries by number of births . Fertility . rates among migrants were highest among mothers from Africa and lowest . among those from Australia and New Zealand, the ONS said. There . were also low fertility rates among migrants from China, South Korea, . Singapore and Germany, where some British women who are now having . children were born as daughters of British service families. Women . from Singapore showed fertility rates of 1.1, whereas mothers from . other parts of Asia were much more prolific. The birth rate among women . from Pakistan was 3.82 and from Afghanistan 4.25. Libyans . and Algerians boasted among the highest figures – 5.58 and 4.32 . respectively. Women from Botswana and South Africa had fertility rates . below British-born women.","Total fertility rate - average number of children they can expect to have - for Romanian women in England and Wales is 2.93 .

"Still a hero: Gunned down Army vet Francisco Garcia was initially said to have returned from Afghanistan just before his murder but Army officials now say that's not true . The U.S. Army revealed Wednesday that a vet murdered outside what Los Angeles police said was his 'return from Afghanistan party' was never deployed in the Central Asian country . IN fact, they say he never fought abroad at all. Francisco Garcia's tragic November 9 murder was infuriating enough to military families and patriotic Americans alike, but became immeasurably more horrifying after witnesses and police on the scene in Sylmar reported the soldier had just returned from active duty in war-torn Afghanistan. Only, he hadn't. And LAPD authorities have yet to explain the conflicting stories. The U.S. Army said Wednesday that Garcia enlisted in June 2012 and discharged this past July. He was stationed at Ft. Drum in Watertown, New York, according to CBS News. However, accounts from the start from friends of Garcia seemed unclear whether he'd served abroad or not. Nonetheless, police did quickly identify a suspect in the case and made an arrest for 21-year-old Garcia's murder on Tuesday. A witness claims that 18-year-old Vincent Estrada was one of the occupants of two cars that pulled up to Garcia after he'd left a party at his girlfriend's house Sunday. Witness Brian Enriquez, 21, told the LA Times that, after leaping from one of the cars and smashing a beer bottle on the ground, Estrada grabbed a handgun and yelled: 'Are you ready for this?' He then opened fire, police say. Garcia was dead on scene. Estrada was arrested Tuesday in the Sylmar area and booked on suspicion of murder, Los Angeles police spokeswoman Officer Nuria Vanegas said. The Army says Garcia was stationed at Ft. Drum in Watertown, New York and never fought in Afghanistan or any other country following his June 2012 enlistment . Before Wednesday's revelation about Garcia's service, Los Angeles police Lt. Paul Vernon told reporters that 'the ironies are obvious. To survive as a soldier in an overseas conflict, only to be killed in your neighborhood upon your return.' Vernon said: 'Apparently a simmering dispute had boiled over during the night, and this suspect came looking for Francisco.' Authorities talked to several witnesses and collected evidence, including several bullet casings. Enriquez told the LA Times: 'He was a very loving, caring person. He would always have a smile on his face. An all-around amazing individual.' A witness claims that 18-year-old Vincent Estrada (not pictured) was one of the occupants of two cars that pulled up to Garcia (center) after he'd left a party at his girlfriend's house Sunday. Witness Brian Enriquez, 21, said that, after leaping from one of the cars and smashing a beer bottle on the ground, Estrada grabbed a handgun and yelled: 'Are you ready for this?' High hopes: Friends say Garcia had hoped to soon join the California Highway Patrol and had already been accepted into the academy . Hundreds mourned Garcia's death at the spot where he died in Sylmar, including his 25-year-old friend Fernando Mora. 'He came back alive,' Mora told the Los Angeles Times. 'So to die like this, it's not right.' However, some friends on scene disputed to NBCLA that Garcia had served abroad. And LAPD officials backpedaled on their original report within hours of a release that said the party was a 'homecoming.' 'There was a gathering, but it wasn't specifically for a homecoming,' Detective Juan Santa said. Garcia soon hoped to join the California High Patrol, and according to friends had already been accepted to the academy. Estrada was booked on suspicion of murder. Mourning: Hundreds mourned Garcia's death at the spot where he died in Sylmar, including his 25-year-old friend Brian Enriquez, who told police that Estrada shouted 'You ready for this' before gunning down Garcia .

"Theresa May has backed the possibility of a new grammar school in her constituency, despite laws which ban the creation of selective schools. In a move which could herald a change in the Tory party's education policy, the Home Secretary indicated she would support a study which will look into opening a 'satellite' grammar school in Maidenhead, Berkshire. The new state-funded selective school - which would be the first for a generation - would be a second 'satellite' campus joined to an existing grammar school in a nearby borough. Theresa May (left) has signalled her support for a new grammar school to open in her constituency, despite a similar move being ruled out last year by former education secretary Michael Gove (right) Because of that, it would avoid breaching laws which stop new selective schools being created. It comes after Michael Gove, the former education secretary, ruled out a similar proposal in Sevenoaks, Kent, which would have taken up to 1,300 pupils. Mr Gove - who was keen to revamp comprehensive schools - allowed a new free school to open on the site, instead. Ms May's willingness to consider the move sends a strong message about her stance on academic selection - a topic which is still hotly-debated among the Tory party. A statement on her website says the home secretary 'welcomed proposals to consider establishing a ""satellite"" grammar school site in Maidenhead', in response to parental demand. Testing: Some grammar schools admit successful students by their grades in the 11-plus, while in other areas, pupils who pass the test are also ranked by admission criteria, such as the distance they live from the school . She said: 'Grammar schools attract considerable support from Maidenhead families. If a good school wishes to expand in line with existing legislation then this must be seriously considered.' One of Ukip's policies is to allow existing schools to apply to become grammar schools. The proposal for the satellite campus has come from Windsor and Maidenhead council, which is looking to create more secondary school places in the area. There are currently no grammar schools in the borough, although there are several in neighbouring Buckinghamshire. The Tory-run council says there will be a shortfall of 100 secondary school places in Maidenhead - which currently has a comprehensive education system - by 2020. There are currently 164 grammar schools in England after many of them closed in the 1960s and 70s when there was a shift towards comprehensives. The establishment of any new wholly or partially selective state-funded schools is banned under the the former Labour government's School Standards and Framework Act 1998. However, existing schools are allowed to expand. At present, some grammar schools admit successful students by ranked order - all candidates are ranked by their 11-plus score. In other areas, pupils who pass the test are then ranked by admission criteria, which can include the distance they live from the school. Those opposed to grammar schools argue that by dividing children at the age of 11 through taking an exam is socially divisive, and other schools in the surrounding area suffer, and richer children are more likely to succeed because their parents can afford extra tuition to get them through the test. However, supporters say that academically bright children do better if they taught together.","Home Secretary supports study looking at new school in Maidenhead, Berks .

"Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, claims the Department of Education does not know if the money it has set aside for places is enough . Under-performing schools could be forced to expand to deal with a chronic shortage of places, MPs warn today. They say education is at risk because of a lack of planning by the Department for Education. Some schools may have to turn libraries or music rooms into classrooms or create classrooms  in playgrounds. The warning comes from the Public Accounts Committee, the latest group to raise concerns about the lack of school places. In March, a study by the National Audit Office (NAO) warned that by September 2014, an estimated extra 256,000 school places will be needed. The Department for Education (DfE) has said it is spending £5billion by 2015 on new school places, and that it expects 190,000 extra places will have been created by September. However the committee’s chairman, former Labour minister Margaret Hodge, claims that the DfE does not know whether this £5billion ‘will be enough to pay for them or even spent to best effect’. In its report, the PAC says the department and local authorities did not anticipate ‘how much and where pupil numbers were rising early enough and therefore failed to plan adequately for the increased demand’. The report warns that the need to increase the number of school places should not be done at the expense of quality. Mrs Hodge said: ‘It does not take much imagination to realise that educational opportunities and standards might be diminished if specialist areas, such as music rooms and libraries, are converted into classrooms, poorly performing schools expanded or playgrounds used to house children in overcrowded demountables.’ Some schools may have to turn libraries or music rooms into classrooms or create classrooms in playgrounds . Schools minister David Laws replied that the Coalition was ‘clearing up the mess left by Ed Balls and Labour when they were in government’. He said: ‘Margaret Hodge is right that there is a severe need to ensure there are enough school places but she has failed to pin the blame where it belongs – at the door of the last Government of which she was a member.’","Some schools may have to turn libraries or music rooms into classrooms .

"A Florida man who died after downing dozens of live roaches during a contest early last month in which the grand prize was a python, has been revealed to have choked to death according to an autopsy released Monday.

Lab tests for drugs came back negative. The death has been ruled an accident. Scroll down for video . Eddie Archbold, 32, died as a result of 'asphyxia due to choking and aspiration of gastric contents,' according to his autopsy report . Archbold died after downing the bugs as well as worms in October for the Midnight Madness bug-eating competition at Ben Siegel Reptile Store in Deerfield Beach, about 40 miles north of Miami. Archbold became ill minutes after the . contest and collapsed in front of the store. He was taken to the . hospital where he was pronounced dead. During the competition, Eddie was . eating so many live roaches he had to cover his mouth to keep them from . crawling out, swallowing some of them whole and still alive. He ate more than 60 grams of meal worms, 35 three-inch-long 'super worms' and a bucket of discoid roaches, according to the Miami Herald. Eddie - who was father to two daughters aged six and nine - wanted to win the competition so he could give the grand prize of an $850 ivory ball python to his friend as a present. But he started vomiting and collapsed in front of the store shortly after winning. Victory for short-lived for Edward Archbold who won a roach-eating contest but then choked to death shortly after . Edward Archbold died shortly after downing dozens of live bugs and worms in a roach-eating contest . Archbold, seen here in an undated mugshot, won a python from the competition . Prior to the autopsy  result Dr Bill Kern, a professor of entomology . at the University of Florida, had speculated it might have been an allergic . reaction to the large amount of foreign protein that killed the 32-year-old. He told the Herald: 'We know cockroaches shed a lot of . allergens, but they’re not toxic in and of themselves. 'Very . few [human] cultures tend to eat cockroaches because they store large . amounts of uric acid and nitrogenous waste. And they tend to be . scavengers and feed on things most people wouldn’t consider to be . desirable.' None of the other 30 competitors fell . ill after the contest and store manager Ben Siegel's attorney said the . roaches were all raised in sterile conditions and were perfectly safe to . eat. Despite this, all competitors were asked to sign waivers acknowledging the risks of gastrointestinal . illness, adverse . allergic reactions - especially in those with shellfish allergies - and . injury or pain associated with consuming live insects as they pass . through the esophagus. Matthew . Karwacki, a 26-year-old student at Florida Career College in Lauderdale . Lakes, was standing next to Eddie as they both ate the meal worms in . the first round. But he said when he tasted his first cockroach, he was . out. 'I just had one roach and tapped out . after that,' he said. 'The taste did not suit me, but the texture for sure was the . worst part. 'If you could look inside a dirty gutter and . scoop up what’s in there, that’s what went through my head. All the . other contestants kept eating roaches, but I had to look away.'

It is the latest twist in the ongoing controversy over the wearing of the religious garment, that sparked a riot in the French capital Paris on Friday. An order was sent out by the Filipino Government yesterday instructing females who teach Arabic language and Islamic values to take off the religious niqab, which covers all of the face except the eyes. The Government believes this will lead to better relationships between teachers and pupils. Education secretary Armin Luistro said it was part of reforms designed to make schools more sensitive to religion. The ruling does not apply to the hijab - garments that cover the head only. Muslim schoolgirls will still be allowed to wear the veil in schools as well as 'appropriate clothing' in gym class. But while female Muslim schoolteachers can wear the veil outside class, they have been told to remove the veil during lessons so they can interact better with students. The order stated: 'Once the teacher is in the classroom, she is requested to remove the veil.' It added the move would help aid 'proper identification of the teachers by their pupils, thus promoting better teacher-pupil relationship'. It would also help the teaching of languages, where 'lip formation' plays a role in pronouncing certain letters. The Government’s Office of Muslim Affairs said it agreed with the education department’s measures, although it had not yet received a copy of the order. Roque Morales, an adviser to the office, claimed that while he did not know how many Muslim Filipinas were working as teachers, the practice of wearing veils, such as hijabs and niqabs, was widespread in the southern Philippines. Breaking down barriers: Education Secretary Armin Luistro believes the ban on the veil will lead to better relationships between teachers and pupils . Exempt: Schoolgirls, like this one, will continue to be allowed to wear veils around schools, but their teachers will have to remove full face niqabs similar to this one on the left . He said: 'You would almost see it everywhere.' So far there have not been any complaints from Muslim teachers, he added. The office said that Muslims make up about 15 per cent of the Philippine population, mostly based in the southern regions, which they consider their ancestral home. The hijab and niqab - a religious garment worn by some Muslim women to cover their whole face - continue to divide cultures around the world. Two years ago, France banned the niqab and the burqa from being worn anywhere in public in a move that sparked protests among Muslims. Protests: Muslims took to the streets when France banned the niqab and burqa from being worn in public places . On Friday rioting broke out in the Paris suburb of Trappes after police carried out identity checks on a Muslim woman who was wearing a full face veil, according to the Guardian. Her husband was arrested and taken into custody amid allegations he had assaulted one of the officers involved. Hundreds of people took to the streets, hurling stones and paving slabs and setting fire to cars, bins and bus shelters, demanding his release. Riot police tackled them with tear gas. The police station was said to have been under siege for about an hour. A second night of rioting followed on Saturday, when violence threatened to spread to nearby towns. The Collective Against Islamophobia in France released a statement . complaining of heavy handed policing. In 2004 France introduced a law banning state employees from wearing prominent religious symbols, such as Christian crosses and Jewish skullcaps, as well as Muslim veils. Current France President Francois Hollande now wants a new law that could extend this into the private sector.

"There will be a new emphasis on spelling and grammar, and history lessons will focus on the story of Britain . After six weeks of summer  holidays, children can find it quite a shock to be back at school. But when term resumes this week, it may be even tougher than usual. For the country is about to undergo the biggest education shake-up in a decade with a new, tougher national curriculum. And further changes are planned, with Education Secretary Nicky Morgan saying the Conservatives will pledge at the next election to make every pupil study five core academic subjects until they are 16. Scroll down for video . Education Secretary Nicky Morgan saying the Conservatives will pledge at the next election to make every pupil study five core academic subjects until they are 16 . Under the new curriculum, children aged five will have to recite poetry by heart,  11-year-olds will sit maths exams without calculators and teenagers will study at least two Shakespeare plays. Computer programming will be taught from five to 14, and foreign languages will be made compulsory at primary school. There will be a new emphasis on spelling and grammar, and history will focus on the story of Britain. The more traditional curriculum is the culmination of a four-year campaign started by Michael Gove. His successor Mrs Morgan has pledged to continue the drive. But many parents have been left in the dark and teachers say they are not ready to teach the material. Two-thirds of parents are totally unaware of the changes, a survey of 1,000 by the tuition firm Explore Learning found. And six out of ten teachers say their schools are not prepared, a poll by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers showed. The curriculum was finalised last September – which eight out of ten teachers said left too little time to make changes. In the survey of 618 teachers, nine out of ten labelled the Department for Education’s approach ‘chaotic’ or ‘flawed’. Nansi Ellis, of the ATL, said: ‘The Government has rushed through the biggest change to the national curriculum in a decade. ‘Children . . . face an uncertain time as their teachers are still trying to make sense of the new curriculum. It is extremely unfair to jeopardise young people’s education through what seems to be national mismanagement of change.’ Carey Ann Dodah, of Explore Learning, said: ‘The curriculum is a response to fears that England is slipping behind international competitors and there are some drastic changes.’ Meanwhile, Mrs Morgan said the Tories will press for more reforms if they win the election. She laid out plans yesterday for all pupils to study GCSE English, maths, science, one language and either history or geography. Schools that do not teach the five subjects – which together make up an ‘English baccalaureate’ – will not be eligible for a ‘good’ rating from Ofsted, she said. ‘We want students to be able to keep their options open for as long as possible,’ Mrs Morgan added. She said that while students in wealthy areas already learn these subjects, ‘that is not always happening in less advantaged areas’. A Department for Education spokesman said teachers had time to prepare for the changes, adding: ‘We will not stand by and allow pupils to lose ground with peers in countries across the world.’","Every pupil will study five core academic subjects until they are 16 .

"Couples who stay married into their 70s can look forward to an even better time together, research suggests. One reason, it found, is that men learn to appreciate their wives more. Mutual dependence within marriage becomes particularly important to men after 70, partly as compensation for the loss of male friends to death. Another reason is that men are more in touch with their feminine side as they get older and women become more masculinised, making for a more level physical and emotional playing field, the study found. Happy together: Married couples enter new bliss in their 70s, an American study has found . Happy couples also make the most of the empty nest after children have left home, and earlier stressful relationships with them become easier. Top US psychiatrist George E.Vaillant, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who has just turned 80, took over the Harvard Grant Study in 1966. It has followed the lives of 268 men from age 19 to 92 years in the longest study of human development, starting in 1938. Prof Vaillant said the Grant study shows that ‘loving people for a long time is good’. He said ‘The most important finding proves that the only thing that really matters in life are your relations to other people. Support: Mutual dependence becomes particularly important to men after 70, partly as compensation for the loss of male friends to death . ‘Mutual interdependence comes later to some people than others, but most of the Grant men got there, which proves that the best marriages got better with time.’ Of the original 268 men, 242 survived early death with 173 marrying only once. In total, 51 of the 173 from once-only marriages remained happy for half a century, with 73 rated ‘so-so’ and 49 men remaining a lifetime in a poor first marriage. The study findings were based on regular interviews, with men sent a questionnaire eight times, and their wives four times and couples being interviewed together at the age of 30 and again at 80. During the period from age 20 to 70, only 18 per cent of both partners reported their marriages as happy for at least 20 years. By age 75 half of the surviving men did and by 85, the proportion of happy marriages rose to 76 per cent as reported by both partners - who also said they felt healthier than those in less happy marriages. Prof Vaillant said ‘Friendship and mutual dependence in marriage deepen late after 70. ‘Indeed, the study documented that, barring brain damage after age 70, marriages get better!’ He said men’s tolerance for mutual dependence increased with age and after 70, the men found their marriages more precious. More compatible: Men are more in touch with their feminine side as they get older and women become more masculinised . ‘As one 85-year-old hitherto very independent man acknowledged ""You let your wife learn about you…"" it was compensation for the loss by death of his many male friends’ he added. Prof Vaillant, who is giving a lecture in London tonight hosted by the relationship charity OnePlusOne said there were four reasons why marriages improve after 70. Firstly, the so-called empty nest becomes more of a blessing than a burden. Second, the age-related hormonal changes in hormone levels that take place in men and women tend to ‘feminise’ husbands and ‘masculinise’ wives, making for a more level physical and emotional playing field, he said. Third, the physical infirmities of aging make it plainer to both parties that mutual dependence is an advantage rather than a weakness. Finally there is a well documented U-curve to wellbeing over the lifespan, he said, with a low point in middle age when couples may have to deal with ageing parents and needy, possibly ungrateful, adolescent children. ‘At 80 that angst has passed’ he said. Increasing empathy between couples means ‘the best marriages get better with time’ he added. Penny Mansfield, director of OnePlusOne, said ‘I’ve studied relationships for over 30 years and never seen so much interest especially amongst young people in wanting to discover the secret of how to find the right partner and make a relationship last. ‘This study offers insight into why relationships matter and what makes them last. ‘Being able to scrutinise these men’s relationships over more than seven decades gives us a fascinating insight into enduring love. ‘For some, their long marriages were the outcome of a deepening intimacy, for others it was down to a life- long commitment to staying together.’","Men appreciate their wives when they hit their 70s, study finds .

"A brain surgeon's carefully planned holiday marriage proposal turned into a calamity when he lost the engagement ring he’d buried in a beach for his girlfriend to find. Dr Steve Carr had hoped to propose to Mary Naam by allowing her to discover the diamond encrusted band while the pair dug in the sand. But the plan went awry when - on the shores of Pelican Bay at Naples, Florida – no ring appeared after they had dug around the pinpointed spot for a few minutes. Blunder: Brain surgeon Steve Carr, with fiancee Mary Naam, who tried to propose by burying her engagement ring on a Florida beach, only to forget where he put it when the time came .

Dr Carr, who had travelled with Miss Naam from their home in Denver, Colorado, said: ‘I’d asked her parents’ permission a couple of days before and I wanted it to happen on this trip. ‘It wasn’t very smart. I wouldn’t recommend doing something so risky.’ However, Dr Carr was determined to pop the question properly and recruited a dozen beachgoers and resort workers to help find the sparkling band. But after two hours had passed, Miss Naam stepped in to help the bungling brain surgeon and phoned metal detecting expert Larry Spearing, who dug it up in within minutes. ‘We were digging and digging and I thought there was no way we were gonna find it,’ Miss Naam explained.

"The bicycle of missing student Michaela 'Mickey' Shunick was discovered under a bridge today more than a week after she disappeared. Fishermen found the 22-year-old's bike at Whiskey Bay on the Atchafalaya River, Louisiana. Her family were brought to the scene by police and confirmed it was her black and gold Schwinn. The bike's condition was not released and authorities began searching the river by boat. Divers planned to go in when the current became less strong. Scroll down for video . Missing: Shunick was riding a black Schwinn bicycle with gold handle bar grips (pictured) and wearing a brown leather backpack purse when she disappeared . Two days prior to her bike being found, police revealed they had uncovered surveillance footage of the student riding her bike. Two videos show the University of Louisiana student on St John Street and St Landry Street in Lafayette. In both videos a white four-door pick-up truck is seen to pass by after Miss Schunick and date from 1.47am and 1.48am when the student had left a friend's house on May 19. 'Investigators are seeking information regarding a white newer model four door pickup truck, which was captured on video after Mickey Shunick traveled on both streets,' said a statement from the Lafayette Police Department. Police have said it has taken this long to release the new information because much of the surveillance footage had to be watched in real time and then enhanced to positively identify Miss Schunick.

Police have said it has taken this long to release the new information because much of the surveillance footage had to be watched in real time and then enhanced to positively identify Miss Schunick. Investigators had found no cell phone or purse of the missing woman after she left her friend Brettly Wilson's house. And as investigators expanded their search to include a $25,000 reward for information, some people in the area began to wonder whether she had even been abducted. Mystery: Michaela 'Mickey' Shunick, a 22-year-old anthropology major at the University of Louisiana, was last seen leaving a friend's house . While hundreds of University of Louisiana students and some of Shunick's friends have been helping the police with their searches, the night she went missing still plays on minds. 'It's something you keeping asking ourselves, if there's something that we overlooked or something that we missed,' said Brettley Wilson. Painting a clearer timeline of the evening, police are keen for witnesses to come forward from the Artmosphere bar that Shunick attended from 10 pm till midnight and then onwards to Wilson's house and to a Taco Bell drive-thru at around 1.24 am. Desperate search: Michaela Shunick has been missing since Saturday after being last seen cycling home at 2am in Lafayette, Louisiana . Receiving a phone call from a friend at around 1.31 am, Wilson drove Shunick to his home to collect her bike and she rode off at 1.45 am leaving Wilson. 'She checked her bike, took out her mace, made sure it was on. I walked her out, watched her get to the drive way then I closed the door and locked it,' said Wilson according to KATC . That was the last time that anyone saw her. 'Now we're able to show the family that, hey, we know she traveled to Versaille, we know she it as far as St.Landry Street, and that there was a white pick up truck in that area,' said Corporal Paul Mouton, Public Information Officer for Lafayette Police. Support: The community in Lafayette attend a vigil to pray for the missing student . 'Someone was in that immediate area when she passed on the bike so it's trying to identify with those people and getting that information back so we can hopefully get closer to finding her.' Indeed, after seeing the white pick-up truck released by the police, new leads are already coming forward. A local girl, Tasha Patterson claims that it is the same truck that approached her two months ago while she was riding her bike down South College around 2 pm. She says that after heading back from a meeting a man in a white truck pulled over and asked if she needed a ride. Patterson says she was exhausted and was not thinking clearly and got in. Shine a light: Friends and fellow students gathered in a park in downtown Lafayette last night to support Mickey's family in the search for her . Fun-loving: Mickey Shunick (pictured right) missed her brother's graduation on Saturday . Throughout the car ride the man apparently offered her money in return for sex, an offer which she refused. Dropping her off unharmed, Patterson described the truck as a white GMC Sierra 2500 Texas Edition and during the journey told her matter-of-factly that: 'He rides around town all the time trying to pick up pretty girls'. The driver was described as white, heavyset and in his 50's or 60's.","Family identified her black and gold Schwinn bike after it was found by fishermen .

A Tesla coil is an electrical resonant circuit that produces high-voltage, low-current, high frequency electricity. It features two main sets of windings - a primary, input, and a secondary output. Each is made up of a capacitor and an inductor, so they become resonant circuits when voltage is passed through the coils. The primary winding pushes the voltage through to the second winding, via a spark gap, and this creates the bolt of energy.

"Metalist Kharkiv midfielder Edmar Halowski de Lacerda says he regrets changing his nationality to Ukrainian after he was called up to fight in the country's army. The Brazilian-born footballer changed his citizenship to the Eastern European country so he could represent them on the international stage. However, a consequence of this now means he must enrol in compulsory military service - something the 34-year-old admitted he never considered upon changing passport. VIDEO Scroll down to watch some Edmar highlights playing for Ukraine's Metalist Kharkiv . Ready for war? Edmar Halowski de Lacerda has been called up for compulsory Ukraine military service . International pedigree: Halowski de Lacerda has won 11 caps for Ukraine, scoring once . Conscript: Brazilian footballer Halowski de Lacerda (right), pictured here marrying Tetiana Halovsky (e, has been called up to fight for Ukraine after he became a citizen of the eastern European country . Ukraine had compulsory military service for school-leavers but Edmar was too old when he got his citizenship to have to worry about performing it, and in any case the country announced in 2012 that it was scrapping compulsory military service in 2013. But that changed when the country disintegrated and Ukraine's new leadership announced they were reinstating the military draft to address the deteriorating security situation and threats from Russia along the country's border. Acting President Oleksandr Turchynov issued the decree saying Ukraine will conduct a draft for active military service in the Ukrainian Armed Forces in order to increase the state defence potential. The decree says: ‘Ukrainian male citizens who are physically qualified for military service, over 18-years-old and older and who have no right for exemption from military service will be conscripted.’ It added that the measures were to address the deteriorating situation in the east and south of Ukraine, activities of illegally formed armed pro-Russian groups, the seizure and blockade of the state administration buildings, military administration facilities, military bases and so on which pose a threat to Ukraine's territorial integrity. Game on: Halowski de Lacerda currently plays in midfield for Ukraine outfit Metalist Kharkiv . But that has left the footballer, who married Ukrainian Tetiana Halovsky in 2008, with orders to report for duty and he admits: ‘I hadn't reckoned on this and although I'm a bit nervous that it might not get sorted out, I have to say that my wife is terrified. I have told her not to worry though and everything will be fine. ‘To be honest, I don‘t know what I would do if I actually went into the army. Playing football is the only thing I can do. I haven‘t heard that any of my team mates have been called up, but maybe nobody says it out loud.’ For the last three years the midfielder has played for Metalist and he said the order to turn up for duty had been a complete surprise. Conflict: The Kiev government is embroiled in a military struggle with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Pictured is a rebel guarding the MH17 crash site . He added: ‘I had certainly not anticipated that when I got a Ukrainian passport. The club told me they will try to resolve the issue for me.’ The Brazilian came to the Ukraine in 2000 when he signed a contract with Tavriya Simferopol. He played at the club for five years before moving to Metalist Kharkiv, where he remains today, and after getting a Ukrainian passport he also played for the national side where he was capped 11 times, scoring a single goal. The games he played in included one against Poland in Kiev in 2013 in which the Ukrainians won 1-0. Edmar, unlike many fellow South Americans, remained in the Ukraine despite the political crisis. Those that left include six players from FC Shaktar Donetsk, and Edmar's team mate at Metalist, the Argentinian player Sebastian Blanco.","Edmar Halowski de Lacerda says he regrets his decision in changing his nationality .

Adriaunna's mother, Wendi Jackson, traveled to Golden City from her home in Overland Park, Kansas, and said she feels ‘lost.’ ‘You always want your baby to be in your arms, to know she's safe and at home and not lost and cold,’ Jackson tearfully said. The station KSPR reported that Adriaunna, her 8-year-old sister, Lydia, and two friends went to Hazel’s Park next to their home Monday afternoon after the first day of school. According to the missing girl's sister, Bobby Bourne drove up to the girls three times while they were playing in the park. Wendi Jackson, Adriaunna's mother, said that the 34-year-old man asked to girls for help with finding his own daughters. Family plea: Adriaunna's father, James Horton (left), her grandmother, Velma Horton (center), and the girl's mother, Wendi Jackson (far right), have appealed for the 12-year-old's safe return . Mother's agony: Wendi Jackson said she was feeling 'lost' after receiving the tragic news of her daughter's abduction . 'Adriaunna told the other girls to stay away and she went to see what was up,' Miss Jackson told The Kansas City Star. When Adriaunna's sister, turned around, the 12-year-old was gone. At around 5pm Monday, the girls' father, James Horton, called 911 to report his daughter missing. About two hours later, at around 6.30pm, Bobby Bourne was found in his truck by police on the other side of town. The man was alone in the vehicle. Velma Horton, Adriaunna's grandmother, told the press that Bourne and her son had done home repairs together, and at one time the 34-year-old was their neighbor. The grandmother added that she did not believe her granddaughter would have willingly gotten into Bourne's car. Heartbreaking: Adriaunna's 8-year-old sister, Lydia, poses with the girl's photo as she begs for the 12-year-old's return . ‘She wouldn’t get into a car with anyone,’ Velma Horton told Joplin Globe. ‘She would say she had to go ask her father, or me or her grandfather, first.’ Records show that Bourne has been on probation after getting a suspended sentence for assault and domestic assault in 2012. On Monday night, more than a dozen law enforcing agencies and search and rescue groups sent out hundreds of people to look for the missing girl. Volunteers scoured the area surrounding Hazel’s Park on horseback, in all-terrain vehicles, and using helicopters and dogs, while officers spent Tuesday canvassing the entirety of Golden city - a town of fewer than 800 people. ‘We are going to stay at this as long as it takes,’ said Barton County Sheriff Mitchell Shaw. Massive search: Hundreds of law enforcement agents and volunteers fanned out on horseback and ATVs to look for the missing girl . Meanwhile, Adriaunna’s 8-year-old sister, Lydia Horton, has made an emotional plea for her sibling’s safe return. ‘Please help find my sister,’ Lydia said, holding a photo of the missing seventh-grader, according to OzarksFirst.com.","Adriaunna Horton, 12, missing since Monday evening after being snatched from Hazel's Park in Golden City, Missouri .

"A Conservative MP insisted today that he had been misunderstood after sparking a major backlash by dismissing the Olympic opening ceremony as 'leftie multicultural c***'. Aidan Burley, who was forced to quit as a ministerial aide after attending a Nazi-themed stag do last year, delivered the barbs on Twitter during the event last night. But despite the politician's gripes with Danny Boyle's extravaganza, it proved a huge hit with the public, with 26.9million UK viewers tuning in to watch - the biggest British TV audience for 14 years. Scroll down for video . Spectacular ceremony: Performers enact the work of the NHS and Great Ormond Street Hospital in front of the rising spectre of Lord Voldemort from the Harry Potter novels . 'Foolish': Tory MP Aidan Burley, pictured with David Cameron in December, was last month sacked from his post as a ministerial aide . Backing down: Mr Burley's posts on Twitter, shown in reverse chronological order . One of Mr Burley's posts read: 'The most . leftie opening ceremony I have ever seen - more than Beijing, the . capital of a communist state! Welfare tribute next?' Shortly afterwards he added: 'Thank God the athletes have arrived! Now we can move on from leftie multicultural c***. Bring back red arrows, Shakespeare and the Stones!' Last night's event featured a flamboyant tribute to the NHS, in which staff and patients from the world-famous Great Ormond Street Hospital (Gosh) were given a special cheer as the hospital's name was spelt out by the beds. The Royal Navy, Army and Air Force raised the Union Flag, as the National Anthem rang out from Kaos, a singing choir for deaf and hard of hearing children. Mr Burley's tweets caused an avalanche of criticism on the social networking site, including from fellow Conservative Gavin Barwell. 'With respect, us Londoners are rather proud of the diversity of our city #nothingleftwingaboutit,' the Croydon MP tweeted to Mr Burley. Downing Street moved quickly to distance Prime Minister David Cameron from the comments, with a senior source saying simply: 'We do not agree with him.' The MP for Cannock Chase, Staffordshire, could also be facing a fight to keep hold of his seat after former footballer Stan Collymore, who hails from the area, angrily replied: 'I'll happily stand against you at the next election. You have no clue about our town or its people.' Mr Burley was touted as a rising Tory star when he won Cannock Chase in 2010 with a huge swing from Labour. Challenge: Former footballer Stan Collymore, who hails from Mr Burley's constituency, attacks the MP's comments . Rival: Labour's Lord Prescott weighs in . However, he lost his job as a . parliamentary private secretary when details emerged of a stag do he . attended in the skiing resort of Val Thorens last December. One guest was alleged to have dressed in an SS uniform while others were said to have chanted Nazi slogans. Mr Burley has repeatedly apologised for being present at the event, which is being investigated by French police, but denied behaving badly himself or breaking the law. In the early hours of this morning, the MP sought to placate anger over his Olympics remarks, posting the message: 'Seems my tweet has been misunderstood. I was talking about the way it was handled in the show, not multiculturalism itself.' London Mayor Boris Johnson added his voice to a barrage of criticism levelled at Mr Burley, dismissing the comments as 'nonsense'. Visiting the Olympic Park on the first day of the Games, the capital's Conservative leader said: 'It was actually the truth about this country in the last two or three hundred years told in a big, dynamic way. 'People say it was all leftie stuff. That is nonsense. I'm a Conservative and I had hot tears of patriotic pride from the beginning. I was blubbing like Andy Murray.' Tribute: Children representing the Great Ormond Street Hospital, the NHS and children's literature take part in the ceremony . Political statement? Boyle's NHS scene prompted Mr Burley to claim the tone was more left-wing than the 2008 ceremony in communist China . Inclusive: A choir of deaf and hard-of-hearing children perform in the opening ceremony . Costly: Tony Gallagher, editor of the Daily Telegraph, suggests Mr Burley's job could be under threat . He added: 'The thing I loved was the . heavy political stuff. I loved the emergence of the urban proletariat . and the rise of the chimneys and the forging of the ring.' Labour MP David Winnick said: 'I . would have thought that the general reaction in Government and amongst . senior ministers is that a period of silence on Mr Burley's part would . be much appreciated. 'The . fact of the matter is that his comments were totally inane, . anti-British and at variance with the feeling of millions of people up . and down the country over the success of last night's opening. 'A great number of people in Cannock, including many who voted for him, will be wishing they had a different MP.' Aidan Burley might have bemoaned the ceremony's supposedly socialist tone, but for the VIPs and dignitaries in attendance, the food on offer at a Buckingham Palace reception was positively bourgeois. Guests included David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Michelle Obama. But it was France's PM Jean-Marc Ayrault who must have felt most at home, as almost everything on the menu came with an elaborate French name. Among the cold dishes were Oeufs de Caille et Sel de Celeri and Cornet de Canard Fume Melon de Charentais. Hot dishes included Gateau d’Aigrefin Fume et Poireaux and Langoustines a l’Outhier, while for dessert the guests were served Financier au Chocolat et Cerises - a real mouthful. Labour . frontbencher Michael Dugher said: 'David Cameron should show some . leadership and demand a full apology from Aidan Burley immediately. 'Burley has got form. His comments were stupid, ignorant and offensive. 'David . Cameron has said that the Conservative  Party has changed but it is . clear from the words of his own MP that not a lot has changed.' The opening ceremony, in which the Queen had a starring role, featured a diverse cast including James Bond star Daniel Craig and writer JK Rowling - merging music, dance and special effects into a spectacular opening. The worldwide audience was treated to a greatest hits medley of British pop over the decades with bursts of the Beatles, the Jam, Sex Pistols and Dizzee Rascal. There were also excerpts from the Kinks, Frankie Goes To Hollywood and Mud's Tiger Feet before Emeli Sande sang the cup final classic Abide With Me. The average audience for the show - which ran from 9pm until 12.50am - was 22.4million. It is the highest rating since 1998's England-Argentina World Cup clash screened by ITV, which drew 23.78million. The most watched British broadcast in the past 20 years was Princess Diana's funeral in September 1997, with 32.1million viewers split across BBC1 and ITV. Danny Boyle's masterpiece was the biggest BBC1 show since an edition of Only Fools And Horses in 1996. BBC1 controller Danny Cohen said: 'BBC1 is all about bringing the nation together for its biggest moments, and I'm thrilled by the huge audiences who tuned in to watch last night's historic events. 'Danny Boyle's opening ceremony was an absolute triumph. I am very proud of the two BBC Drama films that formed part of the ceremony - the audience response to the film featuring Her Majesty the Queen and James Bond was one of my highlights.' Peak viewing figures of 23.2 million were recorded for England's Euro 2012 quarter-final against Italy last month, while 17.1 million watched the Wimbledon final between Andy Murray and Roger Federer.

"A week after restrictions on Romanian and Bulgarian migrants arriving in the UK were lifted, a new survey has revealed that more than three-quarters of British people want to see a cut in immigration. A British Social Attitudes survey found that 56 per cent of the population believe the number of migrants allowed into Britain should be cut by 'a lot', and a further 21 per cent feel it should be reduced 'a little'. However, NatCen Social Research has found that fewer people now than in 2011 think immigration is bad for the economy - 47 per cent in 2013 compared with 52 per cent two years previously. Findings: A survey has revealed three-quarters of British people want a cut in immigration, just a week after restrictions on Romanian and Bulgarian migrants were lifted. Pictured are Romanians passing through airport security for a flight to Heathrow . Journey: People put their luggage in a bus departing from Sofia's central bus station in Bulgaria to London via Austria, Germany and France . The latest results of the survey, which are to be revealed in a BBC Two documentary The Truth About Immigration tonight at 9.30pm, come nearly a week after access restrictions to the UK labour market were lifted for Romanians and Bulgarians. Penny Young, chief executive at NatCen Social Research, said: 'British Social Attitudes shows that public desire for a cut in immigration to the UK had begun to rise even before the restrictions on migrants from Romania or Bulgaria were lifted at the start of the year. 'Moreover, a majority of people who think immigration is good, economically or culturally, for the UK still want to see it cut. 'These findings highlight the complexity of this issue for politicians facing two elections in 18 months and with limited options if they want to attempt to reduce migration from Europe. 'The public broadly agrees that immigration is too high, but there are stark social divisions over the economic and cultural benefits of immigration.' Welcome: Home Affairs Select Committee Chairman Keith Vaz (left) greets arrivals at Luton Airport, including Victor Spiresau (right) The research shows 54 per cent of . respondents see immigration as good for the economy and 55per cent of . those who see it is as culturally beneficial also want to see . immigration reduced.

Regrets: Jack Straw (left) said predictions over the number of eastern Europeans entering the country in 2004 were 'catastrophic', although former home secretary David Blunkett (right) said he did not regret the decision . A . total of 85 per cent of those with few or no qualifications want to see a . decrease in immigration, while 88 per cent of people in higher grade manual jobs want a . reduction. In the documentary, presented by . political editor Nick Robinson, former Labour ministers reflect on their . decision to open the doors to workers from Eastern Europe in 2004, when . Poland and seven other countries joined the EU. Jack . Straw, foreign secretary from 2001 to 2006, said: 'The predications . were completely catastrophic. I mean they were wrong by a factor of ten. On immigration, it was bluntly a nightmare and it got more and more . difficult."" 'We did get it . wrong and I deeply regret it,' said Mr Straw. 'I regret it because it . undermines trust in government, if you're that wrong.' Assumption: Theresa May, shown visiting Border Agency staff with David Cameron in 2010 said there had been an assumption that immigration was good for the economy . However, David Blunkett, home secretary from 2001 to 2004, told the programme he did not regret the decision. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'I think there should have been more debate about immigration, I think we should have had a more calm, measured debate and sensible response to people's concerns. 'But also listening to what those concerns were, listening to people who were worried about jobs or wages or worried about the pace of change. 'And to have that debate about it rather than simply thinking you can't talk about it for fear that that might be the politics of the Right.' UKIP leader Nigel Farage told the programme that he believed that fear of being labelled as a racist has stifled the debate on immigration. Contrast: Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper (left) said there should be more debate about immigration, although Nigel Farage (right) told the programme he felt fear of being labelled racist had stifled discussion .

"Fans and critics alike of Justin Bieber took to Twitter to either mock or defend their idol when he was arrested in Miami, Florida, for driving under the influence and drag-racing on Thursday morning. While Bieber's fans, known as 'Beliebers', took to social media to stand up for the pop star, others were quick to capitalise on the 19-year-old's downfall, usually armed with the aid of Photoshop. Multiple users in particular pointed out Bieber's striking similarity to another teen idol who collects a lot of negative publicity - Miley Cyrus. Twitter user @Marissa_Pearson summed up a common sentiment online, saying: 'Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber were actually separated at birth uno'. For others, the joke has already worn thin however. @RonnnBurg wrote: 'If I see that half Justin Bieber, half Miley Cyrus picture or anything about Justin going to jail I'm going to go insane then unfollow.' Some Twitter users were keen to play up the fact that Bieber was reportedly stopped by police while doing 60mph in a 30mph zone, playing on the fact he was involved in a high-speed police chase. Others went further, playing on the news that the teenager was stopped while allegedly taking part in a drag race with his friend, aspiring rap star Khalil Sharief. When Bieber's police mugshot first surfaced on Thursday, the star appeared relatively happy and fresh-faced, despite joining the ranks of many celebrities who have worn an orange jumpsuit over the years. For some, the opportunity to superimpose Bieber into shots for the popular Netflix show 'Orange is the new Black' proved too much. Likewise, he was lampooned by others for sporting the orange gear, perhaps inspiring a new fashion craze for 2014. Bieber is of course not the first celebrity to appear in a police mugshot. He joins such illustrious ranks as Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton and Macaulay Culkin. Some suggested he could maybe turn to them for words of wisdom - that is, if they want to speak to him. Mug shot wall of fame: Bieber joins celebrities such as Lindsay Lohan (left) and Paris Hilton (right) in a long line-up of celebrities who have been arrested.

Bieber, an ardent fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs, made an appearance on the arena jumbotron. Other tweets were not so light-hearted. Perhaps the most surprising tweet of all came from actor Seth Rogen, who posted: 'All jokes aside, Justin Bieber is a piece of s***.' The comment has been retweeted more than 127,000 times at the time of writing.

"More than 20,000 people descended on Stonehenge to greet the sunrise on the longest day of the year. Cloudy skies prevented the gathering of pagans, druids and partygoers, from basking in the sun as they marked the summer solstice. By sunset last night, 2,000 people had arrived at the stone circle to begin an overnight vigil. Their numbers swelled before the sun reappeared just before 5am. The celebrations came ahead of a 'historic moment' in the ancient Wiltshire site's £27million transformation, where a nearby road will be closed and grassed over to restore one of the key approaches to the stones. Police made 22 arrests during the night, mainly for drug offences, which is fewer than in previous years. They praised the 'positive, friendly atmosphere' of the celebrations. Scroll down for video .

Superintendent Matt Pullen from Wiltshire Police said: 'The majority of people respected the conditions of entry and the amnesty bins provided were used. 'Approximately 70 cannabis street warnings were issued. As with previous years, the passive drugs dogs proved very effective. 'The success of the event depends largely on the good nature of those attending and we are pleased that people could enjoy solstice in the spirit of the event.' The summer and winter solstices are one of the few chances to walk among the stones and dance within the stone circle, which is usually cordoned off to visitors to protect the site from further erosion. Those gathered performed chants and music during the celebrations, with some also taking part in handfasting ceremonies where they promise to love each other for a year and a day, or for how long love will last. The solstice, which means the sun is standing still, was also marked by about 500 people at Avebury, Wiltshire, and a small crowd armed with golf umbrellas at Castlerigg in the Lake District, who kept watch for the sunrise at stone circles there.

"A police officer in Arizona has been the subject of controversy after his daughter’s elementary school told him to not wear his uniform when one the school property. The ban came after parents complained that the Coolidge police officer, Scott Urkov, had brought his child to Entz Elementary School in Mesa wearing his uniform and carrying a gun. According to school officials, the principal asked Urkov not to bring his gun to school anymore as parents were ‘concerned’. Controversy: Police officer Scott Urkov, with his two daughters, whose faces cannot be shown due to their age. Urkov was told not to wear his uniform and gun to the school . Outrage: Urkov posted on his Facebook wall that he couldn't believe he was asked not to wear his uniform at the school . ‘Some parents were concerned about the fact that there was a fully armed officer on campus and they spoke to the principal about it,’ Helen Hollands, a spokesperson for Mesa Unified School District, told KSAZ. Urkov was in shock, according to his Facebook wall. ‘Nothing like your kids school calling and asking if I could not come to pick up my daughter in uniform cause parents were concerned when their kids came home telling them there was a man at school with a gun. Are you freaking kidding me?’ Urkov wrote on Facebook the day after the incident. Some parents were surprised by the request. ‘If my kids saw that, I think they'd feel more protected to see a man in uniform at their school,’ parent Blaine Spencer said. 'Concerned': Helen Hollands, a spokesperson for Mesa Unified School District, said parents at the school had complained about Urkov's uniform and gun . 'No uniforms allowed': Entz Elementary School in Mesa, Arizona, where Urkov was asked not to wear his police outfit .

Urkov has since been invited to return to the school and turn the incident into a ‘teachable moment’ and speak at a special assembly about what police officers do in the community. But some people have expressed outrage over the school’s decision and have posted their opinions on their Facebook page. ‘As a police officer I would have certainly been offended if I was asked to not wear my uniform and gun while dropping off my child at school,’ David Tedrow posted. ‘If parents cannot distinguish a police uniform, then they need to be educated, not the officer.’ According to another person, Tim Johnson, the decision showed ‘ignorance and lack of sound reasoning skills by the school principal and district administrators’.","Scott Urkov of Coolidge Police Department went to pick up daughter from Entz Elementary School in Mesa .

"We've all faced the dilemma when preparing for a flight. How much hand luggage can we get away with taking on board. If your airline is Ryanair, it seems, you’d better be extra careful. A female passenger who fell foul of . their regulations was marched off a jet by police officers moments . before take-off, it has been claimed. Video posted online showing a Spanish . Guardia Civil officer ejecting the woman from the aircraft at Valencia . airport has caused outrage. Scroll down for video . Excess baggage: Video footage posted on Facebook shows the woman with her hand luggage moments before take-off on a Ryanair flight from Valencia . Pleas: The woman was filmed arguing with a Spanish police officer, who had been called on board by cabin crew to eject her . Off you go: After a minute or more of argument, the woman is forced off the flight. She claimed her credit card wasn't working and so she couldn't pay a £40 excess baggage fee . Spanish newspapers said she was judged . to have broken the airline’s rule of boarding with only a small package . because as she was carrying a scroll, which would not fit in her case, . and a book. Footage shows the Spanish woman begging to be let on board. Passengers are heard asking how they can help and if they can place the item in their suitcases for her. They can be heard shouting ‘shameful, . shameful’ at the officer as the woman is led off the plane. The video . was posted on Facebook by a user called Soraya Pla, who said the woman . shouted out as she entered the cabin that she had tried to pay an . oversized luggage fee with her credit card, but it had not been working. She added: ‘Look at what we have just . witnessed on a Ryanair flight, I am crying with impotence. They took her . forcefully, because of a simple book and a scroll that did not fit in . her bag.’ The clip has spread across the internet and led to calls from Spanish Twitter users to boycott the airline. Strict regulations: Ryanair prevents its passengers from carrying more than a small package on board as hand luggage . Ryanair rules state only one item of . hand luggage, with maximum dimensions of 55cm by 40cm by 20cm and . weighing up to 10kg, is allowed per person. Oversized baggage will be . refused at the boarding gate or subject to a £50 fee and placed in the . hold. The airline defended its actions, . claiming the woman had become disruptive and ‘pushed past its gate . agents without showing any ID or her boarding card’. A spokesman said: ‘This passenger was . in breach of airport security regulations, and having become disruptive . was properly removed from the aircraft at the request of Ryanair . agents.’ Ryanair chief executive Michael . O’Leary was at the centre of a storm in September when he described . passengers who forgot to print their boarding passes as ‘stupid’. Passenger Suzy McLeod was charged £236 to print out five boarding passes before a flight from Alicante to Bristol. She claimed she had already checked in . online but hadn’t printed out the boarding cards at home. But Mr . O’Leary  responded: ‘We think Mrs McLeod should pay 60 euros for being . so stupid.’ He is famously outspoken, once saying . about customer service: ‘People say the customer is always right, but . you know what – they’re not. Sometimes they are wrong and they need to . be told so.’ Ryanair has courted controversy in the . past with plans to sell standing only tickets for flights, charge . passengers to use the lavatory and install bunks in aircraft hulls.","Spanish woman was ejected moments before take-off having carried a book and a scroll on board because they wouldn't fit in her suitcase .

"Healthy diet: But four year-old Logan Knowles has been labelled 'obese' He loves riding his bike, plays football every day and always eats his vegetables. So four-year-old Logan Knowles’s mother was stunned when she received a letter from the NHS saying he was ‘clinically obese’. The letter warned that the little boy was so ‘overweight’ he was at risk of heart disease, cancer and diabetes. At 2st 12lb, Logan is three pounds outside the recommended weight range for his age, which is between 2st 1lb and 2st 9lb. Logan’s mother Stefanie Mrozowski, 29, said she was ‘furious’ he had been labelled obese, explaining: ‘It’s ridiculous – there’s nothing of him. ‘He is the smallest in his class and if anything he’s quite skinny for his age. He still wears clothing labelled for a three-year-old even though he is nearly five. ‘He runs around constantly, loves riding his bike and playing football, and always eats a healthy diet. There’s not an ounce of extra fat anywhere on his body.’ Hundreds of children have been sent letters informing them they are overweight or obese since the controversial child-measurement programme started. Eating disorder charities have described the letters as a ‘scare tactic’ that could have damaging effects on youngsters vulnerable to eating disorders. Miss Mrozowski, of Darlaston, Walsall, said she and her partner Luke, 33, a fire technician, had not been informed that Logan was going to be weighed at school earlier this month. Two weeks later they received a letter in the post stating that he was ‘very overweight’ for his age, adding: ‘Doctors call this clinically obese.’ It went on to list a string of risks associated with obesity, including cancer and heart disease. The stay-at-home mother, who also has two daughters Taiyla, 11, and Sydanie, ten, said labelling children obese while they were still growing was ‘dangerous’ and could lead to them developing eating disorders. ‘Kids these days have enough pressure to be the right size from magazines and TV,’ Miss Mrozowski said. ‘They don’t need it at school as well. ‘After she was weighed, my eldest daughter came home saying, “Mum, I’m the thinnest in my class”. I was furious. She is 11 years old. ‘I don’t want my kids coming home talking about how much they weigh, or thinking it’s some kind of competition. This is just a complete waste of NHS money and should be stopped.’ Miss Mrozowski wrote to her local NHS trust to complain. But the Walsall child-measurement team said that, although weighing children was a ‘sensitive issue’, it was important to identify children who were at risk of ‘growing into overweight or obese adults’. Sharon Jones, of the National Child . Measurement Programme, said: ‘I fully understand what a sensitive issue . this is for children and their families. Warning: The NHS letter sent to Logan's mother earlier this month . Shock: Logan's mother Stephanie Mrozowski said her son runs around constantly and loves riding his bike and playing football . ‘Over a third of children in years four and six are either overweight or obese nationally, and this is also true for Walsall. ‘Children are not growing out of their “puppy fat” like they used to a few decades ago and it is more likely that they will grow into overweight or obese adults if they are shown to be that at this age.’ She added that after speaking to Miss Mrozowski she ‘agreed that these measurements did not necessarily indicate a problem or a concern on this occasion’.","NHS say football-mad Logan is at risk of heart disease, cancer and diabetes ."

"Diane Mullineux and baby Nancie who was born after Diane discovered she had cervical cancer . Proudly holding her newborn daughter Nancie, Diane Mullineux understands more than most people how precious life can be. Because just days after finding out she was pregnant, the hairdresser was given the devastating news that she had developed cervical cancer. Her only hope was to abort the baby if she wanted to survive, doctors said. But desperate to keep the child, Miss Mullineux, 30, gambled on a second opinion – and was offered a pioneering operation to remove the tumour while the baby was in the womb. ‘One minute we were so happy at the thought of the baby, then suddenly I was faced with a life-threatening condition,’ Miss Mullineux said. Fortunately the surgery was a success, and after an anxious few months she gave birth to her daughter Nancie four weeks ago. Immediately afterwards, she underwent a full hysterectomy and medics say she is now clear of the disease. Last night she said she was still having to pinch herself to realise that both she and her daughter had made it.

However consultant surgeon Jonathan Herod, of Liverpool Women’s Hospital, gave the couple hope by suggesting world-first surgery could save both mother and baby. The procedure to remove the tumour and most of her cervix went ahead when Miss Mullineux was 11 weeks pregnant. Nancie was then delivered by caesarean at 33 weeks. She weighed in at 4lb 9oz. ‘I just feel so lucky that she’s here and I’m recovering,’ Miss Mullineux said.

"Emmanuel Adebayor might not be attracting much attention on the pitch but the out-of-favour Tottenham striker was sure to be turning heads when he turned up for training. The Togo forward arrived in style when he drove a £360,000 Rolls-Royce to the club's Enfield base as the team began preparations for the second leg of their Europa League tie with Fiorentina on Thursday night. Adebayor posted a picture to his official Instagram page of him standing next to the Phantom Drophead Coupe model on Monday before setting off for training.

"Nicolas Sarkozy has admitted that he wants to have another crack at the French presidency in 2017 to avoid ‘the fate of Tony Blair’, who he says has become sidelined as an expensive consultant. The former centre-right leader came to power in 2007, but lost the presidency in 2012, with some polls pegging him as one of the most unpopular presidents in the country’s history. Nevertheless, Sarkozy seems determined to attempt the road to high office once again. Creme of the crop? Nicolas Sarkozy recenlty posted a picture of himself on Instagram relaxing in a Paris cafe . His comments about Blair were leaked to the press and were made after talking to the former British prime minister about how he keeps himself occupied, according to The Times. Blair joined JPMorgan Chase in 2008 as an advisor and Zurich Financial Services use him as a consultant on environmental issues. He also fills his diary with talks. Precisely how much he earns a year isn't a matter of public record, but he's said to be one of the highest-earning public speakers in the world. Sarkozy wants to tread a different path and his plans for presidency were also revealed by close friend and former French first lady Bernadette Chirac, who admitted that Sarkozy was going to re-run for president during a recent radio interview. ‘He’s going to tell me off for saying so,’ she said. Sarkozy recently posted a picture of himself on Instagram, relaxing in a Paris café, his tumultuous presidency clearly a distant memory. Tony Blair is merely an expensive consultant, Sarkozy has apparently said . When he came to power in 2007, he styled himself as a Margaret Thatcher-style reformer, ready to revive France’s ailing economy with lower taxes, longer working hours, and an onslaught against the country’s powerful trade unions. But the country experienced continual high unemployment and the cost of living rocketed. Mr Sarkozy and his third wife, ex-supermodel Carla Bruni, were frequently criticised for their high living ways and particularly for spending a fortune on air travel. In 2011 it emerged they spent more than £65,000 equipping their new plane with state-of-the-art airborne ovens - just so they could enjoy fresh bread as they flew in the £50million Airbus A330. A further £2million was spent on bringing Mr Sarkozy's onboard office up to scratch. The aircraft, bought from Air Caraibes, cost £250million extra to refit, including an ensuite double bedroom and Nespresso machine. Other world leaders, including Prime Minister David Cameron, have been known to use budget airlines, but the Sarkozys insisted on five-star travel and accommodation wherever they went. The former First Lady - who still uses her maiden name from her pop star career - even made sure that the very best music centre, including a DVD player, was fitted on the plane.","Nicolas Sarkozy came to power in 2007 and lost the presidency in 2012 .

Quite simply, do they have the balls to take risks? 'We know that the current Chelsea team is capable of seizing the moment. The question marks are more about Tottenham this Sunday. Under Argentine boss Pochettino a number of young players have been given a prominent role in the side and Scholes has urged them to take the opportunity to claim a winners' medal in the fledgling careers.

'The Capital One Cup final is a great opportunity for the likes of Harry Kane, Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb to get a medal early in their careers.
