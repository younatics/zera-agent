If you've noticed an unusually high number of teenage girls sporting pink hair or dressed up to the nines in Hello Kitty, Japan's kitsch 'Kawaii' trend could be to blame. Translated as 'cuteness' or 'adorable', the look involves emphasising child-like features such as big eyes and wearing doll-like dresses in sugary pinks, blues and yellows. So popular is Kawaii in Japan that even men are getting involved, attempting to adopt androgynous doll-like looks, and in the UK, meanwhile, Kawaii is taking the teen world by storm. Scroll down for video . Cute! Kawaii girls strut their stuff on the catwalk during last year's Hyper Japan Kawaii Fashion Show . Adorable: Kawaii girl Pixie Late loves the seriously frilly 'classic Lolita' look . At Hyper Japan, an annual celebration of all things Japanese due held at London's Earl's Court at the end of July, you'll find more than a few British Kawaii girls. That's because the show also hosts a Kawaii fashion show, this year dubbed the 'Tokyo Fashion Story', where models will take to the catwalk in sugary style. Among those to take part in last year's show is Grace St. John, now a Hyper Japan model, and fan of the 'Sweet Lolita' style of Kawaii dressing, which includes piling on the lace, bows and frills in order to appear as sweet and girly as possible. 'I really enjoyed it,' she says of her appearance at the 2012 Kawaii show. 'It was really nice to be able to smile in a catwalk and wear the clothes that I really felt comfortable in and enjoy wearing.' But she admits that the outlandish Kawaii look can sometimes lead to problems when she's out and about in London. 'Sometimes being a Kawaii girl can be hard as a lot of people don't understand the fashion, and will shout at you in the street,' she reveals. 'But I do get a lot of people coming up to me and telling me how much they like my style too. I went from loving Kawaii things to being a bit of a kawaii-aholic!' Getting it right: Backstage at Hyper Japan's Kawaii Fashion Show, finishing touches are added . Looking good: Kawaii girls show off their ultra-girly rainbow style ahead of this year's Hyper Japan . 'I've always loved cute and frilly things . so it was inevitable I would end up in love with Japanese fashion,' adds fellow Kawaii girl, Katie Carter. 'Where I live in Essex, there's not much like it so I'm always getting . asked where I buy my clothes from and for what reason I'm ""dressed up"".' And Kawaii really is about dressing up. The commonest Kawaii style is called the 'classic Lolita', which despite referencing the Nabokov novel in the name, has nothing to do with looking sexy and everything to do with achieving a look that is as cute, girlish and pretty as possible. Based on frilled and furbelowed Victorian styles combined with a hint of goth, girls hope to achieve a porcelain-doll look using lashings of lace, ribbons, bows, ruffles, bloomers, aprons, and ruffled petticoats. Then there's the 'Sweet Lolita' look loved by St. John. Featuring even more ribbons, bows, and lace, than the 'Classic Lolita', it leaves out the gothic elements in favour of pastels. Fairy Kei is also popular and involves giant bow headdresses or bonnets, teamed with lighter, less extreme make-up. 'My initial inspiration was from Japanese . Lolita brands and the more classic style of Lolita fashion,' says long time Kawaii girl and Hyper Japan organiser, Pixie Late. Glamorous: A pretty, wearable take on the Kawaii look created by make-up artist, Karla Powell . Rainbow hair: A Kawaii girl shows off her striking two tone hairdo . Magical: Japanese singing sensation Kyari Pamyu Pamyu shows off her Kawaii inspired look . Finishing touch: From bags to shoes and now nails, Hello Kitty is on just about everything in Japan . 'I find it exciting and fun because being a . Kawaii girl means you can express your personal style creatively and . make it your own. 'Fashion has always been something I'm passionate about . and when you love what you do you tend to do want to do it well. It is . also great to share to everyone what Kawaii style is all about.' For that, Late has set up her own Facebook group, Frills and Frolics, to try and show a wider audience what Kawaii is all about. 'It's a great way to meet like minded people,' she explains. 'I founded Frills & Frolics group so that Japanese street fashion enthusiasts from all walks of life in the UK can meet and learn and share . their love for fashion.' 'I love Kawaii fashion as it makes me so . happy,' adds St. John. 'I just wish more people were able to enjoy it in the UK. It gives . me a chance to experiment and it makes getting dressed fun again.'","Kawaii looks include the 'Classic Lolita' and 'Sweet Lolita'

Children from every state secondary school will travel to the First World War battlefields as part of a £50million package of events to mark the centenary of the Great War. David Cameron yesterday pledged a ‘truly national commemoration’  in 2014 to remember the start of the ‘war to end all wars’. The Prime Minister said Britain had a duty to ‘honour those who served, remember those who died and ensure the lessons learnt live with us forever’. David Cameron said a speech at the Imperial War Museum today that the First World War's place in the national consciousness meant it had to be commemorated properly . Mr Cameron, pictured with a few of the schoolchildren in front of a Sopwith - a single seat biplane fighter introduced into the war in 1917 -  will send student ambassadors to visit the battlefields . He added that it would be a . ‘monumental mistake’ to forget the sacrifice and lessons of the . conflict, which left almost a million British soldiers dead. In a £5.3million project, two ‘student . ambassadors’ and a teacher from  every state secondary school will be . offered the chance to visit the great  battlefields, such as the Somme, . Verdun and Fromelles, and take part in remembrance ceremonies on the . Western Front. The trips will start in spring 2014 and run until March . 2019.

At the Imperial War Museum in London . yesterday, Mr Cameron said it  was vital to mark the war because of the . ‘sheer scale of the sacrifice’. ‘This was the extraordinary sacrifice . of a generation,’ he added. ‘It was a sacrifice they made for us, and it . is right we remember them.’ The war had also helped ‘make us who . we are today’, he said, pointing  to subsequent advances in the . emancipation of women, recognition for ethnic minorities and . improvements in medicine. The Prime Minister, who revealed his . favourite book is Robert Graves’s war memoir Goodbye to All That, added: . ‘There is something about the First World  War that makes it a . fundamental part of our national consciousness. ‘Put simply, this matters – not just . in our heads, but in our hearts. It has an emotional connection. I feel . it very deeply.’ Defence Minister Andrew Murrison, a former naval . doctor, acknowledged that while the conflict remained a controversial . event, it was right to remember those who had died. ‘The commemorations will be very much . focused on remembrance, making no judgment on right or wrong or . indulging in jingoistic sentiment,’ he added. ‘The fact is it happened, millions of people died and the consequences are still with us today.’ Chris Simpkins, of the Royal British . Legion, said: ‘The tragic events of 1914-1918 have left a deep imprint . on the fabric of the nation. More than a million Britons died in the First World War. The Battle of the Somme was one of the most deadly in the four year conflict. Here a party of Royal Irish Rifles is pictured in a communication trench on the first day of the Battle of the Somme . Personal accounts of life on the frontline are likely to feature heavily in the commemorations, most notably from the Battle of the Somme, the bloodiest day in the history of the British army . ‘The losses were felt in nearly every . town and village across the UK, as demonstrated by the monuments found . in every village green or churchyard. ‘It is right and proper the centenary has a strong local flavour.’ Mr Cameron added to his growing . historical blunders yesterday when he declared that 200,000 British . soldiers were killed during a single day of the Battle of the Somme – . ten times the true figure. On the battle’s opening day, July 1, . 1916, the British Army suffered the worst losses in its history, with . 40,000 wounded and 20,000 killed.

They will include: . £5.3million to allow children and teachers from every secondary school to visit battlefields such as the Somme, Verdun and Fromelles. National commemorations on August 4, 2014, to recall the first day of the conflict; on July 1, 2016,to remember the first day of the Somme; and in 2018 to mark the centenary of Armistice Day. £15million in grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund to support events across the country.

"By . James Nye . PUBLISHED: . 10:23 EST, 20 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:12 EST, 21 December 2012 . Three U.S. senators including John McCain have attacked the makers of 'Zero Dark Thirty', claiming its central claim that torture produced the breakthrough that led the CIA to Osama bin Laden is 'grossly inaccurate and misleading.' Dianne Feinstein, Carl Levin and McCain - all members of the Senate Intelligence committee - sent a letter yesterday to the head of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Michael Lynton, to register their complaint. They urged Lynton to 'consider correcting the impression that the CIA's use of coercive interrogation techniques led to the operation against Osama bin Laden' and insisted that the waterboarding of al-Qaida's No. 3 leader, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, did not provide information that led to the bin Laden's compound in Pakistan. Scroll down for video . Sen. John McCain has criticised the new Osama bin Laden hunt movie 'Zero dark Thirty' for its 'misleading' portrayal of torture . However, the makers of the eagerly anticipated movie, director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal, said disputed that interpretation and encouraged people to see their movie, already considered a top Oscar contender, before characterizing it. 'We depicted a variety of controversial practices and intelligence methods that were used in the name of finding bin Laden,' said Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal in a statement. 'The film shows that no single method was necessarily responsible for solving the manhunt, nor can any single scene taken in isolation fairly capture the totality of efforts the film dramatizes.' In addition, the filmmakers credited the 'hard work and dedication' of the intelligence community in finding and ultimately killing the mastermind of the 9/11 atrocity in which almost 3,000 people lost their lives. U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Senator Dianne Feinstein (left) also added her name to the letter sent to the creators of the movie along with Senator Carl Levin . But the senators said that after viewing the film they were left with the overall impression that torture of detainees led directly to the information on the courier who led U.S. operatives to the bin Laden compound in Pakistan. 'We are fans of many of your movies, and we understand the special role that movies play in our lives, but the fundamental problem is that people who see 'Zero Dark Thirty' will believe that the events it portrays are facts,' the three senators wrote. 'The film therefore has the potential to shape American public opinion in a disturbing and misleading manner.' 'Regardless of what message the filmmakers intended to convey, the movie clearly implies that the CIA's coercive interrogation techniques were effective in eliciting important information related to a courier for Usama Bin Laden. We have reviewed CIA records and know that this is incorrect,' they wrote. 'Zero Dark Thirty is factually inaccurate, and we believe that you have an obligation to state that the role of torture in the hunt for Osama bin Laden is not based on the facts, but rather part of the film's fictional narrative.' Bin Laden hunt: A very different side of the agent was seen days after Bin Laden's body was brought back. She even started crying . Last year, McCain asked then-CIA Director Leon Panetta for the facts, and he said the hunt for bin Laden did not begin with fresh information from Mohammed. In fact, the name of bin Laden's courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, came from a detainee held in another country. Feinstein, who heads the Intelligence committee, backed up McCain's assessment that waterboarding of Mohammed did not produce the tip that led to bin Laden. In their letter to Sony, the lawmakers said the ""use of torture in the fight against terrorism did severe damage to America's values and standing that cannot be justified or expunged. It remains a stain on our national conscience. We cannot afford to go back to these dark times, and with the release of 'Zero Dark Thirty,' the filmmakers and your production studio are perpetuating the myth that torture is effective. You have a social and moral obligation to get the facts right."" Director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal said in a statement from Sony that they depicted ""a variety of controversial practices and intelligence methods that were used in the name of finding bin Laden."" Bigelow and Boal, who won Oscars for 'The Hurt Locker,' said the new film showed that no single method was responsible in the successful manhunt for bin Laden, and no single scene in isolation captures the total effort the movie dramatizes. McCain said he watched the movie Monday night after receiving a copy. 'Zero Dark Thirty' is opening in New York and Los Angeles this week. It opens across the country next month. The eagerly antiicpated movie was produced in collaboration with CIA insiders and Oscar winning director Kathryn Bigelow enjoyed almost unprecedented access to security information about the hunt for bin Laden who was killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan on May 2nd 2011. CIA insiders have confirmed claims by the film’s director Kathryn Bigelow that she is entirely justified in focusing on the role played by a junior female CIA analyst, named Maya in the film and played by Jessica Chastain. On target: The agent was one of the first to advance the theory that the key to finding Bin Laden lay in Al Qaeda's courier network which led to his compound (pictured is the attack scene in the movie) Integral: The real-life agent who spearheaded the raid is reportedly furious that other agents- who she feels slowed down the progress of the search- were given awards for their work . Although the woman is still undercover and has never been identified, Zero Dark Thirty’s emphasis on Maya’s importance tallies with the account of a U.S. Navy SEAL involved in the raid who later wrote about it in a book. Star: Many in the CIA are reportedly envious of how the female agent is getting so much credit for the assassination of Bin Laden . Matt Bissonnette writes in No Easy Day of flying out to Afghanistan before the raid with a CIA analyst he called ‘Jen’ who was ‘wicked smart, kind of feisty’ and liked to wear expensive high heels. She had devoted the best part of a decade to finding Bin Laden and had become the SEALs’ go-to expert on intelligence matters about their target, he said. And while her colleagues were only 60 per cent sure their quarry was in the compound in Abbottabad, she told the SEAL she was 100 per cent certain. ‘I can’t give her enough credit, I mean, she, in my opinion, she kind of teed up this whole thing,’ Bissonnette said later. The commando saw a very different . side of her days later when they brought Bin Laden’s body back to their . Afghan hangar. Having previously told Bissonnette she didn’t want to see . the body, ‘Jen’ stayed at the back of the crowd as they unzipped the . terrorist’s body bag. She . ‘looked pale and stressed’ and started crying. ‘A couple of the SEALs . put their arms around her and walked her over to the edge of the group . to look at the body,’ wrote Bissonnette. ‘She didn’t say . anything . . . with tears rolling down her cheeks, I could tell it was . taking a while for Jen to process. She’d spent half a decade tracking this man. And now there he was at her feet.’ Although . she remains active as a CIA analyst, it is believed Mark Boal, . Bigelow’s screenwriter, was allowed to interview her at length. It has . emerged that she is in her 30s and joined the CIA after leaving college . and before the 9/11 attacks turned American security upside down.",Three U.S. Senators including John McCain slam Osama bin Laden raid movie Zero Dark Thirty as misleading for its depiction of torture as instrumental in locating the al Qaeda chief .

However, Holly Willoughby may have just worn her most revealing outfit yet as she unleashed her inner vamp at the live final of The Voice on Saturday. The mother-of-two showed off a lot of cleavage - and a lot of leg - in a daring black maxi dress with a naval-grazing neckline and thigh-high split. Taking the plunge: Holly Willoughby shows off some major cleavage in her low-cut dress as she hosts The Voice final . Flashing the flesh: As well as her low-cut neckline, Holly was also showing off plenty of leg thanks to the thigh-high split . The 32-year-old certainly lived up to her 'Willoughbooby' nickname which she was famously given by her Celebrity Juice co-star Keith Lemon. When the live show started on BBC1 on Saturday night, Holly was soon trending on Twitter due to her super sexy outfit. However, she also made headlines for the wrong reasons when she declared Andrea Begley was the winner of The Voice 2003 - instead of 2013. She realised her mistake and later tweeted: 'Well done Andrea!!! Can't wait till 2004! What a year that will be!!! Oops! X.'

Three people have died after a gunman opened fire killing two before shooting himself at Quantico Marine Base last night. Authorities were called to the scene at the Marine Corps Base in Virgina at 10.30pm yesterday and found one Marine dead at a barracks. In the early hours of today they found a second victim dead, along with the body of the suspected gunman, who died of self-inflicted gunshot wound. Scroll down for video . Shooting: The snow covered sign outside the U.S. Marine Base Quantico where three people have been killed . A base spokesman had initially described the situation after the discovery of the first body as a standoff, with the gunman barricaded in the barracks. But officials later clarified that they was no stand-off, and that after the first shooting, police had the shooter 'isolated' in a barracks dorm room at the base's Officer Candidates School. No names have been released but both victims were Marines, one male, one female, according to  Lt. Agustin Solivan. Authorities believe the suspect was a staff member at the officer candidate school at the base. Active service: U.S. Marines march at Camp Pendleton, California . The base was put on lockdown after the shooting but the restrictions have been lifted. The bodies of the suspect and second . victim were discovered when authorities entered the barracks, but . officials have not said what prompted them to move in. A message posted on the base's Facebook page last night told residents to remain in their homes with their doors locked, and to listen for instructions from the 'Giant Voice System' intercom. It read: 'An isolated shooting incident has . occurred at Officer Candidate School. 'The suspect is still . believed to be at large. 'PMO and Prince William County police have been . dispatched.

A remarkable set of family pictures showing the doomed Russian royal family's private moments has been has been found in the vaults of a remote Urals museum. The photographs show the royals in the months and years before Nicholas II was forced to abdicate as the toll of the First World War and the storm clouds of revolution overwhelmed the House of Romanov which had ruled as autocrats for more than 300 years. Two years before the emperor and his family were shot dead by the Bolsheviks on the orders of Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin, he is showing apparently teaching his youngest daughter Grand Duchess Anastasia how to smoke. Newly-discovered pictures show Nicholas II with his 15-year-old daughter Anastasia in Mogilyov, apparently teaching her to smoke . In this 1914 picture, four years before their execution, Nicholas's heir Alexei is seen with sisters Olga, left, and Tatiana, right . Grand Duchess Olga is seen looking through a family album - a neat twist to the newly-discovered photographs of the Romanovs . The princess is seen puffing at the cigarette with every encouragement from the Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias. 'At the time there was not the same stigma attached to smoking,' reports the Siberian Times, which revealed the pictures found in a museum in Zlatoust. 'In fact a year earlier Anastasia had written to her father: ""I am sitting here with your old cigarette that you once gave me, and it is very tasty"".' Another photograph taken by the tsar the same year - 1916 - shows Tsarevich Alexei, heir to an autocratic throne that would be abolished only months later, posing on a tree in winter with his beloved pet spaniel Joy. The boy is also shown playing on a beach with his father. These young royals Anastasia and Alexei would soon be key figures in the mystery of what became of the Romanov family. For decades there were claims, widely believed in the West, that one or both had survived the 1918 shooting. The pictures, including this one of Tsarevitch Alexei are thought to date from the time of the First World War . The grand duchesses Olga and Tatiana are seen posing in the outdoors in this private family photo taken in 1916 . Tatiana is seen again surrounded by flowers as she reads . The execution in Yekaterinburg wiped . out Russia's last royal ruler, his former empress Alexandra, and their . other three children, Olga, Tatiana and Maria. Nicholas II abdicated his throne in 1917 as revolution swept Russia. He and his family were placed under house arrest in Tsarskoe Selo, then evacuated to Tobolsk in the Urals in August that year. The Bolsheviks came to power in October 1917 and by March 1918 the family were forced to live on soldier's rations. The next month, the Red Army moved the Romanovs to Yekaterinburg. There were plans to put Nicholas on trial, but these were scuppered when the city became the target of the rival anti-communist White Army. The Bolsheviks decided to shoot the entire family on July 17 so they could not be rescued by the White Army. They woke them, told them to get dressed and pretended they were being moved from Yekaterinburg away from the oncoming battle. They were shot in a basement and their bodies buried in a pit near the city. Their remains were reburied in 1998 by the Russian government, who gave them a state funeral. In . the event, the scientific analysis of bones found in a forest in the . late Soviet era and subsequently has shown that all were indeed killed . in 1918 when the Reds were concerned that White forces could reach and . free the abdicated tsar and his family. The remains of Anastasia and her brother who perished aged 17 and 13 respectively were, however, buried separately from the rest of the family after their slaying. 'The images of Alexei show a surprisingly strong boy given that his haemophilia saw him portrayed as sickly. 'Indeed it was his serious illness that led his mother to rely on debauched holy man Grigory Rasputin, a relationship that did much to undermine royal credibility as the country became embroiled in an ugly war and revolutionary fervour,' said the Siberian Times. In one of the earlier pictures - snapped by the tsar and his children -  the four carefree Romanov princesses are seen in 1914 aboard the royal yacht Standart on the Black Sea. The same year at Peterhof, the tsar is shown relaxing on rocks in a picture almost certainly taken by one of his children using a camera he had imported from Britain or the US. And in another picture, the Tsar, Alexei and the boy's tutor are seen walking an elephant near their palace in Tsarskoye Selo. A zoo on the estate would be closed after the 1917 revolution, but on this day the ruler wrote in his diary: 'Took the elephant to our pond with Alexei today and had fun watching him bath.' Tsarina Alexandra is seen on a hospital visit to injured servicemen . Grand Duchess Tatiana is seen with an unidentified soldier in another photo from the collection . With war breaking out in 1914, the unfortunate heir is shown in a military game with his tutor's two smaller children. Some of the pictures - including the one of Anastasia smoking - were taken near Mogilyov from where Nicholas II commanded Russian forces during the war. The tsar wanted his family around him. Other pictures show the older princesses visiting wounded soldiers in military hospitals. The images have been released 400 years after the Romanov dynasty came to power in Russia. 'The Emperor was very fond of photography and passed his passion for it to his wife Alexandra and children,' said Milena Bratukhina, an historian at Zlatoust Museum where the album was hidden in Soviet times. Another picture shows Nicholas II and Alexei on a boat in Finland . The pictures, including this of Nicholas II, left, are held at the Zlatoust City Museum . It remains unclear how the several hundred pictures came to be in this remote city. One theory is that the album was taken from the royals by a revolutionary called Dmitry Chudinov, nicknamed Kassian, who was an escort when the exiled royals were brought westward from Tobolsk in Siberia to Yekaterinburg on their final journey before they were shot. He was from Zlatoust and it is known that he appropriated some royal possessions. The album could have been among them.","Nicholas II and family seen in the months and years up to their 1918 deaths .

India's Parliament today passed a sweeping new law to protect women against sexual violence in response to the fatal gang rape of a young bus passenger in New Delhi. The law, which still requires the president's signature before it becomes official, makes stalking, voyeurism and sexual harassment a crime. It also provides for the death penalty for repeat offenders or for rape attacks that lead to the victim's death. Women's rights: The new law has been passed following nationwide protests sparked by the fatal gang rape of a young woman on a bus in New Delhi . Activists hailed the legislation as a milestone in India's women's rights movement, even as they raised concerns over some of its provisions as well as the country's poor record of law enforcement. 'It's a significant moment. We have taken many steps forward,' said Vrinda Grover, a senior lawyer and a women's rights activist. But she added: 'Much, much more needs to be done.' The bill was passed by the upper house of India's Parliament today - two days after the lower house approved it. The law was hurried through Parliament after the gang rape on a young woman on December 16 sparked nationwide protests demanding the government do more to safeguard women. Passed: The parliament building in New Delhi, where the new rape legislation was voted through today . The government set up a panel headed by a retired judge, which recommended sweeping changes to India's laws governing crimes against women. The Cabinet quickly passed an ordinance incorporating some of those suggestions, but Parliament had to pass a new law by next month or the ordinance would have expired. The protection of women in India also came under the spotlight when a Swiss tourists was raped while camping with her husband in Datia district last week. In a separate incident this week, a hotel manager has been accused of attempting to rape a British holidaymaker in the northern city of Agra.

Britain's four leading business groups have voiced their support for Michael Gove’s plan to replace GCSEs with more rigorous exams. They said the tests have failed to prepare a generation of pupils for the world of work – the same argument the Education Secretary has used to justify a schools revolution. The Institute of Directors, the Confederation of British Industry, the British Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses have now all welcomed Mr Gove’s call for a rethink of secondary education. His plans, revealed this week by the Daily Mail, have caused a fierce row in the Coalition as Mr Gove had not discussed them with the Liberal Democrats. Determined: Education Secretary Michael Gove said he will publish a consultation document in mid-July setting out plans to scrap GCSEs and replace them with 'world class exams' Criticism: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said . the school system 'must be for the many not the few' while Labour . schools minister Kevin Brennan said Mr Gove's plans would create a . two-tier system for pupils . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is . furious that Mr Gove wants to bring in a second qualification – which . has been compared to the old CSE – alongside an academically rigorous . O-Level  to give less able pupils a practical qualification that would . be accepted by employers. On Thursday Mr Clegg said this would . create a two-tier system, and vowed to block the plan. Yesterday he . complained that he was kept in the dark, adding: ‘Neither myself nor the . Prime Minister were aware of it.’ David Cameron’s aides dispute this. Mr Clegg said he was committed to . ‘raising standards in our schools’ but insisted any changes would have . to ensure ‘that all children can get ahead through hard work and . aspiration’. Despite Lib Dem complaints, Mr Gove intends to publish a consultation document on the proposals in the second week of July. He has been backed by Mike Harris, . head of education policy at the Institute of Directors, who said: . When will the PM back the plan? ‘Employers are concerned that standards in British exams have slipped, . so action to make qualifications more demanding is welcome. We strongly . support Government reforms to increase standards in all areas of . education.’ However, he said there were still . questions about ‘how this new system would provide a world-class . education for pupils lower down the academic scale’, and stressed: ‘The . name change is far less important than the practicalities of how to . deliver the best qualifications in the world for all young people.’ Neil Carberry, the CBI’s head of . education and skills policy, added: ‘We are concerned that GCSEs in . their current form may not be delivering. With the leaving age for . compulsory education about to change to 18, the time is right to review . the role of a summative exam at 16.' Adam Marshall, director of policy at . the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘Businesses have steadily lost . confidence in the ability of the education system to deliver young . people who are ready for the world of work. If this is a route that . leads more employers to say more young people are ready for the world of . work, then it will have been successful.’ David Pollard, head of the . Federation of Small Businesses’ education committee, added: ‘We want the . Government to seize this opportunity to develop an education system . that places the same importance on quality academic and vocational . education.’ Mr Gove’s consultation is set to be . published in the same week that MPs will discuss Mr Clegg’s plans for . reform of the House of Lords. A Tory MP said: ‘This is a test of Clegg’s . seriousness. If he really backs high standards in schools he should . shut up and back Gove. If he doesn’t, he can wave his Lords reforms . goodbye.’ A source close to Mr Gove defended . plans for two new exams. ‘Some children should not be doing the same . maths course as someone going to do physics at Cambridge,’ they said, . ‘They should be doing a more appropriate course plus quality vocational . training. British pupils have slipped down international league tables in key subjects over the past decade. The most authoritative comparison is the Programme for International Student Assessment carried out by the OECD. It is based on tests given to 15-year-olds in up to 65 countries. When first carried out in 2000, the UK was ranked fourth in science, seventh in literacy and eighth in maths. The science ranking fell to 12th in 2003, 14th in 2006 and 16th in 2009.In literacy the country sank to 11th in 2003, 17th in 2006 and 25th in 2009. The most dramatic slump is in maths, where the ranking was 18th in 2003, 24th in 2006 and 28th in 2009. Critics point out that the sample in the survey has grown across the years, from 43 countries in 2000 to 65 in the last study in 2009. But, even when this is taken into account, the UK has still slipped proportionately down the tables. Under Michael Gove’s plans for a revival, pupils will be able to sit the new O-levels at 16 or 17 and the best pupils will be allowed to bypass the exams and go straight to A-levels. Schools will be given the freedom to enter pupils for the exams when they are ready, rather than forcing everyone to sit them at 16. Modular study will be abolished, with emphasis put on in-depth work and end of year exams rather than coursework that can be redone until it passes muster. Pupils studying English literature will be banned from taking the text of plays into exams and maths pupils will be expected to learn complex subjects such as calculus in order to obtain an A grade. Mr Gove believes the exams need to be tougher to prepare pupils for A-levels, which are also being made more rigorous. Meanwhile, businesses will be asked to draw up a new CSE-style qualification for less able pupils – around one quarter of pupils struggle even to get D or E grades at GCSE. Mr Gove thinks it is pointless to make those children sit the same O-level as those who are preparing to read a rigorous academic subject at Oxford or Cambridge.","Clegg comes out fighting and vows to block the proposals .

Iran is preparing to send 4,000 troops in to Syria to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the wake of America's announcement it will be providing 'military aid' to the country's Muslim rebels. President Barack Obama made the pledge earlier this week after the U.S. claimed it found 'conclusive evidence' Assad's regime has used chemical weapons against the rebel forces - which includes the most extreme Sunni Islamists - and has called for Britain and France to back the move. While Britain hasn't made a . guarantee either way as yet, more than 350 Royal Marines are being sent . to Jordan as part of an 8,000-strong 'multinational exercise', further increasing tensions in the war-torn region. Scroll down to watch video . Concerns: Footage posted on Youtube shows a Syrian rebel with a shoulder-fired heat-seeking missile which can target planes up to 11,000ft in the air - and raising questions over how well-armed forced already are in the country . Risk: The footage has further prompted fears that arming Syria's rebels could cause powerful weapons to fall in to the hands of anti-West extremists . Sources claim the 12-day exercise, called Eager Lion, is part of a plan to have Nato troops on hand for humanitarian ­purposes in Syria. But as the West debates whether to proceed with 'military intervention' in Syria, where 100,000 people have been killed in the last two years, a video has emerged online showing an Islamist fighter using a surface-to-air missile. The footage shows the fighter targeting a helicopter with a shoulder-fired heat-seeking Soviet-era SA-16 missile which can hit planes flying at 11,000ft. It has sparked fears that the arming of moderate rebels will lead to weapons falling in to the hands of extremists who would want to target the West. It comes as the entire Middle East region threatens to plunge into the growing conflict, which has become a hardline divide between the Sunni Muslims and Shiites, after it emerged Iran is preparing to move troops in to Syria to support Assad. Taking action: President Barack Obama, pictured right, has vowed to give 'military aid' to the Syrian rebels - a move which has been welcomed by Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured left earlier this month . More than 100,000 people have lost their lives in the conflict, pictured in Western Dumayna, in two years . The military decision to support Assad was made even before Iran's Presidential election earlier this week, according to The Independent. The entire region is becoming increasingly torn between Sunnis who believe that the father of Mohamed’s wife was the new caliph of the Muslim world and Shias who regard his son-in-law Ali as his rightful successor. America now finds itself on the side of the wealthiest states and Sunni territories of the Arab Gulf - from Egypt to Morocco, Turkey and the British-created monarchy in Jordan. On the other side of the divide is Iran and the largely Shiite Iraq which the West 'liberated' from Saddam Hussein’s Sunni minority in the hope of balancing the power of the region. But as well as causing a divide between the Sunni and Shiite factions of the Middle East, tensions are increasing between America and Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made no secret of his opposition to any move by the West to supply arms to the Syrian opposition. Holding firm: President Bashar Assad has accused the West of backing rebels linked to al-Qaida-linked during his country's civil war . Growing tensions: David Cameron and President Barack Obama will be taking Russia's President Vladimir Putin, pictured together in last year, to task over his support of Syrian President Assad's regime . He responded to the recent lifting of the EU arms embargo by reaffirming his intention to supply President Bashar al-Assad with sophisticated anti-aircraft missiles in order to deter 'hotheads' from intervening in the conflict. And following America's announcement it will provide 'military aid' to Syrian rebels, Assad this weekend suggested on Lebanese TV that Syria may have received the first shipment of an advanced Russian air defence system after Moscow promised S-300 missiles. David Cameron is due to meet with Mr Putin for talks on the Syrian crisis amid fears that differences between Moscow and the West are pushing the two sides towards a new Cold War. David Cameron has been forced by his own backbenchers to promise a Parliamentary vote on Britain providing military support to Syrian rebels . The Russian president has reacted sceptically to evidence produced by Britain, France and the US that the regime has used chemical weapons - crossing Mr Obama's 'red line' for intervention. Mr Cameron has welcomed Mr Obama's announcement, although he has yet to decide whether to follow the president's lead on supplying arms to the rebels. However he said Britain would continue to offer non-lethal support to what he called the 'genuine' opposition - saying it was vital to bolster the democratic elements against the extremists. 'Yes there are elements of the Syrian opposition that are deeply unsavoury, that are very dangerous, very extremist and I want nothing to do with them. I'd like them driven out of Syria - they're linked to al Qaida,' he said in an interview with Sky News's Murnaghan programme. 'But there are elements of the Syrian opposition who want to see a free democratic, pluralistic Syria that respects the rights of minorities including Christians and we should be working with them - we are working with them. 'If we don't work with those elements of the Syrian opposition, then we can't be surprised if the only elements of the Syrian opposition that are getting, that are actually making any progress in Syria, are the ones that we don't approve of. 'After all, they are trying to defend their communities against appalling attacks, including, let's be clear, chemical weapon attacks. President Assad is now guilty of the most appalling crimes against his people - 90,000 people dead and some of them through the use of appalling chemical weapons.' Clash of opinions: Syria will be a major topic at the meeting of the G8 leaders - depicted by members of Oxfam today ahead of the start of the summit . Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi yesterday announced that he was cutting off diplomatic relations with Syria and closing Damascus' embassy in Cairo amid growing calls from hard-line Sunni clerics to launch a 'holy war' against Syria's embattled regime . Even if Mr Cameron were to decide that Britain should start supplying arms, he may find his path blocked in the face of strong opposition in Parliament across all three main parties. The Prime Minister again reaffirmed the commitment wrung out of him by Tory rebels that he would give MPs a vote if he decided Britain should go ahead and arm the Syrian opposition. 'I think Parliament should have a say about these things. I can't really go further than that,' he said. Meanwhile Nick Clegg struck a decidedly cautious tone over Syria today, raising questions about how much support there is in government for David Cameron's increasingly hawkish stance over the conflict. Battle: Syrian rebel fighters belonging to the 'Martyrs of Maaret al-Numan' battalion leave their position after a series of shootings in the northwestern town of Maaret al-Numan earlier this week . Civil war: A vehicle is seen burning in the village of Buweida, north of Qusayr, in Syria's central Homs province as regime forces sought to mop up the final pockets of rebel resistance north of Qusayr earlier this month . Ahead of a meeting between the prime minister and Russian president Vladimir Putin, Clegg told the Andrew Marr programme that arming the rebels was 'not the right thing to do now at this point'. He added: 'We're trying to strike the right balance between playing a part with other allies but not embroiling this country in military conflict in a way I don't think would be acceptable to the British people.' Asked whether the deputy prime minister's more cautious tone suggested the Lib Dems were prepared to oppose intervention in the same way they opposed war in Iraq, Clegg was keen to point out the differences. 'This is not like Iraq and it's different to Libya as well. This is a bloody civil war. The idea we can provide a unilateral British military solution to this is fanciful,' he said. Cautious: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today told presenter Jeremy Vine on Andrew Marr Show that arming rebels is not the right thing to do at 'this time' Former Lib Dem leader Lord Ashdown said it would be 'an act of very considerable folly' to start arming the rebels. He warned that the West risked being drawn into a wider sectarian struggle between Sunni and Shia Muslims who are backed by Iran and Russia. 'This not about Syria. We think Syria is the issue, it's not. It's the front line in a much, much wider struggle,' he told the Murnaghan programme. 'The issue now is not tackling the Great Satan of the West, it is preparing for a war against the Great Heretic in Tehran. 'We are now being inadvertently - and stupidly in my view - instrumentalised into supporting the Sunnis on the one hand while the Russians are being instrumentalised into supporting the Shias. 'I don't believe that it is sensible for us to be contributing to that process.' Now watch video .","350 Royal Marines on way .

Hopes that the dictator's days are numbered grew yesterday when Libya's interior minister abandoned the Gaddafi clan.

Intelligence analysts believe that . visibly destroying the barriers Gaddafi has hidden behind for four . decades will encourage a coup. The known addresses and headquarters of Gaddafi's 10 closest aides have also been targeted to drive him from power. A senior defence source told the Mail . that the plan was based on the Biblical story of the walls of Jericho, . where an invading army wins the day by forcing the city walls to . collapse. 'We are literally making Gaddafi's walls come tumbling down,' the source said. A second MoD source said: 'There are . about 10 people around Gaddafi who matter. We are targeting them too. They know we can get  at them. It makes them think,  “Why am I sticking . with this guy?”' Muammar Gaddafi today urged his supporters to 'get ready to fight' as the rebels began to strangle the Libyan capital of Tripoli by halting food and fuel supplies from Tunisia.

A Pakistani Taliban group has taken taken responsibility for the deadly attack of a mountain climbing camp that left 11 dead including 10 foreign tourists, one of whom was an American. Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ahsanullah Ahsan claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it carried out the shooting as retaliation for the death of the Taliban's deputy leader, Waliur Rehman, in a U.S. drone attack on May 29. The 10 foreigners who were killed included two Chinese, one Chinese-American and one Nepalese, said Attaur Rehman, home secretary in the Gilgit-Baltistan area where the attack took place. The other six have not been identified. One Pakistani was also killed. Revenge: Amid a crush of media, Pakistani rescuers lift a coffin containing a foreign tourist into an ambulance after Taliban militants stormed a mountain climbing base camp and murdered 11 in retaliation for a U.S. drone strike . 'By killing foreigners, we wanted to . give a message to the world to play their role in bringing an end to the . drone attacks,' Ahsan told The Associated Press by telephone from an . undisclosed location. The group claims to have formed a new faction specifically to launch such attacks. The . attack took place at the base camp of Nanga Parbat, the ninth highest . mountain in the world at 26,660 feet. It is notoriously difficult to . climb and known as the 'killer mountain' because of numerous . mountaineering deaths in the past. Death toll: Pakistani airforce personnel carry coffins of foreign tourists, one of which was an American, after airlifting the bodies from a remote mountain base camp in the wake of 11 murders at the hands of the Taliban . Drone war: Ten foreign tourists visiting Pakistan to climb Nanga Parbat (pictured here) and their guide were killed by Taliban gunmen who stormed their hotel during the night in retaliation for a US drone strike . Ultimatum: The normally peaceful, remote area in northern Pakistan has become increasingly violent and a Taliban spokesperson promised more killing of tourists will occur until drone strikes stop . The gunmen were wearing uniforms used by the Gilgit Scouts, a paramilitary police force that patrols the area, said the interior minister. The attackers abducted two local guides to find their way to the remote base camp. One of the guides was killed in the shooting, and the other has been detained and is being questioned, said Pakistani interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan. A senior government official told reporters that a large number of security personnel were sent to Gilgit-Baltistan in the wake of the shooting spree. The government suspended the chief secretary and top police chief in Gilgit-Baltistan following the attack and ordered an inquiry into the incident, said Khan. Officials: Ambassador of the Ukraine to Pakistan, Volodymyr Lakomov, arrives to a hospital where foreign tourists killed in a Taliban ambush at a mountain base camp in Pakistan were taken Sunday . Dangerously high: 10 tourists and a guide were gunned down in their hotel located in northern Pakistan, at the base of the Nanga Parbat (pictured here). The remote tourist spot had been largely peaceful until recently . 'The purpose of this attack was to give a message to the world that Pakistan is unsafe for travel,' said the interior minister in a speech in the National Assembly, which passed a resolution condemning the incident. 'The government will take all measures to ensure the safety of foreign tourists.' Local police chief Barkat Ali said they first learned of the attack when one of the local guides called the police station around 1 a.m. on Sunday. The military airlifted the bodies to Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, Sunday afternoon. Scary sight: A line of ambulances ferry coffins of slain foreign tourists killed in remote northern Pakistan by the Taliban Sunday.

Global issue: Pakistani journalists stand over the coffin of a foreign tourist murdered by a group of Taliban gunmen that stormed a remote mountain climbing camp, killing 11 people from several world nations . 'We hope Pakistani authorities will do their best to find the culprits of this crime,' the Ukrainian ambassador to Pakistan, Volodymyr Lakomov, told reporters outside the hospital where the bodies were taken. Though the area where these shootings took place is relatively quiet, and considered one of the most beautiful regions of the country, this is not the first time those parts have seen violence. The northern Pakistan province was long considered to be on of the country's most secure regions, however, recent attacks from militants targeting Shi'ite minorities have made the area volatile.","Taliban spokesman claims the killings were in retaliation to a May 29 U.S. drone strike .

"By . Daniel Martin and Matt Chorley . PUBLISHED: . 20:35 EST, 15 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:16 EST, 16 April 2013 . Ministers held crisis talks last night to avert a rebellion over David Cameron’s planning ‘free-for-all’ as it emerged it could lead to 40,000 unsightly extensions being thrown up each year. Potential Tory and Lib Dem rebels were invited to a ‘drop-in session’ with planning minister Nick Boles as it emerged that at least 20 MPs are planning to oppose the government in a crucial vote today. Zac Goldsmith, the environmentalist Conservative MP, today tore into the proposals as 'bad, clumsy politics' which will prove deeply unpopular without any evidence that it will solve any problems. Anti plan: Zac Goldsmith, Conservative MP, will vote against the law which will double the length of extensions that people can build in their gardens without planning permission . Coalition backbenchers are furious at the controversial laws which will double the length of extensions that . people can build in their gardens without planning permission. They plan to vote for an amendment allowing local councils to opt out of the relaxed planning rules. Labour is expected to vote for the same amendment, meaning it would take less than 50 rebels to defeat the government. Mr Goldsmith told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It’s a very odd policy and I’m genuinely confused by trying to understand why the Government’s introduced it. 'It will guarantee disputes between neighbours, I don’t think anyone doubts that. 'It will be very unpopular and there’s no evidence, as far as I can see, that it’s going to solve any problems at all. It just seems like very bad, clumsy politics.' A letter from Mr Boles to coalition MPs, seen by the Mail, reveals that his department believes the number of extra extensions going up each year will be double the 20,000 worst-case scenario foreseen by the Local Government Association. Mr Boles’ letter said: ‘Our proposed reforms should make it quicker, easier and cheaper for up to 40,000 families a year wishing to build small-scale single-storey extensions and conservatories, while respecting the amenity of neighbours.’ His offer of talks came as research by local councils found the new rules would allow up to 3million extensions to be built on flood plains. At present, such building work needs planning permission and applications are often turned down because of the risk of extra flooding. Councils are concerned that a raft of extensions in such areas could increase flood risk. Set for fight: David Cameron's planning revolution 'will blight communities and set neighbour against neighbour' MPs warn . Opponents warn that Mr Cameron’s planning revolution - which will extend to 26 feet the maximum length of an extension without the need for permission from the council - will blight communities and set neighbour against neighbour. Last month the House of Lords narrowly passed an amendment to the Growth and Infrastructure Bill, allowing local authorities to opt out of the new planning rules. The amendment was tabled by Lord True, the leader of Richmond-upon-Thames Council in South West London. Conservative councils up and down the country are lobbying their local MPs to urge them to vote for the opt-out amendment when it comes before the Commons today. They include Cheshire West and Chester, Bexley, Tamworth, Richmond-upon-Thames, Croydon and - particularly embarrassing for the government - Lincolnshire Council, the local authority which covers Mr Boles’ Parliamentary seat. And the Royal Town Planning Institute has warned MPs that the new rules could make it impossible to stop neighbours concreting over their entire gardens. Last night Mr Goldsmith said: ‘Everyone wants to see a common sense reforms to planning policy so that uncontentious developments get a green light, and planning officers are able to focus on the cases that matter. ‘But this policy simply rips up all local input and guarantees hostilities between neighbours. It is madness to remove people’s right to object to developments that threaten their homes. ‘The Lords amendment is sensible and modest, and will allow local authorities to decide for themselves if the policy suits their communities. I will back it, and know many of my colleagues will do the same.’ He is expected to be supported by Tory MPs Anne Main, Stewart Jackson and Bob Blackman, and Lib Dem MP Paul Burstow. Mr Blackman said: ‘Permitted development rights are in place to protect neighbours and communities from excessive development. ‘The current limits offer the right balance between preventing unnecessary bureaucracy whilst protecting against poor planning. The changes that have been proposed will damage this balance. ‘In my own constituency, Harrow Council approves only 69 per cent of applications. All of these applications are refused for good reason - applications, which under the proposed changes, could be free to go ahead unchecked.’ Mr Boles, in his letter, said the amendment was not needed because there was already a process which allows councils to opt out of the relaxation of planning rules. However, the LGA said this ‘Article 4’ process is inadequate because it can leave councils open to litigation and can leave them liable to compensation if an extension is refused. Claire Norman, of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ‘We are concerned that, without further safeguards, greater freedom to convert buildings will only risk damaging the unique character and beauty of countryside that won’t replace itself. ‘Planning exists for a good reason. It balances what developers want to do for maximum profit, with what communities want, and what actually works long-term without ruining the environment. ‘If we use the planning process it means controls are applied and this won’t become a free-for-all.’","New law would double extensions allowed without planning permission .

Woody Harrelson's father was a 'hit man' who murdered a Texas carpet saleman and gambler for $1,500, a new book has claimed. Trial lawyer David Berg says he has unearthed new evidence that proves Charles Harrelson was behind the 1968 slaying of his brother Alan Berg - a murder the actor's father was acquitted of in 1970. The book, 'Run, Brother, Run' alleges that, after a business dealing that turned 'vicious,' Harrelson was hired by one of the salesman's rivals to knock him off and claims Berg's girlfriend, Sandra Sue Attaway, was used as a honeytrap in the sinister act. Killer father: Woody Harrelson, pictured right, learned his father, Charles Harrelson, pictured left in 1982, had a dubious profession when he was 12 . According to The New York Post, Berg writes that Attaway lured his brother to a Houston bar called the Brass Jar. Then Harrelson forced Berg into his car at gunpoint and told Attaway to drive to a remote location where he shot his alleged victim in the temple then strangled him after he failed to die. According to Amazon, Berg was only 31 when he disappeared. Six months later his remains were found in a ditch in Texas. Harrelson was acquitted of Berg's murder due to lack of evidence, but David Berg hasn't stopped looking for answers. Four decades later, he writes that his family has uncovered new documents including proof Harrelson's alibi was fake and statements from a witness whom Harrelson confessed to, according to The Post. Berg also says Attaway has outlined each step of the crime she was allegedly an accomplice to in interviews. To hire: Charles Harrelson, pictured in 1960, allegedly kidnapped and killed Alan Berg in 1968 . Art: In 1994, Woody Harrelson, pictured, played a murderer in 'Natural Born Killers' Difficult past: Woody Harrelson, pictured with wife Laura Louie, reconciled with his father despite his profession and absence in his life . Woody Harrelson learned of his dad's dubious profession for the first time at age 12, years after the man had run away leaving his mother to raise him and his two brothers alone. He told The Guardian in 2012 that he heard his father's name mentioned as a suspect in the assassination of US District Judge John H. Wood Jr. outside of his home in San Antonio, Texas. 'I'm sitting there thinking there can't be another Charles V. Harrelson. I mean, that's my dad! It was a wild realization,' he told the newspaper. After two years on the run, Harrelson was arrested and admitted not only to Wood's for-hire murder but also claimed he was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, according to The Post. Despite his dad's occupation and absence in his life, Woody reconciled with his father in the early 1980s and in later interviews described his love for the man. Not about revenge: Trial lawyer David Berg, pictured, says the book is not about revenge but to 'set the record straight' Book: David Berg's book apparently unearths new evidence implicating Harrelson in his brother's murder . 'If you sit down and rap with the guy, the main thing you're probably going to do is laugh,' Woody said in a 1994 interview, the same year the younger Harrelson starred as a crazed murderer in 'Natural Born Killers.' And even David Berg describes the assassin as an intelligent man who could also be 'gentle and romantic.' When his father died of poor health aged 69 in prison in 2007, Woody was said to be 'devastated.' Before his death, he said in a TV interview: 'How do I feel about him? Well I love him. I definitely love him. Very fond of him. I mean, there's probably a lot of people who should be behind bars. I don't necessarily think he's one of them.' But Berg disagrees. He describes Harrelson's acquittal as a 'gross miscarriage of justice' and says the book is not about revenge but about setting 'the record straight.'","A new book by trial lawyer David Berg alleges the actor's father Charles Harrelson was paid to murder his brother, Alan Berg .

A man who challenged himself to do one new thing every day of 2012 to raise money for charity after his wife lost their baby has announced she is expecting again. Richard Roberts, 31, started a blog detailing the one new thing he did every day of the last year - and asked readers to donate a penny for each new thing he did to the Ectopic Pregnancy Trust, after his wife Sian lost their first child. Richard Roberts decided to raise money for the Ectopic Pregnancy Trust after his wife Sian lost their first child. He started a blog detailing the one new thing he did each day of 2012 - here, trying Iranian food . Richard asked readers pf his blog to donate a penny for each new thing he did. Here, being bench-pressed by a friend . After a year of completing tasks from the sublime to the ridiculous - ranging from conducting a philharmonic audience to eating a deep-fried Mars Bar - Richard has raised more than £2,000 for the charity. And yesterday, on the 366th day of his blog, he touchingly announced he had become a dad-to-be, posting a scan of his unborn child. Richard, from Thatcham, Berks, started the blog after kissing his new wife Sian on New Years' Eve 2011 - and realised it was the first time he had kissed his wife in 2012. Down the hatch: Drinking Armadillo milk was another new experience, as was the Man vs Food challenge . He also rescued a piglet and spent a day flying a hawk . He explained on his blog: 'As we drunkenly ushered in the new year in Central London, I grabbed my beautiful wife and gave her a big, lickery kiss! As I did this, I realised I had never brought in the new year by kissing a wife before! 'In my drunken excitement, I informed my pals that I would bravely keep this up for the whole of 2012; trying something new everyday!' After Sian almost lost her life after suffering an ectopic pregnancy, Richard decided to use his resolution to help raise money for the charity which helped them through tough times. He said: 'By the time we got to the hospital Sian had lost so much blood, we were told she was just hours away from death. New acquaintances: Meeting newsreader Jon Snow on a train counted towards Richard's annual tally . The 366 tasks, which ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous, even included a nappy changing contest . After his year of tasks, including trying archery, Richard has raised more than £2,000 for charity . 'I would give anything to have avoided that fateful day. Sadly, that is not possible.' The resulting surgery meant Sian lost one of her fallopian tubes, diminishing the couple's chances of conceiving a baby in the future. Richard's new things ranged from simple deeds - like going to introduce himself to his next-door neighbours, or changing the dirty nappy of a friend's baby. But others were slightly more bizarre - including rescuing an escaped piglet at a children's farm, and chatting to broadcasting legend Jon Snow on the tube. He's also turned his hand to archery, and spent a day handling birds of prey at the Hawk Conservancy Trust. After trying a deep fried Mars Bar, engineer Richard posted: 'I had to have a shower after I finished...and I still felt unclean. Each mouthful took a day of my life.' One particular low point was the deep-friend Mars bar, every mouthful of which Richard described as 'taking a year off my life' Fortunately, his barbequed meat was more palatable . On January 8, he wrote: 'Finally got around to meeting our neighbours properly - Chris, Tracy & Joe. They ROCK!' and posted a photo of him with his new chums. And on May 14th he posted: 'On the train home, Sian and I sat next to the legendary broadcaster, Jon Snow. He had just spent the evening at a charity event at the Royal Albert Hall, in the company of Prince William and Kate. Hmmm. I expect me and Sian were a bit of a disappointment after that! 'Jon Snow was a genuinely lovely fella. I ended up booking him a taxi from Newbury Station - and boring him senseless with this little blog! He seemed startled and confused when I told him that that he was my 'new thing for the day!' But his thousands of followers were touched when on December 31, Richard wrote: 'Became an Expectant Dad!

Yesterday,on the 366th day of his blog, Richard announced he and Sian are expecting again . 'Please remember the reason for me embarking on this bonkers charity project; a few years ago, my wonderful wife, Sian, suffered an ectopic pregnancy. It took the life our wee baby, and it very nearly took my wife's life in the process. The subsequent surgery left my wife bereft on one of her fallopian tubes, thereby diminishing our chances of conceiving in the future. 'Although that fateful incident broke my heart, I was grateful that I still had my wonderful wife by my side! And we never gave up hope! 'And, as this post proves, I am glad we didn't give up- we are now expecting. We have a long way to go, so we aren't counting our chickens before they hatch, but we remain positive!

The Boston Marathon bombs were built inside pressure cookers and packed with shards of metal, nails and ball bearings, it emerged last night. The aim was to cause maximum carnage as red-hot shrapnel tore through spectators and runners. Investigators believe the explosives – which killed three and injured more than 170 – were in six-litre pressure cookers with gunpowder and set off by an electronic timer. Bloodied: Injured runners and spectators lie on the pavement after two bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday . Investigators continue to comb the scene after the horrific attack in Boston . It is believed the six-litre pressure cooker bombs were set off by an electronic timer . The devices are used by terrorists in Afghanistan, are a preferred weapon of al-Qaeda and listed as the ‘most effective’ weapon of jihad. Details of the crude but effective devices emerged as President Barack Obama told the United States to be on the alert for anything suspicious and admitted it was still not known who was responsible. He said the Patriots’ Day blasts were ‘a heinous and cowardly act’ of terror used to target innocent people and promised those responsible would feel the ‘full weight of justice’. But Mr Obama also said it was unclear if the attacks were carried out by an international or domestic organisation, or perhaps by a ‘malevolent individual.’ One of the bombs was placed in a black back-pack before being put on the ground among spectators, the other was left in a dustbin. One may have been triggered by a mobile telephone. The pressure cooker devices have been used in Afghanistan, India, Nepal and Pakistan. At least one was employed in the attempted May 2010 bombing of Times Square in New York by Faisal Shahzad, who admitted he had undergone bomb-making training at a militant Islamist faction camp in Pakistan. However, the Pakistani Taliban, which claimed responsibility for the 2010 attempt in Times Square, has denied any role in the Boston attack. A man kneels praying in front of a makeshift memorial on Boylston Street, Boston . Marathon runners embrace at the gates where three people died and more than 170 were injured in the bombing . Three people, including an eight-year-old boy, were killed and 176 injured, 17 critically, in the blasts near the finishing line of the showpiece event watched on TV by millions across the United States on Monday. Yesterday Richard DesLauriers, of the FBI, said: ‘We will go to the ends of the Earth to identify the subject or subjects who are responsible for this despicable crime.’ Officers, who checked the course before the marathon started, now think the bomber had a ‘three-hour window’ to plant the devices before the blasts and are looking into a number of suspect groups and theories. The include the possibility of a fanatical right-winger or ‘Lone Wolf’. The crude, basic nature of the bombs are said to point towards this and the attack was launched on April 15, tax day in the United States, when the whole nation is expected to file tax returns. Experts speculated right-wingers could have seen the marathon as a liberal, multicultural bonanza worthy of targeting. Significantly, there has been a large rise in the number of anti-government or so-called ‘Patriot’ groups during Mr Obama’s presidency. Monday was Patriots’ Day in the US, a public holiday commemorating the anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775, the first battles of the War of Independence, which would be cause for celebration for such groups. The obvious alternative theory is a foreign terrorist group. Al Qaeda, the Taliban and terrorists linked to the groups have been desperate to carry out a bombing on the US mainland, especially since Special Forces shot Osama Bin Laden dead in his Pakistan hideout. The devices have been used in Afghanistan, India, Nepal and Pakistan but no group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack . The FBI has applied for a warrant to extract the identity of every mobile telephone in the area where the bombings took place . But their efforts have been repeatedly foiled and Monday’s attacks are not thought to be the work of suicide bombers. Al Qaeda and their associates are usually swift to claim responsibility for their attacks but last night no group had come forward. Yesterday the full extent of the horrific injuries suffered by the  victims became clear as Dr George Velmahos, of Massachusetts General Hospital, said his doctors removed ‘a variety of sharp objects,’ including pellets and nails, from the wounds of victims – one had 40 pellets in a leg. His colleague, Dr Stephen Epstein, disclosed an X-ray of one victim’s leg that had ‘what appears to be small, uniform, round objects throughout it – similar in the appearance to ball bearings’. The FBI has applied for a warrant to extract the identity of every mobile telephone in the area where the bombings took place and has requested that all spectators hand over any phone or camera footage to help try to identify any suspects. Last night police said that no one was under arrest but refused to provide any insight into a raid on a residential building in Revere, eight miles north-east of Boston, late on Monday – said to be the home of a Saudi Arabian man. President Obama told the United States to be alert for anything suspicious and admitted it is still not known who was responsible for the Boston bombing . Several large bags were taken from a fifth-floor apartment early yesterday. Police, who confirmed explosives experts had accompanied them in the search, which was done ‘under warrant’, were earlier said to have questioned two men from Saudi Arabia. The leader of the 9/11 attacks and several members of the cells that hijacked four planes were from Saudi Arabia, but officials ‘cautioned’ against putting ‘great significance’ on the raids ‘at this stage’. A 20 year-old student linked to the address is said to be under police guard in hospital, where he is being treated for burns and shrapnel wounds to his legs, after he was tackled to the ground by a civilian who believed he was acting suspiciously. At Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, investigators seized the man’s clothes to examine whether they held any evidence that he was linked to the attack. Law sources told the New York Post that after the man was grabbed by police, he smelled of gunpowder and said, ‘I thought there would be a second bomb’, before asking, ‘Did anyone die?’ By CHRIS GREENWOOD . The Boston Marathon attacks will go down in history as yet another atrocity associated with Patriots’ Day. Investigators fear the timing of the bomb blasts on a day full of significance for many Americans is no coincidence. The celebration of freedom marks the anniversary of the first battles of the American Revolution in 1775 – the ‘shot heard around the world’. But its meaning has been warped by a growing number of white supremacists and other far-Right groups who have turned it into a rallying point. The Boston bombings join a litany of other terrible events connected to the day, including: . Patriots’ Day is April 19, but in Massachusetts and Maine it is commemorated with a public holiday on the third Monday in April. On Monday night, President Barack Obama noted the date, saying: ‘Today is Patriots’ Day – a day that reflects the freedom Boston has celebrated throughout its history.’ Counter-terrorism expert Richard Barrett said the incident had hints of a right-wing attack rather than Al Qaeda-inspired extremism. Mr Barrett said the timing on Patriots’ Day and the relatively small size of the devices suggested the work of a domestic extremist.","Red-hot shrapnel tore through spectators and runners causing carnage .

Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said teachers can empower girls and help them to reject stereotypes . Big business is promoting a ‘raunch culture’ that corrupts young girls, teachers warned yesterday. Playboy bunnies ‘adorn’ children’s pencil cases, pole dancing is portrayed as empowering and beauty pageants have become a staple of student life, they said. As a result, girls are becoming fixated with their figures, with many developing eating disorders and some diabetics even shunning insulin to stay slim. The bleak assessment that sexism has reversed women’s liberation was laid out at the National Union of Teachers’ conference in Liverpool. Sara Tomlinson, from Lambeth in south London, said: ‘Big business has taken the liberation we fought for and is selling it back to us at a huge cost. ‘We are seeing a rise in cosmetic surgery, a fixation with body sizes, the selling of Playboy merchandise and pole dancing kits to younger and younger children.’ Bristol delegate Sharon Anderson said: ‘We are now seeing the repackaging of sexual liberation, with it being re-sold to women in the form of raunch culture.’ 'This has triggered widespread anxiety and low self-esteem among girls, she added. The Daily Mail has reported that shops have been caught selling dubious products to children including padded bras and underwear with suggestive messages. An NUT motion stated: ‘The objectification of women’s bodies is playing an ever more horrifying role in society and is having a disastrous effect upon the self-image of girls and young women. 'Growing up in a world where it is normal for women’s bodies to be seen as sex objects affects the way that girls in our schools grow to view themselves and their place in society. ‘Girls are coming under unprecedented pressure to conform with unrealistic physical and sexual ideals and modifying their behaviour because of contact with adult material.’ Women's liberation has been turned back 40 years by a new 'raunch culture' that has led to pole-dancing exercise classes, teachers are expected to claim today .

The gunfight was caught on surveillance video and has once again sparked the debate on gun ownership in the U.S. during Barack Obama's presidency. Mr Obama faces resistance from the gun lobby in the U.S., where the number of firearms held by civilians is estimated at 270million. People believe they should be allowed to own a gun for protection. But thousands support Mr Obama's call for a ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines as well as for universal background checks for gun sales. They also want lawmakers to require gun safety training for all buyers of firearms.

A former aide to Mayor of London Boris Johnson who admits to having a 'strange sex life' was today cleared of possessing extreme pornography 'likely to cause serious injury'. Simon Walsh, 50, smiled as he was acquitted by a jury at at Kingston Crown Court while a handful of his supporters gasped and cried with relief in the witness box. The gay barrister, who was also a member of the City of London Corporation, was accused of sending and receiving 'obscene' pornographic photos on a personal email account. Relief: Simon Walsh, 50, leaves Kingston Crown Court with a friend after being cleared today . Today a jury of six men and six women took just 90 minutes to dismiss the five counts of possessing an extreme pornographic image, and one count of possessing an indecent picture of a child. Some of the charges related to photos he took of him and two other men at a New Year's Eve sex party. Jurors accepted Mr Walsh's insistence . that the photos were not extreme or pornographic and his denial that anyone had been hurt. He said he had the New Year's Eve party images 'as a record of what we have done', adding: 'I know the . limits and I respect them.' Mr Walsh was also cleared of receiving emails containing photos of other men engaged in 'extreme' sex acts, as well as an allegation that one of the men in the collection of photos was underage. Judge Nicholas Price QC said: 'He can now be discharged.' Opening the trial at Kingston Crown Court, prosecutor Thomas Wilkins said: 'Pornography is extreme and therefore illegal if it is grossly offensive, disgusting or otherwise obscene and shows and activity likely to cause serious injury.' He called Mr Walsh 'a gay man who has what he described as a strange sex life'. Career damage: Mr Walsh was fired by London mayor Boris Johnson, pictured, after the charges emerged . However Mr Walsh said that those who attended the New Year's Eve party were responsible for safety, adding: 'It was not like a safety announcement when a plane takes off, but people know if it hurts you say ""ouch"" and it stops.' Asked by Mr Wilkins if he could recall anyone being hurt during the party, Mr Walsh replied: 'Not at all.' He added: 'During the whole of the evening nobody expressed any discomfort at all... I accept there is a remote possibility that they may both be dead, but I think that is highly unlikely.' Mr Walsh, who was once tipped to stand as a mayoral candidate, said today that being wrongly accused of possessing extreme porn had damaged his 'career and personal standing.' He spoke shortly after he was unanimously cleared by the six male and six female jurors, praising their 'common sense' verdict. Mr Walsh also urged prosecutors 'not to prosecute individuals in possession if images depicting private and consensual adult sexual acts.' His solicitor Myles Jackman said his client was 'exhilarated' by the acquittal. 'Right to a private life': Walsh thanked the jurors at Kingston Crown Court, pictured, for their 'common sense' verdict . Reading a statement on behalf of Mr Walsh, he said: 'Today I was unanimously acquitted by a jury at Kingston Crown Court of five charges of being in possession of extreme pornography despite the images depicting acts which are legal to perform, and an extremely damaging allegation of being in possession of child porn in respect of a single image sent to me unrequested via email over three years ago which the jury had no difficulty deciding was in fact a picture of an adult. 'I would like to commend the jury for their common sense verdict, my legal team for their robust efforts and all the support I have received from the general public. 'I would like to take this opportunity to encourage our legislators and regulators not to prosecute individuals in possession of images depicting private and consensual adult sexual acts. - SIMON WALSH . 'Nonetheless, these allegations have . damaged my career and personal standing. As I said in my evidence I do . not believe that when I stood for public office I gave up my right to a . private sexual life. I reiterate that point now. 'I hope to return to public life as soon as possible. I have no further comment to make at this time.' His solicitors today condemned the . 'dreadful' ordeal he had suffered as he was unanimously acquitted of all . charges at Kingston Crown Court. Samira Noor-Khan, a partner at Hodge . Jones & Allen, said: 'This case highlights the dreadful state of . affairs where people can be prosecuted for possessing images of adults . legally participating in consensual sexual acts. 'Simon’s personal life was placed under extreme scrutiny and his career ruined on the basis of a handful of images found on his email server.' However, the Crown Prosecution Service insisted there had been 'sufficient evidence' to bring the matter to trial. A CPS spokesperson said: 'Possession of images that depict acts likely to cause serious injury is illegal and the CPS prosecutes the law as it stands. We do not make the law and cannot change it. 'This case was not about the practice itself, but was based on the evidence of medical experts who said the way the acts were performed was likely to cause serious injury or harm. 'We therefore concluded that there was sufficient evidence to prove this offence and that the matter should, therefore, be put before a jury to decide.'","Charges of having 'extreme' images and an indecent image of a child dismissed in unanimous verdict .

Kelly Kociela leaving Bristol Magistrates' Court after biting a teacher while trying to pick her children up from school . A mother who bit a teacher after turning up drunk at her children's school has been banned from entering the playground. Kelly Kociela, 32, had drunk lager and rum before arriving at Filton Avenue Junior and Infant School in Horfield, Bristol ‘distressed and slurring,’ the town's magistrates' court heard. Kociela was held back by teachers as she tried to push her way into a school building to reach her children at an after-school club. When teacher Matthew Cox tried to block her path, she bit him on the arm. The court heard how Mr Cox then went to hospital and was given precautionary tetanus and hepatitis B injections after the attack at 6pm on October 24 last year. Kociela, of Horfield, Bristol, was arrested and taken to Southmead police station where she told officers that she had drunk three or four pints of Stella and four rum and cokes before she argued with her partner and decided to collect her children. She told police she could not remember being at the school, that she normally got on with headteacher Rachel Thomas and could not remember biting Mr Cox. She pleaded guilty to a charge of causing a nuisance on school premises, assault and using threatening words and behaviour on a previous occasion. Mary Aquilina, prosecuting, said Kociela turned up at the school demanding to see her two children. Ms Aquilina said: ‘She was aggravated and aggressive saying her children had been taken from her. ‘The headteacher Rachel Thomas was concerned about the safety of her staff and the children at her school.’ Kociela then went to the after-school . club threatening Mrs Thomas that if she did not give her her children, . she would ‘batter’ her, Ms Aquilina said. On her arrival at the after-school club doors Mr Cox put his arm across the door to block her entry. Ms Aquilina said: ‘She tried to push past him, then bit him through his clothing on his right arm. He attended Southmead Hospital where he was given tetanus and hepatitis B jabs.’ Attack at school: Kociela (pictured) bit teacher Matthew Cox's arm as he blocked the entrance to the after-school club where her children were - he had to go to hospital for a tetanus and hepatitis B injection . Liz Highams, defending, said her client immediately rang the school after the incident to apologise for her behaviour but was currently banned from going on the premises. The court heard that Kociela had stopped drinking and was ‘mortified’ by her behaviour that day. Miss Highams said the reporting of . the matter in the press had caused her and her children a great deal of . stress describing it as ‘more than damaging’. Magistrates . handed Kociela a two-year community order and she was ordered to pay . £100 compensation to Mr Cox, £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge. Kociela may only go to the school if invited but can collect her children from the school gates.

On the basis, presumably, that if you can’t beat them, join them, elders from the Mormon church have paid for three full-page ads in the programme for the new hit West End show The Book Of Mormon. Which is somewhat surprising, considering that from start to finish the bad-taste musical mercilessly lampoons the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, whose devotees famously include Donny Osmond. Clearly, they have taken the ‘any publicity is good publicity’ route and hitched their wagon to this unstoppable juggernaut. The Book of Mormon has been lauded by most critics. Pictured in white shirts is Gavin Creel (centre) and Jared Gertner (back right) The crude show has broken box office records in the West End . Tickets for the foul-mouthed show, which makes fun of raping babies and female genital mutilation, are like gold dust. Already, it has broken West End box office records, taking more than £2 million in advance bookings in a single day, following its official opening at the end of last month. The sales record was broken after producers released a further 150,000 tickets. Even so, it is now almost impossible to find a spare seat through official channels until July. Meanwhile, unofficial websites are selling a pair of tickets for later this month for a staggering £750. Already, the run has been extended until January and the London PR agency hired by the show’s American producers, let slip to me this week they are looking to  emulate another West End hit, We Will Rock You, which has been running for 11 years. And the touts are not the only ones cashing in. The Prince of Wales theatre, where The Book of Mormon is showing, has just put up its prices because of the high demand — with the best seats going for £72.50. At the same time, highbrow critics are  falling over themselves to find ever more fawning superlatives for the musical, which has won nine Tony Awards on Broadway. One hyperventilating female reviewer from the Guardian wrote: ‘It’s simply a work of genius, so brilliantly conceived and executed that it makes astonishingly savage and sophisticated satire into joyous, hilarious, literally all-singing, all-dancing fun and glamour. And the Observer’s critic trilled that it is: ‘The most cryingly good night out to have come along in years.’ Not everyone agrees, however. The . Mail’s Quentin Letts described the show, which follows two clean-cut . Mormon missionaries sent to poverty-stricken Uganda, as ‘cowardly, . coarse and cynical’. And . Libby Purves in The Times wrote: ‘Beneath its jollity, [Mormon] is . morally null and — without seeming to notice it — pretty racist.’ One . undeniable thing is that The Book of Mormon — written by the American . creators of equally controversial adult television cartoon South Park — . is fast becoming the most hyped show in theatre history. Behind . its success on both sides of the Atlantic is a multi-million- dollar . publicity and marketing campaign on a scale not normally seen beyond the . realms of a Hollywood blockbuster movie. Industry sources in America — where . there is a touring version of the show, plus long-standing productions . in New York and Chicago — say producers have spent an unprecedented . $1 million (£650,000) marketing the show in London alone. As . well as a flurry of double-page national newspaper adverts featuring . glowing reviews, there is a high-profile Facebook and Twitter campaign . to get the message out. Book Of Mormon creators Matt Stone (left) and Trey Parker at last year's BAFTA awards in California . And on suburban railway stations . around the London area a poster campaign has been launched featuring the . gushing tweets of what purport to be ordinary members of the public who . have seen the show. Top London theatre marketing firm Dewynters has been brought in with PR consultancy The Corner Shop to oversee the strategy. The . theatre is also holding a daily lottery, where 21 ‘lucky’ punters, who . pay £20, have their names drawn from a tombola to win a ticket for that . night’s show. Mike Paul, one . of the most high-profile PR men in New York, where The Book Of Mormon . is about to enter its third year on Broadway, told me: ‘The marketing . campaign has been brilliant. The producers have treated this show in the . way Hollywood sells its biggest movies, and thrown millions of dollars . at it. What they are saying to the public is that this show is sold out . for months. Therefore it must be great. ‘Theatre-goers might know absolutely . nothing about the material, but they think to themselves, “I don’t want . to be the only person I know who is not going to see this show.” ’ Those who do manage to get a ticket should be ready for blasphemy and profanity by the bucketload. The . story follows two naive young Utah Mormons, Elders Price and . Cunningham, played by Gavin Creel and Jared Gertner, who travel to an . Aids-ridden African village to  convert the locals. Subtle . it is not. One song, a spoof of the ditty Hakuna Matata, from Disney’s . The Lion King, has the natives belting out an F-word strewn two-fingered . salute to God which includes lines such as, ‘**** you, God’ and ‘**** . you in the ****.’ Elsewhere, there is a blood-drinking . warlord who believes in female circumcision and that raping babies can . cure Aids. Later one of the Mormon evangelists persuades the locals the . disease can, in fact, be eradicated by indulging in bestiality. The Prince of Wales Theatre has put up its prices because of the high demand for seats . As one of the first to see the show in London, I can attest it is, indeed, vile, offensive and potty-mouthed. Which might be forgivable were it not also puerile, crass and — worst of all — not very funny. But it must be conceded that on the evidence of the hysterical reaction of the audience at the preview I attended, I am in the minority. It all depends on your definition of high comedy. I found it surreal sitting stony-faced while those around me dissolved into paroxysms of laughter over an African — who looked like he was straight out of Central Casting — shouting over and over: ‘I have maggots in my scrotum’. Yet, already there has started a rather sinister online campaign against anyone who doesn’t fall over themselves to praise the show. Recently, the Guardian’s Michael . Billington, who wrote a mildly flattering review, complained: ‘Is there . something a bit bullying about Book Of Mormon aficionados? Can’t one be . sceptical about a Broadway hit without being a snob? Nonetheless, . a fightback of sorts has begun. In the U.S., the travel website . Tripadvisor is full of theatre-goers appalled by the near-the-knuckle . nature of the production. Meanwhile, a Stateside Facebook page entitled, . The Book Of Mormon Show Sucks, has sprung up. But the truth is that anyone who has ever watched South Park couldn’t complain that they did not know they were letting themselves in for a no-holds-barred gross-fest  simply by buying a ticket. Behind the musical are writers Trey . Parker, 43, and Matt Stone, 41, who created South Park in 1997. They . have become vastly rich on the back of the cartoon series and now The . Book Of Mormon. Each man is reported to have amassed a fortune of around . £200 million. And they . are expanding their powerful business empire. In January they signed a . deal with multi- millionaire former Goldman Sachs financier Joseph . Ravitch to launch their own Hollywood film production company, Important . Studios. They plan to rival Steven Spielberg’s DreamWorks and Lucasfilm, makers of Indiana Jones and Star Wars. Even before the London opening, The Book of Mormon was a massive money-spinner. With the West End show added to three productions in the States, Parker, Stone and fellow producer Scott Rudin are raking in just over £4 million a week. Matt Stone and Trey Parker already had great success with their near the knuckle humour in South Park . The duo made their name with South Park, . which follows the fortunes of a gang of schoolboys in a fictional . Colorado backwater, and purposely set out to shatter virtually every . remaining television taboo. Among South Park’s list of targets are . the disabled, Jews, gays, Catholics, Scientologists and the rich and . famous. Controversial storylines includes one from 2007 which showed a . cartoon of the Queen blowing her brains out after a failed attempt to . invade America. Another episode showed  Indiana Jones actor Harrison Ford being raped several times by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. But . the writers’ self-styled reputation for taking on powerful vested . interests was dealt an embarrassing blow two years ago, before an . episode which featured an image of the prophet Muhammad. A little known New York-based Islamic website, called Revolution Muslim, warned that the show’s two creators faced being murdered if the depiction went ahead. Despite the radical group having no more than ten official members, the South Park producers caved  in. The images of Muhammad  were covered by a ‘censored’ sign and references to him were bleeped out. The episode still featured a cartoon of Buddha snorting cocaine and Jesus downloading internet porn. Likewise, the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is clearly an easier target than radical Islam. Even so, producers were so frightened of reprisals they insisted on strict security at the London theatre rehearsals of the musical, with guests having to sign in and mail strictly checked for suspect devices. As it turned out, the good-natured Mormons decided to see the funny side of theatre’s crudest and most over-hyped show of all time. But how long will it be before audiences who have paid a small fortune to see it start to feel it is a case of the emperor’s new clothes?","Tickets for the show are like gold dust and sales have broken records .

Former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell, who quit the Cabinet after a media storm over his foul-mouthed row with police, has been hired to advise others on how to protect their reputation. The senior Conservative MP will be paid £3,000-a-day as a 'senior adviser' to Montrose Associates, which specialises in helping clients deal with 'political and reputational threats'. Mr Mitchell quit the government last year amid claims he called police 'f****** plebs' in a row about riding his bicycle through the gates of Downing Street, a phrase he denies using. Former chief whip Andrew Mitchell is confident a prosecution review of the evidence in the 'Plebgate' row will back his version of events . He resigned in October after a police . log, which appeared to corroborate the officers’ account, was leaked. Scotland Yard is investigating his claim that the allegations were . concocted. Preliminary findings are expected to be released within days. However, the controversy has not stopped Mr Mitchell adding to his £65,000 role as an MP. In addition to his one-day-a-month role with Montrose, revealed in his entry in the register of MPs' interests, he also earns £3,000-a-day as a member of the the advisory board of a 'growth and innovation consultancy' called The Foundation. He expects to commit six days a year to the job. The revelation of his new job comes after it emerged Mr Mitchell is demanding an apology from Theresa May after privately accusing the Home Secretary of masterminding his exit from Government over ‘Plebgate’. He is convinced he lost his job last autumn because of a police conspiracy – and that Mrs May was instrumental  in turning the Cabinet against him when his fate hung in  the balance. And he also believes she let her view that his position had become untenable become known to the media. Former Chief whip Andrew Mitchell (right) wants a personal apology from Theresa May (left) because he believes she turned Cabinet members against him during the 'Plebgate' row . Mr Mitchell wants Mrs May to personally apologise for ‘prejudging’ him. He believes she told colleagues he should not remain in his job because his continued presence was damaging the Government. He claims to have proof she briefed journalists to that effect. When Mrs May was asked at the time whether she had been in the ‘vanguard’ of efforts to force him to step down, she said: ‘I’m not going to talk about private conversations.’ A friend of Mr Mitchell said last night: ‘There are many at Westminster who feel it would be nice if those who got it so wrong were to acknowledge that.’ A spokeswoman for Mrs May declined to comment. Mr Mitchell, who is supported by powerful figures including former party leader Michael Howard and ex-Shadow Home Secretary David Davis, is confident a prosecution review of evidence gathered by Operation Alice, the Scotland Yard investigation into claims of police fabrication, will back his version of events. A Channel 4 investigation cast doubt . on the initial police account when it revealed that CCTV footage showed . there was not a large group of tourists outside the gate during the row, . as was originally claimed.

Having to keep the peace between family, friends, ex-partners and mothers-in-law over the fraught festive period is familiar to many of us. If you’re super-rich pop svengali Simon Cowell, there’s only one solution: throw money at it. Over the past two weeks, Cowell is thought to have spent £750,000 on keeping both his mother Julie and his on-off girlfriend Mezhgan Hussainy happy in the Caribbean. During Christmas week, for example, which Cowell and his entourage spent on the island of Antigua, the impresario put Julie, 85, in a £2,000-a-night hotel suite. Meanwhile, 39-year-old Mezhgan, Simon’s ex-fiancée, was anchored 200 yards offshore on a lavish private yacht. Does she lack the X Factor? Simon Cowell only has eyes for his Top Gear magazine and mobile phone while holidaying this week with his ex-fiancee Mezhgan Husseiny . Simon Cowell is thought to have spent £750,000 on keeping his mother and on-off girlfriend happy in the Caribbean . The cost of this operation? Well, let’s just say that Cowell won’t have had much change from £350,000. And even that figure amounts to less than half of the £750,000 the entire three-week holiday is likely to have cost him by the time he gets home. First, there is the £270,000 cost of hiring the 196ft, super-yacht Slipstream for a week. This floating palace can accommodate 12 people and is staffed by 14 crew to attend to the X Factor supremo’s every whim. Then there is the bill for putting his mother in the Carlisle Bay hotel, where rooms start at £740-a-night. On top of that is the bill for business class flights Cowell paid to bring everyone together. But with a net worth thought to be upwards of £225 million, he can afford such extravagances. Indeed, it was reported yesterday that newly filed accounts showed his TV firm had doubled earnings last year — income was up £20 million in America and £26 million in the UK. On the New Year’s leg of his holiday in his traditional winter haunt of Barbados, he installed Miss Hussainy and another ex-lover, Eighties singer Sinitta, in a shared palatial apartment at a cost of a £20,000 a night. Simon Cowell and makeup artist Mezhgan Hussainy arrive at the 18th annual Elton John AIDS Foundation's Oscar Viewing Party . Nor are they the only ones benefiting from his largesse. As well as Sinitta’s two adopted children, the private complex where he has been staying has played host to a freewheeling contingent of guests — including several young men with perfectly tanned, hairless bodies, laid on as eye candy for Sinitta and Mezhgan — who have been sunning themselves by his pool. The only person missing from the party is Cowell’s current girlfriend, 40-year-old Playboy model and former Baywatch star Carmen Electra, who he recently described as ‘adorable’, though not adorable enough, clearly, to accompany him and his exes on holiday. At the centre of this gathering is Cowell, 53, orchestrating proceedings and playing benevolent host. Although he often sees in the New Year in Barbados, this year he has upgraded from his usual suite of rooms at the island’s five-star Sandy Lane hotel. While the hotel has, at various times, welcomed Frank Sinatra, Jackie Onassis, Mick Jagger and the Queen, Cowell has deemed the old Sandy Lane not quite smart enough for him. This year he has checked into the hotel’s new and even more luxurious sister property, One Sandy Lane, which makes the ritzy original seem like a Travelodge by comparison. The extended Cowell clan is staying in a £16 million purpose-built suite, one of eight lavish dwellings in the complex, built out of local coral stone and with its own private beach. His apartment has 14ft-high ceilings, Italian marble floors, ebony and walnut fittings and five bedrooms, all with en suite bathrooms. Central to its appeal is its privacy. The complex boasts a security centre in the basement that operates on biometrics — typically retina-scanning or fingerprinting — meaning guests don’t need room keys. Any autograph hunters, unwelcome fans or paparazzi immediately set off the sophisticated alarm system. There is also a private butler and a chef (who has been making healthy green smoothies and skinny muffins for Cowell, who is determined not to put on weight before filming begins on the new series of Britain’s Got Talent in mid-January). Annual getaway: Simon played with his short locks as Mezhgan adjusted her bikini top . Tools for the perfect tan: Simon made sure to apply a coating of sun protector during his lounging session . He also has a personal trainer — Nigel — to put him through a twice-daily workout in the private gym.Which is not to say there hasn’t been time for chilling out with friends such as one-time WAG Lizzie Cundy — who is ‘celebrating’ her divorce from former Chelsea footballer Jason — and another long-time chum, showbiz agent Jonathan Shalit, who are both staying on the island. But even close friends wonder why Cowell has chosen to spend his holiday with Mezhgan, an Afghan-born, Los-Angeles-raised make-up artist. After all, within months of presenting her with a £250,000 diamond ring from jeweller’s Graff following their engagement on Valentine’s Day 2010, he had summarily called off their wedding, dubbing the whole thing a ‘big mistake’. It was believed he couldn’t tolerate her jealousy over his close relationships with several of his ex-girlfriends. Nor was he prepared to compromise on his obsessive work routine. In a best-selling biography of Cowell, published last spring, journalist Tom Bower told a story that added insult to Miss Hussainy’s injury. Bower revealed that not long after the engagement, Cowell returned home late one night from recording American Idol, on which he was a judge, and found himself having an argument with Mezhgan. His furious fiancée lashed out at him, in front of his widowed mother. Julie is quoted in Bower’s book as saying: ‘The tension was horrendous. The way Mezhgan behaved made my stomach churn.’ Within weeks, the engagement was off. Cowell, however, believes in maintaining good relations with his former girlfriends. He gives them access to his large chequebook, and in return they don’t blab embarrassing secrets about their time together. He and Mezhgan are reconciled sufficiently to holiday together. And Mezhgan isn’t the only ex-girlfriend keeping Cowell company. Despite splitting from him in 2006, Sinitta has been a regular holiday companion, happily lining up on the sun loungers next to other old flames such as Jackie St Clair and Terri Seymour.

On the New Year¿s leg of his holiday in his traditional winter haunt of Barbados, Cowell installed Miss Hussainy and another ex-lover, Eighties singer Sinitta, in a shared palatial apartment at a cost of a £20,000 a night . She flew out to join Simon on his yacht three days before Christmas with her children, Magdalena, seven, and five-year-old Zac. Their . host later had the task of explaining to the children how Father . Christmas managed to get on to the boat and leave presents for them on . Christmas morning. All this . week, Sinitta — who is due to travel on to St Barts with Cowell over . the coming days — has been posting breathless Tweets about her partying . till as late as 7am with the man she calls ‘Silly Simon’. Sinitta, who . says she is 44, has also posted pictures of at least two of the young . men, in their early 20s, who have been part of Cowell’s loose party of . guests, referring to them jokingly as her ‘toy boys’. Certainly, . they have all been treated royally by their host. When one handsome lad . — who had earlier been photographed in a pair of lurid pink trunks . larking on the steps of the property with Sinitta — flew home to London, . he was taken to the airport in a top-of-the-line Range Rover Sport. Cowell, who has denied claims made by Bower that he had a breakdown in . the summer, has looked relaxed in photographs taken during this long . Caribbean break. Hussainy showed off her immaculate bikini body as she laid by Simon . Wearing a collarless white shirt slashed open almost to the waist, he joined revellers at a party at Sandy Lane to see in the New Year, posing gamely for pictures with a New York-based, Essex-born male model called James Taylor. On Thursday he was photographed reclining on the deck of his yacht reading a copy of Top Gear magazine while Mezhgan lay beside him in a turquoise snake-print bikini drinking a cocktail. But this holiday could be the calm before the storm. Simon faces a tough year as he attempts to restore ‘Brand Cowell’ to its former glory after both the UK and U.S. versions of The X Factor slumped in the ratings. A disappointing 9.3 million tuned in to the final of the British series last month, 1.3 million fewer than the previous year. Meanwhile, in the States, the show was trounced by The Voice and he faces having to sack Britney Spears, whom he signed as a judge for the most recent season, but who has proved unpopular with viewers. Even on this most relaxing of holidays, there has been a sense of storm clouds gathering. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, there have been tense words between Mezhgan and Sinitta. It wasn’t hard to spot the stiff body language when the two women flanked their host at a charity auction for the island’s Hope Sanctuary animal welfare centre the other night. There will be those, of course, who say that by inviting his former lovers on his £750,000 getaway, Cowell is only getting what he deserves. This article has been amended to reflect concerns raised about references to Mrs Cowell.","X Factor boss hosts on-off girlfriend Mezhgan Hussainy and mother Julie .

"By . Alex Gore . PUBLISHED: . 08:17 EST, 22 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:06 EST, 22 March 2013 . Russia has urged the world's other major emerging economies to join forces to counter Western clout. President Vladimir Putin, a frequently critic of Europe and the U.S., said the BRICS - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - should broaden their role and get more involved in geopolitics. His comments come as China's new communist leader sent a defiant signal to the U.S. and Europe today as he arrived in Russia with his first lady on . his first foreign trip as president. Signal: President Xi Jinping and wife Peng Liyuan arrive in Moscow on the first foreign visit of his presidency . VIP: The visitors from China were given the red carpet treatment when they arrived in Russia today . Important guests: Xi Jinping and his first lady arrived at Vnukovo Airport outside Moscow today . The visit by Xi Jinping . underlines the importance of Beijing's growing alliance with Moscow and . will do little to thaw the two countries' difficult relationships with . the West. Russia is the . world's largest energy producer and China is it biggest consumer, and . together the two nations are looking to bolster a financial and geopolitical counter weight to Washington. Mr Putin was speaking before a summit next week of the group, which also includes Brazil, India and South Africa. It comes amid creasing fears of growing Russian influence in Europe through its dealings with bankrupt Cyprus. He told news agency Itar-Tass that the BRICS members were working on joint declarations on the conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan, Iran's nuclear programme, the situation in the Middle East and other issues. First lady: Peng Liyuan smiled as she stepped of the plane alongside her husband earlier today . 'We invite our partners to gradually transform BRICS from a dialogue forum that coordinates approaches to a limited number of issues into a full-scale strategic cooperation mechanism that will allow us to look for solutions to key issues of global politics together,' Putin said according to a Kremlin transcript of the interview. BRICS leaders are expected to use the March 26-27 meeting in Durban, South Africa to endorse plans to create a joint foreign exchange reserves pool and an infrastructure bank, senior emerging market officials said on Thursday. Putin, who wants more for foreign investment to bolster Russia's economy, said Russia plans to announce the creation of a BRICS Business Council to promote trade and investment within the group and help launch multilateral business . Today's visit by Xi Jinping is also set against a backdrop of the United States' 'Asia pivot' strategy of additional focus on the region in areas such as trade, investment and military presence and alliances, which worries Beijing. Mr Xi will meet Mr Putin later and they could preside over deals that would make Beijing Russia's top customer for oil - although they are not expected to sign a long-sought agreement on supplies of pipeline gas to China. Just before Mr Xi's arrival with first lady Peng Liyuan, a $2 billion deal (£1.3bn) was announced by Russian and Chinese companies to develop coal resources in eastern Siberia, which underlined the countries' intentions. Mr Putin has said he wants to 'catch the Chinese wind in our economic sail' and that desire will grow stronger if China overtakes the U.S. as the world's largest economy during Mr Xi's 10-year term. Perhaps symbolically, Mr Xi's visit overshadowed a meeting Russian government leaders and the European Union's Commission also taking place in Moscow. Guard of honour: The Chinese president is greeted by an official welcome ceremony at the airport . Growing alliance: Today's visit by Xi Jinping underlines the importance of Beijing's relationship with Moscow . Friendship: Mr Xi, 59, has fondly recalled how he read Russian literature in his younger days . The two leaders, less than a year apart in age, echoed one another in interviews before the visit, each saying the Chinese leader's choice of Moscow as his first destination was evidence of the 'strategic partnership' between the nations. A smiling Mr Xi, 59, recalled that he read Russian literature in his younger days. Mr Putin, 60, said Russian-Chinese relations were at 'the best in their centuries-long history'. The two U.N. Security Council members' solidarity on important global issues has strengthened in recent years. Landmark visit: The communist leader attended a ceremony at Moscow's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier . They have joined forces three times to block Western-backed measures on the conflict in Syria despite talk of grumbling in Beijing, and Russia has followed China's lead on North Korea - two issues likely to come up in Friday's talks. They have negotiated alongside the West on Iran's nuclear programme, but have watered down past sanctions in the Security Council and opposed new punitive measures as counterproductive. Russia has added to Japan's woes over territorial disputes with Beijing by playing up its control of an archipelago claimed by Tokyo. Beijing and Moscow have also stood side-by-side in rejecting Western criticism of their record on human rights. But the lockstep movement on the global stage has not translated into easy agreement on bilateral energy deals, underlining the limits that persist in the relationship. A huge business complex on the edge of Moscow, decorated with Chinese paintings and red silk armchairs, is the kind of enterprise Mr Xi wants to nurture in Russia. A jumble of Chinese and Russian firms, a 400-room hotel and conference venues sprawl over the 77 square mile, $350 million (£2.3m) Greenwood complex. It was built by a Beijing-controlled consortium with materials shipped from China. Mr Xi's presidency is seen as a chance to put new impetus into such projects and into ties with Russia as a whole. Mr Putin said this week that bilateral trade had more than doubled in five years and reached $87.5 billion (£58m) in 2012 - although it is about five times smaller than Russia's with the European Union, and far smaller than China's trade with the U.S. Overshadowed: Vladimir Putin pictured yesterday with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso . Tough talk: Russia and Europe officials have been meeting at Mr Putin's Novo-Ogaryovo residence . But the rising influence of China, with its proximity to Russia's sparsely populated eastern parts and nearly 10 times more people, has also given rise in Russia to worries China may one day challenge Moscow's influence on its own territory. Russia has created a separate ministry to channel resources to its far east, which complains of neglect and underfunding more than 20 years after the Soviet Union collapsed. Defence analysts say Russian efforts to allocate military resources, including air defences and nuclear submarines, to its eastern coast is an effort to counter China's rising military might - even as Russia sells weapons to its neighbour. Like their populations, their economies are uneven. China's gross domestic product grew 7.8 per cent last year, while Russia's growth was about 3.5 per cent and was close to stagnating in February, with 0.1 per cent year-on-year growth. Mr Xi and Mr Putin are expected to attend a summit next week of the BRICS group of emerging market economies, another vehicle for their efforts to counter Western clout, and the Chinese leader will visit African nations Beijing is courting.","Mr Putin tells BRICS nations to 'get more involved' in geopolitics .

When Kate steps out in a design it invariably sells out almost instantly. And now one enterprising fashion label has made the most of their association with the duchess - by reissuing a style she was seen in - and naming it The Kate. MaxMara have rereleased the beige belted style just weeks after the Duchess of Cambridge wore it on a public engagement. Unsurprisingly, it is already a sell out success. Kate wore the elegant coat with tights and brown heeled ankle boots when she visited Cambridge with her husband in November last year, and it immediately sold out . The Duchess - who is just weeks away from giving birth to her and Prince William's first child - wore the cashmere, knee-length overcoat on a visit to Cambridge last November, garnering a storm of publicity for the brand. Now, as a note of thanks, the label has reissued the coat and renamed it after her. The elegant piece, with a high neck . and a bow-shaped belt, is available from the Italian label's . diffusion line, MaxMara Studio . MaxMara Studio have decided to reissued the elegant coat under a new name, 'The Kate', and it has already sold out online at House of Fraser . The Kate coat costs £875 and is available to buy from House of Fraser in the UK. It has already sold out online. With myriad brands cashing in on Kate's selling power, many have suggested that the duchess could one day endorse her own clothing line. Indeed, last year . the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince . Harry applied to the Intellectual Property Office to trademark the duchess' royal title - so that one of her official charities could use . her name on a range of goods including 'clothing, footwear and . headgear'. The House of Fraser website shows that the coat has already sold out, despite its rather hefty price tag . A spokesman for St James's Palace said in March: 'We have been registering our new name and logo in different territories around the world. 'As part of that process, we have to choose any categories under which we might conceivably operate in the future. This also protects the foundation against other people using its name illegally. 'We included clothing in case we choose, for example, to make T-shirts in years to come, for marathon runners, etc.' The Duchess of Cambridge in her pale blue Beulah dress in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, left, which was reissued soon after she wore it . Eco-label Beulah reissued the £540 pale blue chiffon dress the Duchess of Cambridge sported on a visit Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur in September during a tour to the Far East. But Beulah aren't the only designers to reissue pieces in order to capitalise on the Kate effect. The Whistles blouse worn by Kate in her official engagement picture, left, and the blue 'Bella' dress by Whistles she wore at the Olympics Closing Ceremony, right, both quickly sold out after the Duchess was seen in them . Kate's cream silk Whistles blouse was relaunched after selling out when Kate wore it in her official engagement photo, taken by famed photographer Mario Testino.

Missoni also re-released a blue tweed coat, part of diffusion line M Missoni, that was snapped up two years after it first hit the catwalk by the thrifty Duchess at discount outlet Bicester Village. And it is not just Kate who can carry some serious fashion clout on the high street.

Eighteen beautiful fuzzy chicks hatched - in a significant moment that could save the Madagascar pochard from extinction. The species was believed to have been extinct until its rediscovery by chance on a single small lake in northern Madagascar, where just 22 of the cinnamon-coloured diving duck are left in the wild. Scroll down for video . Four of 18 ducklings bred from the world's rarest duck, the Madagascar pochard . Conservationists said the species remains extremely vulnerable to extinction from single events such as pollution or disease outbreak. An emergency expedition two years ago saw eggs taken from the wild and reared in captivity at a specially built centre in Antsohihy on the island off the coast of Africa. Ducks successfully hatched from the eggs taken into captivity have now themselves bred, producing 18 ducklings which are being reared at the centre. Dr Glyn Young, a conservation biologist with Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, one of the partners in the breeding programme, said: ‘The ducklings represent an incredible step forward in the fight to save the pochard from extinction. ‘Seven years ago, people thought this bird was already extinct and yet the discovery of one small population and now the arrival of these ducklings has led to real hope that the birds can one day flourish again.’ The Madagascar pochard was believed to have been extinct until its rediscovery by chance on a single small lake in northern Madagascar . Seven eggs bred from the world's rarest duck. Conservationists said the species remains extremely vulnerable to extinction from single events such as pollution or disease outbreak .

The conservation project, which also involves the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT), the Peregrine Fund, Asity Madagascar and the Madagascan government, is studying the wild population to understand why it is declining and where the best place to release a captive bred group would be. Scientists have raised concerns that the birds appear to have a very low breeding success rate at Lake Matsaborimena, their last remaining wild site. Peter Cranswick, head of species recovery at WWT, said: ‘Although Lake Matsaborimena is the last hiding place for the ducks, it is far from ideal as a habitat. ‘Our initial investigations suggest there is too little food and this may be leading to the low survival of the ducklings; in effect, they are starving to death.’ Mr Cranswick said the team had identified some lakes where the physical conditions were potentially right for the pochards. But as fishing is thought to be a factor in their decline and local communities depend on fishing, the success of a reintroduction scheme depends on gaining local support and finding a solution that benefits both locals and the birds.","Species thought to be extinct but found in pond in Madagascar .

Police last night demanded the resignation of Andrew Mitchell after a make-or-break meeting with officers from his local forces backfired. The attempt by the Tory Chief Whip to clear the air failed when he refused to say exactly how he abused officers in Downing Street. Police responded by saying that Mr Mitchell was accusing members of the diplomatic protection squad of lying. Under fire Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell visited a Tesco store in his Sutton Coldfield constituency today, before a showdown with police later over his 'plebgate' outburst at Downing Street officers . Mr Mitchell also opened The Holistic Practice in his constituency before meeting Police Federation leaders who say they want a full explanation or will demand his resignation . Ken Mackaill, of West Mercia Police . Federation, emerged from the meeting to say: ‘I think Mr Mitchell’s . position is untenable and if he won’t resign I don’t think Mr  Cameron . has any option but to sack him.’ Police protecting No 10 claim Mr . Mitchell called them ‘f****** plebs’ and told them they should ‘know . their place’ when they refused to let him through the main gates of . Downing Street on his bicycle. But apart from admitting to swearing he has flatly refused to reveal what he did say. Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell arrived for work by car yesterday and made his way into No10 by a side door . ‘He said he did not want to get into a . firefight with the police or impugn the integrity of police officers . but  unfortunately we’re left in the position where his continued denial . of facts recorded in police records does exactly that,’ Mr Mackaill . said. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called on David Cameron to sack Mr Mitchell . ‘I think Mr Mitchell has no option . but to resign. He’s continuing to refuse to elaborate on what happened. I . think his position is untenable.’ The Metropolitan Police officers who . were abused have accepted Mr Mitchell’s apology but Mr Mackaill said . officers in his force have a ‘massive issue’ with their colleagues’ truthfulness being questioned. The Chief Whip’s future is now . hanging by a thread after senior Tories continue to express the view he . is a ‘dead man walking’ because he has lost authority with Conservative . MPs. At least six members of the Cabinet . believe he will be unable to do his job effectively and he has become an . open object of ridicule among Tory MPs. The confrontation came as . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he thought Mr Mitchell should come . clean and warned that police throughout the country are angry with him. ‘I have no idea what he said. There seems to be competing claims about what was and wasn’t said,’ he said. ‘There is a dispute about words. He has got to explain himself to the Police Federation. 'There is a very strong feeling amongst all officers, not just in the Met.’ Mr Clegg said what Mr Mitchell did . ‘was very, very wrong’ and refused to say that he enjoys his confidence. He added: ‘It is bad enough to be rude to a police officer at the best . of times, but doing it at the time when those two police officers had . just been gunned down in Manchester made it all the worse.’ A friend of Mr Mitchell said he would not quit, insisting: ‘Andrew’s position hasn’t changed. He is carrying on with his work.’ A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘The . Prime Minister has said that what Andrew did was completely . unacceptable but he has apologised to the officers concerned and it is . time to draw a line under it.’ London Mayor Boris Johnson has said it would have been 'commonsensical' for police to arrest Mr Mitchell .

"By . Wil Longbottom . UPDATED: . 11:27 EST, 9 February 2012 . Greek political leaders have agreed a last minute deal on austerity measures to secure a bailout and keep the country afloat, it emerged today. Details of the agreement, which centred around €300million of pension cuts to ensure Greece met its 2012 fiscal targets, have not been released. But the decision comes just hours before finance minister Evangelos Venizelos met with eurozone colleagues in Brussels in a last ditch attempt to stave off bankruptcy. Broken down: Talks involving the three leaders of Greece's coalition government stalled after they failed to agree 300million euro in pension cuts, but they have now agreed a deal . Stumbling block: Greece must make further cuts to hit its fiscal targets for 2012 and be eligible for a 130billion euro second bail out . Mr Venizelos earlier today issued a dramatic plea to the coalition leaders to swiftly resolve their differences after all night talks in Athens stalled. He warned that Greece's 'survival over the coming years' depended on the €130billion second bailout and a related debt-relief agreement with private creditors. He said: 'It will determine whether the country remains in the eurozone or whether its place in Europe will be endangered. 'There is no room for any other expediency: we must look Greeks in the eye, look at the national interest and the interest of our children.' Precautions: Riot police guard the entrance to the Development Ministry in Athens after electricity company employees occupied it yesterday . Protest: Electricity workers wave banners from the Environment, Energy and Climate ministry in Athens yesterday. Two trade unions have announced a 48-hour strike starting on Friday . Debt inspectors from the EU, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund - known as the troika - held talks for five hours through the night with Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, Mr Venizelos and Labour Minister Giorgos Koutroumanis. But they failed to resolve the latest sticking point - a demand for substantial cuts in supplementary pensions - until a decision was reached this afternoon. One government official said: 'Yes, there is a deal.' Crisis talks: Greek finance minister Evangelos Venizelos has flown to Brussels to try and stave off bankruptcy . It is welcome news for the country after figures revealed a fifth of the workforce are unemployed and two labour unions announced a 48-hour strike for Friday over deeply unpopular austerity measures. Mr Venizelos will meet with finance ministers from the 16 other eurozone nations at 17:00 GMT. The issue that has threatened to derail the talks concerns cuts of around €300million that must be made so Greece can reach its fiscal targets for 2012. At stake is the €130billion bailout that will stave off bankruptcy. It was unclear whether Mr Papademos would meet with coalition backers - socialist George Papandreoum, conservative Antonis Samaras and George Karatzaferis, leader of the rightist LAOS party. Yesterday, the three leaders held talks for more than seven hours and backed a major austerity programme that includes a 22 per cent cut in the minimum wage, the sacking of civil servants and an end to dozens of job guarantee provisions. Athens has already accepted a demand to fire up to 15,000 workers in the public sector in 2012. The failure to agree a deal saw markets initially fall, but the FTSE rallied to rise up 0.32 per cent this afternoon at 5,894.85, while the Dow Jones fell 0.06 per cent. Sentiment: Right-wing newspaper 'Democracy' ran a picture of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with a swastika on her arm. Feeling against Ms Merkel has risen in Greece after she said the country may not remain solvent . Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the lack of progress highlighted the 'political theatre involved'. He said: 'The political leaders in Athens are campaigning. They need to be seen by the Greek population as fighting until the very last drop of blood... they are facing off against the Germans and IMF and the rest of the world.' A disorderly bankruptcy in Greece would likely lead to its exit from the euro - which in turn would damage other weak countries including Portugal, Ireland and Italy. But without help, Greece will not have enough money to pay off a big bond payment due on March 20, triggering a default that risks sending shockwaves throughout financial markets. Greece has been kept solvent since May 2010 by payments from a €110billion international rescue loan package. When it became clear the money would not be enough, a second bailout was decided last October. The country's unemployment rate rose to a new record of 20.9 per cent in November, up from 18.2 per cent the month before, ELSTAT figures revealed today. Two major labour unions, GSEE anmd ADEDY, will stage a two-day strike on Friday and Saturday in protest at the austerity measures. Ilias Iliopoulos, ADEDY's secretary general, said: 'The painful measures that create misery for youths, unemployed and pensioners do not leave us much room. 'We won't accept them. We are moving to a social uprising.'","Leaders of three parties behind Greek coalition finally agree on €300million pension cuts .

Four of Europe’s most cash-strapped countries are set to pull out of the Eurovision song contest - in case they win and have to host the lavish event the next year. Greece, Cyprus, Portugal and Poland have all said they are ‘very unlikely’ to take part in the cheesy singing contest that has become a European institution. The Greeks also said they could barely afford this year’s £100,000 fee to enter an act, and that ‘sequins and stage effects’ were distasteful at a time of austerity. No contest: The four countries said they are 'very unlikely' to enter the competition next year . Greeks protesting in October about the interference in their finances from Germany. Pulling out of the Eurovision would be another sign of the country's economic woes . An official at Greece’s state-owned . television network said: 'It’s not just that we don’t have the money to . pay to enter, at this point it would be morally wrong. 'And winning it would incur a huge expense for our country next year.' The cost of staging Eurovision is put at around £60million. Cyprus . state broadcaster PIK said entering the contest would be ‘provocative’ when it was imposing drastic belt-tightening measures on its population. Greece was represented by Eleftheria Eleftheriou this year but said they could barely afford the £100,000 fee to enter . Portugal and Poland also cited ‘financial reasons’ over the cost of entering and possibly having to host the event, due to take place in Swedish capital Malmo in May next year. Poland, which also pulled out last year, issued a statement saying: 'After a very careful analysis we made the difficult decision not to take part. The countries between them have garnered just one victory - Greece in 2005, when Helena Paparizou's 'My Number One' came out on top. Greece first entered the competition in 1974, while Cyprus joined the fray 7 years later. Of the four Portugal is the longest-running having entered every years since 1964. Poland is the relative newcomer, having seen its first entrant in 1994. The rush of nations pulling out comes after Spain’s entrant for the 2012 contest was urged to sing badly and not to win, to avoid any risk of having stage the competition in 2013. Bosses of Spanish public television told pop star Pastor Soler ‘to throw’ her entry amid massive government spending to reduce the huge national debt. The 33-year-old singer said directors of state-run broadcaster TVE called her in to say: 'Please don’t win. We don’t want to pay for it in 2013.' She added: 'I can understand why they asked. The money would be better spent paying ordinary people’s wages.' The Eurovision Song Contest - an annual competition organised by member countries of the European Broadcasting Union - has take place 57 times since it's debut in 1956, with Switzerland winning the inaugural tournament. There have actually been 60 winners after a four-way tie in 1969, with 26 different countries having won the contest.The UK has claimed victory four times. The most victories for a single country is seven by Ireland, with two of those - in 1980 and 1987 - performed by Johnny Logan, making him the only person to have won more than once as performer. Portugal is the country with the longest history in the contest without a . win - it made its forty-sixth appearance at the 2012 contest. No joy: Portugal is the country with the longest history in the contest without a win with entrants such as Sofia singing 'Foi Magia' in 2004 failing to make the grade . The voting techniques have evolved throughout the years but central to them has been the calling on of the points by a representative from each country. While Eurovision provides a unique opportunity for winning artists to capitalise on their success, relatively few have actually gone on to stardom. The most notable exception to this was Abba who won the 1974 contest for Sweden with their song Waterloo and went on to be one of the most successful bands of its time. Another notable winner who subsequently achieved international fame was Céline Dion, who won the 1988 contest for Switzerland with the song Ne partez pas sans moi.

The financial crisis has been as devastating for family incomes as a world war, a senior Bank of England official warned yesterday. It is likely that the costs will still be being paid by our grandchildren, Andrew Haldane added. He said there was ‘every reason’ for people to feel ‘deeply upset and angry’ about the turmoil inflicted by the crash of 2008 and 2009. Andrew Haldane's (left) statements come as George Osborne is prepared to unveil another round of cuts . In a sober analysis of the scale of . the challenge facing Britain Mr Haldane, the Bank’s executive director . for financial stability, said: ‘If we are fortunate, the cost of the . crisis will be paid for by our children. More likely it will still be . being paid for by our grandchildren. ‘In terms of the loss of incomes and outputs, this is as bad as a world war – that’s the scale we’re talking about.’ George Osborne will tomorrow . acknowledge in his autumn statement that bringing the public finances . back to order will take significantly longer than the Government had . anticipated. The Chancellor is expected to accept . that debt as a proportion of GDP will not be falling by 2015-2016, one . of his key fiscal targets. To meet his main commitment, to . eliminate the structural deficit, he is expected to have to find more . than £23billion through further cuts and tax rises by 2017. Key out-of-work benefits are expected to be frozen and the best-off can expect to lose some of their pension tax breaks. 'Devastating': Andrew Haldane said people had 'every reason' to feel 'deeply upset and angry' about the turmoil inflicted by the crash of 2008 and 2009 . The Chancellor is expected to unveil a . series of measures to stimulate economic growth, including . infrastructure projects backed by £40billion of state guarantees, help . for smaller businesses that want to export, and a postponement of the 3p . a litre rise in fuel duty to put more money in people’s pockets. Mr Haldane, making his world war . comparison, told Radio 4’s the World at One: ‘It would be astonishing if . people weren’t fed up on the street, asking big questions about where . finance has gone wrong. There is every reason why the general public . ought to be deeply upset by what has happened and angry.’ In 2008 the then Chancellor, Alistair . Darling, came under fire from allies of Gordon Brown for saying that the . economic times Britain was facing were ‘arguably the worst they’ve been . in 60 years’ and would be ‘more profound and long-lasting than people . thought’. His warning has proved only too . accurate, according to Mr Haldane, based on the fall in the country’s . economic output since the recession and in the aftermath of the Second . World War. Output has fallen rapidly since the . recession, with real GDP currently 3.1 per cent below its 2008 peak. By . comparison, it rebounded fairly sharply after the end of the war. Mr Haldane said the banking industry . reached a pivotal moment in June when the scandal about the fixing of . Libor, a key interest rate, broke after a series of other events such as . the misselling of payment protection insurance. He said: ‘It was partly that the . public mistrust of the culture of banking had built up to such a point . that banking itself said: ‘‘Look, this has gone wrong’’.’ Mr Haldane said he would be . ‘surprised’ if the gold-plated salaries and bonuses enjoyed by City . executives – which have been a source of huge public anger – did not . fall further.","Andrew Haldane: People 'had every reason' to feel 'deeply upset and angry'

A liver transplant patient was sewn up with an A4-sized piece of surgical equipment left inside him, after a series of medical blunders. Michael O'Sullivan, 49, received a new liver at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, but was sent home with a silicone mat still inside him. It was only discovered after Mr O'Sullivan complained of suffering from a lot of pain following surgery. Doctors performed a CT scan three weeks later and decided to operate after spotting something unusual. Mr O'Sullivan was shocked to be told they had discovered the equipment inside him following the operation. Surgeon and assistant performing operation (posed by models) He has now won £7,000 in compensation from the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The award comes after Addenbrooke’s was heavily criticised by health watchdog Monitor, which cited a series of so-called ‘never events’ - incidents that simply shouldn't happen - as one of its major failings. Personal injury lawyers Slater and Gordon said the ordeal had been 'incredibly stressful' for their London-based client and could have put his health at risk. Mr O'Sullivan had a lapromat - a fish-shaped piece of silicon . - inserted during surgery just before closure of the abdominal wall and . designed to prevent inadvertant puncture of the bowel. The lapromat acts as a . kind of protective shield and should be removed before surgery is . completed. Mr O'Sullivan was treated at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridgeshire (pictured) which has been criticised by the health watchdog Monitor . Paul Sankey, Principal Lawyer at Slater and Gordon, told Mail Online: 'The hospital's own investigation says that the cause of the incident was . the failure correctly to record that an item from the instrument set . was in use, not recognising that it had not been removed and failure . correctly to complete the count at the end of the procedure. 'The normal . rule is - count in, count out. The root cause was said to be the . breakdown of routine checking procedures. In other words this was not, . like most surgical mistakes, an error of judgment in the exercise of a . difficult skill but really basic carelessness. 'I deal with medical . negligence claims day in day out. In my experience mistakes quite as . blatant as this are extremely rare.' A fish-shaped lapromat, like the one pictured, was left inside Mr O'Sullivan . Rebecca Brown, from the same firm, added: 'When we go to hospital for surgery, we . rightly expect the highest standards of healthcare and professionalism. These standards were not upheld when Michael had his liver transplant at . Addenbrooke’s. 'The award of compensation is a relief for someone whose health could have been endangered by this carelessness. 'We hope that the resolution of this . case, as well of those of others who have brought actions against . Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, will serve to . protect patients in the future.' A spokesman for Addenbrooke’s said: 'We deeply regret this incident and have apologised to the patient.' Dr Dan Poulter said the new rules will increase patient confidence . Healthcare providers will be contractually obliged to admit when they have made medical blunders that put patients at risk, it has been announced. From April next year NHS organisations will be forced to be transparent about breaches of patient safety, Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said.The new rules will increase patient confidence, he said. Ensuring staff across the health service are truthful is 'crucial' to delivering the highest standards of care, he added. At present, the NHS is expected to be truthful about mistakes but there is no contractual obligation to stop cover-ups. 'Patients place great faith in the NHS organisations that treat them, and they in turn have a duty to be honest and open about every aspect of care they deliver,' Dr Poulter said. 'When mistakes are made, we want them acknowledged, patients informed and lessons to be learnt. 'The importance of an open culture cannot be underestimated. We expect that Robert Francis will make further recommendations on the duty of candour when the Mid Staffordshire Inquiry is published, and we are committed to taking whatever further action we think is needed as a result. 'But we cannot wait - creating this contractual duty of candour now ensures that NHS contracts for the next financial year will champion patients’ rights to basic honesty, as well as safe care.' Peter Walsh, chief executive of the charity, Action Against Medical Accidents or AvMA, said: 'This appears to be a cynical attempt by the Department of Health to sidestep overwhelming pressure from patients’ groups and others for a statutory duty of candour and pre-empt recommendations from the Mid Staffordshire Inquiry which are likely to recommend a statutory duty. 'No one should be taken in by this. We do not object to a standard clause in NHS trusts’ contracts, but what the Government is saying is that it does not see a duty of candour as one of the ‘essential standards of quality and safety’ which all health organisations need to satisfy in order to be registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC). 'It clearly should be, as this would give the CQC statutory power to insist upon and enforce it. It is simply wrong to relegate such a fundamental issue to a standard clause in NHS trusts’ contracts.'","Michael O'Sullivan, 49, had a CT scan three weeks after his liver transplant after he complained of pain .

The Lib Dem resigned earlier this week after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice over claims his ex-wife took speeding points for him. Kicking off the party's campaign for the Hampshire seat, Mr Farage said: 'Our number one issue is that this country faces a second massive migratory wave . 'We have nothing against people from Bulgaria and Romania, we wish then well, but we cannot think it's right this country has a total open door policy.' He also used the opportunity to describe the EU budget reduction negotiated by Prime Minister David Cameron as 'a rotten deal for Britain'. He said the pressure on housing, education and other services from immigration 'poses a major problem' for the country, especially if people from other countries claim benefits. Citizens from Romania and Bulgaria will have full movement rights across Europe from 2014. He also accused rival parties of ignoring the issue of immigration. 'I'm always confident when UKIP is on the ballot paper,' Mr Farage added. 'If we can rally our support like we have in the last three by-elections in Rotherham, in Middlesbrough and in Corby then this seat could become a four-way marginal.'

He described the EU budget reduction negotiated by Prime Minister David Cameron as 'a rotten deal for Britain' 'The whole tenor of the debate in this country has changed since then, it's now an in/out debate on Europe,' he said .

The third biggest National Lottery jackpot ever is up for grabs tonight with a truly life changing £141million prize. A single EuroMillions lottery ticketholder winning that amount could splash out immediately on a Learjet 85 to take them and seven friends anywhere they liked - in fact, they could buy a dozen, organiser Camelot has said. That person would become the 572nd richest in the country, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Living the high life: Anyone scooping tonight's £141m National Lottery jackpot could afford to lead a jet set lifestyle and have money to spare . They would also become the UK’s third biggest National Lottery jackpot winner to date. Top of the National Lottery Rich List are Colin and Chris Weir who banked a £161 million EuroMillions jackpot in July 2011. They are Europe’s biggest lottery winners. In second place are Gillian and Adrian Bayford, from Haverhill in Suffolk, who won more than £148 million in August last year. If piled high in £50 notes then the jackpot would reach 1,017ft into the sky - the same height as the tallest building in Western Europe, The Shard. All smiles: The couple said they struggled to fully appreciate the moment they realised they had won the jackpot as their young son had just woken-up and was crying but eventually the life-changing news sank in . Celebration: Adrian Bayford, 41, and wife Gillian, 40, were the sole winners of a £148.6 million jackpot .

Cheers: Colin Weir and Chris Weir, from Largs in Ayrshire, celebrate after they scooped £161 million in a EuroMillions draw . If laid end to end, the notes would take you 13,670 miles, from London to Hawaii and almost all the way back. The £141million jackpot would truly be a life-changing amount of money. But what exactly could someone who scooped the third biggest National Lottery prize ever buy with their new-found wealth? If no-one matches all five main numbers and two Lucky Star numbers to win the jackpot, then it will roll over to Tuesday’s draw. The . jackpot can grow to a maximum of 190 million euros - depending on the . exchange rate at the time this would be around £162 million. Any prize money which would have . boosted the jackpot above 190 million euros is passed down to the next . prize-winning level, boosting the prizes to those winners. A National Lottery spokesman said: . 'All of us would secretly love to jet off to somewhere hot at the drop . of a hat, and with this EuroMillions jackpot in the bank you could. 'We . have our fingers crossed that another UK ticketholder will win big and . we encourage all players to get their tickets early. 'EuroMillions, which is drawn every . Tuesday and Friday, helps to contribute to the £35 million generated for . National Lottery Good Causes each week.'

Lottery winners Matt Topham and Cassey Carrington, 22, celebrate after . winning £45,169,170.50 on EuroMillions jackpot in February this year . Once the jackpot has reached the 190 million euro cap, it can roll over only once before it must be won. If the jackpot is not won in the first EuroMillions draw when the cap is reached, it will stay at 190 million euros for the next draw. If there are no jackpot winners in that next draw, the whole jackpot amount - the 190 million euros plus any prize money that would have boosted the jackpot over this amount - is passed down to the next prize-winning level.

London Mayor Boris Johnson called for major changes to Britain's relationship with Brussels, which could then be put to a referendum . Dramatic cutbacks to the UK’s relationship with Europe are ‘essential’ Boris Johnson declared today, insisting a reworked deal with Brussels should be put to the British people in a referendum. The London Mayor warned David Cameron it is ‘high time’ voters had a say on the EU and called for a more ‘pared down’ and ‘common sense’ agreement with the EU. Mr Johnson called for a return to a simplified ‘single market’, with Britain no longer bound by the social chapter or EU-wide fisheries policy. In a major speech in London’s Docklands financial centre the senior Tory said Britain could be more like Norway or Switzerland, but remain inside the single market to ensure trading with the continent continues. Mr Cameron has called for a renegotiation of some powers, which would then be put to the country in a referendum. But Mr Johnson went further, ties with the EU be stripped back to the original vision of single market. He also defied the Prime Minister, who has backed Eurozone countries former a closer fiscal union, warning it was ‘anti-democratic and therefore intellectually and morally wrong’. The London Mayor demanded Mr Cameron ‘bring Britain’s membership in line with what people want’. ‘Boil it down to the single market. Scrap the social chapter. Scrap the fisheries policy,’ said Mr Johnson. ‘We could construct a relationship with the EU that more closely resembled that of Norway or Switzerland - except that we would be inside the single market council, and able to shape legislation... ‘That is a renegotiated Treaty we could and should put to the vote of the British people,’ he said at Thomson Reuters. ‘It is high time that we had a referendum, and it would be a very simple question. Do you want to stay in the EU single market - yes or no? And if people don’t think the new relationship is an improvement, then they will exercise their sovereign right to leave the EU. ‘This pared down relationship is essential and deliverable.’ Mr Johnson also took a swipe at Germany, claiming the government of Greece had been ‘taken over’ by Chancellor Angela Merkel. Mr Johnson accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel of 'taking over' the Greek government . He joked it was not ‘the outcome the Greeks were hoping for in 1944’, when the Nazi occupation of the country was ended. The euro had shown itself to be ‘a calamitous project’ and plans for fiscal and banking union would ‘make a bad situation worse’, said the Mayor. He said Britain ‘can no longer pretend that this country is at the heart of Europe’ but it should be ‘liberating’ for the UK to ‘seize the moment to ask the British people to define themselves and their future in Europe’. ‘The future for London is to be at the heart of the world economy, the centre of a series of interconnecting sets, trading freely with the EU, but with our eyes on the growth economies of the 21st century,’ Mr Johnson added.","London Mayor wants UK to withdraw from social chapter and fisheries policy but remain in single market .

As MailOnline revealed last week, the former Today co-anchor, 56, has other future projects in mind - fuelling speculation that her daytime programme will not return for a third season next year. Amid reports that she will join old friend and former 'Katie' executive producer Jeff Zucker at his network CNN, a source said today Katie's special correspondent deal with ABC news would preclude her from joining the cable network for the 'forseeable future' Interestingly, the source added: 'Jeff has been making progress at CNN and Katie is not the distraction that he's looking for. Out of a job? New reports allege that Katie Couric's talk show will not be renewed for a third season . 'Jeff and Katie are not attached at the hip, they each have their focus on their jobs at hand.' The pair worked together on the Today show and the source added: 'They're in no rush to be reunited. It took them six years to reunite on a project the last time and no-one should assume it will be any quicker this time.' Katie is still filming episodes of the first season of her show and will launch a second season in September with new executive producer Rachel Miskowiec on board. It was reported at the weekend that the buzz inside ABC is that Katie could leave the show after the second season and head to CNN to join Zucker. 'The show was oversold at syndication and hasn’t lived up to expectations,' one source told the New York Post. Lady who lunches: Katie attended the Women Taking The Lead luncheon by Marie Claire at Marea on Monday in New York . 'Now everyone at ABC is gossiping that Katie will end up at CNN with Jeff.' The blonde mother-of-two is a special correspondent with ABC news, which was a key component of her deal when she signed up for her syndicated show. And this would preclude her from moving to CNN for the 'forseeable future'. This element of the deal is longer than her talkshow deal, which was signed for two years only. Last week, a friend admitted it . was 'too early to tell' if Katie would be back for a third season as . 'there are so many different factors that make a third season discussion . premature.' Recognisable faces:  Katie, Ellie Monahan and Sarah Jessica Parker joined her at the event . The future of the her talkshow will be made in six months, according to the TV source, who added: ‘There have been issues with leadership and there has been a turnover in staff as we head into the second year. ‘It’s natural when people are going to lose their jobs that they try to complain, but there are a lot of sour grapes. ‘But the reality is that there was always going to be a second year and anyone who suggests otherwise is wrong.’ The friend added: ‘There is a lot that Katie wants to do in the future, . but at the moment she is concentrating on the talk show.’ Finding her audience: The transition from hard news woman to daytime 'queen', seen here with British pop band The Wanted, was a harder one than expected . Fox News reported an unidentified ABC source who claimed that Katie’s . eponymous talk show will be cancelled after this first season ends. The report cited sources who say that her show is an . 'unmitigated disaster' for a number of reasons, including her elitist . approach to guest selection, her revolving door of executive producers, . and her reported determination to make the light afternoon talk show a . hard-hitting news program, all of which is denied. When Katie moved to ABC following her stint as the first female solo . news anchor of a nightly news program at CBS, she was hailed as being . the inevitable replacement for Oprah Winfrey, the long-reigning queen of . daytime who had just stepped down from her show. Finding a mix: Couric has reportedly clashed with staff over her desire to skip typical daytime talkshow segments (like one on former child stars, seen here with a Full House alum in June) for more news coverage . She launched the show with longtime pal Jeff Zucker on board as her executive producer, he then left to head up CNN. Michael Morrison came on board in January and will now be replaced by . old hand Rachel Miskowiec, who previously served as executive producer . on The Tyra Banks Show, garnering two Daytime Emmy Awards for . Outstanding Informative Talk Show, the same category Katie landed its . first Emmy nomination in this year. The move comes a month after original Katie co-executive producer .

Paris Jackson is seen here speaking under oath - and claiming one of her former nannies - who was obsessed with her father - used to climb into bed with the King Of Pop. The 15-year-old schoolgirl made the accusations about ex-nanny Grace Rwaramba in a deposition she gave as part of the wrongful death suit against AEG. The video was recorded in March - before Paris' made a suicide attempt earlier this month - but was replayed on Tuesday during the trial. Scroll down for video... Under oath: Paris Jackson, seen in a pre-recorded video, giving a deposition as part of her late father Michael Jackson's wrongful death suit, where she claims her former nanny would jump into bed with the King Of Pop . Claims: Paris said Grace Rwaramba was 'obsessed' with her father . Paris claimed Rwaramba, who has visited the teenager in hospital since . her suicide attempt, was 'obsessed' with Jackson. She . said: 'My dad didn’t like her so he tried to keep her away from us. He . would send her to run errands a lot… He said she was sneaky, she was not . an honest person and she lied a lot.' Paris . added in the footage: 'She used to be [one of the nannies] but she got . really creepy. This is going to freak you out. One time, it was before - . me and my brother were really young - before Blanket was born. 'When he would stay in a hotel, or . whatever, she would call the hotel and say that she was his wife. She . was obsessed with him… They let her in and he’d wake up and she would be . in his bed.' Paris' video deposition was shown on Tuesday because the teenager is . still too unwell to testify in person. The videos were used after lawyers for the Jackson family told the judge that Paris, who is suing concert giant AEG along with her grandmother Katherine, 83, and siblings, would be unable to testify in person due to the fact that she is still recovering in hospital. Jackson's former personal chef Kai Chase also opened up about how Paris and her siblings have coped in the wake . of their father's death, while testifying in court on Tuesday. During a testimony in the Jackson family's . wrongful death suit against AEG Live regarding Michael's death, Chase . revealed the 15-year-old is 'devastated and lost'. Troubled: The deposition was played again in court on Tuesday as Paris was not able to attend in person as she is still recovering following her suicide bid earlier this month . She also revealed that Paris no longer wants parties for her birthday since her father hosted a private circus for her when she turned 11. Chase said: 'Being daddy's little girl, Paris is devastated. She's devastated and lost. She's trying to find herself and find who she is. It's . taking a lot of love and understanding to keep her together. She breaks . down, she cries, she talks about him.' Jackson's former personal chef Kai Chase testified in his wrongful death trial . Earlier in her testimony, she described an April 2009 birthday party . for Paris that included a private circus. The Cirque du Soleil-style . show featured men on stilts and a woman performing in a giant balloon, . Chase said. Paris Jackson, who was turning 11, adored her father and Chase helped . decorate a room filled with posters and photos of the Thriller . singer. The singer's music was played throughout the party. It was the last birthday party the 15-year-old has had. 'Paris hasn't . had any birthdays since,' Chase said. 'She hasn't wanted to celebrate . since'. And youngest son Blanket, who remains home-schooled, wears a T-shirt with his father's image every Friday, she said. Katherine's lawsuit claims AEG failed to properly investigate Dr. Conrad Murray, who is serving a four-year prison sentence for involuntary manslaughter over the 50-year-old star’s death, and pushed the superstar to rehearse and perform a planned series of 50 comeback shows titled This Is It. Lawyers acting for Paris, Prince Michael, their brother Blanket, 10, and Katherine contend that pressure from AEG led to Jackson’s death from an overdose of surgical anaesthetic in June 2009, two weeks before his This Is It concerts were to begin at the O2 Arena in London. 'Devastated and lost': Paris and Prince with their father in 2005. He died in 2009 . Both Paris and her brother Prince are listed as potential witnesses in the case, which is in its sixth week of trial. Marvin S. Putnam, a defense attorney . for AEG Live, said Paris and Prince Jackson were deposed in the case . because they are named plaintiffs. He said Paris' testimony was not a . 'grilling' but urged privacy for her and her family. 'There's . a real person involved here,' Putnam said. 'There's a 15-year-old girl . and something incredibly tragic has happened that none of us know why . and I think it would really be in everyone's best interest and . particularly in her best interest if rather than blowing this up into . something else, that they were given a little bit of privacy to deal . with something that has to be a tragic, tragic moment for all of them.' 'She's 15,' he said. 'Someone should give her a break.' According to TMZ, legal papers reveal . the famous offspring are asking for $10 billion for all of the future . earnings they claim their father would have generated if he had he . lived. Seeking . damages: Paris (centre) and her siblings Blanket (L) and Prince (R) are . asking for $10 billion for all of the future earnings they claim their . father would have generated if he had he lived . According to the website the family want an additional $50 million for various other damages. AEG, . which denies any liability for the star’s death, and says the huge figure . is based on speculation and that Jackson’s career was on a downward . spiral. Legal analysts say the billions being claimed are unlikely to be awarded and are a legal tactic to get publicity for the case. Just days prior to her suicide bid, Paris was reportedly told that she does not share the same biological father as Prince. Then, . over the days that followed, Paris spiralled into depression and was . admitted to the UCLA medical centre hospital after cutting her wrists . and taking an overdose of pills on June 5.

Urban Outfitters has stopped selling flasks, shot glasses and pint glasses that look like prescription pill bottles after a multi-state campaign against the products. Political leaders in drug-plagued Kentucky led the fight to get the retailer to pull the items, saying they trivialised the pain and suffering of people struggling with addiction. It comes as prescription drugs have grown to become the leading cause of accidental death in the U.S., with many youngsters experimenting with mistakenly believing that they're safer than street drugs. An Urban Outfitters branch in Greenwich Village, New York: The retailer has stopped selling flasks, shot glasses and pint glasses styled as prescription pill bottles after a multi-state campaign against the products . Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear said yesterday: 'I wrote a letter to the Urban Outfitters CEO shortly after learning about this abominable product line, and I'm very pleased that the store has changed course. 'There's nothing fashionable about prescription drug abuse, and selling teen-targeted items that glamorise prescription drugs is repulsive.' Urban Outfitters, which caters to teenagers and young adults, sent a statement to the Courier-Journal of Louisville saying it had stopped selling the items. The company did not respond to telephone calls and emails from The Associated Press yesterday. Anti-drug group The Partnership at Drugfree.org initiated the push to get the shops to stop selling the items. Political leaders and Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway signed on last month in Kentucky, where more people now die from drug overdoses than car crashes. Mr Conway joined 23 of his colleagues from across the country in calling on Urban Outfitters to pull the items, which he said 'make light of an epidemic that kills more than 1,000 Kentuckians each year and is responsible for more deaths than heroin and cocaine combined.' Mr Conway said prescription drugs are now the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, and he said too many teens are experimenting with them, believing that they're safer than street drugs. 'Urban Outfitters is doing the right thing by removing these tasteless products that make light of an epidemic that kills thousands of people each month in the United States,' said Mr Conway.","Kentucky politicians led fight against products they said trivialised addiction .

The Duchess of Cambridge's penchant for smart, feminine maternity wear has sparked a nationwide trend among Britain's other mothers-to-be, according to a new report today. Department store chain Debenhams has seen sales of sophisticated dresses and smart styles in their maternity collections increase by more than 500 per cent compared to this time last year, and is attributing this to pregnant women wanting to emulate the Duchess' well-documented elegant look. With not a pair of dungarees, leggings or a smock in sight, the Duchess of Cambridge has continued to paint a picture of elegance throughout her pregnancy. For her, maternity style has meant neatly tailored coats that skim her burgeoning bump, smart dresses with empire line or wrap styling and just a hint of a higher hemline to emphasise her still-slender legs. There was no hint of dowdy maternity wear as the Duchess watched the Trooping of the Colours last week in her last royal engagement before the birth, wearing a pale pink coat with pearl buttons and matching hat . Kate managed to combine high-fashion with comfort in the later stages of her pregnancy in a dalmatian print coat and black fascinator hat when she named The Royal Princess at Southampton last week . Kate has favoured chic tailored coats throughout her pregnancy to add class and comfort to her outfits . And Debenhams has reported that its customer is following suit. No more do pregnant young women want to shroud themselves in yards of fabric, nor do they want to forgo fashion for nine months. As a result, the store has seen an increase in sales of the very sort of clothes the duchess has been favouring. Clothing items proving popular include printed blouses in cool cottons and satins (sales up 36 per cent), smart coats and kimono-sleeve dresses (sales up 127 per cent). Debenhams spokeswoman Michelle Dowdall said: 'Details such as embellishment and soft fabrics are important to our customers, as they want to get the Kate look even whilst pregnant. 'Women seem to be shunning more stereotypical, casual types of maternity wear such as jersey trousers and leggings, and instead want to look and feel their best.' Dresses with a kimono style (right) and angel sleeves (left) have seen a huge increase in sales as pregnant women aim to emulate the Duchess's elegant maternity style . Kate's fun and fresh take on her style through her pregnancy has clearly inspired other expectant mothers to forgo the usual baggy elasticated look and embrace a more fashion conscious range of maternity wear . Women are also emulating Kate's . off-duty look, with pretty woven tops and cropped capri trousers selling . well, with some lines up more than 500 per cent. Due to the popularity of elegant maternity wear styles and shapes, Debenhams is dubbing the trend 'The Duchess Effect'. Ms Dowdall added: 'We have done a lot of work on our maternity ranges to ensure we are offering customers what they want. Clothes still need to be comfortable, but not necessarily baggy and made from 100 per cent elastic. 'Sales suggest that mums-to-be are waving goodbye to leggings and dungarees, and opting for timeless, stylish maternity wear.' Debenhams is planning to roll out more formal and occasion maternity styles to keep up with the trend, and cope with customer demand as the season moves into autumn.","Duchess of Cambridge's chic maternity style has influenced the high street .

Free choice: Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg has said people should be able to choose their own solicitor . A cabinet split over plans to cut legal aid deepened last night as Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg signalled his concerns for the first time. The Liberal Democrat leader said it was ‘perverse’ to stop people choosing their own solicitor and claimed small high street law firms would suffer – rather than the ‘fat cat QCs’ targeted by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling. Asked about the reforms by lawyer and Lib Dem activist Nick Thornsby in Manchester yesterday, Mr Clegg said: ‘You could say it’s perverse that a Government with Conservatives in it is reducing public choice rather than increasing it. ‘The only straitjacket on all of this is the need to yield about £220 million of savings in legal aid in criminal cases. ‘But on the back of the consultation we should see  if there are alternative, less disruptive, less unpopular ways of delivering that.’ The comments come after the Conservative Attorney-General came out on the side of lawyers who are angry at the changes. Dominic Grieve said he could do little about the plan – because ‘policy in this area is owned by the Lord Chancellor, and not me’. But he promised he would ‘endeavour to ensure, as far as I can, that the decision  he reaches in due course is  a fully informed one’. Mr Grayling’s plans threaten three-quarters of the UK’s 1,600 solicitors’ firms and could cost an estimated 10,000 jobs – as multi-million-pound contracts would be handed to firms offering the cheapest bid. The Tory split has deepened even further with attacks by influential Tory backbenchers Dominic Raab and David Davis. Pressing ahead: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling's plans could cost an estimated 10,000 jobs . Mr Davis said that under the changes many recent high-profile cases that the Government lost would never have been fought – including the Gurkhas and the Afghan interpreters who won the right to settle in Britain. Mr Grayling’s proposals mean the only way such cases could be taken up would be if the lawyers who were suing the Government worked for free. The reason is a proposed residence test – under which no one, British citizens included, can apply for civil legal aid unless they live in the UK.","Lib Dem leader said it is 'perverse' for people to not be able to choose their own solicitor .

NFL star: Eli Manning arrives for his appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman last night in New York after leading the Giants to Super Bowl victory . Super Bowl hero Eli Manning told the David Letterman show last night he was dedicating the Giants' championship to his team-mates. The two-time MVP made an appearance on the 'Late Show with David Letterman' just 24 hours after leading the New York Giants to a 21-17 victory over the New England Patriots for their second title in five years. He was given a standing ovation as he emerged into the Ed Sullivan Theater to the sound of Queen's 'We Are The Champions'. The quarterback had been in Disney World Florida for a victory parade only four hours before the interview as his team-mates landed triumphantly at Newark airport in the afternoon. Manning told Letterman: 'When you win a championship, it's a team. It's a team coming together, and that's exactly what we did, and so I was happy for a lot of the guys. 'This is their first Super Bowl, so I think when you have one, that second one, you really do it for the other guys who've never had that experience. 'The first one just is wild.' Big Blue's narrow win over the Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI is their second over the same opponents in the last five years. Eli Manning now has two Super Bowl MVP awards to go with this winner's rings - one more than his brother Peyton, quarterback of the Indianapolis Colts. But the quarterback was coy on whether his older brother would return to action in the NFL next season. Peyton Manning missed this entire season with a neck injury. He said: 'He got a good report from his doctor, said ""hey, you know, if you were my own son, I'd give you the ok to play"", and so he'll be ready.

They're the two biggest stars of women’s tennis with their talent matched only by their mutual dislike of one another. And yesterday the froidure between Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova showed no sign of thawing. The intense rivalry is made all the more complex off court by the two women’s deeply intertwined personal lives. Maria Sharapova (left) has hit back at rival Serena Williams (right) who called her 'boring' Sharapova was scathing about Williams' relationship with tennis coach Patrick Mouratoglou (pictured) In a prickly press conference ahead of this week’s Wimbledon Championships, Miss Sharapova, 26, fired the opening salvo of the fortnight. She berated World No 1 Miss Williams for comments made in an interview in America about her being ‘boring’. Miss Sharapova – who is dating Serena’s ex-boyfriend Grigor Dimitrov – was also scathing about Serena’s relationship with married tennis coach Patrick Mouratoglou. Miss Williams, 31, had said of her fierce rival: ‘There are people who live, breath and dress tennis. I mean, seriously, give it a rest. Williams previously said that Sharapova's tennis star boyfriend Grigor Dimitrov had a 'black heart' Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams, pictured at the pre-Wimbledon party, have a competitive relationship both on and off the court . ‘She begins every interview with, “I’m so happy. I’m so lucky.” It’s so boring. She’s still not going to be invited to the cool parties. And hey, if she wants to be with the guy with a black heart [Dimitrov], go for it.’ Yesterday the Russian-born, World No 3 ace, hit back, saying: ‘If Serena wants to talk about something personal, she should talk about her relationship and her boyfriend who was married, who is getting a divorce and who has kids – and not draw attention to other things.’ Miss Sharapova and Miss Williams, 31, have had a notoriously competitive relationship on the court, fuelled by the fact Miss Sharapova hasn’t beaten her rival in nine years. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- . The state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland is under fire for lavishing hundreds of thousands of pounds on corporate hospitality at Wimbledon. Staff and guests of the bank, bailed out with billions of pounds of taxpayers’ cash, will enjoy the run of plush ‘Suite H’ overlooking the famous No 1 Court throughout the tournament. They will be able to watch the top matches from the best seats at the All England Club’s show courts, and dine on gourmet food such as lobster, gammon and Gressingham duck. RBS staff and guests will dine on gourmet food such as £50 pork and sage pies . A free bar will serve champagne cocktails, and other delicacies will include Vale of Evesham asparagus, slices of a £50 pork and sage pie with pickle and tasty British cheeses. Other companies using the tournament to entertain clients include the BBC, oil giant BP and Barclays Bank. RBS, which was taken to the brink of collapse by former boss Fred Goodwin, was saved by a Treasury bailout in 2008. The Government now has an 81 per cent shareholding. The bank axed 15,000 jobs and pledged to cut corporate hospitality, but continues to sponsor Britain’s No 1 tennis player, Andy Murray. It is thought that RBS is paying about £260,000 for its suite at Wimbledon. News of its extravagance was met with disbelief last night.Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It is outrageous that hard-pressed families are still paying the  price for propping up the banks yet RBS can afford to wine and dine clients.’ An RBS spokesman said that as well as entertaining, the bank used Wimbledon to promote an initiative to help foster children’s sport. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- . It has become the year’s hottest  sporting event, graced by the stars of stage, screen and society. And this year’s Wimbledon will  play host to Britain’s newest breed of celebrity – our Olympians. The All England Club has sent  invitations to all our gold medal winners as a belated thank you for their record-breaking haul last August. Olympic heroes such as Mo Farah and Chris Hoy are believed to have accepted invitations to the Royal Box . Among those set to sit in the Royal Box this week are double-gold medallist Mo Farah, and cycling champions Laura Trott and Sir Chris Hoy. However, some athletes are unable to attend because the Wimbledon  fortnight falls in the middle of their busiest training period. Tour de France competitors Sir Bradley Wiggins, Mark Cavendish and Chris Froome have all had to decline their invitations, as has heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis. Among the other names believed  to be putting in an appearance are  Sir Alex Ferguson, US Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, Pippa Middleton and Sir Mervyn King, who will retire as Governor of the Bank of  England on June 30. Although Philip Brook, chairman of the All England Club, is notoriously tight-lipped about who receives an invitation into the Royal Box, insiders point out that more celebrities are being offered seats instead of minor royals, diplomats and aristocrats. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- .

Andy Murray, pictured during practice, drunk champagne after winning the U.S. Open . Teetotal Andy Murray quaffed champagne after his first ever Grand Slam win and was so hung-over he mistakenly used shaving cream to brush his teeth the next morning, his girlfriend reveals in a BBC documentary to be screened tonight. Teasing the super-fit star about being a ‘lightweight’, Kim Sears says that Andy couldn’t resist a celebratory drink to toast his success in the US Open last year and he laughingly admits in the show: ‘I had a few glasses of champagne, then when I went to brush my teeth I ended up using shaving cream instead of toothpaste.’ Andy Murray’s bid for Wimbledon glory is in danger of being blighted by injury. His 79-year-old grandmother – and No1 fan – has broken her hip and may be unable to take her seat on Centre Court to cheer him on. Murray revealed that Shirley Erskine was recovering from surgery after being taken to hospital following a fall at her home in Dunblane. ‘She was doing the bed and tripped on the electric blanket,’ he said. ‘I called and asked, why in this day and age, she was still using an electric blanket and she said, “It’s not me, it’s your grandfather!” ’ Andy Murray, pictured with coach Ivan Lendl, said his grandmother is in hospital after breaking her hip . Ann Jones – a three-times Grand Slam singles winner – says that it is only her fellow Britons who are upset by the grunting and screaming of modern female players. ‘It drives a lot of English people, including my friends, mad,’ said the 74-year-old, who played to the sound of nothing more that polite applause in the 1960s. ‘But as far as I can tell we’re the only country where anyone objects, the rest of the world don’t seem to care. ‘It’s not very ladylike but do I expect ladies to be ladylike when they play tennis? I expect them to be athletic.’ Wimbledon fans will be served up a vintage strawberry crop this year – thanks to the record-breaking cold spring. Staff at the All England Club expect to sell two million of the plumpest and sweetest berries for 30 years as a result of the unseasonal chill at the start of the growing season. It meant the plants remained in the ground longer than normal before flowering. Marion Regan at Hugh Lowe Farms in Mereworth, Kent, will deliver 33 tons of the traditional summer fruit during Wimbledon, where the punnets of ten berries will sell for £2.50.","The two have an intense rivalry both on and off the court .

A massive wildfire threatening a tourist region in southwestern Colorado has grown to nearly 60 square miles, but officials said Saturday that the erratic blaze had slowed and they were optimistic they could protect the town of South Fork. The fire's rapid advance prompted more than 400 evacuations Friday, and it could be days before people are allowed back into their homes, cabins and RV parks, fire crew spokeswoman Laura McConnell said. South Fork Mayor Kenneth Brooke estimated that up to 1,500 of the town's permanent residents and summer visitors were evacuated.

Smoke-logged: Smoke from the West Fork Fire surrounds drivers on Colorado 149 near South Fork, Colorado, which was closed . Some business owners were being allowed back into South Fork to prepare for the lifting of the evacuations. Officials, meanwhile, closely monitored an arm of the blaze moving toward the neighboring town of Creede. 'We were very, very lucky,' said Rio Grande County Commissioner Carla Shriver. 'We got a free pass yesterday.' McConnell said no structures had been lost and the fire was still about 5 miles from the town. The blaze had been fueled by dry, hot, windy weather and a stand of dead trees, killed by a beetle infestation. But the fire's spread had slowed by Saturday morning after the flames hit a healthy section of forest. Fire crews remained alert as more hot, dry and windy weather was forecast. The wildfire, a complex of three blazes, remains a danger, officials said. 'The fire is very unpredictable,' Shriver told evacuees at Del Norte High School, east of the fire. 'They are saying they haven't quite seen one like this in years. There is so much fuel up there.' Smoke permeated the air Saturday in Del Norte, where a Red Cross shelter was set up for evacuees.

Bob and Sherry Mason bought the Wolf Creek Ski Lodge on the Western Edge of South Fork about a year and a half ago. 'This (wildfire) was in our contingency plan being Colorado, but we didn't expect it this soon,' Sherry Mason said. New fire crews, meanwhile, descended from other areas to join more than 32 fire engines stationed around South Fork, with hoses and tankers at the ready. Firefighters also worked to move potential fuel, such as lawn furniture, propane tanks and wood piles, away from homes and buildings. The town of Creede's 300 residents were under voluntary evacuation orders as officials feared the fire could reach the roads leading out of town. The heavy black smoke, broken up only by an orange glow over the outlines of the San Juan mountains, had lightened Saturday morning.

It had been so thick that the shade from the smoke plume helped keep an 18-square-mile wildfire burning 100 miles to the east near Walsenburg from spreading as fast as it would have otherwise. Susan Valente, an on-site spokeswoman for the fire near Walsenburg, said the shade helped keep the forest from drying out in the hot afternoon sun. Residents from 300 homes remain evacuated while in the city of Walsenburg and the town of Aguilar remain on pre-evacuation notice, meaning residents must be ready to flee at a moment's notice. 'Fire conditions are prime with the combination of fuels, heat, winds and low humidity,' fire information officer Mike Stearly of the Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center said. 'It's expected to be like this through next Tuesday.'

A high-flying banker has claimed she was bullied, tormented and called ‘crazy Miss Cokehead’ by male colleagues after she blew the whistle on insider dealing. Cambridge graduate Svetlana Lokhova, who earned more than £750,000 a year,  is suing her firm over what she called a ‘sustained and vicious’ campaign of abuse and sexual harassment. Colleagues at the investment bank allegedly referred to her as ‘mad Svetlana’ and told her to visit Nigeria for sex with tribesmen to ‘calm her down’. High-flyer: Svetlana Lokhova is suing her firm after claiming she was bullied and tormented by male colleagues . Miss Lokhova, 32, said the harassment was part of a smear offensive as punishment for reporting insider dealing by a senior trader, who was later dismissed. On the day she resigned, one male colleague said she needed to relax and should visit Nigeria ‘to be s****** by one or more big black men because they would calm her down’. Senior analyst Mikhail Stiskin wrote in an email to a co-worker of how he ‘knew a few tribe leaders in Nigeria . . . proper alpha male . . . she needs to relax after the stressful period of the past months. These guys would help’. Her barrister, Andrew Stafford QC, said the comments showed a ‘demeaning and offensive attitude towards women in general and to Miss Lokhova in particular’. The Russian-born daughter of a ship broker first quit her job as head of fixed income sales in February 2010 after being told by bosses that her complaint of insider trading was ‘unacceptable’. However, two months later she was head-hunted by company bosses in Moscow and returned to the bank’s London-based subsidiary, Troika Dialog UK, with a guaranteed annual bonus of £666,000 on top of her £120,000 salary. Miss Lokhova, who began working at the bank in 2008, claims that on her return line manager David Longmuir and chief executive officer Paolo Zaniboni victimised her because of the whistleblowing and conspired to get rid of her. Six months later, her name was on a ‘firing list’ for poor performance and she started a grievance process against the bank. She was signed off sick with stress before finally resigning in April last year. Miss Lokhova claims boss Paolo Zaniboni victimised her because she blew the whistle on insider dealing, which he denies . In a witness statement, Miss Lokhova, who was the only woman in her team, said she was referred to in emails by derogatory names, including ‘crazy’,  ‘mental’ and ‘totally unstable’. Others included ‘quite likely clinically bonkers’ and ‘MAJOR car crash’. She said: ‘My job was made impossible. This persistent unlawful treatment has had a seriously detrimental effect on my health, with severe and long-term consequences.’ She was also described as a cocaine user, which Mr Longmuir now accepts was both untrue and defamatory. Mr Stafford added: ‘This showed a willingness and intent to damage, by unlawful means, Miss Lokhova’s personal reputation and professional standing.’ The Central London Employment Tribunal was also told that prior to her first resignation, she had generated more than £20million in profit for the bank and was awarded a £600,000 cash bonus – the highest bonus paid globally to a sales person that year. Miss Lokhova also claims that whilst she was signed off work with stress, Mr Zaniboni ‘mobilised a very intrusive level of security investigation’ into her private life. She alleged that she was followed in the street near her home in Canary Wharf, east London, and had her conversations eavesdropped on. When another Russian banker was gunned down outside his home at around the same time, Miss Lokhova became so fearful that she went to the police. Naomi Ellenbogen QC, defending, insisted Miss Lokhova was not victimised because she was a whistleblower and said her client denied that Miss Lokhova ‘sustained any detriment’. Instead, she argued, Miss Lokhova’s ‘rude and dismissive attitude towards colleagues, her unprofessional behaviour and her tendency to lose her temper and self-control when things did not go her way’ were to blame. Spokesman Paul Marriott said Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender and owner of Troika Dialog UK, is ‘confident that it has acted appropriately and lawfully and will vigorously defend itself against the allegations made’. Damages awarded by the tribunal are normally capped at £70,000 but are unlimited in discrimination and whistleblower claims. The hearing continues.","Svetlana Lokhova is suing over claims of abuse and sexual harassment .

But Grossinger's dancing days are over, the last guests have long since checked out, and the resort has been left to rot for 27 years. The 1,200-acre Catskills resort was abandoned in 1986 - the year before the hit film, starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey as a dance instructor and Baby Houseman, a holidaying teenager at the fictional Kellerman's, was released. The hotel and grounds were part of the Borscht Belt, an area of New York state that was popular with holidaying Jewish families who faced discrimination elsewhere before cheap air travel meant trips abroad took off. The likes of Elizabeth Taylor and Jackie Robinson stayed at the glamorous resort in its 1960s and 70s heyday. Now Grossinger's has descended into decay, with deckchairs, beds and salon hairdryers still standing. A deckchair in the abandoned Jennie G hotel is now surrounded by foliage and moss, having been left untouched since 1986 . Two fold-down beds and a framed painting remain in this guest room even though moss has taken over the floor and the ceiling is bare . A beauty salon lies derelict with the tall hairdryer still standing. It looks like the salon was inspired by Dutch artist Piet Mondrian's Composition paintings from the wall tiles that remain . The deserted lobby has since been used for graffiti while the walls have been left to rot . The hotel began as a small guesthouse with no plumbing or electricity in the 1900s, reports AbandonedNYC.com. Austrian immigrants Asher Selig Grossinger and wife Malke moved to the Catskills from New York City, and Malke's incredible kosher cooking and their renowned hospitality meant they soon needed to expand. In 1919, they bought a bigger house - Grossinger's Terrace Hill House - sat within 100 acres. The Grossingers' daughter Jennie was the resort's hostess and by the time of her death in 1972, she had transformed it into 35 buildings attracting 150,000 guests a year. Grossinger's was famed for being the first place to use artificial snow for skiers in 1952. It had its own airstrip, ballrooms, auditoriums and sports grounds, hosting comedians and sporting champions and putting on nightly entertainment. Its golf course remains open next to the abandoned site. Hotels International bought the resort in 1985 but could not reverse its fortunes when it came to declining visitor numbers who had given up the 100-mile journey to the Catskills from New York City in favor of air travel. Now, the moss-covered walls and floors have become spots for graffiti and exploration as the overgrown shell of Grossinger's remains. A summer at Grossinger's, a family destination popular with Jewish holidaymakers, was believed to have inspired Dirty Dancing.

The National Transitional Council of Libya has chosen an electronics engineer as its new interim president as the country seeks to re-wire itself for the post-Gaddafi era. Abdel-Rahim al-Keeb, from Tripoli, was elected last night by 26 votes cast by 51 members of the NTC and he will appoint a new Cabinet in coming days. Speaking about his election, Mr al-Keeb . said: 'This transition period has its own challenges. One thing we will . be doing is working very closely with the NTC and listening to the . Libyan people.' 'We salute and remember the revolutionaries who we will never forget. We will not forget their families,' he said. 'I say to them that the NTC did not and will not forget them and also the coming government will do the same.' Mr Al-Keeb did not set out any specific . plans for Libya during the coming months, but said that worries over . foreign oil contracts are unfounded. 'We understand that we had 42 years . with a brutal dictator... concerns are in order. But there should be . none of them,' he said. 'We demand respect for our national rights.' Big vote: NTC chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil (left) makes his choice in the ballot that saw al-Keeb elected . Heads of state: Prime Minister al-Keeb (left) shakes hands with National Transitional Council Chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil at the vote . The prime minister said he expected to choose his cabinet ministers within two weeks. 'We said we would (elect a cabinet) a month from the liberation. We have two weeks left and we intend to meet that deadline.' The new government is to run Libya in the coming months and to pave the way for general elections. Al-Keeb is considered to be a good choice for the transitional government as he is a consensus candidate. Although his religion is listed as Sunni Islam, academia has dominated his life and he is not thought of as a radical. He also has no links with the Gaddafi regime and has spoken out against the dictator in the past. As he is from Tripoli in the west of the country, his appointment balances the influence at the top of government as the president is from the east of Libya. He graduated from the University of Tripoli before going to the U.S. in 1975 to continue studying. He became a professor at the University of Alabama in 1985 and has worked at the University in Sharjah, Dubai, and the Petroleum Institute in Abu Dhabi. The . NTC wants to form a new interim government after the fall of Moammar . Gaddafi because its initial members started out as an impromptu group. Jalal el-Gallal, an NTC spokesman, says Mr al-Keeb received 26 votes in the election. One . of his first duties will be to try and ensure peaceful stability in the . country with the U.N. Security Council urging Libyan authorities to . prevent thousands of Gaddafi's heavy weapons falling into the hands of . terrorists following the country's eight-month conflict. The Russian-drafted resolution . adopted unanimously by the council also called on the Libyan government . to destroy chemical weapons stockpiles in coordination with . international authorities. Ian . Martin, the top UN envoy to Libya, told the council last Wednesday . that Libya under Gaddafi had accumulated the largest known stockpile of . shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles in any non-producing country. While . thousands were destroyed during NATO operations, he said the UN is . increasingly concerned 'over the looting and likely proliferation' of . these weapons and other munitions, as well as a spate of newly-laid . mines within the country. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Andrew Shapiro said earlier this month that Libya was believed to have about 20,000 shoulder-fired missiles in its arsenals before civil war began in March. He said terrorist groups have expressed interest in obtaining some of the missiles, which 'could pose a threat to civil aviation'. Stockpiles: The late dictator had amassed a collection of shoulder-fired weapons that rivalled any other non-producing country . The resolution adopted on Monday . calls on Libyan authorities 'to take all necessary steps to prevent the . proliferation of all arms and related material of all types, in . particular man-portable surface-to-air missiles, to ensure their proper . custody.' It calls on countries in the region 'to consider appropriate measures to prevent the proliferation' of these weapons. The Security Council imposed an arms embargo against the Gaddafi government soon after the uprising began and it remains in place. It reminded all countries yesterday  that they are barred from purchasing or procuring weapons from Libya and from using their aircraft or ships to transport Libyan weapons. Russia's deputy UN ambassador Alexander Pankin said the main aim of the resolution is to prevent 'a breach of the arms embargo'. The risk of shoulder-fired missiles and other weapons 'falling into the hands of terrorist groups... is very high,' he said, and there is also a risk to civil aviation flights. 'The Libyan authorities bear the brunt of the burden for this, but the problems require constructive cooperation with Libya's neighboring states and the whole of the international community,' said Mr Pankin. The Security Council resolution expressed concern at the proliferation of weapons in the region 'and its potential impact on regional and international peace and security'. The U.S. has contributed about $40million toward finding and destroying the surface-to-air missiles and sent weapons experts to the country. It co-sponsored the resolution along with France, Britain, Nigeria and Portugal.","Abdel Rahim al-Keeb is an academic whose religion is is Sunni Islam .

A man who has had 54 cycles of chemotherapy for an inoperable brain tumour has defied doctors by naturally fathering a miracle baby girl. Ben Lindon, 34, was told the chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment to save his life would leave him infertile. But two years ago Ben met fiancée Kate McCreanor, 30, and, against all the odds, the couple are now proud parents to Martha, nine months. Miracle: Ben Lindon, 34, was told the chemotherapy to treat his inoperable brain tumour would leave him infertile but he defied doctors by fathering Martha, aged nine months, by wife Kate . Joy: Ben, Kate and Martha relax together, left, while the proud father takes his daughter on a trip to the beach . Ben, who doctors believe is the youngest person in the UK to have had so many rounds of chemotherapy, said: ‘Having such a beautiful baby daughter is just a dream come true. ‘When Kate told me she was pregnant I thought she must be mistaken. And when Martha was born it was the happiest day of my life. Now I am just overjoyed and loving every moment of being a dad.’ Ben’s nightmare began on March 2008 just before his 29th birthday. The former journalist was out running when his left arm suddenly went numb. ‘I obviously collapsed and blacked out because the next thing I remember is being picked up off the road and rushed to hospital.’ There, doctors told Ben he’d suffered a seizure, but that as he was fit, it was probably due to low blood sugar. However, further scans and tests revealed the worse news possible when he was diagnosed with a Grade 2 glioblastoma multiforme brain tumour. Adorable: Martha stares longingly into the eyes of her father, who was struck down with his illness aged just 29 . Daddy's girl: Martha's birth was a miracle as doctors told Ben he would never have a child, which left him devastated and fearful he would never find love . A type of brain cancer, it affects two to three people per 100,000 in the United States and Europe. Doctors don’t know what causes it - but because the tumour was so close to the central part of Ben’s brain, operating on it carried such a high risk of death that surgery was impossible. ‘It was a terrible shock,’ he recalled, ‘especially when doctors said they couldn’t even operate. My only hope of survival, of stopping it growing more or spreading, was to have urgent radiotherapy and chemotherapy. A side effect of the treatment was that it would leave me infertile – but doctors said there wasn’t time to freeze sperm. ‘Meanwhile I would need to take anti-seizure drugs to prevent fits for the rest of my life.’ After the first bouts of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, Ben felt so upset about not being able to have children, he visited a fertility specialist and had a sample of sperm frozen. But by then he believed having already had so much treatment, it was too late. He admits he felt his life was over. ‘One day I’d been a fit young man who lived day to day to being someone who suddenly had no idea what the future would hold. ‘My future seemed bleak. Being told because of the treatment, I could never father a child was terrible – at my lowest point, I worried would any woman want me?’ However, within months he had decided to use the experience to reappraise his life. ‘I began running more to get myself into really good physical shape,’ he says, ‘at the same time I decided to give up my desk job as a journalist and retrain as a tree surgeon. Grueling: Ben prepares for another bout of chemotherapy. He has 54 treatments and is thought to be the youngest person in Britain to have had so many . ‘Being out in the fresh air was incredibly therapeutic.’ Then in April 2011 at a party he was introduced to Kate. She recalls: ‘Ben was a friend of a friend and I knew he’d been unwell but that was all. However as soon as we started chatting, we hit it off. Over the next few days the pair rang and spoke on Facebook.  A few days later they met up again and within weeks they were a couple. Painful: Ben had a biopsy in order to diagnose his tumour, which left him with an enormous scar . ‘I knew very early on I’d met my soulmate,’ says Kate, ‘and when about a month into our relationship Ben explained to me about his brain tumour and that he couldn’t have kids, it didn’t bother me.’ Ben said: ‘I was really worried what Kate would think so I was incredibly relieved when she said it made no difference to our relationship.’ Three months later Ben moved in with Kate in Malvern, Worcestershire. But within five months she suspected she was pregnant. ‘For other health reasons I was also on the pill so at first it seemed a ridiculous thought,’ she says, ‘but I got a pregnancy test to check. I was stunned when it was positive.’ Ben was equally shocked – and then thrilled. However, the couple’s initial joy was shortlived when at five weeks, Kate started to bleed. ‘Doctors said it could be a miscarriage and I went for a scan,’ she says, ‘but it was too early to be able to see properly so I had to come back for another scan ten days later. ‘It was the most agonising wait for both of us so when we finally saw that little heartbeat on the screen, we were incredibly relieved.’ The couple were then worried all the drugs Ben has taken – including the maximum dose of radiotherapy and over 54 rounds of chemotherapy – might have affected his sperm and the baby in some way. Kate said: ‘The chemo is very strong and often Ben feels sick and tired taking it.’ However, following their threatened miscarriage, Kate’s pregnancy was straightforward and in September last year (2012), she gave birth to Martha who weighed a healthy 6Ib 15oz. The couple are now set to wed. ‘I proposed to Kate on a beach in Cornwall earlier this year and luckily she said yes,’ says Ben. He admits being diagnosed with a brain tumour has changed his outlook on life. ‘It’s taught me not to take anything for granted and I truly do appreciate every day.’ Little miracle: Kate had a miscarriage scare before Martha was born weighing 6lbs 15oz . But he’s determined to see Martha grow up: ‘Brain tumours are unpredictable. While some people live a normal life with a brain tumour for very many years, no-one knows what the future holds. ‘But having Martha has given me another reason to keep well and stay alive. And actually, despite everything, I feel lucky. I have a very fulfilling life, a wonderful fiance and amazingly, I’m a proud dad with a gorgeous little girl.’ Since being diagnosed with a brain tumour, Ben has competed in the Brighton Marathon, clocking up a time of 41/2 hours. He is now raising money for the charity, Brain Tumour Research, by competing in the Three Peaks Challenge – tackling the highest mountains in England Scotland and Wales over September 27-29. To .

A man who gave alcohol to his 12-year-old step-son - and six other minors - before the boy drowned in a Missouri river last year is scheduled to be sentenced today after pleading guilty last month to seven counts of second-degree child endangerment. Combs guilty plea was not part of any plea deal, according to prosecutors . Prosecutors in the case had initially hoped to charge Todd Combs with manslaughter in the death of 12-year-old Christopher Marks, but toxicology results from the boy's autopsy showed signs of ethanol that was produced during the decomposition process, so investigators were unable to determine how much alcohol Marks had consumed before he drowned. Facing the music: Todd Combs will be sentenced today after pleading guilty to charges that he gave alcohol to his 12-year-old step-son before the boy drowned in a Missouri river . 'It's disappointing that we can't determine the full extent of what . occurred,' prosecutor Bob McCulloch said at a press conference last year. 'The death of this child was clearly caused . by (Combs') criminal conduct. Circumstances like this would warrant more . serious charges, but we can only charge what we can prove.' On August 5, 2012, Combs and Marks attended a family picnic near the Meramec River in St. Louis County, Missouri, with at least six other minors, each of whom was 15 at the time. Before the picnic, Combs filled a cooler with dozens of beers and other alcohol and provided it to the minors. Child endangerment: Christopher Marks' body was pulled from the Meramec River miles from where he was last seen swinging from a tree swing . When the booze ran out, Combs even went to the store to refill the cooler. Marks was last seen about 7:30 p.m. swinging on a rope swing near the river. Once it was determined that Marks was missing, rescuers began a massive search for the boy. It wasn't until several days later, when Combs and a friend were searching for the boy on jet skis, that his body was recovered several miles from where he was last seen. According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Combs and the boy's mother have since separated. 'My life's forever changed,' she said. 'I will never be who I was. I will never have normalcy in my life.'

Police were called to the Asia Missionary Baptist Church in Lexington, Mississippi mid-day Sunday after a congregation meeting turned violent. They were already at the church when 26-year-old Cacedrick White showed up, armed. Shot: 26-year-old Cacedrick White was shot and killed when he showed up to his church armed with a shot gun . Riled up: White's father was a deacon at the Asia Missionary Baptist Church, and was in the church when the congregation got in a fight about whether or not to retain their current pastor . The atmosphere at a congregant meeting had turned violent when deacons tried to fire the pastor. The pastor was trying to hold a vote on whether to retain him. 'What happened was a bunch of the pastor's family showed up and there was a whole bunch of yelling and hollering,' Warren Strain, Bureau of Investigation spokesman told the AP. Holmes County Sheriff's Office Capt. Sam Chambers believes that White showed up after getting a call about the fight, and got upset since both of his parents were in the church at the time.

The daughter of cosmetics tycoon Ron Perelman is locked in a legal battle with her uncle over millions she says he stole from her. Samantha Perelman is already rich. Her father is worth an estimated $12 billion. Nonetheless, she is vying with Samantha’s dead mother’s brother for the other side of the family’s millions. CEO James Cohen of Hudson Media, the company that owns the ubiquitous airport and travel hub newsstands, is poised for war with the Perelmans over an estimated $600 million. Daddy's girl: Seen here at this year's Costume Institute Gala with dad Ron Perelman, Samantha Perelman is suing Hudson News heir uncle James Cohen over $600 million inheritance . The younger Perelman, a 22-year-old Columbia graduate student, is claiming Cohen coerced her grandfather—his father—out of his millions as he lay dying and cost Perelman her inheritance. ‘At the end of the day, it’s a 55-year-old man who wants to get his way faced by a 22-year-old girl who knows what the intentions of her mother and grandfather would have been,’ Perelman told the New York Daily News. ‘I’ve been completely washed out of the family.’ Or at least one side of it. Perelman is the daughter of former Daily News gossip columnist Claudia Cohen, whose father, Robert Cohen, built Hudson News into a retail empire starting with a Newark, New Jersey news stand. But as her grandfather lay dying, Samantha Perelman says her uncle James tricked him into rewriting his will three times to exclude her. Heiresses: Samantha with her late mother, former gossip columnist Claudia Cohen, in 2005. Soon after her mother died in 2007, Samantha claims in a lawsuit that her uncle started cheating her out of her grandfather's newspaper stand fortune . Claudia Cohen died of cancer in 2007 and left her own fortune, around $60 million, to her beloved daughter. From that moment on, Perelman alleges, James Cohen began to funnel his family’s money away from her. First she says he swindled her out of millions by using his right to buy her out of her share of her grandfather’s Palm Beach, Florida mansion. So, instead of $11 million, Perelman got the book value of $178,000. Whose battle? Ron Perelman with his ex-wife, the late Claudia Cohen. Perelman is himself a billionaire stakeholder in Revlon. Though he's fought with the Cohens over millions before, daughter Samantha says this fight is her own . Perelman also alleges she’s been cheated out of a $25 million bequest, a $5 million trust fund, an Englewood, New Jersey home and was even forced to pay James back a $10 million loan her mother had taken from her grandfather. Perelman’s father Ron Perelman, whose made billions through leveraged buyouts of companies and his stake in Revlon cosmetics, stepped in the ring when his former brother-in-law chose to buy Samantha out of her share of the Florida mansion. Since then, a clash of the titans has ensued. Perelman lost the challenge to the Florida home buyout. And in New Jersey, Perleman sued again to get Robert Cohen mentally incompetent, which would have invalidated his will. He lost both. The elder Perelman, a well-known buyout king, has been in the spotlight himself many times. The 70-year-old has seven other children and has been married five times, including a 2000 to 2006 union to actress Ellen Barkin. Family drama: James Cohen, seen here with his wife, is battling niece Samantha Perelman over millions she claims he cheated her out of coercing his late father to change his will three times. Cohen denies the claim . Nonetheless, Samantha maintains this battle is hers and hers alone. ‘There is this misconception that it’s two battling tycoons on each side of the Hudson,’ Samantha told the Daily News. ‘This is my case,’ she said. ‘This is my fight. It has nothing to do with my father. I’m lucky to have a supportive father.’ Samantha says she’s in the litigant’s chair now and has filed suit in New Jersey in an attempt to get her grandfather’s will invalidated and get the millions she says she’s owed. Meanwhile, Cohen is denying claims he coerced his father into changing his will to his own benefit and suggests Samantha was removed from the will because the late elder Cohen hated her father. The case goes to trial in September.","Samantha Perelman will likely inherit billions from father Ron Perelman .

An Apple Maps screen-shot of a New York City street on an iPhone screen recently posted online looks terrifyingly post-apocalyptic. The image features a desolate stretch of road littered with rubbish and lined with ghost-like yellow cabs, perhaps shells left to rust when the inevitable zombie apocalypse struck the city. The buildings look rundown and there are no people to speak of. New York City: Post apocalypse or just a regular day? 'New York: by Salvador Dali,' wrote a user on Imgur. 'Steve Jobs is rolling in his grave. And consequently rising from it,' quipped another. The Apple Maps app has been copping flack ever since it was introduced in 2012. At Gizmodo, Brian Barrett critiqued the app less than 24 hours after it was introduced: . 'Like so many things in life, Apple's horrific new Maps app would be funny if it weren't so sad. But after Apple decided to ditch Google Maps for its own troubled offering in iOS 6, users have been left with bad directions, incorrect business listings, and a missing Statue of Liberty,' he wrote. Tidal wave: The Google Maps Lions Gate Bridge in Vancouver (right), and the Apple Maps (left) version, which would have you believe it has turned sideways, and also that it's integrated with Highway 1A - which it hasn't been since 1959 . Other criticisms include showing the wrong location of the Apple Store in Sydney, Australia, marking an entire city as a hospital, wrongly classifying a nursery as an airport, placing the city of Cork in Ireland inside the city of Dublin, and identifying the nearest gas station to be as far as 76 miles away from the user's location . Another potentially disastrous error in the app sent Australians looking for the town of Mildura into the middle of a national park with no water supply, 43 miles from the town.

An Indiana couple got the shock of their life on Thursday night after shooting and killing what they thought was a bobcat - only to discover it was actually a leopard. The incident occurred following a number of attacks against cats and dogs just outside of Charlestown in Clark County, Indiana. Concerned for the safety of her own pets, the couple - who wishes to remain anonymous - contacted a local wildlife official. This leopard was accidentally shot and killed on Thursday by a homeowner concerned that something was attacking local cats and dogs . They suggested the attacks might be the work of a local bobcat and recommended they keep an eye out for the bobcats, especially at night. In a bid to end the attacks, the woman and her boyfriend decided to take turns watching the area surrounding their home. Late on Thursday night the woman was outside near her pool, when she saw a dark shadow moving about in the bushes. She called to her boyfriend, who grabbed a gun and shot at the dark shadow. The poor unfortunate leopard, left, and, right, a bobcat . The couple knew they had hit something after hearing a ‘horrible squeal’ but when they ran over to see what they had hit, it turned out to be the leopard. ‘The cat in these photographs has been identified tentatively as a leopard,’ Phil Bloom, a spokesperson for the Indiana Department of Natural Resources told WDRB News. ‘Perhaps an immature cat about nine months old. DNR is attempting to determine who it belonged to, or where it came from.’ Conservation officers believe the animal was someone's pet because it was in a healthy condition. Leopards are not native to North America and a permit is needed to keep one in Indiana. A mile from where the cat was found is the Wild life In Need refuge center. Owner Tim Stark told WDRB that for the past week he had set traps after receiving calls from a neighbor who had seen the large cat.

New York officials have ripped out multiple CitiBike docking stations after rich residents said they didn't want them cluttering their streets. At least 10 stations for the bike share scheme have been removed since they were installed on Memorial Day, including one located outside the West Soho co-op of Man Men star John Slattery. According to The New York Post, some stations were striped from streets after legal threats and neighborhood petitions but others required a simple phone call for wealthy stakeholders to make the bikes disappear. Bike share: New York officials have ripped out multiple CitiBike docking stations after rich residents said they didn't want them cluttering their streets . Racks outside Barry Diller's IAC Building in Chelsea miraculously appeared on the other side of the street while a station outside a Midtown East condo that is home to millionaires vanished after installation. However, street vendors and community groups in other parts of the city have failed to command such sway. 'I've been disappointed to see CitiBike stations moved in wealthier neighborhoods,' attorney Jim Walden told The Post. 'You would think (the city) would want to avoid even the appearance that struggling artists would be treated differently than highfalutin financiers.' Rich resident: Stations have been moved or removed outside the West Soho co-op of Man Men star John Slattery, pictured left, and outside the headquarter's of IAC, where boss Barry Diller, right, holds parties . Walden is trying to get the City to remove a station on Soho's Petrosino Square, and has filed an injunction with 600 signatures and 132 letters to the Department of Transportation. But it remains it place. Meanwhile, racks at Liberty Street and Broadway have displaced five food carts that used to park there but activists couldn't persuade officials to relocate that 40-bike station. 'They ignored us, basically,' Street Vendor Project director at the Urban Justice Center Sean Basinski told The Post. 'It seems like a lot of the fancy rich people in condos got them moved, but the immigrant street vendors had no luck.' Swanky: Famed architect Frank Gehry designed the Chelsea headquarters of IAC, pictured . According to The Post, the city has stubbornly refused to remove a station outside Frank's Bike Shop on the Lower East Side despite 1,000 people signing a petition claiming the rack's placement would kill off business for the independent store. Attorney Steven Sladkus claims he's helped to block three docking stations, with the city caving to his demands while on his way to file court papers. 'I can guarantee you won't see a CitiBike rack in front of Mayor Bloomberg’s town house' when the program expands north of 59th Street, Sladkus told The Post. 'Maybe the same (courtesy) should have been given to all other property owners in the city.' Unsuccessful: But community groups and residents in other areas have failed to get the city to budge on the bikes' locations . He pushed the Department of Transportation to move a 29-bike station from the Milan Condominium at East 55th Street and Second Avenue, where a three-bedroom home sells for $3.7 million. The penthouse in the 31-story tower was reportedly used for upcoming Martin Scorsese film 'The Wolf of Wall Street' featuring Leonardo DiCaprio. Another load of CitiBikes were moved from outside the Frank Gehry-designed IAC Building in Chelsea after managers contacted the city, an IAC spokeswoman told The Post. The company said they moved the station across the street because of safety concerns due to the M14 bus, however boss Barry Diller regularly holds swanky parties in the building's lobby and an unnamed worker said the racks would have got in the way. The Department didn't respond to The Post for comment.","At least 10 docking stations have been moved or removed since the bike share scheme launched on Memorial Day .

That's the message the father of the only American prisoner of war in Afghanistan conveyed to his son's captors. The message came at a rally Saturday in Idaho, the home state of Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who was captured by Taliban fighters four years ago after completing a guard shift at a combat outpost. Jani and Bob Bergdahl, the parents of captured U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, address a rally held in their son's honor in Haley, Idaho . The details of his capture differ - the Taliban claims he was ambushed after he drunkenly wandered off base, while U.S. State Department officials deny that claim. Bergdahl - in a video recorded by his captors - says he fell behind while on patrol and was taken by Taliban fighters. The rally was in response to new hopes that prisoner exchange could be on the table during upcoming peace talks between the Taliban and U.S. officials. Taliban fighters are pushing for the release of five detainees at Guantanamo Bay - and Bergdahl may be one of their only bargaining chips. Donning a long beard, Bob Bergdahl spoke to roughly 1,000 of his son's supporters - many of them war veterans - about putting an end to the 12 years of violence in Afghanistan. 'Bowe, my son, if you . can hear me...you are part of the peace process, you are part of . ending the Afghan war,' he told the crowd, according to multiple media outlets who attended the event. 'Have faith. Do good works. Tell the truth, and . have the patience that can only come from God. We are being tested.' Beard: Bob Bergdahl hasn't shaved since his son was captured four years ago . Solidarity: hundreds of war vets showed up in support of Bergdahl at a rally in Idaho last week . He went on to say, 'I will not leave you on the battlefield. You are not forgotten.' Bob Bergdahl has not cut his beard since his son was first captured. He's also studied Pashto, an Afghan and Pakistani language he used to deliver the part of his speech intended for his son's captors. Bowe's mother, Jani Bergdahl, said talks of prisoner exchange has her and her family optimistic that their four-year nightmare could be coming to an end. 'So many of you have . come from far away, and we appreciate the sacrifices you made to make . this possible,' she told supporters. Sergeant Bergdahl: Bowe Bergdahl has been a hostage of the Taliban since 2009 . P.O.W.: Bowe Bergdahl is the 'part of the peace process,' according to his father . She then sent a message to her son: 'We love you and are eagerly awaiting your return . home' Last week, State Department officials confirmed that they expect prisoner exchange to be included in the upcoming talks, to be held 'in the coming days' in Doha, Qatar. However, the United States has traditionally not negotiated with hostage takers. Although, officials say no decision has been made about whether to move Taliban detainees out of Guantanamo Bay. Any plan to release any detainees would require Congressional approval. Hostage: Taliban forces say they will consider trading Bergdahl for five Guantanamo Bay detainees . Regardless, the Bergdahl's say they will not stop fighting to win their son's freedom. 'A father does not leave . his son on the battlefield,' Bob Bergdahl said. 'I live in Afghanistan, my phone on Afghan . time,' he said. 'I will not leave you on the battlefield. You are not . forgotten. You will not be forgotten. We pray soon you will come home.'","Bowe Bergdahl was captured by Taliban fighters in 2009 .

Seven U.S. soldiers and a member of the NATO-led coalition were killed on Saturday in one of the deadliest days for Americans and other foreign troops in Afghanistan in recent months, as the Taliban continued attacks as part of their spring offensive. The renewed violence came as Afghan President Hamid Karzai acknowledged at a news conference that regular payments his government has received from the CIA for more than a decade would continue. Karzai also said that talks on a U.S.-Afghan bilateral security agreement to govern future American military presence in the country had been delayed because of conditions the Afghans were placing on the deal. The U.S.-led coalition reported that five international troops were killed by a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan, and coalition spokesman Capt. Luca Carniel confirmed that all five were American. Dangerous: Five Americans were killed Saturday in Afghanistan's Maiwand district . The coalition did not disclose the . location of the roadside bombing. However, Javeed Faisal, a spokesman . for the governor of Kandahar province, said the coalition patrol hit the . bomb in the Maiwand district of the province, the spiritual birthplace . of the Taliban. Later, the coalition reported that a . soldier with the Afghan National Army turned his weapon on coalition . troops in the west, killing two in the most recent of so-called insider . attacks. Such attacks by members of the Afghan security forces against . their fellow colleagues or international troops have eroded confidence . in the Afghan forces as they work to take over from foreign forces. Both killed were American, according . to two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose . the nationalities ahead of an official announcement. Another coalition service member was . killed in an insurgent attack in northern Afghanistan, the NATO-led . force said. It did not provide any further details of the incident. It was the fourth time since last summer that seven Americans have been killed on a single day in the war. On March 12, a Black Hawk helicopter . crashed outside Kandahar, killing five U.S. troops. Two more U.S. troops . were killed that day by an insider attack. And on April 6, Afghan militants . killed six Americans, including a young female diplomat, and an Afghan . doctor in a pair of attacks in southern Afghanistan. The three U.S. service members, two U.S. civilians and the doctor were killed when the . group was struck by an explosion while traveling to donate books to a . school. A seventh American, a civilian, was killed in a separate . insurgent attack in the east. On Aug. 16, 2012, seven American . service members were killed in two attacks in Kandahar province. Six . were killed when their helicopter was shot down by insurgents and one . soldier died in a roadside bomb explosion. Hot bed: Soldiers stationed in the Maiwand district circa March 2010. Three British soldiers were also killed in nearby Helmand province April 30 . At the news conference, Karzai said he . had met earlier in the day with the Kabul station chief of the CIA and . was reassured that the agency's payments to the Afghan government would . continue. The New York Times had reported that for more than a decade, . the CIA had given the Afghan National Security Council tens of millions . of dollars in monthly payments delivered in suitcases, backpacks and . plastic shopping bags. Karzai said he told the station chief: . ""`Because of all these rumors in the media, please do not cut all this . money because we really need it. We want to continue this sort of . assistance.' And he promised that they are not going to cut this money."" Karzai described the payments as a . form of ""government-to-government"" assistance, and while he wouldn't say . how much the CIA gave to the National Directorate of Security, which is . the Afghan intelligence service, he said the financial help was very . useful. He claimed that much of the money was used to care for wounded . employees of the NDS, Afghanistan's intelligence service, and . operational expenses. ""We have spent it in different areas (and) solved lots of our problems,"" Karzai said. He said the CIA payments were made in . cash and that ""all the money which we have spent, receipts have been . sent back to the intelligence service of the United States monthly."" The CIA declined to comment on Saturday. Birthplace: An Afghani officer stands guard in Maiwand. The region is often called the Taliban's 'spiritual birthplace' During the news conference at the . presidential palace, Karzai also discussed ongoing negotiations on a . U.S.-Afghan bilateral security agreement. He said talks had been delayed . because of certain conditions that Afghanistan was insisting be . included in the pact, which will govern a U.S. military presence after . 2014 when nearly all foreign combat troops are to have finished their . withdrawal from Afghanistan. The talks, which started in late 2012, are . set to last up to a year. President Barack Obama has not said . how many troops will remain, although there have been estimates ranging . from 8,000 to 12,000. It is unlikely such an announcement will be made . until the security agreement is signed. Those troops would help train . Afghan forces and also carry out operations against al-Qaida and other . militant groups. Karzai said Afghanistan was ready to . sign a deal as long as the American government in exchange for being . able to stay on bases in the country agrees to terms of Afghan security, . funding assistance and help with training and equipping Afghan security . forces. It is thought that the contentious issue of providing U.S. troops immunity from Afghan law is a low priority for the Afghan . government in the negotiations. The Afghan government has not said how . much rent it would want for three or four U.S. bases, but it is . believed to be in the billions. Afghanistan is also thought to be . seeking security guarantees to protect its porous borders, including the . frontier with Pakistan that is the main infiltration route for . insurgents who retain sanctuary in Pakistan's lawless tribal areas. It was unclear how Karzai expected the United States or any of its allies to guarantee Afghanistan's borders against attack. Renewed: A child herds sheep in Maiwand.

A Harvard professor took to the podium at a finance conference Friday and called major influencer of modern economics John Maynard Keynes wrong about his philosophies because he was gay and childless. During a question and answer session in Carlsbad, California, well-known historian Niall Ferguson was asked how he felt about the theories of English economist John Maynard Keynes versus those of Edmund Burke. What the prominent Obama critic said in response hushed the crowd of over 500. Related? Harvard professor Niall Ferguson told a group of 500 in California he believed thinker John Keynes didn't care about society because he was gay . According to Tom Kostigen, editor-at-large of Financial Advisor magazine, Ferguson made it clear that he believed Keynes was uninterested in the what was good for society, basically because of his sexual orientation. ‘Ferguson asked the audience how many children Keynes had,’ wrote Kostigen in Financial Advisor. ‘He explained that Keynes had none because he was a homosexual and was married to a ballerina, with whom he likely talked of ""poetry"" rather than procreated.’ Kostigen said many of the audience members took offense at the remark, but that Ferguson continued. ‘Ferguson, author of The Great Degeneration: How Institutions Decay and Economies Die,' wrote Kostigen, ‘says it's only logical that Keynes would take this selfish worldview because he was an ""effete"" member of society.’ Cold: Ferguson said the British economist Keynes, pictured, had selfish ideas as a result of his sexuality . It is worth noting that, though many conservatives use the term ‘Keynesian economics’ as derogatory, Keynes was not wholly liberal. Keynes, whose most famous quote is ‘In the long run we are all dead,’ once called the market system the ‘best safeguard of the variety of life’ that preserved the ‘most secure and successful choices of former generations.’ However, rather than to Keynes’ ‘selfish worldview,’ Kostigen wrote that Ferguson endeared himself during the Q&A to Burke’s ‘social contract,’ a term used largely by liberals today. Married: John Maynard Keynes' wife Lydia Lopokova was a ballerina. Ferguson said they talked about poetry rather than have children . Ferguson, a conservative former advisor to John McCain, has been a vocal critic of the Obama presidency from its beginnings. Perhaps most notably, the historian wrote a Newsweek cover story in the months before the 2012 presidential campaign entitled ‘Hit the Road, Barack,’ that many, including New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, criticized for misrepresenting facts. Since Kostigen’s May 3 post, the story has spread quickly across the web. Business Insider called Ferguson’s remarks ‘bizarre and offensive’ and the Huffington post reported that many, including Reuters finance blogger Felix Salmon, were quick to condemn them. On Saturday, Ferguson took to his personal website’s blog to make an ‘unqualified apology’ for his earlier comments. Past: Ferguson, a noted historian, was roundly criticized for a 2012 Newsweek story many say misrepresented Obama's policies . ‘I should not have suggested,’ wrote Ferguson, ‘that Keynes was indifferent to the long run because he had no children, nor that he had no children because he was gay. This was doubly stupid. First, it is obvious that people who do not have children also care about future generations. Second, I had forgotten that Keynes’s wife Lydia miscarried. ‘My disagreements with Keynes’s economic philosophy have never had anything to do with his sexual orientation.’ Ferguson went on to apologize to his colleagues, students, and friends ‘straight and gay’ who have every right to be disappointed.’ According to his website, Ferguson is the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University; a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University; and a Senior Research Fellow at Jesus College, Oxford. Sorry: A day after calling the late economist 'effete,' Ferguson apologized for his remarks on his personal blog .","Niall Ferguson reportedly called the influential 20th century economist uninterested in society's future because he was childless and 'effete'

Hundreds of women are being recalled for breast cancer checks amid fears that a bungling junior hospital doctor mistakenly gave them the all-clear. Letters were last week sent to 272 patients who underwent routine breast screening over 18 months from January 2011. The women, who were originally told follow-ups were not required, have been asked to return to The Royal Bournemouth Hospital in Dorset for further checks after a male junior doctor there failed to carry out correct procedures at their screening sessions. Royal Bournemouth Hospital, where around 250 women attended breast screenings that may not have been carried out properly. Consultants at the Dorset hospital raised concerns over a junior doctor . The unnamed medic is now under . investigation over his alleged lapse following complaints about his . performance at the clinic up to July 2012. Consultants who run the breast clinic . raised the alarm as they were unhappy with the way the doctor conducted . his initial assessment of some of the patients. Hospital bosses said his work . ‘potentially did not meet our usual high standards’ and stressed that . the recall was ‘precautionary’. A spokeswoman for The Royal Bournemouth declined to name the junior doctor, but said he was no longer working at the hospital. ‘We have no evidence of any harm to . the patients seen by this junior doctor,’ she said. ‘However, as a . precaution, we are bringing some patients back for an assessment by a . consultant. At this stage, we have invited those patients who were only . seen by this junior doctor.’ Around 250 patients were screened for breast cancer have been recalled for another assessment . The doctor is being investigated by . the General Medical Council over the incident, the spokeswoman added. The hospital has also asked the Royal College of Surgeons to assist in a . review. Tony Skene, consultant breast surgeon . at The Royal Bournemouth, said: ‘Although we have found no evidence of . any harm, the safety of our patients is our number one priority. ‘We do, however, realise that for . those patients who we do recall, this may lead to additional anxiety and . we apologise for the distress that this may cause. ‘The Trust is being proactive with . this recall, which is about clinical standards. There are no other . concerns. I want to assure all the patients we contact that they will be . offered a prompt appointment, with access to a support telephone line . in the interim should they need it.’ Emma Pennery, clinical director of . support charity Breast Cancer Care, said: ‘While there is currently no . evidence of any misdiagnosis in this instance, a recall to a breast . clinic can inevitably cause a great deal of anxiety for both patients . and their families. We would hope that in such a rare instance, the . hospital will see these patients as quickly as possible.’ Paula Shobbrook, The Royal . Bournemouth Hospital’s director of nursing, said extra clinics were . being arranged so that women affected could be seen as soon as possible. A telephone hotline is also available for anxious patients seeking . support. ‘We’re inviting them back to reassure them and so that they can . see one of our consultants,’ she said. ‘We have been reviewing the records carefully and have sent the patients  a letter. ‘We’ve also put on additional clinics so that patients can come back in.’ The NHS Breast Screening Programme is . estimated to save 1,400 lives a year in England alone. One in eight . women will develop breast cancer at some stage in their life. Eighty per . cent of breast cancers occur in women over 50. Women aged between 50 and 70 are . invited for checks every three years. In some areas, this is being . extended to include those between 47 and 73. Those over 70 can ask to be . screened. Sally Greenbrook of the charity . Breakthrough Breast Cancer said: ‘Any variation from the usual high . standards of breast screening is extremely worrying. We are pleased to . see that the hospital is acting with urgency in reassuring those . affected and ensuring that this does not happen again. ‘We hope it doesn’t put women off . attending their screening appointment, as early detection offers the . best chance of a successful outcome.’","250 patients have been called back to Royal Bournemouth Hospital in Dorset .

She's had a rough week, after her ex-husband Charlie Sheen accused her of abusing drugs and losing her custody of her children. But Brooke Mueller is actually on-board with the choice to have her sons placed another of his exes, actress Denise Richards. Despite the unusual situation, TMZ reports the 35-year-old is 'glad' the twin boys - Bob and Max - ended up with the Scary Movie actress and not Brooke's own mother. The four-year-old boys were taken out of the former reality star's custody on Thursday night after the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services felt her home was an 'unsafe environment' due to her suspected drug use. Sources told TMZ: 'Brooke feels Denise is a great parent and will give her boys everything they need while she seeks help. 'Brooke is grateful to Denise and knowing her boys are in good hands is allowing her to focus on herself and get better.' Charlie Sheen also echoed in his support of the custody shift, stating that he would 'fully cooperate and fully participate' in any future proceedings. 'Charlie supports the actions of the Department of Children and Family . Services,' a statement from his rep read. 'He knows Max and Bob are safe in a stable, loving . environment with Denise and the boys' sisters.' Prior to the Department visiting her home Brooke was allegedly 'placed on an Involuntary Psychiatric Hold' days before her twin sons were taken away from her.

A grieving widow has described how her terminally ill husband was failed by the new NHS 111 helpline in the last hours of his life. Kim Green was trying to get a nurse to administer pain relief to her 53-year-old husband Jonothan, who was dying of prostate cancer. She said she was on the phone to a female call centre worker for nearly an hour, but the employee was apparently unable to summon any of the local district nurses as they were not answering their phones. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Heartbroken: Kim Green, left, called the new NHS 111 service in an unsuccessful attempt to get a nurse to visit her cancer stricken husband Jonathan, right. He died later that day . Devastating: Mrs Green is pictured with her husband Jonathan, who died from cancer last week . Mrs Green, 36, who has two sons, . said: ‘The horrible thing is, I should have been sitting next to him . holding his hand, reassuring him help was on the way, and I couldn’t . because I was on the phone frantically trying to get somebody to help . him. ‘It was absolutely awful. I don’t know whether that made his anxiety levels worse or not, but it certainly didn’t help him.’ By chance, Mrs Green spotted a . district nurse going to a nearby care home for adults with learning . disabilities. She ran into the street and was able to persuade the nurse . to administer the medication to her husband. Upsetting: Mrs Green is now left with the feeling that her husband's anxiety levels in his final hours may have worsened because of the stress caused by her unsuccessful attempt to get a nurse to visit . He died hours later last Wednesday at his home in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. Mrs Green’s account comes days after . NHS England, the new body in charge of running the health service, . launched an urgent review of the 111 helpline. It has replaced NHS Direct and GP . out-of-hours numbers and is meant to make it easier for patients to get . medical advice, especially at evenings and weekends. But it has struggled to cope with . high volumes of calls and there have been reports of critically-ill . patients waiting for as long as 11 hours to speak to a nurse. Mr Green, who ran a taxi firm with . his wife, had begun suffering from violent spasms and although Mrs Green . had the necessary medication, it could only be administered via syringe . by a nurse. A&E departments are braced for a surge of patients over the bank holiday as a result of flaws with 111 . Telling Sky News about her ordeal . with the 111 call centre, she said: ‘Initially they phoned the nursing . team and they wouldn’t answer their phone. Nobody would answer the . phone, they couldn’t get hold of anybody. ‘I was on the phone while she [the . call centre operator] kept coming backwards and forwards, “I’m trying . this, I’m trying that, I’m trying the other” and she just couldn’t get . hold of anybody.’ Although Mrs Green does not in any . way blame NHS 111 for her husband’s death, she believes it could have . been more peaceful had a nurse come more quickly. Since the 111 system was introduced . earlier this year, many hospital A&E units have been overwhelmed . with patients who have abandoned the helpline or have been given the . wrong advice. At least three people have died as a result of flaws in the system, while the real figures are thought to be higher . Nursing leaders say that waiting . times of 12 hours are now routine and with some units so overcrowded . that patients are being put on trolleys in cupboards. This weekend hospitals have been bracing themselves to be even busier than usual. Many have recruited extra doctors and . nurses to work or have put in place contingency plans which would see . temporary wards used for additional patients. Last week figures obtained by Pulse . magazine revealed that the helpline was investigating 22 incidents . involving possible poor care, including three deaths. The 111 system is run by private GP out of hours firms, NHS Direct or ambulance services in different areas of the country. NHS England has pledged to fine these organisations if they are found to be failing to run the helpline properly. A spokesman for the NHS 111 service in Buckinghamshire said: ‘This is a very sad case and our sympathy goes out to the family. ‘We take the responsibility for the safety and well-being of our patients extremely seriously. ‘When a concern such as this is . raised about the NHS 111 service we undertake an incident review . involving experienced clinical staff. This allows us to identify clear . actions so that lessons can be learned and acted on quickly and . thoroughly. ‘We would urge the family to contact us directly so that we can discuss this case further with them.’","Kim Green's husband Jonathan was in pain and dying of cancer .

Appearing . in court for the first time since the Arizona jury was unable to decide her . sentence for murder, Arias last week swapped her prim, collared shirts . and business-like attire that she sported throughout her lengthy murder . trial for the standard issue stripes now that she is behind bars. The . procedural hearing lacked the sizzle of the five-month trial, which concluded in May, that . attracted a global following and had spectators waiting in line in the . middle of the night to get a coveted seat in the courtroom. Last Thursday, the courtroom was about two-thirds full, the hearing was not televised, and there were no arguments in open court. That verdict will come even later than previously expected, as the judge ruled today that the next hearing is scheduled for July 18. Smiling through the process: Jodi Arias has already been convicted of murder but now she awaits her sentencing . Jury selection alone could take weeks, given the difficulty of seating an impartial panel in the high-profile case. Prosecutors . have the option of taking the death penalty off the table, and Stephens . would then sentence Arias to one of two punishments: life in prison or . the more unlikely life in prison with the possibility of release after . 25 years. If prosecutors do pursue death, a new panel must be seated to determine a sentence. If another deadlock occurs, the death penalty would automatically be removed, leaving the judge to sentence Arias to one of the life-in-prison options. Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery said last week his office continues to prepare for a retrial aimed at securing a death sentence. He had previously said he is confident an impartial jury can be seated to determine Arias' punishment but added that he is open to input from defense lawyers and the victim's family about possibly scrapping a new trial in favor of a life sentence for Arias. Meanwhile, after losing motions for mistrials, appeals to higher courts and efforts to quit the case altogether, Arias' attorneys tried a new tactic this month, appealing to the court of public opinion while hoping to influence Montgomery's decision. Decisions: The next hearing will be held on July 18 and that is when they will begin the process of picking a new jury for the sentencing portion . 'It is solely for them to determine if continuing to pursue a death sentence upon Ms. Arias, who is already facing a mandatory life sentence, is a good and proper use of taxpayer resources,' defense attorneys Kirk Nurmi and Jennifer Willmott wrote in a statement provided to The Arizona Republic. Taxpayers footed the bill for Arias' court-appointed attorneys at a cost so far of nearly $1.7million, a price tag that will only balloon if the case moves forward. Arias, 32, admitted she killed Alexander, but claimed it was self-defense after he attacked her. Prosecutors argued it was premeditated murder carried out in a jealous rage after the victim wanted to end their affair and planned a trip to Mexico with another woman. After murdering Alexander, Arias left her ex-boyfriend's body in his shower where friends found him about five days later. She testified for 18 days during her five-month trial, describing for jurors an abusive childhood, cheating boyfriends, dead-end jobs, a shocking sexual relationship with Alexander, and her contention that he had grown physically abusive.","Arias, 32, found guilty of murder of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander .

A California woman suspected in the shooting death of her longtime girlfriend was fatally shot by police over the weekend after she pulled a gun on the officers as they were on routine patrol in an alley in Santa Ana. However, it turns out that the gun 35-year-old Jessica Gonzalez pulled on officers was just a toy, and friends of the slain woman believe her death was the result of suicide-by-cop. 'Suicide-by-cop': friends say Gonzalez 'wanted to go out like this' According to authorities, a woman - later identified by her family and friends as Gonzalez - approached two patrol officers with a gun in an alley in the 800 block of South Townsend Street. Fearing for their lives, the officers opened fire on Gonzalez. She was taken to a local hospital where she later was pronounced dead. Gonzalez had been on the run after fatally shooting her girlfriend of 13 years, 44-year-old Jennifer Solorio, outside of the apartment the couple shared on Thursday afternoon. When police got to the building - in the 200 block of East Palmyra Avenue in Orange - they found Solorio bleeding on the sidewalk. Victim: witnesses say there was a woman waiting for Jennifer Solario (pictured) in a car as she tried to flee her apartment with a box of clothing . 'Jessica and Jennifer have been together 13 years and Jennifer  had a friend over for like, two days.

Jeremy Forrest is to serve five and a half years after being found guilty of abduction and five counts of having sex with a child. Today it has been revealed that the maths tutor told his parents during a prison visit: ‘I love her and we want to get married,’ and that his victim is planning on visiting him in jail. Despite his confession of having under-age sex with his daughter – and running away with her to France when she was 15 years old - the victim’s father said he wants to shake Forrest’s hand. ‘I’d like to visit him in prison and, shake his hand, and say, “Thanks for looking after my daughter”,’ he told The Sun.

Support: Carrie Hanspaul, 33, revealed her brother's plan to marry schoolgirl . The victim’s father would not condemn . Forrest saying that although he wishes the couple would have waited . until his daughter was 16 to have a physical relationship, he never . feared for her safety. He added: ‘People get suspended sentences for worse crimes. ‘Hopefully with good behaviour he may be freed on parole in a few years.’ Meanwhile, Forrest’s sister revealed the couple’s plans to meet up with him behind bars. ‘The girl’s been told that she can visit him,’ Carrie Hanspaul, 33, said. 'She’s planning on doing that as soon as she can. Jeremy told me that he’d been told that she wanted to visit. ‘In court on the day of his conviction, he said to me, ‘‘Tell her she’s allowed to visit,’’ and when I did she just smiled.’ The victim is currently living with her stepfather after her relationship with her mother deteriorated. In a witness statement during court proceedings the teenager’s mother said her relationship with the girl would ‘never be the same again’. She added: ‘I feel like the daughter I know has died and I’m grieving for her.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Father of Forrest's victim will walk her down the aisle if they marry .

Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev last night dramatically intervened in media tycoon Alexander Lebedev’s battle to avoid jail over a TV studio fracas with a property mogul. ‘It was no more than a minor incident that does not even deserve a court hearing,’ said the 82-year-old Russian elder statesman. His statement amounts to a powerful criticism of the legal system under President Vladimir Putin which has doggedly pursued the newspaper owner in what is widely condemned as a show trial. Ally: Lebedev, left, has received the support of Gorbachev (pictured together at the Evening Standard . Lebedev, 53, faces up to five years in jail after being charged with the draconian offence of hooliganism motivated by ‘political hatred’ for striking businessman Sergei Polonsky after a barrage of provocation. Unlike Polonsky, who is believed to have jumped bail in Cambodia and is now thought to be hiding in an Israeli bolthole, Lebedev – funder of the Independent titles and the London Evening Standard – has rejected the chance to flee abroad and is ready to face the Russian courts. Polonsky is seeking to gain Israeli citizenship to avoid being extradited to Russia where he faces separate legal action over £121 million fraud and embezzlement charges. ‘I know Alexander as a good man, a person who is free in his judgment and speaks his mind on the economy, public affairs and politics,’ Gorbachev told The Mail on Sunday in a exclusive statement last night. ‘He takes full advantage of the freedoms brought to our country by Perestroika. I also know him as a civil society activist who has supported charitable projects particularly in the area of children’s health. Moral man: Alexander Lebedev and Elena Perminova with sons Nikita, 3 and Egor,1, is facing a battle to avoid jail . ‘On the eve of the 300 anniversary of St Petersburg, he financed the building of the Childhood Leukaemia Centre which was named after Raisa Gorbachev. I think that speaks to his character as a moral man.” The charge against Lebedev is controversial, with some supporters claiming it is driven by the Kremlin and amounts to an attack on media freedom. Lebedev, with Gorbachev, is an owner of hard-hitting investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta which regularly exposes alleged corruption in the Russian elite. However, Lebedev last week hit out at the Western media for portraying the legal action as a vendetta by Putin. Lebedev’s son Evgeny – now in charge of the family’s UK newspaper interests – has said his father’s life could be in danger if he is sent to prison. The case resumes tomorrow and a verdict is likely in July. ‘My choice is between, I think, a year in prison and a big fine,’ said the tycoon after Friday’s hearing. It has been branded a farce with one prosecution witness asked to give evidence after she stepped off a bus in Moscow, purely on the basis that she saw the TV show. Last week, the judge refused to probe claims that Polonsky is in Israel and not – as his lawyers claim – on bail in Cambodia where he is accused of kidnapping and assault.","Lebedev could be jailed for a TV studio fracas with property mogul .

His announcement comes as Russia sends in advanced missiles to Syria in a move that highlights the depth of its support for President Bashar al-Assad. Following a meeting with Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Mr Obama insisted it . was important to get more specific details about alleged chemical . attacks. Declaration: President Barack Obama has said the US has seen evidence of chemical weapons being used in Syria. Following a meeting with Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Mr Obama insisted it was important to get more specific details . Last year Obama and Western leaders warned Syria that using chemical weapons would be crossing a 'red line.' If the latest claims are correct it could lead to greater Western military involvement in the two-year war, and Mr Obama emphasized yesterday that a whole range of diplomatic and military options were available. 'Our militaries are constantly sharing information. We have seen evidence of the use of chemical weapons inside Syria,' he said. Tension: Russian Navy's anti-aircraft ship Admiral Panteleyev is moored during a port call today in Limassol, Cyprus . Conflict: A group of warships from Russia's Pacific Fleet entered the Mediterranean waters for the first time in decades, in a period of high tension over the Syrian conflict . Support: Russia is a main supporter of the Syrian President's regime . 'Those chemical weapons inside of Syria also threaten our security over the long term as well as [that of] our allies and friends and neighbours.' However, he added that 'more specific information' was needed. Obama emphasized U.S. involvement in delivering 'food, shelter and medicine that is needed to save lives' as Turkey shields Syrian refugees. He also stressed the need for a Syrian future without its current dictator. 'We both agree that Bashar as-Assad needs to go,' Obama said, referring to Erdogan standing beside him. Meanwhile Russia has sent advanced antiship cruise missiles to Syria, American officials said yesterday. Russian . President Vladimr Putin remains opposed to the overthrow of Assad . despite talks with Prime Minster David Cameron last week. Although Russia has previously provided missiles, these ones are thought to be more effective. 'It . enables the regime to deter foreign forces looking to supply the . opposition from the sea, or from undertaking a more active role if a . no-fly zone or shipping embargo were to be declared at some point,' said . Nick Brown, editor in chief of IHS Jane’s International Defense Review . told the New York Times. Delivery: In 2007 Russia signed the deal to send a Yakhont missile to Syria . Opposed: Russian President Vladimr Putin remains opposed to the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad .

Yesterday news emerged that eyewitnesses and victims are claiming that government helicopters . have dropped at least two devices containing poisonous gas on the town of . Syrian town of Saraqeb. Doctors say one woman died and seven others suffered side . effects, according to the BBC. Intelligence gleaned by both the UK . and US indicated there is evidence that the increasingly beleaguered . regime of Syrian president Bashar Al Assad had used the weapons and in . particular the devastating nerve agent sarin, officials said . Last . month two Syrian officials denied the government has used chemical . weapons against rebel forces, saying the regime had no need for them. Injured: . A video posted on Facebook and YouTube appears to show victims of a . Syrian regime assault on Aleppo foaming at the mouth suggesting the use . of sarin gas last month . Syrian official Sharif Shehadeh . called the U.S. claims 'lies' and likened them to false accusations that . Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction ahead of the U.S. invasion . of that country.

There is . grave concern in the UK and US that its stockpile of chemical weapons – . approximately 1,000 tons, stored in 50 towns – could fall into the hands . of Al Qaeda to be turned on Western targets. Last . month a video posted on the Facebook page of a British-trained doctor . appeared to show victims of a Syrian regime assault on Aleppo foaming at . the mouth and showing symptoms consistent with a chemical weapons . attack. Witnesses said that containers were dropped from an aircraft and scattered their contents across the area.

He . said that they displayed symptoms of chemical exposure including . foaming at the mouth, constricted pupils and difficulty breathing. They were treated using chemical weapons antidote Atropine, Dr Habash claims. Experts claim that their injuries appear to be similar to those suffered by victims of an attack on Khan al-Assad, near Aleppo. UK . Foreign Secretary William Hague revealed last month that a soil sample . taken from Khan al-Assad had tested positive for a chemical agent.

The trademark white suit of Col Sanders has been sold to the head of KFC in Japan for $21,510. After buying the suit and black string tie at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, Masao ""Charlie"" Watanabe tried it on for size. The Japanese chief executive also bought other items of Sanders memorabilia, including the founder of the fried chicken chain's driver's Kentucky driver's license, which cost him $1,912. Original recipe: The head of KFC in Japan tries on Col Sanders' trademark suit which he bought for $21,510 . The collector, who had been in Texas on business when he heard about the auction, was one of hundreds of bidders vying for memorabilia which also included a gun belt owned by Jesse James and the leg irons used to restrain the abolitionist John Brown. 'Every child in Japan knows Colonel Sanders' face and his uniform,' Mr Watanabe said. Col Sanders is a popular figure in Japan, . and most KFC restaurants in the country have statues of him, Mr Watanabe said. He plans to display the suit, which comes with a clip on tie that did not belong to Col Sanders, at a restaurant in Tokyo. Harland Sanders first started serving his famous chicken from a service station in Corbin, Kentucky, in 1930. As his fame grew, he was made an honorary colonel by the state's governor in 1935. Trademark: Col Sanders gave the suit to a teenager for a Hallowe'en party in 1975 . Popular: Col Sanders is well known in Japan, where the KFCs have statues of him outside . After perfecting his secret blend of herbs and spices he started a franchise which, in ten years, had grown to 600 restaurants. Until his death at the age of 90, Col Sanders traveled the world visiting KFC restaurants. According to Heritage Auctions, the suit was given to a teenager whose family had sold a house to Col Sanders in 1975. While the house sale was being completed, the Col shared their house. On Hallowe'en, Mike Morris says Col Sanders gave him the trademark suit so he could go to a party dressed as the KFC founder. Other items of American history were sold at the Texas auction on Saturday. The leg irons clamped on Brown after his failed 1859 raid on a federal arsenal in Virginia was sold to an anonymous bidder for $13,145. Memorabilia: The Colonel's suit will go on display at a Tokyo KFC after being bought at auction in Dallas . Many scholars believe Brown and his raid hastened the start of the Civil War as he tried to end slavery. The Connecticut native and some followers seized the arsenal in an attempt to provide 100,000 weapons to slaves who never joined them. Brown was hanged for treason, murder and inciting a rebellion. The auction house also sold one of the two gun belts owned by Jesse James at the time of his death. It went for $16,730.","Suit will be displayed at Tokyo KFC where Col Sanders is a popular figure .

Jeremy told me that he’d been told that she wanted to visit. ‘In court on the day of his conviction, he said to me, ‘‘Tell her she’s allowed to visit,’’ and when I did she just smiled.’ Dad-in-law: The father of Jeremy Forrest's victim, pictured right, has said he gives their relationship their blessing and would like to thank the jailed teacher for 'taking care' of his daughter . The revelation came as it emerged that more than 100 people have illegally named the girl on social networking websites. Last night, The Mail on Sunday identified more than 120 posts on Facebook and Twitter that breach the lifelong anonymity given to victims of sexual offences. The girl – just 15 when she fled to France with Forrest – is also subject to court-imposed anonymity as a minor. Messenger: Forrest's sister Carrie Hanspaul, pictured arriving at court with her husband, said the victim smiled when she was told she was allowed to visit him in prison . However, following the teacher’s conviction on Thursday, many people commenting on the case online chose to defy the law and openly disclose the victim’s identity.

A man who had his ten-stone testicles removed says he is looking for love after getting his life back. Wesley Warren Jr, 48, carried his swollen scrotum around for five years until four surgeons spent 13 hours removing the mass in April. He had to wear a hooded top on his legs instead of trousers to accommodate his testicles, could not work, and struggled to walk or drive. Scroll down for video . Wesley Warren Jr's operation to remove his ten-stone testicles has left him hopeful that he will find love one day . His penis was buried so deeply within his groin that he had to urinate on himself instead of going to the toilet normally and could not enjoy a fulfilling sex life. Now, Mr Warren, from Las Vegas, says a romantic relationship could help him be happy again. 'I cannot express how ecstatic I’m feeling about the future,' he told the Sunday Mirror. 'And if some way somehow or another I can stumble upon love – any kind of love – I think I will finally be happy. 'I’m very thankful that I’ve been given my life back.' Mr Warren could only sit down with a milk crate between his legs after his scrotum swelled up, and said he missed simple everyday activities, such as going to the supermarket and post office. He had accidentally squashed his testicles getting out of bed, but antibiotics failed to make them return to their normal size. Doctors diagnosed him with scrotal lymphoedema, a severe build-up of fluid. The extremely rare condition is much more common in Africa and south-east Asia, where it is caused by parasites, than it is in the western world. Mr Warren was so desperate to escape the 'freak show' his life became that he considered auctioning his enormous testicle sac on eBay to raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for complicated surgery. The 48-year-old bachelor from Las Vegas had his surgery two months ago and was filmed for a Channel 4 documentary . He raised about $2,000 in donations after appearing on U.S. television, but social security officials stepped in and stopped his benefits. The testicles were getting heavier by the day and Mr Warren's health was deteriorating and he feared he could die on the operating table. Then Californian consultant Dr Joel Gelman offered to perform the procedure free of charge as long as Nevada's Medicaid system covered the cost of using a hospital theatre. He boasted that he had never lost a patient or testicle in similar operations. 'There are a lot of shows about makeovers, but this is a real makeover,' said Dr Gelman, the head of the Center for Reconstructive Urology at the University of California. 'He's basically a new man.' The operation, which saw 132.5lb of tissue cut away from Mr Warren's groin, was filmed for Channel 4's Bodyshock series and will be shown in Britain tomorrow night. Mr Warren could not wear trousers, instead using the arms of a hooded top to cover his legs and zipping the body over his scrotum . Doctors rebuilt his genitals with skin grafts. But Mr Warren was unhappy that he was left with an inch-long penis instead of returning to what he had before his illness. He told the Sun: 'I do feel a great sense of comfort that the weight is no longer between my legs. It got to the point that it was a danger to my health. 'But when I look down at what’s here now it’s not the same as what it was. It’s totally different. 'My natural look prior to the growth is not what came out of surgery. What came out of surgery is a nub an inch long and it doesn’t get any larger.' Mr Warren will have another operation later this year, and said he hopes to be loved again one day when he has recovered from his ordeal.","Wesley Warren Jr, 48, had his swollen scrotum removed two months ago .

Although same-sex marriage is not legal in Kansas, the couple wanted to raise awareness of the issue. The property they married in front of was bought last year by Planting Peace charity founder Aaron Jackson, 31, and in March it was painted with the colors of the pride flag. The little bungalow acts as the perfect counter protest to the Westboro Baptist Church who believe that the United States government is immoral due to its tolerance of homosexuality. The two-bedroom house, which cost $81,000, now sits proudly directly opposite the founding base of the non-affiliated group which describes itself as a 'church'. The guerrilla protest against the Westboro Baptists is particularly fitting given their sporadic demonstrations interrupting the funerals of dead servicemen with their odd anti-gay rhetoric and chants.

Jeremy Forrest's devastated family last night defended their  son against claims that he is a  paedophile and said he is ‘paying for a mistake’. His parents, Jim and Julie, revealed that their son ‘knows he’s been stupid’ but that depression caused him to run away with a 15-year-old pupil. Forrest’s family said he had felt unhappy in his marriage to his  wife Emily and there was ‘a wedge between them’. Support: Julie Forrest, pictured with children Tom and Carrie, said her son Jeremy must accept blame but that 'there were other factors' involved in the abduction of his 15-year-old pupil . The family spoke to The Mail on Sunday at their £800,000 four- bedroom house in Orpington, Kent. At the house, all of Forrest’s  wedding photos have been removed and the belongings from his marital home have been moved to a specially built music studio. Jailed: Teacher Jeremy Forrest is 'paying for a mistake' according to his parents . Retired IT worker Jim, 59, said: ‘One of the worst moments was when we went to pick up Jeremy’s belongings from the house he had lived in with Emily. Emily’s father was there and he told us to leave. ‘It was a shock – but it’s understandable. The two words I have had in my mind throughout all this are dignity and liberty. ‘As parents, there have been tough moments but family is very important to us and we’re behind Jeremy.' 'He has been stupid – obviously  running away with a pupil is not on – but the Jeremy who did that is not  the one I know. ‘He was in a very dark place  then, he was desperate. He is much better now.’ Julie said: ‘I’m not excusing his behaviour, and he has to accept blame, but there were other factors. ‘Emily was difficult for Jeremy to deal with. Jeremy is so giving and Emily enjoyed that as she needed constant reassurance. ‘When Jeremy started working at . another school and things became  difficult, he needed support – but .

Rejected: Mr Justice Underhill threw out the Home Office appeal for Bazomba to be deported citing human rights law . An illegal immigrant who was jailed for beating his children cannot be deported because it would breach his right to a family life. Antonio Alfredo Bazomba, 49, was sentenced to two years in prison for kicking and punching his two sons and a daughter. But an attempt by the Home Office to have him deported following his sentence has been rejected. At an immigration tribunal, a judge ruled he could not be sent back to Angola because it would breach Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights which guarantees a right to family life. Bazomba entered Britain illegally from Angola in 2001 to try and claim asylum. His case was rejected but he was given 'exceptional leave to remain' for another three years. His bid to extend his stay was again rejected but he was also charged with three counts of child cruelty and one of actual bodily harm. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years at Snaresbrook Crown Court. The tribunal rejected the Government's attempts to have him deported even though it said he had 'imposed a cruel regime on his children over four or five years'. The Home Office appealed the decision but their case was thrown out by Mr Justice Underhill. In his ruling he said: 'The children would slapped, kicked, punched and on at least one occasion hit with a wooden ruler. These were not considered acts of corporal punishment but were the result of a loss of temper and control.' But despite describing the violence as 'very serious', the judge ruled he should be allowed to stay in the UK because the relationship has since improved. Excuse: Foreign criminals have frequently used European human rights law to prevent them being deported . The ruling said that Bazomba was a 'changed man' after receiving counselling in jail and then re-established a relationship with his children. But Tory MP Dominic Raab told The Sun: 'It beggars belief that this thug, jailed for abusing his own children, can claim a right to family life. You couldn't get a more perverse illustration of our warped human rights laws.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'Those who come to the UK must abide by our laws. We will take all necessary steps to deport foreign criminals and have introduced tough new rules to protect the public from those who try to stay here through abuse of the Human Rights Act.'The Immigration Bill will contain provisions to give the full force of legislation to these rules and ensure courts properly reflect Parliament's view that serious criminals should be deported unless there are very exceptional circumstances.' The right to a family life has repeatedly been used by foreign criminals to avoid deportation from Britain. Recently an Iraqi drug dealer was allowed to stay after claiming his 'Western' tatoos of naked women would put his life in danger in his home country. Hesham Mohammed Ali, 36, said people with tattoos in Iraq ‘get stoned or harmed’. Judge Jonathan Perkins described the issue as ‘problematic’. Judge Perkins said he was was impressed by evidence from Ali’s British . fiancee, Cy Harwood, 31, who met the criminal in 2005. The judge ruled that Ali’s deportation . would have a damaging effect on her and would be a breach of the . couple’s rights. Ali has his fiancee’s name, surrounded by stars, . tattooed on his hand. His family life was protected despite . the fact he never sees two children he fathered in the UK. He had a . child with an Irish woman and then another son with a woman from . Liverpool, but has no contact with either child, the Upper Tribunal . Immigration and Asylum Chamber was told. Figures released to Parliament show . that 1,230 offenders have overturned their deportation since 2008, . including three child rapists, three murderers, 13 rapists and a . terrorist.

They believed the screaming was a domestic dispute, New Zealand media reported today. The terrified burglar did not wait around for police to arrive at the house.

And despite what you'd imagine, he . believes he has the best job in Britain - hacking out huge ‘fatbergs’ from the clogged waterways. But Rob, who has been in the job for an incredible 20 years, has grown to love his smelly livelihood. He said: 'At the end of the day, someone’s go to do it. Why not take pride in it?' 'I’m very proud to be a sewer man.' To . maintain his social life - and relationship with his wife and family - . he makes sure to shower regularly and ‘avoid people with sensitive . noses’.

His travels through . the ageing Victorian network has seen him come across everything from . half a Mini Cooper to a live hand-grenade. The biggest ‘fatberg’ he has encountered was found near Savoy Gardens. It was the size of a man and took two days to break down. For one week a month he is on call 24-hours a day and if a blockage occurs he must drop everything and enter the sewer. He says the network smells different depending on what time you go in and can sometimes smell ‘nice’. Disgusting: Rob Smith gets kitted up, left, as he prepares to venture into the dank sewers under London .

Despite all the high-tech equipment available, Rob maintains his ultimate safety weapon is his sensitive nose. Dirty work: Rob Smith has performed the vital job of trying to keep London's sewers clear of blockages . Rob, from Little Wakering, Essex, said: 'We have to be very aware of our sense of smell. If I have a cold and I can’t smell then, strictly speaking, I shouldn’t go into a confined space because smell is a key component of keeping yourself safe. 'The monitors will pick up most things but your smell and your hearing tells you the other bits that you need to be 100 per cent safe.' Thames Water is planning to combat the threat of ‘fatbergs’ by taking fat and oils directly from restaurants and build-ups in drains to power Britain’s biggest sewage works. Hard day's work: Rob Smith, 64, emerges from the depth after carrying out what has to be one of the most unpleasant jobs in the country .

People looking for an extra hour in bed can often be left frustrated by noisy early-morning risers. Loud postmen or binmen are often blamed for ruining a lazy lie-in. But when fed-up residents on a Barnsley housing estate decided to complain about noise recently, it was for something altogether different. The South Yorkshire community has been left tired and stressed after being woken at  5.30am by a white robed religious sect praying and chanting in woodland behind their homes. Scroll down for to listen . Loud: Residents on a Barnsley housing estate have complained about the early-morning noise made by a white robed religious sect Friday Apostles . The robed individuals are Learnard Radzokota and his Christian group the Friday Apostles, and they regularly go into the trees to pray and chant at 5.30am. Now some residents of New Lodge estate have written to Yorkshire Housing, Mr Radzokota's landlord, to complain about the disturbance. Mr Radzokota, 54, who lives on the estate, said most people wanted to understand more about the Friday Apostles when they were revealed as the mystery worshippers. But, he added: 'However others just wrote letters to Yorkshire Housing saying because of the praying in the wood, and at our house, we need to be removed from our accommodation.' Early risers: Friday Apostles worshipers led by Learnard Radzokota known as Father Isaiah, far left, pray in woodland behind a Barnsley estate . Mr Radzokota, known as Father Isaiah, said the group didn’t really have a choice but to pray outdoors, because they have no building to worship in. 'As we do not have a permanent place to worship in Barnsley, we sometimes carry our early morning prayers in the wilderness. 'In Africa, all our church members carry out their services in the open space, commonly called wilderness, because by praying in the wilderness we are close to nature and God,' he said. Celia Casham, of Yorkshire Housing, said it firmly supports the right of people to worship in the way they choose. She said: 'However, it was brought to our attention that religious meetings hosted by Mr Radzokota, at his home, had been causing a level of noise which has affected his neighbours at various times of the day. 'We are keen to work with Mr Radzokota and his neighbours to find a compromise which suits both parties. 'We have been trying to help Mr Radzokota find a more suitable venue for his religious meetings such as a local community centre or church hall.'","Residents on Barnsley estate have complained about Friday Apostles .

A man who brutally murdered a retired British Salvation Army officer in Hong Kong by strangling her with a rope has been jailed for life. Major Janet Gilson, 64, was found hidden under a sofa at her niece’s home in Lamma, the third largest island in Hong Kong,  three days after she was reported missing. Ahmed Fareed - believed to be the . ex-husband of Maj Gilson’s niece - was found guilty of her murder and sentenced to life in prison at the city’s high court yesterday. In passing sentence, Mr Justice Michael Stuart-Moore, as reported by the South China Morning Post, said: 'This was a most brutal killing of a woman aged 64 who had done no harm to the defendant. 'I have not doubt he [Fareed] is highly dangerous. 'Words fail to describe the whole horror.' Fareed, who was 29 at the time of the killing, had been barred by a court order . from entering his ex-wife's home before the murder in March 2011. The court heard Maj Gilson - who had retired shortly before her death and lived in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex -  had been . suffocated. She also had a towel stuffed . into her mouth and four of her ribs had been broken. Fareed, from the Maldives, was arrested at Hong Kong’s ferry harbour shortly after the murder. The jury returned a unanimous guilty verdict after a six-day trial. Outside court Maj Gilson’s niece, Julia, told the South China Morning Post: 'To those people that are in relationships with violent partners: I strongly urge you to get away. 'I made the mistake of believing I could help change my ex-husband, giving him many chances.

The child killer regularly makes himself toast and packet soup and nurses turn a blind eye to save him from embarrassment. Brady, 75, looked unexpectedly healthy when he was seen in public last week for the first time in almost 50 years. Legal challenge: Child killer Ian Brady, pictured after his arrest for the murder of five youngsters during 1960s, left, appeared by video link, right, at the mental health tribunal, where he is bidding to be reclassified as sane . Anger: Alan Bennett, whose brother Keith was one of Brady's victims, said the supposed hunger strike was 'farcical' He is appearing before a mental health tribunal where he is pleading to be sent from a secure hospital back to prison. Yesterday his lawyer revealed what his . victims’ families had long suspected – that he has been allowing . himself food for several years. Farcically, nurses turn a blind eye . out of ‘respect’, even knocking before entering his room to save him the . embarrassment of catching him eating. Brady has officially been force-fed . since 1999 after he stopped eating in protest at being moved to a . different ward. He will today make a personal plea to be moved back to . prison so he can starve himself to death. Yesterday, on the sixth day of the . tribunal, the judge questioned why it had taken so long for the sham to . emerge. Alan Bennett, whose brother Keith was one of Brady’s victims but . whose burial site has never been revealed by the killer, said he looked . ‘fit and well which is what I expected after being told many times over . the years that he has never been fitter, despite his farcical supposed . “hunger strike”’. Brady tortured and murdered five children in the 1960s along with accomplice Myra Hindley. Nurse Mark Sheppard gave a vivid . account of Brady’s life on Forster Ward at Ashworth secure hospital, . Merseyside. The hearing is taking place at the hospital, but proceedings . are being relayed to a Manchester courtroom. Moors Murderer Ian Brady, 75, left, appeared via video at his mental health tribunal at Manchester Civil Justice Centre . Mr Sheppard, who has worked with the . killer for two years, said he spent most of his time in his room and . liked hot water brought so he could make packet soups. Brady’s barrister, Nathalie Lieven, . QC, asked him: ‘Mr Brady’s eating, isn’t he?’ Mr Sheppard replied: ‘Ian . does eat other foods as well.’ Miss Lieven went on: ‘He’s not actually . on hunger strike by now, is he?’ Mr Sheppard conceded: ‘What we observe . every day is very, very contradictory of what most people would regard . as a hunger strike.’ Questioned by Judge Robert Atherton, Mr Sheppard . explained: ‘The reality is that we know Ian makes himself toast every . morning. I would say most days we observe Ian eating.’ He added that the killer still . received ‘small amounts’ of food through the nasogastric tube which . could be seen taped to his face as he sat silently through yesterday’s . proceedings. ‘If I observe he’s eating, I knock on the door to give him . the opportunity to put it aside and save him the embarrassment,’ Mr . Sheppard added. Victims: Keith Bennett, whose body has never been recovered, left, and John Kilbride, right, were two of the youngsters killed by Moors murderer Ian Brady during the 1960s . Lured to their deaths: Brady and his partner Myra Hindley killed Edward Evans, left, in October 1965. Pauline Reade, right, 16, disappeared on her . way to a disco on July 12, 1963 . Picture of evil: Myra Hindley, Brady's partner, who was convicted alongside him for the killings. She died in 2002, aged 60, still a prisoner . He said Brady regarded keeping up the . hunger strike as ‘work I have to do’ but at one stage decided to take . weekends off. Nurses do not challenge Brady as the fiction ‘serves some . purpose for Ian’, Mr Sheppard said. ‘It is his continued stance that he is on hunger strike because of his perceived battle with the Home Office,’ he added. Mr Sheppard said it was all part of ‘valuing his individuality and displaying respect’. But he also gave a chilling account of . how Brady ‘bared his teeth’ and ‘grimaced’ in rage as he tried to stab . him in the face with a pen after refusing to take his dose of morphine . for severe back pain. Mr Sheppard said Brady twice came at him with an . uncapped ballpoint last September, which resulted in the prolific . letter-writer being banned from having a pen. The tribunal was also told how . videotapes featuring ‘violent sexually explicit elements’ were found in a . search of his room in 2007. Consultant psychologist David Glasgow, . called by Brady’s legal team, said the killer believed staff . ‘embellished or invented’ such incidents to ‘pathologise his behaviour’ and unsettle him. Mr Glasgow said Brady could be . thoughtful, civil and caring to staff. He said the main risk of sending . him back to jail would be that an inmate would try to kill him, but that . Brady himself had said: ‘As long as it is quick, that is fine by me.’ The hearing continues.

Guilty: Company director James Richardson, pictured, was handed a 20 month suspended sentence for glassing an estate agent in the face . A company director was spared jail despite leaving an international estate agent with permanent scarring after glassing him in the face in a nightclub. James Richardson, 31, launched the vicious and unprovoked attack on 35-year-old Edward Peers during an after-work drink in an exclusive London bar. Mr Peers, a senior sales negotiator at Hamptons, required urgent plastic surgery and 22 stitches to the gash to his face. He was lucky to escape serious damage to his eye, the Old Bailey heard. He was celebrating a friend’s birthday when he got into a petty dispute with Richardson at the bar on King's Road, Chelsea, at around 1.30am on 26 October 2012. Richardson, who runs a family firm providing building maintenance for estate agents, had been drinking for over three hours. Judge Rebecca Poulet QC handed down a 20 month prison term, suspended for two years. But she added that she would have jailed him had it not been for 'exceptional circumstances'. She said: ‘There appears to have been some relatively minor incident that caused antagonism between the two of you. ‘It is difficult to precisely discern what that involved in the light of the amount of drink both of you hand. ‘You were standing near the bar, you had just bought a drink, and had a slim glass tumbler in your hand when Edward Peers raised his arms towards you. ‘You reacted instinctively and quite wrongly and recklessly to push his arm away and strike Edward Peers in the face. The glass shattered around his right eye.’ Mr Peers suffered two cuts to his eyebrow area and a deep cut down the side of his nose. He spent 24 hours in hospital and was treated by a specialist in plastic surgery. During sentencing on Friday, last week, Judge Poulet told Richardson: ‘You narrowly missed his right eye. Happily it did not sustain any injury. ‘It was a blow with a glass and it caused serious permanent scarring to Mr Peers’ face.’ Richardson was arrested at the scene and was heard to say repeatedly: ‘I’m sorry.’ He was charged with wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of malicious wounding in February this year. Spared jail: A judge at the Old Bailey, pictured, that he would have jailed company director James Richardson had it not been for 'exceptional circumstances' The prosecution accepted the plea earlier this month. Judge Poulet told Richardson she would have jailed him for 20 months had it not been for the ""exceptional circumstances"". ‘This was an instinctive single blow. I accept that this offence was out of character. ‘I have observed you in court, listened to your counsel and considered carefully what the writer of the pre-sentence report has said and in all the circumstances I feel that justice will be done if I suspend the sentence. ‘I hope you understand the court has been lenient and it is to be hoped the courts will never see you again.’ Richardson, of Battersea, south London, was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment suspended for two years. He was ordered to pay £2,500 compensation to the victim, £400 towards prosecution costs and a £100 victim surcharge. Richardson will also have to complete a ‘restorative activity requirement’ which could involve him meeting with the victim.","James Richardson, 31, of Battersea, south London, handed a suspended sentence for unprovoked attack .

Jailed: Teacher Jeremy Forrest was attacked in prison because he was accused of having sex with an underage girl, it has been claimed . Convicted paedophile Jeremy Forrest was attacked by a fellow inmate while standing trial for abducting a schoolgirl, it has been claimed. The married teacher, who was jailed for five and a half years last week, appeared in the dock at one point with a black eye. His legal team denied he had been assaulted at the time, but today a police source told the Daily Mirror he was attacked during his time on remand at Lewes Prison in East Sussex by a prisoner who was angry at the nature of his predatory crime. 'Another prisoner took a pop at him because he was accused of having sex with an underage girl,' the source said. Forrest, 30, is currently being kept in the 'vulnerable prisoner' wing amid fears he may harm himself. 'I am told he as been put in isolation for his own protection before he is moved to a Category C jail - he is going to be a marked man now,' the Mirror's source added. Forrest was convicted of abducting a schoolgirl, 15, and fleeing with her to France, and admitted five child sex charges. Yesterday it emerged he plans to marry his victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, when he is released. Forrest’s . sister Carrie Hanspaul, 33, says the maths tutor told his parents during . a prison visit: ‘ I love her and we want to get married.’ Hearing: Jeremy Forrest, 30, appeared at Lewes Crown Court via videolink from HMP Lewes (pictured) On the run: Forrest pictured with the schoolgirl he abducted after they fled to France . The . dramatic twist in the nine-month long saga comes as The Mail on Sunday . revealed for the first time the contents of an emotional letter the pupil . wrote to Forrest’s parents, in which she declares her undying love for . him. Support: Forrest's sister Carrie Hanspaul says his family his behind him and is concentrating on his welfare while in jail . In the five-page note on lilac Laura Ashley notepaper, signed with two kisses, she describes Forrest as ‘wonderful’. The girl, who recently turned 16, sent it as her former teacher at Bishop Bell School in Eastbourne awaited trial. The girl apologised ‘for any upset I have caused’ and said she felt safer while on the run in France with Forrest last September than at home or school. Mrs Hanspaul said: ‘If they’re going to carry on and be in a relationship, we would welcome her into our family and offer any support she was to ask for. We are concentrating on getting him through this.' She also added that the victim has been given permission to visit Forrest in jail. 'The girl’s planning on doing that as soon as she can,' said Mrs Hanspaul.  'Jeremy told me that he’d been told that she wanted to visit. ‘In court on the day of his conviction, he said to me, ‘‘Tell her she’s allowed to visit,’’ and when I did she just smiled.’ The father of the schoolgirl victim has said that he approves of their plan to marry and that he would happily walk his 16-year-old down the aisle. As the teenager publicly declared her love for her jailed former teacher, her biological father said he supports their relationship and even wants to thank Forrest for what he did. Despite his confession of having under-age sex with his daughter – and running away with her to France when she was 15 years old - the victim’s father said he wants to shake Forrest’s hand. ‘I’d like to visit him in prison and, shake his hand, and say, “Thanks for looking after my daughter”,’ he told The Sun.","Teacher given black eye by angry inmate in Lewes Prison, source claims .

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 08:32 EST, 24 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:19 EST, 24 June 2013 . The Met commissioner in post when Stephen Lawrence was murdered said today he never 'authorised or condoned' any smear operation against the teenager's family. Ex-Scotland Yard chief Lord Condon said he was 'shocked and dismayed' at the allegations made by a former undercover officer. Peter Francis, who reportedly posed as an anti-racist activist in the . mid-1990s, claims he came under 'huge and constant pressure' to 'hunt for . disinformation' to undermine those arguing for a better investigation . into the racist murder. David Cameron has demanded an inquiry to 'get the full truth out' about the 'horrific' allegations that police tried to sully the family of Stephen Lawrence. Denial: Former Met Commissioner Sir Paul Condon's time at Scotland Yard was dominated by the murder of Stephen Lawrence, and he said today he never 'authorised or condoned' a bid to smear Stephen's family . Anger: David Cameron with Doreen Lawrence, mother of Stephen, as the Prime Minister demanded an inquiry by Scotland Yard into whether police were trying to undermine the family . This afternoon the Home Secretary . announced Scotland Yard had called in the Independent Police Complaints . Commission (IPCC) to consider whether undercover officers had worked to . undermine the Lawrences. Mrs May told MPs that the claims would be considered by Operation Herne, the inquiry into the undercover operations of the Special Demonstration Squad - a covert unit set up to combat protests against the Vietnam war in 1968 and funded by the Home Office -  in London in the 1980s and 1990s. It is being led by Derbyshire Chief Constable Mick Creedon under the oversight of the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The allegations will also fall under the review of alleged police corruption in the original Lawrence inquiry being conducted by Mark Ellison QC. The Home Secretary said she would be 'ruthless' in purging the Metropolitan Police of any misconduct and made clear that prosecutions could follow the conclusion of the inquiries. But she resisted calls to hand the investigation into undercover policing over to the IPCC, telling MPs that chairman Anne Owers did not believe this would 'enhance the investigation'. Worried: The Prime Minister said today that Scotland Yard must investigate the damaging claims . Neville Lawrence, the father of the murdered teenager, said he was 'dismayed' at the spying disclosures and called for a judge-led inquiry into the latest allegations. Mr Lawrence, in a statement issued by his solicitors Hodge Jones & Allen, said: 'I am dismayed about the new information that has come to light as a result of the Dispatches investigation. I've always felt that my family was under greater investigation than those guilty of killing my beloved Stephen. 'It is unthinkable that in the extremely dark days and months after my son's murder that my family were subject to such scrutiny. 'I've worked with the police since Stephen's death in good faith to bring the perpetrators to justice and help the police learn the lessons set out in the Macpherson report. I feel betrayed by this latest news and it has taken away the faith I had started to build in the police. 'I understand that the Home Secretary has announced that she will extend the inquiries of Mark Ellison QC and Operation Herne, I would like to make it clear that I find this completely unsatisfactory. 'I am convinced that nothing short of a judge-led public inquiry will suffice and I have no confidence that the measures announced today will get to the bottom of this matter.' Mr Francis joins a number of whistle blowers who infiltrated protest groups for the Met Police . Lord Condon's time at the head of the . force was dominated by the Lawrence case and the subsequent Macpherson . Report, which found the force to be 'institutionally racist'. Damagingly Mr Francis also claims he was also asked to target the friend who witnessed the . murder and campaigners angry at the failure to bring his killers to . justice. Francis . also said how undercover officers were visited at a Marylebone safe . house by Lord Condon, who gave each officer a bottle of whisky to thank . them for their undercover work. Lord Condon says he had 'no recollection' about the alleged visit but admits he may have met Francis. Scotland Yard says it is 'not prepared to confirm or deny' the truth of the claims, which surfaced as a result of a joint investigation into undercover policing by the Guardian and Channel 4's Dispatches programme, to be broadcast tonight. In a statement, Lord Condon said such actions - and the keeping of them . from the Macpherson Inquiry into the case which found the Met guilty of . institutional racism - would be 'clearly wrong'. 'I am shocked and dismayed by the allegations made by the former undercover police officer Peter Francis,' he said. 'I am aware how distressing these allegations must be for Mr and Mrs . Lawrence, and I am anxious they should know the truth as soon as . possible. 'Throughout the time I was Commissioner I was never aware of, nor did I . authorise or condone any police officers being tasked to smear Mr and . Mrs Lawrence in the way suggested by Peter Francis. 'I am anxious that the truth of these allegations should be established . as soon as possible and I will do all in my power to help that process'. Pete Francis monitored a number of 'black justice' campaigns, involving relatives of mostly black men who had died in suspicious circumstances in police custody . Spy: Peter Francis said he was asked by senior officers in the Met Police to find information to smear the family of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence . Two investigations are already under way - one led by the chief constable of Derbyshire into undercover policing and the other a QC-led review of the Metropolitan Police's own inquiry into allegations of corruption in the original Lawrence investigation. Speaking at 10 Downing Street, Mr Cameron said: 'Let's be clear, these are absolutely dreadful allegations and we can only think of the Lawrence family, who have suffered so much already from the loss of their son. Family: Stephen Lawrence's mother Doreen and ex-husband Neville, Stephen's father . 'To hear that, potentially, the police that were meant to be helping them were actually undermining them - that's horrific. 'We have investigations under way. The Home Secretary will be making a statement to the House of Commons. 'We must make sure those investigations get rapidly to the bottom of what's happened and we get the full truth out.' Asked whether he was concerned that lower ranking officers may have been acting on their own initiative, after former Met commissioner Lord Condon said he was not aware of any order to target the Lawrences, Mr Cameron said: 'This is worrying and that is why two investigations, one of them being led by the chief constable of another police force, are under way. 'The Home Secretary has acted swiftly to make sure that these investigations cover all of the potential allegations and we get to the bottom of this as rapidly as possible.' Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he was 'personally shocked' by Mr Francis's claims. He said: 'If these allegations are true, it's a disgrace, and the Metropolitan Police Service will apologise.' 'Smearing the family of a murder victim would never be acceptable to me or my officers.' Stephen Lawrence was an aspiring architect who was stabbed to death by a group of up to six white youths in an unprovoked racist attack as he waited at a bus stop in Eltham, south east London. In January 2012 Gary Dobson and David Norris were found guilty of being involved in the attack and sentenced to life imprisonment, after a forensic review of the case found significant new scientific evidence on clothing seized from their homes following the murder. MP Keith Vaz said a public inquiry is necessary to probe the police's use of undercover agents . London Mayor Boris Johnson condemned as 'utterly disgraceful' the . activities described by Mr Francis, who says he was told to dig up . 'dirt' shortly after the 18-year-old was killed in a racist attack in . April 1993. 'I think it . is utterly disgraceful that the Metropolitan Police Service were . engaged in this kind of activity whether it is surveillance or trying to . discredit the campaign to vindicate the memory of Stephen Lawrence,' he . said. 'It is very important that the family of . Stephen Lawrence get answers to what I think is an absolutely . deplorable series of allegations as soon as possible.' Anger: Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said: 'If these allegations are true, it's a disgrace' Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the time has come to look seriously at a public inquiry into the police's use of undercover agents. The Labour MP, addressing Mrs May said: 'When the select committee published our report on March 1 into undercover police officers, we expressed deep concern that Operation Herne had taken 20 months, cost £1.2 million, involved 23 officers but nobody had been arrested. 'Chief Constable Creedon is a full-time serving chief constable. 'Frankly with 50,000 documents to look through it's going to take them years to resolve this matter. 'We do need a timetable. What words of comfort do you have for the families whose dead children's identities have been used by undercover agents?' Mrs May said Chief Constable Creedon expects to respond to the issue of undercover officers using dead children's identities before the Commons rises for the summer recess. A Met Police spokesman said: 'The claims in relation to Stephen Lawrence's family will bring particular upset to them and we share their concerns.' He added: 'The Met must balance the genuine public interest in these matters with its duty to protect officers and former officers who have been deployed undercover, often in difficult and dangerous circumstances. 'We are therefore not prepared to confirm nor deny the identity of individuals alleged in the media to have been working undercover, nor confirm nor deny the deployment of individuals on specific operations.'","Lord Condon says he's 'shocked and dismayed' by allegations about smears .

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Sunday urged fast-growing India to work with the United States on global warming before it's too late. 'The irreversible climate challenge is speeding towards us, crying out for a global solution,' he said. Kerry spoke on climate change in a speech in New Delhi, the second stop on his two-week swing through the Mideast and Asia, just two days before President Barack Obama is to unveil his long-awaited plan for the United States on the issue. 'The world's largest democracy and its oldest one must do more together, uniting not as a threat to anyone, not as a counterweight to a region or some other countries, but as partners building a strong, smart future in a critical age,' Kerry said in a reference to how India is often viewed as a counterbalance to China. Let's make a deal: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called on the U.S. and India to tackle global warming during a Sunday speech in New Delhi, India . People consulting with White House officials on Obama's plan say they expect the president to put forth regulations on heat-trapping gases emitted by coal-fired power plants that are already running. Environmental groups have been pleading with Obama to take that step, but the administration has said it's focused first on controls on new power plants. More than half of India's power comes from coal and while the U.S. has emission issues of its own, it wants to see India and other nations in the region rely less on old, coal generation facilities. The U.S. is backing a Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline that would bring energy to a power-starved region. Speaking at a convention center to a crowd of several hundred businessmen, students and others, Kerry noted that federal scientists in May reported that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere passed 400 parts per million - a level never before experienced by man. ""When the desert is creeping into East Africa, and ever more scarce resources push farmers and herders into deadly conflict ... then this is a matter of shared security for all of us. ... When the Himalayan glaciers are receding, threatening the very supply of water to almost a billion people, we all need to do better,"" he said. During his first trip to India as secretary of state, the top U.S. diplomat was expected to discuss a myriad of other topics, including enhancing security in the region and prospects for finding a political resolution to the war in Afghanistan. Flooded: Kerry's speech came as the Indian countryside was ravaged by severe flooding. More intense weather is believed to be caused by global warming . As NATO troops leave, India fears the country could fall into the hands of a Taliban-led regime, endangering many of India's interests there. Kerry reassured India, which has invested more than $2 billion to reconstruct Afghanistan, that the U.S. commitment to the Afghan people will not end at the close of next year when NATO-led combat troops complete their withdrawal. In meetings before Kerry heads to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, the U.S. expects Indian officials will want to query Kerry about prospects for peace talks with the Taliban. U.S. talks were scheduled to begin in coming days, but a last-minute diplomatic rift over how the Taliban rolled out their new political office in Doha, Qatar, has threatened to scuttle the talks. ""Obviously, we are very realistic about the difficulties of making progress. Making peace is never easy, and a final settlement may be long in coming,"" he said. ""And let me be clear: Any political settlement must result in the Taliban breaking ties with al-Qaida, renouncing violence and accepting the Afghan constitution, including its protections for all Afghans, women and men. Afghanistan cannot again become a safe haven for international terrorism."" Kerry also spoke about India's archrival, Pakistan. There is widespread hope that Pakistan's new President Nawaz Sharif will try to improve relations with its Indian neighbor, thus reducing the chance of a fourth major war between the nuclear-armed foes. But India has been frustrated by Pakistan's failure to crack down on Islamic extremists, which have strong historical links with Pakistani intelligence. Kerry called on Pakistan to continue normalizing trade relations with Pakistan. ""Just last year, bilateral trade increased 21 percent,"" he said. Washington wants New Delhi to speed up economic reform to increase U.S. business and trade opportunities with India. In the past decade, bilateral trade has increased five-fold, but Kerry is expected to share the concerns of the U.S. business community about trade and about other problems American businessmen are facing in India. More than 150 U.S. lawmakers teamed up with American business groups last week to press the Obama administration to further press India to ease policies they claim are bad for American exports, jobs and innovation.","Called for the two nations to work together on global warming during Sunday speech in New Delhi, India .

Defence firms have been caught trying to charge the taxpayer hundreds of thousands of pounds for Christmas parties, magicians and even ‘anticipated car accidents’. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has uncovered a string of startling claims submitted as part of multi-million-pound defence contracts. He said firms had got away with billing the Ministry of Defence for ‘inappropriate activities’ because they did not have to provide a breakdown of what their charges were for. Looking for savings: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, left, and Chancellor George Osborne, right, have agreed a deal over the weekend to cut down on profligacy in MoD spending . Such profligacy, however, will be squeezed under a spending deal agreed between Mr Hammond and Chancellor George Osborne over the weekend. A review ordered by Mr Hammond  has revealed extraordinary examples of ‘expenses’ which firms attempted to charge to the taxpayer, but have now been rejected. They included £16,500 for ‘depreciation costs for executive flats’ and £25,000 for ‘cake, flowers and catering for a commissioning ceremony’. Other examples included £9,500 for ‘staff team building’, £650 for ‘2 x magicians’, £24,000 for ‘mugs for a launch ceremony’, £200 for ‘attending Christmas party’, and £8,000 for non-specified ‘entertainment’. Perhaps the most bizarre attempted charge under a defence contract was £50,000 for ‘anticipated car accidents (two a week at £500)’.  Defence sources said that it appeared many such claims were waved through without proper checks under the last government. Meanwhile, the Chancellor said yesterday he had reached agreement with Mr Hammond over the MoD budget for 2015-16 as part of the Coalition’s spending review, to be unveiled on Wednesday. There will be up to 2,000 further job losses among civilian personnel working for the ministry, but front-line servicemen will be protected from further cuts. Mr Hammond is also proposing a new independent watchdog to ensure that the taxpayer receives value for money from lucrative defence contracts which are currently not put out to tender. A system dating back more than four decades allows UK companies to bid for some military contracts without competition, on the grounds that they are sensitive to national security. Mr Hammond said: ‘It’s vital that we get value for taxpayers’ money in times of increasing financial pressures  … Increased transparency on single-source contracts will help ensure tight resources are being spent properly while still allowing industry fair profits.’ Mr Osborne told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that he had now finalised a settlement with the MoD over its spending plans for 2015-16 after months of semi-public wrangling. The deal will mean between 1,000 and 2,000 further job losses – but no further reductions in military manpower. Furthermore, around £250million in fines from banks guilty of rate-rigging will be used over the next 25 years to support troops and veterans.","Philip Hammond said firms were billing the MoD for ‘inappropriate activities’

Meanwhile, in Stillwater, Minnesota, neighbourhoods were covered in almost a foot of snow after an early May snowfall. People swim and sunbathe at Goose Lake in Anchorage, Alaska. Alaska's largest city and other parts of the state are experiencing a long stretch of higher than normal temperatures thanks to the jet stream 'wreaking havoc' across the U.S. Seattle was the hottest spot in the nation one day, and Maine and Edmonton, Canada were warmer than Miami and Phoenix. Jet streams are belts of fast flowing, narrow air currents found in the . atmosphere, formed near air masses with significantly different . temperatures. They are responsible for moving weather around the latitudes. The northern hemisphere polar jet flows over the middle to northern latitudes of North America, Europe, and Asia. The southern hemisphere polar jet mostly circles Antarctica all year round. One of the main factors in unsettled weather is a change in the position of the jet stream, which can cause massive changes in weather conditions across the globe. The meandering jet stream path has been attributed to arctic ice loss. The warming of the Arctic affects the jet . stream by slowing its west-to-east winds and by promoting larger . north-south meanders in the flow. The most recent example is mid-June where some towns in Alaska hit record highs. Jet streams are belts of fast . flowing, narrow air currents found in the atmosphere, formed near air . masses with significantly different temperatures. They are responsible for moving weather around the latitudes. The Polar jet stream, which is the . most northerly jet stream, affects the UK, and tends to be further south . in the winter and further north in the summer. Recently, the jet stream has been further south - which is why the UK has experienced such wet summers. In America the meandering jet stream path has been attributed to arctic ice loss. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) explained: 'Enhanced warming of the Arctic affects the jet stream by slowing its west-to-east winds and by promoting larger north-south meanders in the flow. 'Predicting those meanders and where the weather associated with them will be located in any given year, however, remains a challenge.' They researchers claim that there will be more extreme weather events, such as heavy snowfall, heat waves, and flooding in North America and Europe but these will vary in location, intensity, and timescales.","Jet stream is river of air high above Earth .

Radio Times staff had been moved there from central London when the Second World War began - and the plant became a strategically-important target as part of the war on propaganda. The map - showing the plant which also printed fellow BBC magazine The Listener - was found by U.S. air force intelligence officer Captain Andrew Wilson at the Fritzlar airbase in Germany in 1944.

Counter-terrorism detectives are now investigating after a home-made bomb exploded near a mosque in a hate crime attack. The device exploded on Friday evening after residents in the Caldmore area of Walsall heard a loud bang similar to a firework. The following morning the remains of the bomb were found . by a local man in an alleyway adjoining the Aisha Mosque and Islamic Centre in Rutter . Street. Unaware of what the item was, he took it home and showed it to . his wife. Probe: Counter-terrorism detectives have been called in to help after a home-made bomb exploded near a mosque in a hate crime attack . Concern: Around 150 people were evacuated from their homes in the Caldmore area of Walsall on Saturday night while bomb disposal experts made the device safe. Forensic officers are pictured searching the area around the mosque . The mosque’s imam also later took the device's remains home before anyone realised their significance and contacted the police. Around 150 people were evacuated from their homes on Saturday night while bomb disposal experts made the device safe. Sharon Rowe, assistant Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, said last night: 'The force is taking this attack against the mosque very seriously and we have a major investigation under way. 'To that end, I have called in support from all over the force, including the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, which has a number of experts supporting the inquiry. 'Specialist investigators have been working all day and continue to ensure that we maximise every opportunity from the crime scene.' She added: 'At this stage we are keeping an open mind on a motive, but have recorded it as a hate crime. Worrying: A loud bang was heard by residents late on Friday 'appeared to be consistent' with the device exploding . Police have stepped up patrols in Walsall to reassure the community, despite believing the planting of the device was an isolated incident. While the motive for the crime is yet to be established, Sharon Rowe described the incident as 'despicable'. Zia Ul-Haq, a committee member and spokesman for the mosque, told BBC WM the device was handed in on Saturday evening, and committee members called police at about 10.15pm because it looked suspicious. He said: 'The package was found along the front boundary wall, on the corner of the building. It was found by one of our worshippers who after midday prayer was going home, and he had a look and it looked suspicious, so he picked it up and took it home. Investigation: Police near the mosque in Walsall after the discovery of a suspicious item . 'He showed it his wife and his wife said, ""Well, it looks like something suspicious so you should take it to the mosque"". So he brought it to the mosque but unfortunately there was nobody responsible in the mosque so he took it back home. 'Then he brought it back in the evening and then our imam had a look at it, and he took it home because nobody thought it was that serious.' Eventually, several people, including members of the committee, got together at the mosque and decided to call police after assessing the item, which was reported to contain a battery. 'I said it looks suspicious and we decided to call the police. As soon as the police came they said we should not have handled it.' Mr Ul-Haq thanked the police and the local council for their support following the discovery. He said: 'They have taken this very seriously and they have supported us wholeheartedly and we are very grateful to the police and the local authority. 'We are not suspecting anybody, we are leaving it in the good hands of the police. We have beautiful relationships with the local community and we’ve never had any trouble at all at our mosque.' Mr Ul-Haq told the BBC that the mosque had been in existence for more than 40 years and had very good relations with communities of all faiths, holding open days for non-Muslims. 'We never ever thought there was going to be a problem and people are still finding it hard that somebody could have targeted us.' Bomb disposal experts from the Royal Logistic Corps attended the scene to ensure the device was safe and forensic teams spent several hours conducting a detailed search for evidence. About 80 people evacuated from the area as a precautionary measure overnight were given shelter by Walsall Council, while 70 residents stayed with friends or family. West Midlands Police said that almost 72 hours after the device exploded, officers from across the force continue to trawl CCTV and speak to witnesses. Valerie Vaz, MP for Walsall South, said: 'This could potentially have been a very serious incident and I am pleased that nobody was hurt. 'Residents were shocked but settled when I spoke to them. They were understandably upset that their lives should be disrupted. 'I note that West Midlands Police are treating this incident as a hate crime. Given that investigations are at such an early stage we should not speculate further about the motives for this incident.' Her comments were echoed by Walsall mayor and assistant police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands, councillor Mohammad Nazir. He said: 'If this proves to be an attack on a place of worship, then it is an attack on everyone - whatever their beliefs.' Location: This map shows the location of the mosque within Walsall . Councillor Zahid Ali, portfolio holder for public health and protection, said: 'We stand shoulder to shoulder together as a community in support of the police. 'We’ve worked very hard with the community and shown that we were there for them when the evacuated residents needed shelter. 'Walsall has really shown its mettle in coming together and responding with calm determination.' It comes after a number of recent incidents at mosques following the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich, London. Last week two men were charged in relation to an alleged arson at a mosque in Gloucester, and an Islamic cultural centre in Grimsby was hit by petrol bombs last month. Mosques in Braintree, Essex, and Gillingham, Kent, have also been targeted. Anyone concerned by the events or with information which may aid the investigation should call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.","Device exploded outside Aisha Mosque and Islamic Centre in Walsall .

A 103-year-old woman has been hailed as the world’s longest serving girl guide at a special party to celebrate her service to the group. Dorothy Procter, who now serves with the Trefoil Guides, has been named as one of the world’s oldest girl guides after joining the group in the 1920s. Dorothy was born in Bootle, Merseyside, in 1910 and joined the girl guides at the age of 14 before travelling across the globe and making a career as a police shorthand typist. Long-time girl guide: Dorothy Procter is the oldest girl guide in Wirral and celebrated her 103rd birthday last week . Former typist Dorothy, who took her advanced driving test aged 89, has now had to give up driving due to failing eyesight, but keeps up her duties with the guides. She now passes her spare time playing scrabble and going to see live classical music as well as attending monthly meetings with the Guides. Dorothy, of Heswall, Wirral said: 'The Guides is more of a way of life than an activity for me. I’d never turn my back on them, it’s a wonderful service for young girls. 'Once a Guide, always a Guide. It’s a funny story how I got involved with them. My friend knew a lot about flags and one day she said that the Town Hall’s flag was the wrong way around. 'When I asked her how she knew she said ""if you were in the Guides you would know"" and that’s when I joined. 'Even though I am getting on a bit, I attend the meetings every month. Dedicated: Dorothy joined the girl guides aged 14 and still attends monthly meetings with the Trefoil Guides . 'It’s very important to me and we get a bite to eat and have a sing along, which is always nice.' Dorothy attributes her longevity to keeping fit by walking and cycling, she also believes that people must be mentally strong. She said: 'I have always done a lot of walking and cycling and that is how I’ve managed to stay active all these years. 'Longevity is also down to having good genes to start with, but you also have to be very tough. 'I used to cycle to Yorkshire and Scotland, back when there were no sign posts. Back in the day: Dorothy, far left, in an old girl guide photograph. She attributes her longevity to keeping fit by walking and cycling, while also saying people must be mentally strong . 'I remember years ago when a woman asked me if I could swim and I said no, so she just threw me into the pool. 'Then she asked me again if I could swim, so I said yes and that’s how I learned. 'I have been very lucky health wise in my life. I’ve got trouble with my legs but I stay tough mentally, so I get by.' Dorothy’s 103rd birthday party was arranged by friends and family, who used the landmark occasion to celebrate her time as a Girl Guide. Physical: Picture shows Dorothy Procter climbing Snowdon when she was younger. The things she has done during her time as a guide are just inspirational so she has been asked to open the guide's 100 year exhibition . Sue Dutton, County Commissioner for the Girl Guides, met Dorothy three years ago and described her as ‘a remarkable woman.’ She said: 'When we heard about Dorothy’s history with the guides, we visited her and she took out photographs of her time with the guild and it was just amazing. 'The things she has done during her time as a guide are just inspirational so we asked her to open our 100 year exhibition and she agreed. 'We were really blown away when we first went to meet her. 'She told us all about her time as a guide and she was the life and soul of our opening party at Port Sunlight. She is a remarkable woman.'

"By . Chris Greenwood, James Chapman And Claire Ellcott . PUBLISHED: . 18:26 EST, 23 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:33 EST, 23 June 2013 . Secret evidence implicating leading law and insurance firms in phone hacking, surveillance and data theft is to be probed by MPs. A report submitted to the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards suggests hackers and private investigators are routinely paid to dig for information on companies and individuals. Among the practices revealed by the confidential – and now leaked – Serious Organised Crime Agency report were live telephone interceptions, computer hacking, police corruption and obtaining itemised phone bills. A report submitted to the Leveson Inquiry suggests that 80 per cent of phone hacking was not done by journalists . Last night Keith Vaz, who chairs the Commons home affairs select committee, said he suspected the evidence was withheld from Parliament during a previous probe into private investigators. The Labour MP now plans to recall ‘relevant witnesses’. But Lord Justice Leveson is also facing questions as to why he failed to highlight in his inquiry the allegations of misbehaviour by businesses other than the media. He was apparently told that law firms, insurance companies, wealthy individuals and even local councils were paying investigators for sensitive information. The report dates back to 2008 but does not feature in the 1,987-page findings of the Leveson Inquiry, which was triggered by phone hacking at the now defunct News of the World. One hacker has said 80 per cent of his client list comprised blue-chip companies and high-profile individuals, with the rest related to the media. Keith Vaz, who chairs the Commons home affairs select committee, said he suspected the evidence was withheld from Parliament during a previous probe into private investigators . Among those said to have benefitted from such practices was law firm Mishcon de Reya, which employed a private detective agency that outsourced work to criminals. Other clients are thought to include a big telecoms firm, a celebrity broadcaster and a businessman involved in a multi-million pound takeover. Mr Vaz said: ‘When the committee conducted its inquiry we asked for all the relevant information from Soca. It appears that all these documents were not provided. I will be putting this on the committee’s agenda for Tuesday and asking members if we should recall the relevant witnesses.’ John Whittingdale, who chairs the Commons culture, media and sport committee, which investigated phone hacking, said: ‘The Leveson Inquiry was set up specifically to look at the Press, but if it was presented with evidence that there was illegal activity taking place elsewhere it seems pretty extraordinary that it did not flag this up. ‘But a bigger question is if Soca had uncovered evidence of widespread criminality or questionable practice, why were they reporting it to the Leveson Inquiry and not investigating and prosecuting people?’ Nicola Blackwood, a Tory member of the home affairs select committee, said: ‘It was clear from our inquiry into private investigators that under-regulation meant that hacking and other criminal practices were far from confined to the media. ‘If Soca has had evidence of specific offences since 2008, we need to know exactly what they have been doing about it since then. Who else knew about this? And how did they justify the total exclusion of this evidence from the Leveson report?’ The confidential Soca report, leaked at the weekend, highlighted how some of the country’s most respected industries are deeply embroiled in the trade in secret information. Conservative MP John Whittingdale (left) and Nicola Blackwood MP (right) have both commented on the revelations . Local authorities were even paying for information about people who owed money for council tax, rent and parking fines. Investigators said that in one case, a technical expert had created a bugging device which could be physically attached to landlines at the nearest signal box by a BT-trained engineer. They found the industry giving most business to criminal private detectives was City law firms and insurers. Many of them were involved in divorce or family proceedings or suspicious high-value insurance claims. Yet, Soca, which attempted to dub itself as ‘Britain’s FBI’ but will soon be replaced by a new National Crime Agency, apparently did nothing to halt the thriving unlawful business. The document – codenamed Project Riverside – was privately supplied to the Leveson inquiry last year. But the judge’s final report simply made a passing reference,  acknowledging that buyers of personal data ‘included the media, insurance companies, lenders and creditors, parties involved in family disputes, criminals with what are likely to have been criminal or malicious intentions, including witness and juror intimidation, and estranged couples seeking details of their partner’s whereabouts’. Arnold & Porter was, with Mishcon de Reya, one of the firms said to have used information supplied by crooked private investigators. The BBC could not find space in its radio or TV bulletins yesterday for the extraordinary revelations about blue chip hacking. Neither was the national broadcaster able to add a story to the website it has dedicated to the inquiry into media standards. The Independent newspaper reported the existence of the leaked Serious Organised Crime Agency document on Saturday. Claims that Lord Justice Leveson turned a blind eye to wrongdoing by his fellow lawyers as well as insurers and local councils caused a considerable stir online. The Independent front page was followed up by several media outlets including the Sunday Times and The Sun on Sunday. But during this 48-hour window the closest the BBC came to reporting the story was a short mention on a newspaper review. The lacklustre response contrasts sharply with the wall-to-wall coverage the BBC gave to the Leveson Inquiry itself. The corporation reported almost every single development of the inquiry during eight months of hearings that lambasted the mainstream media. It offers readers the chance to ‘relive the inquiry’ week by week on a website. They employed a detective agency to obtain personal information, including the finances of a failed business tycoon. The agency – Surrey-based Carratu – then subcontracted the work to husband and wife team Sharon and Stephen Anderson, trading as Analysis & Business Research. The duo earned up to £140,000 a year by obtaining banking details, income tax information and ex-directory telephone numbers from their Cambridgeshire home. They were convicted of 55 offences under the Data Protection Act at Huntingdon Magistrates’ Court in November 2006. Mishcon, Arnold & Porter and Carratu all denied knowing the Andersons were acting unlawfully. Mishcon de Reya, which acted for the Princess of Wales in her divorce, cut its ties with Carratu after the case emerged in 2006. A Soca spokesman said: ‘Soca produced a confidential report in 2008 on the issue of licensing the private investigation industry. ‘This report remains confidential and Soca does not comment on leaked documents or specific criminal investigations. Information is shared with other partners as required.’ The trade for personal and company data is driven by officials locked in legal disputes and those hunting missing debtors. They deny offences were carried out with their knowledge, claiming they thought the sensitive information was obtained legitimately. But those procuring the information are often acting illegally. In many cases they are breaking several laws and risking jail. In some cases private investigators openly admit this, and use the risk to justify their often extortionate fees. The most serious offence was the one most routinely committed by blaggers and hackers: conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. Carrying a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, this would apply to anyone who knowingly obtains secret information from official databases. Lord Justice Leveson kept silent last . night as his inquiry was hit by yet another controversy. His staff said . the row over hacking, blagging and information theft was nothing to do . with his report on Press standards. They accused critics of . ‘misunderstanding’ the remit of the £5.5million inquiry ordered by David . Cameron. But the Court of Appeal judge may be forced to defend his . actions if summoned by a parliamentary inquiry. MPs want Lord Leveson to explain why he apparently disregarded the torrent of evidence pointing to widespread wrongdoing. His inquiry has already suffered a . series of setbacks since it was published last November. Critics . highlighted a series of mistakes and discovered several parts were cut . and pasted from the internet. Most embarrassingly it emerged that a . counsel for the inquiry was having a secret affair with the barrister . for one of the media’s leading critics. In the most serious and worrying cases it would apply to police officers. But it could also include trusted staff at organisations that hold huge amounts of information such as the DVLA, Revenue and Customs or the NHS. It has become the charge of choice in cases against journalists and civil servants. Anyone undertaking illicit ex-directory checks or identifying records of family and friends would breach section 55 of the Data Protection Act. Other offences might include using a telephone number or number plate to obtain a home address or bank statement. Most personal information crooks brought to court are dealt with by magistrates who have the power only to hand out a maximum fine of £5,000. Those caught often see this punishment as derisory.","Report suggests that private investigators are often paid to hack phones .

"By . Will Stewart In Moscow . PUBLISHED: . 18:54 EST, 23 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:45 EST, 23 June 2013 . Resigned: Lebedev said he expects to be sent to prison in July but hope his sentence is less than two years . Both sides in newspaper owner Alexander Lebedev’s controversial trial in Moscow expect him to be found guilty, with the media tycoon hoping his sentence will be less than two years, it was revealed yesterday. But in a surprise statement, his foe Sergei Polonsky’s glamorous lawyer predicted Lebedev will be convicted - but avoid prison. The farcical court case is over two 'punches' thrown by Lebedev after he was 'provoked' during a TV debate on the Russian economy. The tycoon faces the sledgehammer charge of hooliganism motivated by 'political hatred' which carries a maximum penalty of five years in jail. Ex-KGB spy Lebedev - who owns The Independent titles and the London Evening Standard - admitted at the weekend that he is 'steeling' himself for jail in a case that some analysts see as a move by the Kremlin to crush his investigative Russian newspaper. Others see the legal action against him as a bid by corrupt officials to destroy his business empire and grab his assets. 'Anyone can see that I’m innocent but obviously I have to prepare myself for jail,' said Lebedev, 53. 'What I’m hoping for is a sentence of less than two years. To put it mildly, it’s unpleasant, but I’m mentally steeling myself. I’m not scared. I won’t flee.' But fugitive Polonsky’s lawyer Diana Tatosova said: 'I am more than 99.9 per cent sure we will win the trial and he will be found guilty. But most likely he will not go to jail.' At the weekend, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, 82, issued a statement to the Mail on Sunday denouncing the prosecution and declaring: 'It was no more than a minor incident that does not even deserve a court hearing.' A verdict in the case - which resumes in Moscow today - is  expected by early July. In a move which raises huge doubts that justice will be done, the judge is refusing to call 'star witness' Polonsky, 40, to give evidence and face cross examination at the trial on the basis that he is on bail in Cambodia facing a police probe into allegations he kidnapped and threatened a group of local sailors. This is despite photographic evidence that Polonsky is instead in a bolthole in Tel Aviv where Tatosova admits she is seeking to obtain Israeli citizenship for her property mogul client. Charges: Lebedev faces up to five years in prison for hooliganism motivated by 'political hatred' after he threw 'two punches' at Sergei Polonsky in TV debate . Backing: Lebedev, left, has received the support of former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev (pictured together at the Evening Standard) The judge did, however, accept prosecution testimony from a woman who watched the show on TV and was randomly recruited by lawyers after stepping off a bus in central Moscow. Outside court: Alexander Lebedev's wife Elena Perminova waits anxiously as his trial continues in Moscow. The couple have two young sons . Tatosova revealed she has filed requests to archives in Russia, Latvia and Azerbaijan in a bid to prove Polonsky has Jewish blood. Polonsky is separately wanted in Russia on a £121 million charge for fraud and embezzlement over an alleged scam of buyers of a planned elite residential development called ‘Kutuzovskaya Mile’. Russians who claim to have been hoodwinked by Polonsky yesterday wrote to the Israeli government calling for his passport bid to be blocked. 'Everyone in Russia and the world will think that Israeli citizenship can be bought for money made in an illegal way,' states their letter. 'Swindlers can do anything and you will not only fail to punish but will even encourage their conduct. As a result, the reputation of the Israeli State will sustain significant damage, and Polonsky will be a shame to Israel, after he has already become a shame in Russia.' Tatosova, 31, also claimed Polonsky’s life could be threatened by returning to Russia. Lebedev has alleged a relationship between Polonsky and the lawyer who helped negotiate his release from detention in Cambodia in April. She denied this, hitting back by posting a semi-nude picture of Lebedev’s wife, Siberian-born model Elena Perminova.","Alexander Lebedev's legal team expect him to be jailed for punches thrown during a TV debate .

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 18:10 EST, 23 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:44 EST, 24 June 2013 . Two of the most powerful figures in the NHS are facing calls to resign over their roles in a scandal at a maternity unit where mothers and babies died needlessly. Mike Farrar, a senior manager tipped to be the next head of the NHS, and the country’s chief nurse, Jane Cummings, are accused of failing to investigate unsafe care. Up to 14 babies and two mothers are feared to have died because of poor care at Furness General Hospital since 2001, while another nine infants suffered brain damage. Mike Farrar, a senior manager tipped to be head if the NHS, is accused of failing to investigate unsafe care . Last week it emerged that three officials at the Care Quality Commission had tried to cover up evidence of a botched inspection that took place in 2010 and passed the hospital as safe. Bereaved families believe that had the watchdog thoroughly investigated the unit, subsequent deaths of babies could have been avoided. Mr Farrar, 52, earns £200,000 a year as head of the NHS Confederation, which represents managers and hospital chief executives. He is in the running to succeed Sir David Nicholson as head of the NHS when he ‘retires early’ next year in the wake of his failings over the Mid Staffordshire scandal. From 2007 to 2011 Mr Farrar was chief executive of North West Strategic Health Authority, which should have been supervising the hospital. He was repeatedly warned by bereaved families about unsafe care and although he commissioned three reports to investigate the unit between 2008 and 2010, he never published the findings. Jane Cummings, who earns £130,000 per year, has also been accused of failing to intervene . He also reassured the CQC the unit was making improvements in 2010 and said there would be no need for further investigation. Mr Farrar’s actions are now being investigated by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, which is considering whether the strategic health authority is guilty of maladministration and failed to properly supervise midwives. His former deputy Jane Cummings, who now earns £130,000 a year as the chief nursing officer of the NHS, has also been accused of failing to intervene. She was formerly the chief nursing officer at the regional health body between 2007 and 2011, and served as deputy chief executive under Mr Farrar in her last six months. Her role was to monitor the ‘quality performance’ of hospitals in the region and the Mail understands she should have been aware of problems at the Furness maternity unit in Barrow, part of the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust. Up to 14 babies and two mothers are feared to have died because of poor care at Furness General Hospital since 2001 . Last night grieving families called on the pair to consider their positions. James Titcombe, 35, the father of baby Joshua, who died at the unit in 2008 when he was nine days old, said Mr Farrar ‘has never apologised to us or acknowledged his mistakes’. He added: ‘There was a failure of the North West Strategic Health Authority in its duty with midwifery supervision. Mr Farrar should consider his position. He has never taken responsibility for his role.’ The NHS Confederation, representing Mr Farrar, confirmed that three reviews of the maternity unit had been carried out between 2008 and 2010. It added the findings were never made public because they apparently involved the death of only one baby, Joshua Titcombe. Mrs Cummings, 52, said: ‘I am committed to staying in my current role to support nursing. ‘What happened at Morecambe Bay was very sad and must have been awful for the families. ‘I was deputy chief executive of the North West SHA from May to October 2011. I worked with staff and stakeholders to take action over issues brought to my attention.’","Manager Mike Farrar and chief nurse Jane Cummings face calls to resign .

Doing away with the clear and enunciated acting style of yesteryear, some  directors and producers actively encourage 'laidback mumbling', as it is more 'truthful', it has been said.

Imogen Stubbs as Lady Torrance in 'Orpheus Descending'. But the established theatre actress says too many actors are mumbling their way through lines leaving audiences struggling to understand them . Mr Kemp is concerned that the new style of delivery could mean audiences are driven away from stage productions of the works of Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde, among others, because they are unable to understand them, the Observer reports. Ms Stubbs is concerned that the muttering is an attempt to imitate American film stars. She leveled particular criticism at Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby, saying: 'You're just longing for it to stop and breathe...They were rather garbling their lines.' Mr Kemp said the problem was with 'education'.

He said he had even encountered a first year student who had achieved an English A-level who had no idea what a noun was, and revealed Rada had to do away with a sight-reading test of a Dickens passage from auditions because it was too painful to listen to. He said older and established actors honed their deliver through the use of pitch, intonation and tempo -  whereas today's actors relied on volume.

Foster, 34, who was threatened with arrest in Bognor Regis for having a blow up . doll in the back of his van . The driver of a replica Only Fools and Horses van was pulled over by police and threatened with arrest - for having a comedy blow-up doll in the back. Police in Bognor Regis, Sussex, told Richard Foster, 34, to remove the ‘offensive’ blonde doll visible in his Trotters Independent Trading Company van’s rear window. An officer told him the doll could cause ‘alarm or distress’ and threatened him with arrest if he didn’t do as he was told. In a classic episode of the hit comedy, wheeler dealer Del Boy and Rodney try to shift some latex sex dolls - but one inflates in the back of the yellow van. Mr Foster, who hires out a replica of the iconic three-wheel Reliant Regal that features in the series, was outraged by the claims and at first refused. But he was on his way to pick up a groom and best man for a wedding and had to give in or risk ruining the happy couple’s day if he was locked up. Mr Foster, from Bognor Regis, Sussex, said: 'When I first saw the police car’s blue lights flashing in my rear view mirror, I thought there must be an emergency. 'I pulled over on the road to let the police pass as I didn’t want to hold them up, and couldn’t believe it when they pulled in behind me. 'I have never had any problems or been stopped in the van before - normally police officers wave as they go past. 'The policeman got out of the car and told me to take the blow-up doll out of the window, otherwise I would be arrested. 'He said I was committing a Section 5 public order offence because the doll could cause alarm or distress. 'Here I was, dressed in a suit and tie at 11.15am on my way to chauffeur a groom and best man to a wedding. 'The doll is entirely non-sexual and has no sexual parts - she’s a comedy doll. 'The policeman didn’t care that I was going to be late, he told me to take the doll down or I would be arrested. 'I replied that people on stag and hen dos walk around in town with sex dolls all the time - are you going to arrest them?' Likely to cause 'alarm or distress'?

Blow: The Prime Minister David Cameron has said that he wants to extend the kind of 'privilege' he enjoyed to all young people . The majority of Britons still believe who you know matters more than what you know when it comes to getting on in life. The results of a new study comes as an embarrassing blow to David Cameron who has had to fend off criticism that he has surrounded himself with 'posh boys' in government. The poll also found that three-quarters of the population believe family background has a significant impact on a person’s life changes. The Prime Minister has come under fire recently after appointing a series of former Old Etonians like himself to key positions. He recently appointed former schoolmate Jo Johnson as head of his policy unit. Mr Johnson, the brother of London Mayor Boris, became the sixth Old Etonian in Cameron's inner circle. The other five are Jesse Norman, Ed Llewellyn, his chief of staff, Oliver Letwin, the Cabinet Office minister; Rupert Harrison, the chancellor's chief economics adviser; and Sir George Young, the chief whip. In his speech at the Conservative Party Conference last year Cameron vowed to build an 'aspiration nation' based on Tory values of 'individual effort' and 'hard work'. But the survey of 2,272 adults for the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, found 65% of the public thought 'who you know matters more than what you know' in Britain today. Criticism: David Cameron came under fire when he appointed former Old Etonian Jo Johnson, left, as the head of policy in Number 10 .

The . survey found 84% of people believe employers should pay wages that . better reflect the cost of living to support the working poor. And some 76% believed family background significantly influences an individual’s chances of doing well in life. But there was a split when people were asked about their own background, with 41% agreeing and 41% disagreeing that their parents’ income had influenced where they had got to in life. Seven in 10 people thought a good education was the key to getting a good job but nearly half thought it remained out of reach for most children from lower income families. Two-thirds thought government had a role in tackling in-work poverty and 75% thought the government should top-up the incomes of the working poor. Some 84% said that employers should be providing more opportunities for progression for their employees. The Commission’s chairman, former Labour minister Alan Milburn, said: 'These findings show the high levels of public concern about unfairness in Britain. 'Flatlining social mobility and rising child poverty is not a viable proposition for our country. 'Both government and employers should heed the call to pay decent wages to help the forgotten five million people who are the working poor.'","New survey commissioned by Government come as blow for David Cameron .

A report published on Tuesday morning shows Americans find flying even more trying than going to the post office. The report, by the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), shows that although U.S. consumers are slightly happier with airline service than they were last year, they still rank airlines behind the U.S. Postal Service for customer satisfaction. The ACSI Index is an independent body developed by the University of Michigan to measure customer satisfaction. Low score: The airline industry still has a way to go before customers rate it on a par with the U.S. Postal Service . For its June report, the ACSI surveyed 70,000 Americans and found the only industries below airlines for customer dissatisfaction are subscription TV and Internet service providers. It's no mean feat to come in with a lower score than the industry that spawned the term 'going postal', but according to ACSI's report, it's not all bad news for the industry. Mail madness: A series of disgruntled postal worker shootings gave rise to the term 'going postal', to mean extreme and uncontrollable anger - but the USPS still scores higher than the airline industry for customer satisfaction . This year, the industry as a whole scored 69 out of a possible 100 points (USPS scored 77 points). In addition to a three per cent improvement on last year's score, two low-cost airlines scored highly in the survey. JetBlue and Southwest airlines scored 83 per cent and 81 per cent, respectively. The lowest-scoring airlines was United, which scored only 62 per cent. Remain seated: Size and comfort of airplane seats was one of the areas customers took issue with . The airline industry responded to the low score, saying that airlines compare favorably to other modes of transport such as taxis, and that prices have not increased in line with inflation. Spokesperson for Airlines for America Jean Medina told the LA Times that airlines received only 1.18 complaints for every 100,000 passengers that flew in 2011. By comparison, New York City taxis got 3,125 complaints for every 100,000 passengers that year.

A New York restaurateur claiming to be a descendant of Vlad the Impaler is set to open a £4million restaurant in London’s Mayfair. Nello Balan plans to open a branch of Nello, his Italian restaurant on Manhattan’s Madison Avenue known for its outrageously expensive food. Mr Balan famously does not disclose the prices of his specials at his already expensive restaurant, and recently charged an unsuspecting diner £175 for a portion of truffle pasta. Flashy venue: Nello Balan is set to open a £4million branch of his New York restaurant Nello in London's Mayfair . A lease in Mayfair often involves a rent of £100,000 a year, but David Rawlinson, director of Restaurant Property plans to broker the London deal, believes that Mr Balan will have no problem paying on time. Describing the Manhattan branch of Nello to The Times, Mr Rawlinson said: ‘It’s a café for the super-rich. It’s not for the price sensitive.’ Romanian-born Mr Balan may or may not be a descendant of Vlad the Impaler, the 15th century blood thirsty count who inspired Bram Stoker's Dracula, but the above is definitely true. Nello's Manhattan branch of the shop has been described as a cafe for the super-rich . Controversial: Mr Balan, pictured with a Romanian footballer in his Manhattan restaurant, was last year sued by his staff for diverting $100,000 (£63,860) of tips to his daughter and driver . The prices at Nello are enough to make anyone’s eyes water and the restaurant is famous for not informing customers of how much they charge for their ‘daily specials’. Like forefather, like descendant: Romanian native Mr Balan claims to be a descendant of Vlad the Impaler, the 15th century count that inspired Dracula . One recent guest at Nello’s learned this the hard way after he took a liking to the sound of a truffle pasta special – unaware that he was being charged $275 (£175). ‘For a moment I thought I was hallucinating,’ the customer wrote in a letter to the New York Times. ‘The meal for the three of us cost $400. How was that possible? ‘Easy. The pasta dish cost $275’ When the customer confronted the . waiter about the outrageous bill he was told that he should have . expected high prices at Nello because it had been in the location for . over 20 years – and it is close to branch of French luxury brand Hermes. This is not the only controversy surrounding Mr Balan. Last . year he was sued by his employees for making them work 60-hour weeks . without overtime and diverting $100,000 (£63,860) a year in tips to his daughter, . his driver and managers. In 2008 he failed in an attempt to sue a lingerie model who had borrowed his $5,000 umbrella and returned it broken. He . has also been accused of leaking bills of famous customers, such as . Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovic, something which he has vehemently . denied. Vlad the Impaler was born in 1431 in the citadel of Sighisoara, Transylvania. His father was Vlad II or Dracul, a night in the Order of the Dragon - a secret fraternity created in 1387. He did not get the 'impaler' moniker until after his death and was known as Vlad Dracula - the added 'a' means 'son of' and 'Dracul' means 'devil'. Vlad Dracul was assassinated in 1447 in a coup by one of his relatives and Vlad Dracula became Vlad III. He was released from the captivity of Sultan Murad II who had kept him and his brother as 'insurance' for his father's guarantee not to strike against the Turks. He vowed revenge and employed the help of the Turkish cavalry to defeat the boyars who had taken his throne while he was in captivity. He killed his father's murderer in 1456 and defeated Vladislav II to take over as new ruler of Wallachia. He held a feast on Easter Sunday of 1569 and many of the boyar families were there. He had them arrested and those who could work were condemned to slavery. Those who could not were impaled.

Dwight Dupree, of Gillsville, Ga., was crushed by a tree limb seconds after telling his young niece to run for safety when they were playing under the large tree last week, according to WGCL-TV. 'He told me to run and then boom a tree hit him,' Dupree's niece, Cara Johnson, said. Saved: Dwight Dupree got his 6-year-old niece Cara Johnson out of the way before a tree, pictured behind Cara, fell on him . 'I called my mom. And then they took him to the hospital,' Cara said. Another relative said Dupree pushed Cara out of the way before he was crushed when the tree fell on the afternoon of June 19. 'He was sitting under the tree and heard a big crack,' Donta Ware, Dupree’s nephew, told the Gainsville Times. 'He had his niece with him and tried to push her out of the way — she’s OK, but the tree caught him across the small of the back.' Cara's brother heard the tree fall from inside the Johnson's home in Hall County. Josh Johnson, 16, ran outside and found his uncle on the ground under a tree branch. 'It was sort of like a meteor, earthquake thing,' Josh said, describing the crushing snap of the tree. 'I just moved it out the way so the medics could get by him.' Crushed: After a branch fell on him, Dwight Johnson was taken to a hospital where he had surgery to treat a cracked spine and internal bleeding . Dupree was taken to a nearby hospital where doctors originally believed he only hurt his back. After further evaluation, Dupree was taken into emergency surgery to treat a cracked spine and internal bleeding. As of Thursday night, Dupree was in stable condition. Cara's father, Jeff Johnson, thanked God and Dupree for saving his daughter. 'He saved her life. If she had stayed up in there it probably would have crushed both of them,' Johnson said. 'It's a blessing. May God be with him.' Johnson said the tree looked rotten on the inside when he came home from work after the accident. The tree, which sits in Johnson's front yard, was hit by lightening a few years ago. 'It just caught us off guard,' Johnson said of the accident. The tree also knocked down a power line, according to the Times. Danger: Cara's father Jeff Johnson said the tree that fell on her uncle had been struck by lightening twice before and looked 'rotten' on the inside after the accident . Dupree and his niece often play under the tree in the yard together, Ware said. 'Every day they sit out under the tree and try to enjoy the shade,' Ware said. 'It was a rotten tree — I knew one day it would fall. I feel like my uncle saved her life.' Ware lives a few minutes away from the Johnson's and rushed to the scene after the accident. Ware said that despite the 'big gash in the small of his back,' Dupree was moving and conscious when paramedics took him away. One of the tree's larger limbs landed on Cara's wagon, trapping her teddy bear. 'He got crushed,' Cara said to WGCL-TV about her bear, though the station notes Cara was unaware as of last week the extent of her uncle's injuries.

Spot the difference: George Osborne (right) was repeatedly referred to as 'Jeffrey' by US President Barack Obama, who confused him with favourite R&B singer Jeffrey Osborne (left) The Chancellor told BBC One today: ‘He's asked . me for a duet, and sadly I can't sing. He's now asked me for a game of . golf, but I can't play golf. So it's not going very well, this new . friendship.’ He added, speaking to The Andrew Marr . Show: ‘It's nice to be on first-name terms with the President . of the United States - even if he sometimes gets the name wrong. That's the way I look at it.’ Mr Osborne had jetted into the second . day of the G8 summit in Northern Ireland, determined to impress the . world’s most powerful leaders with his plan to get tough with global tax . dodgers. But his pride suffered a major setback . when the leader of the free world got him confused with R&B star . Jeffrey Osborne - who most famously sang the 1982 hit On The Wings of . Love. Mr Obama called him ‘Jeffrey’ three times, to the visible embarrassment of the Chancellor. ‘It was obvious Osborne didn’t like . being called “Jeffrey”,’ a government source said last week. ‘Why would . he? His name is George.’ Mistake: Chancellor George Osborne (pictured), speaking to The Andrew Marr Show, said it was 'nice to be on first-name terms with the President of the United States - even if he sometimes gets the name wrong' Confused: US President Obama later apologised to the Chancellor for getting in a muddle about his name . In fact the Chancellor’s real name is Gideon Oliver Osborne but switched to George aged 13 as a ‘small act of rebellion’. Last week the soul singer said he was . delighted to get a name-check at the G8 summit. And in a bizarre twist . suggested singing a duet up with the Chancellor. 'He's asked me for a duet, and sadly I can't sing. He's now asked me for a game of golf, but I can't play golf. So it's not going very well, this new friendship' Chancellor George Osborne . Jeffrey Osborne told Sky News: 'I was . really delighted, actually. I was really not aware that he was that much . of a fan that he would call the Chancellor Jeffrey Osborne. 'Tell the Chancellor when I come over I . will have to hook up with him and we will do a duet of On The Wings Of . Love, or something.' Jeffrey Osborne's entry in online . encyclopaedia Wikipedia was tampered with by a mischievous user to reflect Mr . Obama's inadvertent appointment of the singer to the Treasury. After being edited, the entry . read: 'Jeffrey Linton Osborne (born March 9, 1948) is an American funk . and R&B musician, songwriter, lyricist, former lead singer of the . band, L.T.D., and as of June 2013, is the Chancellor of the Exchequer . and Second Lord of the Treasury of the United Kingdom.' Joke: Mr Osborne has now seen the funny side of the President's slip-up, which was the talk of Westminster . The bogus information remained online . for under an hour before being erased. The name gaffe by Mr Obama came . despite Mr Osborne boasting of his close links with the White House. After delivering a 90-minute . presentation on global data-sharing plans to stop companies and . individual’s hiding their profits in tax havens, Mr Osborne was left . deflated when Mr Obama responded: ‘Thanks for that, Jeffrey.’ 'It's nice to be on first-name terms with the President of the United States - even if he sometimes gets the name wrong. That's the way I look at it' Chancellor George Osborne . But the two men could not be more . different. The Chancellor is the son of Sir Peter Osborne, 17th baronet . of Ballintaylor and Ballylemon. By contrast the father of . singer-songwriter Jeffrey Osborne was Clarence ‘Legs’ Osborne, a trumpet . player who played with Duke Ellington and Count Basie. He had a total of 12 children but died . when Jeffrey was just 13. In an attempt to make amends, Mr Obama . insisted that he did know Mr Osborne’s name really. ‘I’m sorry, man. I must have confused you with my favourite R&B singer,’ he said.","US President called Chancellor 'Jeffrey' during G8 meeting last week .

Tina Oliver, 44, a hairdresser from Harrogate, was inspired to drop the pounds after seeing a photo of herself weighing 19 stone and wearing size 26 clothes about to tuck into a plate of cakes and treats. The image, coupled with a warning from her doctor that she could become diabetic if she carried on with her dangerous eating habits, was the final push she needed. So she invested in something that helped her lose eight stone and drop nine dress sizes: a piece of string. Tina Oliver went from a 19st size 26, right, to an 11st size 10, just by using a technique favoured by slimmers in Ancient Egypt, that involves tying a piece of string around the waist . Tina Oliver was inspired to drop the pounds after seeing a photo of herself about to tuck into a plate of cakes and treats . By using a Malory Band slimming aid - a piece of string tied around the waist to stop you eating too much, and shortened as the weight drops - and following the Slimming World plan, Tina, who had tried every diet imaginable in the past, has gone from nearly 19 stone to 11 stone, and from a size 28 to a 10. Tina said: 'Last September I was so fat I could barely stand, and I struggled to work as a hairdresser. Seeing the photo of me in front of a pile of cakes was the last straw. I looked and felt terrible. 'Then I was warned about my long-term health by my doctor if I carried on eating as I was. It was just what I needed to kick-start me into losing weight and getting healthy' Tina was given the band by a friend as a motivational tool, and also joined her local Slimming World and the gym. She said: 'I was so determined. Now I'm looking forward to doing the Great North Run, something I never could have imagined doing. I look in the mirror sometimes and I can't believe it's me.' It was only in October last year that Tina was told by her doctor told her if she didn't slim down she would get diabetes. Her teeth were also rotting from years spent munching sweets, cakes, takeaways and chocolate, and desperate Tina had a morbidly obese Body Mass Index of 43. Tina swapped her diet of crisps, sweets and junk food for healthy food choices, as well as wearing the Malory Band and taking up running . The Malory Band is a string tied around the waist to prevent you eating beyond the point of feeling full . Then a friend told her about the Malory Band, which is a slimming aid used by the Egyptians to help shrink the waistline and get get back in shape after childbirth . It fits round the waist and is a constant reminder to the user to watch what they eat, which is tightened as they slim down. Desperate enough to try anything, Tina decided to give it a whirl, and each week she would tighten the band and follow the Slimming World eating plan - while making regular trips to the gym. Tina said: 'It saved my life. Before I would live on chocolate, biscuits and crisps all day. I was working as a hairdresser so it was easier just to grab something rather than have a sit down meal. Tina is now preparing to do the Great North Run after shedding half her body weight . 'At dinnertime I'd have a Chinese takeaway or a pizza, and I'd drink cups of tea with two sugars in all day. The only exercise I did was walk the dog. 'Being told I was borderline diabetic wasn't nice. I'd tried so many diets over the years but nothing really worked. This was the shock I needed to act. 'I started using the band and doing Slimming World. Every time I ate I would feel it pinch, and I'd stop eating. 'So as well as me having set meals to follow, as soon as my stomach was starting to expand, the band would kick in and stop me. 'It made me realise I didn't need to carry on eating, and the weight came off so quickly. I was still having a healthy diet, but the band was literally reining me in and helping me lose even more weight. 'I joined the gym too, and the support I have had there has been amazing. I nearly passed out in my induction but I was determined to slim. 'Now people come up to me and tell me how well I have done. It really spurs me on.' And Tina is enjoying feeling healthier and fitter than ever. 'I could barely walk when I started,' she said. 'Now I can run 10k without stopping - and I'm looking forward to doing the Great North Run. 'I'm so excited about it, and I can't believe that I'm ready to do it. I never could have imagined this time last year that I would be able to walk a mile, never mind run a half marathon.' Saying that losing weigh has 'totally changed my life', Tina added: 'I can't express how happy I am about losing the weight. I have more confidence and energy and am a much happier person. 'Before, I'd go out with my friends and just want to hide away as they were all so slim and healthy. Now, I go shopping with them and chat about fashion. 'I wear trendy dresses and look forward to getting dressed up for a night out. I feel young again. 'My husband Michael has always said he loved me no matter what my size was, and now he's thrilled to see me so happy and spends his life outside changing rooms while I try on slinky new clothes!' Tina, who was borderline diabetic and could barely move before she lost weight, says the Malory Band has saved her life and given her back her confidence . And it's not only Michael who is pleased to see Tina so happy and healthy. On recent trip back to the doctor who gave her the scare she needed, he didn't even recognise the new, slim Tina: 'I went back to give him a box of chocolates for giving me the shock I needed.' Now Tina has porridge or muesli for breakfast, snacks on fruit and yoghurt, eats a salad for lunch and has fish or chicken and vegetables for dinner. And she is thrilled to have hit her 11 stone target and has lost 16 inches from her waist and 15 from her chest and hips. With the Great North Run looming in September, she's set to lose even more weight. She said: 'Even though I'm not eating anywhere near as much, I have so much more energy. My skin is bright and I look and feel ten years younger. I just wish I'd done it ten years ago. 'The band was a massive help and having a structured eating plan that was easy to follow was good too. Now I'm training so much, I'm expecting to lose another half a stone. 'And when I cross the finish line, I'll remember what I was just a year earlier, staring at a pile of cakes, and feel very proud.'","Tina Oliver, 44, from Harrogate went from a 19st size 26 to an 11st size 10 .

He is a devout Catholic who voted against same-sex marriage – but there’s at least one person Tory MP David Amess hasn’t persuaded to share his traditionalist views: his own daughter Katie. The 27-year-old aspiring actress is hoping to make her mark in Hollywood with a movie spoof called Misérable Lesbians, which aims to promote gay equality. She said: ‘I have always been  pro-gay rights. Misérable Lesbians is a jokey title with a very serious message, which is that everyone deserves equal rights. Blonde Courgette is played by Katie Amess daughter of Tory MP David. They say that the film has a serious message . ‘I love my father and he’s entitled to his opinion but I disagree with him on gay marriage.’ The 61-year-old Commons veteran – who defied his close friend David Cameron on the same-sex marriage vote in February – has not seen the film yet and Katie admits: ‘It’s not at all his cup of tea.’Katie, a former Miss Essex, now lives in the gay-friendly neighbourhood of West Hollywood, sometimes dubbed Boys’ Town. In the film, she plays ‘Courgette’ – a play on the character of Cosette in the original Les Misérables. She is a young girl who ‘fights the good fight’ in revolutionary France to help a rebel band of lesbians achieve their goal of sexual freedom. She said: ‘A lot of the lyrics in Misérable Lesbians are not suitable to print in a family newspaper.’ ‘The film was made on a shoestring but it’s the biggest part I’ve had so far and it was great fun to make. I’m hoping this is my big break.’ Katie says that her dad has not seen the spoof but that it would not be his cup of tea . The short film was made for the Toscar . Awards – an event for parodies run by Britons based in Los Angeles – . where it won eight prizes, and is now set to be expanded into a . 45-minute stage play for the Edinburgh Fringe in August. Katie hopes her dad will come ‘with the rest of my family and friends’ to see that version. ‘He and I don’t talk politics,’ she added. ‘But he’s always been very supportive of my dreams of being an actress. ‘I have my own views and I am very pro-gay rights, even though I am straight myself I believe everyone should be treated equally and I am proud to do my bit to support gays and lesbians and raise awareness of this very important issue.  I am sure Dad is happy I am finally working. Mum’s watched the film, but Dad hasn’t.’ David Amess defied David Cameron on the same-sex marriage vote in February . Misérable Lesbians writer and director Sandro Monetti said: ‘Gay rights is a hot topic around the world right now and through our comedy musical we hope not only to make people laugh but also to make them think. Our show is about women in 19th Century France locked up for the crime of falling in love with each other. They – and the brave rebels who support them – dream a dream of gay marriage one day being legal. ‘The recent change to legalise gay marriage in France is a cause for celebration for many, and hopefully this show will be too. ‘We have schoolboy humour, and characters but there’s a serious message amid all the silliness. Katie is an outstanding talent and is integral to the success of the project.’ Last night MP Amess said: ‘Obviously I have heard all about the spoof film Misérable Lesbians but have yet to see it. I am hoping to go to Edinburgh to see the performance in the summer.’ In a statement he added: ‘We are enormously proud of our daughter and her utter determination to make a success of her acting career. We also fully recognise what a very tough industry it is and how highly competitive.’ Katie admits that she has struggled to make it since arriving in Hollywood two years ago: ‘I’ve been on lots of auditions and I’ve done quite a few commercials,’ she said. ‘But Misérable Lesbians is my first proper film role.’ She and her castmates are trying to raise money to stage the show in Edinburgh and off-Broadway in New York through the crowdfunding website Indiegogo.com, while the original short film is available to view on YouTube.","David Amess's daughter Katie is in the movie Miserable Lesbians .

An artist commissioned by David Cameron to create a gift for the world’s most powerful leaders has described the 'nightmare' of having his work vetted by civil servants who feared it might spark a diplomatic incident. Phil Shaw, 63, a printmaker from Yorkshire, was hand-picked by Downing Street to create a one-off work to be given to Barack Obama, Vladamir Putin, Angela Merkel and the rest of the G8 leaders who met in Northern Ireland last week. Dr Shaw is known for his £1,200 'bookshelf' prints, which depict rows of related volumes with the titles often including jokes or hidden meanings. Read all about it: The 'Group of Eight' artwork by Phil Shaw . But his bespoke 'Group of Eight' work was only cleared by Whitehall officials following weeks of scrutiny and several changes made to avoid causing offence. 'It really got very stressful and at one point I thought I would not be able to do it by the deadline,' the artist confessed. He was approached last month to create the computer-generated print for a limited edition of ten - one for each G8 leader plus the presidents of the European Council and Commission. Initially he was asked to choose one of three themes - 'Ireland,' 'Leaders,' or 'the work of the Group of Eight economic nations'. Under the cosh: Artist Phil Shaw has spoke of how he thought he might miss the deadline for his work of art due to stringent checks . He chose the Group of Eight and spent hours researching various library collections for suitable books about the economy, mysteries of tax havens and actress Angelina Jolie’s campaign against rape of women in war zones, all items on the Lough Erne summit agenda. The government approved his idea to choose books with a hidden message. The first word of each title completes a saying from 18th century economist and moral philosopher, Adam Smith - 'What can be added to the Happiness of a Man who is in health, out of debt and has a clear conscience.' The artist then attempted to find suitable books written by authors with the same names as the G8 leaders. He found plenty of titles by David Cameron and other leaders, but was forced to scrap the plan when the only other work by someone called Barack Obama was a Japanese book entitled: 'I am a Naughty Boy.' ‘I really couldn’t use that, so I decided to look for titles for every country at the summit.' This opened up an arcane and complex world of government protocol. Officials scrutinised each title and ruled out any book that could cause embarrassment or upset. 'I got very polite emails but they didn’t like some books. One was ‘Man and Woman, War and Peace - A Strategist’s Companion’ by Anthony Wilden. I don’t know why, maybe they did not want a reference to war. I managed to replace it with a citizenship textbook ‘Man The Citizen.’' the artist said. 'They also objected to 'A Guide for the Perplexed' by E.F. Schumacher. He was a Nobel Prize-winning economist who worked for the National Coal Board and coined the phrase ‘Small in Beautiful.’ They didn’t tell me why they didn’t like it, maybe he worked for a Labour administration or something. Perhaps they didn’t like perplexed, But because of that I lost my only German reference in the bookshelf. I replaced it with ‘A Treatise on Government’ by Aristotle, so I did  manage to get a Greek in there. 'But the one I was most worried about was ‘Of Cabbages and Kings’ I have no idea what’s wrong with that, it’s a cookery book, but maybe there’s a problem with cabbages. I was really worried about this, there aren’t many titles beginning with ‘Of.’ But I found a textbook about tax  called ‘Of Rule and Revenue.’ I don’t know who checked the titles, but it went through two or three people so nobody would be upset.' G8 plus two: (L-R) European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister David Cameron, U.S. President Barack Obama, Russia's President Vladimir Putin, France's President Francois Hollande, Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Italy's Prime Minister Enrico Letta and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy . And it wasn’t just the titles frowned on by the mandarins. Dr Shaw had hoped to use the colours of each nation’s flag to make a bright picture. 'But there was a problem with the different widths of the book. They were worried that  one country might be offended if their flag colours were on a smaller book than another. I then got an email asking me to use blue because that is the colour of the Northern Ireland Assembly.' The final result which took 160 hours to complete is a stunning horizontal 29ins by 14ins print. A Number 10 spokeswoman declined to give details about the vetting process for the leaders’ gift but said: 'We commissioned Phil Shaw to produce something for the G8 and then worked with him to make sure the piece fitted our requirements. Phil gave us lots of options on books, colours etc. Everyone was delighted with the piece, especially the hidden phrase.' Read all about it: 'Conscience', 'Debt' and 'Health and Wealth' are all suited to current political debate . She did not know where Mr Cameron intended to hang the picture. Dr Shaw was chosen for the task after a Cabinet Office  official spotted his work at an exhibition. His prints of the London underground were then purchased by the Government Art Collection and displayed in the main G8 summit room. He is represented by the Rebecca Hossack Galleries in London and New York. The G8 nations are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the USA and UK.","Phil Shaw hand-picked by Downing Street to create one-off work .

With heavyweight designer and respected film . director already on his CV, Tom Ford is one of fashion's most accomplished names. Now he has added photographer to his list of talents, having shot all the images for his newest fashion campaign himself. The dapper 51-year-old called on a few of his model friends, Gemma Aicha Refoufi, Herieth Paul, Soo Joo and Zuzanna Bijoch, who pose against a white background in his bold 'Ka-pow' print gowns. Ka-pow! Tom Ford appears to have taken a style lead from Andy Warhol for his latest campaign . In typical style, the images are rather risque: in some shots the models conceal their modesty with just their hands. In others, they wear bright eye make-up which has been matched to their eye-catching dresses. In the menswear ads for Ford's . brand-new ready-to-wear and eyewear collections, models Conrad Bromfield, Juan . Betancourt, and Oli Tyler join forces to showcase the designer's . classic tailoring which makes the most of more muted colours. Racy: The campaign features models Soo Joo and Zuzanna Bijoch as well as exclusives with Gem and Herieth Paul . Who are you calling Four Eyes? Ford's eyewear is hugely popular, and this new collection looks set to be no different. All images in the new autumn/winter ads were shot by the designer himself . Ford described the set of images, which were shot in London, as 'cross cultural multi ethnic'. The photographs make the most of . Ford's autumn/winter 2013 collection, which won high praise from the . style set when it hit the catwalk last February. Styleite's Hilary George-Parkin wrote: 'Ford’s . work is never quite designed with a wallflower in mind, of course, but . this collection in particular harkened back to some of his most decadent . work for Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent — and then upped the ante (and . the saturation) by a few notches.'

Bold and beautiful: Calling on a few of his fashionable female friends, models Gemma Aicha Refoufi and Herieth Paul pose alongside Soo Joo and Zuzanna Bijoch against a white background . In the making: The new images will break on the Tom Ford website in August . ELLE’s Rebecca Lowthorpe was equally impressed. ‘The overall effect was of a decadence . that could only possibly be enjoyed by the world’s most wealthy,' she wrote. 'They will surely love his monochrome . section of patchworked furs and leathers with long swishing fringes, or . the ""sportswear""– loosely termed – that included multi-bright floral . beaded ""hoodies"". Here come the boys: As for the men's campaign for Ford's brand-new ready-to-wear and eyewear collections, Conrad Bromfield, Juan Betancourt, and Oli Tyler join forces . Suave: The male models showcase the designer's classic tailoring in muted colors . Ford, who gained international fame thanks to his work for Gucci in the Nineties, previously chose controversial industry legend Terry . Richardson to shoot his campaigns. This latest campaign is less provocative than seasons past, representing a new direction for the label.

Martin's shooting death and the initial decision not to charge Zimmerman led to public outrage and demonstrations around the nation, with some accusing Sanford police of failing to thoroughly investigate the shooting. The six jurors were culled from a pool of 40 jury candidates who made it into a second round of jury questioning. Before selecting the jurors Thursday, defense attorney Mark O'Mara explored potential jurors' views on whether they thought sympathy should play a role in deciding a case. Juror B-72, a young Hispanic man, said he wasn't affected by sympathetic people because he's never had many close relationships. Gracie Zimmerman, left, sister of George Zimmerman, his father, Robert Zimmerman Sr., second from left, his mother, Gladys, second from right, and wife Shellie Zimmerman, right, sit in Seminole circuit court during George Zimmerman's trial . Sybrina Fulton, left, and Tracy Martin, the parents of slain teen Trayvon Martin, sit with their attorney Benjamin Crump, right . 'So when a person might seem sympathetic, to me it's indifferent,' he said. O'Mara also asked the jurors about when they thought self-defense could be used. Juror H-6, a white man in his 30s, said he thought deadly force could be warranted if a person feels danger. 'I feel that if you're somewhere you're supposed to be and allowed to be, you should have the right to defend yourself,' he said. O'Mara met resistance from the judge when he tried to characterize the definition for justifiable use of deadly force. Prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda objected multiple times during O'Mara's line of questioning, eventually leading to Judge Debra Nelson to twice read what will be the jury instruction once the final jury is selection. 'I don't want either side to give an interpretation on the law,' Nelson said. O'Mara said screening the prospective jurors for any biases or prejudices 'is probably as critical if not more critical than the evidence.' 'If you bring that into the courtroom, then what we can't get is a fair verdict,' he said.

Fears: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond says the army will be 'tied by health and safety' British troops could be prevented from carrying out vital missions after an explosive human rights ruling, the Defence Secretary has warned. Philip Hammond said the judgment means military chiefs will be ‘living in fear’ of being sued. He fears our forces risk being reduced to Continental-style peacekeeping roles – which see some countries refuse to let their personnel go out after dark – after judges decreed that the European Convention on Human Rights applies on the battlefield. Mr Hammond is understood to be so furious at the Supreme Court ruling that he is considering demanding a revocation and believes it strengthens the case for Britain quitting the ECHR. The Defence Secretary told the Daily Mail: ‘There are real concerns that British troops could be prevented from carrying out their missions for fear of falling foul of human rights legislation. We can’t have troop commanders living in fear of how lawyers back in London might interpret their battlefield decisions that are vital to protecting our national security. ‘There could be serious implications for our ability to work with international partners who are not bound by the ECHR.’ Following the Supreme Court ruling that the ECHR does apply even in combat situations, Mr Hammond has ordered a review of the implications for military commanders and troops. The prospect of ‘health and safety’ type laws applying to the battlefield could seriously impact on Britain’s military capability, he said. Flood of litigation: Defence officials fear there will be endless compensation demands and curbs on military capability . A source added: ‘If the ECHR applies to personnel on operations it is feared that commanders may be reluctant to make decisions in the field that will then be second-guessed by lawyers in London. ‘We don’t want to be tied up by health and safety rules that prevent troops patrolling at night or only with certain equipment.’ Ministers have also asked officials to reassure worried international counterparts that the UK will continue to be a committed and effective partner on combined missions. Earlier this week, families of some British soldiers killed or injured fighting in Iraq were given the go-ahead to bring compensation claims against the Government. The Supreme Court ruled that cases of troops killed while driving Land Rovers could be brought under the ‘right to life’ enshrined in article two of the ECHR, potentially outlawing the future deployment of troops with outdated equipment. It also ruled that families of soldiers killed by ‘friendly fire’ from Challenger tanks could sue for negligence because the traditional doctrine of combat immunity should not cover decisions ‘far removed from active operations against the enemy’. Sue Smith, mother of Private  Phillip Hewett, 21, of Tamworth, Staffordshire, who died in July 2005 after a Snatch Land Rover was blown up, said it meant soldiers could no longer be treated as ‘sub-human with no rights’. But defence officials now fear they could face a huge bill from a flood of litigation. Conservative MP Dominic Raab, a lawyer who has campaigned for reform of human rights law, said: ‘This week’s novel ruling by the Supreme Court – stretching the Human Rights Act to allow soldiers to sue the Government over decisions on equipment, training and operations – will endanger our forces and undermine democratic accountability. ‘The Government should be held accountable if it puts soldiers at unnecessary risk.’But he added: ‘A surge of litigation risks diverting the very money that should be spent on training, equipment and care. What happens if troops are caught off-guard or stretched thin?’ Colonel Richard Kemp, former head of British forces in Afghanistan, said: ‘We cannot allow a constricting health and safety culture to creep  in and prevent the vital job our  soldiers do.’","Defence secretary is reportedly furious at the ECHR intervention .

"PUBLISHED: . 17:45 EST, 23 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:47 EST, 23 June 2013 . Senior military figures have warned David Cameron not to cut the foreign aid budget - even as it emerged British taxpayers will fund a £14million new jail in Somalia. Nine prominent figures including former chiefs of the defence staff Sir Mike Richards and Lord Stirrup say international aid is ‘crucial to the UK’s national interests.’ They wrote in an open letter that aid addresses the ‘root causes of conflict’ and helps to spread effective government in failing states - to stop them becoming lawless. Money for Mogadishu: Somalia will receive British aid to put towards a prison for militants and criminals . The Prime Minister, who is facing bitter opposition from Tory MPs over foreign aid, has made clear he is open to suggestions to divert some of it to the Ministry of Defence. But the defence chiefs, including former security minister and head of the Royal Navy, Lord West, oppose such a plan advocating it should remain separate. They say ‘the military is rarely decisive on its own’ and the root causes of conflict and extremism should be tackled with ‘focused and accountable international development spending.’ ‘If Britain is to punch its weight on the international stage, it is essential both to fund defence properly and to maintain our internationally respected pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid to help the world’s poorest people’, they wrote. Overseas aid will reach 0.7 per cent of GDP - one of the highest levels in the Western world - this year, having risen every year under the Coalition. Conflicting advice: David Cameron has been advised by senior military figures not to cut the aid budget . But it has been plagued by reports it is being misused by corrupt governments. The largest beneficiary Pakistan, which will receive £446million next year - collects tax from just one per cent of its people. Aid has been cut off to India - worth around £200million a year - as it has enough money for its own space programme. The debate around foreign aid - which has been ring-fenced while other department face swingeing budget cuts - has been sharpened ahead of this week’s Spending Review. Departments must find £11.5billion of spending cuts and several are yet to settle with the Treasury on where the axe will fall. It emerged over the weekend that Britain is spending £14million of rebuilding a 180-year-old jail in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, to hold 700 inmates including terrorists and pirates. The pot of taxpayers’ money will also fund mobile criminal courts in the country which is plagued by al-Qaeda linked militants. It is hoped this will make it easier to deport more than 400 Somali criminals currently in UK jails because there is nowhere to detain them in their home country. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: ‘By building jail places and courts in Somalia we can help our African allies challenge terror and crime on their own doorstep so less ends up on ours.’","Overseas aid will reach 0.7 per cent of British GDP this year .

NHS bosses should brace themselves for a new storm of criticism when 'damning' evidence about Jimmy Savile's hospital sex attacks is revealed, lawyers said today. Liz Dux,  one of the lawyers representing his victims, said Savile's offences on NHS property were just as bad as those committed on the BBC premises and in some cases much worse. Dux, of Slater & Gordon, added that more people in the NHS than previously thought knew about what was happening and took no action. Inquiry: Jimmy Savile at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire, where he carried out a series of sex attacks . She said one victim had been assaulted . while lying on a hospital trolley going to have an x-ray, and another . was passing in a wheelchair when she was attacked. Dux told The Sunday Times: 'The evidence against the NHS is as bad [as the BBC] if not worse. I think the degree of knowledge was greater - clearly there was knowledge at the BBC but it was less concentrated. Here we have people seeing him [commit offences] and having direct knowledge. 'The NHS abuses are horrific. There were quite a few rapes on NHS premises. The evidence from the two main hospitals is absolutely damning.' There are three separate inquiries under way into Savile's crimes, focusing on Stoke Mandeville, Leeds General and Broadmoor hospitals. It is not just the nature of the offences that has shocked lawyers but also the response - or lack of it - by the staff. One of the victims Dux is representing was a young girl at the time of Savile's attack. 'She was raped and then told a nurse about the attack. The nurse said: ""I mustn't say anything or I'll get into trouble"",' Dux said. New evidence: Disgraced DJ Jimmy Savile presenting Top of the Pops in 1976 . Leeds General Hospital is one of three hospitals where inquiries are under way into Jimmy Savile's crimes . 'There are stories of Savile being on . top of people in the wards and nurses just saying ""Oh, get out Jimmy, . you shouldn't be in here"".' In an incident at Leeds General, where Savile worked as a volunteer porter, one victim was attacked in the porter's office. When the attack was over, the door was opened from outside by someone other than Savile, as if that person knew what had been happening. Dux said her clients at Leeds appeared to believe that there were other people assisting him and complicit in his crimes. Liz Dux, one of the lawyers representing his victims, said Savile's offences on NHS property were just as bad as those committed on the BBC premises. Pictured is Broadcasting House in London . In another incident at Leeds Dux said a girl was ignored when she complained to staff that a porter had hurt her and pointed to her groin. Dux is backing a new system of 'mandatory reporting' to force staff to report any such incidents. Such is the level of concern about the fallout from the inquiries into Savile's activities in the NHS that GPs have been warned that victims and witnesses distressed by giving evidence may turn up in their surgeries. The Stoke Mandeville inquiry is due to finish taking evidence soon, while the inquiry at Leeds is progressing. Dr Bill Kirkup, the lead investigator into Savile's offending at Broadmoor, has now launched an appeal for more witnesses to come forward.

Support: Art by Tracey Emin will be sold to help raise funds to send 'liquid food' to Africa . For thousands of Britons, packs of nutritionally balanced ‘liquid food’ will be familiar as a weight loss tool. Most famously used in the LighterLife plan, they have helped more than 100,000 men and women tackle obesity. Dieters who follow the plan eat only the oil-based pastes, specially formulated to contain all that is needed to sustain and nourish the human body. Now, a charity auction of drawings by some of the most glittering names in art – including Tracey Emin, Antony Gormley and Anish Kapoor – is helping raise funds so that these high-tech Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Foods (RTUF) can stop children dying of starvation in Africa. The liquid food – which contains protein, fats, carbohydrates and a complete spectrum of 26 essential vitamins and minerals – was originally developed to tackle undernourishment. And money raised from this week’s auction at Christie’s will go towards using the packs in the way they were first intended. They are made by Valid Nutrition, a firm that sources ingredients where possible from indigenous producers and the local community. VN was established in 2007 by a single man with a passion: Dr Steve Collins MBE.

A little girl's headless body was exhumed from a Missouri cemetery thirty years after she was found murdered in an abandoned apartment building in St. Louis. 'Jane Doe', believed to be between eight and 11-years-old, was exhumed last week with the hope that she might finally be identified and her killer brought to justice, KTVI reported. Crews exhumed her body from Washington Park Cemetery in Berkeley, Mo., on June 17 after researchers and police spent months looking for her unmarked grave. Evidence: 'Little Jane Doe', aged eight to 11, was found decapitated, bound and naked except for this bloody yellow sweater in February 1983 . Found: The girl's remains were exhumed after an exhaustive search for her grave by investigators, volunteers and researchers, seen here . This at least the second time . authorities have attempted to exhume the girl, but her remains weren't . in their listed location due to the cemetery's neglect, KTVI reported. A 23-year-old research associate at . Washington University's Department of Computer Science & Engineering . reignited the effort to identify Jane Doe. Abby Stylianou told FoxNews.com that . the girl's grave was unmarked. In order to find her body, Stylianou's . team used newspaper photos from the girl's funeral and aerial images . from the U.S. Geological Survey to pinpoint the burial spot. 'We were given access to eight photos . taken on the day she was buried,' she told FoxNews.com. 'There were . trees and headstones that we know haven't moved.' After digging for five hours, volunteers, experts from Washington University and the University of Notre Dame, the St. Louis City Medical Examiner's Office and police found a small, 55-inch wood casket containing what they believed are the girl's remains, according to KSDK. Tests: Jane Doe's body was exhumed in an effort to finally identify her with modern technology and break the cold case . Lost: Jane Doe's headstone, paid for by University of Washington Students, left, was placed on the wrong burial site, making her exhumation difficult . Her body was taken to the medical examiner's office for DNA tests after it was found, but it could take weeks before tests might shed light on grisly cold case. On Feb. 28, 1983, the girl's body was originally found by two men looking for scrap metal in a boarded-up apartment building in north St. Louis. The men found the headless child in a dark furnace room lying on her stomach, hands bound behind her back with red and white nylon rope and naked except for a bloody yellow sweater without its tag. Police believe she was sexually assaulted before being strangled to death and decapitated with a long-bladed knife. 'We never had a child killed like that,' Joe Burgoon, a 43-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department who was among the first detectives at the scene after the two men called police, told FoxNews.com. 'I thought about her every time I drove by that cemetery.' The girl, known as 'Little Jane Doe' and 'Hope', was never identified. Forensic anthologists could only determine that she was African American and tall for her age. Police never arrested any suspects and investigators couldn't match her description to missing children at the time, according to FoxNews.com. Murdered: Two men found the unidentified girl's body in this abandoned house in north St. Louis. Police believe she was sexually assaulted, strangled and then decapitated . Because no one in the state reported her missing, investigators believe she wasn't from Missouri. Scientists will examine minerals in her bones to try to determine what part of the country she came from, but police think her killer was a local resident. 'He had to be familiar with the area,' Burgoon told FoxNews.com. 'It's possible she was killed by a relative or someone she knew because her head was taken off.' 'But who knows what these killers think,' Burgoon added. 'Anything is possible. It could have been a stranger.' Burgoon, who was among those at the cemetery last week when the girl's body was exhumed, said the sweater she was found in seemed to be new. Police don't think she was killed at the apartment because there 'wasn't much blood at the scene'. Investigation: A car takes the casket holding the body of a decapitated girl police believe was murdered in 1983 to the St. Louis City Medical Examiner's Office for tests to determine her identity . 'Whoever carried her brushed against the wall and there were little streaks of blood,' Burgoon said. Police couldn't tie her body to any reports of child abuse, either: X-rays showed no trauma, broken bones or scars. Upon finding the casket, the University of Washington researcher, Stylianou, said she was both sad and hopeful. 'I felt an overwhelming sense of sadness about what got her to that point,' she told FoxNews.com. 'But now there's hope we can figure out who she was.' A volunteer with the exhumation effort said he was relieved. 'We found her. I just praise God we found her,' Freddie Jefferson told KTVI. 'I hope they can find the DNA to figure out who she belonged to and catch who did it.'","Known as 'Little Jane Doe' and 'Hope', police believe the girl was sexually assaulted, strangled and beheaded before she was found in February 1983 .

"By . Anthony Bond  and Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:13 EST, 21 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:33 EST, 22 June 2013 . The Justice Department has charged former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden with espionage and theft of government property in the NSA surveillance case. Officials have also asked the Hong Kong authorities to extradite the former government contracter who leaked the details of the NSA's top secret PRISM data collection programme. Snowden, believed to be holed up in Hong Kong, has admitted providing information to the news media about two highly classified NSA surveillance programs. A one-page criminal complaint unsealed Friday in federal court in Alexandria, Va., says Snowden engaged in unauthorized communication of national defense information and willful communication of classified communications intelligence information. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has been charged with espionage and theft and U.S. officials are seeking his extradition from Hong Kong . Both are charges under the Espionage Act. Snowden also is charged with theft of government property. All three crimes carry a maximum 10-year prison penalty. The federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia where the complaint was filed is headquarters for Snowden's former employer, government contractor Booz Allen Hamilton. The complaint is dated June 14, five days after Snowden's name first surfaced as the leaker of information about the two programs in which the NSA gathered telephone and Internet records to ferret out terror plots. The complaint could become an integral part of a U.S. government effort to have Snowden extradited from Hong Kong, a process that could turn into a prolonged legal battle. Snowden could contest extradition on grounds of political persecution. In general, the extradition agreement between the U.S. and Hong Kong excepts political offenses from the obligation to turn over a person. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, welcomed the charges. 'I've always thought this was a treasonous act,' he said in a statement. 'I hope Hong Kong's government will take him into custody and extradite him to the U.S.' Helping hand: WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn . Hrafnsson, left, approached Iceland on behalf of Snowden and his . middleman. Julian Assange, right, also sought help from Iceland ahead of . Wikileaks' releases . Iceland has a reputation for . promoting internet freedoms and has long been discussed as an option for Snowden. As a U.S. citizen, Snowden would not need a visa to enter Iceland and could immediately apply for asylum. He would be free to live in Iceland while immigration authorities decide his case, which could take more than a year, experts have said. But if Snowden wants to seek refuge in Iceland, he'll have to get there first. And this is where the U.S. could have a chance. Interpol will sometimes issue a 'red notice' - which is like an international arrest warrant - but keep it sealed so that the person doesn't know it exists. If he tried to travel, he would be arrested at the airport. If he did get to Iceland, it is unknown if he would be safe. The government of newly-elected Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson is believed to be closer to Washington than past administrations and less keen to foster the country's cyber-haven image. 'I would be very surprised if they (the government) would be eager to engage in any international disputes with the U.S. And it is pretty difficult to be granted asylum here,' Stefania Oskarsdottir, lecturer in political science at the University of Iceland, told Reuters. 'I think what this guy is saying is based on something he is imagining or hoping for rather than actual facts.' Iceland does have an extradition treaty with . the United States, but it is unclear if it would cover any crimes . that he might be charged with. Michael di Pretoro, a retired 30-year . veteran with the FBI who served from 1990 to 1994 as the legal liaison . officer at the American consulate in Hong Kong, said 'relations between . U.S. and Hong Kong law enforcement personnel are historically quite . good.' 'In my time, I felt the degree of . cooperation was outstanding to the extent that I almost felt I was in an . FBI field office,' said di Pretoro. The U.S. and Hong Kong cooperate on law enforcement matters and have a standing agreement on the surrender of fugitives. However, Snowden's appeal rights could drag out any extradition proceeding. The success or failure of any . extradition proceeding depends on what the suspect is charged with under . U.S. law and how it corresponds to Hong Kong law under the treaty. In . order for Hong Kong officials to honor the extradition request, they . have to have some applicable statute under their law that corresponds . with a violation of U.S. law. News of the charges broke on Friday . evening, the same day it emerged that Snowden could be flown to Iceland . from Hong Kong by the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks. A businessman connected to the . controversial website said a chartered private jet is ready for the . 30-year-old, who fled to Hong Kong after leaking U.S security details. It comes after Iceland admitted holding talks with Snowden . over the possibility of seeking political asylum. Olafur Sigurvinsson, head of DataCell, which handles donations to Wikileaks, revealed details of the private jet. Speaking to Channel2 television, he said: 'Everything is ready on our side and the plane could take off tomorrow. 'We have really done all we can do. We have a plane and all the logistics in place.' The jet is believed to belong to a Chinese firm and has been chartered at a cost of $240,000. WikiLeaks . founder Julian Assange revealed on Wednesday he had been in contact . with Snowden's representatives to discuss his possible bid for asylum in . Iceland. The former US government contractor fled to Hong Kong on May 20 after leaking National Security Agency programs. It also emerged that a contractor for the National Security Agency found possible . discrepancies in a resume submitted by Edward Snowden, but the company . still employed him, a source said . on Thursday. Snowden was hired this spring after . he convinced his hiring screeners at Booz Allen Hamilton, that his . description of his education was truthful. It is unclear precisely which element . of Snowden's resume caused personnel officials at Booz Allen Hamilton . to raise questions about his background. Also unclear is how he . satisfied their concerns. Booz Allen Hamilton has said in a . statement that 'we will work closely with our clients and authorities in . their investigation of this matter.' Snowden fled his home in Hawaii, where he worked for NSA contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, after exposing the U.S. government's top surveillance secrets. He is at a secret location in Hong Kong. In . a column in Icelandic daily newspaper Frettabladid, WikiLeaks spokesman . Kristinn Hrafnsson wrote that a middleman had approached him on behalf . of Snowden. 'On 2 June, I received a message from Edward Snowden where he asked me to . notify the Icelandic government that he wanted to seek asylum in . Iceland,' Hrafnsson, who is also an investigative journalist in Iceland, . told Reuters. Support: Snowden's image is displayed in Hong Kong, where the whistleblower is currently in hiding . He added . that he has yet to receive a response from officials about his request . but said they have a 'moral obligation' to answer the call for help. The . Icelandic government, which has refused to say whether they would grant . asylum to Snowden, confirmed it had received the message from . Hrafnsson. 'Kristinn Hrafnsson has contacted two ministries in an informal way but not the ministers,' a government spokesman said. 'There has been no formal approach in this matter.' Hrafnsson would not identify who the middleman was. Snowden has previously mentioned Iceland as a possible refuge. Iceland has a reputation for . promoting Internet freedoms, but Snowden has said did not travel there . immediately from the United States as he feared the country could be . pressured by Washington. 'Iceland . could be pushed harder, quicker, before the public could have a chance . to make their feelings known, and I would not put that past the current . U.S. administration,' Snowden said in an online forum in the Guardian on . Monday. It had been . suggested that he would actually flee to the Icelandic consulate in Hong . Kong, rather than risking boarding a plane to fly there in person. Safety: Iceland has a reputation for promoting internet freedoms. Reykjavik is pictured . Icelandic officials told USA Today last week that Snowden is missing a key element. 'The main stipulation for seeking . asylum in Iceland would be that the person must be in Iceland to start . the process,' said Johannes Tomasson, the chief spokesman for Iceland's . Ministry of Interior in Reykjavik. 'That would be the ground rule No. 1.' WikiLeaks founder . Julian Assange, who is holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London to . avoid extradition to Sweden for questioning over allegations of sex . crimes, visited Iceland several times in the run-up to some of the . website's major releases. Assange denies any wrongdoing. Yet some experts added that Iceland might not be as welcoming as Snowden hopes. The government of newly-elected Prime . Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson has not been tested in relation to these cases, but is believed to be closer to . Washington than past administrations and less keen to foster the . country's cyber-haven image. 'I would be very surprised if they .

"By . Eddie Wrenn . UPDATED: . 12:17 EST, 14 September 2012 . Huge, ugly and cluttered, it is almost the antithesis of Apple's iconic design style. Apple has almost finished work on a massive solar farm next to its data centre in North Carolina, hoping to boost its green credentials - but scarring the landscape with a 100-acre eyesore at the same time. Organisations such as Greenpeace have, . in the past, accused Apple of hurting the environment by using coal to . power these centres. Apple's data centres keep the world's iPhones running - syncing contacts to the 'iCloud' and storing a wealth of information on each user. Scale of the enterprise: The solar farm (foreground) dwarfs Apple's data farm (background) Panels on a tracker: As the sun moves, the farm moves with it, rotating around to keep the panel facing sun-wards . Apple is just one of many companie pumping millions if not billions of dollars into data centres. Google has spent $600million on a centre in Lenoir - about an hour's drive from Apple's centre in Maiden. Drive for another hour, and you bump into Facebook's 300,000sq ft centre, in a place called Forest City. It has led to large investment within the state, as well as offering jobs and opportunities. According to ComputerWorld, the reason why 'NC' is such a popular spot lies partly down to it's strong electrical grid, and tax breaks. Apple has allegedly received a 10-year 50 per cent break in real estate taxes and an 85 per cent break in personal property taxes. The state also has a strong record for making quick decisions on permits - and plenty of room for expansion. When completed, Apple’s 100-acre, . 20-megawatt facility will supply 42 million kWh of energy annually, and . is expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars to construct. The area is also home to Facebook and Google data centers, attracted by the cheap power costs. As reported by website GigaOm, the North Carolina TV station WCNC flew past the solar farm, taking these images and showing the scale of the farm. Which means that every time you upload an image or make a pithy announcement of your life on Facebook, the servers in North Carolina are chugging away to ensure your messages get sent. While sending messages around the . world virtually might make more eco-sense than physically getting a . plane to do it in person, critics, such as British site MusicTank, . suggest the way we use clouds for our data may be more damaging to the . environment. Report author Dagfinn Bach said: 'Streaming . or downloading 12 tracks, without compression, just 27 times by one . user would, in energy terms, equate to the production and shipping of . one physical 12-track CD album' Each . panel in the farm is installed on a tracker, which keeps everything . pointing at the sun, scooping up as much of the Californian rays as . possible. Row after row: The solar farm keeps the iCloud alive for users, which follows protests from Greenpeace about previous non-ecological practices . Apple has been fairly quiet about the farm, but according to publications such as Wired and GigaOm, it is very close to completion. The company also appears to building a 4.8-megawatt array of 'Bloom Energy' fuel cells, which convert bio-gas into electricity. Other companies in California including Google, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft are also looking to combine data and solar power centres. From 2007 to 2011, carbon emissions with the Apple TV were reduced by 90 per cent. The iMac has also seen a 50 per cent reduction from 1998 to 2011, while the Mac mini has dropped 52 per cent. Apple has also reduced the packaging associated with the iPhone by 42 per cent from 2007 to 2011. That . allows the company to ship 80 per cent more boxes in each airline . shipping container, saving one 747 flight for every 371,250 boxes Apple . ships.","Solar farm dwarfs Apple's data centre, which supports services such as iCloud .

Britain’s most reluctant bride who spent 40 years rejecting her partner’s marriage proposals finally married him and joked: 'I’m worth the wait.' Ann Turner, 72, repeatedly turned Chris Green down every time he popped the question until she finally said ‘yes’ on his 75th birthday. And yesterday she walked down the aisle when she and Chris were married at St Matthews Church in Harlaston, Staffs. Meant to be: Ann Turner was reluctant to marry boyfriend Chris Green, saying marriage was 'just a piece of paper' but when she finally did walk down the aisle said she was 'thrilled' - and joked she was 'worth the wait' Ann, who arrived at the church in a gold-coloured Rolls Royce, said: 'It’s been a lovely day and Chris has never looked more handsome. 'I'm thrilled he kept persisting and asking me to marry him. 'It’s been a lovely day for us and our family. 'He keeps saying to me ‘I knew you’d marry me one day’ I just tell him ‘I’m worth the wait.' Chris and Ann first met at the Alrewas British Legion Club in Staffordshire in 1973 and hit it off almost straight away. Ann’s first husband had left her for another woman a year earlier and Chris’s first wife had died of cancer when he was only 32. After a few months Chris plucked up the courage to propose but Ann turned him down because she didn’t feel ready. Optimistic: Chris Green, 75 said he knew Ann would accept eventually. For her part, Ann said she was 'thrilled' he kept persisting . Determined: Retired miner Chris whisked care worker Ann on multiple romantic weekends in an attempt to seduce her into saying yes - but was never successful until now . Ann, a retired care worker, also told Chris getting married was just a “pointless piece of paper” but agreed to move in with him. Over the next 40 years Chris popped the question hundreds of times and even carried around an engagement ring in his pocket in case Ann changed her mind. Retired miner Chris spent thousands of pounds taking Ann away on romantic weekend breaks and showering her with flowers and gifts - but her answer was always ‘no’. Devoted: Chris proposed hundreds of times over the four decades the two were together - and carried an engagement ring with him at all times in case Ann changed her mind . But yesterday Chris said he was 'delighted' to have finally married Ann. He said: “It might have taken me 40 years to make an honest woman of her but she’s worth it.'I love her dearly and always knew she was the one. 'I’m glad we’ve finally done it and I don’t have to carry that engagement ring around with me anymore.' Soulmates: 'I love her dearly and always knew she was the one,' said Chris .

Double pay: Andrea Stark remained on a £100k-a-year salary while working outside the Arts Council . A senior manager at the Arts Council is to leave the organisation next week with a six-figure redundancy cheque after taking a six-month paid sabbatical. Andrea Stark has been allowed to work for an outside organisation while still picking up her £100,000-a-year salary from the quango that distributes public money to the arts. The sabbatical leave has meant she has qualified for a redundancy payment of at least £100,000 because the Arts Council is abolishing her job next month. Miss Stark would not have been entitled to a redundancy payment had she resigned last autumn to take up her new role in charge of High House Production Park, a largely taxpayer-funded enterprise that makes sets for the Royal Opera House. The deal means Miss Stark will have been paid close to £200,000 by the Arts Council since she left the organisation last autumn. She is understood to have been on annual leave, on full pay, between October and the beginning of this year, when the paid sabbatical period started. However her real job for the past eight months has been chief executive of High House, which is heavily funded by public money. Her appointment as chief executive of High House was announced last autumn by Tony Hall, now BBC director general but then chief executive of the Royal Opera House and chairman of High House. Miss Stark has not been paid by High House since last October. But one of her first actions in the new job was to join a party which made a taxpayer-funded visit to Rio de Janeiro and Salvador in Brazil ‘to create new dialogues about social and personal transformation through the arts’. Miss Stark began working at London's Royal Opera House while on sabbatical leave from the Arts Council . The arrangement for Miss Stark drew condemnation from taxpayer pressure groups. Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘This is another example of the Arts Council squandering public money.’ The deal is likely to prove embarrassing to Mr Hall as well as to Arts Council chairman Sir Peter Bazalgette and the minister in charge of the Government department that pays for the Council, Culture  Secretary Maria Miller. Miss Stark, who began her career as a community theatre director in London, joined the Arts Council in 1999. Among grants it announced last year were £10million for the Royal Opera House and £1million for the High House operation. The Arts Council said Miss Stark was entitled to a sabbatical as part of a long-standing contract. A spokesman said: ‘We are not able to publish an individual’s redundancy payment until after they have been made. This is because until the final payment is made the calculations are subject to change.’","Andrea Stark began new job during sabbatical from Arts Council .

As a singer, actress, dancer and TV presenter, Denise Van Outen can turn her hand to many a task. But these pictures show the star enjoying her most cherished role of all; that of mother to her adorable three-year-old Betsy. Denise looked incredible in a blue and white bikini as she splashed in the surf with her daughter on a sunshine break in Majorca. Model mum: Denise Van Outen showed off her incredible bikini body during a holiday in Malllorca with her daughter Betsy . The presenter, who took part in the most recent series of Strictly Come Dancing, showed off a trim frame and a glowing tan. Her blonde hair was loose and Denise wore a beaming smile as she played with Betsy - her daughter with husband Lee Mead - in the shallow water. Betsy looked cute as a button in her bright red swimming costume, with her curls tied up in a ponytail. Just the two of us: Denise was not joined by husband Lee Mead but her little girl . Rumours: The pictures come as Denise and Lee have both denied their marriage is on the rocks . Not a care in the world: The TV star looked in very high spirits as she spent quality time with her daughter . Tanned and toned: Denise revealed a very impressive figure as she took to the sand in her bikini . Denise shared the endearing holiday snaps - including one of her laughing in delight as Betsy playfully flings some sand towards her - on her Twitter page. Another shot showed the star smiling down at the three-year-old as she held her tight in the waters of the Mediterranean. The doting mother was also seen holding on to her little girl's bucket and spades while they made their way along the shore. Messing about: The star and her daughter couldn't stop laughing as they relaxed on the sand . Matching: As Betsy sat on her mother's knees she mimicked her facial expression . Relaxed: Denise certainly looked like she was enjoying herself under the sun . And after a while the mother and daughter take a seat in the sand and start building castles together, giggling throughout. The sight of the girls enjoying quality time together as a twosome is becoming increasingly familiar amid rumours over the state of Denise's marriage to West End star Lee Mead - although the pair have insisted that all is well with their relationship. The couple put on a show of unity at the launch of 31-year-old Lee's new show The West End Men earlier this month. Keeping her entertained: Denise looked intent on ensuring her little girl had a great holiday . Building things: The pair sat on the sand and began building a castle . Earlier this year Denise was spotted holidaying on her own but insisted this was just because they did not employ a nanny so were forced to do things separately. Speaking to Daybreak at the time she said: 'There's always speculation. Just to set the record straight, we don't have a nanny, so we split our parenting duties, so we do spend time apart. 'If we had a nanny and we went away all the time together then people would critcise us for not taking our child with us. Betsy's in nursery, do you know what I mean?' Fling: Denise laughed as Betsy chucked sand on her washboard stomach . Mummy dearest: Betsy looked so happy to be spending quality time with her mother . Red, blue and white: The mother and daughter looked chic in their complimentary swimwear combos . The pictures of mother and daughter emerged after Denise enjoyed a visit to No 10 Downing Street earlier this month at the invitation of the Prime Minister's wife Samantha Cameron. Proud Denise tweeted a picture of her invitation to her followers, joking: 'The first invitation I've had in a while that doesn't say ""bring a bottle""!'

A study found that a taking a probiotic supplement boosted levels of the vitamin by more than 25 per cent. It is the first evidence that probiotics play a role in maintaining levels of the bone-strengthening nutrient. Taking a probiotic supplement boosts a person's levels of Vitamin D - the sunshine vitamin - by more than 25 per cent . Previous studies have shown the effect of the particular strain of a probiotic, called Lactobacillus reuteri NCIMB 30242, on . cholesterol reduction, but its effect on the absorption of fat-soluble . vitamins such as Vitamin D was unknown. Researchers investigated the effects of the probiotics after a supplement had been taken by a group of adults for nine weeks. They tested levels of Vitamin D by monitoring levels of  25-hydroxyvitamin D in the blood. Vitamin D levels are of increasing concern as the numbers of children developing rickets, and the number of adults developing osteoporosis, increases. Insufficient Vitamin D contributes to these conditions by reducing calcium absorption, and by in turn weakening the bones. Researchers are also beginning to discover links between Vitamin D levels and protection . against heart disease, autoimmune diseases and diabetes. This is the first evidence that probiotics (pictured) play a role in maintaining the body's levels of the bone-strengthening vitamin . A variety of factors . may reduce Vitamin D absorption, including limited exposure to sunlight, . dark skin, obesity, and problems with absorption or ability to convert Vitamin D to its active form. 'This study is adding to the body . of knowledge on the microbiome (the community of bacteria in the gut) command and its role in human health,' said Dr . Jones, lead study author and chief scientific officer at probiotic company Micropharma . Limited. 'Although it has long been known that the gastrointestinal . tract plays an active role in the absorption of Vitamin D, these . findings showing improved Vitamin D status in response to an orally . delivered probiotic are a first, and will inform the development of new . products that may be beneficial for people with low Vitamin D levels.'

The 400-year-old chapel in which the Bronte sisters were baptised has been desecrated by stone thieves. Crowbar-wielding looters ripped up two 200-year-old burial slabs from the graveyard, wrenched stones from the chapel walls, and tore up part of the nearby Bronte Way footpath. It is feared that they will have thrown away the irreplaceable marked gravestones when they realised they were among their haul of valuable York stone. Desecrated: Bare earth is exposed where thieves tore up a Yorkshire stone burial slab outside by the old bell chapel in Thornton, West Yorkshire . Volunteers have worked for 12 years to restore the cemetery and Grade Two-listed 'Bronte Bell Chapel', next to St James' Parish Church in the village of Thornton, near Bradford, West Yorkshire. Although the Brontes are more closely associated with the Parsonage a few miles away in Haworth they were actually born in Thornton where their clergyman father had his living from 1815 to 1820. All three of the literary sisters and their brother Branwell were baptised in the chapel, where their father Patrick Bronte preached his first sermon about the Duke of Wellington’s 1815 victory over Napoleon at Waterloo. Organised: It would have taken four men to carry away the two 200-year-old burial slabs . Irreplaceable: The slabs bore inscriptions that were much more detailed than those on the headstones themselves . Patrick once described his years . in Thornton as 'the happiest in his life', before the family was torn . apart by the premature deaths of its literary prodigies. On Saturday, members of the action group set up to restore the site came along to tend the graveyard - and discovered thousands of pounds of damage. Thieves had removed two horizontal grave . slabs measuring six foot long by three foot wide and four inches thick - . which would take four men to lift. Greedy: The looters also took pieces of stone from fifteen other graves, and paving slabs from the Bronte Way, a footpath linking Bronte landmarks across Yorkshire . Search: There are concerns that the thieves will have dumped the slabs once they realise their significance . They had also taken slabs from the Bronte Way, a footpath linking points of interest across the moorland that inspired Wuthering Heights. One of the graves marked the final resting place of tragic John and Mary Pickles and the five children who predeceased them in the 1820s. The other stone covered the plot of Hannah and James Abbott and their 28-year-old daughter Mary who were all dead by 1828. The thieves did not touch the actual headstones, but the inscriptions on the slabs were more extensive. Pieces of York stone had also been removed from the top of 15 other graves. Coping stones had been ripped from the chapel itself and much of the churchyard footpath torn up. Restored: Local volunteers had been working hard to restore the 'Bronte' bell chapel (pictured), of St James Church in Thornton . Historic: The Bronte children were baptised in the chapel (pictured as it was), where their father Patrick was clergyman . Yesterday the attack was roundly condemned by the local people who had worked tirelessly to restore the site, West Yorkshire Police, and civic leaders. Churchwarden Steven Stanworth, the mastermind of the chapel restoration, was sickened. 'We are proud of our achievements in making Bronte Bell Chapel and surrounding graveyard a place where people can now visit to enjoy its history, beauty and nature. Literary genius: Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte (left) and Wuthering Heights by Emily (right) are two of the greatest works of nineteenth-century English literature . 'It is a historic site and it has been desecrated. This was a despicable and awful crime. Thousands of pounds of stone have been stolen and the graves are irreplaceable. 'The thieves probably dumped them in a hedge or threw them over a wall once they realised there were inscriptions which made them identifiable. 'The action group of nine volunteers have put a lot of hard work in and are devastated. Family: The Tenant of Wildfell Hall by Anne Bronte (left) is still popular today. Patrick Bronte (right) was parson in Thornton between 1815 and 1820 . 'It is absolutely disgraceful and disgusting. The morons who did this must be sick and have no respect for life, death or social history.' 'We were celebrating 400 years of its history this year and it has taken the edge off it.' The graveyard was the final resting place of many local worthies before the last plot was filled in 1965. The Brontes were one of the most important families in English literary history. Sisters . Charlotte, Emily and Anne all began to write at an early age at their . home in Haworth, West Yorkshire. Their stories started as a game based . around brother Branwell's toy soldiers. Charlotte's Jane Eyre and Emily's Wuthering Heights are regarded as classics of English literature. Anne's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall remains a huge bestseller. Emily . and Anne both died of tuberculosis in 1848-9 aged 30 and 29 . respectively. Branwell and Charlotte were also killed by the disease. Their . deaths added to the heartbreak of clergyman father Patrick Bronte, who . had already lost two younger children to tuberculosis and his wife to . cancer. The gates are left unlocked to allow their ancestors to pay their respects and for families to enjoy the peace and quiet. The churchwarden added: 'What has happened has been devastating. The two graves taken are over 200 years old and were irreplaceable. It’s totally sad. 'Local stonemasons have been contacted but they do not hold out much hope of getting them back.' Police patrols were stepped up around St James' Church on Thornton Road after the damage was discovered. Detective Inspector Mark Long said: 'This is quite clearly a despicable act which will cause great offence in the local community. 'Police are aware of the theft of Yorkshire stone and these gravestones from the church and have been in contact with officials there. 'Unfortunately, there are no positive lines of inquiry at this time despite investigations. 'So we appeal to anyone who has information and furthermore, to any local stonemasons who are offered what are clearly gravestones to contact us.' Councillor Susan Hinchcliffe, Bradford Council’s portfolio holder for tourism, described the sacrilege as 'sickening'. She added: 'The Old Bell Chapel has a strong significance to the Bronte story, and is a major tourist draw for the Bradford district. People who commit these crimes throw away hundreds of years of history.'","Thieves steal grave slabs and paving stones from Old Bell Chapel in Thornton, West Yorkshire .

British adults today are more self-obsessed and worry more about their daily lives than those who lived through the Blitz, a new book claims. This is despite the fact they don't have to worry about bombs, blackouts and rationing, says psychologist Graham Price. He adds that today’s adults spend twice as much time fretting about their lives as those who lived through the Blitz. British adults today are self-obsessed . and 'consumed' with negative thoughts about their own personal problems from work and money to relationships, a psychologist has claimed . The book, The Promise, also claims that Britons have forgotten how to 'look on the bright side of life'. Mr Price suggests the poster, Keep Calm and Carry On, would have worked during the Second World War but has less effect today, despite the slogan's recent resurrection. The problem is that today's adults are 'consumed' with negative thoughts about their own personal problems from work and money to relationships, he believes. In contrast, during the war there was a more positive attitude because it helped people to deal with what were much more serious problems all around them, said Mr Price. Psychologist Graham Price claims we now worry more about our daily lives than those who lived through the Blitz (pictured in Birmingham) - and are also more stressed and likely to have anxiety problems . His book, described as ‘a handbook for personal development’, is based on his analysis of several hundred patients he has treated for stress or anxiety related issues. From having a 'wartime spirit' while bombs were falling all around them in the 1940s, Britons now suffer from a 'stress epidemic', he said. Mr Price suggests the poster, Keep Calm and Carry On, would have worked during the Second World War but has less effect today . He added: ‘There's no doubt that people in war-torn Britain were seriously concerned about all manner of things, from the threat of invasion down to the state of their personal finance. ‘Yet records show they were able to keep things in perspective, which often meant looking on the bright side - even at the most difficult of times. ‘Resilience was then a cornerstone of the British character. ‘Modern Britons, on the other hand, are consumed with anxiety, most of which is brought on by non-life-threatening issues like employment, finance and relationships. ‘Compared to the war, we've never had it so good - but based on anxiety levels you wouldn't know it.’ Stress is now the most common reason for absence from work and has also been linked with increased rates of associated illnesses from dementia to high blood pressure, he said. The positive attitudes of wartime Britons has led to Mr Price drawing up a stress-busting programme called Acceptance Action Training. It encourages the Churchillian 'indomitable spirit' of the Second World War in dealing with problems and how to develop a positive attitude. Mr Price said: ‘Maintaining a realistic, positive attitude to the problems that come our way got Britain through its darkest days. ‘Winston Churchill was the perfect embodiment of this. ‘He didn't waste time and energy dwelling on problems but instead accepted the situation and looked to what could be done to improve things going forward.’","Psychologist Graham Price says British adults today are more self-obsessed .

Nearly one in four patients who suffer a stroke or heart attack go on to experience symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a study has found. Previously thought of as a condition which only affected soldiers or victims of traumatic events such as assualt, the research shows PTSD is much more far reaching. The findings suggest that nearly 300,000 survivors of strokes or heart attacks will develop symptoms of PTSD as a result of their health scare every year in the U.S. alone. The research, carried out by Columbia University Medical Center, also found suffering from PTSD also doubles a patient's chance of future heart attack and of death within three years. Donald Edmondson, assistant professor of behavioral medicine at CUMC, said: 'PTSD is common among heart attack survivors and it contributes to a doubled risk of a future cardiac event or of dying within one to three years. 'Our current results show that PTSD in stroke and TIA [heart attack] survivors may increase their risk for recurrent stroke and other cardiovascular events. 'Given that each event is life-threatening and that strokes/TIAs add hundreds of millions of dollars to annual health expenditures, these findings are important to both the long-term survival and health costs of these patient populations.' PTSD is an anxiety disorder caused by exposure to a traumatic event. Common symptoms include nightmares, avoidance of reminders of the event, and elevated heart rate and blood pressure. Chronic PTSD is when these symptoms persist for three months or longer. Researchers at CUMC believe this study, on 1,138 stroke or heart attack survivors, is the first time research has been carried out into PTSD caused by strokes or heart attacks. Findings: PTSD has previously been primarily associated with soldiers or victims of traumatic events but new research by Columbia University Medical Centre has highlighted that many victims of stroke go on to suffer the disorder . According to data from the American Stroke Association, nearly 795,000 suffer a new or recurrent stroke in the U.S. every year with a further 500,000 suffering a heart attack. The study shows that around 23 per cent of sufferers will go on to develop PTSD symptoms within a year of their stroke or heart attack, with one in nine suffering chronic PTSD more than a year on. Ian Kronish, assistant professor of medicine at CUMC, said: 'PTSD is not just a disorder of combat veterans and sexual assault survivors, but strongly affects survivors of stroke and other potentially traumatic acute cardiovascular events as well. 'PTSD and other psychological disorders in stroke and TIA patients appear to be an under-recognized and undertreated problem. 'Surviving a life-threatening health scare can have a debilitating psychological impact, and health care providers should make it a priority to screen for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD among these patient populations.' The study was published in the online edition of PLOS ONE.","PTSD is an anxiety disorder caused by traumatic events and is common in soldiers and victims of assault and rape .

A deadly new virus that has emerged in the Middle East is thought to be more dangerous than SARS after it killed 38 people in a year. More than 60 cases of MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) have been reported in the last year by the World Health Organisation. Many of those who have the disease, which can spread easily between people, were in Saudi Arabia, reported Fox News. Doctors are worried after the new MERS disease showed the potential to become as deadly as SARS . There was a global outbreak of SARS in 2003, killing 800 people, and some experts note the resemblances between the two as both spread easily between hospitals. Symptoms are also similar with a fever and cough that develops into pneumonia. But, doctors note that the fatality rate is higher. Eight per cent of SARS patients died, while 65 per cent of MERS cases are believed to have been fatal. However, the illness so far has not spread as quickly as SARS did. Dr. Trish Perl a senior hospital epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Medicine said that she thought it was a lot like SARS. Most cases of the disease have been recorded in Saudi Arabia, which expects millions of Muslin pilgrims to visit next month during Ramadan . She added: ‘In the right circumstances, the spread could be explosive.’ Doctors have not been able to pinpoint exactly how the illness is spread in every case, as some appeared to catch it when they had not been in contact with an infected person. MERS cases have also been reported in Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Tunisia. But, most cases have been in Saudi Arabia, which is set to receive millions of Muslim pilgrims during Ramadan next month. Dr. Clemens Wendtner, who treated a . MERS patient who later died in Munich, said: ‘We need more information . from other countries to find out what the best treatment is. ‘Our patient got everything possible and it still didn't help him.’ Previous outbreaks of SARS around the world have caused deaths, spreading panic and alarm . Experts say that despite the small number of cases, MERS must be watched as it has the potential to cause an outbreak. WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan  said: ‘We understand too little about this virus when viewed against the magnitude of its potential threat.’ WHO is set to meet in Cairo next month to discuss MERS and its potential threat.","MERS has had 60 cases and killed 38 people in the last year .

"By . Jessica Satherley . UPDATED: . 10:21 EST, 2 September 2011 . Warnings: The UN fears the mutant bird flu virus could spread this winter . Fears of a resurgence of the deadly bird flu virus have been raised by the United Nations, saying wild bird migrations had brought it back to previously virus-free countries. A mutant strain of the disease is said to be spreading through Asia and at least eight people have died in Cambodia this year of bird flu. The new strain of the H5N1 virus is spreading in China and Vietnam and can apparently sidestep defences of existing vaccines, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation said in a statement yesterday. It urged greater surveillance to ensure that any outbreaks are contained, although it is still uncertain though whether the mutant virus can be passed on to humans. Last week, the World Health Organization reported that a six-year-old Cambodian girl had died on August 14 from bird flu, the eighth person to die from H5N1 avian influenza in the country this year. Vietnam suspended its springtime poultry vaccination this year, FAO said. Most of the northern and central parts of the country where the virus is endemic have been invaded by the new strain. Elsewhere, FAO says bird migrations over the past two years have brought H5N1 to countries that had been virus-free for several years, including Israel, the Palestinian territories, Bulgaria, Romania, Nepal and Mongolia. ‘Wild birds may introduce the virus, but people's actions in poultry production and marketing spread it,’ said FAO's chief veterinary office Juan Lubroth in urging greater preparedness and surveillance. WHO says globally there have been 331 human deaths from 565 confirmed bird flu cases since 2003 when it was first detected. The virus was eliminated from most of the 63 countries infected at its peak in 2006, but it remained endemic in six countries: Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia and Vietnam. The number of outbreaks in poultry and wild bird populations shrank from a high of 4000 to 302 in mid-2008, but outbreaks have risen progressively since, with almost 800 cases reported in 2010-2011, FAO said. Leading microbiologist, Professor Hugh Pennington (pictured) has warned that Tamiflu may now be useless . ‘The general departure from the progressive decline in 2004-2008 could mean that there will be a flare-up of H5N1 this fall and winter, with people unexpectedly finding the virus in their backyard,’ Lubroth said in a statement. But leading microbiologist, Professor Hugh Pennington, says that while there is no evidence that the flu is yet mutating to spread from person to person it is a 'reasonable speculation' that it has become resistant to Tamiflu - the main drug used in the UK to fight the virus. The British and Scottish Governments spent over £100m on over 50 million doses of Tamiflu - enough for 80 per cent of the population . The emeritus professor of bacteriology at Aberdeen University had warned last year that deadly flu pandemics with special antiviral drugs could create an even more dangerous, untreatable 'superflu' after the UK expanded anti-viral stocks from 35 million to 50 million. The Scottish government's effort to combat a possible pandemic is also heavily reliant on Tamiflu, an oral drug produced by the Swiss manufacturer Roche, despite warnings that it may be ineffective. ""Tamiflu should only be given to high risk cases. I think it is a reasonable speculation to make - given the new reports - that Tamiflu has been handed out inappropriately and the virus has developed a resistance to it. If that is the case that would mean that the UK's stocks of the drug would be largely ineffective,' said Professor Pennington. 'The idea that Tamiflu was a cure-all was plainly wrong. 'There is no need to panic yet because there is no evidence that the virus is spreading person to person and there are other anti-virals - such as Relenza - that do have an effect. 'There is also no evidence that the virus is becoming vaccine resistant. A new vaccine will have to be made, but that is to be expected. Flu is always changing and it would be staggering if this flu didn't. Vaccines have to be constantly updated.' However, the UK Government has stockpiled only about ten million doses of Relenza and it is more difficult to take. While Tamiflu can be swallowed as a pill at home, Relenza is a powder that must be administered with an inhaler, normally under medical supervision. But Professor Pennington warned that stocks of Relenza had to be increased. 'We have to get as much Relenza as possible because we don't know how effective Tamiflu will be,' he said. 'With flu the best advice is to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.' Prof. Pennington, a past president of the General Society for Microbiology, said it was also 'impossible' to predict when this year's flu would strike. Dr Steve Gamblin, the joint head of molecular structure at the National Institute for Medical Research, has also previously warned that the mutation renders Tamiflu about 250 times less effective than it should be. A spokesperson for the Health Protection Agency, told the Mail Online: 'H5N1, like other influenza viruses, is constantly changing so that over a period of time new subtypes will emerge. 'New strains may not be sensitive to the vaccine currently used to protect poultry in these areas but there is currently no indication of the transmission of this new virus to humans. 'The HPA is monitoring the situation carefully with colleagues from the WHO and others. 'In England the HPA has in place a network of laboratories capable of testing for H5N1. 'Instructions and advice are available on the HPA’s website to help clinicians in dealing with travellers who are suspected of having H5N1. 'The agency also has agreed plans with Defra for dealing with the human and public health issues that may arise from a possible outbreak of avian influenza in birds in the UK (including H5N1).'",Top flu expert has warned that the main drug stockpiled by UK to fight bird flu may now be useless .

The parents of a cancer stricken teenager have told how their daughter kept her terminal illness a secret before she died. Leah Wilby, 15, wanted no one to know she was dying because she didn’t want any special treatment – preferring instead to spend her final weeks studying for her GCSEs and choosing a dress for the school prom. With the help of her mother, Debbie, father Richard, and sister Keata, 16, she kept friends, family, neighbours and teachers in the dark to fulfil her dying wish to live out her days as a ‘normal teenager’. Leah Wilby, 15, died of cancer just days after completing her GCSE examinations in 2011. She kept the cancer a secret because she wanted to be treated normally . Her doctors even arranged late night chemotherapy sessions so Leah never missed classes at Great Yarmouth High School. She exceeded medics’ expectations to sit ten exams but died just days after finishing them. Her devastated family wept with pride when they collected the results to find she had passed them all with grades ranging between A* and C. Mrs Wilby said: ‘I was always proud of Leah, but words cannot express how I felt when I saw how well she had done. ‘I already knew she was amazing but seeing the grades she achieved in those circumstances blew us away. ‘But we joked that knowing Leah she would still have been cross not to get all A*. That’s just what she was like.’ Despite her illness, Leah achieved ten GCSEs all graded between A* and C. Her parents, Debbie and Richard, say it broke their hearts to watch her revising when they knew she might not live long enough to sit the exams . Before she died, Leah bought a dress for her school prom as she hoped that she would be well enough to attend. However, did not survive and was eventually buried in the outfit . Hospital PA, Mrs Wilby, 45 added: ‘We were shocked when Leah first told us she wanted to keep her diagnosis a secret. ‘We didn’t want to lie to people but Leah was a very strong-minded girl and once she had decided that was it. ‘She loved her life as it was and she knew it would change beyond all recognition if people knew how sick she was.’ Leah had already battled and beaten neuroblastoma - a childhood cancer of the nerve cells - at the age of eight. Debbie said: ‘Leah had a lump on her neck when she was a child and I kept taking her to the doctors because I had a strong feeling something was wrong. Leah was initially diagnosed with neuroblastoma - a cancer of the nerve cells - after she developed a lump in her neck when she was eight-years-old . She had aggressive treatment for the cancer and briefly went into remission. Here she is pictured meeting McFly drummer Dougie Poynter . ‘But they assured me it was nothing to worry about. She had a history of tonsillitis and it was put down to that.’ However, during a family holiday Mrs Wilby and husband Richard, 44, noticed the lump was growing every day. When they got home a biopsy revealed it was cancer but Leah went into remission after surgery and chemotherapy. Mrs Wibly said: ‘We were so happy. Her hair grew back and Leah put the cancer behind her. ‘By the time she started high school her hair had grown back and she was with a new group of people who didn’t know what she had been through and she didn’t tell them. Leah is pictured meeting the Queen at Addenbrookes hospital, in Cambridge, where she was treated. Leah's symptoms were originally put down's to tonsillitis . ‘She loved being treated normally and she absolutely loved school. She was full of plans and dreams for the future and knew she had to study hard to achieve them.’ Leah had been predicted top grades and had already won a place at sixth form college to study four A levels when she was told the cancer had returned. Mrs Wilby said: ‘She came down one morning and told me she could feel another lump in her neck. ‘Time stood still. My heart stopped. Call it mother’s intuition, but I just knew it was back.’ Debbie contacted Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge where Leah had been treated previously and they arranged tests. Six years after she had beaten it, tests revealed the cancer was back and this time it was terminal. After Leah's death, her parents Debbie (pictured) and Richard, were given her GCSE results and went to her grave to tell her what she had achieved . Mrs Wilby said: ‘Leah was just 14. Our world collapsed but Leah remained strong. She knew straight away she didn’t want anyone to know. ‘She just wanted to carry on being Leah and living her normal life for as long as she had left.’ Leah kept her hair during chemotherapy so nobody guessed. But in March 2011, Mr and Mrs Wilby were told Leah had just weeks to live. Typically, Leah remained determined to complete her exams and the family turned their lounge into a makeshift classroom for her to study. Mrs Wilby said: ‘Every morning without fail she got washed and dressed and opened her books. It broke my heart to see her working so hard knowing she wasn’t expected to live long enough to sit the exams. ‘But at the same time I had never felt so proud or so in awe of my daughter’s courage and strength.’ Before Leah died she laid out her funeral plans, which included a wish to have her coffin pulled by white horses . Leah even shopped for a prom dress despite the event not taking place until June. Her mother said: ‘She picked a stunning pink princess design and I swore no matter how poorly she was I would get her there.’ In May 2011 she sat the first of her GCSE exams after getting special permission from the exam board to take them at home. Debbie said: ‘We had to create exam conditions and they even sent an assessor from the board. ‘Leah came down with her hair done and a look of determination on her face and got to work.’ Over the following weeks she sat a further nine exams. But by the end of May she was increasingly tired. Her parents have now started a charity called the Leah Wilby Foundation which offers the family's of children with cancer free holidays at this caravan in Great Yarmouth . ‘She was still determined to make the prom and kept trying on her dress. She looked stunning. But in our hearts we knew the end was coming. ‘By then she had told her closest girlfriends so we invited them round to say goodbye.’ On Monday June 13th, 2011 Leah died surrounded by her family. She had even left instructions for her funeral, including a carriage pulled by white horses. Neuroblastoma is a rare childhood cancer which develops from the nerve cells. It usually starts in the child's abdomen, developing in the adrenal glands, before spreading to other areas such as the bones, liver and skin. About 100 children in the UK are affected every year - it is most common in children under the age of five. The cause of the cancer is unknown but it is not generally genetic. Symptoms depend on where the cancer is and whether it has spread, but early symptoms can include aches and pains and loss of appetite. The most common symptom once the cancer has developed is a lump or swelling in the abdomen as well as constipation and stomach pain. Other possible symptoms include a lump in the neck, bone pain, numbness in the lower body, anaemia and bluish lumps in the skin. The outlook for patients is generally better if the child is younger and the cancer is slow growing. It can be treated with surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy but it often returns after treatment. She was buried in the prom dress she never got the chance to wear. As news of her death spread, friends and neighbours who still had no idea she was even ill were left shocked. Her mother said: ‘Of course it didn’t make any sense to them and they were understandably very upset but once we explained why we had kept it a secret they respected Leah’s wishes.’ Two months later a teacher from her school hand delivered Leah’s GSCE results. Leah had scored ten grades ranging between A* and C. Debbie said: ‘We went to the cemetery and told her how well she had done. We laughed and told her not to be cross that they weren’t all As.’ The family later started fundraising to be able to offer other cancer stricken youngsters the chance to enjoy normality in the way Leah had. The Leah Wilby Foundation was formed and by March last year they had raised enough to buy a caravan at the Haven Holiday Seashore camp in Great Yarmouth where families of children with cancer could spend valuable time. This year they will operate their first full season but high running costs mean they need a constant flow of donations. Debbie said: ‘These families need our help, they deserve a break in what is the most difficult time of their lives and it’s a privilege to help.’ To support the Leah Wilby Foundation providing free holidays for children with cancer visit www.theleahwilbyfoundation.co.uk .","Leah Wilby was diagnosed with neuroblastoma when she was 8-years-old .

A retired RAF officer died virtually penniless after his  family was forced to sell his home to pay for his dementia care. Wing Commander Geoff Beckett had served his country all his life. But when his health deteriorated, his bravery counted for nothing –  because he owned his house. Under rules which punish thousands of responsible pensioners every year,  he was told the £160,000 property  would have to be sold to pay for the care he needed. Penniless: Geoff Beckett in 1991 at his son's wedding, left, and the war hero in the late 1970s in Oman when he was Group Captain. He has died nearly penniless after spending six years paying for his dementia care . Over nearly six years, the widower's . carefully-accrued savings – money he would have hoped to pass to his . three grandchildren – were almost completely used up. Finally, last month, his family . managed to persuade the authorities that he was so ill he was entitled . to state help. By a terrible irony, Mr Beckett died a week later, at the . age of 88 and with virtually all his money gone. Yesterday his family backed calls for a . reformed care system which does not penalise responsible pensioners who . have saved for their retirement. 'I can't believe how my dad was . treated,' his daughter Gill Bradley, 54, said yesterday. 'He lost his . house and his savings to pay for his care and it's not right. He'd . worked hard all his life for his savings and served his country, but the . reality is there are a lot of people just like my dad who are having to . sell off their homes to pay for care. 'They said that he didn't qualify . because he had his RAF pension, savings and a house that he sold to pay . for his care. It's the system  that is at fault. 'My dad served his country but his country failed to serve him.' Dementia sufferer: The retired RAF wing commander in a wheelchair earlier this year at his daughter Gill's wedding with her husband Ian . Mr Beckett and his wife on their honeymoon in 1947. He died 10 years to the day since his late wife Joan died . The £160,000 five-bedroom house that the 88-year-old had to sell to fund his care in a residential home . 'Failed by the system': The war hero in the 1950s in Palestine, left, and when he was based in Oman, right . Mr Beckett was a member of the Home . Guard before he joined the RAF. During a colourful career he served in . Palestine in the 1950s, was involved in rocket tests in Australia and . interviewed Cold War prisoners in Berlin's Spandau Prison. At one point, . he was even wanted as a spy by the Russians. He was an aircraft engineer in Oman in . the 1970s before he retired to North Wales with his wife, Joan, where . he played golf and enjoyed building and fixing clocks. Mrs Beckett died aged 79 in 2002, and . four years later Mr Beckett started showing signs of dementia. His . family were told he would have to move to a care home – but officials at . the Betsi Cadwaladr University health board said he did not qualify for . state help. Mr Beckett in the army in the late 1940s with a monkey on his head. The government finally agreed to fund his long term care a week before he died . Daughter Gill Bradley has vowed to fight for justice so others don't suffer the same fate . As he had more than £23,000 in . savings, no support was available until the money ran out. As a result, . his family had to sell his five-bedroom house in Penmaenmawr to pay fees . of up to £2,800 a month. Over the next six years, nearly all of his . savings were swallowed up. The family repeatedly argued that his . health needs meant the bills ought to be subsidised – and finally on . September 3 the health board agreed to healthcare payments. He died just . a week later. 'He definitely warranted help from the Government,' said his daughter, a dental nurse. 'He was such an amazing person and had . such an incredible career. I'm glad he was in a good home where he was . treated with such respect, dignity and love. 'It's a shame that he didn't get the same treatment from the Government.' Last year economist Andrew Dilnot, who . was hired by the Coalition to draw up a new funding system, suggested . the amount pensioners have to pay for their care should be capped at . £35,000. However it later emerged any change in . the law could see a cap placed at £100,000 rendering the plan . 'meaningless', according to critics. Mrs Bradley added: 'My dad had an . amazing life - he went rocket testing in Australia and during the cold . war he was interviewing prisoners at Spandau Prison and worked with the . British secret service. 'He . was a bit of a James Bond - the Russians wanted him at one time and put . out his picture to say that he wasn’t allowed in their country. I’m not . sure how true that is but it’s what my dad used to tell us.'

October 2006 Mrs Bradley said she got a phone call from a local British . Gas man. The water tank had flooded my dad’s house so he’d called them . out. 'However the gas man . rang me because he was concerned that my dad had appeared confused. I . was really worried so took him to the doctors who did tests on him and . he was diagnosed with vascular dementia. 'I . used to see him on a regular basis but I must have missed little signs . because I saw him so often so it was harder to notice things, plus he . had hidden quite a lot from us for ages. I do wish I saw the signs . earlier.' After his diagnosis, Mrs Bradley was told that her father . would have to move to a care home for his own safety. Happy couple: Mr and Mrs Beckett on their wedding day in 1947 . But officials at . Betsi Cadwaladr University Local Health Board said he did not qualify . for health care payments as he had more than £23,000 of savings. She said: The government will not fund anyone with more than that and dad had a five bedroom house and an RAF pension. 'Altogether it was about £160,000 of his savings that he had to use - including selling his house - over six years. 'He . didn’t know what was really going on. I know that there was nothing . that we could do about it because someone had to take care of him. 'When he was assessed I was told that he had quite a few severe needs and qualified for help. But they then moved him to another home that they said met his needs better rather than funding him. They kept moving the goal posts. 'He was in a wheelchair and he was double incontinent and had sepsis - how poorly do you need to be to get help?' The Board finally agreed to pay for Mr Beckett’s care from September 3 but he died just a week later on September 10. Mr Beckett, pictured in Oman, paid £2,000 a month in care fees for six years . Mr Beckett, centre, enjoyed playing golf and building and fixing clocks in his retirement . Mr Beckett’s family are now battling to claim some of his money. His daughter added: '10 days before he died we finally got the confirmation that he would have his care paid for - but it was too late and he died on 10. 'I . was told to cancel his direct debit - but it was too little, too late. He definitely warranted help from the government. Some people are left . with nothing after they die because they have been made to spend all . their life savings on their own care and it’s not right.' 'He was such an amazing person and had such an incredible career in the RAF. This is why I was so upset and angry at the way he was treated. 'It’s too late for my family but I hope this helps other families to safe guard their inheritance. ‘We all want to help out children and grandchildren and pass money down the line but there is little to show for what an amazing life my dad had. 'Of course I’m glad he was in a good home where he was treated with such respect, dignity and love. It’s a shame that he didn’t get the same treatment from the government.'

Earlier this year David Cameron pledged to end the heartache of tens of thousands of elderly people who are forced to sell their homes to fund long-term care. He said he wanted to implement recommendations that cap the amount individuals pay at £35,000 - with the taxpayer picking up any further bills.","Geoff Beckett paid fees of up to £2,800 a month for care in residential home .

Now if you're going to get sick, please can you try to plan it well in advance, preferably before 5pm, Monday to Friday? In the modern NHS (which should be renamed care Not Holidays, Saturday or Sundays) getting to see our local GP at a time when it suits us rather than them has become a pipe-dream, like finding a parking space you don't have to pay for by mobile phone, or bagging a trolley at the supermarket when you haven't got a pound coin. A & E departments are in meltdown, swamped with an extra million people a year (compared with three years ago). They can't see their local doctor since new contracts in 2004 gave them a 45 per cent pay increase and allowed GPs to opt out of working unsocial hours. Janet Street-Porter, left, says: 'The Health Department reckons that 93 per . cent of doctor's surgeries in England are not open when it is . convenient for patients - but what have they done about it? Nothing' Worse, after sitting patiently in a queue in casualty for hours in the evening or weekend, there's a one in five chance the person who sees you will be a junior doctor with just a few months' experience. Many have not been long in the UK, are on short-term contracts, have limited English, and certainly no knowledge of any of your family history. Many consultants and senior doctors, like GPs, don't work at night. Millions of us have lost faith in out-of-hours helplines, run by private companies who use nurses instead of doctors, and would rather take pot luck at  hospital instead. The Health Department reckons that 93 per cent of doctor's surgeries in England are not open when it is convenient for patients - but what have they done about it? Nothing. The Care Quality Commission says emergency wards can't cope. The body which represents A & E doctors agrees.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt blames GPs. But even when you are lucky enough get to see your family doctor, in the over-stretched, reconfigured cost-efficient NHS, it's a dispiriting experience. First, they hardly look at you, and stare at their computer screen. They spend your precious few minutes of face-to-face time typing in information and reading stuff online. When you have blood tests you have to ring up a couple of days later and speak to the over-worked receptionist, who will tell you if the results are normal or not. That's a medically unqualified secretary who has a line of patients waiting for appointments and prescriptions standing right in front of her. If you require a follow-up appointment, then you will have to go through the ridiculous procedure of bagging a convenient slot all over again. Recently, my arthritis medication was altered, and the new drug requires blood tests for three months, but I was told they couldn't be put in my diary now as the surgery doesn't work that far in advance! When I asked for a printout of my last blood tests, I was told I couldn't obtain them online as so many were done every day. I have been given a password to log in and order repeat prescriptions, but I can't communicate directly with my doctor online about changing anything. This is half-baked: either you use the internet properly as a service to patients, or not. A friend was worried that the whites of her eyes looked slightly yellow, which could mean - although she felt ok - she was suffering from a serious liver complaint, or hepatitis. She waited days for her appointment, and then was disgusted when the GP (whom she'd never seen before) looked up ‘yellow eyes' on Google in front of her! Recently, Mike Farrar, head of the NHS Confederation, told a committee of MPs that he thought patients should email their doctors with their symptoms to free up surgery time. Labour MP Valerie Vaz said: ‘I thought medicine was based  on observation.' In fact, wouldn't doctors' surgeries run better if we just Googled our own symptoms and sent an email to the GP for a second opinion? (Only joking). Another sign that patients are regarded as stumbling blocks to efficiency is a controversial policy document on the Conservative Policy Forum website, an organisation chaired by Oliver Letwin and backed by party co-chairman Grant Shapps, which asks party  activists to vote on various proposals to make the NHS more 'efficient'. To my horror, they ask if it's a good or bad idea to limit the number of visits we can make to GPs in a year, and whether appointments at weekends and evenings are ‘a luxury the country cannot afford'. Another gem asks whether ‘families should take care of their infirm relatives'. This website plays an important part in determining the Conservative Party manifesto - so you have been warned. It's perfectly plain that the NHS of the future would run so much better without us, the annoying patients who clog up doctors' surgeries and A & E units. Family doctors provide a service we pay for - increasingly, it's one that suits them, rather than their customers. Oh Hell, it's Cara . Cara Delevingne says she wants to act . Bushy browed model of the moment Cara Delevingne turns up in Cannes (above) and announces, 'I want to act' - telling journalists she'd be happy to work with Tarantino, Spielberg, Scorsese or Luhrmann. The joyous arrogance of a 20-year-old! I can't say I was any different, because when you are that age you can't see why you won't be able to achieve whatever you want in life. Cara says she'd like to play 'a Dante'. I presume she means the medieval Italian poet, whose Divine Comedy - a journey from Hell to Purgatory and Paradise - has inspired artists and (more recently) a blockbuster by Dan Brown. Brown's latest opus, Inferno, has been described as 'bilge' and 'his worse book yet', but it  will still sell in  its millions. I wonder which stage of the journey interests Cara. The fashion business might be Hell, and staying that thin Purgatory - but is she ready to face God in Paradise? Having happening eyebrows doesn't necessarily mean you've got any acting ability. Carey Mulligan, one of the most talented young actresses in the world, has a uniquely mobile face that changes depending on her character. Sadly, no matter what faces she pulls on Instagram snaps, Cara always looks exactly the same. Can't we bank on the Co-Op anymore? What's going wrong at the once-reliable  Co-op? The head of finance has been forced to resign after the banking arm of the group dramatically halted plans to buy 632 branches of Lloyds last month. The Government was keen on the sale because it wants to break the dominance of the four major lenders in the High Street. To add to their woes, the Co-op's banking boss left two weeks after a major credit agency slashed the company's credit rating, causing customers to panic. Steve Humes, the group finance director who has just resigned, had no experience in  banking, but had been promoted from the  food division. Is the Co-op trying to do too much? My local branch in Masham, North Yorkshire, recently moved into a brand new building. It's bigger than their old place, but seems to sell less. The other day they ran out of potatoes. There were hardly any vegetables and little fruit. I was told ‘there hasn't been a delivery' -  everything comes from a depot. The Co-op supports Fairtrade, but do they source local suppliers? Will Mrs Polanski give him a little ticking off? Roman Polanski and Emmanuelle Seigner . Roman Polanski has not visited the  U.S. since fleeing the country in 1978 after being arrested and charged with having sex with a 13-year-old girl. The film director has mostly been based in France, avoiding countries which might  extradite him. Like many outside the rarefied world of luvvies, I find his failure to confront his past repellent, so why do his inane views about women get so much publicity? Promoting his latest film in Cannes, which stars his beautiful wife Emmanuelle Seigner (both pictured), Polanski announced that the availability of the Pill had ‘masculinised’ women, and he regretted sexual equality, saying: ‘Trying to level the genders is purely idiotic.’ Seigner is 33 years younger than Polanski, and they have two children. Wisely, she kept her mouth shut during her husband’s comments, but I hope that, back home, she might have enlightened her Neanderthal husband.","The NHS should be renamed care Not Holidays, Saturday or Sundays .

According to reports, Bieber was . rattled, but he and his eight-piece band finished the song while the . offender was taken off the stage. After a three-minute break, Bieber returned for an encore and finished the concert with Boyfriend and the finale Baby. Bieber . also performed on Saturday in Dubai as part of his international . Believe Tour and pulled a song out of respect for the country's Muslim . culture. Listening up: Justin Bieber cupped his hand behind his ear on Saturday during a concert at Sevens Stadium in Dubai, United Arab Emirates . Bieber skipped the song One Less Lonely Girl because the state religion of Islam frowns upon men touching women who are not their relatives. The singer typically recruits a young female fan to join him during the song to flirt with onstage. The respectful move followed another thoughtful incident on his international Believe Tour that occurred recently in Turkey. The Boyfriend singer paused his show multiple times on Thursday to allow fans to step away for the Muslim call to prayer. The star's tour, however, hasn't been without its rough spots. International star: Justin performed for two nights in front of fans in Dubai at Sevens Stadium . A show in Oman reportedly was cancelled because the nation deemed his act 'too sexy.' The teen pop idol also drew ire for travelling with a Capuchin monkey named Mally that was confiscated by customs officials in Munich, Germany. Justin also skulked around London in March with his shirt off and had to be restrained by a member of his entourage when he appeared to lash out at a photographer. He also drew heat in some corners in April for writing in the guest book at the Anne Frank Museum: 'Truly inspiring to be able to come here. Anne was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber.' Rocking out: Justin gave an energetic performance on Saturday for fans in Dubai . Some believed the singer's remark was tasteless and disrespectful, though museum officials defended his sincerity. Bieber was spotted letting loose in Dubai on Friday as he emerged from a . nightclub dressed in black and ended up jumping on the roof of a white . Range Rover. Justin has been touring in support of his Believe album released last June. Following his visit to Dubai and concerts in South Africa, the tour will resume in June with shows in the United States. In an odd coincidence, Motley Crue guitarist Mick Mars, 62, was knocked over on Saturday night by an overzealous fan and was hauled off by security, according to a report by TMZ. The band was performing the song Primal Scream at the Spectra Place in Canada when the man bolted across the stage, bowled Mars over and made a run at lead singer Vince Neil. The band stopped to make sure that Mars, who was celebrating his birthday on Saturday, was not hurt before resuming the show.","Motley Crue guitarist Mick Mars, 62, coincidentally was knocked over on Saturday night by an overzealous fan who was hauled off by security ."
"By . Janet Street Porter . PUBLISHED: . 19:02 EST, 12 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:35 EST, 14 May 2013 . Janet Street-Porter is proud to be a Nimby . Our ruling classes have a new term of abuse - Nimby. The Not In My Backyard brigade - anyone brave enough to stand up and shout they don't want a pylon, a smelly pig farm, a waste disposal unit, a travellers' encampment or a high-speed rail link in their neighbourhood. Nimbys are not small-minded petty bigots but normal voters and taxpayers. They wave home-made placards, march on town halls to fight ugly estates springing up around their small towns, organise sit-ins to keep cottage hospitals and maternity wards open and who don't want gorgeous views blighted by windfarms. Far from being celebrated for protecting everything we value about Britain, Nimbys are trashed by politicians as selfish irritants, objects of derision. Last week, Planning Minister Nick Boles - a man determined to concrete over as much of our green and pleasant land as possible in the name of 'progress' - finally admitted he would never be able to defeat Nimbys. This in spite of pushing through radical changes to the planning laws which could see disused barns being turned into cafes and shops, and huge new housing schemes going ahead on farmland no matter what residents say. Boles had the cheek to say Nimbys should 'channel' their anger, stop objecting and 'get involved' with developers to 'create an environment'. That's like asking us to shake hands with the devil. We need new homes, but not at the expense of our precious countryside. Developers are sitting on huge banks of land they have been stockpiling for decades, and there are enough brownfield sites to fill most of our housing needs. There is no need for councils to greenlight new projects permitted by Mr Boles's new laws until developers build on sites they already own. I'm proud to be a Nimby. I signed a petition against a huge electrical sub-station for an offshore windfarm being built on the edge of Graveney marshes in Kent - but John Prescott (who claims he  cares about the environment), Planning Minister at the time, gave it the go-ahead, and now ugly concrete bunkers desecrate this lovely spot. Janet Street-Porter has signed petitions to stop wind farms being built since she feels they ruin the landscape . On-shore windfarms are not cost-efficient and when the technology has been superseded, who is going to go around the UK digging up the ugly concrete pads these things sit on and put the soil back? Windfarms are to be built on Crown Estate farmland near Rye in East Sussex, destroying a view that inspired painters for centuries. In Scotland, the Crown Estates granted rights to Scottish and Southern Energy for an offshore windfarm which would have desecrated beautiful Kintyre - thanks to Nimbys, those plans were eventually abandoned. Another Nimby victory saw Eric Pickles rethink ludicrous plans to allow neighbours to build giant extensions (up to 26ft long) without planning permission - twice the current limit. The proposed HS2 high-speed rail link between Birmingham and London was foisted on us as if it's going to save the British economy singlehanded, when we already have a rail network that doesn't work properly and needs upgrading. Nimbys recently won an important victory with a High court ruling that plans for compensation were unfair so the Government must go through the consultation process all over again. Attacking the brave Nimbys, Ministers accused homeowners of 'putting family interests ahead of national interests'. Could this be the same bunch of politicians who complain if any new roads and factory farming units might be sited near their second homes in the country? Why shouldn't homeowners demand the full value of their home and damages if forced to leave their neighbours and decamp somewhere fresh so a train can whizz through the beautiful Chilterns and Warwickshire, delivering businessmen to Manchester a little bit quicker? By the time the railway is built, business will be conducted via the internet and this 'need' for intercity commuting will have evaporated! Last week, a Commons Committee decided that instead of building a new airport in the Thames, Heathrow should be allowed two more runways further to the West. These MPs assumed that we need more airport capacity in the London area, when there is plenty of evidence we have enough airports all over the country to take  more flights. Expect Nimbys living west of London to start marshalling their opposition - and that will include all the MPs whose constituencies these extra 'essential' flights will be polluting with fumes and noise from early morning to late at night. Some planning reforms are long-overdue - allowing offices, hotels and leisure facilities to be turned into housing and schools, for example. Anything which breathes life back into our High Streets is to be welcomed. But asking Nimbys to stop protesting and cosy up to developers - whose agenda is pure profit - is nothing more than wishful thinking. I will go to my grave a Nimby - and I'm not going to be told I'm unpatriotic or small-minded. STILL TRYING TO BE A REBEL REBEL... Ageing pop star needs publicity to promote his new album. How to shock? Pose as a Christ-like figure singing in a basement bar frequented by priests, a boozy cardinal and some gorgeous semi-clad hookers. David Bowie's embarrassing video for his new  single The Next Day was removed from YouTube for 'violating the terms of  service' - in other words for causing offence. 'David Bowie's embarrassing video for his new single The Next Day was removed from YouTube for ""violating the terms of service"" - in other words for causing offence' Later - when the ban made news - it was reinstated with a warning about  'adult content'. We're told Bowie 'wrote and conceived' the video - but he's no Baz Luhrmann. In this parade of hackneyed imagery, the gorgeous  Marion Cotillard writhes around in a corset spouting blood from stigmata in her hands, while Gary Oldman does a feeble impersonation of a priest. It is about as  subversive as a cup of cocoa. The Christian church has huge problems, from allegations that abuse has been routinely ignored to the Church of England's refusal to accept women as bishops, but would Bowie have had the guts to attack Islam in the same way? BLOW THE WHISTLE ON FERGIE FEVER . Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson arrives on the pitch at Old Trafford for the last time before retiring . You'd think Britain was mourning the loss of a  monarch - the retirement of a football manager has been elevated to an event of national importance. Sir Alex Ferguson has been touted as one of the great-est businessmen this cen-tury - but, please let's get his achievements in perspective. Fergie didn't discover a cure for cancer, or find a crop that would feed starving farmers in Africa. As for his wife Cathy - do we need to worry how she will 'adjust' to life with her irascible husband hanging around  the house? Football might give pleasure to millions, but during Fergie's reign, the players were vastly over-rewarded, while the poor, loyal fans paid through the nose. A VOTE FOR GREY POWER . Thanks to the hundreds of you that wrote and emailed after I told Iain Duncan Smith off for his patronising suggestion that 'wealthy' pensioners should hand back their winter fuel allowances. IDS has done an excellent job of alienating voters - many of you suggested we form the Grey Party and I stand for Parliament. Removing our entitlements like bus passes seems to be a sure-fire way of committing political suicide - especially as MPs enjoy subsidised food and drink in their many  in-house hostelries. As you point out, free bus passes keep rural services running during the day and we use them to visit town centres, shop (even if it's in Poundland!) and meet mates for coffee or 'two for one' lunches. I'm not sure I want to stand for Parliament - being a dictator is more  my style.","Columnist says Nimbys should be praised, not criticised .

"By . Suzannah Hills . PUBLISHED: . 04:26 EST, 25 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:28 EST, 25 March 2013 . The SS United States is sending out what may be its final distress call unless $500,00 can be found in the next two months to save the transatlantic cruise ship from the scrap heap. A preservation group is leading a campaign to secure a permanent home for the 990-foot-long vessel but is in desperate need of funds to keep it afloat. Talks are under way with developers and investors about the ship's long-term future, but without the emergency funding, its caretakers fear they will run out of money before a deal is inked. Campaign: Money and time are running out for the historic ocean liner SS United States, moored in Philadelphia, which needs $500,000 of funding to stay afloat . Rusting away: An enclosed walkway on the once-glamorous cruise ship is now just a barren shell . The historic ocean liner carried princes and presidents across the Atlantic in the 1950s and 1960s but has spent decades patiently awaiting a savior at its berth on the Philadelphia waterfront. 'We've made progress on the fundraising side and the redevelopment side,' said Susan Gibbs, executive director of the SS United States Conservancy and granddaughter of the ship's Philadelphia-born designer, William Francis Gibbs. 'Our immediate goal is to buy some time.' The group has raised $1 million through fundraisers and a website, where contributors can sponsor a piece of the ship for $1 per square foot. But the campaigners say they desperately need donors with deep pockets and high profiles to help save the ship. 'Are we giving up on successfully redeveloping the ship as a self-sustaining entity? Absolutely not,' said Dan McSweeney, head of the redevelopment efforts. At risk: The 990-foot-long ship could be sold for scrap in two months time unless $500,000 is raised to save it . High costs: It costs $80,000 every month for mooring, maintenance, insurance and security . Ravaged: Moored in Philadelphia, the SS United States is now owned by the nonprofit SS United States Conservancy . 'We continue to have active discussions with potential partners, we have ideas of potential sites for the ship, but we need more time to get it off the ground ... and we're running out of runway.' It costs $80,000 a month just for mooring, basic maintenance, insurance and security, he said. The conservancy is exploring potential partnerships with four entities in Philadelphia and New York City to refashion the vessel as a stationary entertainment complex with 500,000 square feet of space for a hotel, theater, restaurants and shopping. The sluggish economy and other factors have slowed negotiations, McSweeney said. As talks continue, he said, the hope is to convince corporate sponsors, influential politicians and prominent business leaders - are you listening, Donald Trump and Michael Bloomberg? - to lend their political and financial capital to the effort. 'Any way you look at it, there is no downside to this project,' McSweeney said. 'It's an economic and community development project that's going to create jobs.' A lot of work to do: The rusted and ruined interior view of the SS United States . Heyday: The SS United States pictured in front of the Midtown Manhattan skyline and Empire State building as it begins its first voyage along the Hudson River to Europe from New York in 1952 . The SS United States carried more than one million passengers at record-breaking transatlantic speeds over the course of 400 round trips from 1952 to 1969, among them President John F. Kennedy, Prince Rainier of Monaco, Salvador Dali and Elizabeth Taylor. A joint venture between the Navy and ship designer Gibbs & Cox, the luxury liner was made with hidden military might - it could have been converted in a single day to transport 14,000 troops for 10,000 miles before refueling. After being decommissioned it changed hands multiple times, from the Navy and on through a series of restoration-minded investors. It was towed from Virginia to Turkey to Ukraine, finally arriving in Philadelphia as a gutted hulk in 1996. Another succession of developers and a cruise lines failed to return the ship to service as retrofitting costs proved too great. A local philanthropist's 11th-hour gift of $5.8 million allowed the SS United States Conservancy to save the ship from the scrapper and keep it berthed and maintained for 20 months. That was last November. 'It's an all hands on deck moment,' Gibbs said. 'Now is the time, there's a window. Within months it will close unless everyone assists in the effort.' Record holder: The once-great liner is still the holder of the Blue Riband for the fastest trans-Atlantic crossing which it set in July of 1952 . Special honour: The ship is still the only man-made object within America to bear the name United States .","Vessel carried more than one million passengers  over 400 round .

"Shooter identified as 26-year-old Tyler Brehm . Shooter killed by off-duty police officer working on film set . Driver 'critical' after being shot in the jaw; two others injured . Witness: 'I was like ""Dude, they're shooting at us!""' By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . UPDATED: . 05:19 EST, 11 December 2011 . This is the moment police cornered a gunman who went on a shooting spree on Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard. Passers-by initially thought thought Tyler Brehm, 26, was an actor from a movie being filmed nearby – until he was shot dead by a policeman. Brehm wounded three people before he was killed by an off-duty officer who had been working as a security guard on the neighbouring film, believed to be a gangster thriller starring Sean Penn. A 40-year-old car driver remained in a critical condition in hospital last night after being shot in the jaw in the bizarre incident on Friday morning in Sunset Boulevard. Two other men suffered minor injuries. Scroll down for video . Down: Police shot and killed the gunman, identified as Tyler Brehm, 26. The reason why he started shooting on Sunset Boulevard is still unknown . Drama: The gunman stands in the middle of the road as he prepares to shoot the driver of the passing pickup on a Hollywood street . The shooting began around 10.30am Friday, but police were still trying to determine why Brehm began firing randomly. Little is known about Brehm except that he lived in Hollywood. Identified: Tyler Brehm, 26, was the man who started shooting at passers-by in Hollywood . The . reason for his shoot out is unknown, but some reports speculate that . since his Facebook page says he ended a relationship four days ago, that . may have had something to do with his actions. Witness Micah Williams said he and a friend thought the suspect was part of a movie. ‘Then the third bullet ricocheted right by our head and I was like, “Dude, they’re shooting at us,” ’ he said. Another bystander, Gregory Bojorquez, . said: ‘At first it seemed like a movie but then I heard the sound of . the bullets hitting metal. It was bizarre, like something from a cop . show. You get so used to seeing filming in LA that lots of people were . watching it thinking it was for a film.’ It is thought the gunman ran out of bullets and had pulled a knife from his belt when he was shot by the policeman. Brehm, . who was Hispanic and dressed in a white sweat vest, was filmed from an . office block standing in the middle of the road firing on pedestrians . and motorists. Questionable interests: Shown here in his Twitter profile picture, Tyler Brehm clearly displays a bong in the background . Speaking his mind: Brehm Tweeted at actor Charlie Sheen just days before the shooting . At first, witnesses didn’t know if the shooting was part of movie as the gunman fired shots into the air before aiming at pedestrians and forcing cars to veer away. The time and place of the shooting meant that there were many witnesses, some of whom watched from nearby high-rise apartments. 'He was just kind of shooting spontaneously,' witness William Wiles told The Baltimore Sun Times, recalling what he saw as he watched incident from his bedroom window. 'He didn't really have any mission or purpose or anyone in particular,' Mr Wiles continued. Another spectator shot video of the event while watching from his apartment. 'I was on the phone and I heard some popping sounds,"" Chris Johns said. Mr . Johns even tried to stop the shooting from his high vantage point by . attempting to distract the shooter by shouting at him from his . fourth-floor apartment. 'Hey why don't you come up here! Come up here buddy!' Mr Johns yelled. Happier times: Brehm's mother Melissa had pictures of Tyler and his ex-girlfriend Alicia Alligood, who he broke up with just four days before the shooting . Family ties: Melissa and Tyler Brehm seemed happy in this photo together . 'This was like a serious mad man. He snapped and he's going to try to kill as many people as possible,' Mr Johns said. Mr Johns told KABC-TV he saw a plain-clothes officer shoot the man. 'I started shouting out to the officer, saying ""take him out, that's the guy!""' he said. An off-duty police motorcycle officer working as security on a film set also rushed to the scene to join the confrontation. He shot the suspect after he ran out of bullets and produced a knife, according to witnesses. Dave Pepper told KCAL-TV that he was in his car when the gunman came at him. 'This . guy came running across the street and he put the gun right up to this . window,' Mr Pepper said as he sat in the car. ""Why he didn't pull the . trigger I don't know.' The . 40-year-old male driver of a Mercedes-Benz was wounded in his upper . body and taken to a hospital in unknown condition. A truck and another . car were struck by bullets. Shot dead: The body of the gunman is covered with a blanket after the confrontation where he screamed at officers. 'I want to die' Blasted: The gunman fires into the vehicle before walking off and then producing a knife after running out of bullets . Death scene: The famed Hollywood intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Vine St where the shooting took place . Oscar . Herrera, a witness, said he saw the gunman walking down the middle of . Vine Street near Sunset Boulevard, firing at least nine shots into the . air and at passing cars. 'People were running all over. People was ducking,' Mr Herrera said. Sean Penn and Ryan Gosling's crime drama, Gangster Squad, is being filmed nearby. It is unknown if the actors were on set during the real-life shooting, but they would have heard the gunfire. In the Los Angeles area, every movie production is required to have a permit, so if there is shooting,  for a movie, locals are notified for any loud noises and big signs are placed on street corners. The area was cordoned off and the gunman lay under a white sheet in the street hours after the gunfire, leaving traffic tangled on busy Hollywood streets, an area is packed with stores and restaurants.

A schoolboy who suffered the worst brain injury 'medics had ever seen' has stunned doctors after waking from a two week coma. Harry Davies, 11, was cycling home from school when he was knocked down by a car and thrown head first on to the road. The pupil suffered a large six-inch fracture in his skull, despite wearing a bike helmet, which neurologists described as the worst head injury they'd ever seen. Harry, from Pencaitland, East Lothian, in Scotland, was rushed to hospital where he was placed in a medically-induced coma on June 3 while doctors inserted a bolt in his skull to reduce the swelling of his brain. Remarkable: Harry Davies, 11, pictured recovering in the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh after waking up from a two-week-long coma . But two weeks later, Harry amazed doctors when he woke up on Sunday and he is now sitting up, eating and drinking, and talking to friends and family. His mother Lisa, 46, said: 'He was knocked off his bike and hit his . head. He had a six-inch crack in his skull and he had a fractured . cheekbone. But it was the opposite side of the brain that was damaged . because of the ricochet effect. 'The neurologist said he had not seen this level of trauma in the brain of a child before. He's been quite lucky and he's a fighter.' The bolt, which Harry's parents say the schoolboy jokingly refers to as his 'Dalek bolt', will remain his head until his skull has almost fully healed. Injury: Harry Davies, 11, was placed in a medically-induced coma after he was knocked over by a car and thrown head first on to the road causing a six-inch fracture in his skull . Mrs Davies, who works for a mobile phone . company said: 'After about a week we were told that they expected Harry to recover. 'He . was woken up from the coma after one week but he wasn't able to handle . it, so doctors put him back to sleep for another week to let his brain . recover. After that he woke up and was able to cope with it. 'He is really making progress. He's talking to people and . he recognises his family and friends. 'He's sitting up and is able to . eat and drink. He is looking really well.' His father Nick, 46, said added that he couldn't have wished for a better Father's Day present when his son woke up on Sunday. Since waking, the schoolboy has made . such a quick recovery he was even able to bypass the high-dependency . unit at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh and go . straight to a neurology ward. Casualty: Harry, pictured left, was cycling home with his friend Douglas, pictured right, when he was knocked down by a car. He was then rushed to hospital where neurologists said his skull fracture was the worst head injury they'd ever seen . His mother continued: 'He should have gone from intensive care to high dependency, but he's on the neurology ward.' Harry had been cycling home with his . best friend, 12-year-old Douglas Simpson, when he was struck by the car. Douglas, who was on foot, was also hit but landed in a soft verge and . escaped unharmed. Harry was fortunate not to be killed outright - with doctors claiming his helmet is the only reason he survived. Mrs Davies added: 'Medical staff told us that if Harry . hadn't been wearing a helmet he would have died. He's always been very . safety conscious and he wouldn't have got on a bike without a helmet.' Police Scotland said they were continuing to appeal for witnesses over the incident.","Harry Davies was cycling home from school when he was hit by a car .

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 06:07 EST, 21 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:43 EST, 21 June 2013 . A couple who spent thousands of pounds on IVF have finally had a baby after conceiving naturally. Ian Scott-Garrett, 37, and his wife Vicky, 35, tried for a baby for seven years and spent £20,000 on IVF. All of the IVF attempts failed but Mrs Scott-Garrett finally conceived naturally after a short spell on the contraceptive pill. Vicky and Ian Scott-Garrett conceived Ollie naturally after spending £20,000 on failed IVF. They believe that the contraceptive pill 'reset' Mrs Scott-Garrett's hormones allowing her to conceive . Baby Ollie was born in December but had to spend the first five months of his life in Birmingham . Children’s Hospital because he was born with his oesophagus unconnected to his stomach. Mr Scott-Garrett, a tutor at Birmingham Metropolitan College, said: ‘When we found out Vicky was pregnant we were thrilled. But when we found out that the baby had a significant health problem it was a real blow. ‘But the hospital staff were incredible and prepared us for what might happen.’ Mr Scott-Garrett had been told years earlier that he would never have children because of treatment he had for a brain tumour. So, after seven years of trying to get pregnant the couple from West Bromwich, in the West Midlands, finally decided to put baby plans on the back burner to plan their wedding, and have one last shot at IVF afterwards. Mr Scott-Garrett (pictured with Ollie) was told that he would never be able to have children because of treatment he received for a brain tumour . Mrs Scott-Garrett, already mother to Phillipa 12, and Christopher, 14, from a previous relationship, went on the pill to settle her hormones for six months. But just weeks after coming off it she conceived before she had a chance to try IVF again. She said: ‘My body seems to think it’s older than it is. My hormones are like a menopausal woman and it was making it difficult to get pregnant. ‘The doctors seemed to think that the pill has reset my body somehow and stabilised my hormones which were preventing me from conceiving. Ollie (pictured with his mother a few minutes after his birth) was born with oesophageal atresia - a condition which meant that his stomach was not connected to his oesophagus - he had to have surgery at two-days-old . ‘If I had known I would have saved the money and gone on the pill years ago.’ She added: ‘Going through IVF put a huge strain on our relationship, and we even turned to counselling. ‘The guilt of not being able to give Ian a child almost tore us apart.’ Three months before their wedding, the couple learnt that Mr Scott-Garrett’s father had terminal leukaemia and had just weeks to live. Ollie was conceived just as they were coming to terms with the news. Immediately after his birth in December, Ollie was rushed to Birmingham Children's Hospital where he spent the first five months of his life. He was allowed to go home in May . Ollie did not feed properly in the womb meaning his mother's stomach became so swollen with fluid that ligaments ripped off her ribcage . ‘My Dad was desperate for us to have a child. It was like it was his dying wish to give us a new life as he lost his,’ said Mr Scott-Garrett. However, the couple’s struggle was far from over. At Mrs Scott-Garrett’s 20 week scan doctors were unable to identify Ollie’s stomach. ‘It felt like our brief happiness had been taken away from us. We had been trying for so long, and it felt cruel. “Why us?” is what we were thinking,’ said her husband. Doctors told the parents-to-be that their baby was most probably going to be born with oesophageal atresia, where the oesophagus is not connected to the stomach, which would cause him long-term problems. Mrs Scott-Garrett says that going through IVF put a huge strain on the couple's relationship and that if she had known the contraceptive pill could help she would have tried taking it years earlier . They were prepared by medics for the . fact that their baby might be born not breathing, and he would have to . have an operation to determine the full extent of the problem. As Ollie was not feeding in properly in the womb, his mother’s stomach became so swollen with fluid that ligaments ripped off her ribcage. She said: ‘In the weeks before Ollie was born I was so uncomfortable I could barely walk. ‘I was huge. I couldn’t sleep and could only cat-nap sitting up. At the same time as Ollie was conceived, Mr and Mrs Scott-Garrett learnt that Mr Scott-Garrett's father, Neil (right) had terminal cancer. They believe that Ollie was his parting gift to them . The couple are now trying to raise money for the Neonatal Surgical Ward at Birmingham Children's Hospital where Ollie was cared for . ‘When I went into the maternity ward I met a lady about to have twins and I was bigger than her.’ Ollie was born at 37 weeks after just a two hour labour. Oesophageal atresia is a congenital abnormality in which the oesophagus is not connected to the stomach. The exact cause is not known. The condition occurs in about one in every 3,000 babies. In more than 50 per cent of babies with oesophageal atresia there are also other abnormalities. The condition can often be diagnosed before the baby is born as it can mean the baby's stomach cannot be seen on the ultrasound scans. Once the baby is born it may experience respiratory distress, choking, feeding difficulties and frothing from the mouth. Surgery usually has to be carried out shortly after birth to enable the baby to feed normally. Babies with the condition now have a 90 per cent survival rate. Mrs Scott-Garrett said: ‘He was . breathing when he arrived, so me and Ian were able to give him a cuddle . before he was taken to Birmingham Children’s Hospital. ‘Seeing Ian cuddle him for the first time was magical. But we couldn’t enjoy being a normal family yet.’ Ollie spent five months in Birmingham Children’s Hospital but was finally allowed to go home at the end of May. The couple are now trying to raise money for the Neonatal Surgical Ward at Birmingham Children’s Hospital where Ollie was cared for. ‘The staff in the ward were angels,’ Mr Scott-Garrett said. ‘There is no other word for them. The love, kindness and care they have shown to Ollie and all of us as a family is incredible. ‘Ollie had his first operation when he was just two-days-old and we were in bits - they held us together.’ He added: ‘When we went to see him on Christmas Day the nurses had put a card next to his cot from him to us. It was so moving and meant so much to us.’ To make a donation to the couple’s fundraising efforts go to www.justgiving.com/glyn-price1 .","Ian and Vicky Scott-Garrett spent £20,000 on IVF treatment which failed .

An investigation has been launched after a seven-year-old girl found at the bottom of a swimming pool died while a bungling 911 dispatcher lost precious minutes because he could not find the correct number for an ambulance. Kaitlynn Breann Garcia was pulled from Eucha State Park pool in Missouri while on a family day out on June 15 and was given CPR as a bystander frantically dialed emergency services. However, the 911 dispatcher did not know where the pool was located and then wasted four minutes as he dialed a wrong number for emergency response. Scroll down for video . Tragic blunders: Kaitlynn Garcia, 7, of Seneca, Missouri, drowned at a public pool. A 911 dispatcher lost valuable minutes in getting an ambulance to her as he had the wrong police phone number . The dispatcher asks directions to the swimming pool from the female caller, saying: 'Lake Eucha Pool? You know where that is?' According to a recording of the tape on news9.com, the dispatcher then calls the wrong number. He can be heard saying: 'Yes. Is this Jay? Yeah, I'm sorry. I've got the wrong number.' The woman who made the 911 call becomes increasingly frantic, saying: 'Hurry. We don’t know if she is breathing or not...' The dispatcher continues: 'I, I, I'm trying to get a hold of an ambulance as best--trying to do the best, trying to do the best I can.' It takes almost four minutes before the call is connected to the Jay Police Department - who are actually the ones who call an ambulance. In total, it takes almost another 15 minutes for an ambulance to reach the scene from when the call is made. Kaitlynn, from Seneca, was found in nine feet of water and died following the tragic incident.

Probe: Gillian Astbury, 66, died at Stafford Hospital after staff failed to give her insulin in what amounted to 'a gross failure to provide basic care' A criminal investigation has begun into the death of a woman at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital, the Health and Safety Executive said today. Gillian Astbury died after slipping into a diabetic coma at the hospital in 2007. An inquest into her death found that the failure to administer insulin to the 66-year-old amounted to a gross failure to provide basic care. An HSE spokesman said: 'Following legal advice, HSE deferred a decision to pursue the investigation into Gillian Astbury's death until the conclusion of the public inquiry, chaired by Robert Francis QC, into Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. 'We can now confirm that our inspectors have today formally started an investigation. 'Our focus will be on establishing whether there is evidence of the employer (the Trust) or individuals failing to comply with their responsibilities under the Health and Safety at Work Act.' The report by Mr Francis highlighted 'appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of people' at the Trust between 2005 and 2009. As many as 1,200 patients may have died needlessly after they were 'routinely neglected' at the hospital. Many were left lying in their own urine and excrement for days, forced to drink water from vases or given the wrong medication. Mrs Astbury, from Hednesford, Staffordshire, died in the early hours of April 11, 2007 while being treated for fractures to her arm and pelvis. Jurors at the September 2010 inquest found that a contributory factor in her death was a systemic failure to provide adequate nursing facilities and low staffing levels. Criminal investigation: The Health and Safety Executive today said they were investigating Gillian Astbury's death at Stafford Hospital to see whether the Trust or any individuals may have broken the law . Returning a narrative verdict after the two-day hearing, the 10-member panel also said another contributory factor was the failure of nursing staff to record glucose levels, communicate properly with each other and read clinical notes. In its verdict, the jury said: 'We are satisfied that there were serious shortcomings in systems and in implementation, monitoring and management of the systems in place. 'Nursing facilities were poor, staff levels were too low, training was poor, and record-keeping and communications systems were poor and inadequately managed.' The inquest heard that Mrs Astbury's blood sugar levels were not properly monitored and insulin was not administered on the day before her death, despite being prescribed by doctors. Some of the nursing staff were also not informed that Mrs Astbury was diabetic and some said they were too busy to check the patient notes at the foot of her bed. A police investigation was launched after her death, but the Crown Prosecution Service ruled that there was insufficient evidence to bring charges.

Seeing 10 adverts for tobacco can increase teenagers' risk of taking up smoking by almost 40 per cent, a new study has today claimed. The German led research also found that the same number of sightings increase the chances of teenagers indulging in the habit daily by 30 per cent. They based their findings on more than 1,300 ten to 15-year-old non-smokers. The group was exposed to tobacco advertising and their subsequent behaviour was monitored over a period of two-and-a-half years. Billboard tobacco advertising is not yet banned in Germany. In 2008, the children - all pupils at 21 public schools in three different regions of Germany -  were asked how often they had seen particular adverts. These included images for six of the most popular cigarette brands in Germany and eight other products, such as chocolate, clothes, mobile phones, and cars. In 2011, 30 months later, they were asked the same question, as well as how many cigarettes they had smoked to date, and whether they smoked regularly. One in three admitted having tried smoking during the 30 month study period, with one in 10 saying that they had smoked within the preceding month. One in 20 said they had smoked more than 100 cigarettes, and were therefore classified as 'established' smokers, while a similar proportion said they now smoked every day. A third of the daily smokers were aged 14 or younger; one in four was 16 or older. Exposure to cigarettes ads was much lower than that for the other non-tobacco products, but an ad for one particular cigarette brand was seen by almost half the youngsters at least once, and more than 10 times by 13 per cent of the sample. When a range of well known influences for taking up smoking was factored in, smoking among peers proved the strongest influence, followed closely by exposure to tobacco adverts. The German led research also found that the same number of sightings increase the chances of teenagers indulging in the habit daily by 30 per cent . General advertising, promotions, and sponsorship of sporting events . from tobacco and cigarette companies were banned in the UK in  2003, . although some small exceptions to this legislation remain. At . the time of the ban, 23 per cent of UK 15-year-olds smoked. According . to the latest figures, that has dropped to just 11 per cent, but the . figures remain higher in poorer areas. The . Government is also moving towards legislation which would insist that . all cigarette packets are completely blank and have no markings or . logos. It comes after a ban on tobacco displays in large shops started last year with smaller shops to follow suit by 2015. The German analysis showed the greater the exposure to tobacco promotion, the greater the likelihood that the teen would take up smoking. The government imposed a ban on cigarette advertising on UK television almost 50 years ago, amid calls from the Royal College of . Physicians, who flagged up health problems associated with smoking and . pushed for stronger laws on advertising tobacco. The first link between smoking and lung cancer had been discovered in the late 1950s. While television advertising for cigarettes was banned in 1965,  promotions for tobacco and . cigars remained on screens until 1991. In 2003, then Health Secretary Alan Milburn joined Public Health Minister Hazel Blears in Lambeth, south . London, to announce the ban on all promotion of tobacco. Speaking at the scene, Mr Milburn said he hoped up to 3,000 lives could be saved each year because of the ban. He added: 'Tobacco advertising and sponsorship have acted as a . recruiting sergeant for children and young teenagers to start the . tobacco habit.' Teenagers who saw the most tobacco ads (11 to 55) were around twice as likely to become established smokers and daily smokers as those who saw the least (zero to 2.5). And for each additional 10 sightings of a tobacco ad, a teen was 38 per cent more likely to become an established smoker and 30 per cent more likely to smoke every day, compared with sightings for non-tobacco product adverts. After taking account of other influential factors, the overall risk of becoming an established smoker was between three per cent and 7.3 per cent greater, while that of taking up daily smoking was between three per cent and 6.4 per cent greater, depending on how many adverts the teenager had seen. The authors acknowledge that a large proportion of the original 2,300 students involved, dropped out and that as with any observational study, there is always the chance that some as yet unmeasured factor could explain the results. However, they concluded that the data from their study support the association between tobacco advertising and smoking behaviour.","German followed 1,300 ten to 15-year-old non-smokers over 2.5 years .

A jury heard excerpts from James 'Whitey' Bulger's FBI informant file dating from the 1970s to 1990 in court today that show the former gangster provided information about a variety of people. The files, read to the jury as part of Bulger's racketeering trial, show Bulger secretly informed on a range of criminals, including rival gangs, members of the Italian Mafia and people in his own South Boston neighborhood. Bulger, 83, is standing trial on racketeering charges, including playing a role in 19 killings during the 1970s and '80s while allegedly leading the Winter Hill Gang. His lawyers have strongly denied that he was an FBI informant. Instead, they say, he paid certain FBI agents for information that would help him and his gang, including tip-offs on investigations and indictments. Brought low: James 'Whitey' Bulger as he is today, and left, in an undated file photo released by the FBI soon after his 1995 disappearance . At one point Monday, Bulger appeared to be visibly angry during arguments between his lawyer and the prosecution outside earshot of the jury. Several people heard him mutter an expletive and deny that he was an informant. The jury spent the day listening to James Marra, a special agent with the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General, read excerpts from Bulger's 700-page FBI file. Marra said file documents show that . Bulger began working as an informant in 1971, but was shut down after a . short time after his FBI handler determined he was not providing useful . information. Marra said Bulger became an informant again in 1975 for . then-FBI Agent John Connolly and continued in that role almost . continually for about 15 years, until Connolly retired. FBI files: FBI agent James Marra, left, seen here at the murder trial of former FBI agent John Connelly in Miami in 2008, today read the FBI informant files of James 'Whitey' Bulger to a jury . Connolly was later convicted of racketeering for warning Bulger and his gang of an upcoming indictment, prompting Bulger to flee. Bulger was one of the nation's most wanted fugitives for more than 16 years when he was finally captured in Santa Monica, California in 2011. Marra read reports written by Connolly . and several supervisors at the FBI in which they described meetings they . had with Bulger and information he gave them about criminal activity . ranging from drug trafficking to murder. Crooked: Former FBI agent John Connolly was sentenced to 40 years in prison in 2009 for slipping information to Boston mobsters that led to the 1982 shooting death of a Miami gambling executive . Marra . was asked to read several reports Connolly wrote about what Bulger . allegedly told him about the killing of Edward 'Brian' Halloran in 1982. Prosecutors . say Bulger and an associate gunned down Halloran after Connolly told . him Halloran was talking to the FBI about Bulger's role in the 1981 . killing of an Oklahoma businessman. But in his conversations with . Connolly, Bulger said he had heard on the street that the Mafia had . killed Halloran. He later gave Connolly the names of some criminals from . Boston's Charlestown neighborhood he suggested may have killed . Halloran. Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Wyshak asked Marra if, after reviewing the FBI file on . Bulger, there was any doubt in his mind that Bulger was an FBI . informant. Marra was not allowed to answer the question after Bulger's . attorney, Hank Brennan, objected. Brennan argued that Marra has no . firsthand knowledge of whether Bulger was an informant. And the defense . claims that Connolly fabricated all the reports in the FBI file to cover . up his own corruption. But Wyshak argued that the file shows that Bulger provided information not just to Connolly, but to other FBI agents, including John Morris and James Ring, Connolly's supervisors. 'I understand that for whatever reasons - whether it's the ego of the defendant or attempting to preserve his reputation - he does not want to be called an informant, but I am not going to tailor my questions in a manner that preserves that ridiculous contention,' Wyshak said. Judge Denise Casper sided with the defense. Marra said Bulger told FBI agents about a litany of criminal activity involving a long list of people, including a group dealing heroin in a South Boston housing project and a man who was setting up an armored car robbery. Morris is expected to be the next witness after Marra is cross-examined by Bulger's attorneys Tuesday.","Excerpts from FBI informant files were read to the jury today that indicate Boston gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger was an FBI informant for many years .

British eavesdropping agency GCHQ has secretly accessed fibre-optic cables carrying huge amounts of internet and communications data, according to documents disclosed by whistleblower Edward Snowden. The agency is able to tap into and store data - including phone calls and e-mails between innocent people - from the cables for up to 30 days so it can be analysed under an operation codenamed Tempora, the Guardian reported. The Cheltenham-based agency would not comment on intelligence matters but insisted it was 'scrupulous' in complying with the law. Whistleblower: GCHQ has secretly been tapping into and storing internet and communications data via fibre optic cables, according to Edward Snowden . The information is the latest leak from Mr Snowden, the NSA whistleblower responsible for a string of disclosures about U.S. intelligence operations. The newspaper claimed Operation Tempora had been running for 18 months and GCHQ and the NSA are consequently able to access vast quantities of communications between entirely innocent people as well as targeted suspects. It means the agency has the ability to sift through everything from an individual's phone calls to their internet search history and even the content of their e-mails and Facebook entries. The newspaper said there were two . principal components to the agency's surveillance programme, called . Mastering the Internet and Global Telecoms Exploitation. It claimed the data was shared with the organisation's U.S. counterpart the National Security Agency (NSA). Mr Snowden, who fled the US for Hong Kong after deciding to reveal the NSA's secrets, told the Guardian he wanted to expose 'the largest programme of suspicionless surveillance in human history'. 'It's not just a U.S. problem. The UK has a huge dog in this fight,' he said. 'They (GCHQ) are worse than the U.S.' The Guardian reported that GCHQ lawyers told U.S. counterparts there was a 'light oversight regime' in Britain compared with America. Yet the leaked documents reveal Britain has developed the technical capacity to access the cables that carry the world's communications and process the vast ocean of data. The newspapers said the documents revealed that by last year GCHQ was handling 600 million 'telephone events' each day, had tapped more than 200 fibre-optic cables and was able to process data from at least 46 of them at a time. Each cable carries data at a rate of 10 gigabits per second - giving some idea of the sheer quantity of information being processed by the British spy agency - and the operation is expanding further still as more and more cables are tapped, according to the report. Surveillance: National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden said that when it came to 'suspicionless surveillance' Cheltenham-based GCHQ was 'worse than the U.S.' Partner: It is claimed GCHQ is sharing sensitive information gleaned via Operation Tempora with its U.S. counterpart the National Security Agency . Privacy campaign group Big Brother . Watch's director Nick Pickes said: 'This appears to be dangerously close . to, if not exactly, the centralised database of all our internet . communications, including some content, that successive governments have . ruled out and Parliament has never legislated for. 'Britain . has a clear legal process in place to govern the interception of the . content of communications and blanket interception is not a part of that . system. 'If GCHQ have . been intercepting huge numbers of innocent people's communications as . part of a massive sweeping exercise, then I struggle to see how that . squares with a process that requires a warrant for each individual . intercept. This question must be urgently addressed in Parliament. 'The . fact GCHQ staff have been discussing how light the UK's oversight . regime is compared to the US highlights why we need a wholesale review . of surveillance law, including the fact that there is absolutely no . judicial process within the current system and the people making these . decisions are able to hide in the shadows rather than face public . scrutiny.' A GCHQ spokeswoman said: 'We do not . comment on intelligence matters. Our intelligence agencies continue to . adhere to a rigorous legal compliance regime. 'GCHQ are scrupulous in their legal compliance.' Former NSA contracter Edward Snowden is facing up to 30 years in prison after he was charged with espionage and theft of government property by the Justice Department last night. Snowden, believed to be holed up in Hong Kong, has admitted providing information to the news media about two highly classified NSA surveillance programs. A one-page criminal complaint unsealed yesterday in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, says Snowden engaged in unauthorized communication of national defence information and willful communication of classified communications intelligence information. The intelligence gathered via Operation Tempora is understood to have contributed to a number of arrests and convictions including a terror cell in the Midlands who were jailed for planning co-ordinated attacks. It is also claimed to have led to the arrest of five Luton-based individuals preparing acts of terror, and three London-based people planning attacks prior to the Olympics. A source with knowledge of the work of the intelligence agencies said: 'It's not about going through everybody's emails or phone calls. It's about homing in on criminal activity in order to lead the intelligence agencies to be able to take action.' The source said the vast majority of the data gathered was discarded, with the agency focused on the 'needles' of relevant information within the 'haystack' of material. The source said: 'What they do is scan the haystack of bulk data for any needles that could have national security implications. 'All the rest gets discarded and is not looked at. The vast bulk of the data is not looked at in any detail.' The 'needles' are logged and the reason for holding any information has to be justified, the source said. The logs are regularly audited and subject to scrutiny by the Interception of Communications Commissioner. A ministerial warrant authorised the process of scanning the data and the work was done in a 'proportionate and legal way', the source said.","Operation Tempora sees agency storing web and telephone data for 30 days .

David Beckham could captain his country one more time against Germany to commemorate the centenary of the 1914 Christmas Day truce. The retired footballer is to be approached by the Government to mark the day British and Germans troops laid down their weapons and played football on No Man's Land. The Government wants Beckham, who acted as an ambassador for the 2012 Olympics and 2018 World Cup bids, to lead a team of British players and serving soldiers in a football match against the Germans on Boxing Day 2014. Patriotic: David Beckham has made no secret of the pride he takes in representing his country . The game would be shown live on television as a way to capture the interest of the public in the centenary of the start of the First World War. Sir Bobby Charlton and Franz Beckenbauer, who faced each other in the 1966 World Cup Final, may also be among the football legends invited to join the event, reports the Sunday Times. The Christmas Day truce saw more . than 100,000 British and German soldiers lower their guns and leave the . trenches in the mud of No Man's Land. Inspirational: The midfielder captained England to qualification for three consecutive major tournaments . Busy schedule: Beckham has recently been putting the hours in in China . In some areas, soldiers on both sides merely held their fire throughout the day. But elsewhere, troops climbed out of their trenches and exchanging gifts and handshakes and . playing football. The match finished 3-2 to the Germans, according to the diaries of Kurt Zehmisch, a soldier in the 134th Saxons. Leader: And Beckham could temporarily make a return to the role of England captain . More practically, soldiers used the time to reclaim their dead from no man's land and bury them behind the lines.

A Washington family grieving for a solider who was killed in Afghanistan nearly two years ago have learned he was actually slain by friendly fire. U.S. Army Sgt. Nathan Wyrick, a father-of four from Enumclaw, was on his second tour of duty when he was killed in October 2011. The Defense Department reported that the 34-year-old died from 'combat-related injuries'. But nearly two years on, a Freedom of Information Act request has revealed that a mortar round intended for an insurgent malfunctioned and landed on Wyrick's tent, killing him. 'You know that they're in harm's way, . but you don't expect this,' Ron Smith, Wyrick's father-in-law, told KOMO 4. 'He was a supply sergeant, he . wasn't a frontline infantryman.' Loss: US Army Sgt. Nathan Wyrick, 34, was killed when a mortar malfunctioned and landed on his tent . The truth of his death came to light after The News Tribune submitted a Freedom of Information request for the details surrounding the incident involving the 10th Mount Third Brigade. It revealed that after an insurgent fired on the base on October 10, 2011, Wyrick's fellow soldiers began deploying rounds, even though they could not see their attacker. The response was routine and Wyrick and other soldiers were waiting out the battle in their tents. The first rounds appeared to land where the team believed the insurgent was hiding. But one of the rounds landed on Sgt. Wyrick’s tents directly above his bed, while two others landed close by. He was left with a fatal chest wound and six other soldiers were injured. At work: The Army said that Wyrick, who was on his second deployment, died from 'combat related injuries' Left behind: Wyrick was a devoted family man to his wife Rachel and their four young sons . Friendly fire deaths are common in combat, but the Defense Department has not released an official number from Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2009, The Pentagon released reports showing that 0.78 per cent of Iraq casualties and 1.24 per cent of Afghanistan casualties were caused by friendly fire. It noted that only 24 of the 3,059 U.S. Army soldiers killed in Iraq since 2003 died by fratricide. But Salon, which published the data, questioned whether this was reliable. It noted that this number is far less Army studies showing that friendly fire likely caused up to 16 per cent of fatal casualties in World War II, 7 percent in the Korean War, 14 percent in Vietnam and 24 percent in the Gulf War. 'After we found out what happened we just sat there in shock,' one of the soldiers wrote in the report. A military inquiry into the incident concluded that the soldiers 'appropriately followed procedures and that the calculations directing the rounds to their intended targets also were correct'. While the information was not released to the public, the Army did not withhold it . from Wyrick's widow, Rachel - but she waited nearly a year, until August 2012, before she was ready to hear the truth in a full briefing from the Army. Wyrick left behind Rachel and their four sons. He had each of their names tattooed on his body. 'You don't find a lot of hands-on dads,' Rachel, 37, told The News Tribune. 'He was so . good with kids, and he was such a good person to me. He's awesome. He's . my best friend.' Missed: Wyrick's family are still struggling to come to terms with their loss more than a year and a half later . His father-in-law added: 'I . know that happens in war, but what a disappointment that his life was . lost because of someones, perhaps, fault or mistake.' Wyrick was born in Palm . Springs, California and grew up in the Puyallup, Washington area before moving to Enumclaw. He worked as an electrician before joining the Army to support his family. He was first deployed to Iraq between 2008 and 2009. He was a supply specialist who was supporting Operation Enduring Freedom when he died.","US Army Sgt Nathan Wyrick died from stomach wounds in October 2011 .

This year, however, it seems the real fireworks will be off-court – at least if Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova have anything to do with it. The players, two of the best in the world, have become embroiled in an extraordinary cat-fight ahead of this year’s tournament, which begins today. Scroll down for video . New couple: Maria Sharapova out with her boyfriend Grigor Dimitrov, who is believed to be Serena Williams' ex . Their fierce professional rivalry has grown increasingly bitter since Russian star Miss Sharapova started going out with Bulgarian tennis player Grigor Dimitrov, 22, whom Miss Williams is believed to have dated. Yesterday defending Wimbledon champion Miss Williams, 31, tried to calm the row at a press conference on the eve of the tournament. It began after she gave an interview to an American magazine in which she called an unnamed player, believed to be Miss Sharapova, ‘boring’. ‘She begins every interview with, “I’m so happy. I’m so lucky.” It’s so boring,’ Miss Williams said. ‘She’s still not going to be invited to the cool parties. And hey, if she wants to be with the guy with a black heart [Dimitrov], go for it.’ Public spat: Serena Williams, pictured at a press conference on Sunday, has said if Miss Sharapova wants a man with a 'black heart' she should 'go for it' At the weekend Miss Sharapova responded by pointing out that Miss Williams is believed to be dating her married tennis coach, Patrick Mouratoglu, 43. The 26-year-old Russian-born star said: ‘If Serena wants to talk about something personal, she should talk about her relationship and her boyfriend who was married, who is getting a divorce and who has kids – and not draw attention to other things.’ The pair have had a notoriously competitive relationship on the court, fuelled by the fact Miss Sharapova, the world number three, has not beaten her rival in nine years. Yesterday Miss Williams said she had ‘no comment’ on whether she felt disturbed by Miss Sharapova’s dig at her personal life. But asked if she felt the player was ‘trying to attack her mentally because she couldn’t touch her on court,’ Miss Williams seemed to agree. Instagrammed: Miss Williams posted this picture of herself and old flame Grigor Dimitrov last year . She also told the press conference that she had apologised to Miss Sharapova over the row on Thursday, when they both attended a glamorous pre-tournament party in Kensington. However, in a thinly veiled challenge, she said she was looking forward to seeing Miss Sharapova on court during the championship. She said: ‘I personally talked to Maria at the player party, incidentally. I said, “Look, I want to personally apologise to you if you are offended by being brought into my situation. ‘I want to take this moment to just pour myself, be open, say I’m very sorry for this whole situation.’ She added: ‘I have the most respect for Maria on and off the court. That’s another reason why, being a woman, I wanted to reach out to her and say, “Look, this is this, this is this, sorry”.’ She said she thought Miss Sharapova ‘definitely did accept’ her apology, saying: ‘we always have great conversations.’ Miss Williams said that having Mr Mouratoglu as her coach had made her more motivated after she crashed out of the French Open last year.","Female tennis aces Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova in catfight .

But look again and you start to see several ‘tells’ throughout the image which shown continuity between the different segments (the blue chair, table lamp, mop handle, etc) that prove it is actually a single photo full of cleverly arranged objects to create the optical illusion of being four separates.

On first impressions this colorful image looks like a clever montage, but look again and you start to see several 'tells' which shown continuity between the different segments including the blue chair, table lamp and mop handle . Rather than using photoshop or some other post processing technique, he created the image by painstakingly arranging the items via a process of trial and error and looking at the scene through the viewfinder of his camera until the illusion was just right. Through the careful positioning of objects and their edges, Borsodi was able to make a single static scene look like four separate photographs that were placed side-by-side. It was created as the album cover for the band VLP's latest release ‘Terrain.’ ‘I love making things and putting things in an unusual context incorporating various visual languages coming from art and graphic design–eroticism is also a fascination of me that I love exploring,’ said Austrian-born Borsodi.

The writer and socialite was seen laden down with bags from the upmarket supermarket chain, who she joined as a columnist in March, as she shopped in West London. No doubt the tennis fan was stocking up on strawberries and cream in advance of the Wimbledon championship, which begins today. Writer and socialite Pippa Middleton was seen laden down with Waitrose bags in London on Sunday . And strawberries and cream seemed to be the inspiration behind her wacky wardrobe choice. The 29-year-old wore a coral cashmere dress and cardigan combination by London label Cashmere by Tania. Although the twinset was unfortunately ageing on sporty young Pippa as she made a dash to the supermarket the £265 Trixiebelle bodycon dress is described by the company as exuding 'true feminine elegancy ... perfect for a dressed-up dinner.' The online description continues: 'This simple and elegant short sleeved dress, binds into the waist with a combination of cashmere and silk to enhance on the figure for that perfect looking body.' The matching £235 cardigan is described as the perfect 'cute cardigan for Spring.' The Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister often raises eyebrows with her rather dowdy styling and the unflattering woolen dress seemed a strange choice for a trip to the shops, especially when teamed with a pair of canvas pumps. Healthy Pippa had purchased some Lambs Lettuce salad, and may also have stocked up on strawberries and cream ahead of the Wimbledon tennis tournament which starts today . The £265 cardigan and £265 dress are by London label Cashmere by Tania . On Saturday the writer, who has also landed a deal as a contributor for glossy U.S. magazine Vanity Fair, showed off a rather more sophisticated side though as she attended the society wedding of Lady Melissa and Thomas van Straubenzee in Alnwick, Northumberland. Residents of the village thronged onto the streets to watch guests - including Princes William and Harry - make their way from the castle to the parish church for the wedding and Pippa, dressed in a stylish monochrome dress was greeted at the church gates by cries from the crowd of 'beautiful'. Later she joined 500 guests to celebrate after the service at the bride's 1000-year-old ancestral home which has doubled for Hogwarts in the Harry Potter films.

Pakistan plans to put former military dictator Pervez Musharraf on trial on charges of high treason, according to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Musharraf would face treason charges for his declaration of a state of emergency in 2007 and the suspension of constitutional rights that followed. The call from Nawaz Sharif breaks with the country's tradition that military chiefs are untouchable, even after retirement. Unprecedented: Prime Minister Sharif's (left) call for Pervez Musharraf (right) to be tried comes a month after the former military dictator returned to Pakistan from exile in Saudi Arabi and tried to contest elections . Sharif told parliament: 'Musharraf will have to answer for his guilt before the court'. In Pakistan, the maximum penalty for treason is death. The move was likely to anger the country’s powerful armed forces. Musharraf ousted Sharif in a coup 14 years ago, cutting short his second term as prime minister. Sharif was then hounded into exile in Saudi Arabia. Sharif’s decision to move against Musharraf suggests he has decided to be more assertive than the last government towards the military, which has ruled for much of Pakistan’s 66-year history. 'Notwithstanding the fact that the prime minister has borne the brunt of Musharraf’s brazen coup, he wishes to assure both this august court and the people of Pakistan that he will act according to the highest standards of justice and follow the due process of law,' Sharif read from the statement. Musharraf, a key ally of president George W. Bush in the early years of Washington’s 'war on terror', himself spent almost four years in self-imposed exile. Return: Pervez Musharraf (centre) returned to Pakistan in March after spending four years in self-imposed exile . Call to justice: A police officer leaves the Supreme Court in Islamabad today after the controversial announcement. Prime Minister Sharif's statement was presented to parliament and the Supreme Court . He returned to Pakistan hoping to contest elections in May, but was put under house arrest. His detention appeared to break an unwritten rule that the top ranks of the military are untouchable, even after they have retired. The current army chief has suggested the military is unhappy with Musharraf’s treatment. Accusations that Musharraf failed to provide enough security to prevent the assassination of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007 led to his house arrest. He denies wrongdoing in all the cases brought against him. Last month’s election brought Sharif back to office for an unprecedented third time and provided the first transition between two civilian governments in Pakistan’s turbulent history.","Musharraf to face treason charges for declaring state of emergency in 2007 .

These before and after shots from across the capital are a stark reminder of how the London property market operates within its own bubble. The dilapidated remains of theatres and hospitals, shown here in the boom years prior to the 2008 financial crash are a stark contrast to the regenerated scenes which have sprung-up during the recession. Investors have breathed new life into some of London's hidden heritage while this week, average house prices in London rocketed past the half a million mark to reach £515,243, according to Rightmove. This is supported by further government investment in the city. In August 2011, the Greater London . Authority announced a total of £120million in funds to further . regenerate the city, in the wake of devastating riots. Before: The Lambeth Hospital, Kennington, . pictured in 2008, no longer in use, and after: refurbished in 2013, the . water tower of the hospital has now been converted into apartments, . while some of the remaining hospital is still used for care services . Before: Looking in a state of disrepair, part of the Lambeth Hospital, in Kennington, South London, was derelict and overgrown in 2008 . After: Unrecognisable, the former Lambeth Hospital buildings have been replaced with apartments, pictured this year . In August 2008 - just before the financial crash and around the time of many of these 'before' shots - the average asking price for a house in London was £379,162. Today's prices are a staggering 36 per cent higher. In the 12 months to April 2013 UK house prices increased by 2.6%; annual house price increases in England were driven by a 6.0% rise in London. Excluding London and the South East, however, UK house prices increased by just 1.4% in the 12 months to April 2013. Before: Brunswick House, a Georgian mansion house in Vauxhall, pictured in 2003, disused, boarded up, covered in graffiti and looking unhappy . After: Restored to its former glory and now surrounded by new developments, the Georgian mansion house is a reminder of bygone years in Vauxhall . London's regeneration since the financial crisis is clear from its skyline. The Shard, in London Bridge opened recently to wealthy investors; ten properties within the soaring glass building are expected to fetch between £30million and £50million each. While in the east of the city, the former Olympic Park buildings have been snapped up by businesses, adding value to the local east end area. Foreign investment has largely been blamed for the inflated housing market in the capital. A . recent report by estate agent network London Property Partners revealed . as much as 85 per cent of prime London property purchases last year . were made with overseas money; just 15 per cent of its sales in the past . year were made by UK buyers. Of the foreign purchases, 80 per cent were from Europe and 20 per cent from Asia, LPP said. Photographer Paul Talling, 45, embarked . on the task of capturing images of decaying buildings ahead of their . regeneration to give an insight into the less celebrated buildings . across the city. Before: A few years ago the Kings Head pub, in Walworth, south London, closed down and became boarded up - pictured in 2009 . After: The Kings Head pub, in Walworth, has now been transformed into a William Hills bookies, pictured this year . The ten-year project, called Derelict London, has now amassed a collection of more than 2,500 images which illustrate London - for better and worse. Paul, from East Dulwich, . London, said: 'Around ten years ago as I was walking through London I . wished that I had a camera with me to snap a few of London's less . celebrated buildings that were unlikely to be around much longer. 'From then on I started wandering . around every bit of the city, often walking 15 miles a day just . capturing images of decay before regeneration takes place.

After: A distant memory, The Cundys Tavern is no more, replaced by a block of flats, pictured this year . Before: The Red Lion, in Soho, in 2008, looked in need of some love and attention. After: Still a drinking house, the Be At One venue is a well known landmark in central Soho . Before: The Dalston Theatre, once a hive of creative activity, pictured in 2005 . After: The east London theatre has gone for good, replaced with a development of 553 new homes, pictured in 2012 . 'These . places all have history not for the picture-postcard hunting tourists . but were important to people in their heyday, whether it be their home, . factory, local greasy spoon, pub, pool, hospital. 'Sometimes they are restored and . converted into alternative use, whilst still retaining some of their . former glory whilst others are demolished and replaced by flats and many . people move in without being aware of what was on the site beforehand.' Paul, a former gig promoter, tasked himself with going for long walks without maps or directions to see what interesting subjects he would stumble upon in unlikely places. From then, he researched the history of the spots in local archives and libraries and got to work. Before: The Greengate House, in Newham, which cost about £100,000, was opened in 1921 and included a theatre, swimming-bath, gymnasium, and sports ground. It was successful until the wars, and was closed and sold in 1956 . After: In the 1970s the building was part used as offices and in 2010, the interior and rear was demolished, the facade restored and modernised, and the rest converted into apartments . Before: The Old Dispensary pub in Camberwell, South London, pictured in 2008 as a sad and closed down former hang-out . After: Recognising it's charm, new owners have spruced and brightened up the building, even retaining its original name - pictured this year . His extraordinary repertoire of images includes decaying houses on the North Circular, the faded glory of the Tidal Basin Tavern in Royal Victoria Dock, Battersea Power Station and the Hoxton Theatre. The project has been so successful he not only runs guided tours but he has also created a book of his work. Paul added: 'When I started I wondered if anyone else would ever be interested in dereliction too. I thought everyone considered these places as eyesores. Before: Ashton Funeral Directors, in Clapham, South London, has been offering its services to bereaved families for 150 years before it eventually closed down . After: There is little to suggest this development, pictured in 2013, was a former funeral directors . 'But the response has been amazing. Many people emailed me requesting me to show them around and as a result I run guided tours on most Saturday afternoons. The demand for these walks has been phenomenal. Before: The London Park Hotel, In South London's Elephant and Castle, looked more of a crumbling eyesore in 2007, than a sign of former evocative times . Bygone years: Empty, boarded and gated up, the former hotel was once a well-known landmark for South London residents .

'It certainly shows the relationships between humans and their physical and social environments, and the detrimental effects of modern society on the environment.'

A former hotel manager with a ‘Jekyll and Hyde personality’ strangled his mother after researching the meaning of the word ‘garrotte’ on Wikipedia, a court heard today. Paul Stones, 38, allegedly killed accounts clerk Marian Stones, 58, as she lay in bed during a weekly argument after they repeatedly rowed about her calling him a ‘failure’ and ‘not a proper dad’. The divorced father of one moved in with his mother at her home in Sharples, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, after his relationship crumbled and he lost his job following a drink driving conviction. Investigation: Police at the scene in Sharples, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, in June 2012 where former hotel manager Paul Stones allegedly strangled his mother Marian . But Stones drank white wine and following another row knelt on Mrs Stones and strangled her as she lay in her bed, Manchester Crown Court was told. The next day he allegedly walked into a police station to tell officers he had killed his mother and gave them the house keys. Mrs Stones was found dead in bed, lying on her back under the duvet. Stones - who had been on anti-depressants - told police in a statement: ‘Your main relationship is with your mum. When she is nice and treats you like an adult you feel like you are in the top position. He added: ‘But when she is not nice you feel like you are in the bottom position.’ Stones’s laptop was seized and it was found just three days earlier he had visited Wikipedia and searched for the definition of ‘garrotte’ and used the word in a post on Facebook, the court heard. John Shorrock QC, prosecuting, said: ‘He said he had been sat watching TV with his mother but said his memories were hazy that evening. ‘He said that he was aware he had argued with his mother but was unable to recall the topic. He states that his mother would argue and she knew what buttons to press. ‘He stated that he recalls being in his mother’s bedroom knelt on top of her holding her down with his hands around her neck. He was asked why and said “I still don’t know”. At the scene: Stones drank white wine and following another row knelt on Mrs Stones and strangled her as she lay in her bed, Manchester Crown Court was told . ‘He did say he realised he did it with his own hands and was having to live with it for the rest of his life and “I want to be punished for it”. The computer had been used to search the word “garrotte”. ‘At about the same time he used this word to post something on Facebook. It is an odd word, “garrotte”. Why was the defendant interested in that word?’ 'He stated that he recalls being in his mother's bedroom knelt on top of her holding her down with his hands around her neck. He was asked why and said ""I still don’t know""' John Shorrock QC, prosecuting . The court heard that Mrs Stones had brought up her son single-handedly after divorcing from her husband in 1977 when he was aged two. In adult life he was said to have anger management issues with ex-wife Emma Hindsley describing him as having a ‘Jekyll and Hyde personality’. Mr Shorrock added: ‘She said he would be kind and charming and the loveliest man and other times someone she was scared and frightened of - a man who could lose his temper in drink, kicking doors and pulling wallpaper off.’ The marriage crumbled in 2005 when he allegedly kicked and punched Miss Hindsley during a row when she was in bed. He started a relationship with another woman Claire Nichols and they had a baby daughter in 2008, but the romance ended when he assaulted her too, it was claimed. He also lost his job after drink driving and moved in with his mother, the court heard. Probe: Stones's laptop was seized and it was found just three days earlier he had visited Wikipedia and searched for the definition of 'garrotte' and used the word in a post on Facebook, the court heard . Mrs Stones made a 999 call in 2010 reporting that her son had punched her in the face after returning home drunk, the jury was told. She told the operator she was ‘really scared’ but allegedly did not make a complaint for fear it would jeopardise her relationship with her granddaughter. Mr Shorrock said: ‘The defendant is a man who has a drink problem. When in drink he becomes aggressive and loses his temper and as a result three people closest to him during that period have been assaulted.’ 'I thought I ought to say something. I said I did it - I strangled my mother. I realised what I had done and went to the police. I am totally remorseful and regret what I have done' Paul Stones .
