"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Whether they've been good or bad, some dogs visited Santa this holiday season to get their photos taken with the jolly but unfamiliar bearded man in a red suit. It's 1-year-old Max's first time, owner Janice Sims said of her Australian shepherd, ""but he's not afraid of Santa like my kids were."" She planned to hang his photo on her Christmas tree. It was also a first Santa visit for Gizmo. The 11-month-old puppy arrived a little after the holidays last year as a gift for 4-year-old Naomi. ""I never wanted a dog,"" remembered mom Jewel Washington. ""But I guess I swallowed the Kool-Aid,"" she laughingly said as she and her daughter Naomi tried to get their dog to look the camera. They are giving Gizmo a lighted leash for Christmas. Check out holiday shopping special coverage . There is a lot of laughter and fun in the whole process. Dogs greeted and played with each other while they waited for their turn with Santa. Owners -- some of whom were shopping when they just happened upon the photo session -- helped volunteers pose the dogs with Santa. Nikko has gotten his holiday photo taken for eight years in a row. Owner Sophia Henry said she does it because her own mother enjoys getting the pooch's picture as a gift every holiday. Avoid holiday pitfalls with pets . But before anyone gets all ""Scroogey"" about a waste of money in hard times, many of the pet and St. Nick pictures taken across the country raise money to help not-so-lucky animals. FurKids, a no-kill animal rescue organization, provides a Santa and photographers at PetSmart stores around Atlanta. The organization sponsored several ""Santa Claws"" events in Tucker, Georgia, this month. A $5 donation bought a framed digital photo of the owner's choice with as many critters that can squeeze into Santa's lap or on his bench. Santa ""Mike"" has volunteered his lap every December for a half a dozen years to raise money for FurKids so the charity can save abandoned cats and dogs and get them adopted. He's experienced only one ""damp"" visit, when a dog last year watered his boots. But he also put his foot down when faced with a 170-pound Rottweiler. He told the owners, ""I'll sit in his lap, but you're not setting him on my lap."" However, his most unusual pet picture over the years was with a 10-foot boa constrictor draped over him. Doguroo, a doggie day care and grooming center, sponsored several Santa photo sessions in front of a huge sparkling tree at Central Park in Atlanta's Atlantic Station's this December. Any critter -- including two-legged ones -- could get their photo taken with Santa for a $10 donation to the Atlanta Humane Society. Doguroo owners Eileen Kelly and Jean Finney brought along their very sweet pit bull mix, Lottie, wearing a colorful collar with bells, who patiently sat on the sofa with dogless humans who wanted a critter in their photo with Santa. Lottie also submitted to petting by happy children. All she demanded was an occasional treat. Santa ""Jimmy"" visited with children all day at Dillard's at Atlantic Station, before taking up his post out in front of the tree in the park, as he does on weekend evenings. His most memorable experience this year was having the front legs of 170-pound Great Dane draped over his lap. Sherie and Britt Layman brought their 1Â½-year-old canine cocktail, Loretta (aka Mrs. Santa Paws), for a photo. Katie Fisher had a double challenge for Santa -- Simon and Gigi, both dogs around 2 years old. She said the two pups will be getting lots of treats, tennis balls and sweaters for Christmas. And one pet owner brought her three dogs decked out in their festive red and white outfits. The Humane Society of New York held a Toys for Dogs event this year, where pets could get their photo taken with Santa in exchange for donated toys for homeless dogs. Director Sandra DeFeo says it's less of a ""fund raiser"" and more of a ""fun raiser"" with ""good cheer, sweets and holiday drinks."" ""We always bring dogs available for adoption,"" DeFeo said. Donations go to support the animal shelter and free clinic. Pet owners bring mostly dogs, but an occasional cat or bird drops in to join the festivities. But DeFeo says it's not only small creatures sniffing around at these parties. She has seen some single pet owners checking each other out. And, she says, a particularly handsome Santa was a big attraction one year.","Santa and pet photos are great fundraisers for animal charities .

"North Korea has completed all of the preliminary steps required to conduct a nuclear test, a South Korean government official said. The South detected the closure of the entrance of a tunnel at the Punggye-ri site in a northeastern region of North Korea. It means that Pyongyang is now ready for what could be its fourth nuclear test, the official said. ""This is the final step in preparing to test a nuclear device,"" the official said Thursday. ""In theory, there are seven to 14 days to conduct a test once the entrance is sealed."" The official added that it was highly likely the North would test an enriched uranium device, as it does not seem to possess a lot of plutonium. The official also said the North might launch a long-range ballistic missile instead, if it decided not to conduct a nuclear test. This would ""show off their two-way track capability,"" the official said. Asked if the North had been able to construct a nuclear weapon small enough to fit on a missile, the official said: ""We believe that North Korea has made a considerable progress in technology to miniaturize the nuclear warhead and that they are really doing their best. In fact, North Korea is spending a substantial amount of money and time (on this)."" The comments came the day before U.S. President Barack Obama arrived in South Korea as part of a visit to several Asian countries. Obama was previously in Japan and continues on to Malaysia on Saturday. In an interview with a South Korean newspaper ahead of his arrival Friday, Obama warned Pyongyang over the possibility of carrying out a new test. ""If North Korea were to make the mistake of engaging in another nuclear test, it should expect a firm response from the international community,"" Obama told Joonang Ilbo. The North Korean Foreign Ministry earlier this week described Obama's trip as ""a reactionary and dangerous one as it is aimed to escalate confrontation and bring dark clouds of a nuclear arms race to hang over this unstable region."" South Korea's Defense Ministry said this week it had increased its military preparedness since Monday morning and was monitoring around the clock for signs of activity at the Punggye-ri site. North Korea announced last month that it wouldn't rule ""a new form of a nuclear test"" to strengthen its nuclear deterrent capabilities. Experts have speculated that that could refer to the testing of a uranium bomb. The reclusive regime in Pyongyang is known to have conducted three previous tests, all of them believed to be based on plutonium. The most recent one took place February 2013. The past tests prompted international condemnation and the imposition of sanctions aimed at hampering the North's weapons program. Since the last underground detonation, South Korean officials have repeatedly said that they believe North Korea is ready to carry out another test at any time, pending a political decision to go ahead with it.","South Korea official: North Korea ready for nuclear test .

"If at first you don't succeed, discuss. A day after Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a ""religious freedom"" bill that critics say would have allowed businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians, a supporter of the bill said that community appeared to need no special protection, thank you very much. ""Where are the examples of gays being discriminated against?"" Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, asked CNN's Chris Cuomo, in an interview on ""New Day"" that became a spirited discussion of marriage. ""If they're so discriminated against, how come they make more money than straight people, on average?"" In fact, at least one survey has shown that gays and lesbians tend to earn more, save more, owe less and better prepare for retirement. Cuomo reversed the question to ask why people of faith would need special protection. He noted that proponents of the law had been unable to cite a single example of a business in Arizona that was forced to do something that would have violated the religious beliefs of its owner. ""You didn't need the law,"" Cuomo said. Referring to a court case that required a photo service in New Mexico to document a same-sex wedding ceremony, the anchor asked how the Catholic photographer could have found that job to be a substantial burden to his faith. Donohue contended it was. ""I think, if people say, 'Listen, I don't want to sanction polygamy or gay marriage or anything other than traditional marriage,' I think we need to respect that,"" he said. ""And if you don't like it, you can shop around. It's not hard for gays to find somebody to take a picture of them."" People of faith, he said, feel that their rights ""are being whittled away in the name of gay rights."" ""You need love"" Donohue then moved on from the Arizona law to take aim at same-sex marriage in general. ""It basically says that there is no profound difference, socially speaking, between a man and woman -- the only union that can create a family."" Cuomo noted that some people marry not to have children but because they seek life-long companionship and commitment. ""You don't have to be married to propagate,"" he noted. ""And you don't have to have kids to be married."" Why should heterosexual marriage be considered any different than gay marriage, he asked. Citing his education as a sociologist, Donohue had a ready answer: because heterosexual marriage is in the best interest of society. ""Kids do best in an intact family,"" he said. ""The evidence is overwhelming: you need a father and a mother."" ""You need love,"" responded Cuomo. ""And you need people to care for you -- gay or straight."" That rationale -- that love is all that's needed as a condition for marriage -- could lead to a brother and sister tying the knot, Donohue said. ""That's where we're going with this thing -- polygamists, also."" Donohue said gays and lesbians have individual rights, but contended that ""the institution of marriage is best set when we have kids raised by a father and a mother."" He then went a step further: ""Maybe Tom, Dick and Harry want to get married. What are you going to say about that?"" Donohue acknowledged that he could offer no evidence that children of gay or lesbian couples have outcomes any different from those of heterosexual parents, but said that was because the research had not been completed. ""Why would we want a social experiment with an institution that has served us well for over 2,000 years?"" he asked. ""The gold standard is a father and a mother creating a family. That's what was ordained by nature, and nature's God."" Not true, said Cuomo, noting that the putative gold standard has been tarnished by a divorce rate of about 50%, broken homes and latchkey kids. And nature ordaining marriage? Most mammals do not couple for life, he noted. Donohue clung to his assertion. ""Have you noticed anatomically there's a goodness of fit between a man and a woman?"" he asked. Cuomo stood fast. ""Nobody's arguing that this is how you procreate, but marriage is about love and commitment and the right to it is about equality -- and you know that."" Donohue: Marriage based on duty and commitment . ""Marriage is about family -- it's not about love,"" Donohue said. ""Two sisters can love each other."" ""Marriage is not about love?"" an incredulous Cuomo asked. ""Are you married?"" Donohue, who has been widely reported to be a divorced father of two adult children, did not address that question, but moved on. ""Marriage has always been based, historically, on duty and on commitment,"" he said. ""The duty, the commitment grow out of love,"" responded Cuomo. ""If they love each other, that's great,"" said Donohue. ""It can't be the condition -- otherwise, you can sanction all kinds of things."" The two men then returned to the topic that started their discussion. ""In Arizona, there was no legal force making business owners do business with gay people if they don't want to,"" Cuomo said. ""So the law, fundamentally, was unnecessary. The governor said it; that's why she vetoed it. The bigger proposition is why do you want to discriminate against gays?"" Donohue said he did not want to discriminate against gays as individuals, only as part of married couples. ""But that's the same thing,"" said Cuomo. ""Because their right as an individual is to marry. You do not own marriage. It was not developed by Christians. It is a civil institution, secular. If they are equal, they have equal rights."" Donohue ceded no ground, saying he had plenty of allies. ""I have Christianity, I have Judaism, I have the Muslims, I have Mormons, I have most of the world who regard this idea as being bizarre that two men should get married."" Cuomo then drew a distinction between the Arizona law and Pope Francis, the leader of the Catholic Church, who has refused to judge gays. ""He's saying forgive and he's saying include. That's not what that law was about, and that's not what you're saying."" ""I do believe that people ought to love gays as we would straights,"" Donahue said. ""I'm all in favor of that, and discrimination against gays is wrong."" ""I'm making a distinction between individuals,"" Donahue added. ""You're bleeding the individual into the institution. I think, sociologically, that's not correct.""","""Have you noticed, anatomically, there's a goodness of fit between a man and a woman?"" asks Donohue .

"LONDON, England -- A Colombian sculptor has created a mystery at London's Tate Modern gallery by refusing to reveal how she seemingly managed to crack open a concrete floor. ""Shibboleth"" is Colombian artist Doris Salcedo's first public commission in the United Kingdom. The work by Doris Salcedo begins as a hairline crack then widens and deepens as it snakes across the full 167 meters (548 feet) of the former power station's Turbine Hall. Salcedo said ""Shibboleth,"" a statement about racism, took her more than a year to make but has revealed little else about its construction. She apparently created it elsewhere and spent the past five weeks installing it in the Tate, on the south bank of the River Thames. She refused to say how she managed seemingly to crack open a concrete floor. ""What is important is the meaning of the piece. The making of it is not important,"" she said. Asked how deep the crack goes, she replied: ""It's bottomless. It's as deep as humanity."" Visitors meanwhile are warned not to trip on the crack. Tate director Nicholas Serota insisted the work was no optical illusion. ""This sculpture has been made in the most painstaking, meticulous way by Doris and her team before it was slowly inserted into the Turbine Hall,"" he told the Press Association. ""It has taken five weeks of work here with very considerable disruption to the hall. It's not an illusion - it's there, it's real. ""From the Tate's point of view, there were only two questions: could we realize it in the way Doris envisaged? And once the piece was created, would it damage the structural integrity of the building forever? ""The answer to the first was yes, and to the second was no."" He declined to elaborate further. The installation will be removed next April by filling in the crack. Serota said: ""There is a crack, there is a line, and eventually there will be a scar and that scar will remain. It will remain as a memory of the work and also as a memorial to the issues Doris touches on."" The artist said the work of art represents the gap between white Europeans and the rest of humanity. Wire mesh is on show because it is ""the most common means of control used to define borders and divisions."" Salcedo said of the work: ""It represents borders, the experience of immigrants, the experience of segregation, the experience of racial hatred. ""It is the experience of a Third World person coming into the heart of Europe. ""For example, the space which illegal immigrants occupy is a negative space. And so this piece is a negative space.""

"Sen. John McCain is prodding the Justice Department to wrap up its two-year-old investigation into David Petraeus, the former Army general and Central Intelligence Agency director. McCain, the Arizona Republican who will helm the Senate Armed Services Committee once new lawmakers take office in January, wrote a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder on Tuesday asking for a ""fair and timely"" conclusion to the case. He questioned the pace of the investigation into whether Petraeus inappropriately shared information with Paula Broadwell, his mistress who was also writing a biography of the former leader of U.S. military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""At this critical moment in our nation's security, Congress and the American people cannot afford to have this voice silenced or curtailed by the shadow of a long-running, unresolved investigation marked by leaks from anonymous sources,"" McCain wrote. Petraeus resigned in 2012, citing his affair. But he hasn't faded from the public eye. He's maintained his security clearances and backed President Barack Obama's plan to escalate the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria this fall. Timeline of the Petraeus affair . He's also joined the investment firm KKR and has taken roles with Harvard University, the University of Southern California, the University of Exeter, Team Rubicon and the Royal United Services Institute. McCain said he regretted wading into an ongoing investigation, and said he wouldn't judge whether Petraeus should face charges -- only that he wanted a quick conclusion. ""Without commenting on the underlying merits or anticipating the outcome of the investigation, I can conclude this is a circumstance in which the principle of 'justice delayed is justice denied' is certainly at play, and that this matter needs to be brought to resolution,"" McCain wrote. ""Furthermore, the fact that you and others within your department have weighed-in publicly on the case raises questions about whether this investigation is being handled in a fundamentally fair and appropriate manner,"" he wrote.","Sen.

"Gay conservatives are undertaking the most coordinated effort yet to change the Republican Party's position on same-sex marriage. Their approach: one state and one Republican activist at a time. While the official stance of the Republican Party says the ""the union of one man and one woman must be upheld as the national standard,"" conservative same-sex marriage advocates want to change that. Young Conservatives for Freedom to Marry hopes that by the time the Republican convention rolls around in 2016, they will have recruited or persuaded enough like-minded party activists and young conservatives to remove the restrictive language and replace it with this: ""We encourage and welcome a thoughtful conversation among Republicans about the meaning and importance of marriage, and commit our Party to respect for all families and fairness and freedom for all Americans."" To accomplish that goal, Freedom to Marry, a nonpartisan advocacy group, has launched a national grassroots campaign targeting Republican activists -- the most powerful impediment to marriage freedom in the party -- in key presidential nominating states that they can ""agree to disagree"" on same-sex marriage. Tyler Deaton, campaign manager at Young Conservatives for Freedom to Marry, said they are not looking for an endorsement of same-sex marriage, ""but that it's a valid point of view."" Their campaign is targeted and funded. They have launched in the first four and arguably most influential of the presidential nominating states: New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada and South Carolina. And the national organization Freedom to Marry has committed $1 million to the effort. Young Conservatives thinks that momentum is on its side. More Republicans are announcing their support for same-sex marriage. Three openly gay Republicans ran for Congress this year (one lost in the primaries) and Republican lawmakers are slowly announcing their support. In addition, Young Conservatives point to a New York Times public opinion poll that shows 40% of Republicans -- and 56% of Republicans under age 45 -- support same-sex marriage. The group just completed its lobbying campaign in Nevada, which might be their easiest stop, since the state party, which leans libertarian, has officially made marriage a non-issue by stripping all social issues from its platform. Libertarian-minded Republican Clark County Assemblywoman Michele Fiore said she is working with Young Conservatives to convince the national Republican Party to follow Nevada's lead. ""If we truly are the party of freedom, we need to be the party of choice,"" Fiore, who was raised by a lesbian couple in Brooklyn, New York, told CNN. But not all states share Nevada's view and not all local Republican chapters are run by libertarians. In Iowa, for instance, where Christian conservatives are a dominant force in the party, resistance is certain. ""Any entity is more than welcome to try and make their case,"" Jeff Kaufmann, chairman of the Iowa Republican Party said, ""but marriage certainly is a difficult swallow for our rank and file."" Young Conservatives' next stop is South Carolina, another state with a socially conservative Republican base. Deaton, who is from the South and is gay, says he understands evangelicals' and Southerners' concerns and believe that he has the ability to at least soften their opposition. We'll find out when the GOP finalizes its platform in Cleveland in the summer of 2016.","Gay conservatives are undertaking the most coordinated effort yet to change the GOP's position on same-sex marriage .

"It wasn't supposed to turn into a cold case mystery -- or possibly solve a couple, for that matter -- when Highway Patrol Trooper George Hoyle took new sonar equipment out to an Oklahoma lake on a training mission last week. But boy have things changed. The discovery of two submerged cars -- probably there for decades -- and the six bodies inside them have folks in western Oklahoma wondering whether two old mysteries can now be put aside. The biggest question remains unanswered. How did the cars -- which faced different directions -- come to be in the lake? The cars turned out to be a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro and a 1952 Chevrolet, sitting just 50 feet from a marina and 12 feet underwater. Lake levels are now 13 feet below normal because of a drought. Their discovery was certainly a surprise. Hoyle was testing the high-tech sonar on September 10 when he saw something he didn't expect at the bottom of Foss Lake. ""I noticed that they were cars with this side-scan sonar,"" he said. ""It puts off a very good image and very detailed. I knew for a fact they were cars and they were pretty close to one another."" The cars appear to match the descriptions of the vehicles in two cases that have remained mysteries for decades. Custer County Sheriff Bruce Peoples told KOCO that one of the cars, the Camaro, may have belonged to 16-year-old Jimmy Williams, a Sayre teenager who disappeared in 1970 with two friends: Thomas Rios and Leah Johnson, both 18. The three teenagers went missing the night of November 20, 1970, when they went for a ride around Sayre in Williams' blue Camaro with a white top, according to the Doe Network, a volunteer organization that helps law enforcement solve cold cases. Williams bought the used Camaro just six days before he went missing, and the muscle car was the envy of teenage boys at the time, said Dayva Spitzer, publisher of the Sayre Record and Beckham County Democrat newspaper. Johnson was Native American and, according to Spitzer, was said to be a descendent of Sitting Bull, the legendary Indian chief who led defeated Lt. Col. George Custer  in the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876. Local residents regarded Johnson as an Indian princess, Spitzer said. Williams and his two passengers were supposed to go to a football game, but they may have gone hunting instead, Spitzer said. Williams was a hunter, Spitzer said, and in fact, two rifles were found, rusted and corroded, in the Camaro. The three teens never returned home. At the time, the family posted a $500 reward in the local newspaper for ""information leading to the finding of Jimmy Williams and subsequent meeting his parents,"" with a phone number. Tipsters could collect, the ad says. More recently, Williams' brother Gary, who works on an offshore oil rig, raised the reward to $10,000 in 2009, Spitzer said. Tantalizing clues emerged this week: The Camaro was found with all four windows rolled down and appeared to have entered the water backwards. The other car, a Chevy, was found with the driver's side door open. Sheriff Peoples hasn't ruled out foul play, but he suggested this week that all six deaths were likely accidents. Debbie McManaman said she believes the older car contains the remains of her grandfather, John Alva Porter. Porter, then 69, was traveling in a green Chevy with a sibling, Alrie Porter, and friend Nora Marie Duncan, 58, on April 8, 1969, when they all went missing, said Mike Nance, regional system administrator for the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System. McManaman said she used to bring her kids out to the lake to skip rocks. She said she had no idea that the answer and the clues to her grandfather's disappearance may have been just feet away underwater. In fact, over the years, when she and her kids drove by the lake, they wondered aloud if grandpa was in the lake, she said. ""Maybe that's where he's at,"" she said. The year he disappeared had a lot of rain, perhaps allowing a deeper lake to hide its secrets better, she said. Authorities didn't know what they had until Tuesday, when they sent down Darrell Splawn, a diver with the Highway Patrol's underwater search and recovery team. And even then, it was tough to know anything for certain. Visibility is only about 4 inches at the bottom of the lake. There's lots of murky muck to sift through. ""You can't see anything,"" Splawn said. ""You basically just go down there and feel with your hands.  It's just a blind feel."" Still, he found a shoe, so they attached a tow cable and pulled the cars out. ""It didn't really cross my mind as to a body being in it,"" Splawn said.  ""It could have been a shoe, but whenever we brought them up to the shore ... you could see the skeletal remains in them."" A second search by the diver found a skull and a few other bones. Oklahoma deputies pull bodies from lake; may date to '60s, 1970 disappearances . Positive identification of the bodies could take years, authorities warn. They'll try to match DNA evidence if possible. The DNA testing will take place at the University of North Texas Health Science Center, which already has DNA samples from Duncan's relatives, said spokesman J. Todd Matthews. A muddy wallet and purse could hold some clues. While the scientists look for answers, the troopers hope they've provided some peace of mind. ""We are very fortunate to get to help these people and give their family closure, for they have lost loved ones,"" said Trooper Hoyle, who talked to the brother of one person missing for more than four decades. ""They didn't know that they were kidnapped or how they'd become missing, but I do believe that we gave them some closure ... so that they can have some resolve and serenity in their own lives.""

"After days of protests and related violence, concerns are growing that furor over an anti-Islam video could intensify even more Friday -- threatening U.S. interests abroad and at home. People have taken to the streets in 10 nations and the Indian-controlled region of Kashmir, according to U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, railing against ""Innocence of Muslims"" and the nation where it was produced, the United States. This outrage, and danger to Americans, could worsen in the coming days, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and FBI warned Thursday in a joint intelligence bulletin. ""The risk of violence could increase both at home and abroad as the film continues to gain attention,"" the U.S. agencies said. ""Additionally, we judge that violent extremist groups in the United States could exploit anger over the film to advance their recruitment efforts."" American tourists cautious, but undeterred . Worries about Friday, in particular, stem from the fact Muslims hold weekly prayers that day -- and may congregate afterward and march on U.S. diplomatic missions. ""We are in a full-court press at every single one of the posts in the Middle East and anywhere else there is any chance of demonstrations after Friday services to make sure nothing bad happens. And to have the security in place in case bad things do happen,"" one senior U.S. official said. The ongoing unrest centers on an obscure 14-minute film trailer that mocks Islam's prophet. Posted in July on YouTube, it got more notice recently after Egyptian television aired segments and anti-Islam activists promoted it online. Numerous questions surround the film, which includes cartoonish scenes of Mohammed as a womanizer, child molester and ruthless killer. According to a FBI/Homeland Security joint statement, the film's producer identified himself to news media as an Israeli -- an assertion Israel's government denies -- and falsely claimed the movie was financed with help from more than 100 Jewish donors. While he'd been identified in July 2011 by various names, including Sam Bassiel, federal officials now say they believe the filmmaker's name is Nakoula Basseley Nakoula. He was convicted in 2009 of bank fraud, with the indictment from the U.S. Attorney's Office listing seven aliases. A production staffer said he believed the filmmaker was a Coptic Christian who also went by the name Abenob Nakoula Bassely. Analysis: In Libya, militias 'running the show' On Tuesday, the same day people protesting the film stormed the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was attacked -- leading to the deaths of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, State Department computer expert Sean Smith, and security officers Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods, both former Navy SEAL commandos. In addition to stressing there's no excuse for violence targeting U.S. diplomatic missions, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called the video ""disgusting and reprehensible"" and said it appears to aim ""to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage."" Still, condemnations of the film and calls by leaders of largely Muslim countries not to assault U.S. diplomatic missions haven't stopped throngs from demonstrating, at times violently. Protests rage against inflammatory anti-Islam film trailer . Small and large demonstrations have occurred in recent days all around North Africa and the Middle East. While some protesters say they have not seen any of the online film, they were incensed by reports of its depiction of the Prophet Mohammed. Many of them directed their anger, too, at the U.S. government and its Israeli allies. In Cairo, for instance, a photo showed a man standing over chalk-writing, in Arabic, that read, ""Remember your black day 11 September."" Here are details about various protests: . -- In Yemen, demonstrators breached a security wall at the U.S. Embassy as several thousand people protested outside. Four protesters died during clashes with security forces outside the embassy, according to Yemeni security officials. Twenty-four security force members were reported injured, as were 11 protesters, according to Yemen's Defense Ministry, security officials and eyewitnesses. -- In Egypt, site of one of the largest, longest-lasting protests, at least 13 civilians and six police officers were injured Thursday, according to Egyptian government officials. Throngs continued to pack the area in front of the Cairo embassy on Friday morning, as a large fire burned and security guarded the area. The instability in Egypt is a primary concern to U.S. President Barack Obama, who warned in an interview with Telemundo that it would be ""a real big problem"" if Egypt's leaders fail to protect American interests there. -- In Tunisia and Morocco, protesters massed in front of U.S. embassies. -- In Gaza City, Palestinians demonstrated outside U.N. headquarters, and about 200 Palestinians protested the film at the Palestine Legislative Council building. In one instance, Palestinian men burned a U.S. flag. -- In Tel Aviv, Israel, about 50 people demonstrated in front of the U.S. Embassy. -- Iranians protested near the Swiss Embassy in Tehran on Thursday. Switzerland represents U.S. interests in Iran, since Washington and Tehran do not have diplomatic relations. Up to 500 people chanted ""Death to America!"" and called for death to the director of the movie. The Islamic Propagation Coordination Council, meanwhile, has issued a statement calling for rallies across Iran on Friday ""to protest Zionist-U.S. plots against Muslim and Islamic values,"" the state-run IRNA news agency reported. -- In Iraq, specifically in the predominantly Shiite area of eastern Baghdad known as Sadr City, hundreds of protesters hit the streets to protest the film. They chanted, ""America is the enemy of the people,"" with some burning an American flag. Other followers of radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr also protested in the provinces of Najaf and Karbala. So far, the violence has not spread to Afghanistan, where there is a high potential for outrage to erupt into destabilizing chaos. Obama and his Afghan counterpart, Hamid Karzai, have expressed their commitment to prevent that from happening. The Afghan government has ordered an indefinite block of YouTube to prevent people there from watching the clips and staging violent protests. YouTube has already restricted access to the video. Attention in the United States turns to filmmaker . U.S. officials have stepped up their criticism of the film at the center of the protests, which was privately produced in the United States. Reaction fuels debate on free speech vs. hate speech . The FBI has spoken to the elusive man behind the film within the past 24 hours, a federal law enforcement officer told CNN on Thursday. Feinstein, head of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said she believes ""an investigation is going on in this country considering the individual who did this very obnoxious ... preview to some very stupid, ... wrong-headed movie."" Many Muslims find any depiction of Mohammed to be offensive. A Danish newspaper's publication in 2005 of Mohammed caricatures triggered riots -- and derogatory depictions of the prophet are considered by some to be worse. The production staffer on the movie said the filmmaker was a Coptic Christian who had gone to Alexandria, Egypt, where the Coptic church is based, to raise money for the film. Far from standing behind the film, the Coptic church has issued a statement calling it ""abusive"" and part of a ""malicious campaign to divide people."" Quest for ""justice"" after U.S. ambassador's killing . Sources tracking militant Islamist groups in eastern Libya say Tuesday night's deadly attack was most likely carried out by a pro-al Qaeda group. Obama has vowed ""justice will be done."" U.S. warships, carrying guided missiles, are on their way to the coast of Libya, and unmanned drones are being sent to help search for the killers. And a group of Marines called a Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team has been deployed to Libya to help secure U.S. facilities, two U.S. officials said. About 50 Marines arrived in the country Wednesday, officials said. Libyan Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur said he is heading a high-level commission that includes heads of the North African nation's foreign, defense and interior ministries to investigate the attack. ""Our friends ... have supported us throughout these difficult times,"" he said about the U.S. government. ""We are very determined to bring things back to order."" Romney, Obama navigate Arab world turmoil . Abushagur said at least one Libyan was arrested Thursday morning in connection to the attack, with authorities actively pursuing ""three or four"" more after examining video from the scene and talking with witnesses. The prime minister offered details on the case Thursday shortly after Libyan Deputy Interior Minister Wanis al-Sharif said ""some individuals"" suspected in the case were in custody, according to state-run LANA news agency.

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- When exactly did the donkey become an endangered species? Democrats had big victories in recent years, taking back control of both houses of Congress in 2006 and the White House in 2008. And, in response to those defeats, Republicans seemed to be wandering in the wilderness. Unsure of whom to be, GOP strategists have been wasting time locked in a completely unconstructive debate over whether to do more outreach or get back to the basics of conservatism. (It's not as if you can't do both those things.) Today, Republicans are still lost in the woods. But suddenly, things look even bleaker for Democrats, who seem as if they're headed off in a dozen different directions. Polls show a detectable amount of angst among many Americans over the cost of health care reform, government bailouts and other massive expenditures. There is a sense in many parts of the country that President Obama and Congressional Democrats are trying to do too much too fast and running up too high a bill in the process. Worse, there is growing anxiety that -- in trying to do so much at once -- the administration and Democrats in Congress have taken their eyes off more important matters. Like keeping the country safe. The recent terror scare orchestrated by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, the 23-year-old Nigerian suspected suicide bomber who allegedly intended to blow up a U.S. airliner on Christmas Day, has only heightened those concerns. And frankly, Obama's comments Thursday about the incident and the changes that his administration is preparing to make to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again won't do much to reassure the country. The remarks were underwhelming and predictable. While Obama was right to take responsibility and insist that the buck stops with him, he should have explained exactly why the dots weren't connected by the intelligence community and been more willing to assign blame. That might have convinced more Americans that Obama and everyone who works for him understand that, in this deadly game of counterterrorism, you have to catch every possible threat. We got lucky this time. But luck runs out. Americans need to see that their leaders understand this simple fact. Maybe the Congressional hearings into the incident will accomplish that. The GOP may not be in the best shape, and it can still be its own worst enemy. And yet, Republicans look pretty good compared to Democrats, whose moves have been even more questionable. It's no wonder that some Democratic lawmakers are bailing out. Two longtime Democratic senators have announced their retirements and according to polls, a handful of others are trailing against Republican opponents . This week, Democratic Sens. Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota dropped out of re-election bids. Both are longtime senators with powerful committee chairmanships, so why would Dodd and Dorgan throw in the towel? And why would recent polls show the Democratic candidate for the Senate running behind the Republican in at least seven states -- Connecticut, Nevada, Ohio, Arkansas, Pennsylvania, North Dakota and Colorado? And why would some prominent Republicans be newly energized to run for top offices -- such as former Rep. John R. Kasich challenging Democratic incumbent Gov. Ted Strickland in Ohio. The liberal media is helpfully putting forth its own explanations for the Democrats' doldrums. Dodd and Dorgan were facing tough re-election battles, we are told. Dodd had been struggling with personal challenges, including his bout with prostate cancer and the death of his best friend in the Senate, Ted Kennedy, who died last year. According to the Los Angeles Times, the economic climate might have been a factor and Dodd could be another casualty of the recession. That's a rather benign explanation -- and an unsatisfying one. It's closer to the truth to suggest that a key factor in all this -- the Dodd and Dorgan retirements, the growing unpopularity of Democratic Senate candidates, the new energy among Republicans -- is the health care debate. It is true that Democrats are polling badly in states where Congress' health care reform remedies are unpopular. But even that doesn't tell the whole story. For that, you need to look at a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll from last month that found that Republicans had closed the popularity gap with Democrats. In that survey, 40 percent of those questioned say the United States would be better off if Democrats ran Congress while 39 percent feel things would be better if Republicans ran Congress. The one-point margin was a statistical tie. Just a few months earlier, in August, Democrats had enjoyed a 10-point advantage over Republicans. In January, about the time that President Obama took office, Democrats had a 25-point advantage. For now, the American people seem to be saying, loud and clear: Slow down. Think about what you're doing. Pay your way. Don't simply borrow and print money. And, above all, choose your priorities carefully. Don't forget what's really important. That message will get through, sooner or later -- even if, when it does, not all of today's members of Congress are around to hear it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Two Democratic senators dropped their bids for re-election this week .
Ruben Navarrette says suddenly the Democrats look more lost than the Republicans .
He says the nation is worried that White House, Congress are trying to do too much .

"(CNN)The elusive artist Banksy is known for producing powerful imagery, so it makes sense that more than 100,000 people would share his Instagrammed tribute to those killed in Paris on Wednesday. Except the artist says it's not his. After 12 people were killed Wednesday during a lunchtime attack on the offices of a Paris-based satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, an illustration was posted on the Instagram account @Banksy, which has about a million followers. The drawing shows a sharpened pencil with the word ""yesterday"" written above it, followed by a broken pencil with the word ""today"" and a final image marked ""tomorrow,"" with the broken portion of the pencil sharped to create two pencils. However, a representative for Banksy has denied to The Independent newspaper that the image is his creation, as has been claimed. The caption on the Instagram says ""RIP."" A tag was later added for French illustrator Lucille Clerc, who is based in London. ""We can confirm this is not by Banksy,"" the representative said. Clerc tweeted her tribute to the dead, among whom were several respected political cartoonists, with the caption ""Break one, thousand will rise #CharlieHebdo #JeSuisCharlie #raiseyourpencilforfreedom."" It's just one of many tributes that have appeared on social media as the world reacted in the wake of the shootings.","The image has been shared by more than 100,000 .

"Gunmen on Friday shot dead a Nigerian Islamic traditional leader in the northeastern state of Borno as he and other Muslim royals were heading to a funeral, the state government said. Idrissa Timta, emir of the town of Gwoza, was killed as he and two other emirs were traveling to the funeral of an emir in neighboring Gombe state, Borno government representative Bab Ahmed Jidda said. Jidda said the attackers are suspected to be members of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram. The country's defense ministry, which also reported the attack, called the gunmen a ""band of terrorists"" but did not identify their affiliation. The emir of Uba, Ali Ibn Ismaila Mamza, and the emir of Askira, Abdullahi Ibn Muhammadu Askirama, escaped unhurt, according to Jidda. The gunmen specifically targeted the vehicle holding the three emirs and opened fire, Jidda said. A police escort was shot and injured in the attack, Jidda said. Wali Ibrahim, a member of the Gwoza royalty and a close aide to the slain emir, said the gunmen opened fire from hilltops overlooking the highway. ""We came under heavy gunfire from the hills, which forced the convoy to break up in disarray,"" said Ibrahim, who was in Timta's entourage. ""We returned to a military checkpoint not far from the scene of the attack and reported the incident to soldiers there, but to our surprise they made no effort to go after the attackers,"" Ibrahim said. ""By the time we returned to the scene, we met the emir dead inside the vehicle with gunshots,"" he said. Troops were dispatched to the area after the attack and are trying to find the assailants, the defense ministry said. Boko Haram has repeatedly targeted Nigeria's Islamic emirs, accusing them of selling out by submitting to the authority of the secular government. The emirs are from traditional royal families and often serve as liaisons between their communities and the secular government. Timta's late father had been a chief in Gwoza. In July 2012, Nigeria's third-most powerful emir, the shehu of Borno, Umar Garbai El-Kanemi, survived a suicide bombing as he left a mosque near his palace. The traditional leader survived the attack, but five other people were killed. In August 2012, a suicide bomber tried to kill the emir of Fika in northeastern Yobe state as he left Friday prayers near his palace in the town of Potiskum. That emir survived the blast, though his police guard was killed. Last year, Nigeria's No. 2 Islamic leader, Abo Bayero, the emir of Kano, survived an attack on his convoy.  Five people, including three of his bodyguards, died. There have been calls from activists for Nigeria's emirs to play a greater role in curbing Boko Haram, which has waged a campaign of violence -- especially in northeastern Nigeria -- with the aim of imposing a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria. Boko Haram, which means ""western education is a sin,"" still is holding more than 200 girls it abducted last month from a school in Chibok, also in Borno state. Boko Haram kills 33 security personnel in Nigeria attacks .","Emir of Gwoza, other leaders were heading to funeral of another emir .

"In parental torment over what became of his son and 42 other missing Mexican students, Isrrael Galindo rejects official accounts they apparently were massacred. He hopes that somehow his son and the others are still alive. ""I think they have him arrested or locked up. I don't know where he is, but if I knew, I would go get him,"" Galindo said of Israel, 19, his namesake son with a different spelling. ""I want him to know that I love him,"" he added, beginning to weep. ""I want him alive."" Anguish overwhelms Galindo and grows daily, ever since the aspiring primary school teachers disappeared September 26 in a violent clash with police during a political protest that also left six people dead, including three other students. The mass disappearance is so haunting that Galindo can't believe it befell his son. The father hasn't seen Israel in eight years, since migrating to California to find work and send money to his wife and their four sons back in Mexico, but the memory of him burns vividly. The 43 missing students went missing after they had been captured by police in the city of Iguala, in Guerrero state. They allegedly were turned over to a gang in cartel territory and then executed in a dumpster in Cocula, 14 miles away. The gang burned the bodies and dumped them in a river, authorities say. Fighting a ""monster"" Like many other parents and their supporters, Galindo excoriates Mexican officials in the same breath that he asserts his son is alive. ""I don't lose faith, but we have fought and fought this monster in front of us, and we can't get ahead,"" said Galindo, 66, a handyman who lives in San Jose and is believed to be the only U.S.-based parent of any of the 43 students. The ""monster"" is the Mexican government, Galindo says. He doesn't believe what authorities say about the students having been tortured and killed. The story is a way for Mexican authorities to push the case aside and move on, he says. The 43 students were mostly men in their 20s from a college outside Iguala devoted to helping poor, rural schools. So far, authorities have charged Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca as the ""probable mastermind"" in the 43 students' disappearance, and he has been charged with six counts of aggravated homicide and one count of attempted homicide, authorities said. In all, at least 74 people have been arrested in connection with the disappearances and the deaths, and the governor of Guerrero has taken a leave of absence amid scorching criticism that he responded too slowly to what's been called one of the most serious human rights abuses in recent Latin American history. Galindo isn't satisfied with those arrests. ""I can't tell you that our government isn't doing anything. They say one thing and then promise another. They say they are going to do something, and they deviate and they don't do anything,"" Galindo said. Uproar at highest places . The inability of authorities to locate the 43 students or their bodies is an open wound on the psyche of the 43 families and Mexican society. The case is being compared by human rights activists to Mexico City's Tlatelolco Square massacre on the eve of the 1968 Olympics there, in which police are alleged to have killed as many as 300 student demonstrators calling for greater democracy in what was then a one-party system. The current public uproar has touched the highest political and religious institutions in Mexico. At the holiest of shrines devoted to Mexico's patron saint, some parents prayed to the Virgin at the Basilica of Guadalupe in Mexico City, chanting ""alive they were taken, alive we want them returned."" ""We have come here so that the Virgin will give us a miracle, to give us a hand, so that my son and the others will appear,"" Clemente Rodriguez Moreno, father of missing Christian, told AFP at the Basilica in October. Then, demonstrators spray-painted and tried to burn a door to the Palacio Nacional, or National Palace, in Mexico City's central square in unsuccessful effort to breach it. On November 20, a national caravan of protesters will converge on Mexico City, led by some of the families of the missing 43 people and other students from la Escuela Normal Rural de Ayotzinapa, a small college devoted to training students to become teachers. Parents' demands . The parents even met with President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto in his Los Pinos residence about the police search for the missing 43 people and declared the government's results insufficient. ""As parents, as students, as lawyers, we believe that these commitments are not enough,"" said Meliton Ortega, father of missing Mauricio. ""There are no results for us. The results for us will be significant the moment that they hand over all of our missing children."" The parents want a team of Argentina specialists to review the investigation, and they want the Mexican President to sign an agreement with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to participate in the probe, according to the parents' attorney, Vidulfo Rosales. ""Today there is no irrefutable proof, there remains lines of investigations, there are several people who need to be arrested, there are several statements that could change the course of the investigation,"" Rosales said. ""Parents are not going to accept the hypothesis before us. It is not a conclusive, final investigation. The investigation needs to be open, so that there will be the full truth that the parents are fighting for. We make several petitions that we find this truth,"" Rosales said. Other missing people cases . The alleged massacre of the 43 students has now prompted other families to renew attention on long unsolved cases of missing relatives and migrants in Mexico. Mexico's Interior Ministry counts 22,322 missing people since 2006, excluding the 43 students. The country's National Institute of Migration says 3,000 migrants from Central America have also gone missing in Mexico since 2010. Mercedes Moreno has been wondering for 23 years what became of her son when he traveled from his native El Salvador to Mexico in attempt to reach the United States. ""Twenty-three years that I haven't been to give him a hug on his birthday, 23 years that I haven't been able to my son Merry Christmas,"" Moreno said of her son, Jose, who would now be age 47. She criticized the Mexican government for failing to solve the case. She gave a DNA sample of her son to authorities a decade ago. ""It doesn't matter what country we're in, what nationality we are, pain is pain,"" said Moreno, a retiree who lives in an Los Angeles apartment filled with photos of her missing son. Backlash against teachers' college . In San Jose, Galindo resides in a modest house owned by his wife's family in the working class Tropicana neighborhood. An extended family lives in the one-story residence, with cousins and a grandmother. Galindo's last contact with his son was a phone call just eight days before he and other students traveled in buses to Iguala to protest a speech by the mayor's wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda, who along with her husband are known as ""the imperial couple."" A history of antagonism exists between Iguala's elite and the students of Ayotzinapa, who were involved in a violent protest last year. The students are portrayed by Iguala's business and political leaders as rabble-rousers, one Mexican analyst said. ""The young students who are studying to be teachers of farmers have been stigmatized. They have been presented as vandals, people who cause problems,"" Luis Hernandez Navarro, editor of La Jornada, one of Mexico's major newspapers, told CNN en Espanol. The rural teachers' colleges, sometimes called normal schools, are called  ""devil schools"" by critics, Hernandez said. ""These are schools that are poor, and for the poor, to teach the poor,"" Hernandez said. The schools have been in the government's cross hairs, and business groups have requested they be closed, he added. ""These schools are the gateway to move socially for the poor, rural students,"" Hernandez said, ""and they are one of the few escape routes that farmers have for their children to become teachers and prosper."" A father's pride . Whatever antipathy existed against the students, nothing could excuse this, Hernandez said. ""They did this because they knew they could,"" Hernandez said, ""and they don't think there will be consequences."" But Galindo is proud that all four of his sons attended the teachers college, located in Tixtla, about 77 miles south of Iguala. ""Two of them are already teachers, and they graduated from Ayotzinapa. My other son was in his second year in Ayotzinapa,"" Galindo said. He said he wants more than justice for his son. ""I need to see him.""","Isrrael Galindo is believed to be the only U.S.-based parent of any of the 43 missing students .
He hopes his 19-year-old son and the 42 other students are still alive .
""I want him to know that I love him,"" he weeps, ""I want him alive""
Other parents and many in Mexico are in an uproar over an apparent atrocity ."
"It's well known that the decision to impose collective guilt on Germany at the end of the First World War was a fateful one.  But even today, 100 years after the start of the Great War, the fallout from the Treaty of Versailles affects U.S. foreign policy --from Europe to the Middle East, from Ukraine to Syria. At the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, the signing of the Treaty of Versailles ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers.  Article 231 of the treaty, the notorious War Guilt clause, required ""Germany (to) accept the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage"" during the war. The treaty forced Germany to disarm, make substantial territorial concessions and pay reparations to certain countries.  The total cost was 132 billion marks, or $31.4 billion, roughly equivalent to $442 billion today. At the time, economists, notably John Maynard Keynes, warned that the victors were imposing a brutal ""Carthaginian peace,"" a reference to the peace imposed on Carthage by Rome 2,000 years before, which amounted to a complete crushing of the enemy and which also mandated the payment of constant tribute. Opinion: How a century-old war affects you . Germans' feelings of victimization and hatred of Versailles were soon exploited by Adolf Hitler. Many analysts now conclude that this miscarriage of justice, this experience of collective punishment, backfired and helped pave the road to World War II. The discrediting of the collective guilt imposed at Versailles would result in a major reorientation in international law and policy, changes that we live with today.  Guilty nations have been replaced by war criminals, prosecuted and punished by international tribunals. After World War II, the Nuremberg trials for ""crimes against the peace"" were justified not in retrospective terms but in forward-looking ones--namely the peace of future generations.  The postwar trials reflect that even individual responsibility is understood today less in terms of retribution than deterrence. Opinion: When chemical weapons killed 90,000 . This new view of responsibility has become more and more pronounced in recent years, to the point where individuals may be held responsible, but nations are absolved. In 1995, at the first public indictment proceeding of the architects of the Balkans ethnic cleansing policy,  Chief Prosecutor Richard Goldstone declared that the proceeding of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia would establish a ""public record"" to ""assist in attributing guilt to individuals ...and in avoiding the attribution of collective guilt to any nation or ethnic group."" Opinion: The mighty women of World War I . In the words of the prosecutor in the very first case in the court against a member of the Serbian paramilitary force, Dusko Tadic, accused of horrendous persecution of Muslims in the Omarska detention camp, ""Absolving nations of collective guilt through the attribution of individual responsibility is an essential means of countering the misinformation and indoctrination which breeds ethnic and religious hatred."" (Tadic was convicted of, among other things, crimes against humanity.) Such international justice via individual accountability would break ""old cycles of ethnic retribution"" and thus by displacing vengeance would advance reconciliation. The court was considered to be critical to restoring the peace in the region. Opinion: How World War I gave us 'cooties' This emphasis on individual responsibility was crowned with the establishment of the permanent International Criminal Court in 2000.  Deterrence is the clear goal in the ICC preamble. It declares that ""during this century millions of children, women and men have been victims of unimaginable atrocities that deeply shock the conscience of humanity,"" and expresses the Court's determination to ""put an end to impunity for the perpetrators of these crimes and thus to contribute to the prevention of such crimes."" The United Nations also shifted away from collective punishment toward smart sanctions that target individuals with economic and other punitive measures, ordered by the U.N. Security Council, and not entire countries.  Indeed, one can see how this shift affects policy today toward Russia over its meddling in Ukraine and toward Syria, where in both instances international response has taken the form of international sanctions as well as international criminal justice, both responses eschewing collective punishment. Opinion: The 'bionic men' of World War I . In Syria, for example: This May the French sponsored a resolution to Security Council members that would have given the ICC jurisdiction over crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in Syria during its ongoing civil war. The United States was among the many Security Council members to support the referral, but the action would ultimately be blocked by China and Russia in a Security Council vote earlier this summer. Likewise, the Russian incursion into Crimea might in the past have raised Cold War tensions and provoked a collective punishment on the entire nation, but the response of the United States and the European Union illustrates the approach of individualizing responsibility: While the sanctions have been progressively expanded and tightened in response to ongoing events (the latest being the downing of the Malaysia Airlilnes jet over Ukraine), the companies and individuals targeted have been clearly selected on the basis of their proximity-- those who may be making or supporting the specific decisions relating to Ukraine. Still, such sanctions can only work if the international community hangs together, and the temptation for the world's major military powers to revert to the rhetoric of retribution can be almost overwhelmingÃ¢â¬âone might say even that the Obama administration fell victim to it late last year calling for accountability and an end to impunity for the Bashar al-Assad regime as a basis for U.S. military intervention. But the anniversary of the Great War and its Armistice can serve as a reminder that retribution against a people or society breeds a sense of injustice and indeed may be intrinsically unfair. Rather than a just settlement to war, it may serve only to perpetuate conflict.

"John King and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each Sunday to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days, weeks and months ahead. One final 2014 showdown and several examples of post-election fallout filled a trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table that -- surprise -- included one note of possible bipartisan compromise. 1. The battle of the bayou appears one-sided . The December 6 Louisiana Senate runoff is the last 2014 showdown and, at least so far, it appears to be a lopsided affair. GOP Rep. Bill Cassidy leads in the polls, and even most Democrats assign little or no hope to their incumbent, Sen. Mary Landrieu. The Atlantic's Molly Ball noted how both candidates are using the ""lame-duck"" Congress to highlight their support for the Keystone XL pipeline. And she noted some details -- ""facts on the ground"" a good military analyst might say -- that suggest Cassidy has a huge advantage. ""The tea party candidate who came in third endorsed Cassidy, (Landrieu is) thought to be down by double digits and 90% of the advertising on the Louisiana air waves is in favor of Cassidy,"" said Ball. ""So unless we see a big change in the dynamic in the Louisiana race as a result of the Keystone vote, Mary Landrieu has a real tough fight."" 2. Leader Pelosi tries to help a friend, and irks some colleagues . Many long-serving House Democrats are lamenting at least two more years in the minority -- which means a lot less power and fewer perks. So being a ""ranking member"" -- the top Democrat -- on a committee is, for the moment, the top prize available. Normally, seniority and past committee service are the criteria for these titles, but sometimes there are competitions, and in that case who you know can matter. Ed O'Keefe of The Washington Post took us inside one such battle, in which Nancy Pelosi has a starring role. ""There's sort of a proxy battle for the top Democratic job on the House Energy and Commerce Committee,"" said O'Keefe. ""It pits New Jersey Democrat Frank Pallone, who has seniority, against California Democrat Anna Eshoo, who's a very good friend of Pelosi. She's been actively campaigning for Eshoo, twisting some arms, refusing to allow people to vote by proxy from a distance if they're unable to be here, generating a lot of bad blood and a few different rank-and-file members said this is just a little too high school for them."" 3. Wait, there might actually be some Obama dealmaking? Peter Baker of The New York Times shared reporting that President Obama is prepared to make a deal, so that he wins Senate confirmation for a number of administration appointees. The goal: votes to get ambassadors and other appointees on the job, eliminating vacancies the White House says have undermined government performance. The price: Baker reports that to get enough senators in both parties to sign off on the package, the President is prepared to withdraw several controversial nominees. ""President Obama has a lot of nominations still sitting there, languishing on the Hill,"" said Baker. ""He's working with Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell to get a package deal through, pushing a bunch through, mostly career ambassadors, and tossing over to the side some of the more controversial ones, like nominee for surgeon general and that guy who wants to be ambassador to Norway, which is never busy."" 4. Talk of undusting Obama's veto pen . A good deal of post-election analysis has raised the prospect of President Obama wielding his veto power more now that Republicans control both chambers of Congress. But will that happen? Will the GOP, for example, be able to get enough votes in the Senate to join the House in voting to repeal Obamacare? Or to pass anything big for that matter? NPR's Tamara Keith suggested there might be a lot more talk about vetoes than actual use of the veto pen. ""He's only used it twice in his entire presidency,"" said Keith. ""The first big test is coming up this week with the Keystone XL pipeline vote. The word is there are 59 votes and some optimism that maybe they'll get to 60 but maybe not. My question is how soon will he really have to use that veto pen and how frequently, given the close balance in the Senate."" 5. In New Hampshire, a big GOP win sparks a Republican fight . New Hampshire Republicans lost races for governor and U.S. Senate this midterm year, but are celebrating their success in retaking control of the state House chamber. Well, celebrating and fighting at the same time. A former GOP speaker, Bill O'Brien, wants his old job back. But an array of Republican establishment figures are pushing an alternative candidate, arguing O'Brien is too conservative and, in their view, likely to hurt the GOP's image by pushing policies backed by the tea party and social conservatives. Among those trying to block O'Brien: former Gov. John Sununu, former state GOP Chairman Steve Merrill and Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte. The buzz in Concord is about how rare it is for a U.S. senator to meddle in state legislative business. But those close to Ayotte say she and the others involved see this as a tea party vs. establishment battle they must fight. Ayotte is up for re-election in 2016, a presidential year in which the electorate tends to be more favorable to Democrats. So Ayotte does not want two years of home state political debate about whether the New Hampshire GOP is too extreme. Especially because the new House speaker would be regularly engaged in debates with Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan -- who just won re-election and is the early choice of many state Democrats as their best Ayotte challenger.","90% of advertising in the Louisiana Senate race is in favor of Cassidy .

"(CNN) -- Solange Knowles has always been independent. Just ask her big sister, Beyonce, who told the New York Times back in 2012, ""My sister will not record with me. She's her own woman."" After years of carving her own niche in fashion and music, Knowles, 28, has once again stepped out of the limelight around her more famous sibling: Her wedding over the weekend set the Internet a-Twitter. The singer married longtime love, music video director Alan Ferguson, 51, on Sunday in her adopted city of New Orleans. And by it being the big day for the woman who has blogged about her fashion for the likes of Vogue, it wasn't your average celebrity nuptials. Here are five ways Knowles broke wedding traditions with style. Everyone wore white . Why should the bride have all the fun? Everyone wore white or some variation and it was a really good look. All white wedding themes are gathering steam these days -- just check out Pinterest. Friend and Destiny's Child member Kelly Rowland stuck to a similar theme at her recent ceremony, when her wedding party donned all white. Who says it's bad luck to see the groom before the ceremony? Not only did Solange see Ferguson, who has directed videos for artists including his new sister-in-law and Katy Perry, but the pair rode vintage, white bikes on the streets of the French Quarter to get to their wedding ceremony which was held at the Marigny Opera House. It was pretty adorable. She wore a wedding pantsuit . The bride arrived for her wedding sporting a low-cut, cream-colored jumpsuit with a cape by designer Stephane Rolland. Her wedding portrait shows her in an elegant and high-necked Humberto Leon for Kenzo gown with a floor-length cape. It was classy and modest. What bridesmaids dresses? If her wedding pic is any indication, everyone wore what they wanted. Instead of a traditional wedding party shot, Knowles commissioned an all-female portrait which shows women -- including sister Beyonce, mother Tina Knowles and singer friend Janelle Monae -- all wearing various designs in white. She's a celebrity who didn't have a celebrity wedding . Sure, major celebrities were there. Beyonce and Jay Z alone are major star power. But Knowles kept it simple and fun for the event, which was attended by about 200 guests. According to People, the couple had an intimate pre-wedding party at the Indywood Cinema and their wedding was followed by a traditional second line on the streets of New Orleans. It was a second marriage for Knowles, who was earlier married to former college football player Daniel Smith, who is father of their son Daniel Julez, 10. ""Everyone I worked with on the wedding are friends who I love,"" Knowles told Vogue. ""Everything was a labor of love.""","Solange Knowles married in New Orleans on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- The goal of Common Core is laudable: Give all students a common experience in English and math. But the path to that end has been fraught with problems. For one thing, more parents and educators are upset over all the tests students now have to take. Teachers are concerned about the negative impact of teaching to the test. Supporters of Common Core insist the standards and tests are necessary for holding schools accountable and ensuring a better future for America. But they may want to take a page from China, which has experienced the good, bad and ugly of a testing culture. For over a thousand years, Chinese emperors used the imperial exam system keju to select government officials. When the great empire was shattered by Western powers in the 19th century, keju was blamed for China's failure to cultivate the creative and diverse talents needed for modernization. It was officially ended in 1905. But the keju spirit lives on today in the body of the college entrance exam, or gaokao. Because it is practically the only way for upward social mobility, gaokao wields as much power as keju. It orients all aspects of education at all levels toward preparing for the exam. As a result, the modern day education system in China remains a test-prep machine as it was in the days of keju. China has certainly benefited from high-stakes testing and a focused common curriculum. The imperial exam system did a perfect job in cultivating obedient and homogeneous intellectuals, who contributed to China's continuous pre-eminence as an agricultural empire. The modern-day test-prep education has produced the best test-takers in the world. Students from Shanghai have twice ranked No. 1 on the Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA, earning China the reputation of having one of the best education systems in the world. Why Finland's schools are top-notch . The Chinese system has also produced many extremely hardworking, highly motivated and excellent professionals. It's true that the very best ones are sought after by Fortune 500 companies. But they are a tiny fraction. One study shows that fewer than 10% of Chinese graduates would be qualified to work in a foreign company in occupations such as engineering, finance and accounting. The truth is that the testing culture of China has taken a big toll. Corruption such as bribery, cheating and other forms of fraud intended to boost test results has been rampant in the past as well as today. Stress, anxiety, poor physical health and a lack of social and practical life skills are well-known characteristics of Chinese students. The biggest price China has paid is the loss of creative talents. Its education system stifles creativity, suppresses individuality and induces conformity by forcing all children to compete for better test outcomes in a narrow set of subjects. Testing rewards those who are willing and able to give the right answers in the right way as demanded by the authority, while eliminating those who are unwilling or unable, but who may be talented in other areas. It thus fosters the spirit of compliance. It also results in impoverished educational experiences by forcing schools and teachers to teach to the test. Parents, too, are forced to narrow their children's education experience to improve their children's test performance. Children are thus deprived of the opportunities to explore their interests and find their passion. China has become keenly aware of the damages of its test-oriented education. Over the past few decades, China has launched multiple rounds of reforms to reduce the importance of testing. Last year, for example, the Ministry of Education issued the order to ban testing for grades one through three. For grades four and up, standardized testing is only allowed once per term for three subjects (Chinese, math and foreign language). Tests cannot be used to admit students during the compulsory education stage. There is no reason to believe America can be immune to the corruptive power of high stakes testing China has suffered. The increase in standardized testing that resulted from No Child Left Behind has already led to an increase in the number of cheating scandals in schools across the country, narrowing of curricula, and stress on teachers and children. Thanks to China's outstanding PISA performance, America has been encouraged to learn from China. But the Chinese lesson that matters most is not what it did to do well on international tests. Rather, it is the country's recent reform efforts to de-emphasize testing. China wants to have the same kind of creative and entrepreneurial talents America desires for the future. It is doing so by minimizing testing, because it has learned that testing and standardization do not help with, and more likely hurt, the development of creative and entrepreneurial talents. This is the Chinese lesson that America can learn.","Yong Zhao: Common Core's advocacy of more tests for students is not a great idea .

"The federal government should pay back New York and other cities that have shelled out millions to deal with Ebola, U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer said Sunday. In New York, which diagnosed its first Ebola case last month, the price tag has been steep, Schumer said. The city has spent about $20 million so far to quarantine and treat Dr. Craig Spencer, trace his contacts and make sure the disease doesn't spread, according to Schumer, a Democrat. Spencer was released from Bellevue Hospital Center last week after weeks of treatment. Word that Spencer went for a jog, traveled the city's vast subway system and went bowling before his diagnosis sparked fears that the number of Ebola cases could grow in the city, though authorities stressed that the risk of him spreading the virus was low. ""The world-class effort mounted by the city and Bellevue to fight Ebola was not cost-free -- far from it,"" Schumer told reporters Sunday. Spencer's treatment was ""extremely expensive,"" Schumer said, involving about 100 workers. City health officials also ramped up operations to keep track of people returning from Ebola hotspots in West Africa and those who had direct contact with Spencer, Schumer said. ""Simply put, local communities, local taxpayers should not foot the whole bill for handling this infectious disease that may have been physically present in New York City, but was truly a threat to the whole nation,"" he said. Last month, officials in Dallas County, Texas, told The Dallas Morning News they'd already spent more than $1 million responding to the Ebola crisis. County leaders there have also said they plan to request reimbursement, the newspaper reported. The Obama administration said earlier this month that it wants Congress to foot the bill for more than $6 billion in ""emergency funding"" to fight Ebola. That includes $4.5 billion for immediate response and $1.5 billion for a contingency fund, an Office of Management and Budget official told CNN. Schumer said Sunday that money should include a special ""Ebola Contingency Fund"" that would reimburse states and local governments for treatment and containment of Ebola. Obama's existing appropriations request, Schumer's office said, ""does not include any plan to reimburse localities like New York City in such a substantial way."" Last month, the World Bank estimated that the cost of Ebola could top $32 billion over the next two years if the deadly virus spreads to more countries in West Africa.","Sen. Chuck Schumer says New York should be reimbursed for money spent on Ebola .

"(CNN)Beyonce: What are you trying to tell us? That's what the Internet is agonizing over after she posted a photo on Instagram of herself on Sunday. The caption-less picture shows the ""Flawless"" pop diva on the beach, buried in sand. The pronounced piles of sand on her stomach and breasts led some of her Instagram followers to speculate that she was dropping pregnancy hints. Either that, or Blue Ivy needs to work on her sandcastles. The move is classic Beyonce, who has a history of game-ifying the message when it comes to personal announcements. She revealed her first pregnancy at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards by stripping off her blazer at the end of her performance to show off her baby bump. Since then, the Internet and entertainment media has been obsessed with searching for clues to her next pregnancy. Gawker published a lengthy post in December citing evidence that Beyonce has been pregnant for months. Bottom line: We'll know for sure when Beyonce is ready for us to know.","Beyonce Instagrams picture of herself on beach covered in sand .

"It took 17 years for the approval of plans to relocate a controversial U.S. military base in Japan, and now it appears those plans won't happen after all. On Sunday, Takeshi Onaga won Okinawa's gubernatorial race. He defeated the two-term incumbent who, in 2013, approved the move of the base, according to the Kyodo News agency. Onaga's victory delivers ""a de-facto no vote"" to the relocation, Kyodo reported. Onaga wants the base closed rather than moved, The Washington Post reported. When Gov. Hirokazu Nakaima finally approved a landfill measure in December of last year, he ended a 17-year stalemate on plans to transfer the base from a densely populated area to a more sparsely populated one. When Nakaima approved that measure, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel issued a written statement that called the decision ""absolutely critical to the United States' ongoing rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region and our ability to maintain a geographically distributed, operationally resilient, and politically sustainable force posture in the region."" The U.S. Marine Corps Futenma Air Station in Okinawa was built in 1945, following the battle of Okinawa in World War II, according to the Marine Corps' website. In recent years the base has been unpopular with the island's residents because of allegations against, and crimes committed by, U.S. military personnel. Many residents were incensed by the rape of a 12-year-old Japanese girl in 1995 by three U.S. military personnel. It sparked some of the worst anti-U.S. military demonstrations seen in Japan in decades. In 2002, a U.S. staff sergeant in the Air Force was convicted of raping a Japanese woman in a parking lot outside a popular nightclub in Okinawa. Intense media coverage of the case brought pressure on the Japanese government to review its agreement with the United States about handling criminal cases in Japan involving the U.S. military. And allegations that a Marine raped a 14-year-old girl caused a furor in 2008. The girl later decided not to pursue charges. In 2012, three U.S. servicemen were arrested in connection with rapes in Okinawa. About half of all U.S. military personnel in Japan are stationed on the island. According to Kyodo, the base relocation was a major issue in this gubernatorial election. ""We proved that the people of Okinawa disagree (with Nakaima),"" Onaga told reporters, describing the outcome as opening ""a new page in history,"" Kyodo reported.","Takeshi Onaga defeats two-term incumbent in Okinawa's gubernatorial race .

"A man who pleaded guilty to sex crimes against children and was featured on CNN's ""The Hunt"" is dead, U.S. Marshals in Texas said Monday. Law enforcement credited the media for keeping the case out front -- and an Austin Labrador retriever who found the convict's skull in a field and brought it back home. The dog brought the skull back home in September and its owner contacted authorities, who have worked since then to determine if the remains were that of fugitive Kevin Patrick Stoeser. DNA tests recently confirmed that. ""We owe her a box of dog bones,"" U.S. Marshal Robert R. Almonte said, gesturing toward the dog and his owner, who were at the press conference. See more on Stoeser from ""The Hunt"" Stoeser, a U.S. soldier who was dishonorably discharged, pleaded guilty in 2003 to child sexual assault and child pornography charges and was sentenced to 13 years behind bars. While he was on supervised probation at a halfway house in 2011, Stoeser was returned to prison after engaging in electronic communications with underage girls. In August 2013, Stoeser was transferred to the Austin Transitional Center, a halfway house in Texas. Two months later, staff members allegedly caught Stoeser using a smart phone which had images of underage children, authorities said Monday. When confronted, Stoeser ran through an emergency door at the facility. Stoeser was on the U.S. Marshals top 15 most wanted list. Authorities said Monday it's unclear when he died, or how. No other remains have been found, they said. Remains of another suspect featured on the ""The Hunt"" were also found earlier this year, and another suspect who was profiled on the show was killed in a gunbattle with authorities. In August, the remains of Shane Miller were found in California. Miller was the prime suspect in the deaths of his wife and two young daughters. In July, a phone call to authorities came during an airing of ""The Hunt"" which led them to Charles Mozdir, a suspected sex offender. He died in a shootout in New York City as police closed in on him.","DNA confirms that a skull that a dog found in Texas belongs to Kevin Patrick Stoeser .

"A fire at a food packaging plant in eastern China has killed at least 18 people, state-run media reported Monday. The blaze hit a carrot packaging facility late Sunday in Shouguang City, Shandong province, China's state news agency Xinhua reported, citing local authorities. Thirteen people injured in the fire are being treated in the hospital, the news agency said. The plant belongs to Longyuan Food Co., according to Xinhua. Company managers ""have been put under police control,"" it said, without giving further details. The cause of the blaze, which began around 7 p.m. and was extinguished by around 9:30 p.m., is still being investigated.

"Australian morning show anchor Karl Stefanovic wore the same suit every day for a year, minus a dry cleaning here and there. Nobody noticed. His co-anchor, Lisa Wilkinson, wears something different every day -- and viewers regularly let her have it. (One correspondent demanded she ""get some style"" and called one outfit ""jarring and awful."") A double standard? Of course. Stefanovic was trying to make a point about sexism, he told Australia's Fairfax Media. ""I'm judged on my interviews, my appalling sense of humor -- on how I do my job, basically. Whereas women are quite often judged on what they're wearing or how their hair is,"" he said. It's certainly nothing new. There are hundreds of ""worst-dressed women"" galleries after awards shows, but almost nobody publishes a ""worst-dressed"" gallery of actors; few keep track of Brad Pitt's hairstyles as assiduously as they do those of his former wife, Jennifer Aniston. And often, as Stefanovic pointed out on Monday's show, it's women criticizing other women. Indeed, there's a whole industry of gossip and fashion magazines targeted at women that exist to showcase women's clothing and ""hot new looks,"" while in magazines aimed at men -- such as GQ and Esquire -- fashion and style are simply portions of a much larger scope of issues. It's ""ridiculous,"" agrees New York-based style consultant Rachel Weingarten -- but nevertheless, she adds, there's something to be said for being noticed. ""Is it deep down a good thing? Yes,"" she says. ""From a business perspective, it's excellent that viewers feel connected enough or engaged enough that they can write to their local newscaster and say, 'Hey, you look kinda crummy today.' If you're being talked about, great. It means people care about your appearance."" Moreover, she adds, men are aware of image as well, even if it's usually under the radar. (There are exceptions: both Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama were criticized for their choice of suits, and Weingarten says that her mother once accosted the notoriously sloppy New York mayor Ed Koch and told him to clean up.) ""I've noticed that with my (male) executive clients and CEOs, they're more interested in products for their face -- eye creams and whitening their teeth,"" she says. ""So you may not notice it to the naked eye, but the bottom line is there's a lot below the surface we should look into."" Besides, women have more options: a male broadcaster such as Stefanovic is pretty much locked into a suit and tie, while a woman can indulge in some variety (though TV image consultants may have something to say about that, as Wilkinson observed in a pointed speech). ""It's not completely black and white,"" Weingarten adds. ""It seems that way -- and it's unfair -- but there's a lot going on beneath the surface, too."" Still, Stefanovic is glad he got the conversation going. On Monday's show, Wilkinson pointed out that his stunt even got attention in the Middle East. And now, at the urging of his colleagues, Stefanovic plans to change. His suit, that is. ""Only Lisa and (colleague Sylvia Jeffreys) know about the suit. They often remark that it's getting a bit stinky,"" he told Fairfax Media. ""I'm hoping to get it into the dry cleaners at the end of the year.""","Australian broadcaster wore same suit for a year .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The total economic impact of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is estimated at $1.6 trillion by 2009, a congressional committee said in a report released Tuesday. A soldier with the 101st Airborne Division guards an oil refinery near Baiji, Iraq. That is nearly double the $804 billion in direct war costs the White House requested so far from Congress, the Democratic-led Joint Economic Committee said. The committee estimated $1.3 trillion in war costs by the end of 2008 for Iraq, and the remainder for Afghanistan. The total war costs could grow to $3.5 trillion by 2017, the committee estimated. The higher total economic impact comes from, among other things, the cost of borrowing money to pay for the war, lost productivity, higher oil prices and the cost of health care for veterans, the committee said. The committee calculated the average cost of both wars for a family of four would be $20,900 from 2002 to 2008. The cost for a family of four would go up to $46,400 from 2002 to 2017, the committee said. The estimate was released as Democrats launch a new effort to force a withdrawal from the widely unpopular conflict. Senate Republicans dismissed the report as a political document, arguing that Democrats have ""hyped"" the war's impact on oil prices.  Watch how costs differ from pre-war projections, nonpartisan report Â» . ""For every dollar we spend directly in Iraq, we're going to pay another dollar for the indirect, but immediate, costs of the war,"" Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, said. ""We of the baby boom generation and our children and grandchildren will be paying for this war for a very long time to come."" ""We cannot afford this war -- $12 billion dollars a month?"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said. ""We just can't. We can't continue."" Schumer said finances will become a significant factor in the ongoing debate regarding the course of the conflicts. ""The cost of the war is becoming the $800 billion gorilla in the room when it comes to opposition in the war,"" he said. ""It is becoming the first thing that people mention after the loss of life when they're opposed to this war."" ""And the people who mention it, many of them, are not people who were against the war in the past,"" Schumer added. Office of Budget and Management Director Jim Nussle dismissed the report, saying ""the Congressional leadership is attempting to manipulate economic data for public relations purposes."" ""There are several ... distortions within the report, such as attempting to tie war costs to overall business investment and the price of oil."" Republicans, who said they were not included in the preparation of the report, also said the country has little choice but continue to bear the costs of the war. ""We have been protected from attack here at home,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky said.  ""There's progress that is obviously being made in Iraq."" ""We need to finish the job, and finish the job is to leave Iraq in a condition that it can defend itself and be an ally in the war on terror,"" he said. ""What's their alternative?"" Don Stewart, a McConnell spokesman, asked of the Democrats. ""Should we not fund veterans? Should we not send MRAPs [armored personal carriers] to Iraq? Not fund the GI Bill? ""And how much will oil cost if the progress in Iraq is reversed and al Qaeda shuts down the oil deliveries? What will that do to the markets?"" Stewart asked. Stewart called the report ""a Democrat report, prepared by the head of the Democrat campaign committee"" -- a reference to Schumer, the head of the party's effort to add Senate seats in 2008. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino accused the Democrats of releasing the report for partisan reasons and to ""muddy the waters"" after a series of positive reports from Iraq -- including a reduction in violence, increased economic capacity of the country, and signs of continued political reconciliation ""from the bottom up."" ""It's positive and we hope it is a trend that will take hold,"" Perino said. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Ted Barrett, Becky Brittain, and K.D.

"(CNN) -- French soccer star Nicolas Anelka has decided to quit English Premier League club West Bromwich Albion following his punishment for making a controversial ""quenelle"" gesture. Anelka was last month banned for five matches and fined Â£80,000 ($130,000) by the English Football Association following an incident during a match in December. Anelka was widely criticized by performing the ""quenelle"" -- which involves pointing a straightened arm downwards while touching the shoulder of that arm with the other hand -- after scoring against West Ham. The gesture, which he said was dedicated to his comedian friend Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala -- who uses it as part of his act -- is believed by some to be a Nazi salute in reverse and has been linked with anti-Semitism in Anelka's homeland. An Independent Regulatory Commission was asked to consider if the gesture was ""abusive and/or indecent and/or insulting and/or improper,"" and ""included a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or religion or belief."" Both charges were proved, said the commission, but it added it did not believe Anelka to be a racist. West Brom, which is battling to avoid relegation from the top flight, decided not to appeal against the judgment. ""I have taken the decision to free myself and put an end to the contract linking me with West Bromwich Albion,"" Anelka wrote in French on his Twitter page on Friday -- his 35th birthday. ""Following talks between the club and me, propositions were made to me in order to reintegrate me into the squad under certain conditions that I cannot accept. ""Wishing to retain my integrity, I have therefore taken the decision to free myself and put an end to the contract linking me with West Bromwich Albion to 2014, with immediate effect."" West Brom, however, said Friday it had yet to hear officially from Anelka -- whose ban was due to start this weekend, with the club outside the Premier League's bottom three on goal difference, having 10 matches to play. It said his Twitter statement was ""highly unprofessional"" and constituted ""gross misconduct"" -- and said it had given the striker 14 days' notice of termination as required by his contract. ""The club notes Nicolas Anelka is unwilling to agree to the conditions set by it which may have enabled his suspension to be lifted and for him to resume training,"" it said in a second statement. ""These conditions were, firstly, that the club required Nicolas Anelka to apologize to it, its supporters, sponsors and the wider community for the impact and consequences of his gesture made on December 28 and secondly, that he accept a substantial fine."" The FA had considered appealing against Anelka's punishment, having been criticized by anti-racism groups over its alleged leniency. ""We do not consider there is a real prospect of successfully appealing to extend the sanction imposed,"" the FA's director of governance Darren Bailey said Thursday. ""The grounds of appeal available to us are limited to legal challenges or to circumstances in which the sanction imposed is 'so unduly lenient as to be unreasonable'. That is a high test."" Anelka joined West Brom on a one-year deal in August, and his two goals against West Ham on December 28 were his first for the club. He continued to play while the matter was being investigated, but was sidelined in February due to a knee injury. Anelka has played for many of Europe's biggest clubs, including Real Madrid, Juventus, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and Fenerbahce, as well as a short but highly-paid stint with Chinese team Shanghai Shenhua. He played for France on 69 occasions, winning the 2000 European Championship, but his only World Cup appearance in 2010 ended in disgrace as he was expelled from the squad following an argument with coach Raymond Domenech. Anelka was subsequently banned for 18 matches by the French federation, but decided to end his international career rather than serve it.","Nicolas Anelka announces he will leave English Premier League club West Brom .

"No other instrument or object in American society is more vilified and maligned -- or evokes more emotion and passionate debate -- than the firearm. Any category of death by unnatural causes should get attention. However, when that death occurs as the result of a gun being illegally used, reason and logic are marginalized, myths become facts and emotion drives the conversation. The problem with the gun in America is that the left has politicized it. An entire advocacy has been developed and is part of their political platform. Their call for gun control is deceptively wrapped around a theme of reducing street violence and mass killings. The flaw in their argument is that none of the remedies they offer to reduce these senseless acts has anything to do with why this violence occurs. For the anti-gun cabal, this is more about defeating a political adversary, the influential National Rifle Association, than it is about reducing gun violence. Universal background checks and limiting magazine capacity are offered as reasonable approaches to reducing violence. Neither of these suggestions is directly associated with gun violence. Instead, these technical fixes frustrate the overwhelming number of law-abiding American gun owners. Our system of jurisprudence is predicated on punishing those individuals directly involved in committing crime, not those who are not. Gun control has never worked to eradicate violence. The cities of Chicago and Washington have had some of the strictest gun laws in America, yet they continue to experience high levels of gun-related, violent crime. A little-talked-about truth is that gun control in America has its roots in racism. Its original intent was to keep firearms out of the hands of black people, more specifically, newly-freed slaves. As Charles C.W. Cooke noted in his article ""The Great Equalizer,"" civil rights champion Ida B. Wells said this about the value of bearing arms, ""...the only case where the proposed lynching (of a Black man) did not occur was where the men armed themselves."" She went on to say that the ""lesson that teaches, and which every Afro-American should ponder well, is that a Winchester rifle should have a place of honor in every black home and it should be used for that protection which the law refuses to give."" In a recent New York Times article, Charles W. Cooke quoted civil rights champion Ida B. Wells on the value of bearing arms: ""'...the only times an Afro-American who was assaulted got away has been when he had a gun and used it in self-defense.'"" And, quoting her further: ""'... a Winchester rifle should have a place of honor in every black home, and it should be used for that protection which the law refuses to give.'"" Abolitionist Frederick Douglass also supported the right of blacks to arm themselves to guard against mob violence. As noted in Stephen P. Halbrook's book, ""That Every Man Be Armed: The Evolution of a Constitutional Right,"" Douglass believed that ""slaves without arms"" could never attain freedom.  Even the U.S. Congress at the time recognized the key role that arming blacks played in the ending of slavery. In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court granted Otis McDonald, a Chicago resident, that same protection by validating his right to keep and bear arms when they struck down the city's unreasonable gun control ordinance. McDonald sued Chicago, claiming that the restriction prevented him from protecting himself and his home from gang violence. Preventing private citizens the right to arm themselves for their own defense is a de facto death sentence. Here are more effective ways to reduce gun violence: . First, let's rid ourselves of the fantasy that strict gun control is even achievable. In his blog for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Marquette University law professor Rick Esenberg said that ""such a conversation about gun violence should be tempered by constitutional, political and practical realities. We are not about to ban the private ownership of guns in the United States."" Second, end social engineering experiments in the criminal justice system that see criminal perpetrators in a warped view as victims of society to be treated leniently. Punishment, when applied early in a criminal's career, is an effective deterrent to crime. Finally, stop conditioning society that guns are evil. They save many more lives than they take. Instead, start providing gun safety education that teaches people to respect firearms, not fear them.","The CNN Guns Project explores the role of guns in the United States .
Clarke says many gun restrictions aren't directly associated with gun violence .

"(CNN)  -- Usain Bolt put his 100m nightmare behind him to claim gold in the 200m final at the world championships in Daegu Saturday. Bolt, disqualified for a false start in the final of the shorter sprint, made no mistake this time as he powered to victory in 19.40 seconds, the fourth fastest of all time. ""I feel great. I'm still the best. After the false start on Sunday, I was extremely disappointed not to have given myself the chance to defend my 100m title,"" Bolt said, AFP reported. ""The 200m represented a great opportunity for me to put it behind me and move on, and I've been determined to do so all week,"" he added, AFP reported. Olympic champion Bolt was defending the title he won in Berlin in 2009 and the outcome never looked in doubt once he had come safely out of his blocks and quickly made up ground on Walter Dix of the United States on his outside. Dix took silver in 19.70 seconds with France's Christophe Lemaitre in bronze as he broke the 20 seconds barrier for the first time. Bolt will get the chance to add to his gold tally when his Jamaican team defend their 4 x 100m relay title Sunday. Meanwhile, South African Oscar Pistorius received his silver medal in a ceremony for the men's 4 x 400m relay, won Friday by the United States. Pistorius is the first non-able bodied athlete to win a medal in the world championships, but controversially was left of the the South African team for the final, having run the first leg in the qualifier. South African officials claimed he was omitted on merit, but the double amputee clearly remained unhappy with the decision despite the team's success. ""Well done to the SA 4x400 relay team, they got a silver. Was really hard watching knowing I deserved to be part of it. Off to my bed, nyt all,"" he wrote on this Twitter blog after the race. ""Re all the messages, receiving a lot of questions I dont know the answers to. Have the 2nd fastest time in SA and ran a 45.3 this wk,"" he added. In other final action Saturday in South Korea, the United States extended their dominance in the women's 4 x 400 meter relay, claiming a fourth straight world championship gold ahead of Jamaica and Russia. Kenya's Asbel Kiprop added the world 1500m title to his Olympic crown as the 22-year-old held off compatriot Silas Kiplagat in the charge for the line. American Matthew Centrowitz took a surprise bronze behind them. Australia's Sally Pearson stormed to victory in the women's 100m hurdles in the third fastest time of all time, 12.28 seconds, leaving American pair Danielle Carruthers and Dawn Harper with silver and bronze. In the men's javelin Matthias de Zordo of Germany shocked defending champion Andreas Thorkildsen to relegate the Norwegian to silver. Russia's Anna Chicherova won the women's world high jump title after countback with a best of 2.03m. Two-time defending champion Blanka Vlasic of Croatia cleared the same height, but had more attempts at earlier heights.","Usain Bolt wins men's 200m title in Daegu in 19.40 seconds .

"Jerusalem (CNN)  -- Researchers said Wednesday for the first time they have found what they believe to be pieces of a burial shroud from the time of Jesus. The find is of importance because tests on the shroud and the body it wrapped revealed the earliest proven case of leprosy in the Old City of Jerusalem. And in addition, the weave of the shroud raises fresh doubts about the Shroud of Turin, which many people believe was used to wrap the body of Jesus. According to researchers involved in the excavation and subsequent testing, the recently discovered shroud lends more credible evidence that the Shroud of Turin does not date to Roman times when Jesus died but from a later period. The latest shroud was found in a tomb complex on the edge of the Old City of Jerusalem. ""This is the first time that we have a shroud from the time of Jesus,"" said Shimon Gibson, the excavation director. He called such a find in the Jerusalem area unique because the high humidity levels in the city do not normally allow for the preservation of organic material. Gibson said the remains of the man covered in the cloth consisted of different wrappings for the body and the head, which was consistent with burial practices of the era. He also said research had shown that the weave of the cloth was a simple one, much different from the more complex Shroud of Turin's. The origin of the Shroud of Turin, a burial cloth that some believe bears the image of Jesus, is a source of great controversy, with many academics arguing it dates from the Middle Ages and not the time of Jesus. The burial cave, which has been dubbed the Tomb of the Shroud, was first uncovered in 2000 and was one of more than 70 separate family tombs of the first century. It is in a location described in the Bible as the ""Field of Blood,"" next to the area where Judas, the apostle who betrayed Jesus, is said to have committed suicide. Based on the tomb's location and the style of the shroud wrappings, researchers have said the shrouded man was an affluent member of Jerusalem society. Because of the unique nature of the find, the remains of the shroud and the bodily remains were subject to molecular and DNA testing. Researchers said they were surprised to find that the shrouded man suffered from both leprosy and tuberculosis. The discovery of leprosy was found in DNA samples taken from the skeletal remains and is the earliest proven case of the disease, according to Hebrew University professor Mark Spigelman. It is likely the shrouded man died from tuberculosis, Spigelman said, and its presence in other remains found at the site suggest ""the significant impact social diseases such as tuberculosis had on society from the low socioeconomic groups up to the more affluent families, such as Tomb the Shroud in first-century Jerusalem.""","Excavation chief: ""This is the first time that we have a shroud from the time of Jesus""

"(CNN) -- The commander of the U.S. Navy's Blue Angels stepped down Friday in the wake of a subpar performance at a Virginia air show this week. ""I performed a maneuver that had an unacceptably low minimum altitude. This maneuver, combined with other instances of not meeting the airborne standard that makes the Blue Angels the exceptional organization that it is, led to my decision to step down,"" Cmdr. Dave Koss said in a statement, referring to the Lynchburg, Virginia, Regional Airshow. He will be replaced by Capt. Greg McWherter, who was the flight demonstration team's previous commander. Air shows have been in the spotlight recently because of concerns over safety. A pilot performing stunts in an east Florida air show in March died in a fiery crash when the Russian military plane he was flying in broke formation and fell to the ground. Also in March, engine trouble at an air show in Texas caused a plane to plummet, leaving a white trail behind as it dove toward a wooded area. The two stunt pilots onboard survived. The Blue Angels have canceled performances at the Rockford, Illinois, Airfest June 4-5 and the Evansville, Indiana, Freedom Festival Air Show June 11-12 because of the shakeup in leadership.","Cmdr.

"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says he feels no pressure to run for president at 47 because a certain political rival of his is toying with the idea well into her 60s. ""I could run 20 years from now and still be about the same age as the former Secretary of State (Hillary Clinton) is right now,"" the Republican governor said in an interview Sunday with CNN affiliate WITI. Walker, who was recently re-elected for a second term, says he believes that the closer you get to running for president, the more you realize how crazy you have to be to actually do it. ""The closer you get to something like that the more you realize -- and I say this only half jokingly -- that you have to be crazy to want to be president,"" he said. ""And anyone who has seen pictures of this president or any of the former presidents can see the before and after. No matter how fit, no matter how young they are, they age pretty rapidly."" Noting the toll a presidency takes on one's health, Walker opened up about his bald spot becoming an issue on the campaign trail. ""One of the frustrations for my campaign staff is they felt -- for whatever reason -- my opponent largely faced little or no scrutiny about anything, so it was an interesting contrast when I talked about the bald spot on the back of my head, which has admittedly grown beyond just being the focal point of a story or two,"" Scott said. ""It was just one of those things where you raise your eyebrows and say, 'really?' But, you know, it is what it is."" But despite his national presence and ongoing speculation about a 2016 presidential run, Walker says that he still feels compelled to serve out his term as governor. ""The only thing I think someone ... should run for president not because they want to be or yearn to be, but because they feel called to,"" he said. ""Right now, I still feel called to be the governor of the state of Wisconsin, and I'm going to do the best job I can over the next four years."" This is not the first time the potential 2016 candidate has taken a dig at Clinton's age. Shortly after the latest midterm elections, Walker told Fox News that Clinton, who recently turned 67, embodies ""old"" politics. ""I think the biggest loser (in the midterms) was Hillary Clinton,"" Walker said. ""She embodies Washington. She embodies that old, tired top-down approach from the government.

"(CNN) -- The morning after teams of gunmen carried out a brazen series of attacks across southern Mumbai, killing scores of people and taking hostages in three locations, the situation showed little signs of a quick resolution. A series of gunshots rang through the air at the Oberoi Hotel Thursday morning, where about 100 members of a specialized unit of the Indian police undertook an operation to rescue four to five foreigners hostages on the 19th floor. A few blocks away, a series of gunfire sent curious onlookers scurrying for cover at the Taj Mahal Hotel. Shortly afterward, police escorted dozens of people -- who appeared to be mostly westerners -- out of the hotel. A.N. Roy, the police chief of Maharashtra state, where Mumbai is located, said all hostages there had been freed. A standoff at a third location -- the Cama Hospital for women and infants -- also appeared to have been resolved by Thursday morning, CNN's sister station CNN-IBN reported. It was not immediately known whether gunmen at the hospital fled or were killed. Israel Foreign Ministry was attempting to locate about 20 Israeli nationals missing in the city as police said four suspected gunmen took cover in a building called Nariman House, where several Jewish families live. Police said gunmen fired indiscriminately from the building throughout the night. Stray bullets killed a couple in their home and a 16-year-old boy who stepped outside, police said. Authorities asked residents in Mumbai to stay inside, uncertain whether other attacks were planned in the city. That warning failed to stop knots of curious onlookers from strolling Thursday through the streets of this financial center to survey the damage at some of the 10 sites that, without warning, had turned into battlegrounds late Wednesday. Mumbai remained locked down with police checking cars randomly. The stock market in the city -- the financial capital of India -- was closed, as were schools and colleges. Government officials said the attacks caught them completely unawares, with no intelligence chatter indicating that such a coordinated assault was in the works. Instead, authorities had focused their attention on securing movie theaters and malls after receiving indications that terrorists were intending to attack those locations, CNN-IBN reported. ""It's war on Mumbai,"" read the banner headline on the front page of The Times of India. Mumbai police spokesman Satish Katsa put the death toll to be at least 85 and another 200 wounded. An earlier report said an additional nine attackers had been killed. At the five-star Taj Mahal Hotel, a fire continued to burn hours after it began on the top floor of the majestic, century-old Victorian building popular among Western tourists and diplomats. CNN employee Yasmin Wong was among the guests at the Taj Mahal who holed up in her fourth-floor room for several hours, then ran out her door, down the stairs, into the lobby and past the pool in the rear of the hotel to safety. ""I saw a few casualties on the way down,"" she told CNNI. She said she also saw the guest in a room above hers. He had smashed out his fifth-floor window to escape the fire and was hanging out his window, but no one was there to help. ""He was just screaming and yelling for help,"" she said, adding that she did not know what became of the man. ""I'd been instructed just to get out of my room,"" she said. Bhushan Gagrani, a spokesman for Maharashtra, said no one had claimed responsibility for the attacks. But several Indian news outlets reported receiving e-mails from a group calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen that claimed responsibility for the attacks. CNN was not able to verify the reports. Gagrani said nine suspects were arrested overnight and three other people were detained for questioning. CNN-IBN reported that seven of the nine arrested are fishermen. The network said that police found a boat loaded with explosives near the Taj Mahal. Hemant Karkare, chief of Mumbai police's anti-terrorism squad, was among the fatalities at the Hotel Oberoi, officials said. In addition, 11 other police were killed, Deshmukh said. He said officials did not know how many attackers were involved. A man told local television that he was in the Oberoi around 10 p.m. when gunmen entered the lobby and began rounding up guests, asking for anyone with a U.S. or British passport and taking hostage about 15 of them. The Cafe Leopold, another popular hangout for Western tourists, was also targeted, and one police official said an attack occurred at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station, a Victorian building. CNN-IBN reported the attacks began shortly before 10 p.m. (12:30 p.m. ET) Wednesday and witnesses were reporting new explosions and gunfire into early Thursday morning. A.N. Roy, the police chief of Maharashtra, said the gunmen used grenades and automatic weapons. India has suffered a number of attacks in recent years, including a string of bombs that ripped through packed Mumbai commuter trains and platforms during rush hour in July 2006. About 209 people were killed in that attack. Last July, a series of synchronized bomb blasts in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad left 49 dead and more than 100 wounded, police said. But Paresh Parihar, a businessman in Mumbai, described Wednesday's attacks as unlike any previous ones. ""They really don't fear for their lives or any other activity that could put them in danger,"" he told CNN. ""This is really a very unusual situation."" Mumbai ordered schools closed Thursday.

"Former Guatemalan dictator Efrain Rios Montt waited until closing arguments to speak in his own defense in his genocide trial in Guatemala City on Thursday. He denied he had any role as head of state in the atrocities the military carried out on indigenous Ixil Mayans during his brief rule from 1982 to 1983. ""I never authorized, I never signed, I never proposed, I never ordered these attacks against a people, ethnicity or religion,"" Rios Montt said Thursday. Prosecutors have asked for 75-year sentences for the 86-year-old former leader and his intelligence chief, Mauricio Rodriguez Sanchez. The landmark trial marks the first time a former head of state has been tried for genocide by his country's own judicial system. Guatemala confronts a dark chapter . While Rios Montt was in power, the military used the threat of leftist rebels as a guise to exterminate Ixil villages accused of harboring insurgents, prosecutors argued. According to prosecutors, the campaign led to the genocide of more than 1,700 Ixil Mayans. During his first and only address to the three-judge panel, Rios Montt said that the prosecution's contention that the chain of command places him at fault for the atrocities is false. He oversaw the day-to-day operations of the government, while the defense ministry had the final say over security matters, Rios Montt said. ""The head of state is nothing more than a public servant,"" he said. ""Each regional commander is responsible for what happens and what he lets happen in his territory."" The former ruler said he does not accept the charges of genocide and crimes against humanity leveled against him. ""I was not a commander; I was a head of state!"" he shouted. Trial near completion . Closing arguments in the trial, which opened in March, are expected to conclude on Thursday. A verdict could come any moment after that. The first three weeks of the trial moved fast, with many Ixil Mayan witnesses testifying about rape, torture, killings and the razing of their villages. But a number of appeals and motions by the defense in several courts threatened to derail the process. At one point, a judge annulled the testimony in the trial. Legal wrangling over the insertion and ejection of lawyers on the defense side and whether certain evidence was admissible resulted in sometimes contradicting rulings from various courts. The trial was suspended at one point, as the country's Constitutional Court and an appeals court began untangling the mess. The genocide trial was effectively stalled for nearly three weeks before the judges ruled they were in compliance with all of the rulings from the other courts. Facing legacy of civil war . Rios Montt came to power in a coup and led a military junta while Guatemala was in a bloody civil war between the army and leftist guerrillas. The war did not end until 1996, leaving more than 200,000 people dead and 1 million as refugees. Prosecutors argued that Rios Montt was aware of the repressive strategies that the military was using against anyone suspected of being a guerrilla, such as killings, forced disappearances and kidnappings. His defense has argued that he never explicitly ordered the killings of the indigenous group.","Efrain Rios Montt of Guatemala addresses the court for the first time Thursday .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Hong Kong authorities began clearing barricades at a section of a downtown protest camp on Tuesday, taking action against the pro-democracy demonstrators that have occupied parts of the city for almost two months. The clearance followed a court order to remove obstructions outside CITIC Tower, a 33-story office building close to the main protest site in Hong Kong's Admiralty district. There were no signs of resistance from protesters, some of whom helped bailiffs, police and CITIC representatives move the metal barricades away from the area covered by the court injunction. Earlier, others packed up their tents to pre-empt the bailiffs. The court order only covers a small part of the main protest site, which sprawls over a major eight-lane highway that connects Hong Kong island's main financial and commercial districts. Hong Kong's High Court has also issued a separate injunction to clear sections of a smaller protest site in Mong Kok, a densely populated neighborhood that has witnessed some of the most violent clashes. Earlier attempts by riot police to clear the demonstrators have not been successful, and negotiations between student leaders and government representatives didn't yield any progress. In their early days, the protests brought tens of thousands of people onto the city's streets to call for full universal suffrage after Beijing said candidates for election in 2017 would have to be screened by a committee. However, their numbers have since dwindled and polls show that public support for the protesters is dropping. The city's government said on Monday that police ""would arrest anyone obstructing the bailiffs."" Hong Kong leader C.Y. Leung said on Tuesday that the protesters were breaching the law and there was no point to resist the court order.

"France's interior minister said Monday that based on intelligence analysis, ""a strong presumption exists"" that a French citizen named Maxime Hauchard participated in the ""despicable crimes"" shown on the latest video from ISIS. The video released over the weekend depicts the slayings of several men described by ISIS as Syrian soldiers and appears to show the aftermath of the beheading of U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig. While Hauchard's involvement is only alleged and investigations continue, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said intelligence analysis of the video suggests ""a very high probability that a French citizen has directly participated in the execution of these despicable crimes."" Public Prosecutor Francois Molins said authorities are investigating the possibility that a second French citizen may have been involved in the killings shown on the video. Hauchard, 22, went to Syria in 2013 after visiting Mauritania the previous year, Cazeneuve said. According to Molins, Hauchard is a ""self-radicalized"" jihadist who traveled to Syria under the guise of a humanitarian mission. He was known to French security services as far back as 2011, the prosecutor said. In July, Hauchard spoke to French broadcaster BFM, describing life as a fighter. ""Everything is paid for. Clothes are paid for. Weapons are not ours, we don't pay for them. Same for the missions, the guns,"" he said, according to a CNN translation of his remarks. ""The other day I wanted to buy shampoo. I wrote it down on the list -- we have a list where we write down stuff. Then the boss goes out shopping at the market. And he brings us back the shampoo, for example, without making us pay."" ""The goal as a group, the goal as a community is to establish the laws of Allah on Earth,"" he said. ""But from a personal point of view, it is martyrdom."" The video in which Hauchard is said to have appeared is widely considered the most brutal yet released by the terror group, which is also known by the acroynm ISIL as well as its self-given name, the Islamic State. U.S. President Barack Obama, in confirming Kassig's beheading, called the executions ""pure evil by a terrorist group that the world rightly associates with inhumanity."" More barbaric ISIS videos expected after Kassig's death, analyst says . The 16-minute production includes a lengthy segment on the group's history and shows in graphic detail beheadings of several men described as Syrian military pilots. Several men without masks, presumably ISIS fighters, are shown in that segment killing the men. The video doesn't show Kassig's death but does show a masked man dressed in black, speaking in what sounds like a English accent. A similar figure appeared in earlier videos depicting the apparent beheadings of Westerners. Kassig is the fifth Western hostage to be killed by ISIS since the United States and its allies began airstrikes against ISIS in August. ISIS is believed to be holding at least two more Western hostages: a 26-year-old female, American aid worker, and John Cantlie, a British journalist, who has appeared in a number of ISIS-produced videos. U.S. officials have credited the air campaign with stopping a wildly successful ISIS ground offensive and disrupting the group's ability to finance and plan its exploits. On Monday, the U.S. military said coalition warplanes conducted 31 airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq between Friday and Monday, hitting fighting positions, staging areas and units in the field, among other targets.

"After seven months of investigation and undercover work, federal officials have arrested a Virginia woman and accused her of lying to federal agents about involvement with the terrorist group ISIS. Heather Coffman, 29, of Henrico County, is charged with making a materially false statement or representation regarding an offense involving international and domestic terrorism. Authorities said they built their case against Coffman with information from a series of undercover interviews and inflammatory social media posts. Coffman first caught the attention of the FBI through her Facebook activity, according to a criminal complaint filed to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The complaint details many of Coffman's controversial Facebook posts and interactions. Investigators say that on June 23, using the name Ubeida Ametova (one of her many online aliases), Coffman listed her ""work and education"" on her Facebook account as ""jihad for Allah's sake."" Per the charges, she posted an image with the captions ""We are all ISIS, Islamic State of Iraq and Sham"" and also posted a picture of armed men and the black flag of ISIS, emblazoned with the words ""Virtues of the Mujahideen."" Authorities say that on July 8, using a second Facebook account, Coffman reposted the same images from her first account in addition to a picture of the ISIS flag surrounded by praying men armed with AK-47s. Opinion: What lures Americans to Syria fight? Coffman's Facebook activity prompted the FBI to obtain a search warrant for the account on August 4, leading investigators to discover a history of correspondence about ISIS. The criminal complaint details some of these exchanges, in which Coffman allegedly defends ISIS and rebukes those who criticize the terrorist group. She writes, ""I know...it's all Zionist propaganda though! If we can rid the world of them...then the world will be a better and peaceful place."" Additionally, investigators say that Coffman took credit for attempting to recruit her sister when she wrote, ""she know ISIS because I told her about them and got her into liking them lol"" and ""my dad is a little angry because I got her into all this jihad stuff."" Investigators said they also discovered a man whom Coffman claimed was her husband. According to Facebook communications detailed in the complaint, this man told Coffman that he hoped their future son would be ""Mujaheeden,"" and Coffman agreed, expressing her support for ""whatever you want to do."" Days later, as shown in the charges, Coffman told her ""husband"" that she hates gays and Zionists and ""they should all die."" On July 29, she warned him not to post pro-ISIS statuses on Facebook, and suggested that ""the NSA has already seen it."" Was arrested teen on his way to join ISIS? Coffman had multiple other Facebook accounts with a variety of user names, including Heather Coffman, Heather La'ahad, Heather Obeida La'ahad, Heather Ametova, and Ubeida Ametova, and which authorities say displayed varying degrees of radicalization. As of October 2, 2014, Coffman had set her location on one of the accounts to Hafsarjah, Idlib, Syria. Coffman's social media behavior presented a number of red flags to authorities, but officials said the information gathered by an undercover FBI agent from a series of interviews helped lead to the charges. Starting in July, an agent posing as an ISIS sympathizer routinely met with Coffman and began to investigate her recruitment network. After establishing a relationship, the undercover agent told Coffman about an associate who shared their views on Islam and was prepared to join the fight with ISIS in Syria. Per the complaint, Coffman revealed that she had experience connecting potential recruits with ISIS facilitators. She had begun to arrange travel to Syria for her ""husband,"" the online associate investigators had discovered, but their relationship ended and he had decided not to follow through. According to the criminal complaint, Coffman explained her frustration to the agent, saying, ""I set him up with the brothers who gave him a contact name and number in Turkey to get him across the border when it was time for training...I spoke to another brother about it who said he was shocked he is sitting around waiting in Macedonia and he is going to call the emir and fix that and get him to Turkey...but my account was disabled so I couldn't follow through with that. But I think he was just joking us about going."" How far does ISIS' global reach extend? On October 19, the undercover agent told Coffman about plans to travel overseas, search for routes into Syria, and find an ISIS contact, to which Coffman replied, suggesting she could help find a contact and facilitate travel. The undercover agent met with Coffman three times, on November 5, 6 and 7, according to the charges. During a recorded meeting in a hotel room on November 5, Coffman again offered to help find a contact and facilitate travel into Syria. After locating and vetting what she considered to be a legitimate facilitator, Coffman told the agent she would reach out and initiate the plans. But on November 6, Coffman told the agent her contact had gone dark and that she was still waiting for a response. Then on November 7, Coffman met again with the agent, this time with a third unidentified associate, and asked the agent to propose a list of questions that she would relay to the facilitator, because, as Coffman explained, she wanted all communication with the facilitator to go through her. In this meeting, Coffman, the agent, and the unidentified third associate created a code language to discuss plans without tipping off law enforcement.

"Outgoing Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, who said just a few weeks ago that Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst was ""wrong for the state of Iowa,"" has changed his tune. Harkin, who was an ardent supporter of Democratic Congressman Bruce Braley in the race to succeed him, sees promise in Ernst as she prepares to represent the Hawkeye state for the next six years. ""I think she has the potential to be one, yes,"" Harkin told reporters in typical ""Iowa nice"" fashion on Capitol Hill, when asked if Ernst would be a good senator. They all have the potential when they come here. I think maybe some of the statements she's made in the past -- I don't know -- you know people grow, people grow into jobs. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt."" The senator got into hot water while campaigning against her when he compared Ernst's looks to Taylor Swift as the race came to a close, though he's apparently shaken off the results. ""Obviously I was disappointed that Bruce Braley didn't get elected. Fine guy, great congressman, but hey, that's the breaks of elections, right?"" he said. Ernst beat Braley by eight points in the midterms earlier this month. Her win was a key seat Republicans needed to take the majority in the upper chamber. Harkin did reach out to Ernst on election night to congratulate her for running a ""great campaign"" but didn't offer any other details. Asked for advice he would give Ernst as he concludes his 40-year career in Washington, Harkin said ""if you want to be a good senator, when you come here, forget about the headlines, learn the rules, try to get on good committees, and think about the long term -- about what you can do for your state, for Iowa, in the long term because things don't happen overnight around here.

"Niamey, Niger (CNN) -- Two French citizens who were kidnapped in Niger's capital were killed -- apparently executed by their abductors -- during an attempted rescue mission, the French Defense Ministry said Sunday. ""During this rescue operation, the two hostages were killed, probably executed by their kidnappers. Two French soldiers were injured and many terrorists were killed,"" said a statement on the ministry's website. The two were seized by masked gunmen who burst into Le Toulousain, a restaurant owned by a French citizen, in Niamey Friday night. A witness said the bar was crowded and many people did not realize what was going on at first. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defense said it is believed that ""those behind the kidnapping were probably part of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)."" However, AQIM has not yet claimed responsibility. The group did acknowledge it was responsible for the abduction of five French citizens who have been missing since September. The spokesman said French Defense Minister Alain Juppe will travel to Niamey Monday to hold a news conference. No other details, including the identities of the two who were slain, were immediately available from official sources. The French newspaper Le Figaro identified the men as Antoine De Leocour and Vincent Delory, both 25. French President Nicolas Sarkozy condemned the killings in a statement Sunday, calling them a ""barbaric act."" He vowed that France will ""fight relentlessly against terrorism."" Niger's Voice of Sahel radio reported severe clashes between Niger army forces and the kidnappers early Saturday near the town of Ouallam, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) northwest of Niamey, the capital, and not far from the Mali border. The leader of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Abu Musab Abdul-Wadud, has warned France that if it does not withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, more French nationals would be endangered. ""If you want safety for your citizens who are held captive by us, then you must move quickly to take your soldiers out of Afghanistan according to a specific time table that you announce officially,"" Abdul-Wadud said. The five French citizens kidnapped in September were linked to French nuclear energy company Areva, which has been mining uranium for decades in Niger, one of the poorest countries in the world. France has already said it may begin to withdraw some troops from Afghanistan next year. Minister Herve Morin told French radio station RTL in late October that France will begin to transfer the control of certain districts to Afghans in 2011. Journalist Ibbo Daddy Abdoulaye contributed to this report.","NEW: Sarkozy calls the killings ""a barbaric act""

"(CNN) -- Last week, the news broke that Russian aircraft will commence patrolling the skies over the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Washington reacted mildly to Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu's announcement. The U.S. State Department questioned Moscow's rationale for operating off North American coastlines while insisting that such flights ""must be consistent with international law and conducted with due regard for the rights of other nations and the safety of other aircraft and of vessels."" That's about it. Nor should Washington go further than this pro forma statement. Why? Because an informal compact preserves freedom of the seas and skies. Coastal states grit their teeth and tolerate rivals' presence in exchange for their own freedom to operate along foreign shores. It's a form of reciprocity. Shoigu's announcement came the same week a Russian naval flotilla appeared off Australia's northern periphery, setting commentators abuzz Down Under. But Prime Minister Tony Abbott's government, like the Obama administration, struck the right, low-key note vis-ÃÂ -vis that voyage. Defense spokesmen noted that the Russian vessels -- guided-missile cruiser Varyag, along with a three-ship retinue -- were doing nothing unlawful or especially provocative. And indeed they weren't. No one claimed the Russian task force passed through Australian territorial waters, the 12-nautical-mile belt of sea off any coastal state's shores. (Although it could have done so, provided commanders complied with the rules of ""innocent passage."") No one claimed it placed Australian security at risk. As coastal states will, nevertheless, Canberra dispatched assets to keep watch. Royal Australian Navy men-of-war and surveillance aircraft took to sea and sky to monitor the Russian warships' whereabouts and, presumably, document their activities. And so things stand. Move, countermove: That's a normal day in the life of sea services. Why would Moscow go to the trouble of mounting a Pacific cruise so far from Russian shorelines? Thucydides, the chronicler of the Peloponnesian War, offers a starting point for answering such questions. He lists ""fear, honor and interest"" as three of the prime movers for human actions. Each is probably shaping decisions in Moscow. Take Thucydides' motives in reverse order. The Russian leadership probably saw an interest in telegraphing how seriously it takes the G20 summit that has been taking place in Brisbane. It may also want to impress prospective Southeast Asian buyers of Russian weaponry. Displaying naval prowess in Australia's extended neighborhood, then, could constitute part of a sales pitch. Artfully employed, ships remain tokens of political and economic interest, today as throughout maritime history. And honor? Russia clearly wants to announce, yet again, its return to history. A painful interlude of weakness followed the Soviet Union's downfall. Sending a rejuvenated Pacific Fleet to promenade around the region helps banish bad memories while restoring luster to Russia's reputation as a great power. On the personal level, moreover, the cruise could represent President Vladimir Putin's way of replying to Abbott's vow to ""shirtfront,"" or upbraid, Putin over last summer's downing of a Malaysian airliner over Ukraine. Childish? Maybe. But hardly unprecedented. Political leaders have been known to use implements of state to avenge personal slights. Lastly, fear. Moscow doubtless feels beleaguered. The international community reacted vehemently to Russia's proxy war against Ukraine, levying an array of sanctions. Russia's isolation is a problem of its own making, to be sure. But staging naval forces in the South Pacific reminds the West and its allies that Moscow still has options. In all likelihood, then, a variety of motives are at work. And yet forbearance remains the best posture, regardless of what is behind Russian actions. Why? To uphold the principle of freedom of the seas. Australian warships and warplanes traverse the global commons -- the seas and skies beyond any coastal state's jurisdiction, open to unfettered use by all -- every day. The same goes for American ships and planes, those from Japan and South Korea, and on and on. Indeed, it's virtually impossible to project power into faraway regions or carry on marine commerce unless the commons remains open. Such untrammeled liberty is an asset beyond price. Accordingly, it behooves great sea powers such as Australia and the United States -- the biggest beneficiaries of freedom of the sea -- to make every effort to keep the commons a commons. That means refraining from words or acts that corrode the freedom embedded in international law and practice. Overreacting to routine use of the commons because we dislike the power using it sets a double standard: freedom for me, but not for thee. That's the worst way to respond. Better to watch, wait and keep mum until and unless a foreign navy does something unlawful. In a sense the seafaring world is renewing a very old argument about the law of the sea. Romans saw an ever-increasing swath of the Mediterranean Sea as ""mare nostrum,"" or ""our sea."" In this view the sea was subject to ownership. Dutchman Hugo Grotius, one of the forefathers of international law, countered during the 17th century with the idea of the free sea, or ""mare liberum."" Beyond the range of a cannon shot from shore -- the farthest offshore a government could exert control -- mariners were at liberty to pursue trade and commerce, project naval force, and undertake any number of seaborne ventures. Grotius' foil -- ironically, since it was Great Britain that later midwifed the liberal maritime order we know today -- was the English jurist John Selden. Selden put forth the countervailing doctrine of ""mare clausum,"" the closed sea. The gist of mare clausum was that governments were entitled to exercise sovereign jurisdiction over sea space, much as they did on dry land. Coastal states could literally rule the waves -- just as they wielded a monopoly of legitimate force within their terrestrial frontiers. Selden insisted that England was sovereign over northwestern European waters -- including the approaches from the Atlantic Ocean high seas to Dutch seaports. Small wonder Grotius wanted to deny rival England the right to dictate the terms of his homeland's access to the sea lanes -- or cut that vital lifeline altogether. A similar quarrel played out in South Asia, where Portugal styled itself the lord of the Indian Ocean while the Dutch clamored for free access. Hugo Grotius' doctrine of free seas ultimately seemed to win out. Grotius remains a fixture in international-law circles, while John Selden is a largely forgotten figure. But there are few permanent victories in legal debates. Protesting deployments like Russia's too loudly gives Selden's intellectual descendants comfort -- to the detriment of freedom of the seas. China, for instance, claims the right to make the rules governing merchant and naval traffic crisscrossing the South China Sea. It wants to forbid military surveillance, underwater surveys, and other endeavors explicitly permitted by the law of the sea. It wants to amend the system by fiat. Australia could unwittingly advance China's project. If Canberra objected vehemently to plainly lawful maritime endeavors, that is, it would have implied that Beijing has a point when it constricts freedom of the seas and skies for fellow seafaring states. That point being that the nearby coastal state can regulate who operates in the commons, who doesn't, and on what terms. By soft-pedaling the Russian deployment, on the other hand, Australia denies proponents of the closed sea that aid and comfort. And this is a deployment worth soft-pedaling in any event. The Australian press duly pointed out that one of the four Russian vessels was an oceangoing tugboat, sent along in case one of the combatant ships suffers a mechanical breakdown or some other cataclysm. Dispatching a tug as a matter of routine betokens a navy less than confident in its hardware, material upkeep and basic seamanship. U.S. Navy expeditionary forces don't travel with tugboats. We don't expect to break down at sea. The same goes for the Royal Australian Navy and the other highly professional services fielded by America's allies. Target audiences notice such things -- and they detract from the political impact of a naval deployment. One doubts this month's voyage will reap much benefit for Moscow. So let's make softly, softly the principle guiding diplomacy toward naval voyages -- those undertaken by prospective foes as well as by allies and friends.","James Holmes: Mild reaction correct over Russia's Caribbean plan .

"A New York man who pleaded guilty in January to charges of aiding al Qaeda was ready to be a suicide bomber for the organization, but was told he needed more religious instruction, according to a document obtained by CNN on Thursday. Bryant Neal Vinas says he spent time in the mountains of Waziristan with al Qaeda members. Bryant Neal Vinas gave an interview in March to Belgian prosecutors as part of a terrorism case there involving a cell he was associated with. CNN obtained the prosecution-prepared interview summary document from a Belgian defense attorney, and it was authenticated by both a federal prosecutor in New York and Vinas' defense attorney. The French-language document gives a detailed picture of how Vinas traveled from New York to Pakistan and what he did while he was there. Vinas pleaded guilty in January to charges of conspiracy to murder U.S. nationals, providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization and receiving military-type training from a foreign terrorist organization, the FBI said Wednesday. He admitted involvement in an attack on a U.S. military base in Afghanistan in September 2008, according to an indictment filed under seal and made public Wednesday. In addition, authorities said he provided al Qaeda with information about the New York transit system and the Long Island Railroad. Vinas, 26, is an American citizen, said a source close to the investigation. He was arrested in Pakistan, the source said. According to the document obtained Thursday, the Queens, New York-born Vinas converted from Catholicism to Islam in 2004. He hooked up with al Qaeda in Pakistan three years later, and by September 2007 was determined to wage jihad in Afghanistan, the document says. He left New York exactly six years after al Qaeda struck the city and arrived in Lahore, a major city in eastern Pakistan, on September 12, 2007. With the help of a friend he had known in New York, who was connected in militant circles, Vinas sought out individuals in Lahore who could help connect him to jihadists fighting in Afghanistan, according to the document. Weeks later, the document says, Vinas was in Afghanistan's Kunar province, a hotbed of the insurgency, with a group of 20 insurgents who crept up near an American combat outpost. At the last minute, they decided not to fire mortars on the base because American war planes were circling overhead, the document says. Before launching the raid, Vinas said, recruits were required to sign a number of forms. From the document, it is not clear whether those forms constituted formal membership in al Qaeda, but Vinas stated that ""it was not necessary to sign documents or take part in a ceremony to become a member of al Qaeda."" Later in the document, he was quoted as saying he succeeded in becoming a full member of al Qaeda. Vinas then returned to Mohmand, an agency in Pakistan's tribal areas, the document says. His handlers then asked him to become a suicide bomber. He agreed, and was sent to Peshawar, Pakistan, to receive more instructions. But Vinas told investigators that his handlers decided he needed more religious instruction before he would be ready to become a suicide bomber, the document said. After his instruction in Peshawar, Vinas said, he traveled into the mountains of Waziristan in Pakistan's tribal areas. Vinas said that during his time there he spent a lot of time with members of al Qaeda, including operatives from Saudi Arabia and Yemen, according to the document. Between March and July 2008, Vinas said he attended three al Qaeda training courses, learning how to fire an AK-47, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and handguns. He also familiarized himself with explosives and was taught to make suicide bombing vests. At the end of his training, Vinas said, his handlers judged that he was qualified to participate in missile attacks against American, NATO and Afghan bases in Afghanistan, the document said. In September 2008, Vinas said, he traveled to a town near the Afghan frontier where he joined a group of jihadists including al Qaeda fighters. Creeping toward the Afghan border, he said, the group fired rockets toward an American combat outpost in Afghanistan. This is the attack Vinas pleaded guilty to in January, authorities said Wednesday. After launching the attack, Vinas spent several weeks in the mountains of Waziristan near the Afghan border. It was there, Vinas said, that he had detailed conversations with ""al Qaeda chiefs,"" according to the document. Vinas is quoted as saying the subject of those discussions included attacks in the West, including in the United States. Vinas is not quoted in the document elaborating further. Vinas stated that he left Pakistan's tribal areas in October 2008 and returned to Peshawar in search of a wife. That's where he was arrested a few weeks later. Vinas is quoted in the document saying that during his stay in Pakistan he spent time with a number of Belgian and French citizens who had traveled to Pakistan's tribal areas in early 2008, and who, like Vinas, received military training there. In December 2008, several members of this group and some of their Brussels associates were arrested on their return to Europe after security services received indications they might be plotting a terrorist attack in Belgium. Belgian magistrates wanted to question Vinas in March for this reason. Vinas pleaded guilty on January 28 in a closed hearing, according to court documents. At the time, the case was filed naming ""John Doe"" as a defendant and was sealed. The FBI's New York office would not say whether Vinas has been sentenced or comment on why the case was sealed. It said Vinas is in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. Vinas is also known as ""Ibrahim,"" ""Bashir al-Ameriki"" and ""Ben Yameen al-Kandee,"" according to the indictment unsealed Wednesday. In Pakistan, according to the document, Vinas said he met with the alleged leader of the Franco-Belgian cell, a Tunisian, who Belgian intelligence sources have told CNN was Moez Garsallaoui. Garsallaoui is the husband of Malika el Aroud, a Belgian woman who has been described as an ""icon"" of the jihadist movement because her former husband assassinated Ahmed Shah Massoud, the head of Afghanistan's anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, two days before 9/11. El Aroud was one of those arrested in Brussels and is awaiting trial, accused of having teamed up with her new husband to recruit Europeans to fight Jihad. In 2006, CNN interviewed Garsallaoui and El Aroud in Switzerland. Garsallaoui, who Belgian counterterrorism sources believe is still at large in the tribal areas between Afghanistan and Pakistan, boasted to other group members that he had carried out an attack on an American base in Afghanistan, firing rockets from Pakistan, according to legal documents obtained by CNN. It is not clear whether Vinas also joined Garsallaoui on these raids.","Man has pleaded guilty to charges of aiding al Qaeda .

"A twin-engine plane crashed into a Chicago house shortly after takeoff from Midway International Airport early Tuesday, killing the pilot and narrowly missing a couple who were sleeping in the residence, officials said. The pilot of the Aerocommander 500 cargo plane reported engine problems and asked controllers to let him return to Midway shortly before the craft slammed into the house about a quarter-mile short of a runway at 2:42 a.m., Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Elizabeth Isham Cory said. The craft smashed into a living room, stopping just 8 inches from a couple who were sleeping in an adjacent bedroom in the 1.5-story brick house just southeast of the airport, Chicago Fire Department official Michael Fox said. The couple were not injured. ""They were very lucky. ... They were in a bedroom next to the living room, and the living room is gone,"" said Fox, the fire department's chief of special operations. The name of the pilot, who was the only person aboard the craft, was not immediately released. The pilot was trying to land at Midway when the crash happened, said Tim Sorensen, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board. Video from CNN affiliate WGN shows the tail of the plane sticking out of the home's smashed front end. Firefighters put a layer of foam on leaking aviation fuel before it could reach an ignition source and start a fire, Fox said. The pilot had intended to fly to an Ohio State University airport near Columbus, according to the FAA. An investigation into what caused the crash will take up to a year, but a preliminary report could be released in a week, Sorensen said.","Wreckage came within 8 inches of sleeping couple, fire official says .

"(CNN)The second annual edition of the Walk Free Foundation's Global Slavery Index has found that globally, almost 36 million people are subject to modern slavery. While incidences of slavery were found in every one of the 167 countries surveyed, five countries -- India, China, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Russia -- accounted for nearly 22 million people (61%) suffering in bondage. The worst offender, India, accounted for an estimated 14.29 million people. Human slavery, the report states, is defined as ""human trafficking, forced labor, debt bondage, forced or servile marriage, or commercial sexual exploitation."" Surge in cases . The report found an increase of 20% on the foundation's findings a year ago, although it attributed the rise to more sophisticated data collection and analysis. ""There is an assumption that slavery is an issue from a bygone era. Or that it only exists in countries ravaged by war and poverty,"" Andrew Forrest, Chairman and Founder of the Walk Free Foundation, said in a statement. ""The first step in eradicating slavery is to measure it. And with that critical information, we must all come together -- governments, businesses and civil society -- to finally bring an end to the most severe form of exploitation."" Highest percentages . While some of the world's most populous nations were home to the bulk of the incidences of modern slavery, other countries had higher percentages of their populations enslaved. The West African nation of Mauritania, the report found, had the highest prevalence, with an estimated 4% of its population in bondage. Other offenders include Uzbekistan (3.97%), Haiti (2.3%) and Qatar (1.35%). The Emirate, which will play host to the World Cup in 2022, has faced numerous questions concerning its labor laws and the kafala sponsorship system, which limits foreign workers' rights of movement. ""Qatar hosts significant numbers of foreign workers, and has risen in the ranking due to improved survey data, giving better insight into the high number of enslaved migrant workers in the nation,"" Gina Dafalia, the foundation's policy and research manager, told CNN. ""It is ranked fourth with an estimated 1.4% of the population in modern slavery. We consider this to be a conservative estimate."" Qatar has promised to address criticisms and expects to make announcements concerning repeal of the kafala system in early 2015. Refugees most vulnerable to slavery . Kevin Bales, lead author of the report, told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout that vulnerability is a key factor in the prevalence of slavery in a country, and that refugees are particularly susceptible to modern enslavement. ""It's not a surprise that many of the countries where we see large proportions of the population in slavery are also those countries that are beset by conflict, like Syria, and by other economic and environmental problems,"" he said. The International Labor Organization (ILO estimates that forced labor generates more than $150 billion in illicit profits every year, making it the second largest source of profits for international organized crimes behind the drugs trade. Bright spots . Iceland and Luxembourg, the report finds, have less than 100 people each living in slavery, the lowest number both in prevalence and in absolute numbers. While it acknowledges the efforts made by some countries, such as the Netherlands, Sweden, the U.S. and Australia to tackle the global issue, the report also reprimands some rich countries for not doing more. Hong Kong, Singapore and Brunei, along with Qatar and Kuwait are singled out for mention. The Walk Free Foundation, a global human rights organization with a mission to end modern slavery in a generation, was founded by Australian philanthropists, Andrew and Nicola Forrest.","The Global Slavery Index 2014 report finds that globally, almost 36 million people are subject to modern slavery .

"The apocryphal and numerically fluctuating line about the Velvet Underground, often attributed to Brian Eno, is that just 3,000 people bought ""The Velvet Underground and Nico,"" but every one of them formed a band. It wasn't true -- the 1967 album sold more than 50,000 copies in its first two years of release -- but the influence of the album is inescapable. The Velvets were precursors to punk rock, art rock, avant-garde rock, almost any kind of rock that veered from the status quo. And, not to discount the contributions of John Cale, Sterling Morrison, Maureen Tucker and the soon-to-depart Nico, but the voice of the band was Lou Reed. The singer, guitarist and songwriter died Sunday, according to his publicist. He had undergone a liver transplant in May. The Velvet Underground brought a thrilling dose of downtown noise and crudeness to a rock scene that was beginning to take its love-and-peace feelings all too seriously. Reed's songs, such as ""Waiting for the Man"" (whose narrator traveled to Harlem to meet his dealer), ""Venus in Furs"" (about a sadomasochistic relationship) and ""Heroin"" (self-explanatory), were journeys into humanity's dark side. Reed wrote or co-wrote every song on that first album and expanded his songwriting expertise on the VU's later works: the even rawer ""White Light/White Heat"" (1968); the quiet, sometimes brooding, occasionally ecstatic ""The Velvet Underground"" (1969); the pop-directed ""Loaded"" (1970); and the wide-ranging ""lost album"" ""VU,"" which was released in 1985. That was 15 years after the band broke up. The Velvets would later reunite for a 1993 tour and, after guitarist Sterling Morrison's passing, their 1996 introduction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Reed's songs were generally minimalist, sometimes self-consciously poetic, and usually delivered with a deadpan vocal that was all the more haunting, given the songs' subject matter. ""Heroin will be the death of me,"" he sang on ""Heroin,"" and then added, ""It's my wife / and it's my life,"" followed by a chuckle so chilling it sounded like giving up. Combined with the squeal of Cale's viola and the undertow of Tucker's percussion, it was like peering down a dark alley. But Reed was nothing if not a student of pop as well. He'd spent a couple pre-Velvet years slaving away at low-budget Pickwick Records learning the trade, and in his two-, three- and four-chord songs were undergirded with craftsmanship. Four chords may have been a bit much, anyway: ""One chord is fine. Two chords is pushing it. Three chords, and you're into jazz,"" he once said. ""Sunday Morning,"" from the ""Velvet Underground and Nico"" album, contrasted a gorgeous melody with warnings about the past. ""Jesus,"" from ""The Velvet Underground,"" had the purity of a prayer. And then there were ""Loaded's"" ""Sweet Jane"" and ""Rock and Roll,"" which -- in a more just universe -- would have been smash hits: the former a celebration of music, the latter a tribute to rock 'n' radio. His post-Velvets solo career was no less unpredictable. Befriended by David Bowie -- who acknowledged the VU's influence on his soundalike 1971 song ""Queen Bitch"" -- Reed created ""Transformer,"" a 1972 LP that featured his only Top 40 hit, ""Walk on the Wild Side."" One of the more unlikely hit singles of the pre-MTV era, the song featured unmistakable references to drag queens and oral sex, not to mention a jazzy saxophone solo from Bowie himself (who also produced the record). But Reed would never be pigeonholed. Three years later, he put out ""Metal Machine Music,"" described by ""The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll"" as ""four sides of grating instrumental noise"" and by rock critic (and frequent Reed sparring partner) Lester Bangs as ""the greatest album ever made."" Bangs was being sarcastic -- mostly -- but even his criticisms highlight the punk pleasure of ticking off authority figures: ""All landlords ... deserve whatever they get, and 'MMM' is the all-time guaranteed lease breaker. Every tenant in America should own a copy of this album,"" he wrote. Outsiders often become insiders, and that was no less true for Reed. By the '80s, indie bands were singling him out as a hero. His poker-faced demeanor became a TV mainstay on Honda scooter commercials. He demanded his MTV. He even got airplay for his new music, such as ""I Love You, Suzanne,"" from his 1984 album ""New Sensations."" He also showed a more open sense of humor, something that often ran underneath his compositions, even at their bleakest. The humor was most obvious in his occasional acting roles. He played a slick record producer in Paul Simon's 1980 film ""One Trick Pony,"" and a Bob Dylan parody named Auden in the underrated 1983 comedy ""Get Crazy,"" turning idle dialogue (""It's a deathbed request"") into instant songs. In recent decades, he had settled down with composer Laurie Anderson and become more reflective. With Cale, he paid tribute to Velvet Underground patron Andy Warhol with ""Songs for Drella"" (1990). His 1992 album ""Magic and Loss"" looked at life and aging. It was all part of existence, just like heroin and pale blue eyes and new ages and street hassles. ""I'm a realist. That's why I listen to Lou Reed,"" Bangs wrote in 1980. But for all the darkness and light of his lyrics, the music was often the ticket to raw excitement. That's why, even if all those people didn't form bands like the legend insists, the songs of Lou Reed will always matter. He summed it up in four deceptively simple words from the exuberant ""Rock and Roll."" ""It was all right,"" he sang. ""It was all right."" Yes, it is.","Rock icon, artist and pop pioneer Lou Reed died Sunday .

"Rep. Steve King said he agrees that the Obama administration needs to change its response to hostage situations but doesn't think the United States should go down the route of negotiating or paying ransoms. ""If you negotiate, if you pay ransom, you're going to get more hostages taken. There will be more kidnappings,"" the Iowa Republican said Tuesday on CNN's ""New Day."" President Barack Obama ordered a review of how the United States handles overseas kidnappings of American citizens by terrorists, including how the families of captives are kept informed. The administration has not indicated a willingness to negotiate or pay sums of money in exchange for hostages, a practice some governments have used to win the release of captives by ISIS. Obama and other U.S. officials have denounced the practice, saying that money has helped the group grow stronger. Following the most recent killing American aid worker Peter Kassig, King said Tuesday there are other things the government could do to better its overall response. ""I do think though that they need to improve their coordination between the agencies and do other things possible to help get these hostages free,"" he told CNN's Chris Cuomo. ""I'm afraid this is not the last beheading we will see and we need to take a much more aggressive approach towards ISIS, and take them on in the Middle East."" The U.S. government has seen criticism by at least one family of one of the slain hostages, James Foley, whose parents said the administration needed to be more willing to negotiate with ISIS. Rep.

But...we do have to be as compassionate and as open and as accommodating to these families who find themselves in this incredibly tragic situation,"" he said, suggesting that having ""a single point of contact that can give real answers in real time"" to the families would be helpful.","President Barack Obama has ordered a review of American hostage protocol .

"The Commission of Inquiry (COI) on Human Rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) arose out of frustrations experienced by the United Nations human rights machinery in dealing with that country. The international community was confronted with many reports, both scholarly and reliable, and some informal, of grave human rights violations against the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). In January 2013, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navanethem Pillay, called for a fully-fledged international inquiry into serious crimes said to have been taking place in North Korea for decades. She stressed that the natural concern of the international community about the implications for peace and security of the reported possession by DPRK of nuclear weapons should not overshadow the deplorable human rights situation in the country. But an immediate challenge was presented to the COI by the non-cooperation with the human rights mandate-holders of DPRK. North Korean impasse . DPRK stated publicly that it would ""totally reject and disregard"" the resolution establishing the COI. It claimed that this was ""a product of political confrontation and conspiracy."" In this sense, DPRK confronted the United Nations human rights system with an impasse. It would not cooperate with Universal Periodic Review, a review of the human rights records of all U.N. member states.  It would not cooperate with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. It would not cooperate with the present Special Rapporteur or his predecessor. It would not cooperate with the COI. It wished to be left alone. But this was not acceptable because of the substantial and believable testimony and other information demonstrating grave crimes against humanity and other human rights violations on the part of DPRK, a member country of the United Nations.  In this particular case, the COI had access to satellite images which were available to it. Those images, addressed to the vicinity of the towns described by the witnesses, strongly confirmed the existence of large facilities, whose layout and appearance conformed to the descriptions given by witnesses before the COI. Crimes against humanity . Like documentary interviews of European Holocaust survivors, now commonly available in museums created following the World War II genocides, witness testimony given to the COI on DPRK was presented in a low key, matter of fact, generally logical, unemotional and chronological manner. Based upon the testimony and information received, the COI found that DPRK authorities had committed, and were continuing to commit, crimes against humanity in political prison camps; in the ordinary prison system; by targeting religious believers; by imposing starvation on large sections of the population; and by targeting persons, including persons from other countries, and through the course of state sponsored abductions and disappearances. The presentation of the COI report to the United Nations created a sensation. No report of a COI of the HRC had been so effective, I believe, in drawing attention to victims and to such a broad range of wrongs perpetrated against the civilian population of a member state of the United Nations to such a shocking degree over such a long period of time. Unlike earlier totalitarian states and oppressive conduct, the world cannot now lament, ""if only we had known..."" Now, the world does know.  And the question is whether the world will respond effectively and take the necessary action. Failures with DPRK . It was frequently said that the greatest danger to human rights in the case of DPRK was its possession of a reported 20 nuclear armed warheads and its current development of an arsenal of missile delivery systems that could threaten its neighbors and the global community. In these circumstances, was there a danger that the injection (including into the Security Council) of ""contestable questions"" of human rights, would simply divert attention from the highest security priority that the world faced? The strategy of non-criticism, attempted friendliness and deference was singularly unsuccessful in securing either the goal of peace, national reunification or human rights compliance. For example, the meetings in Pyongyang in September 2002 with Japan's prime minister at the time, Junichiro Koizumi, and in September 2000 with then-President Kim Dae-Jong of ROK, were not long-term substantive successes. In the case of the Japanese prime minister, a tiny number of abductees were returned with an acknowledgment of a state policy of abductions by the DPRK that was said to have been abandoned. However, when the bones of some of the Japanese abductees, said to have died in DPRK, were returned to Japan, they were found to have no DNA match to the families of the abductees. In some cases they were probably animal bones -- an affront to Japan and to the abductees' families. Negotiations with ROK actually coincided with the clandestine development of nuclear weapons at the very time of the promotion of the ""Sunshine Policy"" by President Kim. Whilst such strategies are sometimes rewarded by minor concessions, objectively such measures can only be assessed as ""crumbs"" when measured against the violations and international crimes reported by the COI. Action from ICC and Security Council? What is the bottom line? The Charter of the United Nations gives the five permanent members of the Security Council a veto that can prevent the passage of resolutions on substantive matters, which the proposed referral of DPRK to the ICC would undoubtedly be. The Russian Federation has links of tradition, sentiment and history with DPRK dating to Soviet times. China has political links and substantial trade and is now the principal economic supporter of DPRK. How in these circumstances can the COI seriously expect any real action to the taken by the Security Council? In the end, a veto might indeed prevent action being taken upon some of the central recommendations of the COI Report. However, the Russian Federation now has few economic or other contacts with DPRK. China must itself be deeply concerned, not only by the development of nuclear weapons on its doorstep but also by the dangers of an exodus of civilian populations seeking refuge in the neighboring areas of China. The execution of Jang Song-taek, the uncle by marriage of the Supreme Leader of DPRK in December 2013, reportedly an advocate of the ""China path"" for DPRK, must also be a source of concern for China. Both Russia and China have agreed to the adoption of resolutions on the nuclear weapons program in DPRK, and to the close monitoring of the sanctions imposed by the Security Council on DPRK. No guarantees . The COI cannot, of course, guarantee the adoption of a new Security Council resolution on human rights in DPRK.  Still less can it ensure one that refers the case of DPRK to the ICC. But that would be the correct, principled step for the United Nations system to take, based on the COI report. It would put human rights up front. It would assure accountability for crimes against humanity.  It would vindicate the international rule of law.  It would fulfill the ""Responsibility to Protect"" human rights, agreed by the U.N. General Assembly unanimously in 2005 as a duty of the international community where a given country fails to protect the human rights of its nationals. That, assuredly, is the case in DPRK today. The world has therefore reached a moment of truth over DPRK. The international community and people everywhere will be watching closely the United Nations' consideration of the COI report. I am hopeful that the outcome will be positive. The human rights of the people of DPRK demand it. The peace and security of the Korean peninsula and its region require it.","U.N.'s Commission of Inquiry (COI) had no cooperation from North Korea, writes Michael Kirby .

"(CNN) -- Buffalo, New York, is no stranger to cold weather, but Tuesday's lake-effect storm and its upwards of 6 feet of snow was staggering for the city. ""This storm is basically a knife that went right through the heart of Erie County,"" said Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz. ""I can't remember and I don't think anyone else can remember this much snow falling in this short a period."" At least four people were killed in the storm. One of the storm-related deaths was a vehicle accident, said Peter Anderson, a spokesman for the county executive. Three others were cardiac arrests as a result of shoveling, said Peter Anderson, a spokesman for the county executive. Some places have already seen more than 60 inches of snow. And there's more coming -- possibly more than 90 inches in some areas after another round of wintry weather hits at the end of the week. The equivalent of a year's worth of snow is going to pound some areas over a three-day period, Poloncarz said. ""This is a very, very serious situation. This is a very serious storm ... It's probably heavier than anything that we have seen in over 40 years, so it's going to take some time to dig out,"" Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown told reporters. While some parts of the city saw only a dusting of snow, South Buffalo was particularly hard hit. Authorities issued a ban blocking unnecessary travel there while crews try to clear the roads. The snow left people stranded in cars, turned roadways into parking lots and forced some emergency responders to rely on snowmobiles provided by volunteers. It blanketed the area at a rate of 3 to 5 inches an hour. About 20 people were seeking shelter inside a fire station and 20 people were inside a police station Tuesday night, authorities said. A baby girl was delivered at the fire station Tuesday when an ambulance was unable to take her mother to the hospital, Buffalo Fire Commissioner Garnell Whitfield said. ""She was born, she's safe and she's healthy,"" Whitfield said. Others stranded in the snow faced devastating consequences. An 81-year-old man who went into cardiac arrest in the Buffalo suburb of Cheektowaga died after emergency personnel were unable to get him to a hospital, CNN affiliate WKBW reported. Firefighters reached the man about 8:30 a.m. Tuesday, the station reported. An ambulance couldn't reach the home, and a front loader that attempted to reach his home was stranded in the snow. The firefighters stayed with the man for four hours until a military truck could tow a vehicle carrying the man to the fire hall but he died, according to WKBW. Buffalo was not alone. Every state in the Union had a place somewhere within its borders registering temperatures below freezing Tuesday morning. That included Hawaii, where the temperature at Mauna Kea on the Big Island dropped to 31 degrees. In Florida, it was in the upper 20s in the Panhandle and freeze warnings were in effect. And it's not over: Another surge of cold air is likely by Wednesday to Thursday in the Midwest and Northeast. The Southeast could see record lows Wednesday morning as temperatures drop into the teens and 20s. The cause of this mayhem: Arctic air pouring over the relatively warm Great Lakes waters is producing extreme lake-effect snows. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers calls it thunder snow. ""The steam from the lake ... (is) still much warmer than the air,"" he said. ""The air is in the teens and the water in the 40s. That steam comes up and wants to rise. That rise ... creates a thunder storm but it's so cold it doesn't rain. It just snows."" Tuesday was the coldest November morning since 1976, according to meteorologist Ryan Maue of WeatherBELL Analytics. The average overnight low for the Lower 48 states was 19.4 degrees, Maue said. This is highly unusual for this time of year and is much more reminiscent of a pattern forecasters would expect to see in January or February, not November. Snow totals could approach 70 inches south of Buffalo -- almost 6 feet of snow. Lancaster, New York, has already received over 40 inches of snow, and it continues to snow at 4 to 5 inches per hour. Some areas in Erie County, Pennsylvania, have already seen 3 feet of snow. Thunder and lightning have been reported. Poloncarz Tuesday issued a state of emergency for the county, including a travel ban for all areas of the city of Buffalo south of Genesee Street, and 19 for municipalities. Only emergency vehicles are allowed to travel. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo deployed the National Guard to help bring in motorized equipment that can be used for snow-clearing, and tow trucks. Some roadways already had turned into parking lots of abandoned vehicles and stranded motorists, WKBW reported. Many communities had 3 to 4 feet of snow dropped on them during the 15-hour storm, with emergency vehicles and plows stuck in the snow, the station reported. A bus carrying 24 members of the Niagara University Women's Basketball team returning home from a game in Pittsburgh was stuck on a highway because of the snow. In an interview via Skype with CNN's Don Lemon Tuesday night, team members said they'd been stranded for 24 hours. ""The roads weren't plowed. It got really bad really fast. I'm assuming that somebody in the front of the line got stuck and everybody else had to stop, and that's how we got where we are,"" head coach Kendra Faustin said. For hours, she said, the snow was coming down so hard that they couldn't see anything surrounding the bus. Now, Faustin estimates there are more than 100 cars trapped on the highway behind them. They're running short on food and water and still waiting for rescuers, she said. ""It seems to be getting better, is what we're hoping,"" she said, ""but more importantly we're just hoping to get on the move."" Team members described their predicament throughout the day on Twitter. One post from the team's assistant coach showed police approaching the stranded bus on a snowmobile. To make matters worse, this is only the first band of heavy snow in the Buffalo region. More snow is expected on Wednesday, and then the lake-effect snow bands set up again for Wednesday night into Thursday with very heavy snow likely again. This could rank high in the history of lake-effect snow events. Over half the country -- 50.2% -- had snow on the ground Tuesday morning, according to the National Weather Service. Cuomo also announced that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the nation's largest public transit system, has activated NYC Transit's 2014-2015 winter operations plan in anticipation of the snow season. The plan includes new snow-fighting equipment for the department's buses, new improved cold-weather and communications equipment, and increased planning and collaboration with the Department of Sanitation, Cuomo said in a statement. CNN's Daniel Verello, Kevin Dotson, Chuck Johnston, Martin Savidge and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: Stranded basketball team's coach: ""It got really bad really fast""

"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN) -- West Florissant Avenue runs parallel to South Florissant Road, separated by several blocks. But the division runs much deeper. The two thoroughfares tell the story of two cities in one, of the gulf between class and race. Some white residents told me they lived in a bubble: They own homes off South Florissant Road, eat in restaurants there and rarely venture into the streets that were familiar to Michael Brown, the black teenager who was shot and killed by white police Officer Darren Wilson on August 9. Black residents who live in the patchwork of homes and apartments off West Florissant Avenue sounded a similar note. They, too, lived detached from other parts of Ferguson. On Monday, I walked both these Ferguson streets that have been unwittingly thrust into the news. I wanted to get a sense of the place, the people and the mood before a grand jury decides whether to indict Wilson. I also wanted to capture the contrast. South Florissant went through a revival, though signs of a city in decline still exist in the form of shuttered storefronts. There's an upscale wine bar, bicycle shop, a brew house and a plaza for concerts. It's walkable -- hence the district's name, Citywalk -- and quaint. It's a huge source of pride for Ferguson. But after Brown's death, business owners on South Florissant have suffered. Not as much as those on West Florissant Avenue, but they have lost money and are now fearful of what might happen after a grand jury decision is made public. Complete coverage on Ferguson . Scroll through my Instagram photos below to see the people and places of Ferguson. First, South Florissant Road: . West Florissant Avenue . West Florissant intersects with Canfield Drive, where Michael Brown was killed. A memorial was erected where his body lay on the street for four hours. West Florissant has been declining for many years, a victim of white flight from the area. The St. Louis Great Streets Initiative was already looking into revamping West Florissant's commercial area and said in a study that it was not pedestrian-friendly or diverse. Unlike South Florissant Road, there are no upscale restaurants here. There's a McDonald's and Chinese fast food. There's also a barbecue place that was very badly hit because of its location next to the QuikTrip gas station, which became ground zero for violent protests and was burned down. Police armed with tear gas confronted protesters on West Florissant in August. In the weeks since, many businesses had removed the plywood boards covering their doors and windows, but now they are back up again in expectation of more unrest. One place that has never been boarded up is the Ferguson Burger Bar & More. Owner Charles Davis puts his faith in God and in the community.

"Why was a Colombian army general traveling deep in rebel territory, out of uniform and without bodyguards? That country's largest guerrilla group Tuesday confirmed capturing Gen. RubÃ©n DarÃ­o Alzate. The announcement came during a news conference in Havana, where guerrillas and Colombian government officials have been holding peace talks. Both Colombian government officials and rebel leaders said they did not know what Alzate was doing in a remote area of western Colombia when guerrillas captured him over the weekend. Colombian media reported he was the highest-ranking officer to be taken prisoner during the country's blood, five-decades-old civil war. Alzate commands a 2,500-soldier counterinsurgency group and previously headed the army's anti-kidnapping unit. Leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC, said they gained a valuable prize by taking Alzate prisoner. ""We are talking about a general who is one of the most important generals to their concept of counter-insurgency,"" the FARC leader known as Pablo Catatumbo said at the news conference Tuesday. On Monday, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos suspended the peace talks and demanded that FARC release Alzate immediately. Santos also called on the country's military to investigate why Alzate had apparently broken protocol by venturing into rebel territory. According to Colombian government officials, Alzate was traveling by a boat along a river in an area known to be a hub for drug smugglers and rebels when he, an Army lawyer and a corporal were captured. A second soldier traveling with the group managed to escape and told officials that Alzate and his companions had been in the area to inspect an energy project. But on Tuesday, FARC leaders said no such project exists in that area and that they were also baffled what Alzate's presence there. FARC leaders would not say whether they would free Alzate so that the peace talks could continue. ""We are willing to find a prompt, calm and just solution to this problem,"" said Catatumbo. The U.S. government has provided Colombia's military with billions of dollars in training and aid to battle FARC guerrillas, who authorities accuse of massive-scale drug trafficking to finance their insurgency. At the beginning of the peace talks in 2012, FARC leaders said they had released all their prisoners and hostages as a sign of good faith. But President Santos has resisted their offers of a ceasefire, saying a previous armistice allowed rebels to seize large swathes of territory.","Gen.

"Arrest warrants have been issued for two Americans accused of stealing adult and infant body parts from a museum inside a Thai hospital and trying to ship them to Las Vegas. But the two men have already left Thailand despite being interviewed by police. The Americans, Ryan Edward McPherson and Daniel Jamon Tanner, told police they wanted to surprise their friends back home, Royal Thai Police Deputy Commissioner Gen. Ruangsak Jritake said Monday. It's unclear whether McPherson or Tanner have attorneys. So far, they have not able to be reached for comment. A delivery company uncovered the macabre shipment. On Saturday, a DHL office in Thailand's Pathum Thani province called police after workers there were scanning shipments and discovered the body parts inside three packages. The packages contained five acrylic plastic boxes, Ruangsak said. One box contained an infant's head; another contained a baby's left foot, which was sliced into three pieces, the police official said. The other acrylic boxes contained an adult heart and adult skin. Flea market claim . Over the weekend, police said they had talked to an American who was trying to send the parcels to the United States but couldn't bring any charges against him because they weren't sure what laws applied to the case. At the time, police said the American told them he found the infant body parts at a night flea market and that he had paid about $100 for them -- though he could not remember where the market was located. But on Monday, authorities revealed more details on the case. All the body parts were stolen from the Siriraj Medical Museum within Bangkok's Siriraj Hospital, the largest hospital in Thailand, Ruangsak said. The body parts were taken from the forensic medicine museum and anatomical museum. Police said closed-circuit video from the hospital showed two men identified as McPherson and Tanner. ""The two foreigners definitely visited our museum, but we cannot see from the CCTV camera that they stole those items,"" said Udom Kachintorn, dean of the hospital's faculty of medicine. ""It is evidence that confirms the two foreigners are linked to the missing items."" Police said they were also investigating whether museum employees or other local people were involved in the theft. Arrest warrants issued . A Thai criminal court approved arrest warrants for the two men on charges of theft from a government hospital, as well as breaching customs law, police said Tuesday. If convicted, McPherson and Tanner could face up to seven years in prison or a fine of up to 500,000 Thai baht ($15,200). But the Americans have already left Thailand for Cambodia. Thai police said they would send the arrest warrants to the Bangkok office of Interpol, the international police agency, to try to trace the men. They also said they were in touch with Cambodian police directly and had asked the FBI, through the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, to gather information on the packages' destinations. Officials at the U.S. embassies in Thailand and Cambodia said they were aware of reports about the case but couldn't comment, citing privacy concerns. Black market for body parts . The bizarre discovery is not the first time infant remains have been found in Thailand. In 2010, more than 2,000 illegally aborted fetuses were recovered at a Buddhist temple in Bangkok. Infant body parts can be bought on the Thai black market. Some Thais practice black magic and believe that supernatural power comes from infant body parts, if the rites are performed by monks or sorcerers. They believe that having the items provides protection and business success and can ward off bad luck. In 2010, police said the smell of decay led investigators to the Phai-nguern Chotinaram temple in central Bangkok, where they discovered more than 2,000 illegally aborted fetuses. Three people were arrested, including two morticians who were charged with hiding bodies. According to the hospital museum website, for 120 years, ""Siriraj Hospital has collectively gathered an enormous compilation of medical equipments and tools, anatomical and clinical specimens including important artifacts and archives relating to the history of medicine in Thailand.""","If convicted, the two Americans could face 7 years in prison or be fined $15,200 .

"(CNN)Deep in the untouched areas of Ukraine and Russia live men who have decided to leave human establishments and live isolated in nature.

If they fall ill, Tkachenko said, they live with the condition or treat themselves with folk methods. He said one man lost his vision completely but continues to live by himself in the woods. Occasionally the men see tourists, hunters or guests like Tkachenko, though typically they are alone. ""Communication with people has been broken off and left in the past,"" he said.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Embattled Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has authorized his vice president to negotiate a transfer of power with opposition parties, the state-run Saba News Agency reported Monday. Vice President Abd Rabo Mansou Hadi has ""the constitutional authority to conduct a dialogue with the signatories of the initiative made by the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council for the Arab Gulf States,"" Saleh said in a presidential decree published by Saba. The president, who has been in Saudi Arabia recuperating from a bomb attack for more than three months, said he was acting ""to reach a political solution to the current political crisis and in order to preserve Yemen's unity, security and stability."" The decree gives Hadi authority to sign the proposal, which would result in early presidential elections intended to ensure a peaceful transfer of power. The move, however, was not welcomed by opposition parties.  Those groups have ignored Saleh's call for dialogue and urged the nation's youths to peacefully escalate their pressure on the regime until it falls. Mohammed Qahtan, spokesman for the opposition coalition group, Joint Meeting Parties, called on the young people not to comply with the regime's tactics, which he said are intended to weaken their position. ""Any call for dialogue before Saleh signs the GCC proposal comes in an effort by the regime to stall more time for Saleh in power,"" Qahtan said. He added, ""The Yemeni revolution will continue to go forward."" The JMP announced last week that the GCC proposal was no longer an option, since Saleh had had his chance to sign it but refused. ""The GCC proposal was on the table for Saleh to sign months ago,"" said Mohammed Basendowah, the president of the opposition national council. Sultan Barakani, the head of ruling party bloc in parliament, said that the ruling General People's Congress is sticking with the GCC power transfer proposal. ""Opposition forces are not keeping their word and are not willing to come to the dialogue table. We call them to dialogue but they insist on having the crisis continue,"" Barakani said. The GCC proposal is for Saleh to transfer his executive powers to Hadi within 30 days. Saleh would then formally resign. In exchange, Saleh, his family members and close aides would be granted immunity against all potential prosecution. The proposal was put forward in May by the six nations on the Arabian Peninsula that make up the council. Saleh had initially indicated he would go along with it, but then refused to sign. A Yemeni government official briefed on the negotiations but not authorized to speak to the news media said the decree has been in the works for the past week and is not a stalling tactic. ""The entire leadership of the ruling party were working together on this, but pressure was also coming from the GCC, the U.S., the EU and the U.N. envoy to come up with a solution to the political impasse in Yemen,"" the official said. ""This is definitely Saleh saying to the vice president: You negotiate, you sign, and with regional and international supervision, we'll hold early elections.  These are clear one, two, three steps. It's not just Saleh saying to negotiate -- that would be stalling."" He said the decree makes it appear that Saleh plans to finish his medical treatment abroad. Protests demanding Saleh's ouster have been going on for eight months. The General People's Congress has been continuously urging dialogue. Journalist Hakim Almasmari and CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","The opposition coalition group's spokesman calls the move a stalling tactic .

"(CNN) -- Back in 2010, one of us -- Isabel -- was faced with the question of whether to shake the President's hand. And, despite having been invited to the White House, he decided not to. Why? Because the families and communities of 11 million U.S. residents were still waiting years for President Obama to fulfill his promise of immigration reform. And they are still waiting, and have been left feeling betrayed by the failure of this administration to act. The meeting to discuss U.S. immigration policy in 2010 followed what was dubbed the ""Trail of Dreams"" walk by four immigrant college students, including Sousa-Rodriguez, from Miami to Washington to call attention to the plight of the undocumented in the United States. The 1,500 mile walk took place as the number of deportations was hitting historic highs, numbers that have resulted in some 2 million immigrants being deported. Why are we still waiting for change? The recent election results are sufficient proof of the folly of the Obama administration's approach. After all, the Congressional Budget Office determined in June 2013 that immigration reform would boost economic output and could help cut federal budget deficits by $197 billion over the next 10 years. But just as important as the lost economic benefits of the failure to act is the human cost. In our ongoing research on undocumented youth and their mothers living in Florida, we find harrowing patterns of fear, exploitation and dehumanization. Denying opportunities for lawful status results in barriers to employment, physical and social mobility, education and health, and the lack of opportunities has a particularly troubling impact on immigrants' mental and emotional well-being. True, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, has helped those young adults who are eligible. But our research suggests their families need relief from deportation, too, and cannot afford to continue waiting for the President to deliver on his promises. The reality is that every single day there is a human cost: separated families, deteriorating health, childhood trauma and economic insecurity. These human costs in turn have ripple effects that chip away at the enormous contributions that immigrants make to our economy and communities. Take the case of ""Bobby,"" an 18-year-old immigrant who arrived in the United States with his parents from Peru when he was 2. In spite of DACA, which granted Bobby and other young people like him a temporary work permit and driver's license, the benefits of this program did not extend to his undocumented mother battling breast cancer, nor his father who was unable to find employment that would afford him health benefits. Bobby recently shared with us that at the end of last month, ineligible for health insurance and unable to afford the medical attention she needed and deserved, his mother passed away. ""We live in a world so spiteful some of us could fall off and no one would notice,"" Bobby had told us before his mother died. We send our condolences to Bobby's family and loved ones. But sadly, his is not an isolated case; communities across the nation are losing people every day, not just through government inaction, but through policies that are actively separating families through detention and deportation, despite the many positive contributions immigrants are making to U.S. society. It is long past time for the President to take unambiguous action to prevent further harm to immigrants and their families -- harm that can be easily avoided by providing them with legal status. What does this mean in practical terms? For a start, the President should implement broad and inclusive administrative relief from deportation to parents of DACA recipients and other hardworking immigrants who are contributing to our economy and communities. This is the only way to ensure that families like Bobby's do not continue paying the price for the failure of Congress to pass meaningful immigration reform when they had the opportunity. Providing legal status to hardworking immigrants could have allowed Bobby's father to attain a job with health benefits that could have saved Bobby's mother's life. And while the President cannot bring Bobby's mother back, it is not too late to help millions of other immigrants and U.S. citizens who are fighting every day to keep their families together and their communities safe. America needs broad-based action on immigration reform. It is not just the right thing to do economically -- it will also save lives.","11 million waiting on immigration reform, say Elizabeth Aranda, Isabel Sousa-Rodriguez .

"As Ebola fades from the headlines, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other top federal health officials made their case for a multi-billion dollar emergency fund to fight the virus in a congressional hearing Tuesday. CDC director Thomas Frieden defended President Barack Obama's $6.2 billion proposal to combat Ebola, pointing out that the CDC is working on ""borrowed dollars."" ""The only way to protect us in the U.S. is to stop it at the source, and to build systems both in Africa and the U.S. that will find, stop and prevent Ebola,"" said Frieden, likening the spread of Ebola virus to a wild fire. Band Aid's Geldof on Ebola: 'We're going to stop this thing' If secured, the funding will be spent in part on increased foreign aid to halt the spread of Ebola in West Africa. Another portion of the money could build new safeguards to help American hospitals respond swiftly to potential future outbreaks. Currently, not all American medical centers are equipped to treat Ebola. With more funding, officials, say, hospital training can be expanded beyond the four medical centers where patients are funneled. CDC director reflects on how his agency is handling Ebola . Obama made his pitch for increased funding just before a meeting with top health officials earlier Tuesday. In his remarks, the President admitted that media attention over the crisis has ebbed in recent weeks as the number of American Ebola patients has decreased -- but insisted that future risks can be minimized if Congress acts now. ""We are nowhere near out of the woods yet in West Africa,"" Obama said, noting the increasing number of Ebola contractions in Sierra Leone. ""The more we can catch these things early where they begin, the less risks we have over the long term."" Should cities be reimbursed for Ebola costs? The second death from Ebola in the U.S. occurred this week: Martin Salia, a doctor who contracted the disease when treating patients in Sierra Leone, died Monday in Nebraska. For additional funding to be secured, Congress will need to pass a new budget by Dec. 11 before the GOP Senate majority is sworn in -- or risk a government shutdown.

"(CNN) -- When Billy Nungesser appears on the news, sweat-soaked and breathless, railing against BP and the government for failing to keep the oil in the Gulf of Mexico from reaching Louisiana's shores, the anguish on the politician's face is real. ""He takes this personally because he feels a great responsibility for the lives and livelihoods of the people of Plaquemines Parish,"" said Benny Puckett, a parish employee who works for Nungesser. ""When he says things that some people take as controversial, he doesn't mean to be controversial; he's just speaking from his heart."" Among his more provocative statements: that the leadership of the Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers should be fired, that their plan of attack has been an ""embarrassment."" ""They had no plan to keep the oil out, even though they said it wouldn't come ashore. They had no plan to clean it up. They had no plan to make the fishermen whole. It's like it's being run with a bunch of seventh-graders,"" the outspoken freshman parish president said last week. ""This is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable."" Nungesser, president of Louisiana's southernmost parish, where the Mississippi River meets the Gulf, spoke with President Obama on Friday about how to minimize the spill's impact on a community whose livelihood depends on fishing and offshore oil industries. Nungesser has said he is confident in the president's assurance that something would be done to protect the barrier islands, which come more than a month after the politician began sounding the alarm bell over the spill's potential impact on Plaquemines' extensive network of marshes and waterways. Nungesser hopes berms can be built to protect the area from the oil, and the Coast Guard was part of a discussion on the idea Tuesday. ""[President Obama] has the opportunity ... to do the right thing on these berms,"" Nungesser said in a phone interview Tuesday night. ""If the truth gets back to him on these berms, I'm confident he'll do the right thing."" Since the early days of the massive oil spill, the Louisiana native has been going non-stop, according to friends and family, waking up around 3 a.m. and returning home at 11 p.m., after a full day of meetings, tours of the area and rounds on local and national news networks. ""I worry about him. I'm concerned about him dropping dead on me because he never stops,"" said friend Leo Polazzo, who has known Nungesser since his days as a local businessman. ""I talk to his fiancÃ©e to find out about him, because I can't talk to him because he's so busy."" Nungesser says his energy comes from wanting ""to do the right thing."" ""Dad always told me I had one speed: always wide open,"" he said. ""I can't rest as long as the job still needs to be done."" His outspokenness comes as no surprise to those who know him. Before Nungesser became the weary face representing Louisiana's coastal communities, he was already known among friends and constituents as someone who'd do anything to help others, who'd open his home to strangers and stray animals alike. Like most Gulf Coast natives, his backstory is tied to the industries that have sustained the region. He grew up in Algiers, outside of New Orleans, working in his father's cannery before starting his own business ventures. He was the second of four children and was known as the class clown who could never stay still and often brought home stray animals much to his parents' chagrin, his sister, Heidi Nungesser Landry, said. ""Billy never sat down for a meal. He probably had [attention deficit disorder], but they didn't diagnose it in those days. Our father would tell him to sit in the corner, and he could not stand still,"" she said. After high school, he attended LSU and Holy Cross but didn't graduate, she said. Inspired by his father, William Nungesser Sr., a local businessman and chairman of the state Republican Party, she said the younger Nungesser made an unsuccessful run for state representative and served on the state levee board in the 1980s. Soon after he began working for his father's business, which had evolved into a catering company for the offshore industry, providing cooks and food on oil rigs. During trips out to check on operations or fill in for someone who called in sick, Nungesser became aware of living conditions on the rig and came up with an idea for his own business: converting old shipping containers into living quarters. General Marine Leasing proved to be a great success, mostly due to Nungesser's finesse with clients, said Rene Cross, a contractor who became a friend of Nungesser's after working with him. ""He made it a priority to keep in touch with his clients and to listen to them. If they wanted modifications or a Jacuzzi, he'd find a way to do it,"" he said. ""He's brilliant. He's an idea man. He has a million ideas, and he is determined to make them all work."" By the time a Canadian company offered to buy General Marine Leasing from him for a reported $18 million, Nungesser had moved to Plaquemines Parish, bought property on a low level of land and turned his sights to raising elk. He acquired more than 100 head in Nebraska and corralled them in an area of his property, but could never bring himself to kill them, Cross said. ""He treated them all like they were his kids, like puppy dogs,"" he said. ""I think he sent a few to the butcher, but you can also use their horns for vitamin supplements, so he ended up making a profit by grinding up their horns."" Nungesser lost most of his herd when Hurricane Katrina roared through Plaquemines in 2005, carrying some of the elk up to 30 miles from his property, Cross said. Yet Nungesser eagerly participated in relief efforts, taking his airboat on rescue missions, opening his home to stranded people and abandoned animals, and helping to clear roads. On adjacent property, a riding facility that he built for handicapped children became a staging ground for relief efforts, where volunteers slept and supplies were stored, according to Puckett, who worked on Nungesser's property coordinating relief efforts. ""Billy is probably the most compassionate person that I've dealt with on a regular basis and that compassion has never waned. It stays there all the time,"" Puckett said. ""He was eager, at a moment's notice, to help out. He stepped up, and he never refused anybody that he could assist. He'd give you the shirt off his back and last dollar in pocket."" Nungesser says he ran for parish president in part because he didn't see the incumbent in the community during the Katrina clean-up. ""I saw absolutely no one standing up for the people of this parish,"" he said. ""People told me, 'You ought to run and quit complaining.' "" Since taking office in 2007, those who know him say he has cemented his reputation as a dedicated champion of the beleaguered community through a long list of accomplishments in a short period of time related to recovery efforts. ""I don't think Billy ever really relaxes. I can get him out on the boat or hunting, and he'll take it easy for a bit, but within 10 minutes, it's back to the business of Plaquemines Parish,"" said Cross. ""But he loves it. He takes great joy and pride in contributing to the improvement of the community."" Nungesser says he'll keeping working hard as long as the oil threatens his parish. ""Things still need to be done to keep the oil out. ... At the end of this thing, I have to know I did everything possible to save the parish and the coast land,"" Nungesser said. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Billy Nungesser warned of oil spill's potential impact on coastal communities early on .

"(CNN)  -- At least 510 people were killed in Caracas, Venezuela, in December, giving support to a recent report that called the city the murder capital of the world. A chalk message reads No More Murders as a student protests  killings in Caracas in this file photo. It's against that backdrop that the country's minister for Interior Relations and Justice announced efforts this week to combat crime in 2009. Minister Tareck El Aissami said Monday he will form 50 community police units in Caracas and take other measures so that ""we can have in a short time a culture of peace, tranquility and calm for all the Venezuelan public."" By all accounts, it will be a tall order. Foreign Policy magazine said in September that Caracas tops the list of five murder capitals of the world, with an official tally of 130 homicides per 100,000 residents. The city, which is Venezuela's capital, has about 4 million inhabitants. Foreign Policy is owned by The Washington Post Co. and published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The United States made the magazine's top five, too, with New Orleans, Louisiana coming in at No. 3. Its murder rate is estimated as 67 per 100,000 by its police department and 95 per 100,000 by the FBI. Still, the rate in Caracas comes in far ahead of the following four murderous capitals. ""Caracas has become far more dangerous in recent years than any South American city, even beating out the once notorious Bogota, [Colombia],"" Foreign Policy said. ""What's worse, the city's official homicide statistics likely fall short of the mark because they omit prison-related murders as well as deaths that the state never gets around to properly 'categorizing.' ""The numbers also don't count those who died while 'resisting arrest,' suggesting that Caracas' cops -- already known for their brutality against student protesters -- might be cooking the books,"" the magazine said. CNN affiliate Globovision TV reported this week that officials reported 510 killings in Caracas this month, capping a particularly brutal year. ""It's shocking,"" said Jennifer McCoy, director of The Americas Program at the Carter Center in Atlanta. ""It's the biggest concern of the population -- crime and security."" Federico Welsch, a political science professor at La Universidad de Simon Bolivar in Caracas for 25 years, has seen that crime up close. ""Violence is the major problem for Venezuelans, according to any source you use,"" Welsch told CNN on Tuesday. ""It's doubly sad because, primarily, the deaths occur almost exclusively in the poor sectors, and, secondarily, it's among youth under 30 years old."" McCoy points out that the killings are ""basically poor on poor."" From the 1970s to the 1990s, the poverty rate nearly tripled, from 25 percent to 65 percent, McCoy said. Even though the poverty rate declined during the oil boom that started in the 1990s, she said, the rate remains high. ""It's a combination of economic-driven crime ... with other types of gangs, to police abuse,"" McCoy said. ""The police are not properly trained and not properly equipped."" Anti-crime efforts in Caracas also suffered, she said, when the national government took over the city's police force in 2002. ""There has been trouble getting the police force back to par,"" she said. Welsch said he doubts the anti-crime measures El Aissami announced Monday will work. ""You can't resolve this problem with police,"" Welsch said. ""The government is co-responsible for there being so many firearms. There is no good gun control, there are no permits and there is no good control over the militias."" The problem, Welsch and McCoy said, transcends the drug trade and gang battles. ""You don't have the guerrilla problems,"" McCoy said. ""You don't have drug cartels. You don't have a large mafia."" Welsch lays much of the blame on the 10-year-old government of socialist President Hugo Chavez. ""The government discourse,"" he said, ""is that if you are lacking something it is because of injustice. Then look for it, take it away from those who have it. You can obtain justice with your own hands."" The magazine lists, in descending order, Caracas; Cape Town, South Africa; New Orleans; Moscow, Russia; and Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, as the top five murder capitals in the world.","Foreign Policy magazine names Caracas, Venezuela, the murder capital of the world .

"After nearly a year of unprecedented attention given to allegations of widespread abuse and torture within North Korea, one question is being repeatedly asked: When will the international community do anything about it? On Tuesday, a United Nations General Assembly committee is expected to consider a draft resolution on North Korea's human rights abuses. The vote is merely a recommendation, as the General Assembly does not have the power to refer the regime or its young leader Kim Jong Un to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity (ICC). That authority lies only with the U.N. Security Council, a 15-member body charged with maintaining global security. But the five permanent members at the core of the Security Council, including China and Russia, wield veto powers. China is likely to use its veto as its officials have repeatedly called efforts to send North Korea's leadership to the ICC as ""not helpful."" Here's a reminder of where we are so far. 1. What the draft resolution states . The draft resolution, which was presented by the European Union and Japan, contains strong language against North Korea and encourages others to push the country toward the ICC and issue ""targeted sanctions."" This follows the recommendations from a scathing U.N. Commission of Inquiry report on North Korea published earlier this year. ""We know the U.N. and nations of the world are much more galvanized than they were last year, or any other point in history, to address North Korea's systematic human rights abuses,"" said Sung-Yoon Lee, a professor of Korean studies at Tufts University. Murder, torture, slavery, sexual violence, mass starvation -- North Korea's leaders have been accused of employing all sorts of abuses to prop up the isolated regime and exercise total control over its citizens. 2. North Korea denies, denounces . North Korea has repeatedly denied the existence of human rights atrocities, denouncing the credibility of those who testified in the Commission of Inquiry. It has repeatedly claimed that the United States and its allies are seeking to discredit and overthrow the leadership in North Korea. 3. Does the GA vote even matter? Since the power lies with the Security Council -- and China is likely to veto any attempts to refer North Korea to the international court -- what's the significance of the vote? ""Even from a strictly utilitarian viewpoint, a U.N. vote would likely make a positive difference,"" Lee said. ""The international community would be better positioned to further build its case against the DPRK."" While Lee said that North Korea's leadership is probably not rattled, it is ""sensitive to the growing criticism."" And such ""sustained pressure"" is much more effective than ""indifference or moral persuasion alone,"" he said. 4. The China veto . Throughout the year, Chinese officials have reiterated that submitting human rights cases to the ICC ""won't help improve a country's human rights condition."" North Korea's longtime ally has never wavered in its support for Pyongyang -- even during bumps in their relationship. In May, Russia and China vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution that would have asked the International Criminal Court to investigate war crimes in Syria. They were the only two of 15 countries to vote against the resolution. If China has to use its veto powers to defend North Korea against the collective international will, there are effects, said Lee. ""High-profile actions at the U.N. that pit China and the DPRK on one side against the 'civilized' nations of the world on the other have implications on how states and multinational corporations conduct trade and business with the DPRK,"" he said. ""Divestiture was a powerful tool the world used against South Africa's apartheid regime. Likewise, deterring European states and companies from selling North Korea luxury goods in violation of several UNSC resolutions can only put pressure on the Kim regime."" 5. What the U.S. wants . The U.S. backs the resolution to sanction and refer North Korea to the ICC. Despite the gesture made by North Korea last week to release the last remaining two Americans -- Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller -- detained in the country, it has not altered the United State's stance on the country's human rights. ""Nothing has changed about our concerns about North Korea's human record -- abysmal human rights record,"" said Jen Psaki, U.S. State Department spokeswoman. ""Those issues remain ones that we will continue to work with the international community on.""","U.N. General Assembly committee considers resolution on North Korean human rights .
Security Council has the power to refer to the International Criminal Court .
China does not support referring North Korea to the ICC for human rights abuses .

"A large crowd of mourners gathered in Jerusalem on Tuesday just hours after four Israeli worshipers -- all of whom held either dual U.S. or British citizenship -- were killed by Palestinians wielding butcher knives and a gun, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told CNN. Hours after the attack, a policeman shot during the rampage while pulling a woman to safety died from his wounds, said Racheli Goldblatt, a spokeswoman at Hadassah hospital. At 7 a.m. local time, Moshe Twersky, 59; Aryeh Kupinsky, 43; Avraham Shmuel Goldberg, 68; and Kalman Levine, 55, were praying in a synagogue in the Har Nof neighborhood, an ultra-Orthodox community on the outskirts of Jerusalem where many people from Western nations live, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said. The Foreign Ministry said the assailants carried butcher knives and a gun. Kupinsky, Levine and Twerksy had dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship, the Jerusalem Post reported. They were slain while wearing prayer shawls, said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called for international condemnation of the violence and ordered the attackers' homes destroyed. Goldberg is a British-Israeli national, authorities said. He's from Liverpool, according to the Liverpool Echo and used to live in London's Golders Green neighborhood, which is known for its large Jewish population. Levine leaves behind nine children and five grandchildren, according to Shimon Kraft, a good friend. He was remembered as a sweet and kind person, someone who was great at making people laugh. ""I know he's in a great place. His priority in life was connecting to God,"" Kraft told CNN. ""He didn't waste a minute. He was so alive."" ""He was really someone who tried to bring people together no matter what their background was, and their approach to life or religion. Such a tragic irony that a person who loved his fellow human beings would meet a tragic end in such a horrible attack,"" said Alan Edelman, of the Jewish Federation of Greater Kansas City. The Israeli Foreign Ministry referred to the men as rabbis. Rabbi can mean someone who studies, learns or teaches Jewish scriptures or law. It can also mean a religious leader or someone who leads a congregation. A family's legacy . Twersky is originally from Boston, according to the newspaper, and his father was Isadore Twersky. The elder Twersky was an internationally renown rabbi and philosopher as well as a professor of Hebrew literature at Harvard University. When he died in 1997, the Harvard Crimson called him a pioneer of Jewish thought. Moshe Twersky's grandfather was Joseph B. Soloveitchik, who is considered a founding father of modern Orthodox philosophy. A New York Times obituary on Isadore Twersky says that Moshe Twersky had two brothers who were rabbis. Isadore Twersky formerly directed the Center for Jewish Studies at Harvard. ""I know that I speak for all of us in the CJS community when I say that we are heartbroken at the news of this unspeakable act of sacrilegious cruelty,'' Eric Nelson, the director of the center, told CNN. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the Twersky family at this terribly sad and difficult time."" Moshe Twersky graduated from Boston's Maimonides School in 1973, the school said in a statement, adding that ""the Maimonides School Family is engulfed in grief and outrage."" He had lived in Jerusalem for the past 30 years, the school said, and is survived by his wife, Bashy, their five children and many grandchildren. Kupinsky grew up in the Detroit suburb of Oak Park, the Detroit Free Press reported. The 43-year-old was a member of Young Israel of Oak Park, one of the largest Orthodox Jewish congregations in Michigan, and moved to Israel with his family when he was in elementary school, a boyhood friend, Michael Zwick, told the newspaper. ""It was a terrible thing to hear,"" Zwick said of the slayings. A city on edge . Rosenfeld said that police responded shortly after the attack began and shot and killed the attackers, two cousins from East Jerusalem. Tuesday's violence is the deadliest attack in Jerusalem since a man with an automatic weapon killed eight seminary students in March 2008. But the city has been on edge lately after a series of stabbings and vehicles attacks. Netanyahu's office called the attack ""the direct result of incitement being led by Hamas"" and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, referring first to the Palestinian group that controls Gaza and next to the Fatah movement leader in control of the West Bank. Abbas condemned the synagogue bloodshed, WAFA reported, while stressing the need to end the causes of such attacks such as tensions over what Jews call the Temple Mount and Palestinians call al-Aqsa Mosque. Ma'an, a semi-official Palestinian news agency, identified the attackers as Ghassan Abu Jamal and his cousin Udayy. It's unclear whether their alleged actions were part of a coordinated campaign or spontaneous. 'Wonderful men ... slaughtered' The devastation felt from the slayings was evident among mourners at an eulogy for the four men. ""When four great men, wonderful men, wise in Torah study are slaughtered while praying in public, there is no public grieving greater than that,"" the man at a microphone said in Hebrew to the large crowd in the street. A camera captured young women wrapping their arms around each other and swaying. One buried her head in another's shoulder and wept. ""It was horrific,"" a man described as a witness to the slayings said in a Reuters video. ""I can't imagine such attacks would occur to our community. We have to take some time to walk out of the trauma."" At least seven people were also wounded in the attack, including three who were seriously hurt, authorities said. Obama condemns 'horrific' Jerusalem terror attack . Mark Regev, spokesman for Netanyahu, vowed that Israeli police presence will be increased. ""We've got to make sure there are no copycat attacks,"" he said on CNN's ""New Day."" ""We're going to be tough ... with the terrorists,"" Regev said. Netanyahu summoned top aides to a ""security consultation"" later Tuesday in Jerusalem, his office announced. U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro posted online that the ""terrorist attack ... represents a barbaric new low in the sad and outrageous history of such attacks. ""Murdering worshipers at prayer in a synagogue is an act if pure, unadulterated evil,"" he wrote. ""On behalf of the United States government and the American people, I condemn this terrorist attack in the strongest possible terms."" President Barack Obama said Tuesday that ""there is and can be no justification for such attacks against innocent civilians."" ""At this sensitive moment in Jerusalem,"" Obama continued, ""it is all the more important for Israeli and Palestinian leaders and ordinary citizens to work cooperatively together to lower tensions, reject violence and seek a path forward towards peace.""","A policeman wounded in the attack has died, a hospital spokeswoman says .

"Yasser Arafat is gone. Yet 10 years after his death, he's survived by the internal frustration and outward animosity that's long defined relations among and between Israelis and Palestinians. So, too, has the violence that's marred the region for decades. Recent incidents have stirred fears in Israel of a return to 2002, then in the midst of a second intifada, or armed uprising, when the Israeli government reported 452 people died in suicide bombings and other attacks. On one day alone last week, an Israeli soldier was stabbed to death on a Tel Aviv street while three Israelis were stabbed -- one fatally -- at the same West Bank hitchhiking post where three Israeli teens were kidnapped earlier this year. This followed several incidents in which drivers ran their vehicles into crowds on busy streets. Then came Tuesday, when two knife- and ax-wielding Palestinian cousins killed four Israelis worshiping inside a Jerusalem synagogue. 'Terror attack' at Jerusalem synagogue . So does this all mean a third intifada is coming, if it's not already here? No -- or, at least, not yet, according to experts. Much has changed, they point out, since Arafat's death. It's harder than ever to get from the West Bank into Israel, especially with explosives and such. There has been no call to arms by the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank; instead, analysts say, there has been significant cooperation with Israeli authorities to ferret out potential attackers. And there haven't been anything close yet to the coordinated, large-scale attacks in Israel like those of the early 2000s. As retired former Israeli National Security Adviser Maj. Gen. Yaakov Amidror pointed out last week, what's happening now ""falls far from"" the first two intifadas, as far as the overall threat to Israel. But one thing that hasn't changed is the deep frustration among Palestinians. Now, as was the case over a decade ago, many still harbor steep distrust of Israeli authorities and diminishing hopes for a political breakthrough. ""The nature of these movements is that a spark could ignite the tinder,"" said Jon B. Alterman, the head of the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Middle East program. ""... And once it starts moving, you have no idea where it's going to go."" Israeli troop kill Palestinian man in West Bank clashes . Voids in Palestinian hope, leadership . Arafat is still considered a hero among many Palestinians, as the scenes around the West Bank commemorating his death November 11 showed. This was a man, according to his supporters, who stood up to Israel. This was a man who rallied Palestinians to fight. This was a man who got leaders around the world to buy into the idea of an independent Palestinian state. Fatah cancels Arafat memorials after bombings, blames Hamas . Not only is there no more Arafat, but the idea of a unified Palestinian front is a thing of the past as well. Arafat's former group, Fatah, now controls the West Bank under Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, while rival Hamas is in charge of Gaza. ""You have an unprecedented division,"" said the Brookings Institution's Khaled Elgindy, contrasting that to what he views as Israeli leadership that's become more conservative and less willing to compromise. ""It's a much weaker leadership than we've ever seen."" The lack of a unifying figure, like Arafat, has led to a ""complete alienation of the people from leadership,"" said Ingrid Jaradat Gassner of the Civic Coalition for Palestinian Rights in Jerusalem. Not only don't they have a person to rally around, there's no clear sense of a workable exit strategy that will end the cycle that makes life difficult for many Palestinians. ""People really have no expectation, no hope, no perspective in terms of there being any chance that comes through a political initiative,"" Gassner told CNN from her home in Bethlehem. ""So what we have is an outburst of frustration."" What there is not, however, is any clear organization in the recent efforts to lash out against Israelis -- which was unlike, many say, what happened during the second intifada. In some ways, that may be more frightening -- because instead of dealing with a known threat or plot you can unravel, only the attacker may know what will happen next. ""This is a huge problem because there is no intelligence,"" Amidror told reporters on a call coordinated by the Israel Project. ""Someone is getting up in the morning or going out of the mosque at noon and saying, 'Today, I'll kill some Israelis.' ""There is no organization behind it,"" the former Israeli national security adviser said, noting that all someone has to do is take a knife from their kitchen and attack. ""... I don't see any measures that can be taken to stop an individual (like that)."" 2 killed, 2 wounded in stabbing attacks on Israelis . Israeli policies have an impact . What's happening and what's not happening, if you're talking about major attacks, is a testament to Israel's policies as well. A lot has changed since what Israelis called the ""Passover massacre,"" when a man walked into a seaside hotel in 2002 and blew himself up, killing 30 civilians. For one, a wall -- or a fence, depending on where you are along the border -- has been erected between the West Bank and Israel, making it harder for anyone intent on attacking to cross over with explosives or weapons. Also, Israel has a renowned intelligence apparatus that's had years of practice in rooting out potential attackers. This is on top of other policies, like stringent measures restricting citizens' ownership of firearms. And even as it pushes for independence, the Palestinian Authority has quietly become a working security partner with Israeli authorities. Behind the scenes, the two sides have coordinated efforts to preemptively go after those who might carry out attacks, not to mention common foes from Hamas. ""The two have worked together, and it has prevented many terror attacks inside Israel,"" said the Israel Project's David Harris, predicting both sides will continue to coordinate even if they are publicly at odds. ""And it has also brought much more calm."" Yet as clashes in the West Bank last week showed, it sometimes doesn't take much for things to turn violent and get out of hand. And Palestinians don't live only there and in Gaza. Many live in Israel, including some 300,000 in East Jerusalem, where there has been recent unrest centered around what Jews know as the Temple Mount and Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary. ""The fear for Israel is that the new terrorists (will be) on this side of the fence,"" said Harris. Violence, bad feelings never went away . Even then, discontent among so-called Arab Israelis is not a new thing either. In fact, experts say -- from a security situation -- Israel appears safer from prospective terrorist attacks than it was 10 to 15 years ago. The measures it's instituted in that time have made it harder for armed attackers to get across its borders and inflict mass violence. But according to Gassner, Palestinians' frustrations ""have become worse and worse over time for a lot of reasons."" She says that many feel that Israelis -- whether through increased settlement activity or clamping down on borders and what she calls collective punishment following attacks -- are putting up obstacle after obstacle in their quest for ""normal lives."" ""People want to take care of their families, get their kids to school, have enough income to live off of,"" she said. ""And then the pressure just builds up. That's why we have these repeated eruptions of anger and frustration."" Elgindy, from Brookings, said more forceful responses by Israel to attacks can backfire, reasoning, ""When you respond to violence with more repression, you're going to get more violence."" The ""primitive assault tactics"" now being used against Israelis -- knives and cars, rather than rockets and bombs -- could help further the Palestinians' storyline, especially if Israeli security forces respond ""with a heavy hand"" as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office promised after Tuesday's synagogue attack, expert Assaf Moghadam said. ""(Such tactics) help portray the perpetrators ... as people of desperation; they can claim 'we don't have better means of disposal,'"" said Moghadam, from the Israeli-based International Institute for Counter-Terrorism. ""It's an asymmetric battle militarily of a weaker party against a stronger party."" It's the lack of an end game -- a result that will bring peace, security and happiness to both Israelis and Palestinians -- that has some especially worried. If there's no political end in sight, what's to prevent those frustrations from continuing to build? ""It's probably not going to get a lot worse, and it's almost certainly not going to get a lot better,"" said David Pollock, the director of the Washington Institute's Fikra Forum. ""The best you can say, on both sides, is, 'Well, at least we're not like Syria and Iraq.""","Stabbings, assailants driving into crowds have unnerved some in Israel .

"Supporters are coming to the defense of Matt Taylor, the scientist who helped land a space probe on a comet last week and simultaneously sparked cries of sexism with his choice of clothing. During the live stream of the Philae probe landing, Taylor wore a shirt featuring comic-book-style images of scantily clad women carrying guns. The shirt led some to denounce an atmosphere unwelcoming to women in the science fields and even inspired the Twitter hashtag #shirtstorm. Taylor, a project scientist for the European Space Agency, apologized Friday during a progress report on the Rosetta Project. ""The shirt I wore this week, I made a big mistake, and I've offended many people, and I am very sorry about this,"" an emotional Taylor said, wiping his eyes. We can land on a comet, but we can't ... Taylor shouldn't be the one apologizing, according to London Mayor Boris Johnson. In his Telegraph column, Johnson wrote that the ""unrelenting tweetstorm"" in response to Taylor's shirt, coupled with the scientist's emotional response to it, was a cruel act of public shaming. ""It was like something from the show trials of Stalin, or from the sobbing testimony of the enemies of Kim Il-sung, before they were taken away and shot,"" Johnson wrote. ""It was like a scene from Mao's cultural revolution when weeping intellectuals were forced to confess their crimes against the people."" The public should have been praising Taylor's accomplishments with the Rosetta Project, Johnson said. Johnson isn't the only one coming to Taylor's defense, with some concluding that complaints about Taylor's shirt overshadowed a momentous occasion. In a Time op-ed, Cathy Young highlighted that several women worked alongside Taylor to get the Rosetta Project off the ground, an accomplishment for women that didn't get nearly the attention that Taylor's shirt garnered. ""Thanks for ruining a cool feminist moment for us, bullies,"" Young concluded. A Daily Caller headline labeled the backlash ""Casual Marxism."" Some in the science field sought to go beyond the ""tweetstorm"" to explain why #shirtstorm was not just about Taylor's sartorial choice but highlights the larger issue of dismissive attitudes toward women in STEM, or the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Astronomer Phil Plait explained in Slate that while he doesn't want to tar Taylor with the ""misogynist"" label, the shirt is emblematic of the STEM boys' club, especially when paired with Taylor's casual comment about setbacks his team has faced during the Rosetta Project: ""She's sexy, but I never said she was easy."" ""If you think this is just women complaining, you're wrong. Certainly many have, and rightly so. But the fact is, I'm writing about it. I can point you to many men, friends of mine, scientists and science communicators all, who have spoken up about it. It's important that men speak up, and it's important that we listen, too."" The backlash against those who complained about Taylor's shirt is telling, college professor Janet D. Stemwedel wrote in Scientific American: . ""This response conveys that women are welcome in science, or science journalism, or the audience for landing a spacecraft on a comet, only as long as they shut up about any of the barriers they might encounter, while men in science should never, ever be made uncomfortable about choices they've made that might contribute (even unintentionally) to throwing up such barriers,"" Stemwedel wrote. The woman who sewed the controversial shirt as a birthday present for Taylor has written a blog post reiterating her support of the scientist, whom she calls ""close and very loved friend."" ""I am so proud of Matt and his achievements and the fact he is an interesting and very brave person to do what he did with the very sweet gesture he made towards my gift and to wear his individuality with pride,"" wrote Elly Prizeman. Though the shirt may have been a bad choice for the workplace, images of the heavily tattooed Taylor wearing it showed that modern scientists aren't all sporting pocket protectors and taped-together eyeglasses, some said. ""There must be room in our world for eccentricity, even if it offends the prudes, and room for the vague other-worldliness that often goes with genius,"" Johnson wrote in the Telegraph. ""Dr Taylor deserves the applause of our country, and those who bash him should hang their own heads and apologise.""","Scientist Matt Taylor's shirt featuring sexy images of women caused a backlash .

"Washington (CNN) -- Michigan Democratic Senate hopeful Gary Peters is the target of a Sharknado-inspired cartoon, but supporters say the ad is part of a campaign that ""jumped the shark."" The Michigan Republican Party has a new 30-second spot featuring Peters' face imposed on top of a Hawaiian shirt-wearing body, running away from a tornado that's spewing sharks out of the sky around him. One loudly belches up a wad of cash. ""Dark clouds are gathering, and Gary Peters is in the eye of the storm,"" the ad's narrator says. ""Funded by a convicted felon, connected to a loan shark ring, run by an international gangster who also contributed to Peters' campaign. Gary Peters: Loan Sharknado. Coming soon to a voting booth near you."" The convicted felon connected to a loan sharking ring is Xhafer Laho, who donated $6,100 to Peters between 2010 and 2014, and was recently sentenced to four years in prison. A Peters spokeswoman said the congressman has given back or donated those contributions -- most of them years ago. ""Down in all recent polls and relying on D-list cultural references, Terri Lynn Land's Senate campaign has officially jumped the shark,"" Peters spokeswoman Haley Morris said of the ad. The ad is part of a last-ditch effort by Republicans to turn the race into a competitive one ahead of the Nov. 4 midterm elections. On a map otherwise ripe with GOP pick-up opportunities, the race in Michigan -- which in presidential elections is a key swing state -- has remained outside of Republicans' grasp. RealClearPolitics' polling average shows Peters with a nine percentage point advantage over Land, who has struggled with local media and hasn't been able to overcome Democrats' efforts to latch her to the conservative Koch brothers. ""Consider this just the latest in failed gimmicks from Land that do nothing to distract from the fact that she is out of touch with Michigan's middle class,"" Morris said. ""It's clear Land can't defend her Koch-backed agenda that would eliminate a federal minimum wage, but she could spare Michiganders her desperation.""","The Michigan GOP is targeting Democratic Senate hopeful Gary Peters with a 'Sharknado'-themed ad.

"President Barack Obama condemned on Tuesday the attack on a Jerusalem synagogue that killed four Israelis as a ""horrific"" terror attack and urged Israelis and Palestinians to work together to ease tensions. Obama said Secretary of State John Kerry spoke Tuesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the wake of the attacks that killed three Americans when two Palestinians wielding knives, axes and a gun attacked the synagogue during morning prayers on Tuesday. Obama also identified the attack's three American-Israeli victims as Aryeh Kupinsky, Cary William Levine and Mosheh Twersky. ""We condemn in the strongest terms these attacks,"" Obama said. ""The murders for today's outrageous acts represent the kind of extremism that threatens to bring all of the Middle East into the kind of spiral from which it's very difficult to emerge and we know how this violence can get worse over time."" But Obama also stressed that ""a majority of Israelis and Palestinians overwhelmingly want peace"" and urged leaders on both sides to work together to ease tensions that have flamed in recent weeks over access to the Temple Mount and al-Aqsa mosque that sparked a series of attacks on Israelis and recriminations by some against Palestinians. Netanyahu on Tuesday also responded to the attack, ordering the demolition of the homes of the two Palestinian assailants, both of whom were shot dead at the scene by Israeli police. The decision came after a high-level security meeting between Netanyahu and his top security advisers as Netanyahu said Israel would ""respond with a heavy hand to the brutal murder of Jews who came to pray and were met by reprehensible murderers."" A member of the PLO executive committee would not outright condemn the attack, instead pointing to ""the continuing escalation by the Israeli occupation and the targeting of Palestinian civilians"" as provocation that led to the attacks, though she did note that she doesn't ""think violence is justified or can produce any results."" Kerry reacted to the news while in London, calling the attack ""an act of pure terror."" ""Our hearts go out to all Israelis for the atrocity of this event and for all the reminders of history that go with it,"" Kerry said. ""This simply has no place in human behavior and we need to hear from leaders who are going to lead their people to a different place."" Israeli spokesman Micky Rosenfeld later told CNN that three of the men killed in the attack held dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship. The fourth victim was a dual British-Israeli citizen. FBI is launching an investigation into the attack because three of the victims are U.S. citizens, a law enforcement official said. Meanwhile, Hamas did not claim responsibility for the attack but a senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad told Al Jazeera International ""there will be more revolution in Jerusalem, and more uprising,"" stating that Hamas ""supports action against the occupation.""","Obama urged Israeli and Palestinian leaders to reject violence .

"(CNN) -- For decades, pioneering environmentalist Stewart Brand, the founder and editor of the Whole Earth Catalog, opposed the use of nuclear power. Now he sees it as vital to efforts to combat climate change. Earlier this month, Brand made the case for nuclear power in a debate with Stanford University professor Mark Jacobson at the TED Conference in Long Beach, California. (TED is a nonprofit that took its name from the subjects of technology, information and design and is dedicated to ""Ideas worth spreading."" It publishes talks on all subjects at http://www.ted.com/) His outspoken support for nuclear power comes as the White House has been pushing for the first new nuclear plants in the United States in three decades. Last week, President Obama announced $8.3 billion in loan guarantees for adding two nuclear reactors at an existing plant in Burke County, Georgia, near Augusta. Mark Jacobson says nuclear power is too risky . Brand says his turnabout began in 2002, when the Global Business Network, a consulting organization he co-founded, did a project on climate change for the U.S. Secretary of Defense. In an interview with CNN.com, Brand said the project showed him that the globe's climate can change abruptly: ""It goes over some tipping point and suddenly you're in a situation that you don't like and you can't go back. That got me way more concerned about climate as a clear and present danger than I had been."" Looking for a surefire way to cut greenhouse gases, Brand said the alternative to burning coal became clear: ""We already had a very good supplier of ...electricity. It worked like mad and was as clean as it could be -- and that was nuclear. ""Looking at nuclear more closely made me look at coal more closely and I got to realizing what a horror it was across the board, and as I learned more about nuclear, I started learning all this stuff that my fellow environmentalists had been careful not to let me know about."" Read about Bill Gates' argument for nuclear power . Brand spoke to CNN.com Wednesday. Here is an edited transcript: . CNN: What did your fellow environmentalists get wrong about nuclear power? Stewart Brand: Well, things like, nuclear radiation is a terrible thing that we must all fear at any scale, and nuclear waste a thing that we must be horrified about, with it lasting hundreds of thousands of years and how dare we burden future generations with that. I started looking at the basic scientific and engineering lore on both those subjects. ... They are interesting engineering problems that are mostly solved already. CNN: How have they been solved? Brand: Anti-nuclear people have been saying, since Yucca Mountain [a proposed nuclear waste repository in Nevada] won't work or can't work, then you can't have nuclear. But then you think we do have nuclear, so nuclear waste must be coming out of these reactors ... so where's it going? It's going right there on the site in these dry cask storage containers where it doesn't seem to bother anybody. You can go out and look at them, stand next to them, no bad things happen. So it's already de-demonized as you see it as not this huge intractable problem. It's actually quite tractable and on a local level. And carting the stuff around is treated as such a terrible thing and ""My God, what if there's an accident?"" And you look at the videos that were made at Sandia [National Laboratory] years ago where they ran a locomotive into one of the containers, and no bad thing happened, and then they burned it in jet fuel, and no bad thing happened, dropped it from a great height, no bad thing happened. You start to realize this is actually pretty well in hand. And the rest of the story on that is the next generation of reactors, the so-called fourth-generation reactors, most of them use what we now call nuclear waste as fuel. ... So a lot of the waste issue goes away when you realize that a very good thing to do is to just park it somewhere while we think about whether we do want to stick it in the ground or use it in these fourth generation reactors. One of the things I learned is that we've already been burying nuclear waste in New Mexico at the waste isolation pilot plant for 10 years now. Works fine. It's a salt formation 3,000 foot thick -- you go half a mile down and that salt formation has been there for 250 million years. It's not going anywhere. ... It's a perfectly good place to stash this stuff if you want to get rid of it. Environmentalists will say there's no working nuclear repository anywhere in the world and you look and actually there's one being built in Finland. CNN: What about the potential for a release of radiation? Brand: The requirement is that no more than 15 millirems of radiation gets out to the public a year, and when a lady goes to get a mammogram she gets twice that. When you move from Connecticut to Colorado, the background radiation goes up five times that. And in medicine, we routinely use radioactive isotopes for a whole manner of diagnostic procedures, for x-rays and CT scans. ... Then you look at the medical studies, the epidemiology. People have been looking for human harm from radiation for a long time, ever since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And it came as a surprise to me to learn, there were no birth defects in children born to exposed parents in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. When the U.N. went to study the Chernobyl area after the accident there, there were no birth defects turning up in the women who had been pregnant during that exposure. Meanwhile, some anti-nuclear organizations have been using horrifying photographs of deformed babies with gross birth defects and saying these were caused by Chernobyl. It's just a lie, so that's a little alarming to see scare tactics like that based on nonscience. Obviously you do not want to go and get close to nuclear fuel. On the other hand, when you take the fuel out of the reactor and put it in storage, 175 years, seven generations later, the radioactivity of that fuel is one billionth of what it is when you took it out of the reactors. This stuff actually has a half-life that is good. ... Mercury doesn't have a half life, when mercury gets into the system, it bioconcentrates to the point where we tell pregnant women not to eat wild fish and shellfish because the mercury has accumulated, mostly from coal burning. ... CNN: What about nuclear proliferation, the potential for spread of nuclear weapons due to greater use of nuclear power? Brand: First of all you want to separate out nations where that's a worry and where it's not a worry. China and India we really need to have stop burning coal. ... Now is there a proliferation issue there? Not really -- China and India have nuclear weapons. The figure I quoted at TED was that 21 nations have nuclear power, only seven have nuclear weapons, and in every case they got the nuclear weapons first, then the nuclear power. Sweden has nuclear power -- 40 percent of their power is from nuclear. Do we worry about them having nuclear weapons? Probably not. So then that leaves a few countries that we are concerned about. Iran is one. Venezuela would like to be one. That's where Obama's program for fuel banking, which was actually started in a very intelligent way by the Bush administration, is the classic workaround. It's a thing which lets you know basically where all the fissile material is going in the countries that join the program. ...The great thing about nuclear weapons is when you downgrade the weapons-grade uranium, you get very good nuclear fuel. That's what the U.S. has been doing for 10 years with Russian nuclear weapons. I love the symmetry of that. The very warheads that used to be targeted at American cities to blow them up are now being used to light them. CNN: Some critics of nuclear power say that it takes so long to license and build nuclear power plants it's not really a practical alternative? Brand: ...Things can be accelerated a lot. So one of the things the U.S. is doing is separately licensing -- going through the whole approval process -- reactor designs before they have to be figured out in context of a particular site. ... Then there used to be this long delay of getting site approval, but as it happened, when we slowed down and stopped our reactor building in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, most of the reactor sites already had permission for additional reactors, so that part has already been done. ... Look, you're not going to cure greenhouse gases with nuclear, but curing greenhouse gases without nuclear is approximately impossible. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stewart Brand.","After decades as a foe of nuclear power, Stewart Brand now believes strongly in it .
He says the nuclear waste disposal problem has basically been solved .
Brand says danger of low-level radiation has been exaggerated .
Nuclear power is proven way to reduce greenhouse gases and replace coal-burning, he says ."
"In 1985, Meng Weina set up China's first private special needs school in the southern city of Guangzhou. As a single mother she was motivated to help those who are often overlooked by the country's health care system and stigmatized by society. From her first center in Guangzhou, Weina now has Hui Ling operations in a dozen cities across China providing a range of services, from kindergartens and primary schools to youth workshops and adult residential homes. The expansion of the donation-funded NGO shows not just the success of the Weina's vision but the desperate need for mental health care provision in China. ""We estimate that only 10% of people with intellectual disabilities in China are receiving some kind of care or help,"" said Weina. According to a 2009 study published in British medical journal The Lancet, around 173 million Chinese suffer from a mental disorder. However there are only 20,000 psychiatrists, equaling 1.5 for each 100,000 people, or a tenth of the ratio in the United States. Mental health legislation . Last year saw the introduction of China's first mental health legislation, which took a reported 27 years to pass. Among the changes from the law are new financing initiatives for mental health services and training for primary care-givers. Perhaps the most significant was a new set of rights for patients, including not being hospitalized against their will. Negative perceptions of those with metal health problems are often portrayed in the media in China; they are either victims or perpetrators of violence. Weina knows that each individual that comes to a Hui Ling center has their own set of needs and unique personality, and helping bring out their best encourages her to keep working. ""I wanted to do something to make my life worth while,"" said Weina. ""When I see the smiles on their faces, when I see that these adults are truly happy to be at Hui Ling, that for me is the happiest moment.""","Meng Weina set up first private special needs school in China .

"(CNN)Spray from Victoria Falls hits the faces of tourists and locals as they look down at Africa's most famous waterfall. The water acts as a wake-up call, but this spectacular sight is no dream. Located on the border of Zimbabwe and Zambia, tourists from all over the world arrive to witness the natural wonder. In 2013 alone, over 1.8 million people came to Zimbabwe on holiday according to the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority. That number may sound impressive, but tourism authorities say 2014 will be an even stronger year for the industry. ""Zimbabwe is pumping when it comes to tourism,"" says Barbara Murasiranwa from Zimbabwe's Tourism Council. ""We've picked up, gotten back to... where we were in 1999, and we are even surpassing the figures for 1999."" Murasiranwa has good reason to be optimistic -- the World Travel & Tourism Council expects tourism to make more money for the country in 2014 than any other year in the past decade. And recent figures also show hotels at Victoria Falls are enjoying solid business -- occupancy rates in the area reached 77.6% in August, up from 62.6% in the same period in 2013. Troubled past . But the tourism industry has been through tough times after its heyday in the 1990s. ""It was the land invasions and the violence and the bad publicity that the country received,"" says Trevor Lane of the organization Friends of Victoria Falls, explaining the industry's slump. ""[Zimbabwe] was perceived as a high risk country after that and tourism virtually stopped overnight."" Shortly after the world welcomed in a new millennium, more than 2,000 white owned farms, of five million hectares, were targeted by the government for resettlement. While authorities insisted the program was sustainable, some white farmers were subject to violence, and lost their property to emboldened groups of black Zimbabweans. Economic meltdown . Since then, members of the international community -- including the U.S. Treasury -- has imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe's president Robert Mugabe and his inner circle. The chronic economic mismanagement that followed saw a period of hyper-inflation, and citizens at some point had to pay 300 billion Zimbabwean dollars for a loaf of bread. According to the World Bank, ""Zimbabwe is in debt distress as total external debt at the end of 2012 remains high at 70% of GDP."" And these economic hardships hit the tourism sector hard. While over 2.2 million tourists arrived in 1999, by 2005 that number was 1.5 million. The industry has seen a shaky recovery since then, but the hard times are still fresh in the minds of hotel owners and tour operators. ""Tourism shrank massively,"" says Lane. ""A lot of people obviously folded, left town...the rest of us just managed to survive....until [the] revival started again a couple of years ago."" Improving infrastructure . In a move to ensure the troubled days don't return, Zimbabwean Minister of Tourism and Hospitality Industry, Walter Mzembi, has announced a $150 million plan to expand the airport at Victoria Falls. The project, which will be financed with a loan from China EXIM Bank, is boosting confidence amongst local business owners. ""Currently, the...short runway limits us as to the number of people that can come in on a flight,"" explains Jonathan Hudson, the manager of Safari Lodge -- one of the biggest hotels in Victoria Falls. ""The new 4 km (2.5 miles) runway, the new terminal, which will be able to hold up to five wide bodied aircraft, new carousels, increased immigration offices, is going to make a huge difference to us...With this we can increase the number of seats coming into Zimbabwe on a daily basis."" Looking ahead . But, as U.N. data shows tourist numbers worldwide grew by 5% in the first eight months of 2014, renewed confidence in the Victoria Falls region is palpable. ""I think Vic Falls is on a goldmine,"" says Karen Dewhurst from the cruise company Zambezi Explorer. ""It's a beautiful location, and people are beginning to hear about it, and with Zimbabwe being much safer...it'll definitely pick up."" Trevor Lane from Friends of Victoria Falls, is also optimistic. ""I think the future looks good. I think what we got to be careful of is that we don't sort of over capitalize...We don't want to make it into another Niagara Falls where it's over commercialized. But I do think that the future here is very bright."" Read this: Island paradise targets more beach-goers . Read this: Creating a new Cape Town through design . More from Marketplace Africa .

"The United States and the Soviet Union defined the world's first space race, but following South Korea's successful orbital rocket launch this week, it appears Asia  -- particularly North Asia -- is the world's new epicenter for space rivalries in the 21st century. ""In some sense we are already there,"" says Daniel Pinkston, North East Asia Deputy Project Director for International Crisis Group in Seoul, South Korea. ""The Chinese have been very active... (also) Japan, North and South Korea. It's quite a competitive atmosphere."" The race will only ratchet up later this year. In the second half of 2013, China will shoot for the moon with the aim of landing a rover vehicle on its surface; building on exploration milestones in 2003 and 2012 with the first man, then woman, in space. India plans to send an unmanned probe into Mars orbit this November. Last July, Japan's government set up the country's first-ever Cabinet-level office for space strategy to oversee the country's space policy and related budget. And on December 12 last year, North Korea joined the space club -- ahead of more technologically advanced South Korea -- with the successful launch of an Unha-3 rocket that placed an Earth observation satellite into orbit. It was a controversial first for the poverty-stricken nation, yet the country has vowed more launches. South Korea's own successful rocket launch makes it the fifth Asian country -- and just the 13th nation in the world -- to break the bonds of Earth. Space race as proxy for arms race? However, many see the space race as a proxy for a regional arms race. ""Many people will say that everybody is already running  --  that it's already on,"" says Pinkston. ""That said it's all relative."" ""It could be much worse. If you look at the percentage of GDP that's allocated militarily it could be much higher. For Japan, it's stayed under 1% of GDP. South Korea's is about 2.5%.  North (Korea) spends a lot, but there's no official number out. It's secret and difficult to ascertain."" South Korea's launch of the Naro-3 -- and its 800-kilometer range -- could add to regional tension. If used to propel a ballistic missile, it could reach most of East Asia. And with South Korea a strong Asian ally of the United States, other regional competitors may be rattled. ""China's main concern is that South Korea will be (used as) one of the (United States') first containment strategies,"" says Cheong Wooksik, Director of South Korea's Peace Network in Seoul. ""South Korea's extension of the range of its ballistic missiles will be used to check or contain the rise of China."" A South Korean ballistic missile can now hit most of China's main eastern seaboard cities including the financial hub of Shanghai, the northeastern port cities of Tianjin and Qingdao as well as the Chinese capital of Beijing. From apprehension to anger . Seoul's successful launch may be viewed with apprehension if not outright anger by its regional neighbors. ""North Korea will strongly condemn South Korea's launch,"" says Cheong of Peace Network, but adds that Pyongyang does not feel the international community would condemn South Korea's launch. ""North Korea will ask 'Why does the international community differentiate (between the launches of the two countries)'. It will consider that the world is applying a double standard,"" says Cheong. On January 22, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution condemning North Korea's rocket launch from December and expanded existing U.N. sanctions. With China, analysts believe the country's official response to South Korea's launch will be more muted but that North Korea will pressure Beijing to bend to its own line. ""North Korea will try to exploit the South's launch as hypocritical so they will pressure China to take that position...to share that view that this is an example of the hypocrisy and inequality of (this month's) U.N. Security Council Resolution 2087,"" says Pinkston. China was a signatory to that resolution, as was Japan. ""I don't think they (Japan) will say anything in that the South Korean program has been transparent,"" adds Pinkston. ""They've conducted themselves in a way that's non-threatening. South Korea does not have a nuclear weapons program. It has signed all the non-proliferation treaties."" But Cheong of South Korea's Peace Network disagrees. ""I don't think Japan will welcome (the) South Korean launch,"" he says. ""South Korea and Japan have many issues including (a maritime) territorial dispute. Japan's fundamental concern is that South Korea becomes stronger and stronger. South Korea's launch may, at least in small part, spur Japan's rearmament."" 'Fully competitive' Looking to the future, the historical lack of cooperation between Asia's orbit-reaching nations alludes more to competition than camaraderie. ""There's been some cooperation... I know Japan has launched one satellite at least for South Korea,"" says Pinkston. ""But in most other areas, science exploration, remote sensing, manned spacecraft... it's limited."" ""If you look on a continuum of 'full cooperation' to 'fully competitive' it's more leaning towards competitive.""","'Asia already in space race in some sense', says ICG's Daniel Pinkston .
China, India have moon and Mars ambitions in 2013 .
Space race is proxy for arms race but 'could be worse', says Pinkston .
South Korea rocket launch will not be condemned, says Peace Institute's Cheong ."
"(CNN)Wait! Were these really the Golden Globes that we watched on Sunday night? Couldn't have been. Where was the rampaging snark or the woozyboozy stage patter we've hated to love -- or vice versa -- year after year? It was a Globes ceremony on its best grown-up behavior. The outside world was more present than usual at this year's show, with a few shout-outs of freedom-of-speech solidarity with the victims of last week's deadly Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack in Paris. The topical jokes from co-hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler -- including a couple of pointed (and not too shabby) impressions of a lascivious Bill Cosby -- landed deftly enough, though the running gag featuring Margaret Cho as a grim-faced North Korean representative of the Hollywood press may have gone on slightly longer than it needed. In fact this year's show seemed to work harder than ever to keep the traffic flowing and the loose ends from dangling. Even those who were glumly pretending at humiliation (looking at you, Ricky Gervais) or succeeded at humiliating themselves (maybe we won't see your movie on Friday after all, Kevin Hart) didn't seem to have their hearts in it. For the most part, there was so much deportment, grace and dignified good intentions on display that you'd have thought you were watching the Oscars or something! And they're not the Oscars. That much hasn't changed. Voters for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of about 90 who write about movies and TV for the international press, have very little connection with or bearing upon the thousands of actors, directors, cinematographers, producers, writers, directors and other movie trades people who'll be voting on the Academy Awards. But perhaps this year, more than any other in recent memory, people peered into the Globes to get an early sense of who's got the legs to score big. That's because after a year that movie pundits considered among the more dismal in both overall quality and box office returns, there hasn't been a movie showing big-footed momentum heading into awards season. The verdict? Cloudy, but with some signs. Michael Keaton's prize for best actor in a comedy or musical seemed to signal a big night for ""Birdman,"" which also won for best screenplay. But ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" scored the best comedy or musical Globe, while ""Boyhood"" won for best drama. ""Boyhood's""  front-running status for best picture is likely solidified after winning so many year-end critics' awards. But that could change. Sunday night's audience -- which by the way contained far more people who will cast Oscar votes than it did HFPA voters -- seemed most galvanized when Prince awarded the best original song Globe to Common and John Legend for collaborating on the song ""Glory"" from ""Selma."" In his acceptance speech, Common further roused the house by saying, ""I realize I am the hopeful black woman who was denied her right to vote. I am the caring white supporter killed on the front lines of freedom. I am the unarmed black kid who maybe needed a hand but instead was given a bullet. I am the two fallen police officers murdered in the line of duty. 'Selma' has awakened my humanity."" It's not improbable that those listening may find themselves feeling the same way in a few weeks when they fill out their Oscar ballots. The outside world has a way of intruding on the bigger show, even in a year where there was more to be nervous about than inspired by.","Gene Seymour: Golden Globes shed snarky vibe for more sober ceremony this year .

"A newly discovered and often deadly virus related to one that causes the common cold has struck another victim, this time in France. A man hospitalized in April is infected with the novel coronavirus, France's Health Ministry said Thursday. The NCoV virus was recently found for the first time in humans and scattered cases have occurred across parts of the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia. It has proved deadly in more than half of the confirmed cases so far, according to the World Health Organization. Of 31 people with confirmed infections, at least 18 have died. But infectious disease specialists believe the virus is very difficult to catch. The newly infected man is the first confirmed infection in France, the Health Ministry said. He had recently returned from travel to the United Arab Emirates, which is on the Arabian Peninsula. Identifying the source of the man's ailment took time, the ministry said. France's Pasteur Institute confirmed the case Wednesday. The Health Ministry is seeking anyone who may have had contact with the patient. NCoV, like some common colds, is also caused by a coronavirus. And like a cold, it attacks the respiratory system, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said. But symptoms are severe and can lead to pneumonia and even kidney failure. ""Once it gets you, it's a very serious infection,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. NCoV has also been compared to related coronavirus, the one that causes SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which appears to have been contained in 2004, according to the CDC. Although its discovery in humans is new, NCoV would seem potentially deadlier, when contracted, than SARS. Of the some 8,000 verified cases of SARS, fewer than 800 people -- less than one-tenth of those infected -- died.","Out of 31 confirmed cases of infection, the NCoV virus has killed at least 18 people .

"(CNN) -- Children living in the Syrian city of Aleppo watch the sky. Not for signs of winter's approach, although the cold winds are already blowing, but for the barrel bombs, mortars and shellfire they know will not distinguish between military targets and their families' homes. It is hard to be a child -- or to have a childhood -- in Aleppo. The litany of deprivation and endangerment is long. Indiscriminate attacks have reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble. Across the city, more than a half-million displaced people are living in appalling conditions, struggling every day to find safe drinking water, enough food to feed their children, fuel, or even a warm place to sleep. Most hospitals are closed and most doctors and health professionals have been either killed, forced to flee, or unable to go to work. Interruptions in immunization programs have left tens of thousands of children more vulnerable to disease. The threat of attacks has driven some children underground into makeshift classrooms -- while others are learning in converted shops, mosques or empty buildings -- when they're lucky enough to go to school at all. This has been the situation in Aleppo for more than two years. And while some parts of the city remain relatively calm, escalating violence in recent months has signaled ominously of worse days to come. Despite all this, Aleppo is not a place without hope -- and there has been progress. Working with communities and local authorities, humanitarian staff are reaching some children and families in need across the city. In recent months, United Nations convoys, including those led by UNICEF, have been able to cross conflict lines, bringing with them critical supplies to help children suffering from a lack of nutrition and to increase the availability of safe water and improved sanitation. In all the hardest-hit areas of Syria -- in Aleppo, in Homs and in Deir Ezzor -- we are doing all we can to reach the hardest to reach children and families with therapeutic foods, water purification supplies, warm clothing, school supplies and textbooks, and other critical assistance as winter descends. Of course, we are acutely aware that this assistance is not enough. Not even close to enough, when there are up to 2 million people in the troubled city of Aleppo alone -- including 250,000 children and families in eastern Aleppo who are cut off from regular humanitarian assistance. When hundreds of thousands of children cannot be reached in rural Damascus due to fighting and siege. When the nation's youngest children have known nothing but war and adolescents are coming of age in a culture of conflict. The reality is that an entire generation of Syrian children is at risk, not only from violence itself, but also for want of education, protection and emotional support to help them overcome the trauma they have been suffering for nearly four brutal years. Without these critical necessities, how will they have the ability and the desire to rebuild their country someday? We must reach them, not only for the good our support can provide today, but for the hope for tomorrow it can help keep alive. For children who have been robbed of nearly everything, it is a reminder that they have not been forgotten. That their futures matter. In the end, the only solutions for Aleppo, and for Syria and for the region -- are political solutions. But in the meantime, the children of Aleppo need protection now. And we need unconditional, unrestricted humanitarian access from all sides now. Before another bomb or shell drops.","An entire generation of Syrian children is at risk, says Anthony Lake .

"It's the one fact about Mexico that you probably didn't know. The country's name is not really Mexico, at least not officially. After gaining independence from Spain in 1821, Mexico officially became the ""United Mexican States."" The American independence movement had inspired Mexican leaders of that era and since Mexico, in fact, also was a territory composed of states, the name stuck and became official in 1824. But the reality is the official name is used only by Mexican officials who deal with diplomatic protocol and official documents pertaining to international relations. For the rest of Mexicans -- and the world -- the country is simply known as Mexico. Mexicans feeling persecuted flee U.S. That's why outgoing Mexican President Felipe Calderon on Thursday sent to the Mexican Congress a piece of legislation to change the country's name officially to simply Mexico. Calderon, a conservative president better known for his war on drug cartels and organized crime, is literally in his last days in office. Enrique Pena Nieto, who was elected in July, takes office on December 1. It's still too early to know if the new Mexican Congress will quickly act on Calderon's bill or tackle other more pressing matters like security and the economy. In announcing his decision to propose officially changing his country's name, Calderon said Thursday the name United Mexican States was originally taken because back in 1824 the United States of America was an example of democracy and liberty for the new independent nations in the Americas. Opinion: To-do list for Obama and Mexico's new president . ""It's time that we Mexicans retake the beauty and simplicity of our motherland's name: Mexico.  (It's) a name that we use when chanting or singing, a name that identifies us throughout the world and that makes us proud,"" Calderon said. ""Mexico"" is a word first used by the Aztecs in their original nahuatl language.  The indigenous tribe founded a city called Tenochtitlan in the valley now occupied by the modern Mexico City. That original city was conquered by the Spanish in 1521. Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821. In Spanish, Mexicans pronounce the ""x"" in Mexico as a hard ""h."" Opinion: Racism in plain view in Mexico .","In 1821, the country was officially dubbed the ""United Mexican States""
Its leaders were inspired by the American independence movement .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps broke the Olympics' most hallowed record Sunday by winning an unprecedented eight gold medals in a single Games. Left to right: Brendan Hansen, Aaron Piersol and Michael Phelps celebrate Sunday's historic win. In modern Olympic history, no athlete has accomplished that feat. Until now, U.S. swimmer Marc Spitz's seven gold medals in the 1972 Games was the number to beat. Phelps tied Spitz's record on Saturday in the 100-meter butterfly, winning by 0.01 of a second. On Sunday, he took part in the butterfly leg of the 4x100-meter medley relay for the U.S. team -- and swam into the history books, 36 years after Spitz's wins. ""What he did was and still is an amazing feat, and will always be an amazing accomplishment for the swimming world and also the Olympics,"" Phelps said of Spitz. But, he added, ""I've said it all along, I want to be the first Michael Phelps, not a second Mark Spitz."" And in 17 swims over nine days at the Summer Olympic Games in Beijing, he became just that. Eight events. Eight gold. Seven world records, including breaking his own world mark in three of them. The only one where he didn't best the world time was in the 100-meter butterfly. Phelps, the hands-down favorite coming into the Games, won the 400-meter individual medley; the 200-meter freestyle; the 200-meter butterfly; the 4X200-meter freestyle relay; the 200-meter individual medley and the 100-meter butterfly. In the 4X100-meter freestyle relay, teammate Jason Lezak trailed by almost six-tenths of a second when he entered the pool for his anchor leg. But he blazed to victory and helped keep Phelps' pursuit intact. And on Sunday, a final victory in the 4X100-meter medley relay sealed the deal. ""Every moment that I've had so far in and out of the pool will be with me forever,"" he said. ""This has been one of the greatest weeks of my life, if not the greatest."" President Bush, at his ranch near Crawford, Texas, called Phelps Sunday morning. According to White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe, Bush told Phelps, ""Laura and I are proud of you. Our family is proud of you, but most importantly, America is proud of you. We're excited for you. You handled yourself with humility. Give your mom a big hug for me. '41' and I were honored to get a picture with her."" (The number 41 refers to Bush's father George H.W. Bush, the 41st president.) Sunday's win brings Phelps' total Olympic gold medal count to 14. And while many were quick to proclaim Phelps the greatest Olympian of all time, he has some ways to go. Larissa Latynina, a gymnast for the former Soviet Union, still holds the record for the most Olympic medals: 18 (9 of them gold) won in the '56, '60 and '64 Games. But Phelps is 23, and likely not yet peaked. Consider his evolution: At 15, Phelps competed in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, placing fifth in the 200-meter butterfly. The following year, he broke the world record for the event, becoming -- at age 15 years and 9 months -- the youngest male ever to set a swimming world record. When the Olympics came around again in 2004 -- hosted in Athens, Greece -- Phelps won six gold medals. This year, he won eight. ""Records are always made to be broken no matter what they are,"" he told reporters. ""Anybody can do anything that they set their mind to."" And after a vacation where ""I wont' do anything,"" Phelps said he's setting himself some loftier goals. ""There are some things that I still want to do,"" he said. ""I want to raise the bar in the sport of swimming more. It's come a long way. And I think it can go even farther. ""That's where I hope to take it. Even farther.""

"The killing of a 32-year-old man on the streets of St. Louis with a hammer was savage, random and senseless -- but it was not, that city's mayor said, related to what's been happening in nearby Ferguson, Missouri. The St. Louis metropolitan area remains on edge, a week after a grand jury decided not to indict then-Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of unarmed teen Michael Brown. That decision spurred emotional protests that sometimes devolved into looting and violence, unrest that carried racial overtones given that Wilson is white and Brown was African-American. But any claim that 32-year-old Zemir Begic's brutal killing had anything to do with this Ferguson uproar ""is absolutely unfounded,"" St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay said Monday on Facebook. ""There is no evidence that this was a crime occasioned by the race or ethnicity of the victim,"" Slay wrote in reference to Begic, who was white. The mayor made these comments after meeting with the family of Begic, who was beaten to death a hammer around 1:15 a.m. Sunday on a St. Louis street. ""I told them that our city mourned with them,"" Slay said. ""... An innocent life was savagely taken."" According to a probable cause statement, Begic, his fiancÃÂ©e and two others heard yelling and then someone jumped on the back of his car. The 32-year-old got out, at which point a teenager -- identified by prosecutors as Robert Mitchell -- taunted Begic and ""challenged him to a fight."" Then, ""all four men began assaulting (Begic), and at least one of them struck (him) with a hammer,"" the probable cause statement added, noting the attackers continued to beat Begic after he fell to the ground. He was unconscious by the time officers arrived, and pronounced dead after being taken to an area hospital. As to his attackers, police said that, ""after the assault, the juveniles fled the scene on foot."" Two of them -- juveniles age 15 and 16 -- were arrested later Sunday. A third teen was in custody by Monday, at which point authorities said they were still looking for a fourth suspect. Speaking about the attackers, Mayor Slay wrote on Facebook that ""we do not know their past."" ""Their futures, though, will be as grim as the judicial system can make it,"" he added. Police will review patrol patterns in the Bevo area, where the attack occurred. Yet Slay scuttled any suggestion that they were somehow to blame. ""It is not the police department's fault that no family members had any idea that their young people were on the streets that late,"" Slay said. ""Nor is it the police department's responsibility to educate or even to engage these young people. ""That responsibility, a community responsibility, is all of ours.""","A 32-year-old man died after being assaulted Sunday by a group, at least 1 with a hammer .

"ISIS militants killed more than 300 members of a Sunni tribe in a recent series of executions, the Iraqi government said Monday. Some of the 322 people executed were women and children, Iraq's Ministry of Human Rights said. The dead belonged to the Albu Nimr tribe, known for its fighting skill. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said Washington hasn't been able to confirm those figures, but ""we have no reason to doubt their authenticity."" The latest incident came Saturday when 75 members of Albu Nimr were taken from their homes and killed in the desert near the town of Hit, said one of the tribe's leaders, Sheikh Nabil Al-Ga'oud. It has been unusual for ISIS militants, who refer to themselves as the Islamic State, to kill women and children. ""We are not surprised by their actions,"" Al-Ga'oud told CNN. ""Their religious leaders have given them an order to kill all of our tribe and take everything that we own because we are fighting against ISIS."" He said nine children and six women were killed in Saturday's attack. A spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department condemned the ISIS attacks. ""This proves, once again, that (ISIS) does not represent anything but its warped ideology and provides more evidence, if any were needed, why our coalition partners, including Iraqis from every background, must work together to defeat these terrorists,"" Jen Psaki said at the department's daily briefing. The Albu Nimr, who number in the tens of thousands, are ready to fight to take back the town of Hit, Al-Ga'oud said Saturday. The city was seized last month by ISIS fighters after weeks of fighting the tribesmen. Hit and neighboring Ramadi were holdouts in the Sunni-dominated Anbar province after ISIS swept in from Syria, taking town after town in the western province. Albu Nimr tribesmen were among those who fought them until they began running of out weapons and supplies. Al-Ga'oud said an attack is ""imminent,"" adding that ""we are getting the support we need,"" in an apparent reference to backing by Iraq's central government. A 2003 Brookings Institution report observed that, though most Iraqi Sunni tribes were loyal to Saddam Hussein in the days when he ran the country, the Albu Nimr tribe had mounted a protest against the former Iraqi strongman in 1995 after the execution of a noted member. The protest was put down by paramilitary forces loyal to Saddam. In general, however, Saddam respected the Albu Nimr. Since Saddam's fall, they've been tapped to oppose al Qaeda in Iraq. They were also part of last year's Sunni uprising against the former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and his Shiite-dominated government. They have been fighting ISIS but say they haven't received much support from the Iraqi government and international coalition members. Kirby said U.S. advisers were working hard to improve the competence and capability of Iraq's army. ""The Iraqis are pushing back. They are going on an offensive against (ISIS) throughout the country,"" he said. ""Now it is not a major offensive, but they are reaching out to some areas.""","Pentagon says death toll number is probably accurate .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- He wants you to have a good night's rest at a good price. David Kong, CEO of Best Western . David Kong is the CEO of Best Western, the world's largest hotel chain, with more than 4,000 locations around the globe. A company man by nature, his management style is as smooth as the fresh linens on the beds. At the Best Western in New York's historic South Street, he tells The Boardroom about the difference he sees between the high and low ends of the hotel market. Maggie Lake: What's your memory of the first time you stayed in a hotel? David Kong: Well, that's easy, because when I grew up in Hong Kong my parents used to take me to hotels, and back in the '50s and '60s the hotels are where people went for nice dinners or nice brunches. And that's my childhood memory and that's why I am actually in the hotel business -- from those memories. Maggie Lake: You are in the service industry, where customer satisfaction is so important. How do you keep your employees motivated? David Kong: I think the most important thing is to really care about the employees that work for you. I started in the business being a busboy and dishwasher, so I have a special appreciation for people in those jobs. But I have also been a housekeeper to clean rooms, I have been a front-desk clerk, I've been a PBS operator. I've done all those jobs, and it helped me understand that those positions are really important, they are the backbones of the company. Maggie Lake: How would you describe your management philosophy now, though? David Kong: You know, I learned a lot throughout the years from the time when I was growing up -- My mom and dad had tremendous work ethic. They worked very long work hours, they were very dedicated for their work, so when I was growing up I was instilled with that work ethic. I believe in hard work, I believe in being dedicated to whatever you do. And when I was going to high school, I went to a Jesuit high school, and what they taught me was the thirst for knowledge, curiosity, and always reinventing yourself, the need to always improve. Maggie Lake: What do you gives think Best Western an edge over the competitors? And who do you see as your biggest competitor? David Kong: All the discount brands are competitive. Best Western really straddles across the whole spectrum of the mid-scale market. What we are really different about is we are not a Coca Cola, we don't take the same approach to building our hotels. Best Western hotels are independently owned and operated, what that means is when you check in to someone's hotel, you are really checking in to someone's home. There's a whole sense of hospitality. Because our members are the owners of the hotels. And they want to care for you as their guest. Maggie Lake: What's the biggest challenge for you as you look out in the next couple of years for the hotel business and for Best Western? David Kong: When the economy softens and the stock market goes down, then the hotel industry suffers as a result. And we want to be careful about the years coming, because the economy is only softening. And in addition to that, because after the very good years that we had just recently, there's been a lot of construction activities. There's many more hotels coming on board, so without all the supply, we need to be careful.","""I started in the business being a busboy and dishwasher""

"Apple's iPhone 5 broke records over the weekend, selling more than 5 million units. Most of those new owners, many of whom lined up at Apple stores and other retailers, are presumably happy with their new gadget, which has been praised for its bigger display screen, lighter and thinner form, and faster processor. But, as with many new tech products, there have been glitches, too. As the new iPhones get road-tested, buyers have taken to the Web to complain about issues ranging from the fixable to the unfortunately final. The doozy has been a spotty maps application. For the first time, Apple's latest operating system replaced rival Google's mapping service with its own. As many people got their first look at it with a new phone, they've found huge chunks of the world missing, or locations showing up in the wrong place. (Apple said the app is a work in progress and will be fixed.) Plenty has been written about that issue. But other gripes have emerged as well. Some sound legitimate. And, given the hyper-intense nature of the tech world's ""love-hate"" relationship with their gadgets, a couple just sound downright silly. After a few days of putting the new smartphone through its paces, here are five gripes people have with the iPhone 5. Google: No plans 'yet' for iOS 6 mapping app . 1. Scratches . Apple prides itself on making products that aren't just functional but beautiful as well. But users are reporting that after having their iPhone 5s for only days, or even hours, the sheen on the sleek, aluminum phone is getting scratched up. Melissa Jenna Godsey at iFixIt.com posted a YouTube video of her 2-year-old daughter hitting and scratching the phone's aluminum rear case with a set of keys, creating visible scratches and dents. Similar scuffing of the iPhone 4S revealed little, if any, damage. ""I know this is kind of an extreme case, but she's not the strongest two-year-old,"" Godsey said. ""And this all just happened, so I can only imagine what this is going to look like after a couple of weeks of solid use."" Answering an e-mail from a user, Phil Schiller, Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing, downplayed the issue. ""Any aluminum product may scratch or chip with use, exposing its natural silver color,"" Schiller said in the e-mail, reported and verified by Apple-centric blog 9to5 Mac. ""That is normal."" Translated on Twitter by PC Mag writer Sascha Segan: ""Apple: iPhones Aren't Chipping, They're Just Shedding Their Skins To Become Beautiful Butterflies."" 2. Lightning dock connector . The tech world is nothing if not full of change. But many longtime Apple users are irked at the company's decision to use a smaller connector port, called Lightning, on the iPhone 5 and new iPods. With one fell swoop, that meant both a need for new power cords and that the new products won't connect with older speaker systems, alarm clocks and other accessories. The fix? A $29 adapter (which costs $39 if you want a new cable with it). And even then, the adapter doesn't support video or the ""iPod out"" function for transmitting some data from the devices. ""Day 3 of having the new iPhone and I already lost the power cord #thanksapple,"" wrote one Twitter user. ""It's time to gouge our customers for a ton more money,"" Disqus commenter dawsg4ever quipped. A Lightning-to-USB cable costs $19 and, according to Apple's website, currently has a one- to two-week wait time to be shipped. 3. The phone's too light . We told you some of these are kind of weird. One of Apple's selling points for the new phone is that it's the lightest smartphone ever. One of the emerging complaints? That it's the lightest smartphone ever. To some users, a phone without the usual heft feels suspiciously cheap, toylike. Gizmodo rounded up some of the gripes under the headline, ""The Weirdest Thing People Hate About the iPhone 5."" Those, culled from Twitter, included these nuggets: . â¢ ""Can I be honest and say I wish the iPhone 5 was slightly thicker and heavier. Hate thin phones!"" â¢ ""Held the iPhone 5. Way too light for this spazz-attack. I need a heavier phone so I don't completely destroy it."" â¢ ""This new iPhone is way too light. I feel like its gonna just fly outta my hand with the slightest breeze #firstworldproblems"" Should you upgrade to the iPhone 5? 4. Screen issues . OK ... there are 5 million new phones in the wild now, so inevitably there are going to be some lemons. It's hard to know how widespread it is, but a handful of problems with the phone's touchscreen are bubbling up, too. One YouTube video shows what appear to be weird bubbles showing up on one part of the display screen when the user touches another. Threads on the Macrumors site also were filling up with people who said their screens started flickering just hours after getting their new phone. 5. Leaking light . Phones aren't supposed to leak. But users on multiple forums are reporting that light from the screen appears to be showing through gaps around the iPhone 5's antenna and power button. Boy Genius Report said it's happening on one of its phones and shows light streaming out of a small crack beneath the power button. The report said the leak is only visible in low light. Users said Apple has been offering replacements. 5 big changes in iOS 6 .","The iPhone 5 has sold more than 5 million units, but some users have gripes .

"British police want to question Robert Murat, a British man living in Portugal, in connection with the disappearance of Madeleine McCann at a Portuguese resort in 2007, a source close to the investigation told CNN. Police also want to question Murat's wife and several others, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Madeleine was a few weeks shy of her fourth birthday when she disappeared from her family's holiday apartment on May 3, 2007. Her parents had left Madeleine and her younger twin siblings asleep while they went for dinner with friends at a tapas restaurant nearby. Her mother raised the alarm when she checked on the children about 10 p.m. and discovered her daughter missing. Portuguese police named Murat as an ""arguido,"" or official suspect, some 10 days into the investigation. Murat denied the allegations and insisted he was innocent. The suspect status was subsequently withdrawn and no charges were ever brought. Murat received an apology and damages from several UK newspapers after reaching an out-of-court settlement with them over libel claims. British police had been expected to travel to Portugal next week, but that trip was delayed for reasons unknown, the source said. Murat's lawyer told CNN his client has not been informed of any British police request; Murat himself told ITV News he had been told of the development by Portuguese media.","The man, Robert Murat, has always denied any involvement .

"A woman who allegedly took her daughter in violation of a court ruling and then went on the run for a decade has turned herself in, according to U.S. marshals in New Hampshire. The whereabouts of the woman's now-18-year-old daughter remains unknown, authorities say. Featured on CNN's ""The Hunt"" in August, Genevieve Kelley was wanted by law enforcement since November 2004, accused of noncustodial kidnapping and unlawful flight to avoid persecution. Kelley, 50, along with her husband, Scott Kelley, 49, fled New Hampshire with her daughter, Mary Nunes, when the child was 8. At the time, the child's father, Mark Nunes, had full custody rights because of allegations of mistreatment, according to the Marshals Service. Marshals were involved in efforts spanning the United States, Canada and Central and South America to locate Mary Nunes and Genevieve and Scott Kelley. Genevieve Kelley was featured as the U.S. Marshals Service ""Fugitive of the Week"" in New Hampshire, coinciding with the nationally televised story of Mary Nunes and her kidnappers aired on ""The Hunt,"" which is hosted by John Walsh. See more on Kelley from CNN's 'The Hunt' After Genevieve Kelley surrendered Monday, U.S. Marshal David Cargill Jr., ""I am happy that (she) is in custody and will face justice for these charges, but we will all be the happiest, when we know Mary Nunes is safe."" Scott Kelley is considered a fugitive and is being sought, the Marshals Service said in a news release. Cargill credited the media and investigators for providing the ""push needed to get Genevieve Kelley to surrender.""

"A man was arrested at the White House Wednesday after the Secret Service found a rifle and ammunition in his car parked nearby. 41-year-old R.J. Capheim of Davenport, Iowa, approached a uniformed division officer at the White House and told the officer that someone in Iowa told him to go to the White House, the Secret Service said. Capheim approached the officer at 15th Street entrance, just north of the East wing. He told the officer that his car was located at 16th and Constitution, less than a half-mile from the White House. The uniformed division of the Secret Service proceeded to search his vehicle and found a 30/30 hunting rifle and ammunition. Capheim was arrested and charged with possessing an unregistered firearm. Additional charges may be pending. Wednesday's incident follows a string of security breaches at the White House which resulted in the resignation of Secret Service Director Julia Pierson and a shake-up of the agency's protocol. On Wednesday, Joe Clancy, the interim director of the U.S. Secret Service, said that the agency has been ""severely damaged in recent years by failures"" and explained some key mistakes made by the Secret Service when a fence jumper was able to run inside the White House two months ago. Clancy, who was tapped to lead the agency last month, appeared before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday and laid out protocols the Secret Service is trying to improve in the wake of the fence jumper and other problems in the past few years. His appearance comes a week after the Department of Homeland Security published a report revealing failures in training, equipment and communications at the agency.","A 41-year-old Iowa man approached a uniformed division officer at the White House .

"Democrats lost big on Election Night in 2014, but Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts argued Wednesday that some of the results were positive for the liberal wing of her party. ""Here is the second piece of really good news, we know what to do and the American people get it. They are ready,"" Warren said at the Center for American Progress ""Making Progress"" policy conference at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. She then launched into a portion of her speech about how some post-election polls found that battle ground voters stood closer to Democrats on certain issues. In particular, Warren highlighted a Hart Research project of battleground voters in 11 states across the country. The survey was conducted for the the AFL-CIO, a labor group. The Hart survey found that despite sending Republicans to Congress and to take control of the Senate, a majority of voters wanted to raise taxes on the wealthy, raise the minimum wage to $10.10 and increase funding for public schools from preschool to college. ""People across this country get it,"" Warren said. ""Sure, there is a lot of work to be done and there is a long way to go before Democrats can reclaim the right to say we are righting for America's people."" She added. ""No, we are not there yet. But don't forget the good news: Our agenda is America's agenda."" Warren, who is seen as the liberal heart of her party, was elevated to leadership after the trouncing her party took at the ballot box in November. Liberal groups have also argued that the 2014 election proved that liberal Democratic policies, like those Warren championed on Wednesday, are the future of the party. ""Warren was the most popular Democrat on the campaign trail for a reason: Her message of taking on Wall Street, reducing student debt, and expanding Social Security benefits is popular everywhere,"" wrote Adam Green and Stephanie Taylor, heads of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, in an opinion-editorial for The Hill.

"A doctor who spent time treating Ebola patients in West Africa died from the virus Monday in Nebraska. The death of Dr. Martin Salia, who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone, marks the second time Ebola has claimed a victim in the United States. ""It was an absolute honor to care for Dr. Salia,"" said Rosanna Morris, Nebraska Medical Center's chief nursing officer, at a news conference in Omaha. She sat alongside four other doctors who said they did everything possible to try to save the surgeon. Salia traveled between Sierra Leone, where he contracted the virus, and his home in Maryland, where his wife and children live. Morris said that caring for Salia taught the Nebraska team a lot. Spending time with Salia's wife, Isatu Salia, shed light on how anguishing it is to have a loved one suffer from Ebola, Morris said. The nursing chief praised the highly skilled and experienced medical team for trying to save a colleague. ""I want to thank our local heroes who took care of a global hero these past few days,"" Morris said. A legal permanent resident of the United States, Salia had been treating patients in Sierra Leone. That nation, Guinea and Liberia have been hit the hardest by the Ebola epidemic that began earlier this year. It is rare for someone to die in the United States from Ebola because medical and monetary resources are extensive -- much more so than in West Africa. At least 5,177 people have died of Ebola, most of them in those West African countries, according to the World Health Organization. Sierra Leone has reported nearly 1,200 deaths. The first Ebola patient to die in the United States was Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian national who traveled to Texas in September. Duncan, 42, died at a Dallas hospital. He initially went to the facility's emergency room after he began having symptoms, but he was misdiagnosed and sent home. Two days later, he was back, tested positive for the virus and began treatment. Complete coverage of Ebola . When Salia arrived Saturday at Nebraska Medical Center, he was in ""extremely critical"" condition, doctors said. His kidneys and respiratory system were failing. Ebola patients must get treatment as early as possible to have a chance at surviving, medical officials say. The doctor received a dose of ZMapp therapy and a blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor, doctors said. They did not disclose the donor's identity. The dose of ZMapp that was given to Salia on Saturday was an existing dose that had been provided to another hospital but had not been used, a spokesperson for Mapp Biopharmaceutical said. Your Ebola questions and answers . Salia had been able to walk himself onto the plane that transported him from Sierra Leone to the United States, but he was in ""very bad"" condition, recalled Dent Thompson, vice president of operations for the company that transported the doctor, Phoenix Air. Caregiving between countries . Salia split his time between New Carrollton, Maryland, and Sierra Leone, where he worked at a Methodist hospital, CNN affiliate WJZ-TV in Baltimore reported. The team caring for Salia in Sierra Leone characterized him as critical ill, possibly sicker than patients treated successfully in the United States, according to Nebraska health officials. The surgeon had taken a test for Ebola, which came back negative. It's unclear what produced the initial false result. A second test came back positive. Isatu Salia pushed to get her husband evacuated from Sierra Leone, the U.S. State Department said. An air ambulance crew evaluated him in Freetown and determined he was well enough to travel. Isatu Salia spoke to WJZ over the weekend. Too upset to show her face on camera, she described talking to her husband and feeling incredibly concerned. ""I know he's sick. He was a little slow talking,"" she said, breaking down in tears. ""I'm worried for him."" A reporter asked if she was confident her husband would get the treatment he desperately needed. She said she did and she was ""pleased"" with the action the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took when she phoned authorities there. It was an ""hour-by-hour situation"" when the ill surgeon arrived at Nebraska Medical Center, according to Dr. Phil Smith, director of the hospital's biocontainment unit. How the Ebola virus spreads . A man who gave selflessly . Maada Salia spoke admiringly of his father over the weekend. ""The fact that he would go back to his country and help is one thing that really amazed me because he showed the love that he has for his country,"" the son said. ""He doesn't think of himself as someone important. He puts himself down and helps those who really need help."" The White House released a statement of condolences to the Salia family. ""Dr. Salia dedicated his life to saving others. He viewed this vocation as his calling, telling his fellow United Methodist Church members that he pursued medicine not because he wanted to, but because he firmly believed it was God's will for him,"" the statement reads. ""Dr. Salia's passing is another reminder of the human toll of this disease and of the continued imperative to tackle this epidemic on the frontlines, where Dr. Salia was engaged in his calling.""

"Jose Mourinho bemoaned the ""worst season of my career"" after seeing his Real Madrid side slip to a 2-1 extra time defeat to capital rivals Atletico in the final of the Copa del Rey. Mourinho, who is widely tipped to return to take charge of English Premier League Chelsea, made his feelings clear to the media after seeing his last chance of silverware this season slip away. In the last few weeks, Real have lost in the semifinals of the Champions League to Borussia Dortmund and seen arch-rivals Barcelona clinch the Spanish La Liga title. A season which started with such promise after beating Barca to win the Spanish Super Cup has petered out and left the ""Special One"" frustrated. ""This is the worst season of my career with a title that is not sufficient  to satisfy Real Madrid and therefore it is a bad season. ""With a final, a semifinal, second place in the league and the Supercup,  what for many would be a good season, for me is the worst."" Pressed on his likely move to Chelsea, Mourinho refused to be drawn. ""I have a contract for three more years and I have still not sat down with  the president to talk about my future,"" he said. ""I have to be honest. Until the day that the president sits down with me  and the club does something official it has to be like this."" If the match in the Santiago Bernabeu Friday night is to prove Mourinho's swansong at Real, it didn't go as   planned. It wasn't the best of nights for his talisman Cristiano Ronaldo, either, as he saw red in the dying minutes. Mourinho was ordered to leave the touchline by the referee for protesting a decision late in the second half as Atletico won their first Copa del Rey in 17 years. The scrappy contest that featured more than a dozen yellow cards and two reds was settled by Miranda's header in the eighth minute of extra time on a night when it seemed Atletico, which hadn't beaten their city rivals since 1999, were destined to lift the trophy. After Ronaldo opened the scoring in the 14th minute with a typically impressive header, Diego Costa leveled on a counter attack in the 35th after superb work by striking partner Radamel Falcao. Real Madrid struck the post three times prior to the game entering extra time and Atletico keeper Thibaut Courtois made two stunning saves to preserve the victory and help end his team's three-match losing streak in Copa finals. The affair turned ugly in the dying minutes, with Ronaldo given a straight red card for kicking out at Gabi and players from both benches having to be separated. Courtois fell to the ground when struck by an item thrown from the stands at Real's home stadium. Mourinho believed his team should have lifted the cup and had been plain unlucky. ""The result is 1-1 and it is not normal to hit the post three times,"" he said.  ""You don't have to be a magician of football to think that the result is not fair, that Atletico are not the deserved winners of the final. ""The refereeing is forgotten, the shots off the post are forgotten, all  that remains is that the winner is Atletico."" Winning manager Diego Simeone was simply delighted while acknowledging their fortune. ""It was an incredible game. We had the luck you need to have to be  champions,"" he told gathered reporters.","Atletico Madrid beat Real Madrid in extra time for first Copa del Rey title in 17 years .

"(CNN)Daniel Donovan, the prosecutor in the case surrounding the death of an African American man at the hands of a white police officer, was endorsed by the Staten Island Republican Party this weekend as their pick to replace resigned GOP Rep. Michael Grimm, according to local reports. Party Chairman John Antoniello chose Donovan after interviewing both him and Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, who has also expressed interest in the seat. Antoniello said, however, the 31-member executive committee showed their support ""overwhelmingly in favor of Dan"" in an informal poll. ""At the end of the day, we felt, the committee felt, overwhelmingly that Dan Donovan would make a better candidate,"" he said, according to the Staten Island Advance. Though the Brooklyn Republican Party has yet to endorse a candidate and has informally expressed support for Malliotakis, Staten Island makes up the vast majority of the district's population, and the SIGOP's endorsement all but ensures Donovan will win the GOP primary outright. The endorsement, which came as no surprise, was issued Saturday, the day after Donovan officially launched his bid for the seat. National Republicans have privately expressed some concerns over Donovan's involvement in the case concerning Eric Garner, the African American man who died at the hands of a white police officer following a banned chokehold. Donovan was prosecutor in the case in which the grand jury decided not to indict the police officer, a decision that fueled further anger and protests from Americans nationwide frustrated by what they see as the unfair treatment of minorities by law enforcement. Grimm won a decisive victory despite the cloud of controversy hanging over him after he was indicted last spring on 20 counts, including the tax fraud charge to which he ultimately pleaded guilty, which could result in jail time. The swing district has long been a top target for Democrats, but their hopes for an early pickup this cycle grew when Grimm announced his plans to resign from the seat after entering his guilty plea shortly before the start of the new Congress.","Dan Donovan, the prosecutor in the Eric Garner case, is the Staten Island GOP's pick for Michael Grimm's seat .

"Chris Christie -- a self-styled truth teller with a penchant for political combat -- was notably cautious Wednesday when pressed on President Barack Obama's plan to issue immigration executive orders. At the annual meeting of the Republican Governors Association here, the New Jersey governor and potential 2016 presidential contender repeatedly avoided weighing on the Obama plan that could defer deportation for almost four million undocumented immigrants. Christie, the RGA's chairman, addressed reporters at the conference and basked in the glow his successful 2014 election cycle, proudly flanked by new governors-elect from the blue states of Illinois and Maryland. But even as other Republican governors with White House ambitions sharply attacked the President's decision, Christie hedged on the hot-button issue when reporters broached the subject. ""Let's wait to see what the president says tomorrow night before we have any kind of reaction to that,"" Christie said when asked about the immigration announcement. He did express confidence that the new Republican leadership in Congress will avoid a government shutdown over the matter despite threats from hard-line conservatives. ""All this kind of hysteria about shutdown to me is just people wanting to make news,"" Christie said. ""I have confidence in the Speaker, I have confidence in Leader McConnell that they'll do this the right way and run the government."" Later, asked if he would repeal Obama's executive actions on immigration if he were elected president, he punted again, saying that questions about a hypothetical candidacy were irrelevant. ""I am not going to articulate the basis of a yet unknown candidacy,"" he said. Christie instead turned the focus back to New Jersey where, he said, ""we've been dealing with this stuff already, because of the president's unwillingness to deal with this issue."" He pointed to a version of the DREAM Act he signed last year granting tuition breaks to children of undocumented workers â a bill that rankled some conservative activists in early primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire â and flagged his opposition to driver's licenses for illegal immigrants. Other governors at the meeting, including several eyeing their own White House bids, were more willing to condemn the president, often in blunt terms. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, said the president should sit down with congressional leaders and work on a piece meal approach to immigration reform. ""I think it would be a profound mistake for the president to overturn America's immigration laws with a stroke of a pen,"" he said. Ohio Gov. John Kasich called unilateral action a ""mistake."" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal called the move ""illegal"" and said the president is breaching Constitutional separation of powers. Texas Gov. Rick Perry also called the executive order unconstitutional. Obama is also putting his own party in jeopardy, he said. ""I think he jeopardizes long term the Democrats ability to ever get back into power in Washington, D.C.,"" Perry said. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said Congress could file suit and lake legal action against the president. There would be a ""compelling"" case to made against the president in the court system, he said. Though his potential rivals might have been drawing a policy contrast with Christie ahead of next year's primary, they and other Republicans gushed over his political work atop the RGA. Christie raised over $100 million to elect GOP governors in 2014 and even went into debt to help pull long-shot Republican candidate Larry Hogan over the finish line in deep-blue Maryland. ""I want to thank Gov. Christie for believing in us, and the RGA for coming to the rescue,"" Hogan told reporters. Bruce Rauner, the governor-elect in Illinois, called Christie ""a relentless campaigner."" ""I've never seen anything like it,"" he said. And Pence said ""the country owes a debt of gratitude"" to Christie for helping install 31 governors in state houses across the country, the most for either party in 16 years. ""I speak on behalf of all the Republican governors, when I say thank you to Gov. Christie for his extraordinary leadership,"" Pence said.â .","Chris Christie was in Florida at annual meeting of the Republican Governors Association .

"An American imprisoned for nearly a month in the United Arab Emirates for taking photos has been released from custody and returning home to Georgia, a family spokeswoman said. Robert Alan Black -- who'd  been in the UAE to speak at an international creativity conference -- had been held in Abu Dhabi's Al Wathba prison since October 21 after being ""charged with taking pictures of restricted areas,"" said Rosemary Rein, the spokeswoman for Friends of Alan Black. A former architect, Black often takes photos of buildings, according to Rein. Doing so is prohibited in some parts of the UAE, particularly in and around government buildings, embassies, military facilities and other places that are considered sensitive. He made a brief court appearance Monday, and was released the following day. ""The court found that the action was committed with no ill-intention, and ordered the minimum fine of 500 (UAE dirhams or about US $135),"" according to Rein's statement, which was posted to a ""Free Robert Alan Black"" Facebook page. After his release, the 70-year-old headed to his home in Athens, Georgia. ""We're relieved and happy with this news,"" Rein said.

Black characterizes himself as an architect, cartoonist, graphic designer, professor and creativity consultant on his website. He has given presentations at more more than 150 creativity conferences on six continents since 1978, and has written more than 600 articles and a book, ""Broken Crayons: Break Your Crayons and Draw Outside the Lines.""

Kurdish security and government officials didn't answer CNN calls for comment. Irbil is the capital of Kurdistan's regional government, which is under the control of Kurdish and Peshmerga forces. The ISIS militant group has taken over small villages in Nineveh province, close to the Kurdistan region, but Irbil is still relatively safe. The explosion near the governor's office in the heart of the KRG capital is significant because the Kurdish region has had a history of stability, even during the sectarian battles between Sunnis and Shiites between 2005 and 2007.","The blast happened in Irbil, the capital of the Kurdistan regional government .

"(CNN)It's been a turbulent start to 2015 for leading Spanish club Barcelona as it sacked director of football Andoni Zubizarreta, while Carles Puyol decided to step down from his assistant sporting director role. Zubizarreta's dismissal follows Sunday's disappointing 1-0 La Liga defeat to Real Sociedad and the news last Tuesday that the club had lost its appeal to the Court of Arbitration of Sport (CAS) following the decision to ban it from being able to sign new players over the next 12 months. A former goalkeeper for the club, Zubizarreta  had been responsible for Barcelona's transfer business since returning to the Camp Nou in July 2010. ""The FC Barcelona President Josep Maria Bartomeu has decided to terminate as of today the contract of the Club's Director of Football, Andoni Zubizarreta,"" an official Barcelona statement read. ""The President, in the name of the Club, thanks Andoni Zubizarreta for his contribution, dedication and professionalism over the last four years in his role at the head of the Club's football area."" Zubizaretta wasn't the only leading figure at Barcelona to leave the club Monday after Puyol confirmed on his Facebook page that he would also be departing. A former captain of the club, who won three Champions League crowns and six La Liga titles, Puyol was appointed assistant sporting director soon after retiring as a player in May. ""These last three months gave me the opportunity to see the other side of the club. I learned a lot, I am very grateful and, now, I want to try other things from another perspective and in other places,"" Puyol wrote. ""I want to grow both personally and professionally so that, in the future, I can return to this home and give back all that you gave me during these unforgettable years. ""I remain extremely grateful to the employees, directors, president and sports management for trusting me and for helping me in this transition that was not easy. ""And most of all to the fans who, if I felt they were supportive when I played, now, since my retirement, I feel that even more. ""I wish I could have said good bye to everyone with my boots on, but life does not always goes as one desires. I have been and I am very fortunate too feel as much love and support, for which I can only say THANK YOU and let you know that I will always carry you in my heart. ""Long live BARCA."" CAS's decision, which found Barcelona guilty of breaching FIFA rules on signing minors, means the club is unable to add to its squad during the next two transfer windows. The Spanish club, also hit with a $455,000 fine, says the transfer ban is ""disproportionate"" and ""excessive."" After Barcelona's loss to Real Sociedad -- a result which meant it missed the chance to move top of the La Liga table -- Zubizarreta suggested in an interview with Canal+ that he was not solely to blame for the transfer ban. ""Taking responsibility is to explain the actions, how the decisions were made, but I have little to explain because the vice-president [Bartomeu] who was in charge of that area [at the time] is the current president,"" he said. FIFA first issued the ban in April, but with Barcelona appealing the decision it was free to buy players until that appeal was then rejected by world football's governing body in August. Zubizarreta helped to bring Luis Suarez to the club from Liverpool in the summer, which was met with much excitement from supporters, yet other signings have not been met with such acclaim. Douglas was signed from Sao Paulo but has only made three appearances this season, while Thomas Vermaelen has yet to make his debut for the club since joining from Arsenal due to injury. Zubizarreta also helped sign the likes of Adriano, Javier Mascherano, Alexis Sanchez, Cesc Fabregas and Neymar, who have all proved relative successes. Neymar's transfer, however, cast a shadow over Barcelona, with Spain's authorities accusing the club of tax fraud. Zubizarreta played for Barcelona between 1986 and 1994, helping the side to a first ever European Cup in 1992. The Spanish club is yet to announce who will fill the vacancy left by the 53-year-old.","Andoni Zubizarreta dismissed by Barcelona from role of director of football .

"Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama's Keystone pipeline headache is only going to get worse. Democrats -- in their final weeks of controlling the Senate -- successfully blocked a bill Tuesday that would authorize the pipeline from hitting the president's desk. But the reprieve won't last long. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell immediately vowed that Keystone would be ""an early item on the agenda in the next Congress."" Keystone, a pipeline that would connect Canada's oil sands to the Texas coast, has been a rallying cry for the GOP throughout the Obama presidency. Republicans have unsuccessfully tried to attach the issue to a host of bills over the years, including a payroll tax cut. Poised to assume full control of Congress for the first time in nearly a decade, there's pent up energy to finally approve legislation. And the GOP is working hard to build a coalition that even a presidential veto can't block. ""If you do the math, we have 59 votes today,"" said North Dakota Republican Sen. John Hoeven. ""But if you look at the new Congress, you can count four more right away (and) I think there may be others."" Hoeven, one of Keystone's biggest backers, said he is aiming for 67 votes to override a likely presidential veto and said Republicans could attach a Keystone XL bill to a bigger measure Obama would be under pressure to sign, like a government financing bill. A veto-proof majority in the Senate next year isn't impossible. On Tuesday, 14 Democrats sided with Republicans on Keystone. While some of those Democrats won't be returning to the new Senate, the vote suggests a level of support in the party that must grab the attention of the White House. A growing number of Democrats may be beginning to feel, privately at least, that the pipeline might be a battle that is becoming unsustainable. ""They need to get this issue behind us once and for all,"" said Jim Manley, a longtime former communications aide to Democratic Majority leader Harry Reid and Sen. Edward Kennedy. Significantly, the White House has not yet specifically threatened to veto a bill seeking to approve Keystone. But it has left no doubt of Obama's distaste for the project. ""It certainly is a piece of legislation that the president doesn't support,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Tuesday. Opinion polls have shown that majorities of Americans favor the pipeline, despite warnings of environmentalists it would swell carbon emissions and threaten fragile ecosystems on its route. Oil industry leaders seem to believe that the political winds are now finally in their favor. ""Today's vote in the U.S. Senate demonstrates a growing and high level of support for Keystone XL,"" said Russ Girling, president and chief executive of TransCanada, which is behind the project. ""Keystone XL is not going away, the president will have to deal with it, if not now then next year,"" said Jack Gerard, President and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, which represents US oil and natural gas firms.  ""We will not give up until the pipeline is built."" But the environmental lobby and opponents of the project, who are still celebrating a major climate deal announced last week by the president in China, took heart from another delay for Keystone. ""We're more confident than ever that this pipeline will never be built,"" said Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president of the League of Conservation Voters. Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, who led opposition to the bill, said she was proud her party had stood firm for the ""health of the planet,"" but admitted ""I know the fight is far from over."" Tuesday's vote on Keystone XL, the 1,200 mile stretch of a bigger TransCanada network was really a sideshow. Party leaders permitted a poignant but futile attempt by Democrat Mary Landrieu to show voters in Louisiana, where oil is king, that she still has Senate clout before a runoff election. But politics is a cruel game. Despite her personal appeals to colleagues with whom she has served for years in the Senate, Landrieu fell one vote short of putting the president on the spot. In many ways, Keystone has become a cause that carries more political importance than commercial or environmental significance. For Green groups in Obama's base, it has become the focal point of a struggle against the fossil fuels industry and a test of the president's fealty to progressive principles. But Republicans have repeatedly hammered Obama for opposing what they say is a project that will lead to thousands of jobs and boost energy resources. Obama was scathing about those claims last week. ""I have to constantly push back against this idea that somehow the Keystone pipeline is either this massive jobs bill for the United States, or is somehow lowering gas prices,"" Obama said. ""It is providing the ability of Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else."" Republicans have a blunter message. House Speaker John Boehner linked the administration's Keystone resistance to comments by Obamacare adviser Jonathan Gruber, who has come under fire for saying ""the stupidity of the American voter"" helped ensure passage of the law. Vetoing a Keystone bill, Boehner warned on Tuesday, ""would be equivalent to calling the American people stupid.""","The Senate blocked a Keystone bill from advancing Tuesday .

"(CNN)Books, filled with prayers for peace, splattered with blood. Sacred vestments shredded by bullets and knives. Lifeless bodies in the sanctuary. The rabbis had gathered to ask God to bestow blessings upon their troubled land. Their prayers were interrupted by two men wielding butcher knives and a gun. An Israeli police officer and four rabbis were killed, including an American whose family is considered ""rabbinic royalty."" Combined with the site of the slaughter -- a synagogue in West Jerusalem -- the targeting of rabbis struck at the soul of Jews around the world, several Jewish leaders said Tuesday. ""This is an attack on all of us,"" said Rabbi Shmuel Herzfeld, who leads Ohev Sholom Synagogue in Washington. ""Any terrorist attack is a horror. But to attack people while they are engaged in prayer, are talking to God, is a new low."" In fact, both sides in the seemingly endless fight between Israelis and Palestinians have attacked people at prayer. In 1994, a Jewish extremist murdered 29 Palestinians worshiping in Hebron. In 2002, Palestinian extremists attacked a Passover Seder in Natanya, killing 30. Like those assaults, Tuesday's murders threaten to ignite another inferno of unholy violence. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the attack, but Hamas and other Palestinians praised the terrorists, identified by police as two cousins from East Jerusalem. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office vowed to ""respond with a heavy hand"" to the killings. The attackers, identified as Ghassan Abu Jamal and his cousin Udayy Abu Jamal, were killed by police responding to the synagogue assault, authorities said. Sami Abu Zuhri, a spokesman for Hamas, linked the attack to the discovery Sunday of a Palestinian bus driver hanged in his bus not far from the synagogue where the rabbis were killed. But relatives of the terrorists told The New York Times  the men were motivated by Israel's recent closure of Jerusalem's Temple Mount/Noble Sanctuary compound, a site holy to both Jews and Muslims. The site has since been reopened, but the dispute has fueled small-scale attacks by Palestinians that have killed six Israelis in recent weeks. In the United States, the horror of Tuesday's terror attack unified Jews across the political spectrum, even those who sharply disagree with Netanyahu's handling of the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. In an editorial, the Jewish Daily Forward said the frustration of Palestinians ""living under occupation"" is understandable. But killing innocent men at prayer is morally indefensible, the newspaper said, noting that the synagogue is in West Jerusalem, not in ""contested territory."" Killing innocents anywhere is detestable, Jewish leaders said Tuesday. But there is something especially heinous about killing people while they pray. ""We look on our ministers, priests, rabbis and mullahs as intermediaries between ourselves in the divine world,"" said Peter Machinist, a professor of Hebrew at Harvard University. Within the slain rabbis' ultra-Orthodox tradition, respected rabbis are assumed to have a ""hot line to heaven."" ""So an attack on them is a little closer to being an attack on God,"" Machinist said. The four rabbis killed were: Avraham Shmuel Goldberg, 58; Aryeh Kopinsky, 43; Moshe Twersky, 59; and Calman Levine. Goldberg was a dual British-Israeli citizen, and the other three were U.S.-Israeli citizens. ""This was an attack by Palestinian terrorists of pure evil and would have been utterly deplorable wherever, whenever it had occurred,"" said Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, the former chief of rabbi of Britain. ""But for this terrorist attack to occur in a synagogue, deliberately targeting innocent Jews deep in prayer, is something that strikes at the soul of Jewish people around the world."" Obama condemns 'horrific' Jerusalem terror attack . The Muslim Political Affairs Council also condemned Tuesday's attack. ""We strongly believe that houses of worship should be a sanctuary for all people, not a place of violence as we regretfully witnessed today. Islam commands its followers to protect houses of worship,"" the group said in a statement on Twitter. Moshe Twersky, originally from Boston, comes from an almost Kennedy-like clan of respected scholars and rabbis. His father, Rabbi Isadore Twersky, was a world-renowned expert on Jewish theology and founding director of Harvard's Center for Jewish learning. Twersky's maternal grandfather was Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik, a philosopher and professor at Yeshiva University who was considered one of the most important minds in Modern Orthodox Judaism. ""It's a very prominent family in Jewish life, in Jewish scholarship, in Jewish theology,"" Machinist said. Herzfeld said Soloveitchik was responsible for training thousands of rabbis who passed through Yeshiva University in New York, where his legacy still burns bright. Twersky's brother, Mayer, teaches at the university. Family legacy aside, what makes Tuesday's attack all the more galling, Jewish leaders said, is that the rabbis planned to engage in the very opposite of terrorism: praying for peace. ""That's what's so horrible about this,"" said Herzfeld. ""These people were trying to do their part to bring good into this world through their dedication to God."" 'Grief and outrage' at Jerusalem synagogue slayings . Other Jewish leaders noted that the rabbis likely did not expect their morning service to be interrupted by an assault. ""If you are truly at prayer, you are most vulnerable,"" said Jane Eisner, the Forward's editor-in-chief. Worshipers are not looking around for potential terrorists; they are focused on God. During the central prayer of Jewish services, the Amidah, it is considered sacrilegious to interrupt worshipers. ""Amidah"" means ""standing"" in Hebrew, and Jews are taught to imagine themselves standing before God, asking for his blessing, said Herzfeld. By tradition, the last prayer asks for peace in Israel. It's unclear whether the rabbis had reached that point when the slaughter began.","Killing of rabbis strikes at soul of Jews around the world, Jewish leaders say .
In the U.S., the horror of the attack unifies Jews across the political spectrum .
Something especially heinous about killing people while they pray, leaders say .
Muslims also condemn attack, saying followers of Islam must protect houses of worship ."
"At least 1,700 military veterans waiting to see a doctor were never scheduled for an appointment and were never placed on a wait list at the Veterans Affairs medical center in Phoenix, raising the question of just how many may have been ""forgotten or lost"" in the system, according to a preliminary report made public Wednesday. Describing a ""systemic"" practice of manipulating appointments and wait lists at the Phoenix Health Care System, the VA's Office of Inspector General called for a nationwide review to determine whether veterans at other locations were falling through the cracks. It also appears to indicate the scope of the inquiry is rapidly widening, with 42 VA medical centers across the country now under investigation for possible abuse of scheduling practices, according to the report. Among the findings at the Phoenix VA, investigators determined one consequence of manipulating appointments for the veterans was understating patient wait times -- a factor considered for VA employee bonuses and raises, the report said. The preliminary report sparked outrage from all corners, with Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki calling the findings ""reprehensible"" and ordering the 1,700 veterans be immediately ""triaged"" for care, while some lawmakers called for the agency's chief to resign. Shinseki has been on ""probation"" since President Barack Obama vowed last week to hold accountable those responsible for the delays, and he remains on ""thin ice"" with the President pending the outcome of the internal investigations, a White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN. The VA is under fire over allegations of alarming shortcomings at its medical facilities. The controversy, as CNN first reported, involves delayed care with potentially fatal consequences in possibly dozens of cases. CNN has reported that in Phoenix, the VA used fraudulent record-keeping -- including an alleged secret list -- that covered up excessive waiting periods for veterans, some of whom died in the process. 'Numerous allegations' The big questions remain under investigation, according to the report: Did the facility's electronic wait list omit the names of veterans waiting for care and, if so, at who's direction? And were the deaths of any of these veterans related to delays in care? ""To date our work has substantiated serious conditions at the Phoenix facility,"" said the report, which also found another 1,400 veterans were on the Phoenix VA's formal electronic wait list but did not have a doctor's appointment. The report also found ""numerous allegations"" of ""daily of mismanagement, inappropriate hiring decisions, sexual harassment, and bullying behavior by mid- and senior-level managers."" Calling the report's initial findings ""damning,"" House Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller, R-Florida, said ""you can only imagine"" what might come out once a fuller investigation is completed. The investigation is expected to be completed later this summer, with a final report issued by the VA inspector general in August. The report's findings prompted the American Legion to call for a criminal investigation. ""We want every VA employee who participated in these cover-ups to be investigated and prosecuted to the full extent of the law ..."" the veterans group said in a written statement. The U.S. Department of Justice is reviewing the interim report, Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman, said. ""We will continue to consult with the inspector general's office regarding their ongoing review,"" he said. Document: VA audit report released . Calls for Shinseki's resignation . Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, told CNN it was ""about time"" the Justice Department launched its own investigation. ""I haven't said this before, but I think it's time for Gen. Shinseki to move on,"" McCain said. There have been calls from other members of Congress for him to step down over the scandal, but McCain's voice on military matters carries enormous weight considering his experience as a combat veteran, a Vietnam prisoner of war, and his work in the Senate on related issues. Shinseki finds himself in a firestorm . A number of Senate Democrats, all up for re-election this year, also called for Shinseki to leave his post. Among them was Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado who took to Twitter with his message: ""In light of IG report & systemic issues at @DeptVetAffairs, Sec. Shinseki must step down."" Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota said a change in leadership is needed. ""I believe it would be in the best interest of veterans for Secretary Shinseki to step down,"" he said. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire said ""fundamental problems plague the agency."" ""It's time for a forceful new leader to address the outrageous problems at the VA,"" she said. Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken told CNN that President Barack Obama has been briefed on the report, and found it ""deeply troubling."" When pressed on whether Obama still supports Shinseki, Blinken said: ""We're focused on making sure these veterans who've delivered for this country get the care they need."" IG: 'Take immediate action' The VA has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care. The VA's inspector general, Richard Griffin, told a Senate committee in recent weeks that his investigation so far had found a possible 17 deaths of veterans waiting for care in Phoenix, but he added that there was no evidence that excessive waiting was the reason. Griffin recommended that Shinseki ""take immediate action"" to ""review and provide appropriate health care"" to the 1,700 veterans identified in Phoenix as not being on a wait list. It also recommended that he initiate a nationwide review of waiting lists ""to ensure that veterans are seen in an appropriate time, given their clinical condition."" The report came just hours before the start of a combative House committee hearing on the Phoenix VA issues, where Republican and Democratic leaders said they were dissatisfied with the VA's response to their panel's subpoena for documents on shortcomings related at the agency's Phoenix medical center. ""Veterans died. Give us the answers, please,"" Jeff Miller, a Florida Republican, told one of three senior VA officials called to testify. The committee's senior Democrat, Michael Michaud of Maine, was equally sharp with the witnesses, who initially sparred with lawmakers over the agency's response for documents before answering questions about Phoenix. ""Let me be clear, I'm not happy. We do expect answers. We'll get to the bottom of this,"" Michaud said. Dr. Thomas Lynch, the VA's assistant deputy under secretary for clinical operations, told the committee there are plans in place to contact the 1,700 veterans in Phoenix by the close of business on Friday to assess their needs and get them care. Lynch, who said he agreed with the interim report's findings, believes that overarching agency goals for reducing wait times for care are flawed. ""What's happened is unacceptable,"" he said.

"The decision to grant permanent observer status to China and five other nations by the Arctic Council meeting in Sweden Wednesday reflects the heightened interest by some of the world's most powerful economies in an area rich in oil, gas, minerals, fish and new transport possibilities. For new observer nations China, Japan and South Korea, shorter shipping routes to Europe through Arctic waters could open up prospects of new energy supply options later this decade, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Russia's Yamal Peninsula in northwest Siberia. It could also lessen China's dependence on oil and gas shipped from the Middle East, which must pass through the Southeast Asian chokepoint of the Strait of Malacca. Allied to China's interest of getting oil and gas delivered from new pipelines across Myanmar and Central Asia, the potential of the Arctic trade routes loom large in China's strategic thinking. Five years ago, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) described the vast Arctic continental shelf as potentially the ""largest unexplored prospective area for petroleum remaining on Earth."" A new U.S. Arctic policy unveiled by the Obama administration last week cites that 2008 study, which estimated that about 13% of the world's undiscovered oil and 30% of its undiscovered gas lies north of the Arctic Circle. In a 2012 update, the USGS put the mean undiscovered estimate of recoverable oil in Russia's Arctic provinces alone at 28 billion barrels, plus about 27 trillion cubic meters of gas. China is keen to be more than just a customer for this Russian oil and gas. In February, the heads of China's three state-controlled oil and gas majors -- China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), Sinopec and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) -- met one of Russia's most influential players in the energy sector, Igor Sechin, chief executive of state-owned oil company Rosneft. The following month, Rosneft struck a deal with CNPC, giving it access to Arctic resources. The Arctic Council, made up of the United States, Russia, Canada and the five Nordic nations -- Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Iceland -- was set up in 1996 to coordinate policy in a resource-rich but environmentally sensitive part of the world. Before Wednesday's decision there were already six observer states: the UK, France, Germany, Poland, Spain and the Netherlands. Now the permanent observers are being joined by China, Japan, India, South Korea, Singapore and Italy, meaning that all of the key Asian economies now have a seat at the Arctic table, even though they will not have a vote on the Arctic Council. The European Union, the other major body seeking observer status, had its application affirmed but ""deferred,"" a rebuff that is likely related to an unresolved dispute with Canada over the fur seal trade. Both China and India already have polar research stations in the northern part of Norway, as do most of the other observer nations. The Arctic's importance has gained extra strategic and economic significance as melting ice in the polar region strengthens the feasibility of nations to use the Northern Sea Route (NSR) across the top of Russia and the Northwest Passage through Canada's Arctic archipelago. Canada claims the passage, which links the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, runs through its internal waterways. The U.S. and other countries contest this, maintaining it is an international strait. For China, the main transportation focus is the NSR, which runs along the northern coastline of Siberia from Novaya Zemlya to the Bering Strait. It is open only for about five months of the year, from late June to November or early December, and requires icebreakers to cut a path through the Arctic ice for specially strengthened oil and gas carriers. But the route cuts as much as three weeks from shipping times between Europe and Asia. For example, Murmansk to China's Ningbo port near Shanghai is 13,000 km via the NSR, compared with 22,000 km via the Mediterranean Sea, Suez Canal, Indian Ocean and Strait of Malacca. In August to September last year, China sent its one and only icebreaker Xue Long (Snow Dragon) on a successful two-way test run of the NSR. It plans to add a second icebreaker to its fleet in 2014-15. Over the past two sailing seasons, Russian oil and gas companies have tested the route for gas condensate and LNG shipments. In June 2011, Novatek, Russia's biggest non-state gas company, sent 60,000 tons of gas condensate from Murmansk to the Chinese port of Ningbo aboard the MV Perseverance on a three-week voyage. At the end of 2012, Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom sent a 66,000-tonne cargo of LNG from Statoil's Hammerfest terminal in Norway to the Japanese port of Tobata between November 7 and December 5. The route was cleared by three Russian icebreakers. For now, the NSR is still very much in a test phase. According to the Centre for High North Logistics, an Arctic-focused information center based in Kirkenes, Norway, 46 vessels used the NSR in 2012, carrying about 1.26 million tons of cargo. That was an increase of more than 50% from 2011. China envisages exporting consumer goods aboard container ships to Europe and receiving LNG cargoes via the NSR. Novatek, for example, is building a new port at Sabetta on the Yamal peninsula to service the LNG trade to Asia, with expectations of first gas in 2016 and exports of 15 million tons a year by 2018. The NSR's shortcomings are considerable: a short sailing season, the cost of hiring icebreakers, the operational hazards of extreme northern waters and the environmental risks of oil spills, collisions or sinkings. Even so, this Arctic shipping route is likely to be the focus of intense interest by China over the next decade.","Six nations have been granted permanent observer status by the Arctic Council .

"Jerusalem ramped up security after two Palestinian cousins wielding a gun and butcher knives attacked a synagogue during morning prayers, killing four worshipers and a police officer and wounding several others. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed a strong reaction to Tuesday's killings. He characterized the attack, which drew condemnation from around the world, as the result of a ""blood libel"" fanned by Palestinian leaders. Even after Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the attack, Netanyahu said his response was ""not enough."" Addressing reporters Tuesday night, the Israeli Prime Minister called for national unity against ""those human animals who committed this massacre"" and against those -- singling out Hamas and the Palestinian Authority -- who he claimed ""disseminate libels against the state of Israel."" The terror attack -- the deadliest in Jerusalem since 2008 -- came at a particularly tense time in region. It follows recent deadly stabbings and vehicle attacks which, while not the same as the large-scale suicide bombings that defined last decade's second intifada, have left Jerusalem on edge. At the heart of the unrest is the holy site in the Old City of Jerusalem, known as the Temple Mount by Jews and Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary) by Muslims. Pope Francis condemned the attack and said he's praying for the region. ""From the bottom of my heart, I appeal to all the parties involved to put an end to the spiral of hatred and violence, and to take courageous decisions for reconciliation and peace,"" the Pope said. ""To build peace is difficult but to live without it is torment."" Who were the victims? Gruesome scene . Photos taken after the attack Tuesday inside the synagogue in West Jerusalem's Har Nof area, and released by Israeli officials, showed a grim scene. Lifeless bodies sprawled on the floor; a shattered pair of glasses; holy books, prayer shawls and walls soaked with blood. The pictures did not relay the full scope of the brutality. ""It was much worse,"" Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said. Three dual U.S.-Israeli citizens and a British-Israeli citizen died in the attack before police shot and killed the two assailants. The four victims were all rabbis, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said. Hours after the attack, a policeman who was shot during the rampage while pulling a woman to safety died from his wounds, a hospital official said. The four worshipers killed were Avraham Shmuel Goldberg, 58; Aryeh Kupinsky, 43; Moshe Twersky, 59; and Kalman Levine, 55. Goldberg was a dual British-Israeli citizen, and the other three were U.S.-Israeli citizens. ""When four great men, wonderful men, wise in Torah study, are slaughtered while praying in public, there is no public grieving greater than that,"" said a rabbi who eulogized the men later Tuesday, before their burial. Seven others were wounded, including three who were seriously hurt, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry. One of the wounded is a Canadian-Israeli dual citizen who was stabbed in his head, eyes and arms, CNN partner network CTV reported. Howard Rothman, 53, formerly of Toronto, was in a medically induced coma Tuesday, according to CTV. ""He was trying to fight off the attackers. He's in a coma -- he's in critical condition,"" Toby Trumpter-Kraman, a family friend, told CTV. Jerusalem terror attack 'strikes at soul' of Jews worldwide . Order to demolish attackers' homes . Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat -- whose city is about two-thirds Jewish and one-third Arab -- said the synagogue attack was incited by Hamas and terrorist organizations who use ""rumor and misfacts"" about how Palestinians are treated in the city. The Palestinian news agency Ma'an identified the two attackers as Ghassan Abu Jamal and his cousin, Udayy. While no group claimed responsibility for the attack, Israeli officials say the attackers came from East Jerusalem, where Palestinians can move more freely about the city than those living in the West Bank and Gaza, who must pass through stringent checkpoints. Israeli authorities moved into the attackers' East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabel Mukaber to demolish their homes on Netanyahu's order. The Palestinians' official WAFA news agency reported 13 people were arrested. Witnesses said that early Wednesday, Israeli security forces destroyed the home of a Palestinian man who drove his car into a light rail station last month, killing a baby. Mark Regev, Netanyahu's spokesman, said authorities were beefing up security around Jerusalem after Tuesday's attack. ""We've got to make sure there are no copycat attacks,"" Regev said. ""We also want to make sure that there's no hothead on the Israeli side who decides he wants to take the law into his own hands and conduct a vigilante counter attack."" The U.S. consulate in Jerusalem warned Americans that disturbances in East Jerusalem were possible. ""While we cannot predict where and when attacks may take place, we have consistently seen a cycle of violence in East Jerusalem neighborhoods following incidents like the one today,"" the consulate said Tuesday on its website. Experts: No third intifada yet -- but little hope, either . Netanyahu accuses Palestinian leaders of 'incitement' Netanyahu accused the Palestinian Authority of inciting violence, although he hedged his words about its leader. ""(Abbas) does not send out terrorists, he doesn't directly encourage acts of terror, and this is good,"" Netanyahu said, echoing an assessment by an Israeli security chief. ""On the other hand, the incitement of the Palestinian Authority -- and he heads the Palestinian Authority -- and even some things he says ... encourage terrorism, in terms of incitement (of) tensions that run high."" There was no such equivocation about Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza. It's been at odds with Israel and also with Abbas' Fatah movement, which controls the West Bank. Hamas did not claim responsibility for the synagogue attack, though it didn't back away from it either. Sami Abu Zuhri, a spokesman for the group, instead linked the attack to the discovery Sunday of a Palestinian bus driver hanged in his bus not far from where Tuesday's attack occurred. Israeli authorities say the bus driver's death was a suicide, but his family disputes that, claiming he was attacked. Senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad predicted to Al Jazeera International that ""there will be more revolution in Jerusalem, and more uprising.""

"(CNN) -- In the many media stories about the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, much of the focus has rightly been on the thousands of foreign fighters ISIS has attracted, its brutal tactics and its robust social media presence. But an arguably even more important development has not received the attention it deserves: the group's widening influence across the Muslim world, driven by the numerous terrorist and insurgent organizations that have recently sworn loyalty to it. In the past six months, ISIS has drawn into its fold some dozen groups from Algeria to Pakistan. Al Qaeda, in contrast, had been in existence for a decade before it recruited its first affiliate, Egypt's Jihad Group, in 1998. And, in its 2ÃÂ½-decade existence, al Qaeda has only manged to add some half dozen affiliates, one of which was al Qaeda in Iraq, the parent organization of ISIS that has now split off from the core al Qaeda organization. Indeed, just this week, an ISIS delegation met with leaders of a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban to talk about how to unify Pakistani militants, The Associated Press reported. Also this month, Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, one of the most violent militant groups in Egypt, pledged allegiance to ISIS, The New York Times reported. ABM is believed to have been responsible for an attack on a police checkpoint near Gaza last month that killed 30 Egyptian soldiers. And ISIS has continued to expand its geographical reach. Three other groups -- al-Mujahidin in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Mujahidin in Libya and al-Mujahidin in Yemen -- also recorded statements of allegiance to ISIS in November, which ISIS broadcast online. Meanwhile, ISIS now controls the eastern Libyan city of Derna, not far from the Egyptian border. And last month, six Pakistani Taliban leaders reportedly swore allegiance to ISIS in an audio message, although Shahidullah Shahid, the Pakistani Taliban's official spokesman, said he was speaking for himself and five other Taliban leaders in the message, not for the rest of the Pakistani Taliban. The Taliban reacted by firing Shahid, but a senior Taliban official told the BBC that ""he was the most important of the five who have left us"" and said that the leaders had defected because they were unhappy with senior Taliban leaders. Among other groups that have pledged allegiance to ISIS is Jund al-Khalifa (Soldiers of the Caliphate), a terrorist group operating in Algeria. Previously, the group was part of al Qaeda's North African branch, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, until the group split from AQIM because it was ""deviating from the true path."" And just 10 days after proclaiming its allegiance to ISIS, Jund al-Khalifa beheaded Herve Gourdel, a 55-year-old French hiker they had taken hostage. (Beheading Western hostages is, of course, one of ISIS' signature tactics). Inside Syria and Iraq, ISIS has also gathered up smaller militant groups. For example, Ansar al-Islam, a former al Qaeda-linked group, is now cooperating with ISIS. Also, Jaysh Mohammed (Army of Mohammed) used to work to repel U.S. forces from Iraq and has now joined the ranks of ISIS. Finally, ISIS and the al Qaeda-aligned Nusra Front had previously been at war with each other in Syria for much of this past year. But this month, representatives from the two groups met in Syria and agreed to stop fighting each other and focus on fighting their common enemies, sources told The Associated Press. This brings together the two most effective Sunni militant groups fighting in Syria. Why are all of these militant groups suddenly pledging their allegiance to ISIS or aligning themselves with the group, and in many cases giving up former affiliations with al Qaeda's core group to do so? The answer is simple: ISIS is successful. In many ways it really is the ""Islamic State of Iraq and Syria"" that it claims to be, because it has taken large portions of both countries from government control, replacing local administrators with ISIS governors who distribute social services. ISIS is also winning critical cities and key points of infrastructure, including dams and oil wells, and that means the group has substantial funding and resources at its disposal. Partnering with ISIS makes sense from an economic perspective for many of these organizations, especially the smaller militant groups operating inside Syria and Iraq. For other militant groups around the Muslim world, it allows for a cross-pollination of ideas and training through a sort of jihadist exchange program, where some groups send members into Syria or Iraq to learn from ISIS. ISIS controls territory in a 400-mile swath from Aleppo in the west of Syria to Fallujah in the east, near the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, while its dozen or so affiliated organizations stretch from the coast of North Africa to the mountains of the Hindu Kush. The fact is that al Qaeda's core organization can only dream of such success.","Peter Bergen: More and more terrorist and insurgent groups are swearing loyalty to ISIS .

"""I have five days to recover from surgery and look good before my husband gets home."" Marina, a 60-year-old Caucasian woman, sits before me to sign the consent forms for her upcoming operations: a 3-D face-lift, upper and lower eyelid lifts and an endoscopic brow lift. I see on her information sheet that she hasn't authorized us to discuss her surgeries with anyone else -- not even her husband. ""So you're not telling him about all these procedures?"" ""Not unless I have to. You don't know him. He wouldn't understand, and he wouldn't want me to spend all this money, especially on something he thinks is frivolous. So that's why I need to look good before he gets back. We've got five days, Dr. Youn."" Cosmetic surgery has become a new form of infidelity -- for both men and women. As the number of people having plastic surgery rises, more and more feel the need to hide their procedures from their significant others. In fact, we did a survey of cosmetic patients in my office and found that one-third don't tell their partners about their treatments. Hard to believe? While surgery can be difficult to hide, especially large operations with dramatic changes such as tummy tucks and face-lifts, less-invasive procedures such as Botox and filler injections aren't as hard to conceal. Body modification -- or mutilation? The first step many patients take is to hide how much they're spending. According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, the average cost of Botox is $392, and the average cost of Juvederm is $675 -- pretty hefty amounts to cover up. So how do they do it? Some patients pay with cash. Others split it up and pay half in cash, half in credit. Many of my patients have a certain threshold that they can spend on their credit card before their partner notices the individual charge. This amount usually ranges between $100 and $400. Often the patient will spend up to that amount on a credit card, then pay the rest in cash. Other patients spread small amounts over several credit cards. Timing the procedure strategically is another way people hide their cosmetic treatments. Many patients, like Marina, have their surgeries done while their spouses are out of town. They use this alone time to recover, so that when their spouses return, they're none the wiser. For less-invasive treatments, such as lasers and injections, many patients have the procedures performed on days when their partners have plans after work. This way, they have all night to let the swelling subside. When their spouse sees them the next day, they look normal again. You don't want a jack-of-all-trades surgeon . Some women also take advantage of the fact that their men just aren't that perceptive. Men are notoriously bad at noticing changes in their spouses. In fact, a 2004 study in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin found that women are much better than men at remembering appearances. I am as bad as any. It can take me days to notice that my wife has changed her hair. So what happened with Marina? She underwent all four surgeries, with the hope that she'd look good enough five days later to prevent her husband from noticing the dramatic changes in her face. She stopped by the office to see me several hours before her husband was to return home. Marina was a hot mess. Her eyes looked like she went 10 rounds with Mike Tyson, her neck was taut as a pair of Spanx, and her lips resembled two Vienna sausages. ""Wow, Marina. You're still quite puffy and bruised, but give it another week or two and you'll look fantastic,"" I told her. ""However, I'm not sure your plan to hide your plastic surgery from your husband is going to work."" ""Dr. Youn,"" she deadpanned. ""You don't know my husband."" He never figured it out.","Cosmetic surgery has become a new form of infidelity, plastic surgeon says .

"Hillary Clinton is defending President Barack Obama's decision to extend talks with Iran over dismantling its nuclear program. ""I think it is a very important effort to continue to pursue, and to try to see if we can reach an agreement that is in line with our requirements,"" Clinton said Friday night. But she called for a tough approaching in the talks that were recently extended for seven more months, saying she is ""strongly of the view that no deal is better than a bad deal."" ""A deal that verifiably closes all of Iran's pathways to a nuclear weapon -- and the key there is verifiably, and all, including covert efforts -- that is what is at the center of this negotiation,"" Clinton said. ""And I think, one might say remarkably, our partners have not jumped ship. They have stayed in the negotiation."" Her comments came during an hour-long question-and-answer session with Haim Saban, a major Democratic donor, in an event hosted by the Brookings Institution. Clinton has claimed credit for starting those talks with Iran during her tenure as President Barack Obama's Secretary of State -- and the issue could remain a hot topic if, as is widely expected, she seeks the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. Republicans have criticized the Obama administration's handling of the Iran talks, and have argued that they'd advance legislation to impede any deal that would allow Iran to continue to enrich uranium. Clinton said she wishes she had ""spoken out more"" during the so-called Green Revolution after the 2009 elections in Iran. She said the State Department urged Twitter to hold off on a maintenance update because the social media tool provided a communications channel that was fueling protests there. Iran is not the only issue where Clinton refused to distance herself from the Obama administration that came up Friday night. She backed the Obama administration on Israel -- a traditional ally with which tensions have been strained following White House warnings about civilian casualties in Gaza, and an Obama administration official, quoted anonymously, referred to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as ""chickens---.""

"A 29-year-old Virginia woman charged with lying to the FBI about alleged connections to the terror group ISIS will remain in jail until her trial. Heather Coffman of Henrico County, Virginia, stood quietly in federal court in Richmond on Wednesday, where she waived her right to a detention hearing and a preliminary hearing. Coffman, mother of a 7-year-old son, is accused of trying to help people go to Syria to take up arms with ISIS. No court date was set at the hearing Wednesday for Coffman, who was dressed in a navy-blue jailhouse jumpsuit and bright orange rubber shoes, her brown hair unkempt and her face emotionless. Authorities say they built their case against Coffman over several months using information from a series of undercover interviews and social media posts.  Coffman first caught the attention of the FBI through her Facebook activity, according to a criminal complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Investigators say Coffman, using the name Ubeida Ametova, listed her ""work and education"" on her Facebook account as ""jihad for Allah's sake"" and posted images of ISIS fighters armed with AK-47s with captions including, ""We are all ISIS"" and ""Virtues of the Mujahideen."" Investigators say they also discovered a man whom Coffman claimed was her husband. According to Facebook communications detailed in the complaint, the man told Coffman he hoped their future son would be ""Mujahideen"" and Coffman agreed, expressing her support for ""whatever you want to do."" Several of Coffman's neighbors told CNN there were indications she was increasingly observant of the Muslim faith but they saw no signs she was radicalized.  They say they noticed a change in Coffman's appearance about three months ago when she started wearing black burqas and headscarves. Neighbor Adrian Ford said she found it ""strange"" when Coffman started wearing a burqa because she used to wear T-shirts and jeans. Authorities say it was information gathered by an undercover FBI agent during a series of interviews with Coffman that led to the charges against her. Starting in July, an agent posing as an ISIS sympathizer routinely met with Coffman and began to investigate her recruitment network. After establishing a relationship, the undercover agent told Coffman about an associate who shared their views on Islam and was prepared to join the fight with ISIS in Syria, according to the criminal complaint. Federal agents say Coffman revealed she had experience connecting potential recruits with ISIS facilitators. The undercover agent met with Coffman three times, on November 5, 6 and 7, according to officials, who said she again offered to help find a contact and facilitate travel into Syria. On November 13, two FBI agents met with Coffman at her work and interviewed her. Investigators say she lied when she denied the undercover agent ever expressed support for ISIS or similar terrorist groups. She was arrested the next day and charged with lying to the FBI. Her attorneys and federal prosecutors all declined to comment to CNN.","Heather Coffman is accused to trying to help people go to Syria to fight with ISIS .

"(CNN)Not one, but two French citizens have been connected to beheadings in a recent ISIS video, both of them 22-year-old men who went to Syria to join the group, authorities said Wednesday. The Paris prosecutor's office on Wednesday identified Mickael Dos Santos, a convert to Islam from the Paris suburb of Champigny-sur-Marne who was well-known to French anti-terror authorities before the ISIS video release. Why are so many young French turning to jihad? In fact, an October 2013 warrant for Dos Santos' arrest was issued as part of an investigation into French citizens who had gone to Syria to take part in ISIS jihad there, the prosecutor's office said. Dos Santos joins Maxime Hauchard, who authorities said Monday was also on the video, released over the weekend, that depicts in graphic detail, the beheadings of men whom ISIS militants claim were Syrian government pilots. It also shows the aftermath of another beheading in which the victim in not clearly recognizable, but that the U.S. government says was American aid worker Peter Kassig. Public Prosecutor Francois Molins described Hauchard -- who went to Syria in 2013 and visiting Mauritania the previous year -- is a ""self-radicalized"" jihadist who traveled to the region under the guise of a humanitarian mission. He was known to French security services as far back as 2011, the prosecutor said. More barbaric ISIS videos expected after Kassig's death, analyst says . Speaking from Australia alongside Prime Minister Tony Abbott, French President FranÃÂ§ois Hollande said his country's judicial system will work to establish ""exactly what role"" the two French men played, though the mere fact they came from France and became involved at all warrants attention and action. ""We have to be even more aware, even in terms of the information that needs to be handed out, in terms of the danger that Internet sites carry and how these young people can be indoctrinated,"" Hollande said. ""They could be from any background, from any ethnic origin, but they easily can be brainwashed into becoming converts."" The ranks of ISIS -- the extremist group calling itself the Islamic State that's taken over vast swaths of Syria and Iraq -- have swelled with volunteers coming from outside the region, including from the West. How foreign fighters are bolstering ISIS . Intelligence estimates indicate that more than 100 of the foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria have come from the United States. Hundreds more arrived from Europe, including more than 900 French citizens that country's government believes are involved in the jihad there. This influx has spurred concerns that some of these fighters could bring the fight back home, perhaps with attacks inside Western nations. Those worries have been heightened by the group's brutal tactics against foe and civilians alike, such as raping, enslaving and selling Iraqi women belonging to the Yazidi religious minority.  Last week, a United Nations panel stated what many consider obvious:  ISIS has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria. Yazidi women 'treated like cattle' The most high-profile of these abuses -- because they were taped and publicized as propaganda, for all the world to see -- have been the beheadings of ISIS captives. The mother of the first American so killed, journalist James Foley, said that her family is in touch with Kassig's family and that they are ""heartbroken another American has given his life for the suffering people of Syria."" The West is fighting back, with many countries -- including France -- allying with Iraq to conduct airstrikes targeting ISIS in that country. The United States has also led airstrikes going after the group in Syria. From Monday to Wednesday, for instance, the U.S.-led coalition launched five airstrikes near the northern Syrian city of Kobani and one targeting an oil collection point in al-Hasakah, in addition to a strike targeting a facility purportedly used by the so-called Khorasan Group. There were even more strikes in Iraq, including 13 near Kirkuk, seven near Mosul, three near Baiji and one near Fallujah, according to the U.S. military. OPINION: Kassig's murder a sign of weakness from a terror group on the run . ISIS hasn't relented much either, including unleashing yet more violence Wednesday. At least four people died and 29 others were wounded after a vehicle drove up to the entrance to a government building in Irbil, the strongly fortified capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, and exploded, according to Kurdistan Regional Government spokesman Safeen Dizayee. Police ""who tried to stop"" the vehicle were among the dead, he said. Dizayee added that ISIS -- which is active in northern Iraq -- claimed responsibility for the attack. Meanwhile, fighting continues in Syria as well, some of it near the Turkish border. John Allen, the former commander of American forces in Afghanistan now charged with coordinating the coalition to battle ISIS, met with officials in the Turkish capital of Ankara about that fight on Wednesday. The same day, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for more to be done -- including establishing no-fly zones and bolstering ""train and equip"" efforts for those fighting ISIS. Turkey has spoken out against ISIS, while also expressing opposition to groups of Kurdish fighters that are among those trying to defeat the group. ""The coalition powers still have not taken these steps we asked for and recommended,"" Erdogan said, according to a report from the semi-official Anadolu news agency. ""We are living this process on small hints and possibilities.""

"(CNN) -- A Turkish passenger jet crashed as it tried to land at Amsterdam's main airport Wednesday, killing at least nine people and injuring more than 55, Dutch airport authorities have said. Rescuers attend the fuselage of the Turkish Airlines Boeing 737-800 following Wednesday's crash. The Turkish Airlines Boeing 737-800, which had 127 passengers and seven crew members according to the airline, broke into three pieces on impact in a field near Schiphol Airport. The injured included both crew and passengers, said acting mayor of Haarlemmermeer municipality Michel Bezuijen. The flight data and voice recorders have been recovered, he said, but investigators still need to determine what, if anything, the pilots said in the moments before the crash. A news photographer at the scene said she saw an unknown number of bodies lying under a white blanket, Maaike Voersma, a journalist with Dutch newspaper De Pers, told CNN. A passenger on the plane who spoke to Turkish network DHA said he saw injured people trapped and squeezed between the seats when he walked off the plane. iReport: Send your videos, stories . Flight 1951, which originated from Istanbul, Turkey, was trying to land at Schiphol when it went down at about 10:40 a.m. local time (4:40 a.m. ET), Dutch airport officials said. At least three crew were among the dead. ""There are still three crew members in the cabin,"" said Bob Steensma of the Dutch Justice Department. ""I'm sorry to say they are dead. We leave them there because we have to investigate the cockpit before we take the cockpit apart."" All the passengers, however, had been removed from the plane as of about 5 p.m., officials said. Roads around the crash site had been blocked to traffic. Six people were critically injured, Ineke Van Der Zande of Amsterdam Emergency Services told reporters at a briefing. Twenty-five passengers were severely injured, she said, and 24 others were lightly injured. The conditions of the other 31 people were not immediately known, she said. Some 60 ambulances transported 84 people to 11 hospitals throughout the region, she said. Witnesses said they saw the nose of the plane pitch up suddenly before the crash, according to RTL journalist Greg Crouch. The plane was broken in three pieces. One tear was in front of the wing, splitting the ""Turkish"" logo in two, and a larger tear was farther back along the fuselage.  See where the plane crashed Â» . Most of the injured were seated toward the back of the plane, which sustained the most damage, a passenger on the plane told Turkish station NTV. Many of the passengers simply walked off the plane through the cracks in the fuselage, witnesses told NTV. Medics treated passengers on the ground next to the buckled hulk of the plane, while firefighters and police examined the aircraft.  See rescuers attend the crash scene Â» . Emergency exits were wide open and there was no signs of fire damage to the fuselage. Also visible was one of the aircraft's engines, apparently separated from the shattered remains of one of the wings. The plane landed in a farmer's field near the airport, RTL journalist Greg Crouch told CNN. He said the weather at the time was partly sunny with no wind or rain.  Watch iReport on crash wreckage Â» . Witnesses said they saw the nose of the plane pitch up suddenly before the crash, Crouch said. A bank manager who was a passenger on the plane told NTV that there were no emergency announcements. The crew's last word to the cabin was an announcement to fasten seatbelts and prepare for landing, the bank manager said. He said he felt the pilot giving more power to the engines before feeling ""turbulence,"" then a sudden drop. He described the crash as similar to a sudden impact that was over in a matter of seconds.  Watch report on survivors describing ""turbulence"" Â» . The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said it is sending a team of investigators to Amsterdam to assist in the crash investigation. Kieran Daly, of Air Transport Intelligence said the impact had been severe but it could have been survivable because of the lack of fire. He added that there had been vast improvements in the materials used to build airplanes, meaning they did not burn as easily.  Watch aviation expert comment on Amsterdam crash Â» . Daly also said that the Boeing 737-800 is a reliable aircraft that has been successful and safe in service. ""They really are pretty much state-of-the-art airliners with every imaginable technical benefit the industry has come up with over the years,"" Daly told CNN. ""You would be optimistic that they would be quite survivable in an accident."" Daly said the Turkish aviation industry has a ""pretty good record"" of safety, and that Turkish Airlines, the national carrier, has a ""very good record."" Turkish Airlines said it has 52 Boeing 737-800s in its fleet. They can carry up to 165 passengers each, the airline said. The airline's last accident was of a small commuter jet in 2003, he said. It was a fatal crash that happened at a remote airfield in eastern Turkey, he said. ""Their mainline operation is safe,"" Daly said. ""Their pilots are well thought of."" The last accident at Schiphol Airport happened in December 2003 when an EasyJet flight carrying 103 passengers to London collided while with a lamppost while taxiing during icy conditions, according to Aviation Safety Network's Web site. The crash caused significant damage to the aircraft, but no one was killed. The last fatal incident at the Amsterdam airport happened in April 1994 when a KLM aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff as it tried to return to Schiphol.

"(CNN) -- Israelis woke up on Tuesday to horrifying news: four men, three of them in their 50s, had been slain while they were chanting their morning prayers at a synagogue in the West Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof. The perpetrators were two young Palestinian men from East Jerusalem, who attacked with butcher knives and guns. The extensive media coverage included gruesome images of a synagogue chapel with blood splattered on the walls, pooled and streaked on the floor. And sprawled on those blood-pooled floors were the corpses of gray-haired men covered in their blood-stained prayer shawls, the leather straps of their phylacteries still wound around their lifeless arms. Several public figures, from prominent politicians and commentators to the founder of a volunteer rescue service, said the images reminded them of the Holocaust. The subtext seemed to be that murder was bad enough, but murdering people at prayer was an act of unprecedented barbarity. Unfortunately, though, Tuesday's horror was not unprecedented. Political violence is a grim fact of life in this part of the world, and it is committed by both Jews and Arabs. In 1994, for example, a Jewish Israeli man named Baruch Goldstein entered a Hebron mosque armed with a machine gun. He opened fire on a room full of men at prayer, killing 29 of them. In recent months and years, Jewish settlers have vandalized several mosques by setting them alight or tagging them with nationalist slogans in spray paint. Jerusalem has been simmering since June, with one act of horrific political violence followed by another. First three Jewish teenage boys were abducted and killed by Hebron-area men affiliated with Hamas. Then three Israeli Jews were charged with abducting a teenage Palestinian boy from East Jerusalem and killing him by burning him alive in a nearby forest. In response, there were Palestinian street protests, which Israeli paramilitary police answered with tear gas, rubber-coated bullets, beatings and predawn arrests. Then came a series of so-called ""lone wolf"" attacks, committed by individual Palestinians who attacked random Israelis by stabbing them or ramming them with vehicles in deliberate hit-and-runs. For weeks, friends who live in neighborhoods abutting East Jerusalem, a primarily Palestinian area, have reported via social media that the sound of gunfire has become a nocturnal experience. One of the many depressing aspects of the endless Jewish-Palestinian conflict is the rush to engage in moral one-upmanship. While it is absolutely undeniable that only one party in this conflict has a powerful army and heavy-hitting diplomatic allies (that would be Israel), neither side has superior morality or redder blood. Yes, there is context to the violence. But no, it is not the Holocaust, and we must resist the populist politicians and commentators who frame the latest deaths as having been committed in the name of hatred of Jews, rather than as an outrageous act of politically motivated violence. Of course, the fact that this attack has both context and precedent does not make it any less horrifying. But those who ignore the context of this violence are also denying an essential element of this: that Palestinians in East Jerusalem are in a state of despair and hopelessness as a result of Israel's policies. The reality is that if the Israeli government fails to address legitimate Palestinian grievances while portraying them simply as monsters rather than human beings, the situation in the world's most contested city will continue to deteriorate.","Tuesday's horrific attack in Jerusalem not unprecedented, says Lisa Goldman .
Jerusalem tensions have been simmering since June, Goldman says .

"Chinese state media has called the Philippine president ""ignorant"" and ""amateurish"" after he compared Beijing's pursuit of disputed territory in the South China Sea with the rise of Nazi Germany. A scathing commentary released by news agency Xinhua Wednesday said Benigno Aquino ""had never been a great candidate for a wise statesman in the region."" The comments came after Aquino called for the world to do more to support the Philippines in resisting China's claims, drawing a comparison to the West's failure to support Czechoslovakia against Hitler's demands for Czech lands in 1938. ""At what point do you say 'Enough is enough?' Well the world has to say it -- remember that Sudentenland was given in an attempt to appease Hitler to prevent World War II,"" Benigno told the New York Times in an interview. In the riposte, Xinhua said the ""senseless attack"" exposed ""his true color as an amateurish politician who was ignorant of both history and reality."" It's not the first time that an Asian leader has invoked the build-up to a world war to depict tensions over territorial claims in the region. At the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe raised eyebrows when he drew a parallel between the current state of relations between Japan and China and that of Britain and Germany before the start of World War I a century ago. Xinhua said that despite the ""lame comparisons"" made by Japan and the Philippines,  China had chosen a path of peaceful development and its territorial claims in the South China Sea have a ""sound historical foundation."" The maritime area is home to messy mix of rival claims, with China, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam disputing sovereignty of island chains and nearby waters. The Philippines and China both say that Scarborough Shoal, about 200 kilometers west of the Philippines mainland, is ""an integral part"" of their territory. China, Japan and South Korea also dispute sovereignty of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea. The areas in dispute include fertile fishing grounds and potentially rich reserves of undersea natural resources.","State media calls the Philippine president ""ignorant"" and ""amateurish""

"As world powers are gathering in Vienna this week for a final round of nuclear talks with Iran, Western diplomats put their chances of a comprehensive deal at 50 percent at best and a breakthrough before the Nov. 24 deadline appears highly unlikely. While an accord might not be met by next Monday's deadline, diplomats say it is possible to agree on the outline of a deal. They say an extension of the talks to resolve the remaining issues and work out the details is the most likely scenario. Though nobody is talking publicly yet about the prospects for an extension, one senior administration official said a continuation of the talks was far preferable to a total collapse of the process. ""We are striving for a final deal, but if that doesn't happen, do we walk away and throw away all of the progress that has been made over these nine months,"" the official asked rhetorically. ""We just can't do that."" The parties have been tight-lipped about the details of the negotiations, most of which are highly technical. While diplomatic sources say progress has been made on all issues, the main sticking points continue to center around Iran's uranium enrichment capacity and the pace at which decades long sanctions against Tehran would be lifted in exchange for intrusive inspections and curbs on its program. A deal would help end decades of mutual mistrust between Iran and the West, paving the way for better relations and potential cooperation. But failure could lead to an unwanted military confrontation in a region already wracked by violence, instability and political chaos. Negotiations are aimed at reconfiguring Iran's nuclear program in an effort to extend the time Iran would have enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon, otherwise known as the ""breakout time."" Experts say at present it could take Iran as little as three months. The six world powers want to extend that to at least a year, giving the international community time to intervene. As the number of outstanding issues has dwindled, the differences over the remaining ones have grown sharper. Diplomats caution nothing is truly agreed to until everything is hammered out -- comparing the negotiations to a complex ""Rubix Cube""-like puzzle. Take Iran's enrichment program. A key component of extending Iran's breakout time centers around limiting the amount of enriched uranium Iran is able to produce and keep on hand. The U.S. and its allies have demanded major cuts in the amount of centrifuges Iran can keep to enrich uranium. At the onset of negotiations, Iran demanded to keep all 19,000 of its centrifuges, while the US and its allies wanted to cut the number to as low as 1,500. Now diplomats say the six world powers are prepared to accept around 4,500 centrifuges. That's still far from the roughly 8 to 10,000 Iran seems prepared to accept. But that magic number of centrifuges is also dependent on an agreement by Iran to reduce its stockpile of already-enriched uranium. Diplomats say Iran has indicated a willingness to ship much of its estimated 28,000 pounds of enriched uranium to Russia, where it would be converted into nuclear fuel for civilian usage. This would also help to extend Iran's breakout time and could unlock the stalemate over how many centrifuges Iran can keep. Another goal is to prevent Iran from acquiring enough plutonium to give it a second route a nuclear bomb through its heavy water reactor at Arak. The reactor was under construction, but work stopped in this past January under the interim deal reached between Iran and the six world powers. If fully operational, the reactor could reprocess fuel into plutonium. Diplomats say proposals have been introduced to ""modify"" the plant to prevent plutonium from ever being produced. One option under discussion involves converting the plant into a light water reactor which could be used for civilian purposes. Adding to doubts about a final deal are charges by the UN's nuclear watchdog that Iran has not handed over past research on the military dimension of its nuclear program. World powers want the International Atomic Energy Agency to conclusively rule on whether Iran has worked on designing an atomic bomb. Iran denies the charges, saying its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes. But a recent IAEA report, obtained by CNN, said that Iran has failed to address the suspicions by explaining its activity on high explosives testing and other nuclear activity. Despite a pledge in May to Iran come clean with the IAEA about the activity, the report said Iran ""has not provided any explanations that enable the agency to clarify"" the outstanding questions. Iran has demanded an immediate lifting of all sanctions once a deal is struck, while American and European diplomats want a gradual lifting of sanctions once Iran demonstrates it is adhering to its end of the deal. The duration of the deal is also in dispute -- Iran wants a settlement of all issues after five years, but world powers are calling for at least ten. A senior U.S. administration official briefing reporters ahead of the talks predicted that neither Iran's supreme leader nor the six world powers would reveal their actual bottom line until the eleventh hour. ""We are at a very, very difficult point in this negotiation,"" she said. ""We all knew that tough decisions -- the toughest decisions -- would not be taken 'til the end, and that is likely to be the case, if they can be taken at all."" While an accord might not be within reach by next Monday's deadline, diplomats say it is possible to agree on an outline. President Barack Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani face domestic political pressure to strike a deal. An extension could sharpen opposition both in the U.S. and in Iran. Republicans take control of the Senate in January and lawmakers have threatened fresh sanctions on Iran if a deal is not reached. Although Obama has the power to veto, just the prospect of additional sanctions could drive Iran away from the table. Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, the lead Iranian negotiator, are under fire from conservatives and lawmakers who were skeptical of the interim deal and have said a final agreement must be ratified by parliament. Earlier this month 200 Iranian members of parliament signed a statement demanding that Iranian negotiators ""vigorously defend"" the country's nuclear rights and ensure a ""total lifting of sanctions"". As the clock ticks down, western diplomats say a deal will hinge on an Iranian political decision that needs to happen this week. ""We don't think any side wants to walk away,"" one Western diplomat said. ""But we need to make the Iranians understand that, yes, we want a deal and we are prepared to work hard at getting one, but not at any cost. There are red lines we can't cross, and if there isn't enough progress by next week, what will change?"" Iran, too, is making clear it has red lines. Arriving in Vienna for the talks, Zarif said a deal hinged on the political will of the West, making clear Iran would ""be resisting excessive demands"" in the final negotiating sessions. ""We are here to find a solution that respects the Iranian nation's rights and removes the legitimate concerns of the international community,"" he said. Despite the posturing on both sides, diplomats did not rule out the potential for a surprise eleventh hour deal, just as negotiators announced an interim deal to continue negotiations in the final hours of talks last year. ""Big rabbits got pulled of small hats last time,"" one Western diplomat said. ""I would never say never.""","Talks between Western diplomats and Iran regarding its nuclear program are showing progress .

"The 119 acres of St. Peter's Cemetery lie blanketed by the season's first snowfall. A hush fills the air; the only sound is the wind blowing accumulated snow, like confectioners' sugar, off the branches of nearly bare trees. I enter through the gate on Lucas and Hunt Road, thinking back to a decidedly different day in late August. The sun was bright and hot for late summer. The verdant oaks and elms soared to the sky. I have written down the grave I am seeking: Section 10, Block F, Lot 12, Grave 4. Inside the cemetery office, I inquire how to find this particular grave in this vast space. An employee looks at the number scribbled in my reporter's notebook. ""Oh."" I look at him, not knowing at first what to make of his reaction. From behind the counter, he whips out a photocopied flier. ""You're looking for Michael Brown, right?"" I nod, yes, and glance at the flier. It's a cemetery map. I see Brown's name and a hand-drawn line pointing to the lot where he is buried. The fliers became necessary because so many visitors asked the same question I did. Several have already been here today, says the man behind the counter. Even in this cold. I head down St. Peter's Drive to the intersection of Hickory, just as the man instructed. I see why a marked map is necessary. There are rows and rows of graves. The sections are not marked, and the headstones are low and not that distinctive. I am searching for something that says his name: Michael Brown. Such a common name, I think. How many Michael Browns do I know? At least six that I can recall in an instant. But I cannot find him. I study the flier, fluttering in the frigid wind, and discern that he is somewhere between others whose names are marked on the map. Bradley. Wilder. Hamilton. Then, I see the footprints, fresh on the snow. The rest of the field is pristine, but there has been a flurry of foot traffic here. I follow the footprints to a small bouquet of plastic flowers, red and purple, planted in the ground. There is not yet a headstone at Brown's grave. I stand where Brown's parents wailed as their son's casket was lowered on August 25 into a copper vault. Sixteen days before, he had been shot dead by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson. One minute, the 18-year-old stood 6 feet 4. The next, he fell to the ground on Canfield Drive. His blood colored the dull asphalt. He lay there for four hours. Photos of his body on social media heightened the anger over a police officer's killing of an unarmed black teenager. Brown became a symbol. What #Ferguson stands for . We all know what happened in the days and weeks afterward. What a contrast there is between those days and this one. Hot against cold. Fury against calm. A tale of two streets in Ferguson . A black hearse carried Brown's gold and black casket through the streets of St. Louis on that late August day. A white horse-drawn wagon delivered him to his final resting place. A photograph taken after everyone was gone shows a spot in the field where grass was disturbed and the dirt turned and showered with a burst of red and white roses. Now nothing remains but the plastic flowers. Almost three long months have passed. Ferguson is not resolved. It's her Ferguson -- and it's not all black and white . What would Brown think if he could see what is happening in his name today? Perhaps he would approve of the demands for justice and calls for reform. But how would he feel about the violent protests? About the way his hometown, just a few miles from here, waits with fear and anxiety for a grand jury decision? His name was so ordinary. His headstone, I presume, will make it a tiny bit less so: Michael O.D. Brown. That's what the copper vault said. But through death, his life turned out to be anything but ordinary. Michael O.D. Brown's exit from this world unleashed a seething anger and sparked a new conversation about an age-old problem. Some people believe him to be a thug who shoved the clerk at the Ferguson Market and Liquor and then stole Swisher Sweets cigars. Some people believe he provoked Wilson, the police officer. But those who make the pilgrimage to his grave site, I imagine, see him another way. As a loving son, a brother. Or perhaps as a hero, a martyr of sorts. I wonder what else his headstone might say. Standing at his grave, I feel the cold invade my bones. I get back in my rental car and leave the quiet of St. Peter's to return to the storm of Ferguson.

"The superlatives in China continue -- the latest symbol of China's ""bigger is much, much better"" ethos is open for business. Located in Chengdu (population 14 million), capital of Sichuan province in southwestern China, the New Century Global Center is the ""largest freestanding building in the world,"" Chinese officials say. Though the words ""world's largest"" usually bring to mind an image of a towering skyscraper, this project actually isn't all that tall. But it's certainly big. At 500 meters long, 400 meters wide and 100 meters high, the 1.7-million-square-meter mega-structure is capable of housing 20 Sydney Opera Houses and almost three times the size of the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. The Global Center, which opened June 28, is home to business offices, hotels, movie theaters, shopping malls, a faux Mediterranean village and family-themed attractions such as a water park called Paradise Island. The New Century Global Center is located in an entirely new planned area of Chengdu called Tainfu New District. Chengdu is also currently expanding its subway line and plans to construct a new airport by 2020, further suggesting official ambitions to make the city an economic and cultural capital of western China. From June 6-8, Chengdu hosted this year's Fortune Global Forum, an annual invite-only event featuring chairs, presidents, and CEOs of the world's largest companies.

"China's first lunar rover is expected to land on the moon on Saturday, less than two weeks after it blasted off from Earth, according to Chinese media reports. The landing will make China one of only three nations -- after the United States and the former Soviet Union -- to ""soft-land"" on the moon's surface, and the first to do so in more than three decades. Chang'e-3, the unmanned spacecraft carrying the rover, is due to touch down on a lava plain named Sinus Iridum, or Bay of Rainbows, shortly after 3 p.m. GMT  (10 a.m. ET) on December 14, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. On landing, Chang'e-3 will release Jade Rabbit (called Yutu in Chinese) -- a six-wheeled lunar rover equipped with at least four cameras and two mechanical legs that can dig up soil samples to a depth of 30 meters. The solar-powered rover will patrol the moon's surface, studying the structure of the lunar crust as well as soil and rocks, for at least three months. The robot's name was decided by a public online poll and comes from a Chinese myth about the pet white rabbit of a goddess, Chang'e, who is said to live on the moon. Chopsticks and soup spoons: Inspiration behind China's space tools . Weighing 140 kilograms, the slow-moving rover carries an optical telescope for astronomical observations and a powerful ultraviolet camera that will monitor how solar activity affects the various layers -- troposphere, stratosphere and ionosphere -- that make up the Earth's atmosphere, China's information technology ministry said in a statement. The Jade Rabbit is also equipped with radioisotope heater units, allowing it to function during the cold lunar nights when temperatures plunge as low as -180Â°C (-292Â°F). China has rapidly built up its space program since it first sent an astronaut into space in 2003. In 2012, the country conducted 18 space launches, according to the Pentagon. The Chang'e-3 mission constitutes the second phase of China's moon exploration program, which includes orbiting, landing and returning to Earth. In 2010, China captured images of the landing site for the 2013 probe, the Bay of Rainbows, which is considered to be one of the most picturesque parts of the moon. Within the next decade, China expects to open a permanent space station in the Earth's orbit. Timeline: China's race into space . But scientists in the United States have expressed concern that the Chang'e-3 mission could skew the results of a NASA study of the moon's dust environment. The spacecraft's descent is likely to create a noticeable plume on the moon's surface that could interfere with research already being carried out by NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), Jeff Plescia, chair of NASA's Lunar Exploration Analysis Group told news site, Space.com in November. The Chang'e-3 spacecraft blasted off from a Long March 3B rocket in China's Sichuan province on December 2, and reached the moon's orbit at 100 kilometers (about 60 miles) from its surface less than five days later. On Tuesday, it descended into an elliptical orbit with its lowest point just 15 kilometers off the lunar surface, a spokesperson for China's Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense told Xinhua. The Soviet Union's Luna 24 probe was the last space mission to land on the moon in August, 1976 -- four years after the United States launched the manned Apollo 17 mission.","A Chinese spacecraft, Chang'e-3, is due to land on the moon this weekend .

"(CNN)A Honduran beauty queen and her sister were found dead Wednesday, police said, and the sister's boyfriend and another man have been arrested in connection with the case. The bodies of MarÃ­a JosÃ© Alvarado MuÃ±oz, the reigning Miss World Honduras, and her sister, Sofia Trinidad Alvarado, were found  in a mountainous area beside a river after they had been missing for several days, Honduran police said in comments aired by CNN affiliate Televicentro. Plutarco Antonio Ruiz Rodriguez and Aris Valentin Maldonado Mejia are now in police custody, and investigators believe more people are involved in the sisters' deaths, Police Commissioner Rolando Casco Torres told Televicentro. Ruiz is Sofia's boyfriend, police say, according to CNN en EspaÃ±ol. The sisters disappeared last Thursday night after going to a spa for a birthday party for Ruiz in Santa Barbara, northwest of the capital of Tegucigalpa, police told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. Ruiz is suspected of killing the two sisters, said Leandro Osorio, chief of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation. Ruiz also ""is considered the person who was most in contact"" with the victims, Deputy Police Commissioner Rolando Casco added, according to Televicentro. Alvarado, 19, was supposed to leave for London soon to participate in the Miss World pageant, police said. Their family reported the women's disappearance on Saturday. Their mother, Teresa MuÃ±oz, initially believed her two daughters were kidnapped. Eduardo Zablah, director of the pageant in Honduras, told Televicentro that Alvarado and her sister were last seen getting into a vehicle after attending a party last week. The young woman was to be among the contestants from more than 120 countries who arrive in London this week for early rounds of the Miss World pageant. The final round is scheduled for December 14. A student from Santa BÃ¡rbara, Honduras, Alvarado beat 18 contestants to win the Miss World Honduras crown in April. In her profile on the pageant's website, she described herself as ""dedicated"" and said she would someday like to go into government, specifically as a diplomat for her country. She also said that she liked playing volleyball and soccer, eating Honduran food and performing the country's traditional punta dance. Julia Morley, the chairman of the Miss World pageant, said contestants will hold a special service Sunday to honor Alvarado and her sister and offer prayers for their families. ""We are devastated by this terrible loss of two young women, who were so full of life,"" Morley said. Honduras has the world's highest murder rate, the United Nations reported earlier this year, with 90.4 homicides per 100,000 people in 2012. Journalist Elvin Sandoval, reporting from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet in Atlanta contributed to this report.","More are believed to be involved in sisters' deaths, police tell CNN affiliate .

"China is launching its first lunar probe in early December, state-run Xinhua news agency reported Tuesday, just over a decade after the country first sent an astronaut into space. The Chang'e-3 probe -- which will blast off from a Long March 3B rocket in Sichuan province located in southwest China -- is expected to land on the moon's surface in mid-December, a spokesman for the China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence told Xinhua. The unmanned mission marks China's first attempt at a soft-landing on the lunar surface and the first soft-landing on the moon since the Soviet Luna 24 probe in 1976. China sets course for lunar landing this year . On landing, the spacecraft will release Jade Rabbit (called Yutu in Chinese) -- a six-wheeled lunar rover equipped with four cameras and two mechanical legs that can dig up soil samples, a designer for the rover told Xinhua earlier this month. A public poll determined the the solar-powered robot's name, which comes from the white pet rabbit of the Chinese moon godess Chang'e. The slow-moving rover will patrol the moon's surface for at least three months, according to Xinhua. Timeline: China's race into space . China is yet to announce the probe's preferred landing site, but researchers say an impact crater named Sinus Iridum, or Bay of Rainbows, is its likely destination. In 2010, China's previous lunar mission captured images of the crater while scouting potential landing sites for the 2013 probe. In the United States, scientists are concerned the Chinese mission could interfere with a NASA study of the moon's dust environment.

"Europe's bailout fund chief arrived in Beijing on Friday to hold discussions with potential investors looking for assistance to help ease its debt crisis that has threatened global economic stability. Klaus Regling, chief executive of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), said he expected to meet with officials of China's Ministry of Finance and the People's Bank of China. ""It's useful to come so soon after the end of the summit of the EU and to inform the officials in Beijing about the outcome of the summit,"" he told the press in Beijing. ""It does not mean I expect any precise outcome of our talks. There are no negotiations going on. These are regular consultations at early phase and there will be no conclusions during our visit."" He declined to say how much the Chinese have invested in EFSF. He also declined to answer questions on whether China has raised pre-conditions in exchange for extending financial help. He said he is not in China as an EU official. Regling's visit comes a day after European countries reached a deal to tackle the debt crisis with a proposal that would give Greece additional bailout support and other measures aimed to boost market confidence. Chinese President Hu Jintao and his French counterpart Nicolas Sarkozy talked on Thursday by phone about further economic cooperation, but did not discuss any plans for a bailout. China has expressed its support for Europe amid the crisis, but has only promised to help by resuming trade and investments in safe European bonds. In September, China's Commerce Ministry said it is concerned the crisis could lead to trade frictions. Commenting on the newly-reached deal Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said Thursday: ""We hope the bailout deal will be conducive to bolstering market confidence, promoting the sustainable economic development of the Eurozone and the process of European integration."" As the world's second-large economy, China has said Europe's failure to address its sovereign debt crisis could hurt China-EU trade relations. China has long pushed to be recognized as a market economy by the EU, but many European businesses still complain of unfair trade barriers such as restricted access to Chinese government tenders, investment limitations and intellectual property violations. China's economy has also experienced a slump as a result of economic turmoil in the West. In September, China's trade growth slowed as exports increased by their slowest pace in seven months and imports slowed from a month earlier. Still, Regling sees good reasons why China would be interested in EFSF bonds. ""China must invest every month because its current account has surplus, the foreign exchange reserve of China goes up every month,"" he said. ""They are interested in finding effective, solid and safe investment opportunities and I'm happy that the euro bond can be considered in that category. I am optimistic we will have a longer term relationship because we will continue to provide safe, effective investment opportunities.""","Klaus Regling is holding discussions with potential investors to help ease the European debt crisis .

"(CNN)Locked inside the gemstone there appears to be a human face. As the jewel is turned it fragments, appearing to be looking in several different directions at once. How the disembodied head, which seems to have a life of its own, was spirited into the gem seems to be something of a mystery. ""It is a sacred thing to create a face,"" says Wallace Chan, 58, the Chinese artisan jeweler that produced the piece. ""It's like a ghost appearing in the gem as you work. The dialogue of gemstone, color and light gives it life. ""There is a Buddhist saying that every person has many selves, and that inspired me spiritually as I created this work."" The work, Now and Always, is a depiction of Horae, the Greek goddess of the seasons. Her dancing was said to move the year from through winter to fall, spring and summer. Such a multifaceted figure from mythology seemed the perfect inspiration for the jeweler. Chan's exceptional artistry has caught the eye of a number of high-profile buyers, including Francois Curiel, chairman of Christie's in Asia, and Prince Henrik of Denmark. Carving out his own identity . It's not the first time that Chan has ""created"" a human face in a jewel. But Now and Always is certainly the finest demonstration of the ""Wallace cut"", a technique that Chan invented and perfected over decades. Rather than cutting into the surface of the jewel, shaping it into a geometric form, Chan cuts into it from the back, carving out complex images from inside the gem. ""Every stroke and cut has to consider movement of the light,"" he says. ""It took a lot of practice because I had to learn how to carve in reverse. ""When you work from the back of the jewel, right is left, top is bottom and deep becomes shallow. It is like having to drive a car backwards and forwards at the same time."" Chan uses a dentist's drill with a specially adapted blade, which rotates 36,000 times a minute. When he started using the tool, he quickly realized that the heat generated would damage the gemstone -- a major problem with material that is this expensive. So he developed a technique of working under cold water. ""It means I can't see clearly when I'm cutting,"" he says. ""It becomes a very repetitive process. I make one cut, take it out of the water to check it, dry the stone, check it again, and if it's fine I put it back in the water and make another cut."" This is a painstaking process, but for Chan it is also a meditative one. He puts his ""soul and consciousness into the creation"", he says, and becomes so absorbed that he ""forgets [his] own existence"". ""My mind is one with the work, and my physical self is removed from the gemstone,"" he explains. ""It's quite emotional, because I'm within in the inner world of gemstone, focused on how the light enters and interacts with the colors."" From rags to riches . Chan's technique is the culmination of many years of development. He was born in a poor part of Fuzhou in 1958, and left school at the age of 13. In order to support his family, he became an apprentice to a sculptor making Chinese religious iconography. He went on to study Western sculpture, and in 1974 set up his own workshop. After being commissioned by a Taiwanese art collector to make a jeweled ""stupa"", or Buddhist reliquary, Chan's focus shifted from sculpture to jewelery and he began to explore innovative techniques. He began setting jewels in titanium instead of gold, which allowed him to create ""jewelery sculptures"" that were still light enough to wear. He also experimented with using gems to fix each other in place, rather than metal settings, as well as new methods of cutting jade. But his dream was to find an entirely new way of working with gemstones. Gradually, he refined his ideas until he arrived at the concept of reverse cutting. In the Eighties he began to practice, using cheap crystals. But after a year-and-a-half, he realized that the tools he had been using were not equal to the task. So he visited  factories that produced medical instruments, and after six months of research, came up with the idea of modifying a dentist's drill. The rest is history. ""It was the only way to satisfy the standard I wanted to achieve,"" he says. The height of exclusivity . Chan was the first Asian artist to exhibit his work at the prestigious Bienalle des Antiquaires in Paris. In 2012, he showed ""Great Wall"", a necklace made of diamond maple leaves with a central jade stone. It sold for $73.5 million. This year, he showed ""Vividity"", a brooch featuring a deep pink, 64-carat Elbaite tourmaline surrounded by rubies and colored diamonds. These pieces of jewelry carry such an aura of exclusivity that it is rare to find a Chan piece on the open market. Most of his work is sold directly to collectors, who are loath to sell them on. When they are put up for sale, they carry hefty price tags. Two years ago, a small pair of Chan earrings sold in Hong Kong for $555,000. ""Each piece can take me thousands of hours,"" he says. ""It is like going on a journey each time."" The future Underground: London's new spaceship-style tube trains . Did artists eerily predict the Ukraine crisis? Would you eat Fukushima soup?

"(CNN)North Korea responded harshly to a United Nations draft resolution referring the reclusive regime to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, promising that such a move would prompt it to conduct more nuclear tests. A U.N. General Assembly committee Tuesday voted in favor of the draft resolution condemning the country's human rights record and calling for ""targeted sanctions."" Before the vote, Choe Myong Nam, North Korea's representative at the U.N., issued a familiar warning, saying that seeking to punish the country on human rights ""is compelling us not to refrain any further from conducting nuclear tests."" ""The reality is the need for us to maintain powerful state capability in order to defend our people's human rights,"" he said. ""The outrageous and unreasonable human rights campaign staged by the United States and it followers in their attempts to eliminate the state and social system of the (North Korea) is compelling us not to refrain any further from conducting nuclear tests."" The 111-19 vote, with 55 abstentions, is merely a recommendation. The General Assembly does not have the power to refer the regime or its leader, Kim Jong Un, to the ICC. The non-binding measure will come up for a vote by the General Assembly in December. The authority to refer a country to the ICC lies only with the U.N. Security Council, a 15-member body charged with maintaining global security. The five permanent members at the core of the Security Council, including China and Russia, wield veto powers. Opponents of the resolution -- including China, Russia and Cuba -- said the measure was politically manipulated and would set a precedent for other nations to be targeted in the future. The North Korean representative told the U.N. gathering Tuesday that the resolution ""provoked confrontation"" and ""failed to reflect the reality on the ground."" China is likely to use its veto against the resolution.  Chinese officials have repeatedly said efforts to send North Korea's leadership to the ICC ""won't help improve a country's human rights condition."" North Korea's longtime ally has never wavered in its support for Pyongyang. North Korea's leaders have been accused of employing murder, torture, slavery, sexual violence and mass starvation to prop up the isolated regime and exercise total control over its citizens. North Korea has repeatedly denied the existence of political camps or human rights abuses in the country, and has accused the United States and its allies of seeking to discredit and overthrow the North Korean leadership. North Korea: 'We were forced to eat grass and soil' In February, the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea published a 400-page report documenting widespread torture and abuse, and called for urgent action, including the referral of its findings to the ICC for possible prosecution. Last month, U.S. military officials said they believe the North Koreans have the capability to mount a nuclear warhead on an intermediate or long-range missile. If true, it represents a significant increase in North Korea's quest for a long-range nuclear weapon. Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, said he believes the North Koreans have the ""capability"" to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile, but stressed they have not tested any such device. In April, North Korea announced that it wouldn't rule out ""a new form of a nuclear test"" to strengthen its nuclear deterrent capabilities. Experts have speculated that that could refer to the testing of a uranium bomb. The regime in Pyongyang is known to have conducted three previous tests, all of them believed to be based on plutonium.

"China's new president sought to address concerns among African leaders about the uneven nature of trade relations on Monday, promising an equal relationship that would promote development on the continent. Xi Jinping made the speech defending China's economic role in Africa in Tanzania, the first stop of his African tour. He travels to South Africa on Tuesday and will attend a summit of the BRICS countries in the port city of Durban on Wednesday. The focus on Africa on his first trip overseas trip underscores the strategic importance of the continent's natural resources for the world's second biggest economy, but local leaders are asking whether the relationship has benefited Africa as much as it has China. Xi will finish his trip in the Republic of Congo, from where China imports oil to fuel its economic growth . In what was billed by Chinese media as a major foreign policy speech, Xi said that China had done its best to help Africa's development and insisted on equality among all countries, irrespective of size, strength and wealth. ""Africa belongs to the African people,"" he said. ""In developing relations with Africa, all countries should respect Africa's dignity and independence,"" he added. A lot is at stake. Africa is already a major source of natural resources for China and with African economies now some of the world's fastest growing, it's also an emerging a marketplace for Chinese-made goods. Trade between Africa and China totaled $200 billion in 2012, according to Chinese state media, and the country is Africa's largest trading partner. African leaders have welcomed China's no-strings investment as a counterbalance to Western aid that is usually conditional on reducing poverty, stamping out corruption or introducing democratic reforms. But some, including Botswana President Ian Khama and Nigerian central bank governor Lamido Sanusi, have begun to question to what extent Africa has benefited. ""Cracks are appearing in this China-Africa relationship,"" said CNN Beijing and former Africa correspondent David McKenzie. ""There's a sense from Africans that it's not an equal relationship. That China is extracting oil and then in return building infrastructure projects with its own companies and own workers and not necessarily transferring the skills to African workers."" Xi signed trade and cultural agreements in Tanzania on Sunday and is due to meet with South African counterpart Jacob Zuma on Tuesday. He will then fly to Durban to attend the BRICS summit -- which groups Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- where plans to create a multinational lender to rival the World Bank will be discussed. Gratitude for Chinese investment in Africa has also been tarnished by a number of scandals, including the distribution of fake and poor quality anti-malarial drugs made illicitly in China and the mistreatment of workers. ""It is time for Africans to wake up to the realities of their romance with China,"" Sanusi wrote in an editorial in the Financial Times this month. ""China takes out primary goods and sells us manufactured ones. This was also the essence of colonialism."" Botswana's president recently told a South African newspaper that Chinese companies had let down his country, particularly over a power generation project. Khama added that other African leaders shared his concerns. But Adams Bodomo, African Studies director at Hong Kong University, says claims of neo-colonialism are overblown and that China's influence ""was more positive than negative."" According to Xinhua, 85% of the staff employed by the more 2,000 Chinese companies operating in Africa were Africans. ""In 10 years, China has built a lot more infrastructure than, for example, Britain did in my own country -- Ghana -- for 100 years,"" Bodomo said.","China's new president seeks to address unease over trade .

"Africa must shake off its romantic view of China and accept Beijing is a competitor as much as a partner and capable of the same exploitative practices as the old colonial powers, Nigeria's central bank governor has warned. Reflecting the shifting views of a growing number of senior African officials who fear the continent's anaemic industrial sector is being battered by cheap Chinese imports, Lamido Sanusi cautions that Africa is ""opening itself up to a new form of imperialism"". ""China takes from us primary goods and sells us manufactured ones. This was also the essence of colonialism,"" he writes in the Financial Times. His remarks are among the most trenchant yet by a serving African official about the continent's ties with the world's second largest economy. Trade between China and Africa was worth more than $200bn in 2012, 20 times what it was in 2000 when Beijing committed to a policy of accelerated engagement. It has been a period of strong growth partly thanks to Asian demand for African resources . But a boom in commodities, services and consumer spending has coincided with the relative decline of African manufacturing from 12.8 per cent to 10.5 per cent of regional GDP, according to UN figures. African leaders and the African Development Bank have recently urged governments to work with each other to ensure they maximise benefits from relations with their leading trade partner, but they have traditionally cloaked their concerns in emollient diplomatic language. In contrast Mr Sanusi has thrown down the gauntlet to Beijing. ""China is no longer a 'fellow underdeveloped economy',"" he writes. ""China is the second biggest economy in the world, an economic giant capable of the same forms of exploitation as the west. China is a major contributor to the de-industrialisation of Africa and thus African underdevelopment."" An experienced private sector banker, Mr Sanusi is credited with cleaning up Nigeria's banking system after a crash that wiped out 60 per cent of bank capital in 2009. He has also given Nigeria's central bank a more activist role, providing concessional refinancing to banks exposed to manufacturers and small and medium enterprises struggling to service high-interest, short-term loans. In his article, Mr Sanusi argues that African countries must respond to ""predatory"" trade practices -- such as subsidies and currency manipulation -- that give Chinese exports an advantage. He also says the continent must build infrastructure and invest in education so that African businesses can compete for continental trade as Chinese labour costs rise. ""China is losing that advantage as its economy grows and prosperity spreads,"" he writes. ""Africa must seize the moment and move manufacturing of goods consumed in Africa out of China to the African continent ... I cannot recommend a divorce. However, a review of the exploitative elements in this marital contract is long overdue."" His comments come ahead of South Africa's hosting of a summit of Bric nations later this month. South Africa, the largest economy in sub-Saharan Africa, was incorporated into the bloc of Brazil, Russia, India and China last year. South African President Jacob Zuma last week warned western companies to shed an old ""colonial"" mindset when investing in Africa and to stop warning against the embrace of China. ""China is doing business in a particular way and we think we can see the benefits,"" he told the Financial Times. ""But we are very, very careful,"" he added, citing Africa's experience of colonialism. Such a relationship he said must ""benefit both. And this is what we and China have been agreeing.""","Nigeria's central bank governor warns China is a rival as much as trade partner .

"Washington (CNN)Republicans are sensing that a world seemingly spinning out of control could give them an opening to reclaim their traditional strength on national security issues heading into the 2016 presidential election. Even before terrorists killed 12 people at a Paris magazine this week, Republicans were fine-tuning an assault on President Barack Obama's foreign policy as timid and naive, and stumbling everywhere from the deserts of Syria to the Kremlin in Moscow. But one of the brothers who carried out the Paris strike spent several months in Yemen in 2011, according to U.S. officials, receiving weapons training and working with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. That could undermine Obama's proud claim of dismantling al Qaeda's ""core"" and put Democrats on the defensive -- especially Hillary Clinton, who carried out the President's foreign policy as his first-term Secretary of State. ""There are big opportunities for Republicans to reclaim their traditional voter advantage on national security,"" said Kori Schake, a former National Security Council, and State Department official in the George W. Bush White House. ""To most Americans, the world feels like a dangerous place right now. Six years into (the) Obama administration, it is difficult for President Obama to blame that on anybody but himself."" Until 2008, Republicans enjoyed a perception among voters for several decades that they -- and not Democrats -- were best suited to lead America's national security policy. But Obama reversed that conceit by arguing that former President George W. Bush squandered global goodwill after the September 11 attacks with a unilateralist foreign policy, the invasion of Iraq and ""tough talk"" that alienated US allies. ""We are the party of Roosevelt. We are the party of Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe,"" Obama told Americans as he accepted his party's 2008 nomination. Four years later, Obama turned a similar trick, brandishing his leadership in hunting down al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and ending the war in Iraq. The President painted Republican Mitt Romney as a vacillating hawk who wanted to return to endless war and taunted his opponent over his anti-Russia rhetoric by suggesting ""the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back."" Foreign policy as an issue is rarely decisive in presidential elections -- at least once a candidate has managed to convince voters he or she is up to being commander-in-chief. But a chaotic global environment which defies U.S. efforts to exert control -- even if it is not all the fault of the sitting president -- is rarely good news for the party in control of the White House and key players in the Republican national security establishment believe that foreign policy could feature especially prominently in the coming election. Potential candidates like Sen. Marco Rubio and Rand Paul have been quick to spot the political potential of such an environment heading into the 2016 race -- and are already waging their own internal duel over the party's national security message. Broadly, the establishment Republican critique of Obama is that far from his promise to reestablish American leadership, he has instead presided over an era of disengagement from the world. Republicans complain Obama is happier chatting to foreign dictators of longtime U.S. enemies such as Iran and Cuba than traditional American allies like Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states or even European powers. And they claim that Obama's deliberate -- critics would say hesitant -- brand of global leadership on issues like Syria has deepened the global crisis and abdicated U.S. leadership. Of all the potential Republican candidates, Rubio has developed the most sweeping case against Obama's foreign policy, as he has sought to frame himself as a statesman-in-waiting after four years in the Senate. He warned in a Daily Caller op-ed in November that Obama ""peeps timidly from behind an ever-thinning curtain of American strength, watching idly as new and resurgent forces challenge global order. ""Even as an increasingly hostile Russia threatens a new cold war, President Obama uses baby-steps and half-measures in defense of our allies, our principles, and our people, when he acts at all,"" Rubio said, using the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall to paint himself as the heir to Ronald Reagan's foreign policy legacy. Rubio's fellow Floridian Jeb Bush has yet to lay out his foreign policy since moves to explore a possible presidential campaign, other than to slam Obama's plan to reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba. But he signaled in a Wall Street Journal forum late last year that he would associate himself with the traditional Republican orthodoxy on foreign policy. In general terms, that means more defense spending and robust US rhetoric backed up by action -- an approach likely shared by other possible Republican candidates including Texas Gov. Rick Perry and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Bush also believes that America's role in the world will become an increasingly potent campaign issue. ""Six months ago, I would have said it might be a continuing of the focus on domestic issues because they are big and they are challenging,"" he said at the forum. ""But there is a growing awareness that we can't withdraw from the world. There is an unraveling taking place."" He added: ""I do think that foreign policy and maybe a reevaluation of what the role is of the United States in the world will become is important."" Before they go after Obama however, Republicans have to get their own story straight on foreign policy as a debate plays out by traditional national security hawks and a more nuanced stance embodied by Paul. The Kentucky Senator, who comes from the libertarian tradition, has been keen to dispel perceptions that he is an isolationist as he considers how to build a coalition that could lead to the Republican nomination. But he still stands for a restrained use of US military force overseas. He explains that he backed the use of force against al Qaeda after the Sept.11, 2001, attacks, but opposes a continued long-term U.S. engagement in Afghanistan. ""Yes, we need a hammer ready, but not every civil war is a nail,"" he said in a major foreign policy speech in October. ""We need a foreign policy that recognized our limits, preserves our might and a common sense conservative realism of strength and action."" There is an irony to the coming Republican assault on Obama's foreign policy, because it mimics the strategy the president himself used to pave the way to the White House. But it isn't a given that Republicans hopes of exploiting a national security meltdown abroad will pan out because the opening exchanges of a presidential campaign are often a poor guide to the themes and issues that will decide it. If, for instance, the current economic bounce back fizzles, the plight of the middle class could outweigh all other issues. ""It's a heck of a long time, there is plenty of time for domestic issues to return and be number one,"" said Peter Feaver, a former National Security Council official for George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, now with Duke University. ""But on the other hand it does seem likely that foreign policy will seem even more salient in 2016 than it was in 2012."" And Obama can still claim to have crushed the leadership of al Qaeda in tribal regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan, and waged a largely covert drone war against extremists elsewhere. He sees his presidency as a historic mission to move America on from the post-Sept. 11 period of constant war and to chart a sustainable strategy to fight extremism. Any GOP candidate using foreign policy as a cudgel to attack against what will likely become known as the ""Obama-Clinton"" foreign policy, must deal with one large elephant in the room -- George W. Bush. There is little public appetite for the era of intervention that characterized Bush's presidency and Republicans face the task of winning back public trust. But Schake said any Republican running on a foreign policy platform would be able to acknowledge the faults of the last Republican presidency, while refocusing on the presidency of Obama. There are ""legitimate criticisms of Bush administration foreign policy, but (they) are hard to sustain after eight years of a Democratic presidency,"" she said.","Republicans believe world turmoil undermines Obama .
But GOP yet to resolve its own argument on national security .

"A former prosecutor who declined to bring charges against Bill Cosby a decade ago said Wednesday that he wishes he could've nailed the comedian on an allegation that he drugged and molested a woman at his Pennsylvania home. Bruce Castor also told CNN that he believed Cosby -- a beloved figure who, with his wit and boyish smile, has charmed audiences as a family-friendly stand-up comic, the voice of Fat Albert, the host of ""Picture Pages"" and the star of a wildly popular eponymous sitcom -- lied to authorities. In January 2004, Andrea Constand, then a 31-year-old staffer for the women's basketball team at Temple University, Cosby's alma mater, was at the comedian's Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, home when Cosby provided her medication that made her dizzy, she alleged the following year. She later woke up to find her bra undone and her clothes in disarray, she further alleged to police in her home province of Ontario in January 2005. Cosby's attorney in the case, Walter M. Phillips Jr., called the allegations ""utterly preposterous"" and ""plainly bizarre"" at the time, yet in a civil filing, Constand's lawyers said they had found 13 ""Jane Does"" with similar stories. Cosby settled the civil suit in 2006. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but when journalist and publicist Joan Tarshis came forward with another similar story this weekend, Cosby attorney John Schmitt denied her claim and others', labeling them ""decade-old, discredited allegations."" Schmitt later amended that statement to say he wasn't referring to Constand, who resolved her differences ""to the mutual satisfaction of Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand years ago."" 'I couldn't check her blood' Castor, who was the district attorney for Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, when Constand came forward in 2005, now tells CNN he thought Constand was credible, and he thought Cosby was evasive in his interview with prosecutors. Castor, whose assistants interviewed Cosby, said he felt the comedian was setting up a defense that Constand was at his house on her own volition and that anything occurring between them was consensual. ""Back then, the desire on our part to move forward was pretty strong,"" he said. ""The problem with the case was she waited a year until she told police about it."" This left Castor no way to corroborate Constand's allegations, he said. He couldn't check her blood, urine, hair or fingernails for traces of drugs, he couldn't obtain hair or fiber for analysis, and he couldn't obtain a warrant to search Cosby's home for evidence. ""I had a theory that Cosby had drugged the woman using something to make her sleepy and to make her defenseless or unable to recall what happened, but because of the delay, I couldn't check her blood,"" he said. Of Cosby's interview with prosecutors, Castor said, ""I thought he was lying. I thought he was evasive, and I thought that those things would be of value if I had another piece (of evidence) to go forward with."" The case would have come down to she said, he said, and while Castor felt strongly that Constand was telling the truth, her statements alone were not going to be enough to convict Cosby, the ex-prosecutor said. ""Did I think he probably did something inappropriate? Yes. Did I think that I could prove it beyond a reasonable doubt based on available, credible and admissible evidence? No, I didn't,"" he said. Castor released a statement on his office's website in 2005, saying that he found that ""insufficient credible and admissible evidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could be sustained beyond a reasonable doubt."" Constand's attorney filed the civil suit two weeks later. Latest in line of accusations . Castor's account comes a day after former supermodel Janice Dickinson became the latest of a handful of women to accuse the 77-year-old comic of sexual assault publicly. She told ""Entertainment Tonight"" that Cosby raped her in 1982 after giving her a pill and a glass of red wine during a dinner in Lake Tahoe. ""The last thing I remember was Bill Cosby in a patchwork robe, dropping his robe and getting on top of me. And I remember a lot of pain,"" she said. Dickinson did not return a telephone call from CNN seeking comment, but Cosby has repeatedly said previous allegations are untrue. He has never been prosecuted. His attorney, Martin Singer, addressed Dickinson's allegations specifically in a statement, calling them a ""fabricated lie"" and saying they contradicted what she wrote in her autobiography and what she said during a 2002 New York Observer interview. Since 2005, several women have come forward with remarkably similar stories about being drugged and sexually assaulted by the comedian. This year, the accusations resurfaced, and earlier this month, a seemingly harmless post on Cosby's Twitter account turned them into a social media storm. After the accusations gained steam again, one of his accusers, Barbara Bowman, turned to the public once more with an article in The Washington Post and interviews with CNN. Bowman alleged she was drugged, then raped, though she said she never saw drugs. ""I woke up out of a very confused state not in my clothes,"" she said. On Saturday, NPR broadcast an awkward interview with Cosby in which he didn't utter a word when repeatedly asked about the accusations. NPR host Scott Simon filled the airtime by saying Cosby was just ""shaking his head no.""","""I had a theory that Cosby had drugged the woman,"" ex-prosecutor tells CNN .

"China has emerged as one of the fastest-growing sources of international buyers for US real estate -- in what some see as a sign that China's rich are increasingly seeking to take their money out of the country. According to a report published by the National Association of Realtors this week, buyers from China and Hong Kong made up the second-largest group of foreign buyers of homes in the US in the 12 months to March -- Canadians took first place -- accounting for $9bn of sales. That is a 23 per cent increase on the $7.3bn of sales they notched up in the previous 12 months and an 88 per cent increase from $4.8bn of sales in 2010. ""International Chinese buyers are seen as a very desirable market by real estate agents at the moment,"" said Jed Smith, managing director at the NAR. ""The strongest growth is coming from China and the rise of Chinese buyers has made up for declines in sales from buyers from the UK and Mexico."" Sales to international Chinese buyers still represent only a tiny fraction of the overall US market, which recorded $928.2bn in sales in the year to March. But at the top end of the market, it's a different story. The 23 per cent jump in sales value, despite flat sales volume, suggests that Chinese buyers have been active at the top end. Pamela Liebman, chief executive of The Corcoran Group, a residential real estate brokerage company, says there has been a ""huge"" influx of wealthy mainland Chinese shopping for high-end properties in New York since the start of the year. ""It's extraordinary,"" she says. ""Five years ago, we never talked about Chinese buyers. We started noticing them 18 months ago but they have only become much more prevalent in the past year."" Ms Liebman says she saw ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars in sales last year to Chinese buyers and the pace has intensified since the start of 2012. ""The past quarter has been our best quarter ever in terms of sales to Chinese buyers."" Properties that have been snapped up by China's rich range from $1m apartments to $20m trophy properties. ""Buying groups"" -- group tours of mainland buyers coming to New York to view properties -- have become commonplace, says Ms Liebman. ""It's a market that we are now targeting heavily,"" she says. ""We have been recruiting Mandarin-speaking agents and have launched affiliations with brokers in China."" Reasons for purchases vary, say those who have dealt with overseas Chinese buyers. Some are buying because they want to emigrate or they have children who will go to school in the US. Others buy because the numbers add up: despite its recent dip, the renminbi is still up more than 4 per cent against the US dollar since the start of 2010 while US house prices are still in recovery mode and appear cheap compared with Australia or Canada. ""When you look at how cheap US real estate is now compared with China, it makes a lot of sense to buy there, especially since you have more rights when you own a property in America,"" said a wealthy Chinese investor who has bought several properties in the US but asked not to be named so as not to draw attention to the fact of shifting assets abroad. Still others are simply looking for somewhere safe to park their cash. In a year that has seen China affected by political infighting at the top and mounting evidence that the economy faces a bigger-than-expected slowdown, there has been a sharp rise in Chinese millionaires seeking to settle in the US or at least to secure residency rights. EB-5, a little-known programme that gives a green card to any foreigner who invests at least $500,000 in a business forming 10 or more jobs in the US, received a record 1,675 Chinese applications during the first quarter. That compares with 2,408 applications in the whole of last year, 772 in 2010 and 63 in 2006. ""There is no doubt that the political situation back home is having an impact on how China's rich are thinking of preserving their wealth,"" says Ms Liebman. In China, all land is owned by the state and investors can only buy leasing rights of usually up to 70 years, rather than to secure outright ownership.","China has emerged as one of the fastest-growing sources of international buyers for US real estate .

"The Chinese government had stern words for Israel at the start of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's five-day visit to the country. ""We oppose the use of weapons. We believe the sovereignty of any country should be respected,"" said Hua Chunying, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman on Monday, responding to reports that Israel carried out airstrikes against its neighbor Syria last weekend. ""China calls upon relevant parties to bear in mind peace and stability of the region, to exercise restraint and refrain from any actions that may escalate the tension,"" she added. Strangely, Netanyahu's visit to China on Monday coincided with the arrival of the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. Beijing said it would be willing to host a bilateral meeting between the two Middle Eastern leaders. But an Israeli government official told CNN there were no plans for secret talks in China between Netanyahu and Abbas. ""Don't hold your breath for a summit in Beijing,"" the Israeli official told CNN, on condition of anonymity. The Israeli official said the Chinese had ""never been involved in mediating or suggesting new ideas or making plans. They are the big silent giant."" China has not traditionally played a mediation role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But this week the world's second largest economy appeared to be flexing its diplomatic muscles in the Middle East, proposing a four-point peace plan and repeating its call for the establishment of a Palestinian state with a capital in East Jerusalem. ""The issue, already lasting more than half a century, has brought deep suffering to the Palestinian people and remains an important reason of extended turbulence in the Middle East region,"" said Chinese president Xi Jinping, during a meeting with Abbas on Monday, according to China's state news agency Xinhua. Israel's prime minister is visiting China's commercial capital Shanghai on Tuesday. He is expected to travel on to Beijing on Wednesday. China's foreign ministry spokesman suggested Netanyahu may get a tough, unwelcome message from his Chinese hosts. ""On the current Syrian situation and Israel's continuous air raid inside, I have already expounded China's position,"" Hua said on Tuesday.  ""And we will explicitly tell the Israeli side China's position."" China has a long history of expressing public support for the Palestinians. The Chinese government has also used its veto in the United Nations Security Council to protect the Syrian government from facing Western-backed sanctions, throughout two years of bloody violence in Syria. However, Beijing has also quietly established closer trade ties in recent years with Israel.","Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu is in China for a five-day visit .

"The United States and China have the most important bilateral relationship in the world.  Whether they can develop a constructive, cooperative relationship or whether they become each others' greatest nightmare has enormous consequences for each country and for the capacity of the international system to manage regional and global issues. Both leaderships recognize what is at stake, which explains why, despite many disagreements, Washington and Beijing constantly stress the importance of building ties.  The two governments conduct more than 60 formal dialogues a year and engage each other daily, to a far greater extent than most people realize. Despite these efforts, each country has an underlying and growing distrust of the other's long-term intentions. Such distrust is corrosive, casting even well-intentioned actions and initiatives in a negative light. When President Nixon opened the door to Beijing 40 years ago, nobody imagined that U.S.-China relations would develop to this point.  But extensive governmental contacts between the nations, economic interdependence and huge flows of students and tourists back and forth have failed to stem the growth of underlying mutual distrust.  That distrust could well create a self-fulfilling prophecy of eventual confrontation. A key problem is that neither government is confident that it understands how the other sees the future of their relationship. Although each side senses distrust in the other, the real reasons for that attitude are unclear.  So, how do they separate propaganda efforts designed to manipulate from sincere concerns? Because this is such a tough and consequential problem, I teamed up with one of China's leading America specialists to write a report that lays out the underlying worries that each side has about the other and, especially, why they have these deep concerns.  Our report was published simultaneously last week in English and Chinese. My colleague wrote, in unvarnished fashion, about the analysis that leads many policymakers in China to believe the ultimate goal of the United States is to constrain or disrupt China's rise and to undermine its political system.  I wrote about U.S. hopes for a normal major power relationship with China over the long run and the reasons why many American policymakers are increasingly concerned that this may prove impossible. The reasons are complicated. In part, they include the inevitable tensions that arise when a global balance of power is changing.  My colleague and I expect that America will retain its leading role for many years to come, but the gap between U.S. and Chinese power and position is narrowing. Because of that, many in China fear the United States might resort to anti-Chinese measures  to maintain its lead.  American officials worry not so much that China will rise, but that Beijing will believe it can only do so at direct cost to the United States. Our enormously different political systems exacerbate this distrust.  Neither side understands very well the political and institutional constraints in the other's system, and both are inclined to assume the other is more strategic, centralized and internally disciplined than it is.  Neither is certain that it knows when the other is being honest about its domestic political constraints, and both tend to take random events as reflections of strategic intent. Beijing views America's pro-democracy foreign policy as aimed, in part, at changing China's system, while Washington inherently distrusts the motives and actions of authoritarian governments. And unsurprisingly, both sides have partially institutionalized distrust in their militaries, intelligence agencies, and offices focused on cybersecurity. Distrust about long-term intentions is thus grounded in complicated narratives in both countries.  Neither side wants an adversarial relationship, but both worry that it may become unavoidable.  And extensive efforts to build mutual trust to date are not working. New measures are necessary. Both governments must discuss, in depth, topics they have been avoiding.  What overall military postures in Asia will both permit China to meet its vital security needs and enable America to defend its allies and interests?  What kinds of mutual restraint can help bring about this outcome? How does each side view potential developments on the Korean Peninsula over the coming decade, and how would both plan to react to each scenario? America conducts surveillance activities just outside China's territorial waters that Beijing views as hostile and degrading. Could China provide some type of increased military transparency that could change this?  Could the military component of the Taiwan issue be reduced? Understanding views of the long term, clarifying thinking on key military issues and devising concrete efforts to build mutual confidence are the initiatives that could alter the perceptions in Washington and Beijing that enhance distrust.  The future can be shaped by intelligent actions, but those must be based on clear recognition of the reasons why  each side fears the future intentions of the other.","Kenneth Lieberthal: U.S. and China have the most important bilateral relationship in the world .

"China's state-run People's Daily newspaper is known for political correctness rather than a sense of humor. So when a report surfaced this week that North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un had been named the 2012 ""Sexiest Man Alive"", the self-described mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party cheered its Korean comrade on its website -- only this ""news"" came from satirical U.S. website, The Onion. China is North Korea's major ally and aid provider. Reporting something flattering on Kim must have been considered politically correct. Its website editors even built a gallery of photos to accompany the report, with slides featuring Kim riding a horse, inspecting troops and being hugged by female soldiers. While the item spiced up the usually staid pages of the website, it led to wave of sniggering as international media lampooned Chinese state media for being fooled by a bogus report from a well-known purveyor of offbeat humor and satire. Was the omniscient People's Daily really this gullible or was it the work of a mischievous insider with a penchant for satire? On Wednesday, a woman who took our call at the website's office in Beijing insisted that it was ""impossible that the People's Daily would quote from any unreliable media -- we do verify our news and sources."" The woman, who declined to identify herself, said the story and pictures had been removed a day after being posted. But the damage had been done and The Onion was relishing the publicity. ""Please visit our friends at the People's Daily in China, a proud Communist subsidiary of The Onion,"" read its statement. ""Exemplary reportage, comrades."" Chinese micro-bloggers couldn't resist getting in on the act too. ""The world was fooled by the People's Daily, because no Chinese believes this paper,"" wrote @Hai_Dao_Wu_Bian. So the Chinese have a sense of humor? Christopher Rea, who is writing a book on the cultural history of humor in modern China, says the Chinese have ""a robust sense of the farcical and the absurd, as well as a keen appreciation of watching those in power screw up."" Rea, a scholar at the Australian Center on China in the World, says ""the Chinese sense of humor runs the same gamut as elsewhere."" Linda Jaivin, a veteran China-watcher and co-author of ""New Ghosts Old Dreams,"" a book on Chinese literature and culture, said Beijing people's sense of humor tends to be ""very topical, political and satirical."" When a giant statue of Confucius suddenly appeared in Tiananmen Square, not far from Mao's iconic portrait early last year, tongues wagged about what it all signified politically -- was Confucius back to dislodge Mao as China's spiritual leader? The statue was moved off the square just as abruptly a few weeks later, prompting some in political circles to joke that the venerated sage, who hailed from rural Shandong, had been busted for not having a Beijing residence permit. For centuries political satire has been a staple for much of Chinese humor, and remains so during the Communist era. In the 1980s, when the first signs of official corruption related to economic reform began appearing, humorists cleverly minted ditties like these: . ""I'm a big official, so I eat and drink, eat and drink..."" ""It's not my money we're spending after all, so eat and be merry and let's have a ball!"" Nowadays, Chinese writers, artists, cartoonists, comedians and netizens resort to humor and satire to mock, question, challenge and document social phenomena, events and incidents. ""A lot of Chinese humor is pun-based and probably always has been,"" said Jaivin, who speaks Chinese fluently. ""The Chinese language is exceptionally rich in homonyms and is ripe for punning."" Much of it can be lost in translation but some does overcome any linguistic limits. When some Beijing residents nicknamed the new Koolhaus-designed office complex of CCTV, China's flagship television network, ""da kucha"" (the Big Underpants), for its resemblance to underwear, the government tried to give it a nicer sounding moniker. ""So they tried 'zhichuang' -- Window on Knowledge,"" recalled Jaivin. ""Catchy but worse, because as Beijing funsters worked out in about a microsecond, it's also a homonym for hemorrhoid."" The Chinese sense of humor has also become more global, Rea said, citing the ""E'gao phenomenon"" of spoofing and parody on the Internet that started in 2005 and is still popular, especially among tech-savvy youths. ""It draws strongly on international influences, down to the images, sounds, and texts used in video mash-ups,"" he said. So if Chinese humor is so robust, why did the editors at the People's Daily get duped? ""Maybe because many Chinese editors and journalists lack good knowledge of journalism and English so they find it hard to spot satire,"" suggested a graduate student in journalism in Beijing. ""Maybe because there is so much fake news and they lack the ability to distinguish real news from the fake."" Rea blamed the ""pervasive plagiarism of foreign news outlets in the Chinese official news media, combined with shoddy quality control or fact checking."" Is there a serious lesson to be learned here? ""The primary lesson that all journalists -- not just Chinese -- should draw from this is that all information needs to be verified before it is published,"" said Richard Hornik, a lecturer in journalism at Stony Brook University, who once covered China for Time Magazine. ""Since new media such as Weibo, Facebook and Twitter have made all of us publishers in the digital era,  all responsible citizens should verify information before they publish, forward, 'like' or retweet it."" How embarrassed should the People's Daily be? ""Extremely,"" quipped Jaivin. ""That said, I do hope no one gets sent to a labor camp over it.""","Chinese news site lampooned after taking an Onion satire for a real story .

"Chinese police have sent the criminal case involving the nephew of prominent blind human rights advocate Chen Guangcheng to the prosecution, signaling a possible trial soon, as well as continued official retribution against the activist's relatives, Chen and his family said. Chen Kegui, the nephew, was arrested in the city of Linyi in early May and accused of attempted murder shortly after his uncle escaped more than 18 months of heavily guarded house arrest. The family has maintained that the younger Chen injured a few officials with a kitchen knife in self-defense, when they broke into his house in the middle of the night and attacked his family after his activist-uncle ran away. ""The local authorities are now declaring war on justice and the conscience of the international community,"" Chen Guangcheng told CNN over the phone from the United States, where he is studying law at New York University. ""They're trying to separate his case from mine, but that's impossible."" Chen Guangfu, the activist's older brother and the nephew's father, hasn't been allowed to see his incarcerated son since his arrest. He said he learned from a government-appointed lawyer that police downgraded Kegui's alleged crime from attempted murder to ""intentional infliction of injury"" when sending the case to the prosecution. ""There has never been any fairness in this case -- they ignored the facts and refused to let us appoint lawyers for Kegui in accordance with law,"" the father said. ""The whole thing is their revenge against Guangcheng's escape, so I don't have any hope for a fair trial."" An official with Linyi's police department, who declined to give his name, told CNN that Chen Kegui's case is now ""in the judicial process"" and would not comment further. Repeated phone calls to the local prosecutor's office went unanswered Monday. Chen Guangcheng's arrival in the United States on May 19 -- along with his wife and children -- brought an end to a diplomatic firestorm between Beijing and Washington that erupted after he fled from house arrest in Linyi in late April and hid inside the U.S. embassy in Beijing for a week. In a video posted online after his escape, Chen addressed Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, detailing grotesque abuses -- including repeated beatings -- he said he and his family had suffered at the hands of local authorities during captivity. ""A fair trial for Chen Kegui would be hugely embarrassing to the Linyi authorities because family-appointed lawyers would want to bring in the years of unlawful persecution of Chen Guangcheng as relevant context and background,"" said Nicholas Bequelin, a Hong Kong-based senior Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch. ""That's what the authorities want to avoid at all cost."" Before and after leaving China, Chen Guangcheng has repeatedly said that officials from the central government have pledged a thorough investigation into his allegations against local authorities. He has also frequently expressed concern over the safety of his family members left behind. ""I think this is the test,"" Bequelin said of Chen Kegui's case. ""As long as he is being detained in this manner without regard to law, it would be very difficult to be optimistic about the government keeping its promise to Chen Guangcheng."" In 2006 the self-taught legal activist was sentenced to four years and three months in prison for ""damaging property and organizing a mob to disturb traffic."" His supporters have maintained that the charges were trumped up by local officials to punish his advocacy for victims of what he called abusive practices of the country's strict family planning policy, including forced abortions and sterilizations. Now Chen Guangcheng says Linyi authorities are handling his nephew's case almost exactly the same way as they did six years ago before his own trial. ""Kegui is becoming the second me based on the treatment he's received in the past few months,"" he said.","Chinese police sends case involving Chen Guangcheng's nephew to prosecution .

"(CNN)Ahead of me, a trail of lights snakes up toward the sky, moving relentlessly, step-by-step, in the darkness. I've tackled quite a few mountains in my life, but never have I hiked with as many solemn spirits as on Adam's Peak in Sri Lanka. Barefoot pilgrims are all around me. There are women, whose bangles can be heard rattling against tired ankles, and monks, pulling their maroon robes over their left shoulders to shield from the mountain chill. We're all going up silently toward the summit of what is a holy mountain for Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and Christians in Sri Lanka. The 2,243-meter (7,359 feet) Adam's Peak lies among the island nation's southern Central Highlands, 150 kilometers (93 miles) east of the capital Colombo. It's one of Sri Lanka's highest mountains, rising like a green fang from a carpet of dense forest reserve where wild elephants and leopards still dwell. It isn't the scenery or wildlife that daily pulls in thousands of pilgrims though. All of them are here to see a 1.8-meter-long rock formation that juts out from the summit. Tough going . To Buddhists, Sri Pada, or the sacred footprint, is an imprint left by the Buddha himself. Hindus say it belonged to Shiva while Christians and Muslims consider it a sign of Adam's passage. Local legend has it that Sri Lanka's King Valagambahu was the first to stumble upon Sri Pada during a reign that ended in about 76 BC. The peak gets another historic name check from none other than Marco Polo, who visited in the 14th century, reporting that his ascent was tough going. Today, a stone staircase helps almost every Sri Lankan tackle the peak several times during their lives. From December to May, the mountain glows nightly as torchlit pilgrims follow the trail to the top. Some climb in the afternoon to reach the shrine at sundown but the most popular and spiritual time to ascend is the middle of the night, summiting just in time to catch the first rays of dawn. Just getting to Adam's Peak is an act of devotion. Pure pilgrimage . After traveling from the central city town of Kandy to Hatton on a slow train through the relentless greenery of the area's Ceylonese tea estates, I catch a rickety bus to continue my journey. My destination is Dalhousie, a cluster of chai stalls, home stays and informal restaurants that marks the starting point of the five-kilometer Nallathanni climbing route, the shortest way to the summit. The basic facilities on offer are attuned to the reasons for the climb. This isn't a leisure pursuit, but a pure pilgrimage. My ascent begins at a chilly 3 a.m. The climb can take between two and a half and four hours -- I'm aiming to summit at the break of dawn at 6.30 a.m. Groups of pilgrims dressed in white lead me through the dark and to the beginning of the incline. ""Each time feels like the first,"" says Saman, a slender man from a village near Bentota on Sri Lanka's southern coast. He and his wife are tackling their fifth climb, accompanying their six-year-old son for his first ascent. Before the path starts rising, a monk from the nearby Japanese temple comes forward and in exchange for an offering, ties a white string around my waist as a form of blessing. And so, with the eyes of one of Sri Pada's benevolent gods hopefully on me, I proceed upward as the incline slowly turns into a stone staircase. Spiritual awakening? Along the way, vendors cook pans of soothing chai over portable gas stoves. Prices, like the sacred mountain, are steep. The peak comes into view a couple hours into the climb. Many hikers greet it with determined expressions, their only goal to arrive at Sri Pada before sunrise. As we get nearer, the darkness disperses in tones of blue. Just before dawn throws shards of burning red across the sky, we sail into a sea of pilgrims surrounding the shrine's platform. It's quite a sight. Pilgrims walk in circles reciting mantras, queuing up to pray before the sacred footprint. On the edge of the slope, young monks in wool hats hold their robes tight under their chins with chilled fingers, waiting for the sun's rays to bring the new day. With the sound of tolling bells at my back, I join the line and watch first light over central Sri Lanka. The spectacle is enough to stop my legs from aching and make me forget that I must, at some point, return to Earth. Getting there . Two daily trains leave from Kandy to Hatton. Number 1005 departs at 8:47 a.m. and arrives at 11:12 a.m. while number 1015 leaves at 11:10 a.m. and arrives at 13:26 p.m. Buses run to Dalhousie from Hatton's train station until early afternoon. During pilgrimage season (December to May), there are direct buses to Dalhousie from Colombo, Kandy and Nuwara Eliya. However, the scenic train route across the Hill Country is highly recommended.","The 2,243-meter (7,359 feet) Adam's Peak lies amid Sri Lanka's southern Central Highlands .

"The legislative panel investigating the George Washington Bridge scandal was unable to determine whether New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie knew about the lane closures ahead of time, but the panel will continue to push for more answers, the co-chairman of the panel told CNN. New Jersey State Assemblyman John Wisniewski, a Democrat, confirmed to CNN in a text message Thursday an earlier Wall Street Journal piece previewing the panel's report resulting from its months-long investigation into the lane closures. CNN obtained a copy of the report Friday. According to the Wall Street Journal, which received a copy of the report, it declares there was ""no conclusive evidence"" that Christie ""was or was not aware"" of the lane closures on the George Washington Bridge before or while they were happening. It also states, however, that a ""former ally"" made accusations that leave ""open the question of when the governor first learned of the closures and what he was told."" ""The report is not inconclusive,"" Wisniewski said in the text message. ""It says, among other things, that because we have been unable to interview certain witnesses, it is not possible to determine whether the Governor did or did not know about the lane closures in advance."" Asked whether the panel would continue to pursue the investigation, Wisniewski said, ""We are not done by any means."" In a separate phone exchange with CNN's Chris Frates, Wisniewski said the report will bring some new facts to light ""that will certainly raise additional questions."" The panel is waiting, he said, for the U.S. Attorney, who is doing his own investigation, to give members the go-ahead to interview several key players. The lane closures in September of last year snarled traffic in Fort Lee, N.J., in an act the report suggests was meant as political retribution against the town's Democratic mayor. Two central figures in the lane closures were not accessible to legislative investigators: David Wildstein, Christie's appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey who orchestrated the closures, and Christie's former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, who wrote an email declaring it was ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee."" Wisniewski told Frates that the report is a chronology of everything the committee has learned starting with Kelly's now infamous email, but larger questions remain over the motive of the closures. An internal investigation ordered by Christie earlier this year absolved him of responsibility as well, and many of his supporters have decried the legislative inquiry as a political witch hunt aimed at him by Democrats looking to damage him before his expected 2016 presidential run. Randy Mastro, the lead attorney for the internal investigation, argued the legislative committee's work ""has simply corroborated"" the administration's probe. ""The Committee has finally acknowledged what we reported nine months ago -- namely, that there is not a shred of evidence Governor Christie knew anything about the GWB lane realignment beforehand or that any current member of his staff was involved in that decision,"" Mastro said in a written statement. The scandal itself did indeed damage him within the GOP, raising questions among some major party donors and strategists over whether more could come of the scandal. He has, however, regained some of his stature because of his successful tenure as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, during which he raked in record-breaking fundraising hauls for the committee. A CNN/ORC poll out this week showed Christie in fourth place in the GOP field, taking 8 percent support and coming in behind former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who took first.","An investigation into Christie's knowledge of the bridge closures could not determine what he knew, when .

"It was almost midnight when the surveillance team spotted their target at the base of the cavernous luxury apartment complex. He fit the picture on the international arrest warrant which had urgently been issued just weeks previously -- a French-Algerian in his early 20s with buzz-cut hair and thick arching eyebrows. The agents, who belonged to the DCRI -- France's domestic security service, logged the time -- 23.20 on February 11, 2014 -- and immediately radioed their superiors, who told them to move in to make the arrest. When he saw them, the man fled through a gate leading to the staircases, according to French investigators. They gave chase as he clambered up the stairwell to the floors with commanding views over the marina, golf course and Mediterranean. Now that he knew they were on to him they could not afford to let him escape. The man was wanted because he was suspected of being a member of a terrorist cell that had carried out a grenade attack in Paris. But he had, according to French authorities, fled to the jihadist battlegrounds of Syria for almost a year and a half to escape arrest, and they feared he might be plotting a terrorist attack. After learning he was on his way back from Syria, they had put his father's building -- in Mandelieu-La Napoule, just up the coast from Cannes -- under surveillance in case he surfaced there, according to French security officials. Their target -- Ibrahim Boudina, a 23-year-old French national born in Algiers -- had been detected crossing into Greece five weeks previously. Greek border guards had found in his possession a USB stick with instructions for how to make homemade bombs ""in the name of Allah,"" but had not apprehended him, according to investigators. Investigators did not explain why he was allowed to continue with his journey. Details on the investigation are emerging at a time of sharply increased concern over the terrorist threat in France and other European countries. In the wake of U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and possible strikes in Syria, European counterterrorism services fear ISIS or its supporters could retaliate with attacks in Europe, a European counterterrorism official told CNN. Following a long trail . According to French security officials, Boudina had set off for Syria in late September 2012 with a childhood friend -- Abdelkader Tliba, a French-Tunisian who worked as a cook in grand restaurants on the Cannes seafront -- just days after Jeremie Louis-Sidney, an alleged fellow member of their close-knit radical circle, had thrown a grenade into a Jewish grocery store in Sarcelles, a suburb of Paris, injuring a shopper. Boudina, one of his friends later told French investigators, was longing to fight alongside jihadists in Syria, and had decided to leave before the dragnet came down, according to officials. They left just in time. On October 6, 2012, Louis-Sidney was killed in a shootout with police in Strasbourg after resisting arrest. Three days later, police recovered bags of potassium nitrate, sulfur, saltpeter, headlight bulbs and a pressure cooker belonging to Louis-Sidney's group in an underground car park in Torcy, a suburb east of Paris, according to prosecutors. Investigators say they later ascertained their targets were likely Jewish organizations. French officials called the ""Cannes-Torcy"" group the most dangerous terrorist cell uncovered in the country since the 1995 bombing of the Paris metro. A dozen men allegedly belonging to the group were arrested and placed under formal investigation on suspicion of alleged terrorism offenses in the weeks following the attack. Boudina and Tliba, who had shaved off his beard, traveled through Turkey, crossing the Syrian border near the Turkish town of Hatay, according to investigators.  According to French officials, they first joined the Syrian al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra and then are suspected of joining the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which now refers to itself as the Islamic State. French security services believed they had allegedly linked up with jihadists after wiretapping Boudina's cell phone. By early 2013 they had obtained his Syrian number by obtaining a warrant to listen to his parents' phones, according to investigators. DCRI listened in as Boudina made several calls back to his circle in France: if any others planned on traveling to Syria, they wanted to know about it, according to officials. They were also worried the duo could pose a threat if they returned home, according to security officials. While they were in Syria, the two discussed the need to ""punish"" France on social media, according to officials. Their initial aim had been to die for the cause of holy war in Syria, a close member of their circle told investigators. Soon after Boudina and Tliba fled France, police had discovered their last wills and testaments in the car of a friend, according to officials. ""I really hope to find you in paradise, where you will be my queen,"" Boudina had written to his wife in a handwritten will, according to investigators. According to officials, the same friend revealed during a series of interrogations with DCRI agents in October 2012 that Boudina and Tliba had been determined to fight in Syria ever since returning in early 2012 from a several-month-long trip to Cairo, where they had attended Islamic classes. Boudina now regarded it as his Islamic duty, the friend told the DCRI. The friend claimed their time overseas had radicalized them. The friend described Boudina as a dominant figure in a small group of like-minded radicals who hung out together after prayers in mosques in the Cannes area. These drew congregants from tougher immigrant neighborhoods just miles from the glitz of the Cote D'Azur. To kick back, the group visited a nearby river. The beach was not an option because of the bikini-clad women. The friend said Boudina tried to persuade him to travel with him to Syria, describing the paradise that would await them in the afterlife if they became martyrs and showing him videos of massacres carried out by the Assad regime. While the friend decided not to travel, he said another member of the circle joined them in Syria. The friend told the DCRI that Boudina was supportive of a string of fatal terrorist shootings carried out by the French-Algerian extremist Mohammed Merah on French soldiers and Jewish schoolchildren in southern France in March 2012, according to investigators. ""Ibrahim said if he could not do jihad on Islamic soil he would do it in France. Ibrahim compared France to the head of the serpent, which you had to cut off,"" the friend told DCRI interrogators, according to sources. ""Ibrahim spoke to me often about this Zionist area in Cannes and that if he could not go do jihad overseas it would for him be a target."" When Americans leave for jihad . The net closes in . On January 16, 2014, 13 days after Boudina was detected reentering Europe at the Greek border, Tliba was arrested at the Italian port of Ancona during an identity check and transferred to French custody, according to officials. He also had been making his way back from Syria, according to investigators. French security services feared the duo might have plans to launch an attack when they returned to France, according to counterterrorism officials, but had no idea what, if anything, was planned. Boudina first went to ground in Nice, where he was put under surveillance, according to officials, before being traced to Mandelieu-La Napoule and his father's apartment complex. As the clock ticked down to midnight on February 11, DCRI agents, in hot pursuit up the staircase, eventually caught up with Boudina between the 11th and 12th floors, and took him into custody. Boudina was placed under formal investigation on suspicion of participation in a criminal conspiracy to prepare acts of terrorism. Tliba is also under formal investigation on the same count. Both men deny the allegations against them. Their lawyers were unwilling to comment on the record to CNN. CNN contacted the prosecutor's office for comment on the case but received no reply. From American kid to jihadi to Syria . Six days after Boudina was taken into custody, police made a startling discovery. In a storage closet for technical equipment on the 13th and top floor they found a handgun, bomb-making instructions, and three soda cans filled with the high-explosive compound TATP. Screws and nails were attached to one with sticky tape as shrapnel, according to sources briefed on the investigation. French investigators maintain the items belonged to Boudina. French authorities suspect that in the 15 months Boudina spent in Syria, he learned how to make TATP, an unstable and difficult-to-transport explosive used to build detonators in multiple al Qaeda plots against the West, according to sources briefed on the investigation. Recovered from the cans were 950 grams of TATP, enough to cause significant destruction. It is not clear whether ISIS signed off on his alleged plot. One possibility is that Boudina was allegedly acting on his own steam, having obtained the training he needed in Syria, given his alleged longstanding interest in launching attacks in France. More than 800 French nationals have joined up with jihadist groups in Syria, according to officials. One former French ISIS recruit -- Mehdi Nemmouche -- allegedly shot and killed four people at a Jewish museum in Brussels in May, the first terrorist attack on European soil linked to the conflict in Syria. Nemmouche was arrested in France and extradited to face trial in Belgium. He has denied the charges. With hundreds of jihadist veterans of Syria and Iraq already back on European soil, the fear is that the Brussels attack will not be the last.

"China aims to get its citizens one step closer to the moon this month. The country's space program plans to dock its first manned spacecraft on its orbiting space laboratory in mid-June, China's state media reported Saturday. If all goes as planned, China will be the third nation after the United States and Russia to complete a manned docking. The spacecraft, called the Shenzhou-9 and its carrier rocket, the Long March-2F, were moved to a launch platform in northwest China's Gansu province Saturday to allow scientists to conduct tests before the launch, according to Xinhua. The Chinese news agency reported that female astronauts may be among the three-person crew to dock on the Tiangong-1 space lab module, which was launched into space in September. In March, Niu Hongguang, deputy commander-in-chief of China's manned space program, spoke about the possibility of including female astronauts and was quoted in Xinhua as saying the final selection will be decided ""on the very last condition."" One of the crewmembers will not board the lab, as a precaution in case of an emergency should arise, a spokesperson for the space program said in February. China has big aspirations for its space program with hopes to build a space station like the International Space Station and to conduct a manned mission to the moon. China rockets forward in race to moon . Last November, the Tiangong-1successfully completed China's first space docking mission with an unmanned spacecraft, Shenzhou-8, according to Xinhua. The efforts demonstrate ""China's continued commitment to becoming a first-class space power with an independent space capability,"" Taylor Fravel, associate professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said this year. ""This is a very exclusive club."" On Thursday in Beijing, the China National Space Administration and the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission signed a space cooperation plan through 2020, state-run China Daily reported. The agreement was signed, while Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari was visiting for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit. China's efforts come as the United States refocuses its space program toward deep space exploration, and private companies like SpaceX make strides toward the commercialization of spaceflight. Last month SpaceX's unmanned Dragon capsule completed the first ever commercial mission to the International Space Station.","The spacecraft and its carrier rocket were moved to a launch platform Saturday .

"(InStyle) -- Oscar night is Hollywood's main fashion event, and most notable on the red carpet this year was our favorite actresses stepping out in uber feminine -- not just fashion forward -- looks. Indeed, from the most delicate shades of blush to the boldest fuchsia, the red carpet turned pink! Exaggerated ruffles, soft draping, frothy fabrics, dramatic trains and Cinderella-esque silhouettes gave new meaning to the term Hollywood royalty. The few celebrities who bucked the romantic trend, including Sarah Jessica Parker, Sandra Bullock and Meryl Streep, chose sophisticated styles with retro vibes. From a timeless beauty (Demi Moore) to a graceful Hollywood icon (Meryl Streep), here are the night's fashion winners. Demi Moore . Demi Moore often chooses classic, tailored cuts, but last night she glowed in a stunning blush-toned Atelier Versace silk organza gown with petal-like tiers of ruffles. She finished off this softer look with Van Cleef & Arpels tassel earrings and diamond cuffs, a gold leather Salvatore Ferragamo clutch and dress-matching Versace satin sandals. Diane Kruger . The ever-flawless Diane Kruger turned to her favorite designer Karl Lagerfeld for her cream and black chiffon gown from Chanel Haute Couture. Both edgy and feminine, the design featured a pleated and ruffled skirt that led into a bow-bedecked mermaid train. See more dresses from the 2010 Academy Awards . Jennifer Lopez . We love the way Jennifer Lopez commands the red carpet in dramatic dresses, and her choice this year was no exception. Yet rather than going sexy (down-to-there Versace, anyone?), the diva went spectacular in a full-on princess-shaped icy pink Armani Prive confection with a Swarovski crystal-studded waterfall train. Charlize Theron . While still incredibly feminine, Charlize Theron's Dior Haute Couture gown was also most daring with its rosette-bedecked bustline. The custom-designed dress combined a curve-hugging lilac column with a wow-worthy train of amethyst satin. Anna Kendrick . Talk about pretty -- nominee Anna Kendrick selected a pale pink couture gown from Elie Saab that featured beautiful details like hand-draped rosettes and lace edging. The ""Up in the Air"" star added matching platform sandals and delicate Kwiat diamonds. Oscars: Top 7 Fashion Trends . Zoe Saldana . ""Avatar"" beauty Zoe Saldana walked the red carpet in one of the night's most memorable gowns: a purple ombre design from Givenchy Haute Couture that paired a flower-like tulle skirt with a shimmering bodice. We loved the artistic take on traditional feminine flourishes. Penelope Cruz . On the sultry end of the romantic trend was Best Supporting Actress nominee Penelope Cruz in a shape-draping duchesse satin Donna Karan design. After an awards season of black and black, it was a pleasure to see the ""Nine"" star in a deep shade of bordeaux. Oscars: Best Hair and Makeup . Sarah Jessica Parker . We've come to expect the unexpected from Sarah Jessica Parker (and are never disappointed). This year, Parker skipped the frills in favor of a '60s-inspired Chanel Haute Couture column gown topped with elaborate silver embroidery. The shape, the color and the details were simply perfect, as was her stunning mix of jewelry: a stack of Fred Leighton bracelets paired with a spiked crescent ring. Sandra Bullock . It was Sandra Bullock's night both inside the Kodak Theatre and on the red carpet. Eschewing pink, the Best Actress winner looked luminous in an ethereal silver beaded Marchesa column with a peek-a-boo lace bodice. She accented the stunning design with understated diamond jewelry and a textured minaudiere. Best Jewelry at the Oscars . Meryl Streep . Nominee Meryl Streep embodied the iconic era of elegance in a strong-shouldered '40s-inspired custom design from Chris March. The ""Julie & Julia"" lead chose similarly fuss-free accessories including a Swarovski silver crystal mesh clutch and diamond and black onyx Fred Leighton jewels.

"The tributes to Robin Williams flow from around the world as stunned friends and family search for answers about why the comic legend would take his own life. Investigators believe Williams, 63, used a belt to hang himself from a bedroom door sometime between late Sunday and when his personal assistant found him just before noon Monday at his home in California, according to Marin County Assistant Deputy Chief Coroner Lt. Keith Boyd. Boyd would not confirm or deny whether Williams left behind a letter, saying that investigators would discuss  ""the note or a note"" later. The coroner's investigation ""revealed he had been seeking treatment for depression,"" Boyd told reporters. ""He has been battling severe depression of late,"" Williams' media representative, Mara Buxbaum, told CNN on Monday.  ""This is a tragic and sudden loss."" The autopsy completed Tuesday morning showed ""no indication of a struggle or physical altercation,"" which was consistent with the death being a suicide, Boyd said. The personal assistant found Williams ""clothed in a seated position, unresponsive, and with a belt secured around his neck with the other end of the belt wedged between the closed closet door and door frame,"" he said. Williams' left wrist had cuts, Boyd said. A pocket knife was found near his body, and a red material consistent with dried blood was found on the knife, Boyd said. He said tests will be conducted to determine whether the substance is blood. Williams was last seen alive at about 10:30 p.m. Sunday, by his wife, when she went to bed, Boyd said. He apparently went into a bedroom at an unknown time after that.  His wife left the home at about 10:30 a.m. Monday, assuming Williams was still asleep. Williams' personal assistant, concerned because he wasn't responding to knocks on his door, entered the room and found him dead at about 11:45 a.m., Boyd said. It will take several weeks for toxicology test results to show whether Williams was under the influence of drugs or alcohol when he died, Boyd said. Full of talent, full of demons, full of heart . The actor made at least two trips to rehab for drug treatment, including a visit this summer, and he underwent heart surgery in 2009. Williams was remembered fondly by actors, comedians, fans, even the president of the United States -- who described him as ""an airman, a doctor, a genie, a nanny, a president, a professor, a bangarang Peter Pan (who) was one of a kind."" ""He made us laugh,"" Obama said. ""He made us cry.ÃÂ He gave his immeasurable talent freely and generously to those who needed it most -- from our troops stationed abroad to the marginalized on our own streets."" His loss was felt deeply in many circles, but no more so than his own family. His wife Susan Scheider -- a graphic designer whom he married in October 2011 -- asked the world to focus ""not on Robin's death, but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions."" Others in his family, including his three children and an ex-wife, praised him as a warm, loving man who always tried ""to bring joy to"" those around him, as eldest son Zak noted. ""Dad was, is and always will be one of the kindest, most generous, gentlest souls I've ever known,"" his daughter Zelda said. ""... I know ... not just my world, but the the entire world is forever a little darker, less colorful and less full of laughter in his absence. We'll just have to work twice as hard to fill it back up again."" All he needed was an audience of one . On Tuesday, someone who knew Robin Williams well described the man behind the legend. ""There had to be two people in the room"" with him, his friend Bob Zmuda told CNN's ""New Day.""  ""Then you were an audience, and then he came alive."" But one-on-one, Zmuda said, Williams ""had no social skills.  He couldn't handle it. ...  I knew this man for 35 years and yet it was like I was in an elevator with a stranger."" Zmuda, a comedy writer, created Comic Relief, a program that raised funds for those in need through comedy.  Williams hosted it, along with Billy Crystal and Whoopi Goldberg. Sarah Michelle Gellar played Williams' daughter in the CBS comedy ""The Crazy Ones,"" which was recently canceled after one season. She told People magazine that ""to everyone he worked with, he was the best boss anyone had ever known,"" and both an inspiration and father figure to her.  ""And to his family, I thank them for letting us know him and seeing the joy they brought him."" In character, Williams warned against suicide . Williams was known to be generous to fellow stand-up comedians. ""Riffing with Robin Williams was extremely invigorating -- and extremely exhausting,"" comic Gilbert Gottfried wrote in a column for CNN.com.  ""I knew I had to be on my toes every second. And when we would actually connect onstage, it was electric for me."" ""I've known people who have committed suicide, and my shock always reveals how little I knew about them,"" Gottfried wrote. In the 2009 film ""World's Greatest Dad,"" Williams played a man named Lance Clayton -- and delivered a line now making the rounds online: ""If you're that depressed, reach out to someone.  And remember: Suicide is a permanent solution to temporary problems."" From Julliard to 'Happy Days' Born in Chicago on July 21, 1951, Williams studied theater at Juilliard School before taking his stand-up act to nightclubs.  He was cast as Mork, an alien visitor to Earth, for a 1978 episode of television's ""Happy Days."" ""Happy Days"" star Henry Winkler said he ""realized I was in the presence of greatness"" at Williams' first rehearsal as Mork. ""I just realized my only job is to keep a straight face,"" said Winkler, who played ""The Fonz.""  ""And it was impossible. Because no matter what you said to him, no matter what line you gave to him, he took it in, processed it, and then it flew out of his mouth, never the same way twice. And it was incredibly funny every time."" It is ""unimaginable that this is the reality today, that this incredible human being, incredible, delicate, funny, dramatic human being is gone,"" Winkler said. The role led to the spinoff show ""Mork & Mindy"" which showcased Williams' unusual comic improvisation talents from 1978 through 1982. He proved his dramatic acting skills in ""Good Will Hunting,"" a 1997 film that earned him a best supporting actor Oscar. His memorable movies over the past three decades include ""Good Morning, Vietnam,"" ""Dead Poets Society,"" ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and ""The Birdcage."" Williams credited the influence of Jonathan Winters' comic irreverence and quirky characters as a great influence on his comedy.  The connection between the two was completed when Winters was cast as Williams' son on ""Mork & Mindy."" When Winters died in 2013, Williams said he was ""my idol, then he was my mentor and amazing friend."" He tweeted that Winters was his ""Comedy Buddha."" Williams and his ""Mork & Mindy"" co-star Pam Dawber reunited on TV earlier this year on an episode of the CBS comedy ""The Crazy Ones."" Williams' fans can look forward to four more movie appearances coming to theaters, including another installment in the ""Night at the Museum"" franchise. Dawber summed up the feelings of many in a simple statement: ""I am completely and totally devastated. What more can be said?"" Once on the TV program ""Inside the Actors Studio,"" Williams was asked, ""If Heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the pearly gates?"" After a joke about a concert including Mozart and Elvis, he added, ""to know that there's laughter."" Complete coverage on Robin Williams .

"When Melissa Stegner thinks about the days after Christmas in 2007, it's mostly a blur with a few focused, unavoidable truths. Her dad, Scott, and big brother, Sean, had dropped her grandmother at home. As father and son headed back to Virginia, a Cadillac Escalade crossed into the southbound lane and struck the Stegners' Chrysler minivan head-on. The SUV driver was drunk, a repeat offender. Her dad and brother died before rescue workers arrived. ""I was totally naive to drunk driving and the dangers of alcohol,"" said Melissa, now 17. ""I didn't know how to deal with it. Nobody knew how to deal with it."" Years later, her story precedes her in the high school hallways. She thinks she'll always be known as the girl whose family was killed by a drunken driver. She'd always thought of herself as shy, but the worst moments of her life have become a reason to speak up. She's talked about her father and brother in courtrooms, and to convicted drunken drivers. She spoke this year at the national conference of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Perhaps most importantly, she's talks about it at school, to teens, to anybody her age who will listen. She believes talking about it prevents more accidents and helps her heal. ""I remind my friends that no matter what, drinking and driving is not OK. There's no dumber decision you can make,"" she said. Even in high school, where everybody feels invincible, where she knows people party with beer, ""I've had people come up to me and thank me,"" she said. They're exactly the conversations advocates against underage drinking and drunken driving want to happen more. After all the laws, stats and warnings, they're learning that peers and parents are among the most powerful influences on whether teens drink alcohol. A report released last week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed the number of teens who drink and drive dropped by 54% in the last 20 years. Ninety percent of high school students surveyed said they don't drink and drive at all. For all the improvement, the CDC estimated that high school teens still drank alcohol and drove 2.4 million times every month in 2011. And young drivers are 17 times more likely to die in a crash when there's alcohol involved. ""Because of that heightened risk, we can never be complacent,"" said Ralph Hingson, a director at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Putting a face on the warnings and statistics can help, he said. ""I testified probably 50 times to state legislatures about different interventions you could do to reduce the problems,"" Hingson said. ""I'm not nearly as effective with the data alone as when people come and tell stories. It's people, not just numbers."" In 2008, Mothers Against Drunken Driving members began to take a closer look at the research about what would really stop kids from drinking, and from driving afterward. They'd successfully advocated for graduated licenses for new drivers and zero-tolerance laws for drivers younger than 21 with alcohol in their systems and needed a next step. ""Over many years, we were doing what sounded like it would work. Some of it did work,"" MADD National President Jan Withers said. But not everything. Research helped them realize schools assemblies didn't sway teens as much as a conversation with their parents, or an exchange with a classmate. They're trying to get kids and parents to rethink how they talk to each other about alcohol, no matter how awkward it might feel. ""Parents believe the peer pressure is so great that they don't have as much influence on their teens as they actually do,"" Withers said. Empower them, and ""it moves into the power of community -- students and adults work together."" Others around the country are coming to the same conclusion. In Montana, Mariah's Challenge asks people younger than 21 to promise publicly they won't drink or get in a car with someone who has. The program was was founded by Jimm Kilmer, Chad Okrusch and Leo McCarthy, a 2012 Top 10 CNN Hero. McCarthy's 14-year-old daughter, Mariah, was killed in 2007 when an underage drunken driver ran into her as she walked along the sidewalk a block from her house. Kilmer's and Okrusch's daughters were injured, too. ""If you stick with me for four years,"" McCarthy told the crowd during Mariah's eulogy, ""don't use alcohol, don't use illicit drugs but give back to your community, work with your parents and talk to your parents, I'll be there with a bunch of other people to give you money."" Since then, more than 140 high school graduates in different communities around the country have gotten $1,000 scholarships from the program. At Melissa Stegner's high school in Virginia, she launched a chapter of Students Against Destructive Decisions that now boasts about 30 members. She was also among the first to join MADD and State Farm's Power of You(th) National Teen Influencer Group this year. The whole idea: No matter the stats, keep talking about drunken driving. Later this month, during MADD's annual high school Red Ribbon Week, the group will distribute a new guide for teens, written with guidance from Melissa and other young people. It reminds students that the majority of teens don't drink, and even fewer binge drink; that teens react differently to alcohol than adults; that there could be major legal consequences to drinking. It offers ideas about talking to parents, and resources to call if a family member has a drinking problem. ""We're doing everything we can to empower youth to make sure they know they have influence over their own lives,"" Withers said. ""We still want to be constantly talking about the issue."" Withers, after all, has her own story. When her kids were growing up in Maryland, they were never allowed to drink at home or to join their friends for Ocean City getaways some saw as a rite of passage. They'd all signed contracts that said they wouldn't drink and drive and promised to call if they needed a ride. One night in 1992, her 15-year-old daughter, Alisa, spent the night at a friend's house. The girls went out with another group of friends. The driver had been drinking. Alisa was killed. Looking back, Withers said, she thought she'd talked to her kids about drinking and driving. Now she knows it wasn't often enough. ""I had the attitude that 'They know how I feel about it,' "" Withers said. ""I believe she had some of the tools -- she certainly didn't drink that night. ""But still Alisa got in the car.""","CDC: The number of teens who drink and drive has plummeted 54% in 20 years .

"David Petraeus' resignation was not linked to the September attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, and he never passed classified information to the woman he was having an affair with, the former CIA director told an HLN journalist. ""In our first conversation,"" Kyra Phillips, from CNN's sister network HLN, said Thursday, Petraeus ""had told me he had engaged in something dishonorable. He sought to do the honorable thing in response -- and that was to come forward. He was very clear that he screwed up terribly ... even felt fortunate to have a wife who is far better than he deserves."" Phillips, who has interviewed Petraeus in war zones, initially reached out to him to express shock at the news of the affair that derailed a highly decorated career in the military and CIA. Among other things, Petraeus said he has not talked with Paula Broadwell, his biographer and the woman with whom he had an affair, since the scandal broke. What the Petraeus scandal says about digital spying and your e-mail . ""He insisted to me that he has never passed classified information to Paula Broadwell,"" Phillips said. ""He said this has nothing to do with Benghazi, and he wants to testify. He will testify."" Petraeus is expected to appear Friday before the House and Senate intelligence committees, aiming to clear up ""a lot of misrepresentations of what he told Congress initially"" about who was behind the attack, a source who has spoken with him said. Meanwhile, the ""general conduct"" of Petraeus is the focus of a new investigation launched by the CIA's inspector general, said CIA spokesman Preston Golson said. Among other aspects, this inquiry will explore whether Petraeus used CIA resources in carrying out his affair with Broadwell, a U.S. official said. In his first public comments on the matter, Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday that Justice Department officials did not tell the White House about related FBI investigations -- including looking into possible breaches of top-secret information -- because it was determined national security was never at risk. ""Had we made the determination that a threat to national security existed, we would of course have made that known to the president and appropriate members on (Capitol) Hill,"" Holder told reporters in New Orleans. ""But as we went through the investigation ... we felt very secure in the knowledge that a national security threat did not exist."" The former CIA chief didn't try to persuade his bosses to let him keep his job once he admitted the affair, and ""has maintained to me all along this was a personal failing,"" Phillips said. The extramarital relationship ended months ago. But it continues to make waves in Washington, as suspicions ripple through the capital about the timing of its revelation and Petraeus' scheduled testimony into the Benghazi attack. Top U.S. general caught up in scandal . In addition, the chain of fiery e-mails that led the FBI to discover the sexual indiscretion has caused collateral damage, putting the imminent nomination of Gen. John Allen as NATO commander on hold, until the nature of his e-mail exchange and relationship with a military ""socialite"" have been clarified. The FBI investigation was triggered by Frederick Humphries, a veteran agent for the Tampa FBI field office, who is a friend of Jill Kelley, said Lawrence Berger, general counsel for the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association. The tricky nature of investigating Gen. Allen's e-mails . Kelley, who was a volunteer at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida, contacted Humphries about anonymous e-mails that questioned her character, a U.S. official and a source close to Kelley said. Humphries took the information on the e-mails to the ""appropriate components,"" Berger said. ""He reported it to the proper channels and had no further part in the case."" Asked about reports that Humphries pestered the agents assigned to the case for information, Berger said that wasn't true. ""I don't accept that. He followed proper protocols,"" he said. However, the FBI is reviewing Humphries' actions, a law enforcement official said. The agency will look at whether Humphries followed proper procedures in speaking to some members of Congress about his concerns about how the FBI was handling Kelley's case. The review will include a look at whether the agent went through the proper chain of command at the FBI to raise his concerns, the official said. Humphries is still on duty in the Tampa office. Reports by officials familiar with the e-mail messages between Kelley and Allen give conflicting impressions about their potentially inappropriate nature -- with one U.S. official saying ""John Allen would be very embarrassed by them"" and a senior official close to the general saying they don't point to a sexual or romantic relationship. That Allen remains in command in Afghanistan suggests that there is no criminal issue, a U.S. official told CNN. But the official said the Defense Department's inspector general could still find evidence of criminal conduct. The investigation into the e-mails connected to Allen and Kelley led to the discovery of the affair between Petraeus, 60, and Broadwell, 40. The fallout has been widespread, but there are signs that the FBI investigation is winding down, said CNN contributor Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director. There is no indication of criminal activity on the part of Petraeus or that he disclosed classified information, senior federal law enforcement officials told Fuentes. Kelleys' financial troubles . Kelley hosted top military brass at her home, but it's unclear if Allen or Petraeus were aware that her family was experiencing financial difficulties or of the unusual background of a charity they founded. Public records show that in April 2010, about six years after the Kelleys bought their $1.5 million home, Regions Bank filed to foreclose on the property, saying the couple hadn't made a mortgage payment since September 2009. Florida records show there are at least nine lawsuits involving money and the Kelley family, including unpaid credit card bills of more than $320,000. Public records also show the Kelleys founded a cancer research charity in 2005 called the Doctor Kelley Cancer Foundation. In a  2008 federal tax return, the Kelleys' charity reported it spent the exact amount of money it raised:$157,000. The charity's money paid for parties, transportation, legal bills and other administrative costs. There is no evidence any of the money was used for cancer research or caring for cancer patients. Asked for the Kelleys' side of the story, a source close to the family told CNN the source didn't have enough information to respond. Broadwell's security clearance . It appears unlikely that Broadwell would face prosecution in the case, a senior law enforcement official said. Officials continued to review materials taken from her home, and the FBI needed a presumption that there were classified materials there when they obtained a search warrant. But it appears that any violations of releasing classified information appear not to be egregious. Before the warrant was issued, FBI agents approached high-level Pentagon officials to ask them if material they had tied to Broadwell could be considered classified, two U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the case said. Defense Department officials said they were classified. As a military reservist, Broadwell had security clearance but presumably would have no clear reason to have classified information in her home, the officials said. The military has many safeguards in place, including not allowing data to be saved on hard drives and restricting what can be sent out by e-mail, to prevent secret info from getting out. Broadwell's security clearance with the government has since been suspended, pending the outcome of the investigation, said the officials. The relevance of Paula Broadwell's security clearance . Petraeus reportedly has not been following the media firestorm over the extramarital affair that led to his resignation. ""He wants to maintain a distance and focus on his family at this time,"" his aide, retired Col. Peter Mansoor, has said. The affair with Broadwell ended about four months ago, Mansoor said, though the two remained in contact afterward, as she needed his help to finish her dissertation.

"My mother-in-law and I talk about nearly everything. But when I mentioned to her recently that I was working on a story about emergency preparedness, I realized that's one thing we've never discussed -- even though she lives nearby and would certainly factor into our family plan. ""If a disaster strikes, where would we meet?"" we asked each other. ""Who would we call? What would we take with us?"" A new national advertising campaign shared with CNN exclusively ahead of its official launch Wednesday aims to get families like my own at least talking about what we'd do in the face of a natural disaster or other emergency. ""This is a pretty fearful topic for a lot of parents,"" said Priscilla Natkins, executive vice president and director of client services for the Ad Council, the private nonprofit group spearheading the campaign along with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ""This is not something they want to think about or necessarily talk about with their kids,"" she said. The Ad Council, which has produced many memorable PSA campaigns, ranging from Smokey Bear's warnings about forest fires to the ""Friends Don't Let Friends Drive Drunk"" series, conducted a national survey on emergency preparedness. The survey included 800 adults. Be prepared for any home emergency . Six out of 10 American families said they did not have a family emergency plan, according to the survey. Only 19% felt they were ""very prepared"" for a disaster. ""What we have found (is) despite our best efforts and we have made some impact, we have some terrific messaging out there over the years, not enough people and not enough parents are actually doing what they should be doing in terms of being prepared,"" said Natkins. To try to change that, the public service announcements are not your typical PSAs. They are light-hearted, funny and unconventional, with scenes such as a family proudly talking about how unprepared they are. ""I'll pack the dead batteries,"" says the son after his father asks what each family member will do in preparation for an emergency. ""I'll only put what I don't need into a duffel bag,"" says the daughter, with her mom adding, ""Great, that's totally unhelpful."" ""We think these ads will resonate with audiences because we think the messaging comes from insights that are so universally important to people,"" said Val DiFebo, CEO of Deutsch NY, the agency that created the ads pro bono to help raise awareness. ""The fact that most people will admit they don't have a plan or that they can just wing it, which is exactly what we talk about in these ads, is (how) you get people to pay attention and act and say it's time."" Digital tips for the next Sandy-like emergency . The PSAs are timed to release right before the 10th annual National Preparedness Month in September, an initiative managed and sponsored by FEMA to encourage Americans to prepare for emergencies in their homes, schools, businesses and places of worship. ""What we try to get people to understand is that number one, not all disasters come with warning labels,"" said Darryl Madden, director of FEMA's Ready campaign. ""What we also try to make people understand is that don't think of it in terms of the Katrinas or of the Sandys, but think about other events that could happen in your community that present a certain risk that you need to be prepared for."" The ads, which will run and air in advertising time and space donated by various media outlets, encourage Americans to visit FEMA's website for kids. The site, with more parent- and kid-friendly content coming September 1, includes information such as a downloadable family emergency plan and guidance on how to talk to kids about emergencies in an age-appropriate fashion. DiFebo said that her agency's strategy was to create a sense of urgency without going overboard. ""What you don't want to do is be so alarmist that people don't want to pay attention to the message or they say this is just too scary for me and it's too scary for my kids so I'm not going there,"" she said. ""That's really the biggest mistake you can make."" Does your emergency kit have a cell phone? While my mother-in-law and I had never talked about what we'd do in the event of an emergency and my family still does not have a disaster plan, the subject of emergency preparedness is very close to our hearts. A dear family friend, John Solomon, was the founder of a comprehensive blog on the topic, regularly read by FEMA and other emergency preparedness officials, called In Case of Emergency, Read Blog -- A Citizen's Eye View of Preparedness. He created the blog as he worked on a book on simple steps to prepare families for terrorist attacks and natural disasters. Sadly, John never finished that book. He died nearly two years ago from complications after a bone marrow transplant for leukemia. FEMA has since created an award in John's name, and so has the New York City Office of Emergency Management. John's family and friends have also created a fellowship program in his name -- the first student fellowship in New York City government specifically focused on emergency management. I can't think of a nicer way to honor our dear friend than to finally create an emergency plan of our own and share it with our girls -- tonight.

"(CNN) -- The leader of an apocalyptic New Mexico church who claims to be the Messiah was arrested Tuesday on sex charges, state police said. Wayne Bent, who also goes by the name Michael Travesser, was arrested at the compound that is home to his Lord Our Righteousness Church, called Strong City by members. He was being interviewed, state police spokesman Peter Olson said. The arrests come after three children were removed from the compound late last month. A post on the group's Web site said Bent was arrested Tuesday morning. ""I was told by the agent in charge of the case that the arrest warrant specified charges of three counts of sexual contact with a minor, and three counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor,"" said the post, written by an unnamed follower. ""The bail was set at half a million dollars."" The writer said sect members were questioned at a state police office in Clayton, New Mexico, and promised to update the site with ""a more complete response to these false charges."" The Lord Our Righteousness Church was founded in 1987 by former Seventh-day Adventists, according to the group's Web site. ""Since that time, many have joined who do not have their roots in Adventism."" Bent said on the Web site that God revealed to him in 2000 that he is the Messiah. A post from Monday written by Bent said, ""The current upheaval over me and the present contest is well under way. It was the same for Jesus. Jesus had not committed any crimes, so the authorities had to invent some crimes to crucify him over. ""It is the same for me also,"" Bent wrote. ""I have committed no crimes, but many crimes are being imagined and concocted in the minds of men to try and kill me again. Men are so stupid, though, for they do not know that they cannot kill Spirit."" Last month, authorities removed two girls and a boy from the compound. The reasons for their removal are not publicly known, but the removals gained attention because they came after more than 400 children were removed from the Texas ranch of an offshoot Mormon sect that practices polygamy. Those children remain in state custody. Bent has acknowledged having sex with his followers, but authorities will not divulge who the alleged victims are. A former member of the Lord Our Righteousness Church, however, told CNN affiliate KOAT that he left because Bent wanted to sleep with his daughters. John Sayer said he split with the church after 16 years when Bent told him he was supposed to sleep with seven virgins -- and that two of them were to be Sayer's daughters, then 14 and 15 years old. He said he told Bent that it wasn't right and that he, his wife and his daughters left the compound. Sayer told KOAT that his youngest daughter later returned and was one of the three removed by authorities. In posts on the group's Web site, Bent wrote that the three children were ""abducted."" ""The state has made its move, and now God will make his,"" he said. The Lord Our Righteousness Church is to be featured Wednesday on a National Geographic Channel program, ""Inside the Cult."" In a video clip of the show posted on the channel's Web site, Bent and some young female followers admit that the young women lay with him while naked but deny sex took place. ""It was God,"" Bent said in the video clip. ""God came down on them and told them to do it."" A posting from a teenage girl on the compound Web site denied that she was molested, saying that her ""lying with"" Bent was not sexual. She was one of the three later removed. Bent had predicted that the world would end October 31, 2007. A post to the site in March said, however:  ""Now we are in the time of 'the eighth day' -- Shemini Atzaret -- the day after the Feast of Tabernacles, when God said, 'Stay with me one more day.' Now we are in the time that Shemini Atzaret foreshadowed, and Father has been saying to us, 'Stay with me one more year.' ... It is the time of the 'last trump.' In the scriptures, it is 'that day' when the final judgment of man is carried out."" Also on the site is a message to the media, saying no interviews will be given. ""I know very well who the media represents,"" Bent wrote. ""I have no illusions regarding a free press. The press is only an arm of the beast."" He continued, ""I do not speak to, nor do I negotiate with terrorists, who are holding my children hostage. I will speak with the media when they let my children go, permanently.""","Wayne Bent picked up at the former ranch where he and his followers live .

"Some 6.8 million college students will graduate in China this summer, an exhilarating time for students and their families alike. I know the feeling: Michelle, my 21-year-old daughter, has just graduated from college too. When I got my history diploma at Peking University in 1981, the only memorable ceremony we had was a group photo with fellow history majors and our teachers. Over the years, graduations from Chinese universities have become elaborate affairs with students dressed in black gowns strutting the red carpet at formal ceremonies, before posing for the obligatory group pictures. This year, some students are breaking with convention -- striving to project their individuality, exercise free speech or simply to be a bit naughty and different. Several photos recently posted on Chinese micro-blogging sites show graduates illustrate this. One particularly eye-catching example shows advertising majors at Jinan University in Guangzhou standing in front of a banner which reads ""Jinan University Advertising Department, you f***ed my youth!"" Each graduate also holds a printout expressing his or her personal wish, such as finding a wealthy wife. The picture predictably attracted a huge response. ""It is innovation,"" gushed one micro-blogger. ""It is freedom."" ""What a great campaign by ad majors,"" enthused Bill Bishop, an independent media consultant in Beijing. ""Any ad agency would be lucky to have young folks who can create such a stir online so quickly."" Not everyone is impressed. ""Now the graduation photos of college students excessively pursue unconventional and new things in order to be different,"" said blogger Liang Mutian. ""It's a bit too much!"" Chinese writer and cultural critic Liu Yang agreed. ""If I hire people, I wouldn't hire any students from this university and would put this university on the blacklist."" But Liu's comments also came under fire. ""Why not look at the question with a more relaxed perspective?"" asked one netizen known as Luzhou Gudao. ""Maybe this last craziness will become the students' precious memories."" Another, called Jellyhahaha, wrote: ""Come on, put me on the blacklist too. This picture shows the spirit of fighting for freedom in this so-called 'harmonious country.' I think the future of China can be even better if it is determined by these graduates instead of those treacherous fakers."" For some observers, the whole debate is about China's generation gap. The older generation grew up experiencing the poverty and chaos of the Cultural Revolution. Governed by rigid rules and puritan conventions, they typically followed rules, or at least feigned compliance. Three decades of economic reform and the ""open-door"" policy have brought higher living standards, a modern lifestyle and more freedom. Traditional Chinese reticence is disappearing as a result. Meanwhile, only children dominate the current generation of young Chinese -- a legacy of China's one-child policy, instituted in 1978. They belong to a generation for whom prosperity and personal freedom are more the norm, rather the exception. China's opening to the outside world has made them better informed, extremely curious and adventurous. Most of this year's graduating class belongs to the ""jiu ling hou,"" or post-90s generation. Critics stereotype them as self-centered, naÃÂ¯ve, spoiled and rebellious. They are also labeled as lazy, promiscuous and confused. But others describe them as intelligent, innovative, curious and tech-savvy. ""These are misconceptions and sweeping over-generalizations,"" Zhao Ding, a 26-year-old white collar worker in Beijing.  ""We are different but we are maturing."" A survey conducted by the Horizon Research Group, a Beijing-based independent research firm, found that among 2,099 university and middle school students sampled from China's five largest cities, urban Chinese born in the 1990s have more disposable money and greater say in family spending. The survey also showed this generation still retains a realistic attitude about consumption, despite being portrayed as the ""spoiled generation."" ""It's just a label,"" said Zhang Dayu, 20, who is graduating this month. ""Older generations harbor stereotypes of our generation, saying we are extravagant, we are not socially responsible. Not true."" But Zhang concedes many of his contemporaries are self-centered. ""We are more individualistic,"" he said. ""We have a strong desire to express ourselves in unique and sometimes crazy ways."" This is why some students have posted various crazy -- even brazen -- photos on microblogs. One shows a man running naked, supposedly celebrating his graduation on the campus of Fudan University, a top-rated school in Shanghai, while another shows a group of youths in their graduation gowns posing for a picture while the building behind them appears to be on fire. ""In most cases, it's just people wanting fame -- using the pretext of protest in some cases,"" said Eric Fish, a graduate student in journalism at Tsinghua University. ""With the graduation photos, it just seems like what graduates would normally do in a lot of other countries."" Why is this significant? ""It perhaps says something about the freedom these young people feel now, especially when they're graduating and free from school authorities. I doubt some of the behavior in these pictures would have been tolerated 10 or 20 years ago,"" Fish said. ""This is just the result of young Chinese people starting to enjoy many of the same personal freedoms as their peers abroad: silly, naughty photos are a part of student life everywhere, and China is no different,"" explained Jeremy Goldkorn, founder of Danwei.org, a website and research firm that tracks the Chinese media and Internet. Compared to their American counterparts, Zhao Ding thinks her contemporaries are still rather conservative. ""The spirit is the same,"" said the 26-year-old literature graduate. ""Before you enter the adult world, where there are rules and conventions, you savor the last chance and last moment to indulge in teen spirit."" For some, the reminders of rules have come quickly. Many graduates have been pressured to delete their ""crazy"" pictures from their microblogs.","Some young students in China are using their graduation photos to project their individuality .
Posted on social media, photos show students with provocative signs or running naked through their campus .
Critics say they excessively pursue unconventional and new things in order to be different .

"A massive church was razed to the ground this week in Wenzhou, a coastal Chinese city nicknamed the ""Jerusalem of the East"" for its large Christian population. Local officials responsible for the demolition say the church was an illegal structure that was four times the permitted structure size. But Christian groups are concerned that the demolition signals an official campaign against religious organizations. The Sanjiang Church took 12 years and 30 million yuan ($4.7 million) to build, reports Chinese media. Its soaring spires were a symbol of worship in a city that is fifteen percent Christian. The church's demolition on Monday was preceded by a month-long standoff between supporters of the church and local authorities, with supporters occupying the church to protest its destruction. The church was originally a government-approved project under the official ""Three-Self Patriotic Movement,"" a state-sanctioned Protestant church. Last September it was lauded by the local government as a model engineering project. But the official rhetoric has since changed entirely. Jin Leibo, a spokesperson from the propaganda department of Yongjia County, where Sanjiang Church was located, told CNN that the church was destroyed as it was ""illegal."" ""The building area should be within 1,881 square meters, but they built 7,928 square meters illegally,"" Jin said. The church was asked to ""self-rectify"" by April 22, but workers only managed to tear down 500 square meters by deadline, according to officials. By Monday evening the church had been flattened by bulldozers. Five local government officials are currently under investigation in relation to the illegal construction of the church, according to Jin. One official was arrested, and another is in custody. Representatives of the church could not be reached for comment by CNN. U.S.-based Christian rights group China Aid says the faithful are worried that the church demolition could be a sign that the government is tightening its grip over the spread of Christianity in China. The organization claims that churches in different parts of Wenzhou and Hangzhou are currently ""facing persecution"" as a result of a provincial campaign against religious structures that was set into motion after Zhejiang Party Secretary Xia Baolong visited churches across the province and deemed them ""too conspicuous."" Under Communist Party rule since 1949, China is officially an atheist country, but Christianity is growing. According to the Pew Research Center, China's Christian population had reached 67 million by 2010, the second largest in Asia.","$4.7 million landmark church has been demolished in China .

"The matchup in the title game of the new college football playoff system likely wouldn't have happened in past years. Second-ranked Oregon and fourth-ranked Ohio State will play for the championship after winning the initial semifinal games in the first College Football Playoff. Oregon crushed undefeated and defending national champ Florida State 59-20 in the Rose Bowl on Thursday then Ohio State continued its surge by edging No. 1 Alabama 42-35 in the Sugar Bowl. Under the former system, the Bowl Championship Series, FSU and Alabama probably would have met in the final game. In the first semifinal, Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota completed 26 of 36 passes for 338 yards and two touchdowns for Oregon (13-1). He also ran for one score. ""You prepare all week to find success. And to execute the way we did, it definitely feels good,"" he told reporters. ""Hopefully we can take a little bit of this momentum heading into the next game."" Oregon running backs Royce Freeman and Thomas Tyner each scored on two touchdown runs as the Ducks ended the Seminoles 29-game winning streak. Florida State (13-1), the defending national champion, was done in by five turnovers. The miscues included a fumble in the third quarter by quarterback Jameis Winston that was turned into a back-breaking 58-yard touchdown return by Ducks linebacker Tony Washington. Oregon scored four TDs in the third period to lead 45-20 going into the fourth. ""We just turned the ball over too many times. We had one of the worst quarters we have ever had,"" Florida State head coach Jimbo Fisher said.  ""They made the plays, and they converted."" Winston, the 2013 Heisman Trophy winner, was 29 of 45 for 348 yards with one touchdown and one interception. Bleacher Report: Highlights from the Rose Bowl . In the second semifinal, running back Ezekiel Elliott rushed for 230 yards on 20 carries and had two touchdowns for Ohio State (13-1). The key score came on an 85-yard bolt to the end zone. ""Playing for each other. That's how we did it,"" Ohio State coach Urban Meyer said. Alabama (12-2) gave up 537 yards of offense to Ohio State. ""It was our goal to play our best in this game so we would have an opportunity to play in a national championship game, but we obviously didn't do the things that we needed to do,"" Alabama coach Nick Saban said. ""But I think there are a lot of winners on this team and I don't think that you necessarily need to get a trophy to be a winner."" Bleacher Report: Highlights from the Sugar Bowl .

"An Egyptian administrative court issued an order Tuesday banning virginity tests for female detainees, months after several women alleged they were subjected to such examinations following a March protest in Cairo's Tahrir Square. The ruling comes in the case of Samira Ibrahim, a 25-year-old marketing manager who took the country's military led-government to court in August, alleging she was among those subjected to the test after her arrest during the March 9 protest. She said she faced death threats after bringing the case. ""Justice has been served today,"" Ibrahim told CNN. ""These tests are a crime and also do not comply with the constitution, which states equality between men and woman. I will not give up my rights as a woman or a human being."" Aly Hassan, a judicial consultant affiliated with Ministry of Justice, said the order only affects the use of such tests in military prisons and on women in temporary detention. ""Those tests are not considered a crime or else the file would be in the Criminal Court,"" Hassan said. ""It's the circumstances of the alleged test that may be in question here."" In March, the human rights group Amnesty International reported that Egyptian troops beat, shocked and strip-searched women arrested during the protest in Cairo and forced them to submit to virginity tests. Egyptian authorities initially denied requiring virginity tests, but in May, a senior general who asked not to be identified acknowledged the practice. The general said the tests were performed as a safeguard against the women accusing authorities of sexual assault, and he defended the tests. ""The girls who were detained were not like your daughter or mine,"" the general told CNN at the time. ""These were girls who had camped out in tents with male protesters in Tahrir Square, and we found in the tents Molotov cocktails and (drugs)."" But Ibrahim said her treatment clearly showed the tests were meant to ""degrade the protesters."" ""The military tortured me, labeled me a prostitute and humiliated me by forcing on me a virginity test conducted by a male doctor where my body was fully exposed while military soldiers watched,"" she said. Another protester arrested in the March 9 protest, Salwa Hosseini, offered a similar account, according to an Amnesty International report on the allegations. In addition to Ibrahim, a member of the No to Military Trials to Civilians group, Maha Mamoun,  joined the legal action even though she was not subjected to a test, said Ahmed Ragab, an attorney with the Hisham Mubarak Law Center who handled Ibrahim's case. Ragab said government lawyers initially denied that the tests were administered and the case was repeatedly delayed before Tuesday's ruling.","Ruling involves military prisons and temporary detention, governemnt consultant says .

"Meet P26 -- a shy pangolin who recently was released into a national park in Vietnam after being seized from the illegal pangolin trade. Pangolins are thought to be the most trafficked mammals in the world, which made them the subject of a recent series for CNN's Change the List project. They're traded by the ton. The fine people who are taking care of P26 -- from the Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program --  agreed to let CNN's readers do something kind of cool: We're going to vote on a new name for this little guy, and then follow his journey. I asked readers to submit some name ideas. The top five you suggested were: Pemalu, Bao, Percival, Sandshrew and Lance. UPDATE: Voting closed on Tuesday at 6 p.m. ET. P26 will take on whichever name readers select. Some of the names require a little explanation. Pemalu is Indonesian for ""shy,"" which fits since researchers at the Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program tell me P26 is one of the shyest of all the introverted pangolins they've encountered. Báº£o is Vietnamese for ""protection,"" which is nice because pangolins sure need it. Percival is alliterative and kinda fun in an old-timey way. (Pangolins have been called little dinosaurs, after all; I picture Percival the Pangolin wearing a monocle and a top hat.) Sandshrew is my least favorite of the bunch, but it's a Pokemon character that does bear a striking resemblance. And Lance, according to the commenter who suggested that, is short for ""Lancelot,"" ""because his body looks like a suit of armor and he's valiantly fighting to survive."" So there you go -- five names, five stories. You can read up on P26 on this blog from the Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program. P26 is so terribly shy that when researchers released him he just sat there in a box for hours, unsure of where to go or what to do. He burrowed beneath one tree, then another, with researchers following his moves with a radio-tracking device attached to his tail (you can see it in the image above). At one point, he moved so little that it sounds like the researchers -- or at least some blog readers -- doubted that he was alive. ""For any of you still not convinced he is alive this morning, with my head stuck right into a tree hollow, I saw the element of the transmitter,"" wrote Louise Fletcher, one of the researchers, on March 29. ""I tried to give it a little pull to see if it was attached to a body or not (we couldn't actually see him). However, before I had the chance the element started moving of its own accord and we heard some movement. ""The transmitter is certainly still attached to P26 and P26 is still alive!"" Alive and in need of a better name. But that's where you come in.","Vote below to rename this pangolin, who is currently called P26 .

"(CNN)Rupert Murdoch threw a grenade. J.K. Rowling caught it in midair and lobbed it back. The explosion -- in the battlefield of social media -- injured the truth. Murdoch, the conservative media magnate, never afraid to ruffle liberal feathers, tweeted that Muslims ""must be held responsible"" for ""their growing jihadist cancer."" Rowling, the creator of Harry Potter, deployed her rhetorical mastery. ""I was born Christian,"" she tweeted back. ""If that makes Rupert Murdoch my responsibility, I'll auto-excommunicate.""  At last count, more than 20,000 people had re-tweeted her. The comedian Aziz Ansari shot back, ""Rups can we get a step by step guide? How can my 60 year old parents in NC help destroy terrorist groups? Plz advise."" There are few subjects as sensitive -- as easy to get wrong -- as the role of Islam and the responsibility of the world's Muslims in the terrorist barbarism plaguing much of the world today. Murdoch is wrong. Muslims, all Muslims, are not responsible for what happened. But that's not the end of it.  Rowlings, Ansari and the tens of thousands who favorite their tweets are right in saying this is not the fault of all Muslims, nor is it exclusively up to them, all of them, to take on the battle. But the tweets leave out a fundamental part of the problem. Muslims have a crucial role to play in fighting extremist acts committed in the name of their religion and, indeed, many of them are doing it. From social media to the highest spheres of power, there are Muslims demanding reform, demanding reaffirmation of individual freedoms and rejecting violence. Ansari's parents need not drop everything they're doing and head for the fight against ISIS. But individuals, in this era of high connectivity, can argue for their beliefs. Ansari, for one, with a large following and gift for communicating his views, has the ability to advance the conversation away from both extremes. There are people to persuade on all sides, not just that Murdoch is wrong, but also that the ideology of the terrorists is wrong. A Pew poll of 14,244 people in 14 countries with large Muslim populations revealed a few months ago, significant minorities of Muslims believe suicide bombings are ""justified to defend Islam from its enemies."" In Bangladesh 47% said suicide bombings are acceptable, in Gaza 62% agreed, in Egypt 24% did. Those are alarming numbers, a sign that murderous extremism is indeed a problem, one that Muslims should view with urgency, not least because the vast majority of suicide bombings, of terrorism of all kinds, kills Muslims. Thousands of Muslims, including Europeans, have joined the viciously violent ISIS which, by some accounts, enjoys the support of a rather large minority of French and European Muslims. That is excellent news for Europe's extreme right-wing politicians, who have built their careers on racism and religious prejudice -- most recently against Muslims and immigrants from Muslim countries -- and have found a populist sweet spot in the carnage. After the killings at Charlie Hebdo and the subsequent siege and murder of Jewish shoppers at a Paris Kosher market, the stage is set for anti-immigrant parties to make gains in Europe. And the barbarism ranges well beyond: Hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped in Nigeria by the Islamist terrorist group, Boko Haram, whose name applies the Islamic term ""Haram"" -- what is forbidden -- to Boko, a word used to described a Western education. Even as the media was focused on Paris, Boko Haram slaughtered thousands more in Nigeria, including many children, wiping out entire villages. These attacks should bring together a coalition spanning the political spectrum, including Muslims, Christians and Jews, conservatives and liberals, the overwhelming majorities of whom favor the defense of personal freedoms. And Muslims should stand in the vanguard of that coalition, with their arms thrown across the shoulders of Jews, signifying rejection of the intolerance that has made itself at home among far too many of their coreligionists. There is a war of ideas raging in the Muslim world. The prize is the soul of modern Islam. It's not enough to say this is not my fault. Terrorists say they fight on behalf of Muslims. Muslims cannot be mere bystanders. But there is a well-meaning segment of the population, particularly among the left, that stubbornly tries to deny the religious context of the terrorist attacks and the need for it to be addressed within Muslim communities. By doing this, the left and the center push people to the right -- that is, people who agree with Murdoch's views. This is because many voters know the denial is dishonest or blind. Those who close their eyes to the religiously-inspired motivation of the killers, and of their religion-inspired goals, are just as mistaken. Are all Muslims responsible? Are they guilty? No, of course not. Do they have a responsibility to help fight this growing threat? Yes, absolutely yes. In some respects, it is reminiscent of the role of the German people in the aftermath of World War II. Today's Germans are not guilty of what their parents and grandparents did. But they have a special role in preventing a resurgence of those odious and dangerous views. It's not Islamophobic to acknowledge that most of the terrorism we see today is being perpetrated by people who say they want Sharia, Islamic law, that they want a Muslim caliphate, that they reject modernity in favor of life in the way of the Prophet Mohammed's day. We have seen ISIS -- the self-styled caliphate or ""Islamic State"" -- kidnapping, raping and enslaving women; beheading hostages, Europeans and Americans -- but mostly Muslims. Islamist terrorists, organizations committed to imposing their views of what their religion commands, are killing without mercy in Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Israel, Somalia, Pakistan, India, France, Belgium, Canada, Australia and elsewhere. Only the perpetrators, their supporters and their enablers are guilty. Don't let anyone use the tragedy to score political points or to denigrate Muslims as a whole. But don't deny the truth: There is a dangerous problem within Islam that must be addressed by Muslims with the support of the rest of the world. Both extremes in this discussion have it wrong, and by perpetuating their distortions they harm efforts to protect tolerance from the intolerant; to make the world safe for Muslims and non-Muslims -- for everyone, including those lobbing grenades backs and forth in social media.","Frida Ghitis: Rupert Murdoch tweet: Muslims must be accountable for jihadist 'cancer'

"Korean opera singer Sumi Jo is one of the best-loved sopranos of her generation who has performed at ceremonies for an Olympic Games and a football World Cup. In a career spanning 26 years, she was the first Asian opera singer to achieve worldwide success and has won accolades and fans all over the world, from a Grammy award to being elected a UNESCO Artist for Peace. ""Everyday when I wake up, I thank God that I can sing,"" she says. ""Life is such a precious gift so everyday is beautiful to me."" But the success has not come without sacrifices. At the age of 19, she traveled alone half way round the world from her native South Korea to Italy to kick start her career in the home of opera, and has been traveling ever since. Far from her friends and family, Jo said she was one of very few Asians in Italy at the time. ""I went there just because I wanted to study opera but I didn't realize that it could be that difficult,"" she says. ""I had to face a lot of things I didn't know. I didn't know how to cook, I didn't know any Italian and I had to cook and I had to deal with other people. ""The first year I changed my room seven times."" Jo said a puppy she found in the street became her only companion in Italy. ""In that terrible period no one was there, no parents, no friend, I was completely alone, but she was there and she gave me a lot of joy and she kept me company and she lived 15 years with me."" Also on Leading Women: Your top-flight lawyer? She's a stay-at-home mom . Today she owns three beloved dogs and is involved with an animal rights charity in South Korea. Despite the difficulties, Jo went on to achieve incredible success. She has made more than 50 recordings, including 10 solo albums, one of which won a Grammy award in 1993. She has performed the title role in at least four operas at New York's Metropolitan Opera, and at most of the world's major opera houses. Jo also performed at the Opening Ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and the 2002 Football World Cup in South Korea. She has also taken part in pop projects recently, and featured on the soundtrack for the mini-series ""Mildred Pierce"" starring Kate Winslet and Guy Pierce. Jo says she was destined to be an opera singer before she was even born, as her mother had dreamed of being a singer herself and had been thwarted by political upheaval. ""She was born during the Japanese occupation and then she went through the Korean War,"" Jo says. ""My mother suffered a lot, hunger and misery, but she was unhappy not having cultural stimulation. ""So she always thought if she had a baby girl she wanted to make her an opera singer and here that's why I'm here. My destiny was already decided by her."" Jo began piano and singing lessons early, but says she missed out on a conventional carefree childhood. ""I still think that pushing a child too much could also could be quite cruel and unfair,"" she says. ""For my case probably it worked because, thank god, I had to the talent. I think that children should play more and let them do what they want."" Devotion to her career even meant Jo missing her father's funeral, after he died in 2006 while she was in Paris. ""I just wanted to go to Korea right away,"" she said. ""My mother told me by phone she said, 'You should stay there to sing for your public because for me you are not a simple a daughter for me. I consider you an artist so you should stay there for and sing for you audience.' ""It was such an incredible moment. I can not tell you. I couldn't say any words."" Also on Leading Women: $800 million biotech business started in a garage . Jo sang at a concert the next evening while the funeral was happening in South Korea, and later released the recording as a DVD dedicated to her father. ""I announced to the audience my situation and everybody stood up and applauded,"" she says. ""I wasn't able to assist him at the end, but I have this gift for him so I hope he will forgive me. At the age of 49, Jo is still working to achieve the balance between work and home life that she craves. ""I somehow realized I have been missing something, my family, my home, my country, but it's not so easy because I always wanted to do something new, new music, new theater, new recordings, so it's difficult to have a balance."" She added: ""I wish I could be more happy. Sometimes I see myself sad and lonely, but I think I deserve to be more happy. It means that I need to grow up. I still feel like a beginner even if I had been singing many years.""","Sumi Jo was the first Asian opera singer to achieve worldwide success .

"(CNN) -- Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam has been elected chairman of the Republican Governors Association, replacing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Susana Martinez of New Mexico will serve as vice chairman. The decision was announced over Twitter during the party's three-day annual conference in Boca Raton, Florida. Unlike his predecessor, Haslam is known for his drama-free leadership style, and has been described as soft-spoken and mild-mannered. The Tennessee businessman, sports team owner, and former Knoxville mayor was re-elected to his second term as governor in November. Looking ahead, Haslam will face a much smaller election in 2015 than Christie did this past year. Instead of overseeing 36 governor's races, Haslam will only have to fundraise and campaign for three: in Kentucky, Mississippi and Louisiana. In a statement, Christie praised Haslam as a ""true pioneer."" ""Gov. Haslam is doing what governors are elected to do,"" Christie said. ""He has the results to prove it. His guidance will be a tremendous asset to this organization in the coming year."" Haslam's Democratic counterpart will be elected next month at the Democratic Governors Association annual meeting in Los Angeles.","Haslam replaces New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie .

"French gunman Mohammed Merah, the self-styled al Qaeda jihadist accused of killing seven people, died in a hail of bullets Thursday as police moved in to end a day-long siege. He was shot in the head as he jumped out of a window with a gun in his hand, authorities say, ending a deadly episode that has shaken the nation. As a picture emerged of a man who was known to the police and had apparently sought out Islamist jihadists in Pakistan and Afghanistan, many have questioned why it took so long to track him down. The 23-year-old first struck March 11, killing a soldier in Toulouse. Another shooting in Montauban four days later left two soldiers dead, and a third attack on a Jewish school in Toulouse Monday killed four people, three of them children. Announcing Merah's death, Interior Minister Claude Gueant said a special forces expert had told him they had never seen a suspect resist with such ferocity. Merah had shown what a dangerous man he was by first telling police he would negotiate and then declaring he would resist arrest with lethal force, Gueant said. And when police finally entered his apartment, he burst out of a bathroom with guns blazing and continued shooting to the end, Gueant said. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said that every effort had been made to take Merah alive, but in the end, no more lives could be put at risk to achieve that. Merah still had guns, ammunition and the ingredients to make petrol bombs in his apartment when it was raided, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said, and was wearing a bulletproof vest. CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said that from an al Qaeda perspective, Merah went down in a blaze of glory, still firing at special forces as he died. Police wait, negotiate with suspect . He had told police commandos late Wednesday that he wanted ""to die as a mujahedeen,"" Molins said. But Molins, who is France's counterterrorism chief, rejected the suggestion that intelligence forces had failed by not picking up the serious threat posed by Merah sooner. Merah, a French national of Algerian origin, had not followed a traditional route to radicalization or joined known Islamist networks, Molins said, actions which would have triggered closer scrutiny. Nonetheless, Merah had been under surveillance by French intelligence for a couple of years, having ""already committed certain infractions, some with violence,"" Gueant told CNN affiliate BFM-TV. Merah spent considerable time in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the minister added. His attendance at an al Qaeda training camp there led to him being placed on the U.S. no-fly list, a U.S. intelligence official, who was not authorized to speak to the media, told CNN. On Wednesday, the interior minister told how Merah, under siege, had boasted of his actions to police through the closed door of his apartment in the southwestern city of Toulouse. ""He claims to be a jihadist and says he belongs to al Qaeda,"" Gueant said. ""He wanted to avenge the Palestinian children and take revenge on the French army because of its foreign interventions."" Molins said then that the suspect told the officers surrounding his apartment that he had acted alone -- and that he had intended to carry out more attacks on police and a soldier Wednesday. Merah's only regret was that he was not able to kill more people, the prosecutor said, and he boasted of having brought France ""to its knees."" Molins said Merah had initially indicated that he was not intending a suicide mission and wanted to live. But as the siege wore on, the chances of the suspect emerging alive receded. Now all attention is likely to be focused on what caused him to strike -- and whether Merah did, as he said, act alone. Investigators looking at a possible role played by his older brother, Abdelkader Merah, want more time to question him, Molins said, and are following up other leads. His mother is also being questioned. Police tracked Merah down via his mother's computer IP address, which was apparently used to respond to an ad posted by the first shooting victim, officials said. Gueant initially told reporters it was the IP address of Merah's brother that led investigators to him. But little is known about what triggered Merah's radicalization. In one clue, Molins said Merah had told police he started reading the Quran while in prison, after presumably being exposed to more radical ideologies there. Lawyer Christian Etelin, who represented Merah in connection with previous minor offenses, said his client went to Afghanistan two years ago. He had become suddenly radicalized, Etelin told BFM-TV, and wanted to become more involved politically. Etelin last saw Merah, whom he described as having a ""complex"" personality, on February 24, when he appeared in court accused of driving without a license and causing an accident with injuries. Merah was sentenced to a month in prison and was to appear before the judge again in early April to determine where he would serve that sentence, the attorney said. Killings focus fears on 'solo' acts of terror . But a series of clues, some relating to a scooter used in the attacks, instead led investigators late Tuesday night to the apartment in Toulouse where Merah holed up under siege, armed and dangerous. The shootings had already revealed a ruthless and determined killer. All seven victims were shot in the head, most at point-blank range, and authorities said they were carefully targeted because of their religious and ethnic ties. The gunman's first victims were three soldiers of North African origin who had recently returned from Afghanistan, who were shot dead in two incidents. Days later, the killer struck again, killing a rabbi and three children at the Jewish school Monday. More details of how Merah planned and executed the attacks are likely to emerge in the coming days. Videos he took of the attacks, seen by police, suggests a cold-blooded brutality. ""Allahu Akbar,"" (God is great) he says as he guns down the two soldiers in Montauban. Merah said he had posted the video online, but police do not yet know where, Molins said. Merah claimed to have trained with al Qaeda in Pakistan's Waziristan region, bordering Afghanistan, Molins said. He was sent back from Afghanistan to France after being picked up at a traffic stop by Afghan police who reported his presence to international forces, the prosecutor said. The French defense ministry said Merah had twice tried to join the country's armed forces. The first time, in the northern city of Lille, he was turned down because of his prior convictions. The second time, in July 2010, he attempted to sign up for the Foreign Legion in Toulouse, but left during the first round of testing, the ministry said. Although his neighbors describe him as having been a quiet man, at home Merah had watched violent jihadist videos online, including footage of decapitations, Molins said. He was sentenced 15 times by a Toulouse juvenile court when he was a minor, the prosecutor added. Police have questioned other family members in Toulouse, including his mother, Zoulika Aziri, Molins said. Mohammed Merah was born in Toulouse in October 1988, according to Elisabeth Allanic, magistrate at the prosecutor's office in Paris, and at one time he worked in a garage in a Toulouse suburb. He grew up in a northern suburb of city called Les Izards, which lawyer Etelin described as an area with some drug-related activity. Etelin told BFM-TV he had represented Merah since 2004 or 2005, when his client was a minor, mostly over accusations of theft. He said Merah had been ""polite and courteous"" and had shown no signs then of a tendency toward radicalization. That might have changed after his trips to Pakistan and Afghanistan, but Etelin said he didn't notice a big difference. ""I knew he was politically active but he never spoke to me about this. He didn't want to talk about this,"" Etelin said. ""He was very discreet on this. But I never had the impression that he was an individual radically different from the one I knew in the beginning. I always knew him as being someone very flexible in his behavior, courteous, polite, soft and certainly not rigid to the point of being led by a certain fanaticism."" Etelin said that before the alleged murders, he had mainly been in contact with Merah's older sister, who, along with their mother, had been ""exasperated"" with Merah's minor crimes. ""It was not possible to see him being serious,"" the sister had said, according to Etelin.","Merah's activities led to his inclusion on a U.S. no-fly list, an intelligence official says .

"Former President Bill Clinton told CNN he agrees with President Barack Obama's decision to authorize airstrikes against the terrorist group ISIS and arm Syrian rebels working to defeat them. During a panel hosted by CNN's Erin Burnett at the Clinton Global Initiative on Wednesday, the former president unequivocally said, ""I support what they (the Obama administration) are doing."" ""I personally believe the way they have thought this through and planned it and limited our involvement, avoids ISIS achieving their objective of suckering us into their fight,"" Clinton said of the airstrikes. ""We should give support for people who are fighting for their lives."" On arming Syrian rebels, the former president said the administration has ""reached the judgment that it is... worth the gamble, I think, to try to make it work."" Join the conversation with Bing Pulse . Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have not always been as supportive of the Obama administration's policy regarding Syria. As America's top diplomat, Hillary Clinton urged the president to arm Syrian rebels and made clear that she disagreed with Obama's decision not to arm them in her much-talked-about memoir. Earlier this week, Bill Clinton echoed his wife. ""I agree with her, and I would have taken the chance,"" the former president told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Sunday. But on Wednesday, the former president was supportive of Obama's new position on Syria. ""Any time you do anything, it might not work. We don't have 100 percent control,"" Clinton said. ""You just make a judgment over whether it is more likely than not to work. The President has made that judgment to arm the Syrians who want an inclusive Syria."" Hillary Clinton, too, was supportive of Obama's decision Wednesday. ""The situation now is demanding a response and we are seeing a very robust response,"" Hillary Clinton said during a panel with CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. ""It is something that I think the president is right to bring the world attention to and say."" The United States and a coalition of member countries conducted their second day of airstrikes in Syria and Iraq overnight on Tuesday. While the strikes, which were authorized by Obama last week, are targeting ISIS members in both countries, they are not limited to the terrorist group that has risen to prominence in the last year.

"Unsecured footage from thousands of webcams around the world -- including in the United States and western Europe -- has been accessed and streamed by a website thought to be based in the Russian Federation, British officials say. The website's operator claims to be republishing the feeds -- from sources including CCTV and baby monitors -- to highlight security weaknesses. So what can consumers do to find out if their privacy has been violated and to prevent it from happening again? CNN spoke to Andrew Paterson, senior technology officer at Britain's independent authority on information rights -- the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) -- which issued a warning about the web cams Thursday and Jules Polonetsky, executive director of the Future of Privacy Forum think tank. How can you tell if your webcam feed has been compromised? Paterson suggests the first step for concerned consumers should be to check the security settings on their web camera and ensure that their password is not set to default. ""It's a website that's republished the feeds from many thousands of unsecured web cams and CCTV cameras. I believe you can view more or less live footage and it looks like one person has automatically scanned the internet for unsecured cameras and then aggregated this information in one site,"" Paterson says. ""If you're particularly interested you could try to find your country, you could try to find the region or city that camera is in."" The website guesses location based on IP addresses and has a list of countries from where it is publishing feeds, ranking them by number of unsecured cameras discovered. At the time of writing, the U.S. tops the list -- with 4,591 feeds, followed by France, the Netherlands, Japan, Italy and the United Kingdom. What devices are affected? CCTV cameras and baby monitors are among the devices that feeds have been taken from. But many others could be affected. ""In theory, if you have a web camera and it is interface accessible over the internet, it could be at risk,"" Paterson says. Paterson says in the case of the Russian website it appears that the operator has concentrated on only a few makes. The worry is that others may also have accessed such feeds, he says: ""It appears that the person responsible is trying to raise awareness but it's possible other people are doing other things."" Polonetsky says it's valuable to teach the lesson that web cameras need to be secured but says there have to be better ways than publishing people's feeds online. He says similar problems have existed for years. ""Almost scarier is that there are thousands of other similarly unprotected devices on the web. We continually learn about some essential device that is web accessible,"" he says. ""There have been some very public examples of smart home equipment that could be accessed remotely,"" he says -- including devices to raise blinds or turn on lights remotely. ""If you can remotely access something, that means others can remotely access it as well and you need to lock it down -- or you're at risk."" So what can I do to protect my privacy? Again, Paterson stresses that having a strong password is critical. ""The one piece of advice I can give is that if you have a camera you should go and check if it's secured with a password and must double check it's not the default password,"" he says. ""Secondly, work out whether you actually need to view your webcam over the internet or not. If you don't then you might as well turn that feature off."" While the ICO doesn't know the Russian website owner's intentions, Paterson says that as far as it can tell the feeds have not been archived -- though they don't know for certain. ""It looks like if you change the default password and set a strong one it will no longer show up on website -- but the owner [on the Russian site] could do anything he or she wants,"" he says. But the same flaw that has allowed this website to access personal feeds, could also have let other online users view your feed -- and they may not be broadcasting the fact. ""If you're able to log in remotely, then others are able to log in remotely. Either ensure that access is disabled or ensure you have a secure password,"" Polonetsky says. Could I seek redress if my camera feed has been accessed? Polonetsky suggests that delivering a product with a security weakness is ""like selling houses without  a front door."" ""Actually, it's worse,"" he says. ""Here you're selling things to people who don't even know there's not a back door. It's completely irresponsible -- it's like selling a car without a key piece of safety equipment. These things are not safe to be on the internet."" Polonetsky says it is possible that sellers of devices without basic data protection would be considered unfair to consumers under the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's standards. ""It could be considered unfair to sell a product that puts personal data at great risk. It will be interesting to see if any the sellers face action."" In the UK, Paterson says accessing a computer without authorization could well breach the Computer Misuse Act. ""If you have strong evidence that somebody has compromised your camera you may be able to take it to law enforcement,"" he says. The ICO itself regulates the Data Protection Act. ""If the feed from your camera can identify individuals that would be personal data and if someone's processing that in an unfair or unlawful manner then it could breach the act,"" he says. As the website appears to be Russian-based, however, any potential legal action would require action from the authorities there. The ICO is currently trying to enlist their help to get the website taken down.","UK Information Commissioner's Office says a website is publishing private webcam feeds .
It says the footage has been taken from devices ranging from CCTV to baby monitors .
The ICO says consumers should always change default passwords on cameras .

"(CNN)U2 lead singer Bono is not having a good month. Days after a rear hatch flew off his aircraft midair, a bicycle accident in New York landed him in an operating room this week. It turns out his injuries were not minor. The singer had a ""high-energy bicycle accident"" when he tried to avoid another rider Sunday at Central Park, according to New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, where he was treated. The hospital released  details on his injuries for the first time Wednesday night. Bono underwent hours of multiple surgeries after the accident, it said. He broke his arm in six spots, fractured his eye socket and also his shoulder blade -- the latter in three places, according to Dr. Dean Lorich,  a trauma surgeon at the hospital. Doctors operated on him for five hours Sunday, which included repairing his bone with three metal plates and 18 screws,  Lorich said in a statement. A day later, he had surgery on his left hand to repair a fracture. ""He will require intensive and progressive therapy. However, a full recovery is expected,"" the doctor said. Bono's mishaps this month could have been much worse. The rear hatch of his aircraft dropped off midflight on his way from Dublin to Berlin on November 13. The ground crew discovered the hatch was missing shortly after the plane landed. Two suitcases flew out, but all six people aboard were fine.","The singer had a ""high-energy bicycle accident"" at Central Park on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- In September 1985 a devastating earthquake measuring 8.1 on the Richter Scale smashed into Mexico City killing 10,000 people and leaving parts of the city in ruins. Since then, the populous Latin American nation of 122 million has invested in one of the most advanced seismic warning systems anywhere in the world. The SASMEX facility came online in 1991 and reacts to data gathered by sensors placed near major fault lines along Mexico's Pacific coast. Receivers dotted around five major cities, including Mexico City and Acapulco, will sound the alarm if they detect an earthquake. It's a system that can buy vital seconds for residents to brace themselves before the tremors begin. But not everyone has access to a SASMEX receiver -- there are 100,000 in operation but at a cost of roughly $330 apiece, they are a luxury the majority of Mexicans can't afford. Most receivers are stationed in the likes of public buildings, hospitals, schools and subway stations. With roughly 21 million people living both formally and informally in and around Mexico City alone, that means many will not be aware the alarm is sounding until the ground begins shaking. $50 alarm . According to local tech entrepreneur, Andres Meira, such vital services should be far more widely available. Meira is no passive observer in this debate. He moved to Mexico City after working in Haiti and witnessing the devastation caused by the 7.0 magnitude earthquake that struck the Caribbean island in 2010 killing more than 230,000 people. It's an experience that had a profound and lasting effect on him. ""Until you live in one of these places you don't really understand the primitive fear of earthquakes,"" he said. ""There are times when you can't sleep and sometimes you wake up in the middle of the night and make sure things aren't moving."" Now, after combining with local engineers and tech investors based in Silicon Valley, Meira believes he may have a solution that will bring the SASMEX signal to the masses. It's called the Grillo (the Spanish word for cricket) early warning system. The compact device -- a cube about the size of an alarm clock -- taps into the special frequencies that SASMEX operates on and relays that information to its users. When seismic activity is detected, the Grillo sounds a loud, flashing alarm. At a cost of just $50, it also undercuts the price of the receivers used primarily in public buildings by around 85%. ""This is the most affordable and the most direct way for the Mexican public to connect to the early warning system,"" Meira says of the product, which also became Mexico's most successful ever Kickstarter campaign. Mexico City's geographic location and geological makeup put it at particular risk from seismic activity. There have been a handful of relatively small quakes in 2014 already. Meira also hopes versions of the Grillo system could be introduced elsewhere in the world where earthquakes are a real risk -- like in Nepal, India, the West Coast of the U.S. and along much of the Pacific Coast of South America. Missing education? But others point to the difficulty of introducing a mass warning system without first educating citizens on what to do when receiving a direct alert. Speaking to McClatchyDC.com earlier this year, Arturo Iglesias Mendoza, director of the Institute of Geophysics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, pondered what would happen if 5,000 of 60,000 people in a football stadium received an alert of an imminent earthquake? ""People should know that the safest thing to do is to stay in the stadium,"" he said. On top of that, the $50 price is still a considerable investment for many residents of a country where the average wage remains under $5 a day. Then there is the fact that only a handful of early warning systems like SASMEX exist anywhere in the world. This means that Grillo will unlikely have government sourced data and advanced sensor system set up near major fault lines to tap into in many other locations. Meira and his colleagues have anticipated such difficulties. He speaks of the next stage of the Grillo project which will see hundreds of specially developed sensors placed all over Mexico, feeding into an algorithm that will provide early-warning alerts to apps and smartphones. Warning app . Known as Grillo Active, the tiny orange devices contain a sensitive movement detector, microprocessor and a WiFi module to transmit a signal. Grillo are currently in talks with a major convenience store chain to locate the devices at between 500 and 1,000 of their stores around Mexico. Such a wide spread will ensure more reliable and faster alerts. ""The real test of a good infrastructure is the density of sensors,"" Meira said. ""This is our plan in Mexico."" Given that the devices can be produced cheaply and located anywhere with an internet connection, the potential for Grillo to be used in a variety of vulnerable areas around the world is very real. Japan remains the only nation in the world where the entire country is hooked up to an early warning facility. And that system, which consists of 1,000 GPS sensors. For now, however, this fledgling group's focus remains on Mexico. The first small batch of Grillo boxes produced have been sold, although they haven't yet seen any action in the field. Mexico's last earthquake was recorded about six months ago, when the device was still in the prototype phase. Meira hopes that the acid test doesn't come too soon, but he expects a solid performance from his invention when it does. ""The science is all there,"" he said. ""We have tested it out in two earthquakes and they worked just fine. One was a seven pointer (on the Richter scale) and it worked perfectly."" Now, they await the next earthquake.","Grillo is a device that aims to bring a low-cost earthquake warning system to the masses in Mexico .

"(CNN)It was January 2014 and I was sitting on the beach in Malibu looking out at the seemingly endless Pacific Ocean, ebbing and flowing. I had just begun a personal project of challenging my lifelong assumption that God exists. You see, I had been a Seventh-day Adventist pastor for 19 years. I resigned from my pastoral position the year before, but now I stepped away from my faith altogether. It was a gut-wrenching decision but I couldn't see any other way to find peace and clarity. I encountered major theological differences with my denomination and evangelical Christianity in general, including the way it marginalizes women and LGBT people. I questioned the problem of evils and God's general silence and inactivity. I sought out more liberal theologies and found them to be the slow death of God. Now I had to face the very real possibility that God does not exist. Would I discover that God was present and involved, or would I discover that the whole web of theological claims I had embraced and helped develop were false? I was feeling small against the beautiful and terrifyingly indifferent sea before me. Then I started to feel grateful. ""What are the chances that I would be sitting on this beach right now, looking at this remarkable scene of beauty?"" I thought. I was struck again by how unlikely my existence is. One question I've been repeatedly asked is how my life has any meaning without God. While I had heard dozens of Christian apologists claim that meaning cannot be found without God, I had a curious experience. My appreciation for life and its potential increased when I stepped away from my faith. Atheists are often accused of being nihilists or absurdists. Absurdism is a school of thought arguing that humanity's effort to find inherent meaning in life is futile. Nihilism goes further and in doing so becomes a mood or a disposition as well as a philosophical frame of mind. Nihilism says that nothing matters at all. ""If there is no God, then man and the universe are doomed. Like prisoners condemned to death, we await our unavoidable execution. There is no God, and there is no immortality. And what is the consequence of this? It means that life itself is absurd. It means that the life we have is without ultimate significance, value, or purpose,"" writes William Lane Craig, a Christian apologist. But my experience is that acknowledging the absence of God has helped me refocus on the wonderful and unlikely life I do have. This realization has increased my appreciation for beauty and given me a sense of immediacy about my life. As I come to terms with the fact that this life is the only one I get, I am more motivated than ever to make it count. I want to experience as much happiness and pleasure as I can while helping others to attain their happiness. I construct meaning in my life from many sources, including love, family, friendships, service, learning and so on. Popular Christian theology, on the other hand, renders this life less meaningful by anchoring all notions of value and purpose to a paradise somewhere in the future, in a place other than where we are right now. Ironically, my Christian upbringing taught me that ultimately this life doesn't matter, which tends to make believers apathetic about suffering and think that things will only get worse before God suddenly solves everything on the last day. Behold, atheists' new Ten Commandments . It struck me this year that nihilism is a disease born of theism. Some people have been taught to expect meaning outside of this world beyond our earthly experiences. When they come upon the many absurdities of life and see that it's ""not as advertised,"" an existential despair can take hold. The problem is not solved by inventing a God in which to place all our hopes, but rather, to face life honestly and create beauty from the absurd. Without dependency on a cosmic savior who is coming to rescue us, we are free to recognize that we are the ones we're waiting for. If we don't make the world a fair and habitable place, no one else is going to do it for us. Our lives matter because our choices affect others and our children's future. Life does not need a divine source in order to be meaningful. Anyone who has seen a breathtaking sunset or fallen in love with another human being knows that we make meaning from the experiences of our lives; we construct it the way we construct any social narrative. Free from false expectations we are free to create purpose, share love, and enjoy the endless beauty of our world. We are the fortunate ones. There is no need for fear to have the last word.","Ryan Bell, former pastor turned atheist, says we don't need a divinity to find meaning .
Bell: The absence of God has made him appreciate life and its potential even more ."
"When the government shut down last year, Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Alabama, walked up to a fellow conservative a few feet from the House Floor, and high fived him. Now, Republicans are so shutdown averse, even Brooks tells CNN they should do everything in their power to fight President Barack Obama's immigration executive action. Everything except shutting down the government. Brooks' change speaks volumes about Republican thinking at a time when the party is weighing a response to Obama's order amid pressure from some influential outside conservative forces are pushing Republicans to go once again down the shutdown route. ""There is no reason to shut down the government over this. It would be bad for the government, bad for the country and playing into his hands in a way,"" said Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio. RELATED: The legal battle over Obama's immigration plan . ""Nobody wants to shut the government down. I don't know anybody on either side of the aisle with rational thoughts would want to shut the government down. So we start with that premise,"" echoed Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama. ""I would try anything except a shutdown of the government,"" added Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona. The lawmakers spoke in separate hallway interviews. With a shutdown off the table -- the question is how can Republicans respond? The answer, according to many Republican congressional sources, is that they don't have a lot of viable avenues for beating back the president's executive order, which is expected to allow up to 5 million illegal immigrants to stay legally. There may not be great options, but there are at least some choices. Aim for the budget . The first is to use Congress' greatest weapon -- the power of the purse -- without shutting down the government. A leading idea is to fund the majority of the government for a year, as planned, but carve out funding for immigration-related agencies and only provide money for those for a short time. One Republican senator, who asked not to be identified in order to speak freely about the strategy, told CNN that such a move would ""give us time to come up with a proposal."" ""He won't veto either of those, I don't think,"" the GOP senator said, speaking of the President. There are pitfalls in this idea -- not the least of which is getting the bill passed in what is still a Democratic-controlled Senate. But GOP sources admit a broader problem that Republicans have with using the power of the purse to stop the president from enacting his executive action is that Congress doesn't actually fund the immigration agency responsible for enforcement. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the primary agency responsible for green cards and work permits, is self-funded -- paid for with customs fees. That's why other Republican lawmakers admit they would have to put policy riders negating the president's actions on appropriations bills, which would lead back to the short term problem of a government shutdown, since the president is unlikely to sign a bill that rolls back his own executive order. Another option under discussion is to pass a spending bill in December, but vote separately early next year on a bill that would rescind any funds specifically for those federal agencies that carry out the immigration executive order. Several Republicans say they could attach this kind of a bill to cancel the money to a one authorizing another program the president supports, which would put him in a tough position to veto it. Sue the president . Republican lawmakers do believe they will have a good case to take to the courts to fight to the president's actions. Several House Republicans said a lawsuit should be filed immediately to attempt to halt -- at least temporarily -- the president's plans, but they admit that legal challenge will drag out and should be pursued on a separate track than the debate over government funding. Some say they that when the new GOP-controlled Congress takes over they will push resolutions formally rejecting and presidential executive order and admonishing him for it. The idea is that showing Congress disapproves will help give lawmakers legal standing in court. Block the president's nominees . Still another idea floated by some GOP members is to block some of the president's nominations in the Senate in response to executive order.  It's unlikely Republicans would refuse to vote on Loretta Lynch, the president's pick to replace Eric Holder as Attorney General, but they could deny votes on other key positions the president want to fill. CORRECTION: This post has been updated to correct which state Rep. Mo Brooks is from.","Some Republicans are pushing to avoid a government shutdown this year .

Alternatives to a shutdown include hitting the budget, suing and blocking nominees ."
"A top liberal advocacy group is lambasting ABC, NBC and CBS for deciding to not air President Barack Obama's primetime address on immigration Thursday despite running a 2006 primetime address by President George W. Bush on the same issue. MoveOn.org blasted the networks' phone numbers and Twitter handles Thursday in an email to supporters, urging them to lobby for a live broadcast. Obama is expected to announce sweeping executive actions to reform the immigration system and shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation. ""[People] should make the choice whether they want to tune in or not and not have it preempted by network executives,"" said Justin Krebs, one of the group's campaigners who organized Thursday's push. And while Obama's speech will announce policies that will affect millions, Krebs said Bush's speech was ""much less sweeping."" Bush laid out his vision for immigration reform in a May 2006 Oval Office address that the three networks carried live in primetime. He called for mobilizing 6,000 National Guard troops to the southern border and offered a series of proposals that he urged Congress to put into legislation. ""While President Bush's discussion was important, it was ultimately a pitch,"" Krebs said. ""This is actually something that's really directly affecting millions of people."" Krebs added that he ""absolutely"" believes MoveOn.org's efforts to mobilize supporters could prompt network executives to change their minds on airing Obama's speech. A CBS News spokesman declined to comment, citing a policy not to discuss editorial decisions. ABC and NBC did not respond to requests for comment. READ: What to watch for in speech . Univision and Telemundo, the two Spanish-language networks, announced they will air the President's address live. Administration officials informally indicated to the networks that they would like to get prime airtime for Obama's roughly 10-minute address. The White House did not make a formal request after the networks appeared unwilling to air the President's speech live. While the Bush speech aired on a Monday night in May 2006, Obama's speech comes at 8 p.m. on a Thursday night -- one of the most-watch TV nights of the week. CBS will be airing the Big Bang Theory, ABC will be airing the Grey's Anatomy's mid-season finale and NBC will air The Biggest Loser during Obama's 8 p.m. speech from the East Room of the White House.

"Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, may be frustrated with the President's anticipated executive action on immigration, but he's not looking to shutdown the government again to stop him. ""There is no Republican -- not one -- who wants a government shutdown,"" Cruz said on Fox Wednesday. ""The only person on this planet who wants a shutdown is President Obama."" Cruz, who voted in favor of shutting down the government last year over Obamacare, made the expected argument that the President would be violating the powers set by the Constitution by forcing executive action. But the former Harvard Law Review editor took the argument a step further Wednesday, saying that if the President acted, he would be forcing voters to take a plunge. ""I'm sorry to say, the President is behaving in an unprecedented way,"" Cruz said. ""There is not in recent times any parallel for a President repudiated by the voters standing up and essentially telling the voters, 'Go jump in a lake'. He's going to force his powers."" Earlier Wednesday, the first-term senator penned a Politico op-ed titled ""Obama Is Not A Monarch,"" where he slammed the President for threatening executive action. Once seen as an obstructionist -- for his 2013 government shutdown crusade -- the potential 2016 contender is changing his strategy this time around for defying the President. Wednesday evening, Cruz laid out a three-step plan for how the GOP should reign in a ""despotic executive."" In the plan, Cruz told Fox News that incoming Senate Majority Leader-elect Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, should threaten to block any nominations by the President, with the exception of those for vital national security positions. He also said Congress should use the power of the purse to pass appropriation legislation that limits the power of both the Congress and the President to spend money on the President's executive action, once all other necessary government agencies and functions are funded. While Cruz says legislative action is the best way to move forward to combat the President's initiative, a few of his GOP colleagues -- and potential 2016 rivals -- said they felt a lawsuit would be more appropriate. Earlier Wednesday, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said there is a ""very real possibility"" Texas will sue Obama over his executive action. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker agreed, saying he would also go to the courts because he thinks ""there's a pretty compelling argument."" The President is expected to announce his executive action plan Thursday in a prime time address. Sources familiar with the plan tell CNN that it includes deferring deportation for the parents of U.S. citizens, a move that would affect up to 3.5 million people.","Ted Cruz: ""Only person...who wants a shutdown is President Obama""

"French authorities backed off a claim that a 22-year-old man was connected to beheadings in a recent ISIS video, a day after publicly identifying him. A spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor's office on Thursday distanced the agency from a news release put forth by her office that identified Mickael Dos Santos as the second French national believed to be an ISIS terrorist. ""We stated yesterday on precise and concurring clues about his identity. We never talked about formal identity. The investigation is still ongoing,"" spokeswoman AgnÃ¨s Thibault-Lecuivre told CNN's Laura Akhoun. She declined further comment. Dos Santos, according to the prosecutor's office, remains wanted on a October 2013 warrant as part of an investigation into French citizens who had gone to Syria to fight with ISIS. Why are so many young French turning to jihad? The announcement leaves just Maxime Hauchard, who authorities said Monday was in the video, released over the weekend, that depicts in graphic detail the beheadings of men whom ISIS militants claim were Syrian government pilots. It also shows the aftermath of another beheading in which the victim in not clearly recognizable, but that the U.S. government says was American aid worker Peter Kassig. Public Prosecutor Francois Molins described Hauchard -- who went to Syria in 2013 and visited Mauritania the previous year -- as a ""self-radicalized"" jihadist who traveled to the region under the guise of a humanitarian mission. He was known to French security services as far back as 2011, the prosecutor said. More barbaric ISIS videos expected after Kassig's death, analyst says . ISIS foreign fighters prompt concern . The ranks of ISIS -- the extremist group calling itself the Islamic State that's taken over vast swaths of Syria and Iraq -- have swelled with volunteers coming from outside the region, including from the West. How foreign fighters are bolstering ISIS . Intelligence estimates indicate that more than 100 of the foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria have come from the United States. Hundreds more arrived from Europe, including more than 900 French citizens that country's government believes are involved in the jihad there. This influx has spurred concerns that some of these fighters could bring the fight back home, perhaps with attacks inside Western nations. Those worries have been heightened by the group's brutal tactics against foe and civilians alike, such as raping, enslaving and selling Iraqi women belonging to the Yazidi religious minority.  Last week, a United Nations panel stated what many consider obvious:  ISIS has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria. Yazidi women 'treated like cattle' The West is fighting back, with many countries -- including France -- allying with Iraq to conduct airstrikes targeting ISIS in that country. The United States has also led airstrikes going after the group in Syria.

"Former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb became the first person from either major party to officially launch a presidential exploratory committee to consider running for president in 2016. Webb announced the exploratory committee Wednesday in a 14-minute online video in which he touts his military background and explains his motivations for considering a White House bid. Webb, a Democrat, would seek the Democratic nomination for President, likely facing off against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is widely expected to announce her candidacy in the coming months. ""We desperately need to fix our country and to reinforce the values that have sustained us for more than two centuries, many of which have fallen by the wayside in the nasty debates of the last several years,"" Webb explains in the video. Webb, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in Vietnam, served one term as a Democratic senator from Virginia, but also served in Republican President Ronald Reagan's administration as assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs before becoming Secretary of the Navy. Webb stresses in his announcement that he is ""not a career politician"" though he has ""proudly spent several periods in government."" Webb spends much of the video discussing his and his family's military background. His father served 26 years in the Air Force and he, his brother and his son all joined the Marine Corps. ""I fought on one of the Vietnam War's harshest battlefields,"" Webb says in the video. Webb also taps into the public's frustration with ""divisive, paralyzed nature of our government"" and hits on popular Democratic themes like poverty and income inequality, signaling that the Democratic Party needs to head in a new direction to help the poor. ""The Democratic Party used to be the place where people like these could come not for a handout but for an honest handshake, good full-time jobs, quality education, health care they can afford, and the vital, overriding belief that we're all in this together and the system is not rigged,"" Webb says. ""We can get there again."" Launching an exploratory committee is the first step candidates take before formally announcing their candidacy for president and allows them to begin raising funds for an eventual campaign. Webb also seems mindful that he would be an underdog heading into Democratic primaries -- especially if Clinton decides to run -- but notes that he won his Senate seat in Virginia despite having ""no money and no staff"" when he announced his candidacy and being ""more than 30 points behind in the polls.""","Webb announced he is forming an exploratory committee in a 14-minute video .

"A guru in India's northern Haryana state is in jail awaiting trial after 10 days of clashes between his followers and police seeking his arrest. The spiritual leader, Rampal Maharaj, was arrested Wednesday at his ashram without further resistance from his followers, said M.L. Kaushik, the regional administrative commissioner. Police said 459 people have been arrested. Also on Wednesday, Rampal's followers turned over the bodies of five women and a child who authorities believe died of illness, Haryana state Police Chief S.N. Vashisht said. Tensions started more than a week ago when the followers didn't let officers arrest Rampal, the commissioner said. The situation began to escalate, culminating in full-blown clashes. The initial order to arrest Maharaj came after he repeatedly failed to appear in court in connection with a 2006 murder case, Kaushik said. After his arrest, the guru also was charged with sedition and waging war against the state, as well as attempted murder and rioting, Haryana state Police Chief S.N. Vashisht told CNN. The guru was jailed after making a court appearance Thursday in the city of Chandigarh, and a hearing was set for November 28, Vashisht said. ""I am innocent. All allegations against me are false,"" Rampal told reporters as he was escorted out of court. Several security personnel were injured in the clashes with the guru's followers, who fired shots and pelted police with stones at the 2Â½-acre religious complex, police said. Police had surrounded the ashram and ordered its evacuation, cutting off the water and electricity, and warned they wouldn't leave until they had arrested Rampal. Police attempted to storm the compound on Tuesday attempting to take Rampal into custody. Television footage showed hundreds of police in riot gear aiming water cannons and tear gas at stone-throwing crowds. As many as 85 of Rampal's followers were hurt, authorities said. Thousands of the supporters left the ashram late Tuesday and into Wednesday, police said. Early Wednesday afternoon, they estimated about 5,000 people remained inside, and the situation was reported to be calmer. Ashram authorities on Wednesday handed over to authorities the bodies of five women and a child who had died recently. Police said the bodies bore no visible signs of injury. ""We believe they were sick and died because of lack of medical attention on time,"" Kaushik said. Autopsies will be performed at a nearby hospital to determine the cause of death. Rampal, 63, is a worshiper of Kabir, a 15th-century Indian mystic, according to his website.","459 are arrested after violence at the ashram of Rampal Maharaj, police say .

"(CNN) -- For more than 100 days, the St. Louis area has experienced an unprecedented season of unrest. On August 9, Officer Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown, an unarmed teen. The next day, the community gathered for prayer in the parking lot of the Ferguson Police Department. People continued to gather as the prayer service ended. I hung around and listened to story after story of police abuse in Ferguson and throughout the St. Louis area. I have no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the stories as my own black children have had similar encounters and stories of their own. Meanwhile, about a mile away on West Florissant Avenue, more people gathered to express grief. Existing frustrations with the business community on West Florissant were amplified by Brown's death. Passions exploded when the grievers were met with an aggressive police presence including a barking attack dog and drawn rifles. In utter despair and bewilderment, one person threw a rock through a window. As others ran from the police, anger and fear collided, resulting in a fair amount of destruction -- including the burning down of the QuikTrip. There hasn't been a day like that since. A tale of two streets in Ferguson . Residents from all over St. Louis who gathered day after day on West Florissant encountered police being transported in armored trucks, standing offensively in riot gear, some officers with rifles and others with batons, none with a name tag. We were tear-gassed and shot with rubber bullets and wooden pellets. A justifiably angry community was met with a violent assault from militarized police. This community needed to process grief, express anger, question authorities, and gather information. We didn't get that. My friend J. Harris said, ""When you treat a generation of people like they have nothing to offer, they will start fighting like they have nothing to lose."" In the months since Brown's death, this community has formed an unbreakable bond. Many times, the community has come together for dinner during protest demonstrations. Women have become surrogate moms. Men have risen as protectors of the community. Lifelong friendships have been formed. The white and Latino community has also entered the struggle. Many white allies have told stories of feeling powerless in righting injustices they have witnessed in their communities and schools and are now empowered by a collective action. Latinos have had similar experiences with police brutality and excessive force, and we stand united. There is within St. Louis a groundswell of residents who are fed up with unchecked power and abuse of trust and authority primarily as it pertains to law enforcement throughout this region. Missouri, it is said, is the heart of America. America's heart is broken. Many talk about a need for reconciliation. Personally, I think reconciliation is the wrong goal as it implies that an equitable relationship existed at some point. There is a long history of great division in our state -- classism and racism have impacted every issue of our lives. I do not believe that we need to reconnect with each other; I believe that a new relationship paradigm must be molded. We are broken, and simply getting back to the way things were will not heal our brokenness. I have met some really good white people who are so deeply rooted within systemic racism that they don't even realize their actions and inactions are racist behaviors and thoughts -- to them, it's just the way things are. Brown's blood spilling out onto that street in Ferguson was symbolic of the blood that is spilling out of America's heart. The answer to a broken heart is not found in calling for more force. The heart needs healing -- healing, Governor, healing! Missouri governor declares state of emergency . Our movement reminds me of Blind Bartimaeus in Mark 10:46-52. The scripture says that when Bartimaeus heard Jesus was passing by, he cried out for wholeness. As others told him to be quiet, he cried out all the more. Bartimaeus didn't have anything to lose, and in this divine moment he decided that the possibility of being whole was worth the risk of remaining broken. Bartimaeus summoned every ounce of courage and boldness within him and the scripture says he shouted out all the more until his voice was heard -- until he got access to the wholeness he knew was possible. Bartimaeus has been crying out in St. Louis for more than 100 days and has been dealt with harshly by the use of rubber bullets, tear gas, pepper spray and wooden batons. Yet Bartimaeus has cried out all the more. As the heart of America is made whole, lifeblood will pump through throughout this nation. We -- black, white, Latino; across socioeconomic class; interfaith; clergy, politicians and other leaders; children, young adults and elders -- have collectively determined that the possibility of being whole is worth the risk of remaining broken. We are not going away. Not with tear gas, not with pepper spray, not with beatings, not with arrest. We will spread our cries to the furthest reaches of this city until the process of wholeness has begun. It is my prayer that the governor will do as Jesus did and hear Bartimaeus crying out and bring healing to the heart of America.","The people of Ferguson are grieving, the Rev. Renita Lamkin says .
Missouri is heart of America, and America's heart is broken, she says .
The answer to a broken heart is not found in calling for more force, Lamkin says ."
"(CNN) -- Syrian opposition voices spoke out Monday against a proposed law that would allow for new political parties, calling it little more than a publicity stunt. If enacted, the bill would add to a long list long list of reform promises going back at least five years. ""The Syrian regime is just easing international pressure to implement political and social reforms in Syria. The regime is simply constitutionalizing dictatorship through this new law that lacks basic elements for political parties to be formed freely,"" said Hassan Chalabi, a member of the Syrian National Salvage Congress. Chalabi said the proposal ""does not fulfill the aspirations of the opposition and the people of Syria."" Others say the prerequisites required to form a new party make it nearly impossible to do so. ""The law stipulates that any political party needs to have at least 2,000 members representing at least seven Syrian provinces before being active,"" said Damascus lawyer Anwar Al Bounni, who heads the Syrian Center for Legal Studies and Research. He added that the parties cannot be active until they are legalized by a committee formed by the minister of interior, a judge and three other members appointed by the president. This stipulation, Al Bounni said, makes it impossible for opposition parties to establish a presence, despite the new law. ""The law issued by the Syrian government is just for the media consumption and to delude the international community that the Syrian regime is implementing reforms. The reality is that it is not,"" Al Bounni said. Anti-regime demonstrators took to the streets Sunday night, chanting for the fall of the regime into the early hours of Monday, according to activists and protest videos posted on the Internet. State media also reported the sacking of two regional governors as a move to appease Syrian citizens. The governors replacing those sacked were to do more ""to meet the citizens' demands and interests,"" according to the SANA state news agency. More than 12,000 demonstrators participated in two towns alone, dissident organization Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Videos posted on YouTube showed public squares of at least five cities packed with nighttime protesters. Pro-democracy activists renewed their claim of a government ""detention campaign"" and reported 15 arrests in a Damascus suburb during a demonstration in support of the city of Homs, which is under a military crackdown. CNN cannot independently confirm the demonstrations or detentions. Syria's Cabinet approved the bill Sunday to provide for the formation of new political parties, according to SANA, ""as part of the directives of the political reform program."" It would require that new parties adhere to principles similar to those of Western democracies, SANA reported. But new parties would not be allowed to have members ""convicted of an offense or felony."" Past announcements of reform have done little to quell protests. Online videos posted Monday morning showed protesters reaffirming demands of regime change, chanting: ""The people want the fall of the regime."" President Bashir al-Assad had introduced economic and, to a lesser extent, political reforms in Syria as early as 2006, according to a July 2006 report by the Carnegie Endowment. Those reforms were ""more cosmetic than consequential,"" the report concluded. Human Rights Watch says Syrian security forces have intensified their campaign of mass arrests in cities that have had anti-government protests. The cities include Hama, Homs and suburbs around Damascus, the group said. Citing ""reliable activists and witnesses,"" it estimated that security forces have arrested more than 2,000 anti-government protesters, medical professionals caring for wounded protesters and people alleged to have given information to international news media and human rights organizations. Local Coordination Committees of Syria estimates that more than 15,000 people arrested since the beginning of the protests remain in detention, Human Rights Watch said. The organization said it had ""already documented widespread torture from the accounts of people who have been released, causing concern that many detainees still in detention are being tortured."" The unrest in Syria began in mid-March after teens were arrested for writing anti-government graffiti in the southern city of Daraa, according to Amnesty International. As the clashes intensified, demonstrators changed their demands, from calls for freedom and an end to abuses by the security forces to calls for the regime's overthrow. CNN's Rima Maktabi contributed to this report.","The opposition says the proposed law is ""constitutionalizing dictatorship""

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- A stampede at a hilltop temple in western India killed more than 147 people and wounded 55 others who had gathered to celebrate the start of a religious holiday on Tuesday, police said. Victims of the stampede near an Indian Hindu temple are carried away from the scene. More than 25,000 devotees were trying to reach the 15th-century temple through a steep and narrow pathway when the stampede occurred about dawn Tuesday, officials said. The Chamunda Devi temple is inside a fort atop a hill in Jodhpur, the second-largest city and a popular tourist destination in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Authorities do not know what prompted the rush, but state Police Chief K.S. Bains rejected as ""baseless"" reports that it was triggered by rumors of a bomb. ""But one thing is clear: that a cascading effect did take place as it was a slope where it happened,"" he said.  Watch as stampede mars religious holiday Â» . India has been on edge in recent days after a string of deadly bombings across the country. The crowd had gathered to celebrate the start of Navaratri, or nine nights. For nine nights and 10 days, Hindus worship the various forms of a Hindu goddess. Rajasthan Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria said police had planned for the event and deployed ""enough"" officers for crowd control. But the massive numbers overwhelmed them. After the stampede, devotees -- some in blood-soaked shirts -- carried the limp bodies of victims on to police vehicles while emergency officials frantically tried to tend to the wounded. Temple stampedes are not uncommon in India during religious festivals. Last month, more than 130 people were killed when panicked worshippers tried to flee a crowded mountaintop Hindu temple in northern India. That stampede, which occurred on the second day of a nine-day religious festival at the Naina Devi Temple in Himachal Pradesh state, apparently was triggered by a false rumor of a landslide on the hill above the crowd. And in January 2005, more than 250 people were trampled to death during a pilgrimage in the western state of Maharashtra. CNN's Harmeet Singh contributed to this report.","At least 147 people killed, 55 injured in India temple stampede .

"(CNN) -- The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda on Thursday convicted the ""mastermind"" of the Rwandan genocide and sentenced him to life in prison for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. Theoneste Bagosora, right, and his co-defendant Anatole Nsengiyumva, left, arrive in court. It is the first time the tribunal has convicted high-level officials for the 100-day genocide in 1994 which left an estimated 800,000 people dead. Theoneste Bagosora, 67, a colonel in the Rwandan army, was found guilty along with two other men -- Major Aloys Ntabakuze and Lieutenant Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva. All were sentenced to life in prison. The tribunal -- located in Arusha, Tanzania -- acquitted General Gratien Kabiligi, the former head of military operations, and ordered his immediate release. CNN Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour -- who covered the story -- called the verdicts ""a real turning point and a milestone in justice.""  Watch CNN's Christiane Amanpour on the verdict Â» . ""It sends a message that right up the chain of command, you cannot hide,"" Amanpour said. The court said Bagosora was a key figure in drawing up plans for the genocide. A Hutu, Bagosora was convicted of ordering Hutu militia to slaughter rival Tutsis. The massacres began after a plane crash on April 6, 1994 that killed the presidents of Rwanda and neighboring Burundi. The court said the plane was brought down by a surface-to-air missile fired from the airport in Kigali, the Rwandan capital.  Watch what happened in the court Â» . Bagosora decided the military should take over and he refused to involve the prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, in any discussions, the court found. April 7, while Bagosora held a crisis meeting with top military officials, the prime minister was arrested, sexually assaulted and killed by top members of the Rwandan Army, the court found.  Find out more about the world's killing fields Â» . That made Bagosora the head of all political and military affairs in Rwanda, and in that capacity, he was at the top of the chain of command. The same day the prime minister was killed, the court said, army personnel confined and killed four important opposition leaders -- including the president of the constitutional court and government ministers -- and murdered 10 Belgian peacekeepers who had been dispatched to the prime minister's residence. The court found Bagosora bore responsibility for those and other killings because he commanded those who carried out the crimes. ""Bagosora was the highest authority in the Ministry of Defense and exercised effective control of the Rwandan army and gendarmerie,"" said Presiding Judge Erik Mose. ""He's therefore responsible for the murder of the prime minister, the four opposition politicians, the 10 Belgian peacekeepers, as well as the extensive military involvement in the killing of civilians during this period."" ICTR Prosecutor Hassan Bubacar Jallow said the convicted men ""prepared, planned, ordered, directed, incited, encouraged and approved the murder of innocent civilian Tutsis."" The killings were carried out by military personnel on the orders of Rwandan authorities including Bagosora, the court said. The court found that from April to July 1994, Bagosora exercised authority over members of the Rwandan Army and their militiamen, who committed massacres throughout Rwanda with Bagosora's knowledge. ""In all the regions of the country, members of the Tutsi population who were fleeing from the massacres on their hills sought refuge in locations they thought would be safe, often on the recommendation of the local civil and military authorities,"" the indictment said. ""In many of these places, despite the promise that they would be protected by the local civil and military authorities, the refugees were attacked, abducted and massacred, often on the orders or with the complicity of those same authorities."" The indictment against Bagosora alleged he had been opposed to concessions made by his government to Tutsi rebels at 1993 peace talks in Tanzania, and had left the negotiations saying he was returning to Rwanda to ""prepare the apocalypse."" The U.N. established the tribunal in late 1994. The trial began in April 2002 and has been deliberating since June 1, 2007. During the trial, the court heard 242 witnesses -- 82 for the prosecution and 160 for the defense. The three convicted men will be held in the tribunal's custody until a state can be found to house them. The genocide's impact is still be felt today, with recent fighting in neighbouring Congo blamed on lingering tensions from the slaughter. Rebel leader Laurent Nkunda says his forces are fighting to defend Congolese Tutsis from Hutu militants who escaped to Congo.","Bagosora guilty of masterminding genocide which left at least 800,000 dead .

"You'll have to pardon the people of Hawaii if they are freaking out over an approaching hurricane. It's the kind of thing that rarely happens around there. And there are two headed that way. There's Hurricane Iselle, which looks like it will smack into the Big Island on Thursday night, and the less threatening Hurricane Julio, due a few days later. The Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu issued a hurricane warning for Hawaii County on Wednesday afternoon. ""Tropical storm conditions are expected on the Big Island of Hawaii Thursday, with hurricane conditions expected Thursday night,"" the center advised. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 90 mph on Wednesday night but Iselle was expected to weaken as it nears Hawaii. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for the islands of Lanai, Maui, Molokai and Oahu. Hawaii is a rare target for any tropical cyclone, let alone two. In Hilo, people were standing on beaches, anxiously looking out at the water. ""The surfers get excited about these storms, but everyone else is freaking out,"" said Chris Owens, owner of East Side Builders and a longtime resident. ""A lot of the locals here believe that the tall mountains on the Big Island shield them from hurricanes, but in 24 hours this theory could be proven wrong."" Customers formed lines from the front to the back of a Cost-U-Less store on Tuesday, clearing shelves of bottled water and stocking up on other supplies. ""A lot of rice, water, toilet paper,"" store worker Mike Kelley told CNN affiliate KGMB. Bottled water also was sold out at a Honolulu-area Costco. ""So we're going to bottle up water at home now and just pray for the best,"" would-be customer Lisa Viela told CNN affiliate KHON on Tuesday. Jackie Collins joined a steady stream of drivers trying to fill up vehicle gas tanks at the same Costco. ""We came last night, but it was too crowded, so I thought, 'Well, today I'd better go,'"" she told KHON. Not everyone was worried. Scott Murray, who owns the Hilo Surfboard Co. and has lived on the Big Island for more than 60 years, said many residents were more optimistic for good surf than concerned about damage and flooding. ""I'm not really worried about his storm,"" Murray said. The schools on the Big Island and Maui will be closed Thursday as residents await Iselle's arrival. Hawaii's primary elections will go on as scheduled Saturday, despite the storms, KGMB reported. Local media reported that many turned up for early voting in expectation of severe weather on election day. Others are concerned that voter turnout could be affected. Julio, also churning westward in the Pacific, could potentially brush the islands on Sunday as a tropical storm, forecasters said. Iselle is expected to bring heavy rain and high surf, which could lead to coastal flooding on islands already saturated by recent rains, the National Weather Service said. Julio is expected to move north of Hawaii on Sunday, but outer bands of rain and strong winds still could affect the islands. Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie signed an emergency proclamation, his office said. It gives the government access to the state's disaster funds. Some airlines are making concessions to customers ahead of the storms. For people who had been scheduled to travel to or from Hawaiian airports on Thursday and Friday, United Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines say they won't charge fees to change reservations, and they'll waive differences in fares for those changes. Island Air will do the same for passengers ticketed from Thursday though Tuesday. Delta said it would waive fees for reservation changes for Thursday and Friday, but fare increases could apply. Hawaii doesn't often have to prepare for cyclones.  A 2002 report by the U.S. Geological Survey said that ""actual hurricane strikes on the Hawaiian Islands are relatively rare in the modern record."" ""More commonly, near-misses that generate large swell and moderately high winds causing varying degrees of damage are the hallmark of hurricanes passing close to the islands,"" according to the report.","Big Island under hurricane warning, Hurricane Iselle expected Thursday night .
Hurricanes and other tropical cyclones rarely make landfall in Hawaii .

"A new Maine-based activist group released a detailed proposal on how to legalize recreational marijuana this week, potentially adding Maine to the growing list of states nationwide where use of the drug is permitted. These efforts by Legalize Maine, based largely on an agenda of statewide economic growth, mark the second attempt in the state in recent months to put pot before voters in 2016. Paul McCarrier, the group's leader, highlighted the potential benefits of pot legalization -- including a substantial boost in tourism -- in a press conference in the state's capital Wednesday. ""Our goal is a rural economic revival,"" he said, according to the Portland Press Herald. ""Rural Maine is dying and we need to stop that. Marijuana is not the golden ticket, but it's part of the solution."" To be eligible for a voter referendum in November 2016, about 61,000 signatures would be needed by January 2016. McCarrier said the group hopes to collect about 80,000 signatures in the state, and will start their activism soon. If the plan is approved, adults aged 21 and older would be allowed to possess an unlimited amount of pot in their homes -- and they'd also be permitted to grow the plant, provided they obtain a license. The goal is to give at least 75 percent of these licenses to owners of small farms in an effort to cultivate statewide industry. Like alcohol, marijuana would be taxed at 8%, and its use would be permitted in clubs. The Marijuana Policy Project, a national group based in Washington, D.C., is also working toward a ballot initiative in Maine. This group also needs signatures to make it on the ballot -- but so far, it is unclear whether the two activist organizations will work together. In some Maine cities, voters voiced support earlier this month for recreational pot legalization, while the initiative was defeated in other regions. These votes were largely symbolic, though, as there is not yet any overarching state or federal laws on the books. Medical marijuana has been legal in the Pine Tree State since 1999. So far, only four states -- Colorado, Washington, Alaska and Oregon, as well as D.C. -- have legalized recreational marijuana. Laws in these places remain hazy, as consuming marijuana is still listed as a Schedule 1 narcotic under federal law. As the tide continues to turn in favor of legal marijuana on the state level, a bipartisan group members of Congress have clamored for legal adjustments on the national level. ""It's not more dangerous than methamphetamines or cocaine,"" said Oregon Democratic Rep. Earl Blumenauer at an event last week, pointing out that there were zero deaths caused by marijuana last year. For the first time, most Americans favored pot legalization in October: The idea garnered 58% percent support, according to an October Gallup poll.","A new group in Maine wants to put pot on the statewide ballot in 2016 .

"More than six weeks after being shot, reportedly by his own troops, President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz returned home Saturday evening from France, where he'd been receiving medical treatment. After arriving at Nouakchott Airport in the West African nation's capital, Aziz met with government officials and legislative leaders, according to the state-run AMI news agency. He later traveled through the city streets in an open-air convertible, waving as the car rolled through a throng of supporters, some of whom held up pictures and cheered his return by dancing and shouting ""Aziz!"" The president discussed his health in an interview with Radio France International, as reported Saturday AMI, saying he is ""generally OK and ... thankfully regaining my health."" Aziz said bullets hit his intestines and possibly his colon, while his kidneys and liver were spared. ""There were no complications or problems, but doctors (exercised) caution,"" he said, explaining why it took him so long to come back to Mauritania. ""I ... lost a significant amount of blood due to injury, but most of the organs did not suffer."" It was on October 14, that the president's convoy came under fire as it headed back toward Nouakchott. Witnesses told the independent Mauritania News agency they thought this shooting was an assassination attempt, because unknown men shot at the president and ran away. But state news reported that members of a military unit stationed alongside the road shot at the president. And Aziz himself refuted the possibility he had been targeted in a coup d'etat, saying on state television the next day that the shooting was not intentional and that he'd be OK. ""I want to reassure all citizens of my well-being after the accident committed by an army unit on an unpaved road,"" Aziz said. ""Everything is fine."" The president added he'd had a successful operation to treat what he described as minor injuries, but then left Mauritania for France for continued medical treatment. In his recent interview with Radio France International, he said he ""always worked"" even during his recovery in France, adding that he'd kept close contact with Mauritania's prime minister, Cabinet ministers and leading politicians. A former general, Aziz came to power in a bloodless 2008 military coup -- one of many such coups the country of about 3.4 million people has had since it gained independence from France in 1960. He ousted Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, who had been the nation's first democratically elected leader, according to the U.S. State Department. Aziz was elected president in 2009. Still, the CIA describes the country's leadership as a ""military junta."" Beyond its historic political instability, Mauritania faces threats posed by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Mauritania: Slavery's last stronghold . Security was ratcheted up earlier this year amid concerns of ""armed terrorist groups"" in nearby northern Mali, according to Magharebia, a website sponsored by the U.S. Africa Command -- a part of the U.S. military focused on the continent. The measures include a bolstered security presence on main streets, near embassies and by government buildings in Nouakchott, as well as stepped-up patrols, Magharebia said.","President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz was shot October 14, reportedly by his own troops .

"More than 220 people have been rescued after two ice floes broke off from the Latvian coast and were blown into the Gulf of Riga, Latvian emergency services said Friday. All 181 people on the larger floe near the capital city of Riga were removed by boat, and 42 people were rescued by helicopter from the smaller floe off the coast of Jurmala, a nearby seaside resort town. One person remained for some time on the floe off Jurmala because he refused to be rescued by helicopter, emergency officials said. That man told authorities he was waiting for a friend to pick him up in a plastic boat, according to the Baltic News Service. Eventually, rescuers helped both the stranded man and his friend on the boat return safely to shore. The same report said that, once the rescue operation ended around 4:30 p.m. (10:30 a.m. ET), one person was treated for possible frostbite. The fire service earlier said that rough seas were complicating the rescue efforts by the Fire and Rescue Service, National Border Guard, Coast Guard and military officials. Oil company manager Kaspars Skrabans said he was down at the beach by Jurmala with his family when he noticed that a crack had appeared in the ice extending from the shore out into the gulf. He realized that nearly 50 people were on the ice that had become separated from the shore and being blown out to sea by the prevailing wind. Some people were likely there to enjoy a walk on a sunny day, he told CNN, while others were ice fishers. Temperatures were above freezing Friday in Riga, CNN forecaster Mari Ramos said. Ice is more likely to break off from shore as temperatures rise in spring.","A man who first refused help is taken safely back to shore, a report says .

"(CNN) -- Snapchat may be the latest application with a new mobile payment feature launched this week, but the idea that made Snapcash possible was spawned more than seven years ago in Africa. When M-Pesa came on the scene in 2007 -- a money transfer system devised by Vodafone and Kenya-based Safaricom - it sparked a mini-revolution. With the touch of a button, relatives in Nairobi could transfer cash instantly to their remote up-country families without the need for bank accounts, bureaucracy, and sometimes long journeys to settle accounts. Experimental beginnings . Initially launched as an experiment in creating a development impact through a private-sector solution, and seeded with as little as Â£2 million (US$3.1 million) in competition money, the system has gone from strength to strength. M-Pesa has nearly 17 million active customers and as many as 186,000 agents worldwide. Customers make more than â¬900 million (US$1.1 billion) worth of person-to-person transactions a month. In 2013, it shifted a massive US$22 billion in wireless financial transactions. Now, the technology that was honed in Africa is being exported to Europe, with the launch of the mobile wallet technology in Romania. ""The majority of people in Romania have at least one mobile device, but more than one-third of the population do not have access to conventional banking,"" said Vodafone director of mobile money, Michael Joseph. While it is early days in Romania -- the company only made its active launch in August this year -- analysts are cautiously optimistic about the prospects for its success. ""By Vodafone's estimation, 35 percent of the Romanian population don't use banking services and, if you look at Vodafone's footprint in Europe, Romania is one of the places where M-Pesa stands the best chance of gaining adoption,"" mobile analyst for IHS Technology Jack Kent told CNN. ""In more developed markets, like the U.K. and Germany, there isn't a role for this type of payment system. This service really works where people need an alternative to traditional banking."" Expanded potential . When Safaricom partnered with Vodafone, the intention had been to develop a system for women, usually the recipients of microfinance, to repay micro-loans cheaply and quickly. But after Safaricom's management team looked at the application, they saw it had a greater potential. Kenyans now use it to pay school fees, taxes, traffic fines, and more recently it's been extended to give people the ability to save and to borrow. Other more sophisticated financial services are also being introduced. The mobile payment system covers microinsurance, payrolls and even distributors like Diageo, which deliver beer to bars, take M-Pesa payments rather than have the delivery trucks go around with cash. It has even extended into Kenya's real estate and rental market with a service called Lipa Kodiâ Swahili for ""pay your rent."" Kenya's rental market is a large and growing segment (the latest census estimated there were 6.5 million rental households) as the country rapidly urbanizes. Valued at around 17.2 billion Kenyan shillings (US$200 million), it represents a fifth of the total value of the real estate market in Kenya. Within five years, M-Pesa contributes almost 20% of Safaricom's total revenue and has been rolled out in Egypt, Lesotho and Mozambique, before first venturing outside Africa into India. Universal appeal . While it was originally designed for and aimed at those at the bottom of the pyramid, M-Pesa is used by almost everyone that needs to move money in Kenya, allowing users to transfer between US$1,500--US$1,600 per day. Recent services, such as the credit application M-Shwari, however, have come under fire over what critics claim are high levels of interest charged to Kenya's poorest. Even though the loans are small, typically just $300, they have a 30-day term at 7.5%. On an annualized basis, critics say, the loans attract an interest rate of about 100%. Additionally, a higher rate of interest applies if the loan is paid either early or late and a subscriber's savings account is frozen up to the amount due. Nevertheless, for many analysts, M-Pesa is an example of a successful social enterpriseâa system that not only has a clear social benefit but returns a profit as well. For detractors of Africa's dependence on foreign aid, applications like M-Pesa are the way forward. Ironically, aid organizations are using M-Pesa themselves to direct cash payments. ""When it was started, it wasn't even conceived as a social enterprise; I don't think it was even a popular term at the time,"" Safaricom CEO Bob Collymore told CFA Magazine. ""But now, USAID, which distributes aidâand often this aid evaporates; it's stolenâthese guys use M-Pesa to get the benefit directly to the person who is receiving it.""

"Just don't expect thrift store prices. More than 120 rare and vintage handbags estimated to be worth almost $1 million will go under the hammer in Hong Kong on Monday at a sale organized by auction house Christie's. It's the first time the 248-year-old company, better known for its sales of fine art, has sold handbags as a separate category at auction. Previous sales took place online. Highlights include a 1993 Hermes Kelly bag made from saltwater crocodile skin with gold clasps in a rare shade of dark blue. It's estimated to sell for between $20,000 and $25,000. And a matte gray crocodile skin Hermes Birkin -- regarded by some as handbag holy grail -- is estimated to be snapped up for as much as $58,000. Wealthy Asian buyers . Christie's picked Hong Kong to appeal to the growing number of wealthy Asian buyers that have made the city the world's third largest auction center after London and New York. ""Asian art collectors have always appreciated the craftmanship and aesthetics of the fine leather goods created by the top European houses,"" said Rebecca Wei, president of Christie's Asia.

"When George W. Bush couldn't get an immigration overhaul though the Senate, he gave up. When Barack Obama couldn't get a bill through the House, he changed the rules. Rewriting the immigration system was at the core of Bush's ""compassionate conservatism"" political brand and was dear to his heart. ""It didn't work,"" a deflated Bush said on a June day seven years ago when the comprehensive reform effort finally died on Capitol Hill. Faced with failure, he asked his team if he could reshape the immigration system with his own executive power, but they concluded he couldn't. So Bush -- a president who fought the war on terror with an expansive interpretation of executive power -- moved on to other things for his last 18 months in office. Obama refuses to accept the same fate. When immigration reform died in Congress this year, Obama, like Bush, asked his lawyers if he could change the system on his own. This White House team came to the opposite conclusion. So, more than 500 days since the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration bill, Obama unveiled his plan to go it alone. In a prime-time address, he announced he would wield executive power to patch up the system as best he could, temporarily shielding up to five million people from the threat of deportation. He said he had no choice but to go ahead â despite furious claims by Republicans he is subverting the Constitution and behaving more like a king than a weakened president hemmed in by a hostile Congress. ""To those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress have failed, I have one answer. Pass a bill,"" Obama said. The president plans to offer temporary relief from deportation to the parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have been in the country for more than five years. He'll also extend a program that already allows undocumented migrants brought here as children to stay in the country. The measures are far short of the fix that Obama had hoped a permanent comprehensive immigration bill would provide. And since he was forced to act via executive order, his moves could be wiped out with the stroke of a pen by a future president. But it's clear that Obama is motivated by far more than the prosaic business of fixing the broken immigration system. In the two weeks since the Republican rout in the mid-term elections dealt what many had thought was a killer blow to his presidency, Obama has been working at a furious pace. A president who believes he was elected twice to engineer change is not giving up just because Congress is in his way. Republican House Speaker John Boehner is noticing and warning of retribution. ""President Obama has cemented his legacy of lawlessness and squandered what little credibility he had left,"" Boehner said. Reforming immigration was always on Obama's mind when he took office. ""It was on the big bucket list of why he was running for president,"" said a White House official. ""Climate, immigration and health care were problems that have eluded presidents for decades."" ""He really thought he had an opportunity to take on all three,"" the official said. ""It looks like he is going to make progress on all three."" Events that led to Thursday night's address had been unfolding for months, a factor that may explain the noticeable lack of drama surrounding Obama's announcement. WATCH: McConnell: Executive action ignores law . There was none of the excruciating tension or euphoria that greeted other signature moments of the Obama presidency â like the killing of Osama bin Laden, or the passage of health care reform. Senior administration officials confided that Obama signed off on the final details of the plan when he got back from Asia this week. But administration lawyers had been beavering away for months to flesh out legal justifications. Many in the White House had thought that it would never get to this point. In June 2013, when the Senate bill passed, administration insiders thought that the House would put a new law on Obama's desk to sign. Officials reasoned that if the Republican Party was ever going to capture the White House again, it needed to mend fences with Hispanic voters after Mitt Romney was wiped out among the crucial voting block in 2012. ""It was clear there was going to be momentum for this,"" the official said. Knowing his political brand was radioactive for Boehner, Obama deliberately stepped back in the days after the Senate bill passed. But his patience began to fray as the months dragged on. All the time, Obama was feeling heat from immigration activists in his liberal political base  â so much so that he made a series of statements to the effect that he couldn't just lash out and fix immigration on his own. Those comments -- intended to give the House space to do its work -- have instead come back to haunt him and are ammunition for Republicans who say Obama knows he is breaking the law. In the end, it seems Boehner did not believe his position was sustainable atop a restive Republican caucus if he used Democratic votes to pass a bill . A separate senior White House official said Thursday that the administration had concluded there was no point waiting any longer because Boehner would not promise to bring up a new bill in the new Congress. ""I don't think there will be a moment when the Republicans won't say 'just wait another day,' the official said. The showdown that precipitated Thursday's speech happened back in June. Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson were in the White House at a PGA Tour event â which might have been a rare moment for Boehner and Obama to bond over one of the few passions they share: golf. But afterwards, the president was seething because Boehner told him he would not be sending him a bill on immigration. The Speaker later said he told the president that the American people simply ""don't trust him to enforce the law as written."" The decision came against a backdrop of a boiling crisis on the southern border as thousands of child migrants were teeming across the border. Republicans charged the human tide was triggered directly by the President's earlier executive order that offered certain categories of Dreamers â undocumented immigrants brought the nation as children â relief from deportation. In a mid-term election year, Republicans had also been spooked by the stunning primary loss of Republican House majority leader Eric Cantor, who was accused by his insurgent opponent of being too soft on ""amnesty."" Obama snapped in an event a few days later in a Rose Garden speech. ""Pass a bill; solve a problem. Don't just say no on something that everybody needs to be done,"" he said.","Obama presses on where Bush failed on immigration .

"The Rev. Renita Lamkin says she has experienced some of the worst kind of racism in her life, which might come as a surprise to folks when they meet her. Lamkin is white. On August 9, as temperatures soared outside, she heard about something heating up tensions a short drive away from the city where she preaches. The next day, something inside her told her to go there. So she headed to Ferguson, not sure what she would encounter and with no real plan. ""I just got this feeling that there was a need for intercession, for prayer, and I needed to be there,"" Lamkin says. When she got there, she found out just what was sending emotions sky-high -- something the world would come to know about in the hours, days and weeks ahead. An African-American teenager named Michael Brown had been shot and killed in the street by a white police officer. No one in the neighborhood where Brown was killed knew the officer's name at the time. What they did know was that Brown's body had been lying in the street for about four hours. Some witnesses to the shooting said Brown's hands were up in surrender before he was killed. By the time Lamkin arrived on August 10, Brown's body was gone, but residents' anger remained high as she attended a prayer vigil on the street where the teen died. The protesting was peaceful at first. ""At some point I was told I should leave, and so I left, and by the time I got home I heard about the riots that had broken out,"" she says. A tale of two streets in Ferguson . A QuikTrip convenience store had been burned, some businesses had been looted, and what looked like an army of police had descended on West Florissant Avenue. A few days later, Lamkin went out to the street, too. On the night of August 13. she found herself in the middle of police and protesters when tear gas and rubber bullets began to fly. That is when she says she knew exactly why she was there and what she was called to do. ""In all fairness they (the police) did tell us to disperse many, many times, and they did say that failure to disperse would result in us being subject to arrest and or other actions. I had no idea what those other actions were, but I wasn't going to high-tail it out of there with our young people still hanging out,"" she says. She told the protesters to get behind her. She stood there with her hands outstretched between police in riot gear and protesters screaming at officers from a distance. In all that noise, Lamkin did the only thing she knew to do -- pray. ""It seems as if one minute there were police in shirts behind us, and when I turned around again there were tanks -- like I didn't even hear them approach,"" she says. What looked like tanks to some folks turned out to be armored vehicles. ""I just was praying, you know, just interceding, asking God to draw a line that couldn't be crossed either way. I didn't want to see our young people charge the police, and I didn't want to see the police charge at our young folks, and there's really no more to it than that,"" she says. But Lamkin soon was injured. She says she was shot by a police projectile. She disputes it was a rubber bullet, but police say that is what they were using that night. West Florissant looked like a battlefield, and Lamkin began to be incensed by what was happening in the usually quiet town eight miles from St Louis. It was then, Lamkin says, she became a praying protester, not just a praying pastor. Missouri governor declares state of emergency . 100 days of protests . For the most part, for more than 100 days now protesters have taken to the streets, chanting and leveling harsh words at police. Since Brown's killing, police have been face to face with protesters screaming, cursing and sometimes throwing water bottles or even rocks at them. Some demonstrators talk to police sometimes as if they are less than human. Lamkin says she understands the anger spewed at police. ""They're yelling at the system, and they are saying all the things that they were never able to say when they were in situations by themselves and they were in fear or when their family members were mistreated and ... they were powerless to speak up. "" Lamkin has a problem with the way she says the justice system treats people of color, especially black men. ""I believe that there is a nation of exhausted people. And we are exhausted with the policing system having carte blanche opportunity to gun our children down without accountability,"" she says. Plenty of folks argue a grand jury is there for the sole purpose of accountability. Its job is to see if criminal action has taken place. Lamkin and other protesters say they don't necessarily trust the grand jury system, which they see as a rubber stamp for the prosecuting attorney's office. The St. Louis prosecuting attorney has defended himself time and again, saying the jurors are getting all the information, witnesses and evidence the office has gathered to investigate and make up their minds. Ferguson awaits grand jury ruling . Prejudice hits home . As the mother of two mixed-race children, Lamkin says she doesn't have to travel far to find a black person who has dealt with racial profiling by police. ""My son was like 11 when he was brought home by the police for riding his bike, 'fitting the description' (of a criminal), like what the hell?"" she barks. "" 'You know he's in his own neighborhood?' "" Lamkin says she told the officer. His reply, she says, ""Well we didn't know any black families lived here."" Lamkin says she has experienced the deep prejudice that police and fellow white citizens have revealed to her often unconsciously. ""I have felt the disgrace when white people think that I adopted my children, then they say it's the great white person you know that has rescued these little black kids. Actually one time someone said, 'Where did you get them from?' "" Lamkin says, letting out an exasperated laugh. When she explains they are her biological children, the demeanor of the people asking those kinds of questions changes, she says. ""There's a shift; you know people shift when they realize that they're my children and that somehow I am no longer as quality of a being to them,"" Lamkin says. Police, protests and ominous predictions . At first, Lamkin was not welcomed by some of the protesters. ""Initially some would say like, 'What are you doing here? Whose side are you on? This isn't your fight. It's not a white person's fight,' "" she says. That all ended on the night she was injured, but that same evening, she confronted another protester. ""I saw her give Molotov cocktails to three of our boys, so I charged at her. Fortunately, she took the cocktail back and took off running before I was able to get to her,"" she says. Lamkin says worries that the announcement of the grand jury's decision will bring more folks intending to use the cover of peaceful protesters for their violent deeds. ""I've been pulled into secret meetings, I've received anonymous messages. If all of that prediction holds true, it's gonna to be very scary,"" she says. Violence has no place, even when you are fighting for what you believe in, she says. She has been accused of inciting violence for the way she yells at police, and has once worn a scarf around her face covering everything but her eyes. ""It's funny though -- all I'm doing is praying,"" Lamkin says. When a CNN crew saw her the first time, Lamkin was yelling at officers, waving her hands between them and protesters and telling police, ""Don't hurt them. They are all somebody's baby. Don't you hurt them!"" Lamkin says she doesn't condemn every police officer for the actions of some, nor does she praise every protester for his or her behavior. Ultimately she sees what's happening in Ferguson as a moment that turned into a movement. She is convinced it's not only a worldly battle between people and the system but something much bigger than that. ""I'm very aware of the presence of evil. I'm seeing this as a spiritual warfare,"" she says. Her take: The evil is an unfair system; the war is an effort to change that so that all people finally have the chance to be treated equally.","The Rev. Renita Lamkin has taken part in the protests in Ferguson, Missouri .

"The Maldives government has said its hands are tied in the case of a 15-year-old girl sentenced to 100 lashes and eight months house arrest for engaging in premarital sex. The registrar for the Juvenile Court confirmed Wednesday that the sentence had been imposed Tuesday, after the girl confessed during a court hearing to the charge of fornication. ""She's staying in a children's home now so we have ordered her to remain in a children's home,"" registrar Zaima Nasheed Aboobakur told CNN. ""We have explained to her how if she wants to receive the punishment (the lashings) right now she can ... or it can be postponed until she turns 18,"" she added. Amnesty International told CNN the same girl was the alleged victim of sexual abuse by her stepfather. The Juvenile Court registrar said she had no information on reported charges against the girl's stepfather, as that case was being dealt with by the Criminal Court, but she said that the teenager's fornication charge was unrelated to the stepfather's case. The prosecutor general told Amnesty International on Wednesday that it couldn't elaborate on the circumstances of the premarital sex other than that the girl had confessed to the offense, punishable under the Islamic country's Sharia laws, said Abbas Faiz, a researcher with the group. In not releasing further information to the group, the prosecutor general also cited protecting the minor's identity, Faiz told CNN. Maldives, a tourist destination, is an Indian Ocean archipelago of about 1,200 small islands, 200 of which are inhabited and typically have small populations. Neither the stepfather's name nor the girl's has been released to the public. CNN, meanwhile, has contacted the prosecutor's office about the specifics of the case against the girl and the allegations against her stepfather. In an e-mail response, the deputy prosecutor general said the office is, ""restricted by laws in relation to the amount we can share with (the) public when it involves a minor."" The prosecutor's office did promise to provide ""as much information as we can,"" but has not yet responded to CNN's follow-up e-mail. Faiz objected to how authorities used a confession from a sexually abused minor. The girl should have first received legal guidance and protection, he said. ""Confession from a child who has really gone through some damaging experiences cannot be taken as evidence,"" he said. ""If she had said no, then the only case that would have gone forward would have been the charge of sexually abusing a minor against the stepfather."" Authorities began their investigation after a dead baby was discovered, and investigators questioned the girl, who later confessed to consensual premarital sex, Faiz said. Amnesty International's sources close to the island where the sexual abuse had taken place provided this account, Faiz said. The investigation then led to a charge against the stepfather, Faiz said. Authorities haven't indicated to Amnesty International whether charges have been filed in the baby's death, Faiz said. The parents of the baby haven't been disclosed, he added. A spokesman for the President's Office, Masood Imad, told CNN the government considered the teenager to be a victim who should not be flogged but said the government was unable to intervene in the judicial process. ""We cannot just send a memo to the judiciary and say, 'Don't lash anybody hereafter.' It doesn't happen that way any more. We have to talk with them, get them to understand, get them to initiate the laws or we initiate the laws together and then pass it to the legislature,"" Imad said. He said the Ministry of Gender and Family was leading talks with the Ministry of Islamic Affairs to try to convince the judiciary that the law needs changing. ""We have to engage with the judiciary and we've got to suggest to them that we need to change these laws to better identify victims and perpetrators,"" Imad said. The circumstances surrounding the fornication charge against the girl are not known. The case attracted the attention of rights groups last month, when Amnesty International issued a statement urging the Maldivian authorities to drop all charges. ""She has been sexually abused, and at the same time, she has been charged with an offense that carries a punishment of flogging. We are really outraged at this punishment,"" Faiz told CNN on Wednesday. Human Rights Watch condemned the girl's punishment and urged the government to change the law. ""The Maldives should urgently reform its laws to ensure maximum protection for children instead of engaging in further punishing a child that they failed to protect,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, Human Rights Watch director for South Asia. Even as he condemned the sentencing, the president's spokesman, Imad, played down the physical effects of the lashing, referring to the punishment as ""ceremonial."" ""They just pretend she's been lashed. It's not a painful process. She is taken to one side and she is patted on her backside with this lashing. It's not used hard. It's just a token, a token exercise. It's a belief,"" Imad said. Aboobakur also said, ""the lashes are not given that hard."" She said she had witnessed floggings and that most people ""just keep quiet and still until it finishes."" She said floggings were carried out in a public area for adults, while the punishment was administered to juveniles in a separate area nearby. The recipient was not required to wear any specific clothing, she said, adding that the lashes were delivered to the upper thighs and buttocks. While Imad said the punishment didn't hurt, he acknowledged that the psychological impact of a flogging was undeniable. ""There are psychological consequences ... I understand this. I wouldn't want anybody, even with the talk of lashing, going through this process. But this is the hard reality and we're trying to change it."" However, Amnesty's Faiz said the government wasn't trying hard enough. ""It is for the government to actually initiate a change and send a bill to parliament and then if at that level they don't win, they can say we tried. But they haven't at this stage even tried,"" Faiz said. ""They are not interested, they don't show any interest in this,"" he added. ""Every time we talk about the judicial flaws that exist in the judicial system of the country they say we have nothing to do with that because we're separate from the judiciary. Of course you're separate to the judiciary but you're the government,"" he added. The Maldives is in a state of political flux after the resignation last year of the country's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Nasheed, who is facing charges of abuse of power -- charges he has denied. The charges leveled against the former president have focused attention on the country's legal system, which was most recently criticized by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers. After an eight-day visit to the country in February, Gabriela Knaul said she was, ""struck to hear how little trust the public has in the justice system in the Maldives."" After leaving the court after the girl's sentencing, registrar Aboobakur said the teenager seemed ""fine."" She said she didn't think the girl would appeal the sentence. Faiz said official claims that the floggings were ""not hard"" and only ""ceremonial"" were difficult to verify as those sentenced to the punishment were reluctant to speak about it. ""It is very difficult, to get any of these victims to come and talk about their experience,"" he said. ""Why is that? Because they feel ashamed, they feel there is a huge stigma in the country against that. It is a humiliating experience.""

"Hillary Clinton offered her firm backing Thursday of President Barack Obama's plan to issue an executive action to overhaul the nation's immigration system. ""I support the PresidentÂ¹s decision to begin fixing our broken immigration system and focus finite resources on deporting felons rather than families,"" Clinton said in a statement emailed to reporters after Obama finished his prime time address on the topic. ""I was hopeful that the bipartisan bill passed by the Senate in 2013 would spur the House of Representatives to act, but they refused even to advance an alternative."" Clinton went on to argue that although Congress wasn't able to ""finish the job by passing permanent bipartisan reform,"" she is ""confident that people of good will and good faith can yet find common ground."" Shortly after the speech ended, Clinton sent a tweet with a similar message. ""Thanks to POTUS for taking action on immigration in the face of inaction,"" she tweeted. ""Now let's turn to permanent bipartisan reform. #ImmigrationAction"" The fact that Clinton -- the prohibitive favorite for the Democrats' nomination in 2016 -- sent a paper statement on the issue is in itself telling. Since leaving the State Department in early 2013, Clinton has rarely issued statements to reporters in favor of using her high profile speeches to address issues in the news. But immigration has been an issue that followed Clinton for much of the last year. After telling NPR earlier this year that she would support looking at deportations for immigrant children coming to the United States, the former Secretary of State's appearances became frequent venues for immigration protests. ""I think it should be looked at as part of an overall package,"" she told NPR in July. In North Carolina and then again a few days later in Maryland, protesters interrupted Clinton's stump speech to call for her to come out against deportations. ""Choose families over politics,"" read one sign in Maryland. The protesters were usually from United We Dream, a pro-immigration reform group. Clinton responded in Maryland by stating that immigration is an ""important issue."" ""If they would have just waited a little while, I was getting to the DREAM Act,"" Clinton said. ""I am really proud to be in a state who has opened the doors of opportunity to students who work and study hard regardless of their parents immigration status.""","Clinton issued a statement and tweeted her support of Obama's immigration announcement .

"(CNN) -- The snowfall might be subsiding in the Buffalo area but officials are warning people the deadly weather emergency is not close to being over. Especially with rain in the weekend forecast. Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz told reporters Thursday that while the storm may be largely over for snow purposes, authorities are exceptionally worried that buildings will collapse when the heavy snow pack soaks up the rain. ""There's going to be a warm-up on Saturday, there will probably not be a tremendous amount of melt on Saturday,"" he said. ""There will be a rain starting on Saturday that will not initially create a situation where the snow will melt, but it will actually act as a sponge. So the water that is falling will go into the snow pack and will actually act as a sponge until it finally starts releasing it."" The National Weather Service forecasts light rain to begin Saturday and temperatures to warm. The major concern is flooding, but Poloncarz said the weight on buildings could cause some to collapse. ""There will be even extra weight because of the rain. So this emergency is not over,"" he warned. On Thursday afternoon, Erie County officials said there was a ""significant threat of a roof collapse"" at the 184-bed Garden Gate Health Care Facility in Cheektowaga. Residents reported wall cracks and a sagging ceiling. Several feet of snow piled on the roof. Poloncarz, who had earlier tweeted that the roof was collapsing, later clarified the statement, saying beams in the building were twisted and walls cracked. No injuries were reported and patients were evacuated. Residents were taken temporarily to a business park, said Scott Zylka with the Erie County Sheriff's Office, adding that the roof structure was compromised. The extreme weather has claimed at least 10 lives -- its latest victims two people with mental health issues who died of apparent exposure overnight, Dr. Gale R. Burstein, Erie County health commissioner, said Thursday. And the storm forced the NFL to announce that Sunday's game between Buffalo and the New York Jets, scheduled to be played at the Bills' Ralph Wilson Stadium, will be hosted at Detroit's Ford Field on Monday night. Seeking shelter . At the Winchester Volunteer Fire Company station on Harlem Street, as many as 40 people stranded in the snow have sought shelter since Tuesday. More than 6 feet of snow cover the streets. Abandoned cars are barely visible under the drifts. Fire trucks can't leave the station. Attempts by firefighters to get out in an SUV were futile. One medic hopped on a snowmobile to rush to a call. Other volunteers jumped on ATVs to reach a home where the roof was buckling under the weight of the snow. Maria Odom's two cats and a dog were rescued from the house. ""I'm ready for it to end,"" Odom, 38, said of the extreme weather. ""I've lived here my whole life and I've never seen anything like this."" At the fire station, driver Steve Randall's truckload of milk and eggs has served as the main source of provisions. Randall said he was stuck in his truck for nearly five hours before making his way to the firehouse, where people have been sleeping on tables to stay off the cold floor. ""We've been eating like kings for a while but now we're running out of food,"" he said. Firehouse occupants have been making quiche, served with milk and bread from a store across the street. From the Tops grocery store nearby, people hauling bags of food headed out into the snow by foot. One man dragged groceries in a sled; another pulled his child through the snow in a laundry basket. Robert Mead embarked on a five-mile trek to bring formula to his 9-month-old baby. A year's snowfall in 3 days? In the past 24 hours, since the latest lake-effect storm started on Wednesday night, more than 3 feet of snow has fallen in several areas near Buffalo. In Wales Center, there was a new snowfall of 37 inches, according to a National Weather Service spotter. Residents just stared out their windows at the mounds of white stuff, if they could see out at all. In East Aurora, Lisa Gutekunst's home was capped with more than 4 feet of snow, she said. ""The snow is coming down so hard you can't see out the window,"" she said earlier Thursday. ""We've cleared our driveway so many times that we've run out of places to put the snow."" Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown announced a travel ban in south Buffalo for both cars and pedestrians from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m., citing the safety of residents as heavy equipment moved around town. If the forecast holds, more than a year's worth of snow will have fallen in three days. In a typical year, Buffalo's snowfall totals about 7 feet, according to the National Weather Service. Extreme conditions lead to tragedy . Ten people have died, including four who suffered cardiac issues while they shoveled snow and one who died in a car accident, Erie County officials reported. A man in his 60s had a heart attack while he tried to move a snow plow or a snow blower, Erie County deputy executive Richard Tobe said. Burstein told reporters that two residents of Niagara and Erie counties died overnight Thursday of apparent exposure. ""They both had chronic illnesses,"" she said. ""They both had mental health issues, and were found outside either their home or a close friend's home. They had probably been there overnight."" In Alden, a 46-year-old man was found dead inside a car buried in 12 to 15 feet of snow. In Genesee County, Jack Boyce, a 56-year-old county employee, died after collapsing Tuesday morning while operating a snow blower outside the county sheriff's office, according to County Manager Jay Gsell. Brown and city officials recounted stories of rescuers trudging around snowdrifts as high as houses to get people to hospitals, and police officers delivering special baby formula to a pair of infants. A sporting chance . Wednesday night's football game between the University of Buffalo and Kent State was postponed because the visitors' equipment truck didn't arrive on time. The game has been tentatively rescheduled for Friday, school officials said in a statement. The National Football League announced it would move Sunday's game from Ralph Wilson Stadium, which was buried in an estimated 220,000 tons of snow. The NFL statement said the contest will be played Monday night at 7 ET at Ford Field, which in 2010 played host to a Minnesota Vikings game after the roof of their stadium collapsed due to snow accumulation. Moving the game back a day will help the Bills, who haven't been able to practice this week. The team had been offering tickets to the game and $10 an hour to anyone willing to help remove the snow. Now it is offering refunds to fans who purchased tickets through the team. CNN's Alexandra Field, Leigh Remizowski, Ashley Fantz, Jason Hanna, Ed Payne, Marcus Hooper, Martin Savidge and Catherine E.

"Ahead of me, a trail of lights snakes up toward the sky, moving relentlessly, step-by-step, in the darkness. I've tackled quite a few mountains in my life, but never have I hiked with as many solemn spirits as on Adam's Peak in Sri Lanka. Barefoot pilgrims are all around me. There are women, whose bangles can be heard rattling against tired ankles, and monks, pulling their maroon robes over their left shoulders to shield from the mountain chill. We're all going up silently toward the summit of what is a holy mountain for Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and Christians in Sri Lanka. The 2,243-meter (7,359 feet) Adam's Peak lies among the island nation's southern Central Highlands, 150 kilometers (93 miles) east of the capital Colombo. It's one of Sri Lanka's highest mountains, rising like a green fang from a carpet of dense forest reserve where wild elephants and leopards still dwell. It isn't the scenery or wildlife that daily pulls in thousands of pilgrims though. All of them are here to see a 1.8-meter-long rock formation that juts out from the summit. Tough going . To Buddhists, Sri Pada, or the sacred footprint, is an imprint left by the Buddha himself. Hindus say it belonged to Shiva while Christians and Muslims consider it a sign of Adam's passage. Local legend has it that Sri Lanka's King Valagambahu was the first to stumble upon Sri Pada during a reign that ended in about 76 BC. The peak gets another historic name check from none other than Marco Polo, who visited in the 14th century, reporting that his ascent was tough going. Today, a stone staircase helps almost every Sri Lankan tackle the peak several times during their lives. From December to May, the mountain glows nightly as torchlit pilgrims follow the trail to the top. Some climb in the afternoon to reach the shrine at sundown but the most popular and spiritual time to ascend is the middle of the night, summiting just in time to catch the first rays of dawn. Just getting to Adam's Peak is an act of devotion. Pure pilgrimage . After traveling from the central city town of Kandy to Hatton on a slow train through the relentless greenery of the area's Ceylonese tea estates, I catch a rickety bus to continue my journey. My destination is Dalhousie, a cluster of chai stalls, home stays and informal restaurants that marks the starting point of the five-kilometer Nallathanni climbing route, the shortest way to the summit. The basic facilities on offer are attuned to the reasons for the climb. This isn't a leisure pursuit, but a pure pilgrimage. My ascent begins at a chilly 3 a.m. The climb can take between two and a half and four hours -- I'm aiming to summit at the break of dawn at 6.30 a.m. Groups of pilgrims dressed in white lead me through the dark and to the beginning of the incline. ""Each time feels like the first,"" says Saman, a slender man from a village near Bentota on Sri Lanka's southern coast. He and his wife are tackling their fifth climb, accompanying their six-year-old son for his first ascent. Before the path starts rising, a monk from the nearby Japanese temple comes forward and in exchange for an offering, ties a white string around my waist as a form of blessing. And so, with the eyes of one of Sri Pada's benevolent gods hopefully on me, I proceed upward as the incline slowly turns into a stone staircase. Spiritual awakening? Along the way, vendors cook pans of soothing chai over portable gas stoves. Prices, like the sacred mountain, are steep. The peak comes into view a couple hours into the climb. Many hikers greet it with determined expressions, their only goal to arrive at Sri Pada before sunrise. As we get nearer, the darkness disperses in tones of blue. Just before dawn throws shards of burning red across the sky, we sail into a sea of pilgrims surrounding the shrine's platform. It's quite a sight. Pilgrims walk in circles reciting mantras, queuing up to pray before the sacred footprint. On the edge of the slope, young monks in wool hats hold their robes tight under their chins with chilled fingers, waiting for the sun's rays to bring the new day. With the sound of tolling bells at my back, I join the line and watch first light over central Sri Lanka. The spectacle is enough to stop my legs from aching and make me forget that I must, at some point, return to Earth. Getting there . Two daily trains leave from Kandy to Hatton. Number 1005 departs at 8:47 a.m. and arrives at 11:12 a.m. while number 1015 leaves at 11:10 a.m. and arrives at 13:26 p.m. Buses run to Dalhousie from Hatton's train station until early afternoon. During pilgrimage season (December to May), there are direct buses to Dalhousie from Colombo, Kandy and Nuwara Eliya. However, the scenic train route across the Hill Country is highly recommended.","The 2,243-meter (7,359 feet) Adam's Peak lies amid Sri Lanka's southern Central Highlands .

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- France on Wednesday said accusations by Rwanda that French politicians and military officials helped prepare and carry out the 1994 Rwandan genocide are ""unacceptable."" Alain Juppe, French foreign minister during the Rwanda genocide, calls the report an attempt to re-write history. Rwanda's Ministry of Justice released a report Tuesday detailing the alleged French role in the mass killings, which left 800,000 people dead in 100 days when Hutu extremists went on a rampage killing Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The report implicates 33 top French officials, including former French President Francois Mitterrand, and said French soldiers committed some of the killings. The report was compiled by an independent national commission in Rwanda. But France questioned the objectivity of the commission, which was formed to ""shed light on the role of France in the genocide of Tutsis in 1994,"" according to the Rwandan government's Web site. There is no surprise in the conclusions of the commission given its mission, the French Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It also decried the contents of the report. ""There are, in this report, unacceptable accusations leveled against French politicians and the French military,"" the Foreign Ministry said. Alain Juppe, who served as the French foreign minister at the time of the Rwandan massacres and who is named in the Rwandan report, said the panel's findings are part of Rwanda's efforts to ""re-write history."" ""We are witnessing for several years now an insidious attempt to re-write history,"" the French newspaper Le Figaro quoted Juppe as writing on his blog in January. ""(This effort's) goal is to transform France into a party engaged in complicity in the genocide. This is an unacceptable falsification,"" Juppe said in his blog, according to the article published Wednesday. ""During the time I was in charge of French diplomacy (April 1993 to May 1995), we made every effort possible to help in the reconciliation of Rwandans."" The French Government said it has cooperated with the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and has arrested Rwandan suspects in French territories wanted in connection with the genocide. In addition to Mitterrand, the report also names former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and Admiral Jacques Lanxade, who was army chief of staff from 1991 to 1995. It says they worked with the then-Rwandan government to carry out the genocide. ""French soldiers themselves directly were involved in assassinations of Tutsis and Hutus accused of hiding Tutsis,"" the report says. ""French soldiers committed many rapes, specifically with Tutsi women."" In announcing the findings of the independent commission on Rwandan television Tuesday, Justice Minister Tharcisse Karugarama said the report could be the basis for future legal action against former French politicians and military officials. In July, according to Le Figaro, Rwandan President Paul Kagame threatened to indict French officials in the matter unless European courts revoked arrest warrants issued against Rwandans named in the killings. The killings began April 7, 1994, the day after a plane carrying the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi was shot out of the sky with a missile as it prepared to land in the Rwandan capital of Kigali. The United Nations says the genocide was ""highly organized,"" with top government and ruling party officials playing a role. The United Nations says lists were drawn up of Tutsi and opposition leaders ""earmarked for assassination"" before the genocide began. French forces deployed to Rwanda in June 1994 for a humanitarian mission dubbed Operation Turquoise. France says the operation established safe humanitarian zones to shelter the population and that troops allowed thousands of others to escape the fighting. The Rwandan report says it was during Operation Turquoise that the French soldiers took part in assassinations and rapes -- acts based solely, the report says, on account of the victims' ethnicity.","France: Accusations of French role in Rwanda genocide are ""unacceptable""

"(CNN) -- The Colombian government said it would appeal to international bodies over what it called a threat made over the weekend by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. On his weekly Sunday television show, Chavez ordered the Venezuelan military to begin preparations for a war with the neighboring country, warning of a conspiracy between Colombia and the United States to attack Venezuela. ""The two governments have joined together to fool the world or to try to fool the world,"" Chavez said. Addressing his military commanders, he added, ""Let's not waste a single day in the preparation of our main mission: to prepare ourselves for war and to help the people prepare for war. It's everyone's responsibility."" On Sunday Colombia's government responded, saying it has not undertaken any hostile actions toward Venezuela. Colombia said it would ask for intervention from the United Nations Security Council and the Organization of American States. A Colombian government spokesman, Cesar Mauricio Velasquez, called Chavez's remarks ""war threats."" On Monday Venezuela retorted by calling Colombia's response ""hypocritical"" and ""immoral."" Chavez's accusations of threats from Colombia and the United States come from an agreement between the two countries that allows U.S. military personnel to be stationed at seven Colombian military bases. The Venezuelan leader is the leading critic of the agreement and has said that the agreement is part of a plot to destabilize his leftist government. ""Don't be mistaken, Mr. Obama, and order an overt aggression against Venezuela using Colombia,"" Chavez said Sunday, in a reference to U.S. President Barack Obama. ""Don't make that mistake, because we are willing to do whatever it takes. Venezuela will never again be a colony."" On Monday the U.S. State Department said it supported talks to defuse the conflict. ""We support Colombia's call for dialogue between Venezuela and Colombia to overcome recent tensions in the relationship,"" a State Department spokesman told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. ""As a member of the hemispheric community, we are prepared to work collaboratively to promote peaceful solutions to disputes in the region."" Relations between Colombia and Venezuela have been rocky since the summer. In August, Colombia accused Venezuela of supplying guerillas with shoulder-fired anti-tank weapons. Such weapons seized from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, had been traced to Venezuela, Colombia said. The FARC has been fighting the Colombian government for more than 45 years. Chavez, at the time, said the accusation amounted to blackmail. Last month Venezuelan authorities said they captured two Colombian spies. Colombia denied the claim. Also in October, near the border between the two countries, Venezuelan authorities found the murdered bodies of 10 men that Colombia described as an amateur soccer team that had been kidnapped near the border. Venezuela said the men were paramilitaries. Tensions were last stoked a week ago when two Venezuelan national guardsmen at an international bridge between the two countries were killed by gunmen on motorcycles. Venezuela blamed Colombian paramilitaries for the attacks, and accused the Colombian government of complacency toward such groups.","Colombia says it would ask for intervention from U.N.

"Cairo (CNN) -- A senior Egyptian general admits that ""virginity checks"" were performed on women arrested at a demonstration this spring, the first such admission after previous denials by military authorities. The allegations arose in an Amnesty International report, published weeks after the March 9 protest. It claimed female demonstrators were beaten, given electric shocks, strip-searched, threatened with prostitution charges and forced to submit to virginity checks. At that time, Maj. Amr Imam said 17 women had been arrested but denied allegations of torture or ""virginity tests."" But now a senior general who asked not to be identified said the virginity tests were conducted and defended the practice. ""The girls who were detained were not like your daughter or mine,"" the general said. ""These were girls who had camped out in tents with male protesters in Tahrir Square, and we found in the tents Molotov cocktails and (drugs)."" The general said the virginity checks were done so that the women wouldn't later claim they had been raped by Egyptian authorities. ""We didn't want them to say we had sexually assaulted or raped them, so we wanted to prove that they weren't virgins in the first place,"" the general said. ""None of them were (virgins)."" However, Gen. Mamdouh Shaheen, a member of Egypt's Supreme Council of Armed Forces, said the ""accusations that we did virginity tests are not acceptable. We denied it then and we deny it now."" This demonstration occurred nearly a month after Egypt's longtime President Hosni Mubarak stepped down amid a wave of popular and mostly peaceful unrest aimed at his ouster and the institution of democratic reforms. Afterward, Egypt's military -- which had largely stayed on the sidelines of the revolution -- officially took control of the nation's political apparatus as well, until an agreed-upon constitution and elections. The March 9 protest occurred in Tahrir Square, which became famous over 18 historic and sometimes bloody days and nights of protests that led to Mubarak's resignation. But unlike in those previous demonstrations, the Egyptian military targeted the protesters. Soldiers dragged dozens of demonstrators from the square and through the gates of the landmark Egyptian Museum. Salwa Hosseini, a 20-year-old hairdresser and one of the women named in the Amnesty report, described to CNN how uniformed soldiers tied her up on the museum's grounds, forced her to the ground and slapped her, then shocked her with a stun gun while calling her a prostitute. ""They wanted to teach us a lesson,"" Hosseini said soon after the Amnesty report came out. ""They wanted to make us feel that we do not have dignity."" The treatment got worse, Hosseini said, when she and the 16 other female prisoners were taken to a military detention center in Heikstep. There, she said, she and several of other female detainees were subjected to a ""virginity test."" ""We did not agree for a male doctor to perform the test,"" she said. But Hosseini said her captors forced her to comply by threatening her with more stun-gun shocks. ""I was going through a nervous breakdown at that moment,"" she recalled. ""There was no one standing during the test, except for a woman and the male doctor. But several soldiers were standing behind us watching the backside of the bed. I think they had them standing there as witnesses."" The senior Egyptian general said the 149 people detained after the March 9 protest were subsequently tried in military courts, and most have been sentenced to a year in prison. Authorities later revoked those sentences ""when we discovered that some of the detainees had university degrees, so we decided to give them a second chance,"" he said. The senior general reaffirmed that the military council was determined to make Egypt's democratic transition a success. ""The date for handover to a civil government can't come soon enough for the ruling military council,"" he said. ""The army can't wait to return to its barracks and do what it does best -- protect the nation's borders."" Journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","17 women were arrested at a March 9 protest in Cairo, after Mubarak's ouster .

"A Palestinian man has admitted to deliberately ramming a vehicle into three Israeli soldiers in the West Bank two weeks ago -- one of several recent cases of violence in the Palestinian territory or Jerusalem -- Israeli police said Thursday. Jamal Hamam Mesalmeh, 23,  turned himself in to Israeli authorities shortly after the November 5 incident near the village of al-Aroub and claimed it was an accident, police said. The soldiers suffered moderate injuries, officials said at the time. Israeli police said Mesalmeh is an activist associated with the Islamist Hamas movement. Police said he claimed he was inspired in part by an attack in eastern Jerusalem earlier November 5 -- one in which Israeli authorities said a Palestinian drove into pedestrians at a rail station, killing two Israelis and at least 12 other people before police shot and killed the driver. Tensions between Israelis and Palestinians have worsened in recent months, agitated in part by arguments over the Jerusalem holy site called the Temple Mount by Jews and Haram al-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary, by Muslims. Those incidents include Tuesday's attack on a Jerusalem synagogue, where Israeli authorities say two Palestinian cousins wielding a gun killed four worshipers and a police officer before the assailants themselves were killed. It was the deadliest attack in Jerusalem since 2008. Hamas did not claim responsibility for Tuesday's killings, but a spokesman for the group linked it to the discovery Sunday of a Palestinian bus driver hanged in his bus not far from the synagogue. Israeli authorities say the bus driver's death was a suicide, but his family disputes that, claiming he was attacked. The violence followed other hit-and-run incidents last month. On October 22, a Palestinian man rammed his car into commuters waiting at a light-rail stop in Jerusalem, killing a baby and wounding several other people Israeli police said. Three days earlier, a 5-year-old girl died after an Israeli settler deliberately ran her over as she returned him from kindergarten in the West Bank, Palestinian state news reported.","Jamal Hamam Mesalmeh, 23, claims he drove into soldiers on purpose, police say .

"About 4.7 million Graco and Century-branded strollers are being recalled after its maker received reports of 10 full or partial fingertip amputations and one laceration, federal officials said Thursday. Eleven models of strollers have a folding hinge on the side that ""can pinch a child's finger, posing a laceration or amputation hazard,"" officials said. Caregivers are being advised to show ""extreme care when unfolding the stroller to be certain that the hinges are firmly locked before placing a child in the stroller,"" the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said. ""Caregivers are advised to immediately remove the child from a stroller that begins to fold to keep their fingers from the side hinge area,"" the agency said. Atlanta-based Graco Children's Products received six reports of fingertip amputation, four reports of partial-fingertip amputation and one finger laceration, the product safety agency said. The firm manufactured the strollers in China and will be providing a free repair kit beginning in December. About 202,000 strollers were also sold in Canada, and about 10,300 more were sold in Mexico, the federal agency said. Graco said its recall is voluntary. ""Over the past 60 years, safety has been and will continue to be the priority at Graco,"" the firm said on its website. ""As part of our continuous effort to provide quality and safe products, Graco identified that select stroller models, including some of our LiteRider models that were sold before the updated hinge was available, have folding hinges that could in rare circumstances have the potential to pinch a child's finger, posing a laceration or amputation hazard."" The recalled models are Aspen, Breeze, Capri, Cirrus, Glider, Kite, LiteRider, Sierra, Solara, Sterling and TravelMate model strollers and travel systems. The models bear a manufacture date from August 1, 2000, to September 25, 2014, and were sold at Target, Toys R Us, Walmart and other retail stores nationwide and online. The prices were $40 to $70 for the strollers and $140 to $170 for the travel systems.","Graco Children's Products receives 11 reports of fingertip amputations, other injuries .

"It used to be as plain as a beer-foam mustache. Portland, Oregon, has more breweries and brewpubs than any other place -- in the sixties now -- ergo, it's the world's greatest beer city. And none of those breweries makes swill. But the world is changing for the better -- and catching up to a movement pioneered by Portlanders. Craft beer is worldwide now and other cities nip at our Birkenshod heels in the crucial best-beer-city-in-the-world race. Denver and San Diego are contenders without a doubt. Milwaukee. Brooklyn. Various Asian capitals -- Beijing, Bangkok, Tokyo -- all have thriving beer scenes. Berlin, where Stone Brewing is building a big beer hall and brewery. England, where craft breweries are sprouting even as traditional Brit pubs close weekly. Prague, of course, where golden lager was born. Dublin indubitably. Even Asheville, North Carolina, which rather noisily voted itself Beer City USA a few years back, is now in the running for real with an impressive roster of local breweries and big new production breweries built by New Belgium, Oskar Blues and Sierra Nevada. Bless 'em all, for the rising tide of craft beer floats all boats, and we Portlanders welcome the company. As long as all acknowledge that there's just one best beer city in the world: Portland, aka Beervana. Here are 23 reasons, a number you'll recognize as a prime, of which there are an infinite number. Which is really big. Almost like being the best beer city in the world. 1. According to supermarket tracking services, Portland leads the United States in percentage of craft beer sales with nearly 40% of beer purchases being craft beer. 2. Oregon breweries brewed 53% of all the draft beer served in the state. 3. We keep finding new places to serve beer, such as growler-fill stations, which have opened in major grocery stores, as stand-alone establishments and in a Southeast Portland mini-mart that anywhere else would sell fried chicken and half-racks of Milwaukee's Best. 4. Speaking of growlers (large, re-fillable bottles that allow you to take large amounts of freshly tapped beer to go), the Portland-designed, Steampunk-styled uKeg keeps beer cold and carbonated and people love the idea: Growlerwerks LLC hoped to raise $75,000 in its Kickstarter campaign and so far nearly 5,000 people have donated $665,000 -- with about three weeks to go. 5. It's hard to imagine the critical mass of more than 60 brewing establishments in a town. In close-in Southeast Portland, a dozen breweries and brewpubs populate just a few square blocks. Toss in pubs such as the Basement, Apex, White Owl Social Club, Blitz and the BeerMongers, and you have a walking beer tour that could fill a couple of days. 6. If you don't want to walk, there are several beer-tour companies including Brewvana beer bus tours (with Japanese-language tours, as well) and the u-pedal aerobics of Pedalounge, which is a sort of 12-person pedal-powered bar with stools and an awning, except you can't drink on the road. 7. We have the biggest outdoor beer party on the continent, July's Oregon Brewers Festival, which attracts more than 85,000 people a year -- many of whom are out-of-state or international beer tourists -- to its five-day run at Tom McCall Waterfront Park. 8. Missed the OBF? No problem. Beer festivals happen year' round in Portland, such as December's Holiday Ale Festival, when thousands of big-beer fans drink can't-find-'em-anywhere-else winter beers in large, heated tents in Portland's Pioneer Courthouse Square. It's a rare day in Beervana without a beer event, thanks to great bottle shops such as Belmont Station, BeerMongers, By The Bottle, Imperial Bottle Shop and Taproom and others that organize a couple hundred beer releases, meet-the-brewer events, tap takeovers and the like every year. There are also brewers dinners, beer tastings and Roscoe's monthly beer summits. Nobody's done an official festival count, but Portland hosts more than a hundred a year, including specialized events such as an organic beer festival, a fruit beer festival, Peche Fest (only peach beers and ciders on tap) and Biketobeer Fest. 9. Portland is the site of the national 2015 Craft Brewers Conference. Can thousands of brewers and industry types be wrong? 10. Portland created the fresh-hop beer category, when brewers trek to local hop farms for just-picked hops and make special beers. Oregon celebrates its hop bounty with several fresh-hop beer festivals every fall, and pubs such as the Lucky Labrador Brewing Company hold hop-picking parties harvesting backyard hop plants. 11. Portland has a dedicated gluten-free brewery, Ground Breaker, where no barley malt nor wheat shall ever tread. They brew a variety of G-F beers with roasted chestnuts and the like. Nationally distributed Omission is also brewed in Portland, with traditional ingredients and a special process to remove gluten. 12. Anything qualifies as an excuse to pour special beers: recently opened Baerlic Brewing celebrated the life of Evel Knievel one night and Ecliptic Brewing, owned by longtime Oregon brewer (and avid astronomer) John Harris, opened its first-anniversary week with an eclipse-viewing party on an overcast Thursday. (The clouds did open briefly.) 13. In 2010 Mike Wright opened a one-barrel nanobrewery called Beetje in his Southeast Portland garage. In late 2011 he took the plunge and opened The Commons Brewery in a commercial space with employees, a tasting room and a seven-barrel system brewing farmhouse ales. At the end of this year, he's moving to a space three times as big and adding a 15-barrel brewhouse. Who says you have to brew an IPA to make it in this town? 14. But it doesn't hurt: BridgePort IPA is the beer that made Portland an IPA town 20 years ago, and is still a great beer and the brewery's flagship, though its 60- bitterness units of hoppiness is a modest number these days. 15. As part of marriage preparations, some Portland couples brew their wedding beers with pro brewer Jay Webb at Portland U-Brew & Pub. 16. Homebrewing is big in Portland with a number of homebrewers clubs and a dozen or more homebrew supply shops in the area, including America's oldest homebrew shop, F.H. Steinbart, founded in 1918. Plus, Widmer's Collaborator program brews homebrewers' winning recipes on a commercial scale, giving Oregonians beers that'd otherwise never make it to market and donating part of the profit to an Oregon Brew Crew scholarship fund. 17. Ben Edmunds and his brew crew at Breakside Brewing set a goal of brewing 100 different beers in 2013 and they made it, brewing everything from Apizza Alt to Old Woody. 18. Two Portland breweries -- Widmer Brothers Brewing and BridgePort -- celebrate 30th anniversaries this year. Widmer celebrated with 30 Beers for 30 Years -- reprising beers from its brewing history such as 1994's Ur-Alt. 19. Being a sports fan doesn't mean settling for an industrial lager. There are no fewer than four places to get Portland-brewed beers at a Trail Blazers NBA home game; Widmer and Lompoc Brewing each make special beers for the Portland Timbers soccer team and BridgePort brews a special beer for the Hillsboro Hops minor league baseball team. 20. Portland breweries and brewpubs continue to evolve into interesting new shapes, such as Ex Novo Brewing Company, a nonprofit brewery that donates part of its revenue to selected causes. BTU Brasserie is a fine new Chinese restaurant/brewery where you can get smoked duck moo shu and house-brewed rice lager. 21. Nearly everybody barrel-ages and brews sour beers these days, thanks to Oregon pioneers such as Alan Sprints of Hair of the Dog Brewing and Deschutes Brewery. 22. Mike and Brian McMenamin helped create Oregon's pivotal brewpub law of 1985 and have since built a quirky empire of nearly 60 pubs, breweries and hotels, each different and artist-decorated. Along the way, they've saved dozens of historic buildings such as the Crystal Ballroom and Edgefield, and have contributed mightily to Oregon's thriving beer culture. 23. Nearby is an expanding universe of  other great Oregon beer towns, including Bend, Eugene, Hood River, Corvallis, Astoria, Ashland, Baker City and more. Fortunately, there's an infinite supply of prime numbers ... Is Portland the world's best beer city? Got another pick?

"In a global economy, the benchmark for educational success is no longer improvement by national standards alone, but the best performing school systems internationally. Results from the latest PISA assessment, the world's metric for evaluating learning outcomes at school, show amazing changes in the composition of the global talent pool. Shanghai, already the top-performing education system in 2009, has extended its lead in students' math performance over the next highest performer, Singapore, to the equivalent of a full school year. And that was at a time when Singapore, too, saw rapid progress. Other East Asian systems, including Chinese Taipei and Japan, also saw improved student learning outcomes. PISA -- the Programme for International Student Assessment -- was conducted in 2012, a year when many of the 65 participating countries were grappling with the aftermath of an economic crisis that has brought home the urgency of equipping more people with better skills to collaborate, compete and connect in ways that drive economies forward. Some contend that Shanghai's success in PISA just reflects rote learning and immense drilling for tests. But the most impressive performance of Shanghai's students is actually not on the tasks that ask them to simply reproduce what they have learned, but on tasks where they need to extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge creatively in novel situations. Data on other Chinese provinces and cities is not yet published by PISA because not enough regions take part in the tests to be considered representative.  However, China as a whole is expected to  be included in the 2015 assessment. Google knows everything . Consider this: Only 2% of American students can conceptualize, generalize and use advanced math in creative ways, which is what the highest performance level in PISA requires. In Shanghai it is over 30%. Shanghai has understood that the world economy will pay an ever-rising premium on excellence, and that today's economy no longer rewards people simply for what they know -- Google already knows everything-- but for what they can do with what they know. Others have explained Shanghai's high performance with the exclusion of disadvantaged internal immigrants from the comparisons. But immigrants have always been part of Shanghai's PISA tests and most East Asian school systems excel precisely because they are capable to leverage the academic potential of disadvantaged students much better than many Western nations do, and because they are able to break the downward spiral between disadvantage, lower performance and lower levels of student engagement. Making the grade in China: Grueling college exams . They have devised powerful strategies to attract the most talented teachers to the most challenging classrooms and to get the strongest principals into the toughest schools. While the American dream of social mobility is becoming a distant memory for the next generation of American students, it is just emerging as a new reality in East Asia. Obviously, one can't copy and paste school systems wholesale. But PISA has revealed a surprising number of features which the world's most successful school systems share and from which others can learn. For a start, leaders in the East Asian education systems have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education, their future, more than consumption today. But placing a high value on education is just part of their equation. Hard work vs. talent . Another part is the belief in the possibilities for all children to achieve. In Japan, for example, students not only believe they are in control of their ability to succeed, but they are prepared to do what it takes to do so: 84% of students said they won't put off difficult problems, in the U.S. only half did so. The fact that students in most Asian countries consistently believe that achievement is mainly a product of hard work, rather than inherited intelligence, suggests that education and its social context can make a difference in instilling values that foster success in education. In the past different students were taught in similar ways. Shanghai embraces diversity with differentiated instructional practices, its teachers have high expectations for every student and realize that ordinary students have extraordinary talents. They also share clear and ambitious standards across the board. Everyone knows what is required to get a given qualification. Teachers matter . And nowhere does the quality of a school system exceed the quality of its teachers. The East Asian school systems all pay great attention to how they select and train their staff. And when deciding where to invest, they prioritize the quality of teachers over the size of classes. Not least, they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow in their careers. High performers have also moved on from bureaucratic control and accountability to professional forms of work organization. They support their teachers to make innovations in pedagogy, to improve their own performance and that of their colleagues, and to pursue professional development that leads to stronger educational practice. The goal of the past was standardization and compliance, top performers enable teachers to be inventive. In the past, the policy focus was on the provision of education, in top school systems it's on outcomes, shifting from looking upwards in the bureaucracy towards looking outwards to the next teacher, the next school, about creating networks of innovation. You can see that nowhere better than in Finland and Japan. The most impressive outcome of world class school systems is perhaps that they deliver high quality across the entire school system so that every student benefits from excellent learning. And they align policies and practices effectively across all aspects of the system, they make them coherent over sustained periods of time, and they see that they are consistently implemented. You can see that nowhere better than in Singapore . Room for improvement . And yet, there are areas where Shanghai, too, has room for improvement. Intrinsic motivation is often low, for example, only 36% of students in Shanghai say they like to solve complex problems. Just 75% say that school has taught them things which could be useful in a job, compared with an OECD average of 87%. There are also indications that Shanghai's schools can improve the social climate for learning: Just two-thirds of Shanghai's 15-year-olds feel they belong at school. On average across OECD countries it is over 80%, and in some countries over 90%. Not least, just 77% of students in Shanghai say that other students like them, compared with an average of 90%. The challenges are tough and the status quo has many protectors. But global comparisons like PISA remind us of what is possible in education. And they help us to set meaningful targets in terms of measurable goals achieved by the world's educational leaders. The world has become indifferent to tradition and past reputations, unforgiving of frailty and ignorant of custom or practice. Success will go to those individuals, institutions and countries which are swift to adapt, slow to complain and open to change. And the task for governments is to ensure that their citizens and education systems rise to this challenge.","Shanghai and other East Asian education systems top OECD's international ranking .

"Metro-North Railroad, the second largest commuter rail line in the country, has a ""deficient safety culture"" and overemphasizes on-time performance, according to a report released Friday by the Federal Railroad Administration. The review, which comes after a 60-day safety assessment by the U.S. Department of Transportation's rail agency, said  the focus on punctuality ""has had a detrimental effect on safety, adversely affecting the inspection and maintenance of track and negatively impacting train operations."" Metro-North employees have reported feeling pressure to rush when responding to technical issues or needing more time to make necessary track repairs, according to the report. ""Currently, no single department or office, including the Safety Department, proactively advocates for safety"" at the railroad, and there is no effort to identify or take accountability for safety concerns, the reviews said. Joseph Giulietti, who took over for former Metro-North president Howard Permut in January, responded to the report at Grand Central Terminal on Friday. ""Safety was not the top priority. It must be, and it will be,"" Giulietti said. ""I have a clear message for our customers and our employees: Safety must come first at Metro-North. I will not allow any Metro-North trains to run unless I'm confident that they will run safely,"" he added. In the report, the Federal Railroad Administration said Metro-North has a poor training and record-keeping system. With 700 new employees hired in 2013, an effective training program for new and existing employees is critical for safe operations, according to  the assessment. ""The emphasis on on-time performance, combined with the increased volume of train activity, appears to have led managers and supervisors to allow inspections, maintenance and employee training to lapse,"" the federal inquiry concluded. Metro-North has 60 days to submit a plan to improve the training program and the effectiveness of its safety department, according to the review. The three-month review was prompted by a derailment on December 1, 2013. A Metro-North train of seven cars derailed while traveling from Poughkeepsie, New York, to Grand Central Terminal in New York City. The train was hurtling along at 82 mph, far over the speed limit of 30 mph for that section of track, as it approached a sharp bend in the Bronx. The cars tumbled off the track, killing four passengers and leaving dozens more hospitalized. The lead car came to rest inches from water at the intersection of the Hudson and Harlem rivers. ""We at Metro-North are heartbroken at the loss of life that has occurred on this railroad,"" Giulietti said, adding that Metro-North plans to create a confidential close-call reporting system for employees to report safety issues. Giulietti said that Metro-North officials also have plans to make personnel changes, to buy new equipment and install cameras inside the agency's trains. ""We have a lot of work ahead of us. But every problem I've seen here can be fixed -- and will be fixed,"" he said. The December derailment was the fourth serious accident on the railroad since May 2013. In June, a Metro-North train was sent down a track closed for construction and fatally struck a foreman. In another incident, a Metro-North train derailed and was struck by a train on an adjacent track. More needs to be done immediately to improve safety, said Federal Railroad Administration chief Joseph Szabo in a letter to the head of New York's transportation authority after the derailment. ""Safety is our top priority, and this in-depth assessment should serve as a wake-up call to Metro-North as they work to make their operations safer,"" said U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx.  ""Efficiency and on-time performance are important, but they cannot come before the safety of every passenger on board or those communities along the system.""","Federal review says Metro-North places ""overemphasis"" on punctuality before safety .

"On Sunday, all contact with AirAsia Flight 8501 was lost over the Java Sea as a wide area of thunderstorms covered the area. The discovery of floating debris on Tuesday about 100 miles from its last known position, in combination with an analysis of ocean currents, will give investigators clues where to search for the remainder of the aircraft. From its cruise altitude, the airplane's gliding distance would also be about 100 miles, but consider that for the debris to drift that same 100 miles it would only take a drift rate of 2 knots, yielding a wide range of possibilities as to the nature of the aircraft's descent to the water below. Many parallels between AirAsia 8501 and Air France 447 in June 2009 are obvious. Both aircraft were lost in thunderstorm areas of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Both crashed at sea where floating debris drifted for days from the point of contact with the sea before being discovered,  and both were sophisticated fly-by-wire Airbus aircraft (though different models). While flying into a thunderstorm is always to be avoided, it was not likely the sole cause of the accident. The reported requests by the crew to deviate course and change altitude seeking to avoided thunderstorm cells and turbulence are completely normal. The weather in the ITCZ has some unique qualities compared to your average thunderstorm over land. The storms are driven by the convergence of airflow patterns between the northern and southern hemispheres of the Earth, in addition to the usual factors of warm moist air and unstable atmospheric conditions. The height of the stratosphere --- which tends to put a cap on the height of thunderstorm growth -- averages about 35,000 feet over the mid latitudes (such as that of mainland USA), but reaches to 50,000 feet or more in the ITCZ, providing for the growth of thunderstorms to great heights and accompanying intensity. These features can lead to some unusual conditions such as icing or heavy rain within those storms where it may not normally be expected, as was the case with AF 447 when its airspeed-sensing probes became clogged. In the aftermath of the Air France crash, in addition to an improved design of the probes, significant emphasis has been placed on pilot training on the prevention and recovery from similar scenarios -- such as loss of airspeed indications and high altitude stall recovery. I would say all pilots, especially of Airbus aircraft, would be aware of AF447's lessons, including QZ8501's captain, given his reported experience. There is a recent development however that relates to Airbus A320 series aircraft. A December 10, 2014, Airworthiness Directive (AD 2014-25-51) describes how control of the aircraft could be lost in flight as a consequence of icing of the angle-of-attack probes and an interaction with the airplane's stall protection function. Those probes act like small weather vanes on the side of the aircraft and measure the angle at which the airplane moves through the air -- the angle of attack. If the angle is too high the air can no longer flow smoothly around the wings, resulting in an aerodynamic stall. The acceptable range of angles of attack is fairly small, and gets considerably smaller at higher speeds, such as cruise speed. Simply put, depending on the position of the angle-of-attack probes when freezing occurs and the subsequent speed of the aircraft, the system may be fooled into thinking that the aircraft is approaching a stalled condition -- even when it isn't. In response, the airplane's stall protections pitch the aircraft's nose down to recover. This erroneous pitch down cannot be overridden by the pilots unless an emergency procedure in the Airworthiness Directive is followed. All pilots flying this model airplane should be aware of this. The procedure instructs the pilots to shut down two of the three air data computers to render the usual stall protection inoperative and allow recovery of the aircraft. Of course, there is no way, at this stage of the investigation, to know if this played a part, but investigators will certainly be looking for evidence of this phenomenon. Another obvious question is the apparent lack of transmitted position and altitude data after its last known position in cruise. This data is transmitted throughout the flight by a system known as ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast). This system transmits the airplane's position and other basic data to ground stations. Though its position is GPS-satellite derived, it is not transmitted to satellites, only to ground stations -- so the range to the nearest receiving ground station is a factor in the availability of that data. The apparent sudden loss of this data at cruise could be explained by failures in flight such as an electrical failure, in-flight breakup of the aircraft, or the pilots switching off required data to operate the system such as that outlined in the emergency procedure above. However, it could also be that the aircraft simply flew out of range of the ground stations. Flight tracking websites indicate that this routinely occurs in the general area where QZ8501's last ADS-B transmission was made. I think that is the most likely cause of the end of the data stream and is not necessarily an indication of catastrophic failure in flight. In the case of Air France 447, the aircraft came down in the Atlantic Ocean where the sea depth exceeded 12,000 feet. While some floating wreckage and a number of bodies were discovered within a few days on the surface, the extreme depth and rough terrain on the ocean bottom delayed discovery of the remainder of the aircraft and recovery of the flight recorders for two years. Fortunately, the 100-foot depth of the Java Sea in the area where evidence of QZ8501 was found will almost certainly result in the relatively rapid location of the aircraft and recovery of the two flight recorders. Consideration of ocean currents during the two days between the aircraft's disappearance and the discovery of floating debris will help lead investigators to find the remainder of the aircraft and its passengers. We should not be subjected to long period of uncertainty such as with AF447 -- or the continuing lack of information on MH370. While any accident investigation will take months to complete, I would expect more information to be available as the search and recovery continues. Clues from the way in which airplane parts were damaged on impact and the flight data and voice recorder contents will provide answers. But like any aircraft accident, the cause is likely to be the result of a chain of events and conditions, the absence of any one of which would have avoided this tragic accident. At this time, we can only guess what some of those events and conditions are.","Bill Palmer: AirAsia crash bears similarities in terms of weather, other factors, to AF447 .

"(CNN)Ah, um, that referee at the college football national championship sure looked familiar -- but no, it wasn't Bob Newhart.

"(CNN)In a national title game where most of the pregame focus was on the starting quarterbacks, it was a determined running back who was the star. Ohio State sophomore tailback Ezekiel Elliott continued his record-setting running with 246 yards and four touchdowns as the Buckeyes rolled to a 42-20 victory over Oregon in the inaugural College Football Playoff national championship on Monday. It was the third consecutive game in which Elliott ran for more than 200 yards. After a record 220 in the Big Ten championship in December and a record 230 in the Sugar Bowl on New Year's Day, he set a mark for the national title contest (including the BCS title games) by making Oregon use multiple players to bring him down. And even that didn't always work. At a school that produced the only two-time Heisman Trophy winner -- Archie Griffin -- and many other star running backs like Keith Byars and Eddie George, only Elliott has rushed for 200+ yards in back-to-back-to-back games. ""We knew (coming into the game) that our O-line was bigger and more physical than their D-line, and we just had to punch them in the mouth,"" he said, referring to his blockers. ""The line came out and played their butts off. They paved the way for me."" Oregon vs. Ohio State: Score, Reaction from 2015 College Football Championship . He told CNN's Rachel Nichols all he had to do was to run through the holes his line opened and break a couple of tackles. ""I give all the credit to my boys,"" he said. ""I knew that we were going to be unstoppable."" Oregon head coach Mark Helfrich gave Elliott credit but also pointed to the big guys who blocked for him. ""He is an exceptional player as is their offensive line,"" Helfrich told reporters. ""A lot of credit to (all) those guys."" Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer, who became the second coach to win national titles at multiple schools, said Elliott is the most underrated running back in the country. ""He's one of the best post-contact yard guys I have ever been around,"" he said. The quarterback duel between Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota of Oregon and Cardale Jones, who only became Ohio State's starter in their 13th game of the season due to an injury, was a bit of a stalemate. Mariota had more passing yards (333) and two TD passes to one for Jones, but the Ohio State quarterback also helped steady his team, particularly in the first half, with some key runs. His receivers struggled to get open early but the young Buckeyes' offensive line eventually overpowered their Ducks' defensive counterparts as the game wore on and Oregon wore down. That meant open holes for Elliott to exploit and time for Jones to throw. Ohio State (14-1) overcame four turnovers, including two mistakes that led to 10 points in the second half as Oregon (13-2) closed an 11-point halftime deficit to just one. But Oregon couldn't stop Elliott, who carried the ball 36 times. Meyer said he would never have imagined after spring practice that his team would have been in the national title game. ""But I didn't quite understand the improvement these guys could make,"" he said, also thinking back to early in the season when Ohio State was embarrassed by a home loss to a Virginia Tech team that ended up in the Military Bowl. Mariota, who would likely be a top pick in the NFL Draft should he choose to leave school early, said he was going to take a ""couple of days"" to make a decision on whether to stay. ""Obviously (losing) hurts, (and) I'm sure it'll weigh in a little bit but there's a lot of other things that have to play into that decision,"" he said. ""There's a lot of other things that could bring me back and not just this loss.""

"More than 1,500 people have been evacuated after a volcano in western Nicaragua erupted Saturday, shooting gas and ash 2 1/2 miles into the sky, government officials said. Explosions at San Cristobal Volcano -- located in the department of Chinandega about 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of the Honduran border and 130 kilometers north of the capital, Managua -- began around 8:45 a.m. Saturday, according to an assessment from SINAPRED, Nicaragua's federal emergency and disaster management agency. ""We have to be careful and take all appropriate measures for the families that are there and families from neighboring towns,"" first lady Rosario Murillo told the EL19 government-run newspaper. She said 400 families have been moved. Are you there? Share your images and videos. ""I have seen it bring ashes, but not like now,"" Jose Espinoza, who lives near the volcano, said. ""It surprised us because it is a powerful volcano and to see it like this would make anyone panic."" Jacinta Carazo, another resident, told CNN that an eruption in 2006 brought a lot of mud but this one was mostly ash. ""It got dark,"" she said. Neither Espinoza nor Carazo has evacuated nor do they want to leave. A story linked off Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's website indicated 20,000 people in surrounding towns could be affected. About 3,000 people in five communities were already seeing gases and other effects after three large explosions on Saturday, SINAPRED director Guillermo Gonzalez said, according to the El Pueblo Presidente website. Authorities say the main risk is the mix of rain, ash and gas that could affect the health of residents. School classes have been suspended in Chinandega department through Sunday, education official Jose Tremino said. At about 1,745 meters (5,725 feet), San Cristobal is Nicaragua's tallest volcano, and is part of a complex consisting of five volcanic edifices, according to the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History.

"Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is the face of his country's regime, but his family members are also believed to wield a powerful influence on issues facing the country. In the past year, as pressure on the regime increased, al-Assad's inner circle has become more of a family affair, said David Lesch, a professor of Middle East history and author of ""The New Lion of Damascus: Bashar al-Assad and Modern Syria."" ""That's part of what Bashar has been doing ever since he came to power,"" Lesch said. ""He has put members of his extended family ... in various parts of government and military security apparatus. If the day came -- and it did come -- where there was a threat to the regime, he could count on the loyalty of those closest to him."" Here is a closer look at the al-Assad family, an authoritarian dynasty that has been in place for more than 40 years. The matriarchAnisa Makhlouf al-Assad . Bashar's mother, Anisa, was married to Hafez Assad, Bashar's father and predecessor, who died in 2000. The Makhlouf family gained wealth and status through Anisa's marriage to Hafez, taking on contracts in key industries, among them telecommunications, banking and oil. Anisa's nephew, Rami, is regarded as Syria's wealthiest man, worth some $5 billion. Anisa is said to be an influential figure within the regime despite keeping an extremely low profile over the years (she was not even seen during coverage of her husband's funeral). Syrian writer Ayman Abdel Nour, who went to college with Bashar, says there was distance between Bashar and his father and that Anisa was ""the mother and father and mentor of the family."" The first ladyAsma Akhras al-Assad . Asma al-Assad is the Syrian-British wife of the president. Born to a cardiologist father and a diplomat mother, she grew up in London, where she was known by friends and classmates as ""Emma."" Asma graduated from King's College in London with a degree in computer science. She worked for JP Morgan as an investment banker before marrying Bashar in 2000, six months after he became president. Her influence remains unclear. Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert who knew Asma al-Assad and worked with her told CNN: ""No one can say what's happening behind closed palace doors, but I doubt she feels she has any control or would ultimately have much influence over what her husband is doing."" The last major profile of her was by Vogue in spring 2011; however, a cache of emails recently leaked to CNN shed deep light on the first lady's personal life over the past year, amidst the civilian uprisings taking place in her country. One e-mail features an apparent request to a friend for the latest ""Harry Potter"" DVD. Another series of e-mails features exchanges about shopping for high-end jewelry, furniture and art. (More about Asma al-Assad) The younger brotherMaher al-Assad . Maher al-Assad is Bashar's youngest brother and considered by many to be the second most powerful man in Syria. He oversees two of the Syrian army's strongest units: the Republican Guard, which protects the regime in Damascus, and the elite Fourth Armored Division, which suppressed the early uprisings in the southern part of Syria. A hard-liner with a reputation for being cruel and moody, according to television channel France 24, Maher allegedly shot his brother-in-law, Asef Shawkat, in the stomach during an argument in the presidential palace in 1999. A New York Times profile on Maher reports that many Syrians who know him say he has a sharp intellect as well as a harsh and ruthless nature. He has apparently attempted to restructure Syria's military and intelligence so that both entities reflect his persona. The older sisterBushra al-Assad . Bushra al-Assad is the eldest of al-Assad's five siblings. A pharmacist by training, she is said to be very intelligent. She also had a close relationship with her late father. Described by one insider as ""ruthless,"" Bushra, like her mother, brandishes influence in the Assad inner sanctum and stays out of the public eye. A profile of Bushra in Mideast Monitor said although ""she shuns the spotlight, her behind-the-scenes political influence has been decisive at times."" There have been reports of tension between Bushra and her sister-in-law Asma. Bushra is said to disapprove of Asma's public appearances in Syrian society, according to French newspaper Le Monde. In 1995, Bushra married Asef Shawkat, a military officer 10 years older and a divorced father of five. Despite her family's staunch objections to the union -- her brother Maher apparently had Asef imprisoned on several occasions to keep them apart -- they eventually accepted Asef into their circle, where he was appointed head of the army's intelligence services for a time. Bushra has four children, all named after members of her family: Bushra, Maher, Basel and Anisa. The brother-in-lawAsef Shawkat . Shawkat was once in charge of the army's intelligence services, eventually becoming deputy chief-of-staff of Syria's armed forces. He is said to be one of Bashar's close allies, although there are reports that he was demoted after Hezbollah military commander Imad Mugniyeh was assassinated in Damascus in 2008. According to Mideast Monitor, Shawkat and Maher were once locked in a power struggle over who had the ear of the president. Bushra is said to have interceded, easing tensions and resolving the dispute. [Update: July 18, 2012] Shawkat was killed in a blast at a national security building in Damascus during a meeting of ministers and security officials, state TV reported. The lost brothersBasel al-AssadMajd al-Assad . Not much is known about the president's brother Majd, who in 2009 died from ""a long illness"" at age 43, according to Syria's official news agency SANA. Majd, like many other members of his family, remained out of the public eye. Basel al-Assad was 31 years old when he died in a 1994 car accident, crashing his Mercedes on a city highway in Damascus. Known to have been charismatic and outgoing, Basel was older than Bashar and groomed to be his father's heir apparent, according to The Guardian. Upon news of his brother's death, Bashar was brought back to Damascus to undergo military training to eventually take his brother's place as successor to their father's role as president. At the time, Bashar was studying ophthalmology in London.","Behind the scenes, the relatives of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad hold significant influence .

"(CNN)He's an unemployed former English Premier League footballer who is desperate to resume his playing career. But while several clubs have signaled their interest in offering convicted rapist Ched Evans a second chance, public opinion in Britain is proving an almost insurmountable stumbling block for the 26-year-old. Since his release from prison after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl, debate has raged as to whether Evans should be allowed to resurrect a high-profile career within the sport. Even the leader of the British Labour Party -- the UK's main opposition political group -- has weighed into the debate, asking whether a sporting role model should be offered a contract by a club. After being spurned by former club Sheffield United, fourth tier Oldham Athletic is the latest to be thrust into an unwanted spotlight after contemplating hiring him. More than 27,000 people have put their names to a petition calling on the club not to sign him in the space of 24 hours, with Oldham forced into a series of crisis meetings to further examine the issues. The club released a statement on Monday saying it still hadn't reached a decision and would ""continue to have conversations with representative bodies ... and will conduct due diligence with regard to any decision we make on this matter."" Evans, who started his career with current English Premier League champions Manchester City, has maintained his innocence throughout and is awaiting the outcome of a Criminal Cases Review Commission inquiry into his sentence. But his future in the game could hang on the outcome of Oldham's investigations. Should they turn him down, the former Wales international would be further away from the playing field than ever. Oldham might be in two minds, but public and political opinion, appears not to be. The leader of the Labour party, Ed Miliband, the local Member of Parliament for Oldham East and Saddleworth, Debbie Abrahams, and Greater Manchester's Police and Crime Commissioner, Tony Lloyd have all come out against the move. ""I believe it would be wrong for Ched Evans to return to playing football for Oldham Athletic or any other club, as he has been convicted of rape, a violent crime for which he has neither apologized or acknowledged,"" Abrahams said in a statement. ""It would send out an entirely inappropriate message to young fans and victims of sex crimes for him to be signed by Oldham or anyone."" It's very much a case of history repeating itself for Evans. Clamor from the public derailed a plan for him to be allowed to train with Sheffield United, in English soccer's third tier, after the club said reaction to its decision ""has been at an intensity that could not have been anticipated."" Over 165,000 people signed a petition urging United to cut ties with him while Olympic heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis-Hill told the club she wanted her name removed from one of the stands at its stadium should Evans play for it again. Her decision drew praise from the British Prime Minister David Cameron, who said he ""understood"" why one of the stars of 2012's Olympic Games opposed Evans' return to her local club. Evans' official website states his belief that his conviction was a ""gross miscarriage of justice"" and underlines his commitment to quashing the verdict. It is this standpoint, allied to the perceived prestige and financial rewards that come with being a professional footballer that has helped fuel such a fevered response to Evans' place in the game, according to lawyer and Football Association agent Shehneela Ahmed. ""A lot of the backlash has been over the fact that he's not accepted his guilt, despite having served his sentence,"" she told CNN shortly after his release. ""But where does it say that a convicted criminal, who has served their time, cannot go out to work? ""I think people are angry because normally a lot of the criminals who are sent to prison, once they've served their sentence in relation to a heinous crime, have to start from scratch trying to get employment. ""But this is a young lad who has committed a crime, never admitted his guilt, and despite that, he comes out of prison and walks into a job which is so well paid."" After being rebuffed by Sheffield United, the manager of lowly Hartlepool -- currently rock bottom of England's fourth tier -- expressed an interest in signing Evans. The town's Labour Member of Parliament, Iain Wright, labeled Evans a ""pariah"" during his call for Hartlepool to steer clear. And the club moved quickly to dismiss the speculation, saying it understood the concerns of its supporters and the general public. Maltese club Hibernians were another club to reportedly contemplate handing Evans a deal but that move was effectively ruled out when the UK's Ministry of Justice emphasized its laws on convicted sex offenders working abroad. ""We are determined to have one of the toughest regimes in the world for managing sex offenders, to stop them re-offending and to protect victims,"" it said in a statement. ""Probation officers must give permission for sex offenders on licence to take up new jobs and this includes ensuring they hold regular face to face meetings -- this effectively rules out working abroad."" As Evans adjusts to his new status as a footballing pariah, Oldham must feel a certain sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu. It signed Lee Hughes in 2007 after the striker had served three years in prison for being found guilty of causing the death of Douglas Graham through dangerous driving. The trial of Hughes, who once played in the Premier League for West Brom, heard how he crashed into another car carrying the father of four when traveling on the wrong side of the road and then fled the scene. Despite the furore, Hughes spent two seasons with Oldham before going on to represent three other league clubs. It isn't just football that has had to deal with the focus that comes with offenders being reintroduced to sport. Former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson returned to boxing after three years in jail for the rape of 18-year-old Desiree Washington, making millions in the process. Prior to Oldham's board prolonging its deliberations, one of its sponsors -- Verling Rainwater Solutions -- confirmed it would end its agreement with the club if they signed Evans. ""The club know our stance and that is if they sign or allow Ched Evans to train we will be out of the door,"" director Craig Verling was quoted as saying by the UK Press Association. The issue continued to be discussed at the highest levels of British politics, too. Labour leader Miliband told the BBC: ""I think that it is right Oldham are thinking again about whether Ched Evans should be hired by them because you are a role model, he's been convicted of a very serious crime. ""Personally, if I was in their shoes, he hasn't shown remorse and I wouldn't take him on."" Those sentiments were echoed by Greater Manchester's Police and Crime Commissioner Lloyd, who said: ""Ched Evans is a convicted rapist and, whilst I strongly believe in the principle of rehabilitation, it will send out entirely the wrong message if they offer him a contract. ""All offenders have the right to rebuild their lives and make amends after they have served their sentence, but Ched Evans' lack of remorse and failure to acknowledge his offense means it is simply inappropriate for him to be on a Greater Manchester football pitch week in and week out presenting himself as some kind of role model, especially to young people."" The only person from Oldham to speak on the matter on Monday was the team's manager Lee Johnson, who was besieged by cameras when he arrived at the club's stadium. ""It's a very difficult situation,"" he told reporters. ""I don't really want to comment. Of course we want what's best for the club -- whatever the board decides.""","Lower league Oldham deciding whether to sign Ched Evans .

"U.S. President Barack Obama phoned his Mexican counterpart Thursday to address the alarming trend of unaccompanied children entering the United States through Mexico. According to a White House statement, Obama told President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto that he ""welcomed the opportunity to work in close cooperation with Mexico to develop concrete proposals to address the root causes of unlawful migration from Central America."" The call came the day before Vice President Joe Biden heads to Guatemala for a meeting with regional leaders on the same topic. U.S. authorities estimate that between 60,000 and 80,000 children from Central America will cross the border this year without their parents. The magnitude of the deluge has forced the United States to turn three military bases into shelters. One of those, Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, will get a visit from Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson on Friday. Obama told PeÃ±a Nieto that he welcomed the Mexican President's ""efforts to target the criminals that lure families to send children,"" and reiterated to him that in all likelihood, those who make the dangerous and illegal journey would be sent back to Central America, according to the White House statement.","President Obama and Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto spoke by phone Thursday .

"Yuri Poznychenko has lived in the village of Stepanovka, close to Ukraine's border with Russia, all his life. Poznychenko, 67, was born a few years after the Red Army recaptured this land -- and the strategic hill of Saur Mogila nearby -- from Nazi forces. He is a stoic man, a farmer who knows endurance. But the events of the last few months reduce him to tears. On July 28, amid battles between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists for the area, a sniper from the Ukrainian National Guard shot dead Poznychenko's 36-year-old son as he tried to move his car to safety. ""They said they thought he was a separatist,"" he says, wiping his eyes. ""They apologized later, and a soldier helped bury him."" The inadequacy of the gesture goes unsaid. In June, when we last came here, Stepanovka was a neat village set in rolling farmland. Its people were poor but they had work and enough to eat. Now, as bitter winds blow in from the east, much of the village is in ruins. A decapitated Ukrainian tank sits astride the one road, electricity wires dangle in the wind, and 20 or more properties have been reduced to ruins, including Poznychenko's. He and his wife are the only members of their family left in Stepanovka. They have nowhere to go, no electricity and little food. Poznychenko says the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), now in complete control of this area, has promised to restore power, but there is no sign of the extensive work that will be needed. And in a few weeks' time, the temperature here will rarely stray above freezing. The wreckage of this year's battles is strewn around Stepanovka and many other villages in eastern Ukraine. The copper of spent bullets gleams in the wintry sun, sandbags sag over deserted trenches, and the husks of tanks and other military vehicles slowly turn from green to rust. And everywhere homes are reduced to piles of charred bricks. A fireplace stands incongruously in empty space; shattered windows creak on their hinges. Dogs left to fend for themselves wander through piles of garbage. The ceasefire agreed at the beginning of September only slowed the tempo of the fighting in eastern Ukraine, and sometimes barely that.  Huge volumes of ordnance have been spent in a stalemate at Donetsk airport, long a target of the rebels, where the control tower has been hit so many times it should no longer be standing. Further east, around the important crossroads and rail junction at Debaltseve, some thirty Ukrainian volunteers from the capital peer into the freezing mist. They occupy a slim finger of Ukrainian-held land, surrounded on three sides. Some of the men have been here for two months. Every day they are attacked, they say, but so far they have held the position and have built themselves underground shelters against the biting cold. But they don't have the resources or support to withstand a serious offensive. In the nearby town, a stream of laments: ""The young people have left; we are on our own""; ""The shelling is every day, by both sides."" And from one man shuffling past burned-out houses: ""I don't care which flag flies here; I just want peace."" Seventy-three-year-old Galina arrived in Debaltseve from her village when it came under fire, bringing only what she could carry. Looking down at her threadbare boots, she says she is so terrified of the shelling that she feels like her heart will jump from her body. She's too scared to eat or sleep. Peace seems unlikely as the ceasefire frays and the rhetoric gets ever more hostile. Ukraine appears to be in the throes of a vicious divorce. Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk says there will be no direct negotiations with the rebels, calling them Moscow's mercenaries. President Petro Poroshenko has ordered the withdrawal of all state services in ""occupied"" areas, which includes social welfare payments and state salaries for teachers and doctors. And Igor Plotnitsky, the self-declared Prime Minister of Luhansk -- the DPR's sister republic -- has challenged Poroshenko to a duel ""following the example of ancient Slavic chieftains and glorious Cossack atamans."" While the chest-beating goes on, Donetsk's neediest line up at the city's former circus to be registered for food handouts by a volunteer organization. They stand under posters of trapeze artists and lions to collect a big bag of groceries, but can only come here every two weeks. Most of these people are elderly; there are a few single mothers with anxious eyes and haggard faces. The food -- transported from beyond the DPR -- is provided by steel magnate Rinat Akhmetov, once the most powerful man in the Donbass but now in Kiev after falling out with the separatists and supporting Ukraine's unity. Long queues snake through Donetsk bus station as people try to leave the city. Many are trying to register themselves in government-held areas so they can get pension payments, but must make the sometimes perilous return journey every few weeks. Most can't afford to live anywhere else. There are no banks left open in the city and no cash machines working. Districts like Kyivski have been shelled so heavily they are reminiscent of the battle for Grozny, the Chechen capital, in the mid-1990s. In the bomb shelters to which many people retreat at night, outbreaks of skin diseases are reported among the children. The Donetsk People's Republic is promising its own system of payments to people here but is woefully short of the administrative skills needed to run a region nearly the size of Connecticut. It does however have its own souvenir mugs, and has symbolically adopted a different time zone from Kiev. There is a genuine animosity among people in Donbass toward the government in Kiev. The National Guard is widely hated; people accuse the army of random shelling. And the withdrawal of benefits and salaries on the cusp of winter has left many in despair. At the same time, people grumble about the inability of the DPR to help them, and lament its lack of basic organization. Some small protests have taken place in towns like Torez, close to where the Malaysian airliner was shot down in July. While Ukraine's divorce gets ever uglier, the ordinary people of the Donbass focus on survival, on a hand-to-mouth existence, without the means to escape the violence that has torn apart their lives for the last nine months. One of them, a fragile stooped woman who tells us she is 83, stands outside the last working Ukrainian bank in Donetsk, as others hammer on its door. Today it too will remain shuttered. ""I have no money,"" she says. ""I'll probably die because I have nothing to eat.""","The battle between the government and separatists for eastern Ukraine is taking its toll on the area's residents .

"Police Chief Thomas Jackson -- a central figure in the protests that flared in Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting of an unarmed black teen -- says he has no plans to step down despite mounting calls that he must go. Saying he ""intends to see this thing through,"" Jackson told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" on Thursday that he has been working with community leaders and others to create a dialogue in the community. ""Yes, I think I can see this through and come out on the other side with the community, the region and even the country a whole lot better,"" he said. Jackson's statements come as the grand jury is expected any day to deliver a decision on whether to indict a white police officer in the shooting death of Michael Brown. Law enforcement is girding itself for the possibility of more violent clashes like the ones that raged for days in the St. Louis suburb following the August 9 shooting. Brown's father calls for calm . Gov. Jay Nixon took authority from the Ferguson Police Department and gave it to state authorities in the days following Brown's shooting. Nixon said he put state troopers in charge because tension between law enforcement and demonstrators ""appeared to be at a flash point."" This week, ahead of the anticipated grand jury announcement, Nixon declared a state of emergency in Missouri and called up National Guard troops to play a backup role. Even so, Jackson said local police officers will be patrolling the streets. ""I'm running the response here locally,"" he said. That's unlikely to sit well with a large number of critics, who say the only answer is for Jackson to go. Criticism of the police chief has come from many directions -- Brown's family and friends, demonstrators, the U.S. Justice Department and members of the media -- over how his department handled the aftermath of Brown's shooting. Ferguson Police and St. Louis County law enforcement were widely criticized for being too heavy-handed in dealing with protesters and in how they interacted with media. Reporters said they were targeted for arrest or physical attacks from law enforcement for simply trying to do their job. How Ferguson became a global conversation . CNN reported in October that Jackson was bowing to pressure to step down. But since then, he has wavered multiple times and now wants to stay on longer, government sources familiar with the discussions told CNN on Thursday. The plan continues to be, according to the sources, for Jackson to be encouraged to step down for the good of the police department and the community. The conversations are part of a broader behind-the-scenes debate about how to tackle poor police relations within black communities in the St. Louis region. Some officials say one issue the Brown shooting has exposed is one faced by a number of small police departments -- less-experienced, lower-paid officers. Jackson told CNN that the ""pool of candidates is generally pretty small,"" and that a goal of the police department has been to work to hire and retain qualified officers. The police department currently has four black police officers, he said.","Police Chief Thomas Jackson believes he can weather the crisis .

"English Premier League champions Manchester United have rejected a bid for striker Wayne Rooney from rivals Chelsea. The West London club revealed in a statement released Wednesday that it has submitted a ""written offer"" for the unsettled striker. ""Chelsea Football Club can confirm that yesterday it made a written offer to Manchester United for the transfer of Wayne Rooney,"" the Chelsea statement read. The fee is not known, but reports in the UK media on Wednesday speculated that Chelsea might be offering winger Juan Mata or defender David Luiz plus cash in the return for the services of Rooney. But the club flatly reject the claim. ""Although the terms of the offer are confidential, for avoidance of doubt and contrary to what is currently being briefed to the press in Sydney (where Manchester United are currently on tour), the proposed purchase price does not include the transfer or loan of any players from Chelsea to Manchester United,"" the Chelsea statement read. Manchester United have not commented further on the bid. After overseeing his first game back in charge of Chelsea in Bangkok, Jose Mourinho described the offer as ""clean"" and ""ethical"" before adding that the club have not, and will not, bid for any other strikers this summer. ""We love the player, we are interested in the player, we made the bid. We have nothing more to say and nothing more to do. And now we have to respect and be ethical in this process,"" Mourinho said following Chelsea's 1-0 win over Singha All Stars. Chelsea's interest in Rooney is the latest twist in a long-running saga about the striker's future. Rumors of the 27-year-old's discontent began to surface towards the end of last season as Manchester United were romping to a 20th League title. The club eventually won by 11 points from rivals Manchester City, but Rooney was playing second fiddle to striker Robin van Persie who signed from Arsenal at the beginning of the 2012/13 season. The Dutchman netted 30 goals in 48 matches for his new club while Rooney only managed 12 from 37. At the end of last season, outgoing manager Alex Ferguson confirmed that Rooney had submitted a transfer request. ""We refused it. He should go away and think it over. He's not happy being taken off a couple of times this season, but Rooney in top form wouldn't have been taken off,"" Ferguson said following United's final home game of the season. Ferguson's replacement, David Moyes tried to quash ongoing rumors when he officially took over the managerial reigns at the club earlier this month. ""Wayne is not for sale,"" Moyes, who signed a six-year contract to replace Ferguson in May, told reporters. ""He is a Manchester United player and will remain a Manchester United player. ""I see a glint in his eye. He looks happy, he looks like he will knuckle down and get himself right."" That apparent glint has been replaced by a furrowed brow with Rooney reported to be ""angry and confused"" at his treatment by his current employers. The striker, who joined United from Moyes' previous club Everton for $39 million in 2004, signed a new improved five-year-deal in October 2010 following a similar falling out with the club's management. Manchester United's chief executive, Ed Woodward recently said that no contract renewals are currently being discussed. ""I am not sitting down with any player on an extension and there is no trigger date in the diary. Would we be afraid to run a contract down? Of course not,"" Woodward said.","Unsettled Man Utd striker subject of a ""written offer"" by West London club .

"Florida prosecutors will not charge George Zimmerman after a domestic dispute with his girlfriend last month, State Attorney Phil Archer said Wednesday. The decision not to pursue the case comes days after Zimmerman's girlfriend, Samantha Scheibe, said in a court document that she didn't want him to be charged. ""Upon reviewing the recent affidavit of the Ms. Scheibe and taking into account the conflicting statements about what occurred, the failure to cooperate with the ongoing investigation, and a lack of any other corroborating evidence or witnesses, there is no reasonable likelihood of successful prosecution,"" Archer said in a written statement. Zimmerman's lawyer praised the move. ""On behalf of George Zimmerman, I am pleased that I was able to present credible evidence to reasonable prosecutors who took the time to listen and that justice prevailed,"" attorney Jayne Weintraub said in a written statement. ""This demonstrates how great our system is."" Zimmerman was arrested on November 18 at Scheibe's Apopka, Florida, home after the two had a heated fight. According to a sheriff's office report about the incident, Scheibe said that after an argument, Zimmerman broke a table with a shotgun and then pointed it at her ""for a minute."" Authorities said he was arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault and misdemeanor counts of domestic violence battery and criminal mischief -- accusations that Zimmerman denied. ""I believe that the police misinterpreted me and that I may have misspoken about certain facts in my statement to the police,"" Scheibe said in a signed affidavit this week. ""I do not feel that the arrest report accurately recounts what happened."" Authorities had probable cause to arrest Zimmerman last month, Archer said. The Seminole County Sheriff's Office, he said, ""as usual, did a thorough and highly professional job of investigating this case."" In the court document filed this week, Scheibe accuses authorities of pressuring her. ""When I was being questioned by police, I felt very intimidated,"" she said. ""I was not allowed to call an attorney nor was I allowed to eat or drink anything for a very long time."" Heather Smith, a spokeswoman for the Seminole County Sheriff's Office, denied that claim. ""As you know, we provided media with the 911 call from Ms. Scheibe, which occurred prior to deputies responding,"" she said. ""Apparently, Ms. Scheibe may have misspoken about the facts of her interview as she had access to her phone and was provided with food."" Zimmerman's arrest in November came four months after the former neighborhood watch captain was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the death of teenager Trayvon Martin. The high-profile case sparked a heated nationwide discussion of race as well as debate over Florida's ""stand your ground"" law.","Zimmerman's lawyer: ""Justice prevailed""

"The Israeli military said Friday it arrested three Palestinians from the West Bank and charged them in an alleged plot to assassinate Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman. Court documents say the scheme involved a plan to purchase rocket-propelled grenades and fire them on his convoy.  Lieberman has a home in a West Bank settlement. The military suspects that the three men gathered intelligence on Lieberman's convoy. The indictment sheet says the plot was hatched in August during Operation Protective Edge -- an Israeli military assault against the Hamas military wing in Gaza, designed to stop Palestinian rocket attacks into Israel. A Hamas spokesman said he was unaware of a planned attack, but he justified it. All Israeli leaders are legitimate targets because Israeli soldiers killed Palestinian children and women, and they entered Al Aqsa mosque and attacked Palestinians, said Sami Abu Zuhri. The military and police said they also uncovered an intended gun and car attack on the Jewish West Bank settlement of Gush Etzion. Three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped there in June, contributing to tensions in the lead-up to the military action in Gaza.","Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman has a West Bank home .

"Tens of thousands of protesters converged on Mexico City on Thursday to vent their frustration and anger over the disappearance of 43 college students, presumed by many to be dead, and widespread political corruption. Students, union workers and supporters from around the country streamed into the Mexican capital's main square, known as the Zocalo, for a demonstration that had been largely peaceful before ending in pitched battles between riot police and groups of protesters throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails. Before these clashes, protesters marched into the square chanting ""Justice! Justice!"" They carried banners and hand-made posters featuring pictures of the students who disappeared at the end of September. One group burned a giant doll resembling President Enrique Pena Nieto, who has come under fire for what some saw as his slow reaction to the students' disappearance and for traveling abroad as protests spread across the country. Others waved Mexican flags painted black to mourn the mostly poor, rural Mexicans who have disappeared or been killed in recent years amid the country's drug violence. ""The problem isn't just the 43 students, it's the thousands more that disappeared before them,"" said a vendor from the state of Mexico who traveled to the capital by bus to participate in the march. ""We've ignored them for too long. We're not going to be quiet any longer."" The students, mostly young men in their 20s who been taking classes to become teachers at a rural school in the southern state of Guerrero, on September 26 had taken buses and vans to nearby Iguala for a protest. Local police blocked the highway leading into the city and shot at the students' vehicles, killing at least one student. Officers took the remaining students away and, Mexican Attorney General JesÃºs Murillo Karam has said, handed them over to a local criminal gang known as Guerreros Unidos. That gang not only had infiltrated the police department but was also complicit with Abarca, his wife and the now-former police chief, according to the attorney general. The gang burned the bodies and dumped them in a river, authorities say. But the students' families say they won't believe the account until there is proof and a thorough investigation. At Thursday's march, relatives led demonstrators in chanting, ""They were taken away alive, we want them back alive!"" In the days leading up to the protests, the families had traveled around Mexico in three caravans seeking support. The relatives also implored the backers to ensure the march was peaceful. When the protest showed signs of turning violent on Thursday night, they left. In fact, peaceful speeches and marches marked the event's first three-plus hours. But then a group of protesters -- with their faces covered -- clashed with police guarding the door to the National Palace that faces the Zocalo. Many demonstrators panicked and ran to get away from the violence, leading to a stampedes. Others retreated, chanting ""Justice!"" and slowly counting from one to 43. After a prolonged standoff with protesters throwing rocks and fireworks, hundreds of riot police swept across the Zocalo bearing shields and batons to clear out the area. Some of them used fire extinguishers against the protesters. Mounting fury over government officials' response to -- and possible role in -- the students' disappearance has convulsed the country for weeks, posing a growing challenge to Mexico's President amid demonstrations where at times violence has flared.","The demonstration was peaceful for hours before clashes broke out .

"(CNN) -- There is something deeply troubling about President Obama's decision to grant legal safe haven to unauthorized immigrants by executive order. It isn't the underlying policy that is troubling. Just the opposite. We have known for years that we would never deport some 11 million people from our midst. Many have become hard-working, productive members of our society, and Congress, working with the White House, should long ago have provided them a safe pathway out of the shadows. In that sense, this policy is good. One wonders indeed why the President, having decided to take the plunge, didn't go further and build a pathway to fuller benefits such as health care for those who establish a solid record of work and good behavior. Nor is it even the questionable legality that disturbs. On many occasions during our history, presidents have tested the boundaries of their constitutional power through executive orders: Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus, his Emancipation Proclamation, Franklin D. Roosevelt's creation of the Works Progress Administration, FDR's awful internment of Japanese-Americans, and Harry Truman's integration of the armed forces were all accomplished through controversial executive orders. During the 19th century, conventional wisdom held that presidents had only as much authority as the constitution explicitly granted; Teddy Roosevelt famously flipped that proposition on its head -- unless the Constitution explicitly forbids, he argued, the president has implied authority to act, especially as commander-in-chief. Many of his successors have agreed and usually the courts have gone along with them. Even so, President Obama's executive order on immigration seems to move us into uncharted, dangerous waters. It is one thing for a president like Lincoln or FDR to act unilaterally in national emergencies. In nearly all the big examples of the past -- like the Emancipation Proclamation -- they were also acting as commander-in-chief. As the one foremost responsible for protecting the nation's existence, a president as commander-in-chief has long been recognized as having inherent powers that stretch well beyond those of normal governance. Not an emergency . But the challenges of immigration policy do not represent a national emergency, nor do they touch upon the military authorities of a president. Rather, they represent the chronic, abysmal failures of politicians in Washington to govern well from both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. They helped create this immigration mess over a long number of years and working together, they have a public duty to solve it. The White House has repeatedly pointed to immigration-related executive orders issued by past presidents, notably Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, to support the legality of President Obama's order and to palliate its partisan sting. Both the executive orders cited, however, can be distinguished from the case at hand. Reagan granted amnesty to 100,000 undocumented immigrants to close a loophole in the comprehensive immigration reform bill passed in 1986. Bush's order, which granted amnesty to at most 1.5 million people (although the actual number who benefited is likely much smaller), also attempted to clean up a piece of legislation. As Mark Krikorian writes in National Review, the Reagan and Bush examples were presidents trying to implement congressional directives, as is constitutionally permissible, whereas the current action is the President telling Congress ""I'm going to implement my own directives."" While the President's impatience is understandable and his anger at Republican intransigence is well placed, that does not justify an abandonment of traditional ways of addressing hard public problems. Against the spirit of the Constitution . One can argue whether this executive order is legal, but it certainly violates the spirit of the founders. They intentionally focused Article One of the Constitution on the Congress and Article Two on the president. That is because the Congress is the body charged with passing laws and the president is the person charged with faithfully carrying them out. In effect, the Congress was originally seen as the pre-eminent branch and the president more of a clerk. The president's power grew enormously in the 20th century but even so, the Constitution still envisions Congress and the president as co-equal branches of government -- or as the scholar Richard Neustadt observed, co-equal branches sharing power. For better or worse, Americans have always expected that in addressing big, tough domestic issues, Congress and the president had to work together to find resolution. For a president to toss aside such deep traditions of governance is a radical, imprudent step. When a president in day-to-day operations can decide which laws to enforce and which to ignore, where are the limits on his power? Where are the checks and balances so carefully constructed in the Constitution? If a Democratic president can cancel existing laws on immigration, what is to prevent the next Republican from unilaterally canceling laws on health care? A bad way to start with new Congress . Coming on the heels of midterm elections that were a clear call for a change of course in Washington, starting in the White House, this is also a discouraging way to open the final years of this presidency. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC poll finds that by 53-40%, Americans feel positive about the election results; by 56-33%, they want Congress to set policy for the country, not the President; by 57-40% they favor a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants but by 42-32%, they disapprove of Obama overhauling immigration through executive order. Why isn't the White House listening to the public? In retrospect, it would have been far better if coming out of the elections, the President had said he had promised he would act through executive order before the end of the year, but in light of the election results, he would work with the new Congress for six months. If there were no legislation, he would act on his own. That would have been a much fairer proposition, would have started out with Republicans on better footing, and would have rallied the public behind him if the GOP refused to cooperate. Sadly, we instead have an action from the White House that will cast a dark shadow over prospects for legislative cooperation, falls short of what the immigrant population had hoped and steers us into deep, unknown waters in our governance.","David Gergen: President Obama's action on immigration is a troubling move .

"U.S. regulators issued a safety advisory on Wednesday night urging freight railroads to avoid using older tank cars when hauling highly volatile crude oil when possible. The Transportation Department action follows a string of derailments over the past 10 months, including a catastrophic explosion and fire last July that wiped out a town center in Canada, killing nearly 50 people, and another fiery accident on April 30 in Virginia. ""These accidents have demonstrated the need for emergency action to address unsafe conditions or practices in the shipment of petroleum crude oil by rail,"" the agency said in its notice that included an order for railroads to notify relevant state emergency response offices when planning to ship large amounts of petroleum crude from the Bakken oil field in North Dakota. Large shipments were classified as trains hauling more than 1 million gallons of Bakken crude, or approximately 35 tank cars. Petroleum crude is said to be more volatile than other types of shipments of that kind, and safety questions have been raised previously about large volumes of it moving through the United States and Canada. To that end, the Federal Railroad Administration and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration advised those offering oil shipping contracts and rail carriers on Wednesday ""to the extent possible to avoid the use of older"" tank cars when shipping Bakken crude. Regulators are ""strongly urging"" the use of tank cars with the ""highest level of integrity available in their fleets"" when hauling that product. ""All options are on the table when it comes to improving the safe transportation of crude oil, and today's actions, the latest in a series that make up an expansive strategy, will ensure that communities are more informed and that companies are using the strongest possible tank cars,"" said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. The Transportation Department also said it aims to move forward with new regulations on tank car standards. Accidents cited by regulators included: . The April 30 derailment of a CSX train with 105 tank cars loaded with petroleum crude in Lynchburg, Virginia.  Seventeen cars jumped the tracks, triggering an oil fire. Some 350 people were evacuated. Up to 30,000 gallons of crude spilled into the James River. Last December, a BNSF train hauling more than 100 cars of petroleum crude hit the derailed car of another train in North Dakota. The locomotive and 21 tank cars left the tracks, dumping 400,000 gallons of oil and triggering a massive fire. Some 1,400 people were evacuated. Last November, a 90-car petroleum crude oil train operated by Alabama & Gulf Coast Railway derailed in Alabama. Twenty-six cars were involved, triggering a fire. The worst was last July when an unattended freight train loaded with petroleum crude rolled down a grade in the town of Lac-MÃ©gantic, Quebec. The resulting explosion and fire leveled the small community's downtown, killing 47 people. The freight rail industry, represented by the Association of American Railroads, said it has worked for years with emergency responders to educate them about hazardous materials. ""These open and transparent communications will continue as railroads do all they can to comply with the Department of Transportation's emergency order,"" the group said in a statement. In February, the industry announced steps in conjunction with the Transportation Department that included stepped up track inspections, improved braking procedures, new route analysis, and speed restrictions. The industry at the time said it would continue to work with regulators on new tank car standards. Safety officials wary of growing use of trains to ship oil .

"Apart from having one of the coolest names in the tech industry, Padmasree Warrior stands out among Silicon Valley's big-wigs. The Indian-born woman has been hotly-tipped as the next chief of the world's largest maker of data networking systems -- Cisco Systems -- the company behind everything from your computer's router to wireless access points. She is currently Cisco's Chief Technology and Strategy Officer, an organization boasting an eye-watering $47 billion in revenue. As one of the most influential people working in the technology industry today, it's little wonder Forbes named Warrior the 57th most powerful woman in the world. Here are five things you might not know about Warrior, who has also served on the board of Chicago's prestigious Joffrey Ballet. She studied chemicals, not computers. Warrior received a degree in chemical engineering in Delhi, before continuing her studies in New York. The young graduate thought she'd eventually go back home to teach -- it wasn't to be. Warrior took a job at telecommunications company Motorola in 1984, and later joined Cisco in 2007. ""I now run an internet technology company that has nothing to do with chemicals,"" she told CNN's Nina dos Santos. ""At no point in life have I waited for the perfect job to show up... because there's no such thing."" She planned to stay at Motorola 12 months -- and left 23 years later. During her two decades at Motorola, Warrior rose to the ranks of executive vice president. While there, the company was awarded the prestigious 2004 National Medal of Technology and Innovation -- the first time in the organization's history. In 2014, it's harder to keep up with new technology than ever before, says Warrior. ""I've been in the tech industry for almost 20 years, but I feel right now is probably the most significant time -- not only is the pace of change so fast, but the magnitude of change is huge."" Yes, she does log off -- and meditates. Just because you're leading one of the biggest computer equipment companies on the planet, doesn't mean you have to be constantly plugged-in. At the end of each day, mother-of-one Warrior apparently turns off all her electronics and finds 20 minutes to meditate. She's a Twitter pro. Warrior has a whopping 1.4 million Twitter followers, including U.S. President Barack Obama. She gives followers an insight into her world outside of the office, posting images of her paintings, novels she's reading, and even her weekend fashion choices using the hashtag #warriorstyle. This is the best career advice she's ever received: ""I was a manager and really thinking about taking the next step to become a director. And I was hesitating, asking myself 'Is it too much responsibility?' My husband worked, and we had a young son at home, and I wasn't sure if I was ready to commit. And my boss at the time, who was making me the offer, said: ""You know, sometimes when there's a door open you just have to push through and walk in.""

"How many Ferraris does it take to impress a hotel valet in Boca? More than 25, apparently. The guy driving us around the opulent Boca Raton Resort and Club in his hotel-issued golf cart was non-plussed by the abundant wealth on display in the driveways and parking lots around the property. How many Ferraris were here? ""Twenty to twenty-five,"" he said, shrugging.  How many BMWs? ""Too many to count."" This is Palm Beach County, of course, where money ain't a thing. But there was even more money here this week: The resort was playing host to the the Republican Governors Association's annual meeting, always a magnet for major GOP donors, corporate fixers and political consultants looking to get some some face time, and maybe a contract or two, with the 31 Republican governors and governors-elect who now control state houses around the country. ""It's a target-rich environment,"" said Texas Gov. Rick Perry. ""Governors are able to talk to businesses from around the country that are looking to re-locate and looking to expand ... I've gotten a few scalps here."" Perry joined a half dozen other potential 2016 presidential candidates, including Chris Christie, Rick Perry, Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal, John Kasich and Mike Pence. They were all more than happy to soak up attention from admirers and make nice with potential contributors. ""If you are an individual who is running for office, this is a good place to be to meet people who have a lot really good ideas about how to to do public policy, and meet men and women who want to see good government put into place,"" Perry said. ""And it's up to the point of, 'Well, I'm gonna loan you not only my name, but lend you some money as well. I'm gonna contribute to your campaign.' And that's all good. That's how this process works."" All of this means that money is in the air at events like the one in Boca, which are as much about donor maintenance and business meetings as they are about electing governors. When their donors are involved, the RGA likes to roll out the red carpet, holding their conferences at high-end resorts like this one: Past RGA meetings were held in Scottsdale, Aspen and Austin. Ferraris abound. Republican governors and their entourages were everywhere at the resort â in hallways, quiet corners, busy coffee shops and fancy dinners â making time for admirers and at least feigning interest in pitch-men from companies like G.E. and Altria who stalked the corridors. Aides stood at the ready to take their business cards. Meetings were taken, drinks were drunk, and golf was played. At the hotel bar on Thursday, one foursome of Republican golfers proudly showed off a picture on their iPhones: They had been golfing nearby at The Bears Club, founded by Jack Nicklaus, and a cigar-chomping Michael Jordan played through. They snapped a pic of him putting. The event attracted the usual pack of political press â including the ""Hambycast"" crew â eager to flee the freezing temperatures of Washington and meet sources, interview new governors and get an early bead on the Republican presidential race, which doesn't seem like it will start as soon as reporters would like it to. They also had to suffer through a  barrage of cliches about governors knowing how to lead. Did you know that states are the laboratories of democracy? You do now. Christie, the outgoing RGA chairman, passed the committee leadership baton to Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam on Thursday, but not before basking in the glow of a successful election cycle. Swarmed by reporters every time he showed his face, Christie swatted away questions about his presidential thinking and insisted that he just wanted to reflect on a winning cycle and celebrate with his fellow Republicans. ""Christie did a fantastic job,"" said Larry Hogan, the newly-elected Republican governor of blue Maryland and maybe the biggest surprise winner of 2014. ""The candidates and the donors and everybody here are thrilled. You couldn't do a better job, winning multiple blue states like Massachusetts and Illinois and Maryland. It's a pretty big win for Chris Christie and the RGA."" Hogan was like the star rookie at an NFL training camp, the subject of gentle ribbing from his more seasoned colleagues but also the buzziest newcomer in Boca. ""People said to me during the campaign that I seem like Christie with a softer edge,"" he said. ""We are both pretty blunt. They liked the fact that our personalities are similar."" Few people thought Hogan could win when he announced his campaign â including Christie. ""We were on the No-Way-In-Hell list for the RGA,"" he said. After Christie became convinced that Hogan could pull off a sleeper upset, he asked his fellow RGA leaders to make an investment in Maryland, even going into debt to do so. Other Republican governors were skeptical. ""They were like, Christie have you been drinking?,"" Hogan chuckled. Now the governor-elect, Hogan indulged every major donor who wanted a handshake â and every every reporter who wanted an interview. Perhaps he was too unguarded. He let slip a fact that no Marylander should ever reveal: He's never watched ""The Wire."" Not one season. ""Maybe I'll watch them all when I retire,"" he said. And maybe he'll retire in Boca.","Republican governors met in Boca Raton this week .

"Washington  (CNN)The men and women of the 114th Congress, despite being bitterly divided and partisan, almost universally share one thing in common: Their faith. Nearly 92% of Congress -- or 491 of the 535 members -- identifies as Christian, according to a study by Pew Research's Religion & Public Life Project. That number is slightly up from 90% in the 113th Congress and continues a trend where the percentage of Christians and Jews in Congress outpaces their national average. Though Christians dominate both parties, Democrats are more religiously diverse than Republicans. Of the 301 Republicans in the 114th Congress, Jewish freshman Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York is the only non-Christian. A large majority of Democrats in Congress (80%) are Christian, with 44% Protestant, 35% Catholic and 1% Mormon. But unlike Republicans, Democrats in Congress are 12% Jewish and have two Buddhist, two Muslims, one Hindu and one unaffiliated member. ""You could say that the religious diversity in Congress is concentrated on the Democratic side,"" said Alan Cooperman, director of religious research at Pew. ""The vast majority of the Jews, all of the Muslims, Buddhists and Hindus in Congress and the one unaffiliated member are all on the Democratic side."" Congress, the most representative and responsive branch of the federal government, has seen some aspects of their religious affiliation mirror nationwide trends. For example, as the country has grown more religiously diverse over the last 50 years, so has Congress. Only 3% of the 87th Congress (1961-1962), according to Pew, was non-Christian. Today, that number has roughly tripled to 6%. What's more, there has been a noticeable decline in Protestants that mirrors nationwide trends. In 1961, 75% of Congress and roughly 2/two-thirds of the country identified as Protestant. Fifty-seven percent of the 114th Congress is Protestant, while 49% of the country identifies as such today. One area where nationwide trends have not been reflected in Congress is with the religiously unaffiliated, the most underrepresented in the country. Though 20% of the country does not identify with a faith, only one member of Congress -- Rep. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona -- publicly identifies as such. Cooperman said the under representation of unaffiliated Americans might be a political decision by members of Congress. ""One of the things we have seen in our surveys is that the American public says one thing they like to see in candidates for office is strong religious beliefs,"" said Cooperman, who noted that when Pew asked voters what qualities impact their vote, the most negative attribute was someone who doesn't believe in God. ""On the whole, American adults tend to say that they do want strong religious beliefs in candidates and they tend to say that they would be less likely to vote for someone who says they do not believe in God,"" he added. ""Candidates are reflecting the views of the public when they do tend to affiliate with a religious group.""","Nearly 92% of Congress -- or 491 of the 535 members -- identifies as Christian, according to a study by Pew Research .

"The 32-year-old son of actor and kung fu star Jackie Chan has been arrested in Beijing on drugs charges, as authorities clamp down on celebrity offenders. Police say they detained Jaycee Chan, who is originally from Hong Kong and also an actor, as well as Kai Ko, a 23-year-old Taiwanese actor, during a raid on Thursday in Dongcheng district, the city's commercial and cultural center, state media, citing Beijing police, said Tuesday. Both men tested positive for marijuana. Police later found more than 100 grams of the drug after searching Chan's apartment. He was also accused of ""hosting others to take drugs,"" the state-run China Daily said. He could face three years in jail under Chinese law. State broadcaster CCTV aired footage of Chan, his face blurred, showing police where the drugs were hidden at his home, while Ko was shown making a tearful apology. ""I very much regret about what happened. I'm very sorry to those who support me, like me or even know me personally,"" he said. ""I just want to tell them I'm really sorry. I've set the worst example, which had the most terrible influence. And this is a huge mistake."" Celebrity targets . The two actors are being seen as the targets of the capital's latest anti-drugs campaign, which has seen more than 7,000 people detained for using drugs, a 72% year-on-year increase, according to the China Daily. Celebrities are increasingly in the spotlight, with a number of high-profile arrests over drug-related incidents in recent months, including popular movie actor Zhang Mo and singer Li Daimo, who was actually sentenced to nine months in jail for hosting a crystal meth party at his home, according to the China Daily. Earlier this month, dozens of management agencies representing performers in the entertainment industry signed an agreement with Beijing authorities banning drug use from the industry and pledging to sack artists who break the law. The elder Chan, who has starred in a number of Hollywood movies including ""Rush Hour"" and ""The Karate Kid,"" has actually campaigned against drug use, and was named an anti-drugs ambassador in China in 2009.
