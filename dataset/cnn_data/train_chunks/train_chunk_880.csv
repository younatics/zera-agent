"By . Will Stewart In Moscow . and Ian Birrell In Crimea . The crisis in Ukraine deepened last night as warning shots were fired at international observers seeking to monitor the rapidly growing Russian military build-up in Crimea. Forty gunmen in balaclavas and military fatigues aimed warning shots above a car leading a convoy of 57 unarmed civilian and military observers from the Organisation of Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). At least three shots were fired from automatic weapons and although no one was injured, the incident was seen as a dangerous widening of the conflict. OSCE military observers negotiate with a pro-Russian soldier (centre) at the Chong check point blocking the entrance to Crimea . The observers retreated for the third day in a row, with the Kremlin evidently not prepared to allow them to witness the accumulation of Russian weaponry which some Ukrainians fear could eventually be used in a full-scale invasion. And in a separate incident, a Ukrainian border patrol plane came under fire while flying near Crimea yesterday. No one was hurt, according to Ukranian officials who reported the incident. They said the Diamond light aircraft, with three crew, was on an observation mission. It was not immediately clear where the gunfire came from. A protester uses a catapult during clashes with riot police in downtown Kiev . The OSCE’s failure to gain access is a setback for US President Barack Obama who had seen the organisation as a means of defusing tension in the region. In Russia, the observers were subjected to a propaganda blitz, with TV bulletins describing them as NATO stooges who had been invited to Ukraine by the new interim government in Kiev, which Moscow does not recognise as legitimate. In a further dangerous development, Russian troops encroached beyond Crimea, threatening a village in the Kherson region, which borders the Crimean peninsular. A Ukrainian TV station reported that parents in Chonbar had banned their children from going to school because ‘the muzzles of the Russian APCs (armoured personnel carriers) are directed right at the centre of the village’. Members of a pro-Russian self defence unit stand in formation as they take an oath to the Crimea government in Simferopol . Residents raised Ukrainian flags above their homes in protest at the Russian incursion. The Ukrainian army also claimed that about 200 military vehicles, some with Russian licence plates, had been seen heading into eastern Crimea in one of the biggest troop movements since the crisis began. One 60-vehicle convoy, which included field kitchens, was followed to a military airfield at Gvardeiskoye, near Simferopol, the Crimean capital, with armed soldiers visible in the back. The conflict in Ukraine is so far bloodless but there are fears one mistake could tip it into a war on the doorstep of the European Union. Pro-Russian demonstrators take part in a rally in front of a statue of Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin in central Kharkiv . Poland yesterday evacuated its consulate in Sevastopol due to ‘continuing disturbances by Russian forces’. In Donetsk and Kharkiv protesters gathered in their thousands to demand a Crimean-style referendum on leaving Ukraine. They carried Russian and Soviet flags, chanting:  ‘Russia! Referendum! Kharkiv!’ and holding banners reading ‘NATO-No!’ In Moscow, state-run TV reports were engaged in a propaganda blitz over Ukraine. Their bulletins were full of phrases such as ‘Nazi gangs’ and ‘militants’ to describe the pro-Western Kiev authorities and the ‘threat’ they pose to eastern regions. A young pro-Russian woman holds a placard with heart shapes and smiley faces reading 'Russia' and 'Berkut!' Last night, Moscow was accused of sending thousands of undercover agents into Ukraine to stir up unrest in regions not yet under Russian control. Dubbed ‘Putin’s tourists’, they pose as wedding guests or relatives of Ukrainian citizens, but when their luggage is searched at the border, a different and more menacing story emerges. At one checkpoint in the north-eastern Kharkiv region last week, a group of visitors who claimed they were on their way to a friend’s wedding were found to be carrying camouflage uniforms, masks, knives, gas sprays and Russian newspaper reports on the political situation in Ukraine, according to a spokesman for the state border service in Kiev. Before being sent back into Russia, the men admitted they had been hired by a Moscow-based private security agency. Armed men, believed to be Russian soldiers, walk near the Ukrainian naval base at the Crimean port of Yevpatorya . Around 2,000 ‘agents provocateur’ – some carrying arms – have been stopped at the border but it is thought many more might already have infiltrated across the porous 1,500-mile frontier between the two countries. Border force spokesman Oleksandr Zhdanenko said there were ‘strong suspicions’ the infiltrators’ aim was to deepen the political crisis by encouraging pro-Russian agitation in areas of the country outside Crimea, which is already largely under Moscow’s control. Meanwhile, Yulia Tymoshenko, Ukraine’s former prime minister, was last night receiving medical treatment at Berlin’s Charite hospital. Doctors said it was too soon to say how long the treatment will take and what lasting damage the 53-year-old might have from three slipped discs she suffered while in prison.

"By . Rose Prince . Sales of the Italian sparkling wine prosecco are soaring, with one major retailer, Majestic Wine, reporting a 39 per cent increase in sales. Some say it’s because of our squeezed wallets: the cheapest bottle of champagne costs around £14 while prosecco can be as little as £6.50. But there is also evidence that we Brits actually prefer the taste of the North-East Italian-made fizz. Lovely bubbly: There is evidence that we Brits actually prefer the taste of North-East Italian-made prosecco to French Champagne . ‘People like prosecco because it’s less acidic than champagne,’ explains Russell Norman, proprietor of Italian restaurant chain Polpo. But he adds: ‘It must not be seen as a poor man’s champagne — it is a very different and distinctive drink.’ The bubbles behave differently for a start: in champagne, they quickly disappear after it has been poured; good-quality prosecco has a persistent foam on the surface that gives it a special creaminess. The lower price of prosecco, and its Spanish rival cava, is due to the less intensive production method used compared with champagne. For the French add yeast to each bottle to create a second fermentation that gives the wine its particular fizz. Prosecco, on the other hand, is . usually made using the ‘Charmat’ process, where the second fermentation . takes place in a vat, cutting the cost of production. A . version of prosecco has been made in Northern Italy for more than 400 . years. Originally, it was marketed as a health drink. But it was not . until the Sixties, when its sugariness was reduced, that the British . acquired a taste for it. According to Mr Norman, Italians favour ‘extra dry’ while we prefer the less sweet ‘brut’. Since . the vogue for rustic Italian food, popularised by TV chefs Jamie Oliver . and Antonio Carluccio, took over our kitchens, prosecco has become . undeniably chic. Whereas . once it would have been regarded as cheap or naff to serve a sparkling . white at a wedding in place of champagne, prosecco has become the . stylish, unexpected alternative. Here, we put a selection to the test. Prosecco Superiore Extra Dry (Valdobbiadene),  £7.29 . A . pleasant straw colour, with a slight earthy scent and light, sweet . citrus flavours. But it lacks the classic flowery tones that would have . given the wine more character. Verdict: Good value, but the flavours are a little too faint. Extra Special Prosecco Brut (Treviso), £6.50 . A . good foam on the surface and the wine continued to bubble happily long . after pouring. Flavour is between sharp apple and peach. Verdict: One of the lowest-priced wines, this is the best value for money and best for those who prefer a less sweet taste. Bella Cucina Prosecco Extra Dry, £6.99 . A . pale coloured wine, lacking the subtle sunshine tint typical in a . prosecco. Didn’t bubble as pleasingly as some of the others . but the warm, toasty flavours of this sweeter wine were delightful. Verdict: Great-looking rustic bottle and enough character to want to pour another glass. Best for everyday Italian dinners. Valdo Oro Puro Extra Dry (Valdobbiadene), £8.65 . A . very persistent foam which didn’t go flat even when left standing, . energetic bubbles and a good prickly, fizzy texture on the palate. Plenty of sweet orchard fruit flavours. Verdict: Might be too sweet . for some tastes but excellent quality. Best for mixing with peach juice . for a sparkling Bellini cocktail. Follador Superiore 2012 Extra Dry, £15 . A . pretty, pale gold wine with excellent effervescence providing lots of . movement on the palate. Floral-scented, with a hint of elderflower in . the flavour. Verdict: A luxurious wine that looked and tasted . superior to many of the others. At the same price as cheap Champagne, . this is more than a match for its French rival. Best for prosecco . connoisseurs. Prosecco Superiore Extra Dry (Conegliano Valdobbiadene), £7.29 . A . pale-coloured wine with an initially healthy foam that subsided . disappointingly quickly. The flavour was a little robust, almost with . tones of brandy. Verdict: Great if you like a sparkler with a little fire and punch. Zardetto Extra Dry (Conegliano), £11.99 . White . with a creamy froth and the right stinging fizz you look for in an . exciting prosecco. Flavours were gentle and very classic. Verdict: All the qualities you’d hope for in prosecco, though perhaps too subtle for some, this is the best luxury buy. Majestic Wine — Prosecco Zonin Brut, £11.99 . The . most vigorous fizzer of all, with fast-moving bubbles that prickled on . the palate. The flavour is not that of a classic prosecco — more like a . rounded, dry white wine. Verdict: All the vitality and quality you need in a party wine. Best when you want to impress . Prosecco Special Cuvee Brut, £6.49 . A . plodding fizz that never quite sparked, and of all the Brut wines, the . one with the strongest acidity on the palate.  A taste of sharp lemons, . even limes, threatened to be overpowering, but a little floral hint . comes to the rescue. Verdict: The cheapest sample and not the best, but it has a certain charm. Prosecco (Ora), £9.99 . There’s . no indication on the bottle to show if this is an extra-dry or brut . wine, and it is so spare and delicate that it is not easy to tell. Slight lemony flavours, but otherwise quite mild. Verdict: I wanted . this wine to be as rich as its golden colour, but it will suit the . sweet-averse drinkers and serve as a useful mixer for cocktails.","Sales of the Italian sparkling wine prosecco are soaring .

"By . Will Stewart In Moscow . and Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 07:48 EST, 28 October 2013 . Arrested: Nikolai Rakossi, nicknamed the 'Russian Rambo', fled the U.S. before the bodies of his lover and her daughter were found stabbed to . death. He has been arrested in Russia . A suspected double murderer nicknamed 'Russian Rambo' who fled to Moscow soon after his wife and stepdaughter were knifed to death in April 2011 has been arrested and charged near Moscow. Nikolai Rakossi, 60, is wanted in the U.S. for the brutal stabbings of his wife Tatyana Prikhodko, 56, and her daughter Larisa, 28, in their Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn home. The former Soviet paratrooper flew back to Moscow on a one-way ticket on April 17 before the women's bodies were discovered. Police said Rakossi has been detained in Novomoskovsk, about 140 miles south of Moscow, and . charged with double murder. He denied the accusation and is being held in custody because authorities consider him a flight risk, according to New York Post. 'The court has taken into attention that . Rakossi is accused of a grave crime which can result in him being . jailed for 20 years, or for life, and concluded that there is every . reason to believe that the charged person might try and escape . investigation,' court spokeswoman Olga Dyachuk said. 'The court therefore satisfied the investigator’s petition and Rakossi will spend two months in Tula detention center number 1.' After reaching Moscow, Rakossi vanished, with sources saying relatives helped hide him for more than two years. The case is now under the supervision of the Russian Investigation Committee, equivalent of the FBI. While Russian laws forbid the country’s citizens being extradited, New York Post reported he will face trial in his homeland based on evidence supplied by the U.S. Andrei Yartsev, chief spokesman of Tula police, said: 'The results of the American side’s investigation were passed to the Russian General Prosecutor’s office so that the person can be charged with a criminal offense.' Together: Larisa Prikhodko, left, and her mother Tatiana, . center, were killed in New York in April 2011. Larisa's sister . Svetlana, right, believes suspected murderer Nikolai Rakossi led a double life . In March last year, Prikhodko's other daughter Svetlana . Prikhodko, now 33, spoke exclusively to MailOnline. She . believed Rakossi was being hidden by family and friends in Russia, . in the grim industrial city of Novomoskovsk where he owns an apartment . and where one neighbor claimed to have seen him since the double . killing. 'I . have no doubt it was him, none at all,' said the neighbor, asking to . remain anonymous for her own safety. 'He looked worried and tense.' Svetlana told New York Post she and her family believe Rakossi led a sinister double life in New York, and he killed his wife and stepdaughter because they found out about it. 'The facts point to something far darker and more sinister than anyone could have imagined,' she said. 'The quiet subdued Rakossi was living a double life ever since the moment he landed in the U.S. 'Arriving on a tourist visa, he charmed Tatyana and soon asked her to marry him and became part of the family.' The family said they did not have 'a clear picture of what Rakossi was doing during these 11 years. He never held a regular job and claimed that he did construction work on the side.' Svetlana said she suspected his annual trips to Russia where he kept an apartment and car. Stunning: It is believed that Larisa Prikhodko, pictured, walked in on her mother and Rakossi arguing . Victim: Sources suggested Rakossi had a secret life that was discovered by the two women. Larisa is pictured . It was claimed that on the day of the murders, Rakossi was repeatedly on the phone to Russia, both before and after the killings. 'Rakossi made almost 20 phone calls to Russia, starting at 5.30am, though typically he seldom called anyone,' a source told MailOnline. 'The calls were only briefly interrupted at 2.40pm for ten minutes when he committed the first murder. He then resumed calling until 3.40pm when Larisa walked in, resulting in, another ten minute interruption in the calls.' New York Post reported Rakossi had called his sister Lydia, 62, who lives in Novomoskovsk, soon after the killings. 'He was in tears. He told me: ‘Please don’t keep any offence in your heart about me. Forgive me. You will never see me again',' she said. 'Then he ended the call.' Lydia said she didn't hide her brother in Russia. Doting: Tatyana and Larisa leave behind Larisa's daughter Ryan, 3, who was with her father at the time . Unanswered: Sources say Rakossi was on his phone for hours before and after the killings - and question why . The killings were carried out clinically, without a single scream to alert neighbors in the block. 'Who was this Rakossi that he allegedly knew how to handle a knife so expertly and kill an adult without even a cry from the victim?' a neighbor said. 'And what animal must he be to murder a young mother as she opened the door to her mother's apartment an hour later? What possible monstrous force and deed could have caused such an act of violence? 'No one deserves the horrible end that Larisa and Tatyana met.' Secrets: Svetlana believes Rakossi, pictured with his daughter Yevgenia in 2007, is being hidden by his family .

"By . Rose Prince . They are calling it the greatest cherry harvest ever, with the trees leaning over, drooping beneath the weight of their deep red fruit. Pickers are working every daylight hour in Kent and Herefordshire. After a campaign to revive British cherry farming, this most luscious of fruits is back and — thanks to this year’s weather — yields are nearly treble those of 2012. The cherry-growing harvest is expected to be worth £20 million, up from just £7.5 million last year, and the season is set to last longer than ever, well into September. ‘Last year we picked 100 tonnes. This year we expect to pick 250,’ says Sarah Neaves, a third generation cherry farmer from Kent. The greatest cherry harvest ever? Trees are leaning over, drooping beneath the weight of their deep red fruit and pickers are working throughout the day in Kent and Herefordshire . ‘This season has been great for us due . to the dry weather and plenty of light, but we also had a very cold . winter, which cherry trees like because they can hibernate.’ Cold . and frosty weather allows the trees to ‘shut down’ and build reserves . of energy for blossoming and fruit. It also kills pests and fungus that . can wreck harvests. Sarah . leads me along a neat line of cherry trees being harvested on her . family’s farm near Sittingbourne. The Neaves’ orchards are planted in . small, hedgerow-lined fields, with tall poplars acting as windbreaks. Dry weather and plenty of light after a cold spell are ideal conditions as cherry trees can hibernate in winter . At one end are the beehives, home to the all-important pollinators. On every tree, perfectly firm and shiny cherries in varying shades of crimson are decadently large. Each bunch, the size of a man’s hand, must weigh a pound. And between the glossy dark leaves, there are at least one hundred bunches on every tree. The pickers, wearing traditional leather-belted wicker baskets around their hips, bury themselves among the leaves to get to the fruit. ‘We only pick fruit that has reached . the right shade — the colour tells you how ripe the fruit is,’ says . Sarah. ‘Cherries continue to ripen after picking, but only a little, so . it’s important to pick them when they are perfect.’ Seven years ago, the Neaves’ farm had 30 acres of old cherry trees, but they mainly grew apples and pears. Cherry farming had dramatically declined. Where there had been 5,000 hectares of cherry orchards in Kent at the beginning of the 20th  century, by the end there were just 600. ‘The fruit was small and the quality low. The supermarkets were buying cheap fruit from France,’ says Sarah. After we joined the Common Market, British fruit growers, who did not get an agricultural subsidy, found they could not compete with cheaper imports. Thousands of acres of cherry orchards were destroyed. A cherry picker at work. Sarah Neaves, also a cherry farmer, from Kent, says: 'I think the most fantastic thing is how beautiful these trees are. I just love to come to work every day' (picture posed by model) Supermarkets used to be full of cheap fruit from France, but there's a renewed interest in homegrown food . Ten years ago, with a new interest in . home-grown produce and the Cherry Aid campaign led by Henrietta Green of . the crusading Food Lovers Britain movement, farmers looked again at . cherry farming. Richard Harnden, director of research for Berry Gardens . Growers, says that the old way of farming cherries had to go. We needed . to adopt the practices of French, German and Belgian growers in order to . compete. ‘In Kent’s orchards, we grew huge trees, so long wooden ladders were needed for picking,’ he says. ‘It was picturesque, but it was just not practical. With today’s health and safety considerations, pruning and picking would be impossible.’ The trees in the Neaves’ new orchards are small. Just before they blossom, they are enclosed by metal frames covered with rain-proof plastic and netting at the sides to protect the fruit from its great enemy — birds. Helen Green, pictured, led the Cherry Aid campaign which energised farmers to look at cherry farming again . The Gisela dwarf rootstock that the Neaves planted in 2006 is German: the bushy, high-yielding trees can be easily picked and covered for protection in the growing season. Their farm, Little Sharsted, is no longer little with 85 acres planted with cherries. The family has grown fruit there for more than 50 years. Sarah’s grandfather Archie took on the farm, and her father Brian followed him. Sarah, 46, went into insurance when she left school, but came back to the farm at the age of 23. She runs it with her brother Edward and farm manager William Dixon. They work with eight other farms in Kent, Herefordshire and Scotland, growing fruit for supermarkets. An old barn is now a packing plant. They employ some locals, but most of the 60 pickers and packers are students from Lithuania, Bulgaria and Romania. The conditions in which they live and work, their pay and hours are bound by ethical audits. Many return season after season. The new British cherry is very different to the fruit you used to see being sold by the side of the road or in markets in the towns and cities. During a short season in July, you could . pick up a brown paper bag of small, firm, bright red cherries weighed . out by the pound. They were a real treat. When I was a little girl, my . friends and I would hang pairs of cherries from our ears as pretend . earrings. It was the Seventies and our mothers would never have allowed . us to get our ears pierced, so the seasonal summer cherry served as a . delightful — and edible — substitute. The fruit we loved then are now . heritage varieties, which originated from the wild Mazzard or Gean tree, . which grew up to 75 ft high (you can only imagine the health and safety . issues involved in picking them). Varieties . derived from these ancient trees include the romantically named Merton . Heart, Roundel Heart, Florence and Waterloo. Today, few of these are in . commercial production, but some survive in old kitchen gardens and . ancient orchards. The new British cherry is different to the fruit once sold by the side of the road or in markets in the towns and cities . Unusual among these are the white Frogmore, one of the earliest cherries of the traditional season, or the gorgeous, orangey red, golden fleshed Napoleon. Sour cherries still grow in old orchards — black varieties such as Morello or the Kentish red. Merchant is an early heritage variety still grown in Kent, grafted onto the super-efficient Gisela stock. But most of the big sellers are modern fruits, with Kordia being the favourite. Big, deep ruby red and full of sweet juice, it tastes amazing. My only criticism is that it is too large to fit in my old-fashioned cherry stoning gadget. So these magnificent fruit have to be pitted by hand before I can make jam and puddings. All this abundance shows British cherries have fought back to become a prominent crop. ‘As the trees mature they will yield more and more,’ says Sarah Neaves. She chooses a cherry from one of the baskets on the ground and eats it. ‘I think the most fantastic thing is how beautiful these trees are. I just love to come to work every day,’ she says.","The cherry-growing harvest is expected to be worth £20 million, up from just £7.5 million last year .

The 51-year-old actor started the treatments two years ago, and believes they have dramatically improved his complexion. Other fans include Victoria Beckham, 40, who began having the facials after a visit to Japan. Billed as an alternative to Botox injections, the droppings – which are collected on the Japanese island of Kyushu – are mixed with rice bran and water before being applied as a mask and left to soak into the pores for an hour. They contain enzymes which are said to break down dead skin – restoring complexions that have been damaged by ageing and sun exposure – and were traditionally used to help Japanese geisha remove the thick white make-up they were expected to wear.

"By . Associated Press . A missing captain who may have abandoned his fishing boat when it got stranded off a popular San Francisco beach also has an outstanding warrant for his arrest, authorities said Tuesday. A $75,000 arrest warrant was issued in 2012 for Timothy Lybrand of Santa Cruz when he violated probation by failing to appear in court, records say. He was arrested and convicted for possessing drugs and drug paraphernalia in 2010, Santa Clara County sheriff's Sgt. Kurtis Stenderup said. The revelation comes a day after the Coast Guard called off its hourslong search for Lybrand, 51, after scouring an area around San Francisco's Ocean Beach where his 40-foot vessel ran aground in 10-foot-deep waters. Scroll down for video . Have you seen me?  The Coast Guard suspended its search for Lybrand, a captain who may have abandoned his fishing boat early Monday when it got stranded off a popular San Francisco beach. Lybrand has a warrant out for his arrest . Stuck: Lybrand's fishing vessel The Paloma is stuck in the breakers of Ocean Beach on Monday . A salvage operations team pulled the partially capsized boat close to shore Tuesday but did not see Lybrand inside, Lt. Theo Vaughan said. There are no plans to continue looking for him, 'unless we get additional information that he's in the water,' Vaughan said. Crews worked Tuesday to remove the boat . and hoped late afternoon high tides would help propel it to shore. There . was a smell of diesel fuel in the air but no visible signs of sheen in . the water, Vaughan said. The Coast Guard called off its search around noon Monday after a helicopter, two boats and a beach rover looked for the missing captain. Search crews, including the Coast Guard, . the National Park Service and the San Francisco Fire Department, . patrolled an 18-square-mile radius from Ocean Beach to the iconic Golden . Gate Bridge to no avail. Mysterious: On Tuesday, it was revealed that Lybrand has an outstanding $75,000 arrest warrant was issued in 2012 when he violated probation by failing to appear in court . Convicted: He was arrested and convicted for possessing drugs and drug paraphernalia in 2010 . 'The decision to suspend a search and rescue case is always difficult,' Capt. Mike Day said. 'Given . the close proximity to shore, and the vessel operator's stated . intention to abandon the vessel, as well as the extensive search effort. ... I have made the decision to suspend the active search.' The captain apparently made a call from his vessel to other nearby boaters asking for help around 3:30 a.m. Monday — about an hour after he left shore, Lt. Cmdr Shawn Lansing said. '(Lybrand) said he was 'on the rocks' and considered getting off the vessel,' said Lansing, who added that Lyband intimated that he would try to swim to shore while wearing a life jacket. Lybrand's vessel is registered with the Port of San Francisco, spokeswoman Renee Dunn Martin said. He usually fishes alone along the California coastline, she said. Larry Collins, president of the San Francisco Community Fishing Association, said Tuesday that Lybrand has been fishing for more than 30 years. 'We're all worried. We care about him. He's a fine guy, a real good fisherman,' Collins said. 'We hope he ran ashore. We'd like to know if he made it.'

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . and Alasdair Glennie . BBC newsreader George Alagiah has been diagnosed with bowel cancer. He will be off air for the near future while he receives treatment, the BBC said today. The 58-year-old, who has been a familiar figure on TV news bulletins for many years, is said to be 'optimistic' about a positive outcome. Newsreader George Alagiah has been diagnosed with bowel cancer, the BBC said today . Mr Alagiah, his wife Francis and Jane Ashley (daughter of Laura Ashley) in 2006. He is 'hopeful for a positive outcome' from his diagnosis, it was said today . The Sri Lanka-born journalist has been the face of BBC1’s News at Six since 2007. He was made an OBE in 2008's New Year Honours. In a statement the BBC said: 'He is grateful for all the good wishes he has received thus far and is optimistic for a positive outcome. 'George asks that he and his family are given the space and privacy they require whilst he recovers. 'Our thoughts are with him and his family and we send them our very best wishes during this time. 'Until such time as George is well enough to return to work the BBC News at Six and GMT on BBC World News will be presented as usual by familiar faces from BBC News.' Mr Alagiah first began hosting the 6pm news bulletin in early 2003, but he stepped up to front it solo four years later following the departure of his co-host Natasha Kaplinsky. He has been married to his wife, Frances Robathan, for 30 years and has two sons, Adam and Matthew. He was educated at St John's College, an independent Catholic boarding school in Portsmouth. He went on to read politics at Durham University's Van Mildert College. He has previously been a prominent . foreign correspondent, often as a specialist in Africa with coverage of . civil wars in Somalia and Liberia, as well as the genocide in Rwanda 20 . years ago. Mr Alagiah . joined the BBC 25 years ago after working as a print journalist and he . has gone on to write a number of books including A Home From Home, which . looked at what it means to be British. He has also presented other . shows such as Mixed Britannia, looking at the UK’s mixed-race . population. Bowel . cancer is the third most common type of cancer in men, behind prostate . and lung, with almost three-quarters of cases affecting people over the . age of 65.

Beating Bowel Cancer, said: 'We’re sorry to hear that George Alagiah has . been diagnosed with bowel cancer. We wish him all the best with his . treatment and recovery. 'Almost 41,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year in the UK, that’s one person every 30 minutes. 'However, bowel cancer is very treatable when caught in the early stages when over 90% of cases can be successfully treated.' The news of his diagnosis came as researchers found that one in three of us has a gene that can more than double the odds of developing bowel cancer – and the more processed meat you eat, the higher the risk. Bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer. If diagnosed in its earliest stages, the chance of surviving a further five years is 90 per cent and a complete cure is usually possible, according to NHS statistics. Mr Alagiah with former news co-host Natasha Kaplinsky. A statement issued today said: 'George asks that he and his family are given the space and privacy they require whilst he recovers' Processed meat products have  long been blamed for increasing the odds of the disease, with some studies finding that eating as little as one sausage a day can lead to tumours. But this latest research is the first to find a gene that links diet with the disease. In the future, people’s DNA could be tested for rogue genes – and then given a diet to keep tumours at bay. In the largest study of its kind, University of Southern California researchers pooled ten previous studies to compare the DNA of more than 9,000 people with bowel cancer and a similar number without the disease. The results, published in the journal PLOS Genetics, showed that around one in three of us has the rogue gene, according to researcher Jane Figueiredo. Genes come in pairs, and those who have one flawed gene and eat the most processed meat are almost twice as likely to develop bowel cancer as those who have healthy DNA. Having two rogue genes means the risk is increased 2.7 times. It isn’t clear how these foods interact with the gene to increase the odds of the bowel cancer, but it may be because they tamper with the immune system. Mark Flannagan, of the charity Beating Bowel Cancer, said: ‘There is strong scientific evidence that red and processed meats can increase your risk of bowel cancer. ‘This study reinforces the message that it’s important to reduce the amount of red and processed meats that we eat. ‘We recommend that eating less than 500g (1.1lb) of red meat a week and avoiding processed meats as much as possible.’ The study’s co-researcher Dr Li Hsu said: ‘The possibility that genetic variants may modify an individual’s risk for disease based on diet has not been thoroughly investigated but represents an important new insight into disease development.’","The 58-year-old is said to be 'optimistic' about a positive outcome .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . Children's books are becoming increasingly violent because they have to compete with gory video games, a bestselling children's author has claimed. Writer Robert Muchamore – whose hit Cherub series has sold more than eight million copies worldwide – said youngsters are more and more desensitised to violence because they see it so often on their TV and computer screens. But he said he is happy to put 'brutal' material in books as long as it passes what he terms the 'EastEnders test', meaning anything that would be seen on the gritty BBC soap is acceptable in his own stories. Author Robert Muchamore says children are comfortable with violent scenes in books after watching action films and playing gory computer games . Mr Muchamore also hit out at 'white, grey-haired, elderly' writers such as War Horse author Michael Morpurgo and Jacqueline Wilson, saying they are seen as 'deeply uncool' and turn teenagers off books. He told the Daily Mail: 'My competition is not Swallows and Amazons or Enid Blyton. My competition is Halo 5 and Grand Theft Auto and the Avengers Assemble movie. 'I think if you make kids' books too twee and say there should be no violence and they should all be about nice cosy little worlds, it is like fighting with one arm tied behind your back. 'I think my EastEnders test is quite a nice one, because it is still the most watched programme in the country by teens. When I'm writing something I ask 'Would this get by in an episode of EastEnders?' In 2011, Mr Muchamore's books were . banned from the library of Highgate junior school in north London after . parents complained they were unsuitable for their children. Mr Muchamore says he is competing with computer games like the Halo series (pictured) rather than 'Swallows and Amazons' The 41-year-old claims it was a misunderstanding prompted when he was booked to speak to the school's primary age children. He said he would never recommend his own Cherub novels – about a division of the British intelligence services that recruit young orphans as agents – to anyone under the age of 12. But he claimed the recent bestseller The Hunger Games has raised the bar of what is acceptable in children's literature. He said: 'Children of nine and ten are reading The Hunger Games and it is such an incredibly violent book. It is basically a book about kids thrown into an arena to kill each other. The depiction is brutal. In terms of violence that is a real game changer.' He added: 'Sometimes people say to me the violence in your books is brutal and nasty and depicted in detail. I actually think that is quite important. 'If someone in my book gets punched in the face the next day they have a swollen eye, and maybe they have to go to hospital to have a detached retina looked at, and maybe they feel guilty about it. 'There are consequences. What I dislike is cartoonish violence. 'I don't put in graphic sex . scenes, and the swear words are pretty tame. And if children don't like . it, they will self-censor and put it down.' Mr Muchamore insisted authors need to keep younger readers interested, even if it means including material that would have been deemed unacceptable in the past. He said: 'We went through this phase with children's laureates, with Jacqueline Wilson and Michael Morpurgo and Julia Donaldson and they were all these white, grey haired elderly people. 'They would all be on the news talking about the nice cosy world of children's books and how lovely it was to sit in a library. And I was sat there thinking about 12 and 13 year old kids who would think how uncool it all was, and why would they ever bother reading books.'","Robert Muchamore says children are now more desensitised to violence .

"By . Nicky Harley . and David Love . Carly Flockhart, of Inverness, stole thousands from her own company to fund her gambling addiction . A mother with an online gambling addiction embezzled tens of thousands of pounds from her own company to try to pay off debts of more than £120,000. Carly Flockhart’s habit began after the drowning of her partner, William Reid, the father of her son. The tragedy prompted the mum to seek ‘solace in the excitement of online gambling’, according to a psychiatrist’s report. But the 29-year-old’s habit saw her lose her home and now she faces jail if she fails to repay the £66,514 she took from her business partner. Sheriff David Sutherland ordered psychiatric reports on Flockhart, from Inverness, after she admitted taking £66,000 from cleaning equipment firm WC Supplies while she was company secretary. The theft took place over a two year period while she was in charge of sales from 2009. She held a one-third partnership in the business. Prosecutor Karen Smith told a previous hearing at Inverness Sheriff Court: ‘This was not an elaborate plan where false records were kept. She was paying money into her own account and raising false invoices to cover that amount. ‘It came to the attention of other members of the company in October 2010, when a county court judgment was awarded against the company by a supplier. ‘An invoice for £2,400 was not paid and their bank account was frozen. The invoice was subsequently paid. ‘The suspicions of one of the other shareholders were aroused about the finances of the company and he asked an accountant to investigate. Flockhart will be sentenced at Inverness Sheriff Court later this month after she admitted stealing thousands . ‘When confronted about the missing money, she broke down in tears and confessed.’ At the hearing yesterday, Marc Dickson, defending, said: ‘She worked very hard to develop the business, but unfortunately she was beset by a number of personal difficulties. Carly Flockhart became addicted to gambling following the death of her partner who drowned . ‘She suffered from post-natal depression and in 2007 her partner and father of her son drowned at sea. My client turned to gambling to negate her loss and the psychiatrist who compiled today’s report said she found solace in the excitement of online gambling. ‘Her debts to the gambling company exceeded £120,000. She is now subject to a bankruptcy hearing; the equity in her house which she no longer owns and other spare funds have been paid in to a trust to repay her creditors.’ Sheriff Sutherland said he wanted more details of Flockhart’s current financial position. Deferring sentence to August 22, he said: ‘The priority here is to try and get the money repaid to a small company which has suffered a heavy loss.’ After the hearing, WC Supplies director Alan Walker claimed he went without pay for almost a year to keep the business afloat. He said he felt ‘very betrayed’, adding: ‘It was all local businesses who were owed money and I nearly went bankrupt. But I was determined that they got paid.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Carly Flockhart, 29, turned to online gambling after her partner died .

"By . Jonathan Petre . and Ollie Gillman . Students have delivered scathing verdicts on many of Britain’s degree courses, describing them as boring, poorly taught and badly run. Social Work at an Essex college  and ‘Strategic Communication  for Fashion’ at the University of the Arts in London received the most dismal satisfaction ratings in a  Government survey. Critics say the students’ verdicts show that the worst courses, which cost up to £9,000-a-year in tuition fees, should be axed as they do not offer value for money. Best of the worst: South Essex College topped the list for most boring and worst course . The survey, commissioned by the Government’s Higher Education Funding Council, asked students  more than 20 questions and the data has been added to the Government’s official website Unistats to help people choose universities. Only 28 per cent of the students who responded believed their lecturers were enthusiastic, with just one in five saying they had made the subject interesting. A decision to scrap the Social Work BA course at South Essex College of Further and Higher Education, which was given the lowest satisfaction rating – just 12 per cent, has already been taken. Not one student who answered the survey thought this course was ‘well organised’. Even elite universities did not escape scrutiny, with only 60 per cent of students studying Economics at Cambridge University saying that their professors kept them interested in the subject. Less than half of the students on Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering and English courses who responded to the survey at Manchester University – another so-called elite institution – said their lecturers had made their subjects interesting. False economy: only 60 per cent of economics students at Cambridge said their professors kept them interested . Campaign for Real Education spokesman Chris McGovern said: ‘Degree courses with high levels of student dissatisfaction are perpetrating a fraud. ‘Students are running up vast debts to subsidise a sub-standard product. We need a much stricter validation and monitoring process. Youngsters deserve a better deal than is currently on offer from too many university departments.’ Rachel Wenstone of the National Union of Students said: ‘Low student satisfaction rates for courses should be a major concern for any university, especially as these students were surveyed at the point of leaving, which hints that if they had concerns prior to filling in the survey, then these might not have been addressed.’ Principal and chief executive of South Essex College, Angela O’Donoghue, said its Social Work course would close in two years. She added: ‘We are very concerned about the students’ feedback and take such feedback extremely seriously, which is why we took this decisive action. ‘We are already looking at ways of ensuring that such a situation does not occur again.’ Manchester University declined to comment.","Calls for worst to be scrapped as they aren't value for money .

"By . Gemma Mullin . A teenager died on her way to school yesterday morning after being hit by a lorry near a pedestrian crossing on a busy south London road. Police spent several hours attempting to track down the 13-year-old schoolgirl's parents after she was struck by a lorry on the South Circular road in Catford, south London, shortly after 7.30am. The girl is believed to be a foreign exchange student after she was heard speaking French and a post-mortem examination will take place this afternoon. Flowers have been left in tribute to the girl who was hit close to the zebra crossing in south London today . The crash happened just metres from a pedestrian crossing on Brownhill Road, near the junction with Stainton Road. Residents have said it is the second fatal collision near to the crossing after an elderly woman was killed earlier this year. Witnesses have described hearing a loud bang and several schoolchildren around at the time. John Lowe, 34, told the News Shopper: 'I heard a really loud bang, I rushed out and there was a girl lying on the floor and her pencil case and schoolbag were on the floor.' 'That crossing is really dangerous.' The father-of-three also said that he tried to call emergency services but they were already on their way. Bobby Spencer, who lives nearby, said he heard a bang: 'I'm not sure if she was on the zebra crossing or not. Schoolkids were crowding round, looking scared. Officers are still trying to trace the girl's parents . 'There were a lot of people standing around. No one was doing anything for this poor girl.' He said that the road where the accident took place has seen many incidents and is 'lethal'. 'There was a motorcyclist killed here and a dog was run over - I think there have been three or four accidents in the past year. 'It has got to change, it's so dangerous. 'This is the main road between Kent and London, so it's always chaos in the mornings. 'Loads of kids use it to get to school'. Davina Pitt, who lives on the same road, said: 'It was awful, there were loads of kids around. 'From what I understand she was walking with her friends in a group. 'I heard the poor girl might have been French speaking - some kind of exchange student. 'It really makes me worry about my son going to school alone.' She added: 'This road is so busy and as a mum you dread getting one of those awful phone calls. 'It means loads of kids use the bus stop, but there's only the zebra crossing and no others for miles. 'They should really do something, install some more pedestrian lights.' It is thought she may have been on her way to one of two local schools in the area, Sandhurst or Torridon. Residents have laid flowers at the scene including Jodie Painter who looked shaken and red-eyed. She said: 'The poor angel was the same age as my daughter. I saw the lorry there this morning, I don't want talk about the details, it's too horrible.' She added: 'There have been so many accidents here, it's still not safe. 'I'm starting a petition to make the road safer because I really worry about my daughter and all the other poor kids. I'm trying to do something about it. 'I've only lived here four months and I've seen three or four accidents. 'It's disgraceful. I just feel so sorry for her poor family.' Police and ambulance staff were called to a collision on the South Circular road in Catford, south east London . Metropolitan Police have said that the 39-year-old lorry driver, who stopped at the scene, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He has been bailed until October 17 pending further inquiries. Officers advised motorists to avoid the Catford area of the A205 as the road was closed in both directions between the Catford Gyratory and Verdant Lane while the investigation was carried out. Any witnesses or anyone with any information are asked to call the witness lines on 020 8285 1574.

"By . Gemma Mullin . This is the moment a ‘reckless’ motorcyclist tore along a suburban street at 92mph in a 30mph zone. Michael Lambert has been banned from driving after camera footage caught him speeding through the village of Seghill in Northumberland at more than three times the limit. The images show the 32-year-old crouched over the front of his bike in a racing style, without number plates, when he was clocked on the A190. Residents living in the village of Seghill, Northumberland, have described the incident as 'disgraceful' Police were forced to use other CCTV footage in the area to track Lambert down following the incident, which has been described as ‘disgraceful’ by residents. Police motor patrols chief inspector, Julian Bowran, said: ‘At 90mph he was doing more than three times the legal limit and his actions were reckless, foolish and could have been disastrous. ‘A collision at that speed could have killed or seriously injured him or other road users.’ He added: ‘A speed camera caught Lambert on the A190 in Seghill and although we didn’t have his licence plate, motor patrols officers carried out inquiries, including checking CCTV footage in the area, and were able to identify him as the rider.’ Michael Lambert, 32, has been banned from driving and escaped with a suspended prison sentence . Jim Clough, 82, who runs community groups for young and elderly residents in the village, said: ‘It’s just disgraceful going that fast. It’s very, very worrying.’ Resident Elsie Harvey, 76, of Seghill Community Association, added: ‘It could have been disastrous.’ Lambert, of Airedale, Wallsend, admitted dangerous driving following the incident on September 3 when he appeared at South East Northumberland Magistrates’ Court. He was given a 10 week jail sentence suspended for a year and ordered to serve 180 hours community work and pay £500 in costs and a £80 victim surcharge. Magistrates revoked his licence and banned him from the roads for 15 months, when he will have to re-sit his driving test. Chief Insp Bowron added: 'These actions are that of one irresponsible and dangerous motorcyclist and we recognise he does not represent bikers as a community. 'The majority of bikers are safe and sensible, they know how vulnerable they are on a motorbike and how important it is that they ride safely and defensively. 'This case should send a message out to dangerous drivers and riders that dangerous driving will not be tolerated.'

While James Packer's penthouse apartment perched atop the new Crown Casino in Barangaroo Sydney could sell for as much as $100 million, it's not the only luxurious and extravagant apartment on the market. Though the billionaire's company Crown has no yet lodged a development application for the towering property proposed to be built at Sydney's Barangaroo, predictions say the apartment planned to be built at the very top might sell for up to nine figures compared to similar property around the world.

"By . Freya Noble . An historic Sydney property belonging to the Anglican Church has now been on the market for more than two years, but with a price tag of over $20 million is yet to sell. In light of this, Archbishop of Sydney Glenn Davies will move into the heritage-listed mansion, located in Darling Point in Sydney's eastern suburbs. Bishopscourt has been vacant since Archbishop Peter Jensen retired a year ago, and his replacement did not move in as the house needed renovations and the church had placed it on the market, the Sydney Morning Herald report. Centuries old property Bishopscourt is on the market for $25 million but has not sold in the past two years . In a vote at the church council Synod in 2012, 452 out of 579 members voted in favour of selling the property in a historic decision. Previously it had been occupied by the current archbishop. The 6,216-square-metre neo-Gothic estate is on the market for $25 million, and has been owned by the church for more than a century. It was originally listed for a five year period, but that window could be extended. Chairman of the Anglican Property Trust Dr Robert Tong told the publication: 'Synod authorised a five-year window for the sale because we always knew this might be a lengthy process'. It is located in the exclusive area of Darling Point in Sydney's eastern suburbs . Archbishop Glenn Davies is expected to move into the property before the end of this year, after renovations are completed . The property was listed in 2012 after a historic decision was made by the church . Renovations on Bishopcourt are set to take place in August and September of this year, and Archbishop Davies is expected to move in before Christmas. The property went to auction in March but bids did not even meet the $20 million mark. Local buyers have apparently been negotiating prices in recent months. The Anglican Church said the mansion could be on the property well beyond the date in October 2017 it is currently listed until. Bishopscourt comes with stunning views of Sydney harbour . The church say it could be on the market until October 2017, perhaps longer . The neo-Gothic mansion features intricate carved interiors and spectacular stained glass windows . Built from sandstone, some of the mansion's most prominent features include the stained glass windows, and intricately carved doorways. A porte-cochère - a porch like structure - in the form of a Gothic chapel was added in 1860 by architect Edmund Blacket, when the property was still held its original name of Greenoaks. An actual chapel was constructed in 1935 by Professor L Wilkinson after the house was sold into the hands of the church. The enormous property spans more than 6216-square-metres .

'It was definitely a special day where a lot of factors all came in to line.' 'I'm just stoked to have been able to share probably the best longboard session of my life,' Ingleby admitted. At times, Ingleby had to crouch low down in the wave to avoid being knocked off his board . He was on a surf trip at the Telo Island Lodge in West Sumatra, Indonesia . The surfing pro said the way he chose to shoot the footage was a little risky but it certainly paid off. 'I've been using a GoPro since the HD Hero was released in 2010 but this was the first time I have successfully captured this many keeper clips in one surf. 'I personally think this is the most immersive point of view when shooting but tail mounting a GoPro has its difficulties like water splashing the lens or whether to wear a legrope or not.

"By . Freya Noble . An Australian Olympian who has struggled openly with depression and recently pleaded guilty to drug charges has broken her silence and spoken about some of the darkest days of her life including taking drugs. In an exclusive interview with Channel Nine's A Current Affair, former diver Chantelle Newbery, who claimed the first Australian gold medal in 80 years at the 2004 Athens Olympics, opened up about her drug use following her mother's death to breast cancer. 'I have experimented with a couple of things but I wouldn't say I was a drug user,' Newbery told the Nine Network. 'On and off, perhaps every now and then, since then but there's been no period of time where I have been using drugs or anything like that.' Scroll down for video . Former Olympic champion Chantelle Newbery has spoken out for the first time in detail about her drug charges and battle with mental health . The mother-of-two said she resorted to trying drugs - on and off - around the time of her mother's death 18 months ago. Her mother spent her final year living with her. Newbery said her experience with drugs was that 'it doesn't help' and it was behind her now. 'Mum fought a pretty good fight, she was diagnosed with breast cancer three years before she passed away and she lived with me in the final year and she passed away in our home,' she said. The 37-year-old pleaded guilty to possession of dangerous drugs and failing to properly dispose of syringes earlier this month. She was placed on a drug diversion program and no conviction was recorded. She also spoke of the time she tried to take her own life. 'I had never faced anything like that before, I had never in trouble with the law before... So it was a little bit overwhelming for me,' she said. At the peak of her career Newbery broke records but after 2004 she struggled with mental illness and personal demons . The former darling of the diving platform relived the moment eight police officers raided her home looking for drug paraphernalia, searching her house, car and through all of her belongings. 'I was asleep at the time, The police came to my house and told me they were searching for drugs... They did find drug paraphernalia,' she said. However, the former Olympian insisted that they did not turn up any actual drugs, and the used needles and plastic zip-lock bags discovered did not actually belong to her. Refusing the name the actual owner of the items, Newberry described how overwhelmed she was by the situation as the reason she took the blame. She welled up as Tracey Grimshaw asked her whether she had pleaded guilty to the to protect someone she cared about. 'Yes that is fair,' she responded. On why she pleaded guilty, Newbery revealed 'I was overwhelmed on the day, I was hysterical'. At the peak of her career in the pool, the golden girl broke records when at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games she became the first Australian in 80 years, and the first Australian woman ever, to win gold on the diving board. The mum-of-two has previously spoken publicly of her battle with depression, and said she struggled again with her mental health after her mother died. The mum-of-two told the program the drug paraphernalia found in her house did not belong to her, but admitted to experimenting with substances in the past . And though she did experiment with drugs during tumultuous times in her life, Newbery said at no point would she have described herself as 'a drug user'. Since then she has battled with grief, financial difficulty and finding a permanent place to live. All this combined with the breakdown of her marriage with fellow diver Robert, the father of her two boys, saw Newberry plunge into a dark place again. Five years ago she attempted suicide, but said despite the ongoing hardship she has faced since she has never resorted to that again. Newbery revealed that she has struggled financially, had trouble finding a place to settle down but her focus now is on providing a stable life for her two sons . Newbery has come up against many challenges over the past decade, but revealed her focus has now shifted to rebuilding her life and focusing on her two sons, Ryder and Jet. 'I feel pretty bulletproof when I'm at home being a mum ... I'm a mum and I've got a job to do, and you've just got to get on and do it,' the gold medallist said. She also revealed she regualrly sees a psychologist, and insisted that no one would ever find drug paraphernalia in any home she was living in again. Newbery, who revealed in 2009 that she suffered depression, said while she hoped to work with divers in the future, her main priority was being a mother to her two sons. 'At the moment I just want to spend time just being a mum.'","Chantelle Newbery revealed she took drugs following her mother's death .

"By . Freya Noble . A clash between two Sydney private boys' schools at the weekend saw records broken and spirits crushed as the victors trounced their rivals 101-0. The rugby union game took place between Scots College, located in Bellevue Hill in Sydney's eastern suburbs, and Newington College from the inner-western suburb of Stanmore, on Saturday. Scots College completely annihilated their competitors - preventing Newington from scoring a single point. Scots College dominated Newington College during a rugby union match at the weekend . The smashing was so substantial that even the scoreboard couldn't cope - the highest number it could display was 99, according to The Daily Telegraph. Scots scored 15 tries in the match, and converted 12 of them. Aamzingly Newington College were the 2013 joint premiers and six of their players are currently representing New South Wales in the sport. Only four of the Scots College players are doing the same. Last year the premiership was shared with the opponents that absolutely dominated them at the weekend. The match was played as part of the fourth round of the Greater Public Schools (GPS) 1st XV competition. Scots (pictured) and Newington were joint premiers of the 1st XV Greater Public Schools competition in 2013 . Rugby Union in Australian has its roots in private schools and variations of this particular competition have been running since 1892. The GPS 1ST XV currently has only six schools that take part in the round-robin tournament: Scots College, Newington, Saint Ignatius' College at Riverview, St Josephs College in Hunters Hill, The Kings School in Parramatta and Shore - Sydney Church of England Grammar School in North Sydney. The 2nd XV includes the same six colleges, while the 3rd XV brings in Sydney Grammar School, The Armidale School and Sydney Boys High School. Newington didn't manage to get a single point on the board while Scots scored 15 tries, 12 of them and converted . The Scots College Old Boys Union sent their congratulations to the winning side on their Facebook page, and one man commented on the post 'did it for Teague boys! #clap for James'. He was referring to the tragic death of former Scots College student and rugby union fanatic James Teague, who who died in a New Zealand hospital after falling 10 metres from a hotel balcony at ski resort in Queenstown three days ago. A tribute to the Sydney teenager was read out at the Saturday night game between the NSW Warratahs and the ACT Brumbies which took place in Sydney, and Teague was supposed to attend.","Scots College beat Newington College 101-0 in the clash on Saturday .

"By . Freya Noble . For the first time since the crime that made international headlines was pulled off, John Killick has spoken about the moment his lover Lucy Dudko hijacked a helicopter and helped him escape from a Sydney jail. In an interview with Channel Seven's Sunday Night, Killick revealed just what happened on the day, and during the weeks following, he and his girlfriend executed one of Australians most notorious breakouts. In 1999, Killick was imprisoned in Silverwater jail, serving time for a series of armed bank robberies. His girlfriend, a librarian originally from Russia, went to see him in jail as often as she could. Notorious Australian criminal John Killick has revealed to Sunday Night the moment his girlfriend Lucy Dudko hijacked a helicopter and busted him out of a Sydney jail . It was during these visits the pair decided that Killick would break out of prison. 'She was visiting me all the time and you can get three visits a week and she came out three times a week. I rang her as often as I could. And we decide ""look um I’m going to get out,""' Killick told the program. In preparation for Killick's escape, Dudko took a joy ride over the site where Sydney Olympic Park was being constructed in the lead up to the 2000 Olympic Games. The night before the big day, Dudko ate dinner at the home of Killick's former wife Gloria, where she had been staying since her lover had been locked up. Killick's lover Lucy Dudko (left) was living with his wife Gloria (right) when she executed the daring escape . The couple planned the great escape when Dudko's visited the prison three times a week . In another curious detail, the criminal revealed his girlfirend had hired the 1975 action film Breakout, about a woman who hires a pilot to break her husband out of jail and watched it in the week before the real thing. On March 25, 1999, the Russian librarian jumped in a plane with helicopter pilot Timothy Joyce, under the guise of another scenic tour. Joyce recounted the moment he knew something was awry, as Dudko was paying particular attention to Silverwater jail. 'I looked over my shoulder... and as I looked back she had pulled a pistol out of her purse and she put it to the side of my head and said ""this is a hijack"",' the pilot revealed. Pilot Timothy Joyce also spoke to the program, and told of the moment Killick's lover held a gun to his head . The helicopter hijacked was a Bell 47, and pJoyce was tied up after he was forced to land the aircraft . From there Joyce was forced to land in the grounds of the jail, while Killick jumped in the aircraft and prison officers fired shots in his direction. He flew the couple about 7 kilometres from the facility, before he was forced to land and tied up the pair who were now on the run. Killick and Dudko were then forced to flag down a car and hijack it, as Killick recalled his lover admitted 'We have no car - I've forgotten the keys'. The fugitives drove the vehicle to North Sydney station where they dumped it and jumped on a train to Goulburn, well aware they would have officers hot on their tails. Killick was only released this year after serving time for a strong of armed robberies and the helicopter escape . For 45 days the couple managed to avoid authorities, as they slowly made their way south to Victoria, changing hair colour along the way and travelling by bus and train. Their downfall came when they ran out of money and were forced back to Sydney to reclaim money from one of Killick's criminal friends who owed him cash. In a caravan park on the outskirts of Sydney they were cornered and arrested, and Killick was only recently released from jail for the daring escape. Just weeks ago, he handed himself in to Brisbane police after he lost a case to be extradited from New South Wales. Killick must now abide to extremely tough parole conditions and wears an ankle monitor full time.","John Killick escaped prison in 1999 when his girlfriend Lucy Dudko hijacked a helicopter .

If the biggest alcohol distributor in Australia goes ahead with industrial action, half the bars, pubs, and clubs in New South Wales could be left with crowds of unhappy customers. Truck drivers at delivery company BevChain are expected to vote on the action on Wednesday, after negotiations over a new industrial agreement were halted. The drivers, who are members of the Transport Workers Union (TWU), were in talks with management about pay increases and safety concerns, The Daily Telegraph report. If alcohol delivery truck drivers strike, bars across the state could be left without booze . BevChain deliver half of the beer in NSW to licenced premises, and are a the largest alcohol distributor nationwide. They operate in five states from 14 distribution centres. James Squire, Corona, Tooheys and James Boags are just some of the beers the company delivers, and they also have wine and spirit brands such as Brown Brothers and Bacardi under their belt. A business partnership between Lion Nathan breweries and supply chain company Linfox, BevChain could take an indefinite strike or refuse to work overtime if their complaints are not met. Employees are campaigning for an increase in their Super contributions and a 16 percent pay rise per year. BevChain is the largest distributor in the country and transport beers such as Corona . According to transport website Fully Loaded, earlier this month the Fair Work Commission approved an application for the drivers to hold a ballot to gauge the amount of support there was for industrial action. 'We’ve been in there trying to negotiate for a fair agreement that recognises our hard work and dedication, but it seems like the company doesn’t want to hear it,' Greg Leslie from the TWU’s negotiation team said. The negotiations are said to have been running for as long as four months, and the company could be thrown into chaos if the drivers go ahead with a strike.

Along with the title for the year, the airline also nabbed a record, becoming the only carrier to win the prestigious award four times after claiming the title in 2003, 2005 and 2009. Australian airline Qantas slipped out of the top 10 for the second time, coming in at number 11. Last year Qantas ranked 10th, and its highest position was in 2008 when it was named third in the world. It comes after some setbacks for the airline this year, including job losses and questions over foreign ownership. Scroll down for video .

Earlier this month the airline suffered some bad press when an Airbus A380 bound for Melbourne was forced to turn back after water flooded the aisles. A leaking pipe caused water to spill into the upper deck cabin, prompting some passengers to share photos on social media - including American actress Yvette Nicole Brown, best known for her role on the sitcom Community. Malaysian Airline, previously a top 10 airline on three different occasions, experienced a sharp decline in the wake of MH370's disappearance, now ranked at 18th. The annual World Airlines Award announcement came at the Farnborough International Air Show in the UK, and the awards are based on research by aviation firm Skytrax. Cathay Pacific Chief Executive Ivan Chu told The Sydney Morning Herald that he was 'extremely proud, for both Cathay Pacific and Hong Kong' to receive the award. Second and third place were given to Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines, while Emirates slipped to fourth from first place in 2013. Locally, it was better news for Qantas as they were named the Best Airline in the Australia/Pacific region. Virgin Australia and Air New Zealand rounded out the top three. Indonesian airline Garuda won the award for best cabin crew . The best first class cabin was taken out by Singapore Airlines . The ranking also includes divisons for best cabin crew, which was taken out by Garuda Indonesia, and the best first class cabin, awarded to Singapore Airlines.

"By . Emily Crane . and Freya Noble . China has issued a bizarre denial of comments made by Julie Bishop to a Fairfax journalist, which prompted a tabloid attack on Australia's Foreign Minister. China's The Global Times newspaper called Ms Bishop a 'complete fool' after she told Fairfax last week that Australia had to 'manage for the worst' when dealing with China. But, perhaps in an attempt at smoothing diplomatic relations, China's foreign ministry has denied Ms Bishop ever said that - despite the Sydney Morning Herald publishing excerpts from the interview to prove it. In a statement released by Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hong Lei, China said Ms Bishop never made the remarks and 'the Australian side has clarified that with the Chinese side through diplomatic channel'. Scroll down for video . The Global Times used a Beijing colloquialism to describe Julie Bishop as a 'complete fool' as it responded to comments made by the Foreign Minister in an interview last week . Australia's history of human rights was also targeted in the original Global Times article, who described the country as a place once 'roamed by rascals and outlaws' that would soon adjust to the shifting realities of power. 'Australia's history is not short of records of human rights infringement on the aboriginal population,' the Global Times reported in its Chinese and English editions on Monday. 'The country used to be a place roamed by rascals and outlaws from Europe. Perhaps it has to boast its values to cover up its actual lack of confidence in front of Western countries.' The newspaper's editorial described the Foreign Minister as a 'complete fool' as it responded to the comments made by Ms Bishop in the Fairfax interview. Hu Xijin is the editor of the Chinese tabloid, the Global Times, which published the editorial taking aim at Ms Bishop on Monday . The Chinese editorial compared Ms Bishop's comments to that of Prime Minister Tony Abbott when he told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last week that he 'admired the skill and the sense of honour' of the Japanese troops who attacked Sydney Harbour during World War II. 'If Abbott's words were meant to flatter his visiting Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe, Bishop's provocation appeared to have come out of nowhere,' the editorial read. 'The current Australian government has been widely considered as inexperienced, particularly in dealing with foreign relations. Still, the naivety of its foreign minister still surprised Chinese people. 'China is Australia's biggest trade partner and has not offended Australia in any way. Bishop's verbal provocation made her look more like one of the often pointless 'angry youths' found in the Chinese cyber sphere than a diplomat.' The editorial compared Ms Bishop's comments to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's when he told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last week that he 'admired the skill and the sense of honour' of the Japanese troops who attacked Sydney Harbour during World War II . Australia has relied heavily on the Chinese market in exports  so the Federal Government's stance on China will fluctuate, according to the newspaper. 'Bishop calls for standing up to China, but what resources does she have to do so with? The next day, Australian leaders will smile at China again, just as they do now to Japan,' it read. 'For many Chinese people, Australia is a good place for business, travel and higher education. That's about it. There is no point in China being overly upset by Bishop's words.' The Sydney Morning Herald today published an excerpt of the original interview between Ms Bishop and journalist John Garnaut, where they were discussing Australia's relationship with China. 'Bishop: Well, we're pragmatic and we're realistic. We know that the optimum is deeper engagement ... but we're also clear-eyed about what could go wrong. And so you have to hope for the best but manage for the worst.'","A Chinese tabloid used a Beijing colloquialism to call Julie Bishop a fool .

The abolishment of the carbon tax was one of the key policy planks of Tony Abbott when he was elected to government last year. One of the key changes is a penalty imposed on entities that do not pass on savings to gas and electricity customers. The penalty would be 250 per cent of the saving that has not been passed on. It also removes reference to 'domestic' electricity and gas customers, potentially leaving it open for companies to be penalised if they don't pass on savings to overseas customers. The definition of 'entity', which replaces 'corporation', is expanded to include individuals and 'any party or entity which can or does buy or sell electricity or gas'. Prime Minister Tony Abbott promised an immediate drop in power prices should the Senate scrap the carbon tax as expected prior to Mr Palmer's decision . The time in which entities have to give the consumer watchdog a notice they are complying with price cuts has been set at 30 days after the bill gains royal assent. Entities face a $34,000 fine if they don't comply - double the original fine. Mr Palmer said the amendments were lodged with the Senate Clerk's office at 8.30am. 'We asked that it be distributed and we had a violent action from government, a violent reaction I would say,' Mr Palmer said. 'We had ministers calling us and visiting our senators and complaining.' Mr Palmer defended his party's move, arguing the changes ensure savings would be passed onto consumers. Mr Palmer claimed he had been on the receiving end of 'nasty conversations' with the government and other people. Prime Minister Tony Abbott promised an immediate drop in power prices should the Senate scrap the carbon tax as expected prior to Mr Palmer's decision. The carbon tax was a nine per cent impost on power bills, a $9 billion 'handbrake' on the economy, and a $550 annual hit for households, according to the PM. Former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett says Clive Palmer is a great blimp . Former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett says Clive Palmer is a great blimp that occasionally farts, causing damage to the country. He gave the unflattering assessment of Mr Palmer on Fairfax Radio when he asked to comment on the development that the Palmer United Party wouldn't vote on Thursday to repeal the carbon tax. 'He reminds me of a great blimp flying around this world of ours, this country of ours, and every now and then it lets off steam, or, to use a Clive Palmer expression, he just farts,' Mr Kennett said. 'That's all he does, he floats around, he causes trouble, there is no logic to what he is doing and it can be so damaging to this country.' Palmer has previously likened Australia's carbon tax to a 'fart tax' in place in New Zealand to curb methane gas emissions from the farming sector.","Clive Palmer stood up and left mid-way through an interview with 7.30 .

"By . Freya Noble . A Vietnam war veteran driving a truck with the slogan 'Stop The Mosque' splashed across the side, has been driving around Bendigo, Victoria, blasting an Islamic Call to Prayer from his vehicle. Charles Mollison is the founder and chairman of vocal anti-Islamic website Restore Australia and travelled from Queensland to protest the construction of a mosque in the city. Victorian Police confirmed in a statement they pulled the man over around 4pm on Wednesday in Bendigo's central business district. 'Police were responding to noise complaints about the vehicle, the driver received a warning regarding the noise,' the statement said. Charles Mollison from Queensland has made the trip to regional Victoria to protest the building of a mosque in Bendigo . Mr Mollison told the Bendigo Advertiser he was protesting the 'Islamisation of our society'. Police told him his signs were discriminatory but there was nothing they could do about it. 'I said, ""Hang on, hang on, are you trying to tell me if the sign said, Let's Build a Mosque, it would be okay,"" and they said, ""Yes"".' 'There are only 147 Muslims in the whole of the Greater Bendigo area so you have to ask firstly, why would they want a huge mosque that would hold over 1000 people and secondly, you would have to ask for such a small Muslim community how can they raise $5 million and build a $3 million mosque,' he told the publication. The Vietnam war hero is the founder of RestoreAustralia.org whose aim is to re-write the constitution, and has come out in support of the One Nation political party . Mr Mollison's truck protest comes after plans were approved last month in Bendigo for a mufti-million dollar mosque to be built by the Australian Islamic Mission. AIM Secretary Dr Seyed Sheriffdeen told Daily Mail Australia he doesn't understand why people are coming from interstate to do 'utterly crazy things in the street.' 'If there's local residents concerned about their normal life, we are also concerned about it. If there's Muslims disturbing their life we want to know what Muslims.' Dr Sheriffdeen also said that if the council or the courts have ruled against the mosque they would have no issue, but the Islamic community have not done anything wrong. 'They're trying to portray us as terrorists... We are the type of people who want to build bridges with other people,' he said. If constructed, the mosque will reportedly have two floors, a cafe, retail area and a sports hall on what is currently empty land in Bendigo’s east. At the moment, 300 local Muslims meet in a prayer room at the local University campus. This month the City of Greater Bendigo Council's Mayor Cr Barry Lyons launched a campaign in conjunction with the Australian Human Rights Commission called 'Racism. It stops with me.' Cr Lyons said he would not tolerate racism in the Greater Bendigo community and expected residents would not either. 'This campaign is designed to raise awareness and empower Australians to confront prejudice in their community. Greater Bendigo residents are proud and inclusive and I look forward to their full support,' he said. 'This is an opportunity for us to join together and say no to racism. It’s a simple message but a powerful one' The truck was seen in the central business district of Bendigo over the past few days . The Age reports that Mollison's anti-Islam lobby group in Queensland has also given up to $10,000 to opponents of the mosque to print anti-Islamic material. In the weeks surrounding the debate over the development proposal, residents of Bendigo noticed black balloons appearing around the town tied to trees, houses and office fronts. The balloons were left by a vocal group of protesters furious about plans to build a prayer building in the regional city. Last month anti-Islam protesters in Bendigo tied black balloons to the businesses of councillors who voted in favour of the construction . Local councillors who voted in favour of the construction said they felt 'personally targeted' by the black balloons which appeared at his business, where he also lives. 'I was a bit appalled really given the antics the anti-Muslim group made at the council chamber while we were debating,' Cr Weragoda, who is of Sri Lankan origin, told MailOnline. 'I thought ""This is obviously targeting me personally.""' An artist's impression of the $3 million complex which will serve the 200 Muslim residents of East Bendigo and will include a mosque, sports hall, education facilities and retail premises . Cr Weragoda added that the development application received 254 objections, compared to Bendigo's total population of 110,000. A spokesperson for community group Stop The Mosque In Bendigo, whose Facebook page has attracted more than 7700 likes, said it was opposed to the development because it is concerned the Muslim Brotherhood is trying to take over Australia for Islam. 'In my opinion a mosque preaching jihad and sedition decreases the security of any town,' they told MailOnline in June. The development application received 254 objections, compared to Bendigo's total population of 110,000 .","Charles Mollison drove a truck around Bendigo, Victoria with a banner that read 'Stop The Mosque' on the side while playing an Islamic call to prayer .

"By . Leesa Smith . and Freya Noble . and Aap . A spokesman for the Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has denied reports that a number of detainees jumped off a roof in a suicide attempt on Christmas Island earlier this week. He said there was no basis to the claim, and apart from that the government does not comment on reports of individual acts of self-harm. 'The minister is advised reports of multiple suicide attempts by women on Christmas Island are not correct,' the spokesman said. Prime Minister Tony Abbott's comments were also echoed by the Immigration department, who said 'It would be highly irresponsible and dangerous to allow government policy to be determined on the basis of such threats.' Scroll down for video . Sri Lankan asylum seekers prepare to enter the magistrate's court in the southern port district of Galle on Tuesday . The 41 refugees face court after being handed back to their country by Australia when a boat was intercepted off Cocos Island in late June - although their government declared they would not risk persecution if returned . Earlier in the week Tony Abbott said the Australian government would not be subjected to 'moral blackmail' when it comes to assessing who is given asylum in Australia following reports nine mothers on Christmas Island attempted suicide in the hope their children would by allowed to stay. The latest claims come as the government finally admitted in the High Court that they had intercepted a ship carrying 153 Sri Lankan asylum seekers in the Indian Ocean outside Australian territorial waters. On Thursday, a report in The Australian defined the apparent suicide attempts as 'minor acts of self harm' in an attempt to be transferred to the Australian mainland. In relation to the same incident, according to The Daily Telegraph asylum seekers returning to Sri Lanka had their iPhones, credit cards and digital cameras siezed by Australian authorities. At the detention centre on Christmas Island, reports have emerged of at least nine Sri Lankan mothers attempting to take their own lives in the past week once told by immigration officials that they would never resettle in Australia due to arriving before July 19, 2013, The Sydney Morning Herald reports. Maurice Blackburn lawyer Jacob Varghese, who represents 72 asylum seeker babies, said the women were in a ‘state of utter despair’ about the welfare of their children. Mr Abbott said he had not seen the report, but added: ""If true, it is a harrowing tale"". However, he said the government would not capitulate to 'moral blackmail' when it came to border protection. 'This is not going to be a government which has our policy driven by people who are attempting to hold us over a moral barrel - we won't be driven by that,' he told the Nine Network on Wednesday. 'No Australian government should be subjected to the spectacle of people saying ""Unless you accept us, I am going to commit self harm"".' The Sri Lankan group was charged for attempting to leave the country illegally with 27 granted bail and five remanded in custody while nine children were discharged . Meanwhile, up to one dozen Sri Lankan mothers have attempted suicide on Christmas Island in the hope that their then orphaned children would get to reside in Australia . Officials told the High Court that a boat carrying the refugees had been intercepted last week. They are still on the customs vessel in the Indian Ocean outside Australian territorial waters while their fate is decided. The government promised to give three days' notice before attempting to return the group, which includes about 40 children, some as young as two. Meanwhile, 41 asylum seekers who were handed back to Sri Lanka by Australia appeared in court to face charges of attempting to leave the country illegally. Five remained in custody while 27 were granted bail. Nine children were discharged. The group had been intercepted off Cocos Island in late June and their government declared they would not risk persecution if returned. Late on Monday, the High Court granted an urgent temporary injunction preventing the return of the 153 to Sri Lanka ahead of Tuesday's hearing in Melbourne, where Commonwealth Solicitor-General Justin Gleeson undertook to give 72 hours' notice before moving them. Refugee rights activist Ian Rintoul said the decision will come as an ‘enormous relief’ to the asylum seekers. ‘It is only a temporary fix, but it's blown a bit of a hole in the government's treatment of asylum seekers,’ he said. The government had previously declined to reveal any details about the boat, citing its longstanding policy not to comment about on-water operations. But Mr Gleeson told the High Court on Tuesday Australian authorities had intercepted the boat 12 miles from Australian territorial waters which meant their future would be determined by the Maritime Powers Act, not the Migration Act. The matter will return to court within 21 days for a directions hearing. There are also 153 Sri Lankan asylum seekers held onboard the Australian customs vessel in the Indian Ocean since being intercepted in the last week .

"By . Freya Noble . A distressed humpback whale who was trapped in fishing nets for more than eight hours has been freed after rescue efforts at The Pass in Byron Bay. The rope was apparently wrapped around the creature's dorsal fin and tail, and was spotted at first light on Tuesday morning. New South Wales Parks and Wildlife service kept and eye on the whale early in the day and in a joint effort with Queensland Fisheries officers managed to free the animal just before 4pm. Scroll down for video . A male humpback was entangled in rope for eight hours on Tuesday . Rescue crews worked for hours off the coast of Byron Bay in far north NSW . A National Parks and Wildlife spokesman Lawrence Orel told the Gold Coast Bulletin crews spent nearly two hours trying to release the entangled animal and the outlook for the whale is good. Mr Orel also told the publication calm water conditions were ideal circumstances for the rescue to take place, and the operation was successful despite the chance the whale could have become very agitated. The Guardian report that buoys were attached the humpback to slow it down, though it did try to get away from the crews working on cutting the ropes on a few occasions. Rescuers said the conditions were calm and therefore ideal for the operation . The humpback was freed around 4pm after efforts from crews . The whale was spotted at first light in Byron Bay on Tuesday morning . While the rescue was taking place people were urged to keep their distance from the whale as it could become stressed and agitated and it would be dangerous to get in the path of such a huge creature. The 12-metre creature was not the only whale freed off NSW on Tuesday, with one more on the far south coast in Narooma also rescued later in the day. On Tuesday evening, reports emerged of a third whale in distress at Palm Beach on the Gold Coast in Queensland. It's unsure whether this is the same whale freed in the afternoon.","A humpback whale was found tangled in fishing nets off Byron Bay, NSW .

"By . Freya Noble . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has started a war with renewable energy companies after he blamed them for the increase in power prices . Tony Abbott has hit out at the green energy sector claiming the renewable energy target (RET) is the cause of rising energy prices in Australia. The Prime Minister said the country is well on its way to being 'the unaffordable energy capital of the world' and that's the reason for the government's review of the RET, report The Financial Review. 'We should be the affordable energy capital of the world, not the unaffordable energy capital of the world and that’s why the carbon tax must go and that’s why we’re reviewing the RET,' he told the publication. Clean energy companies have responded to these claims saying Mr Abbott completely exaggerated the impact that the target would have, and in the long run the nation would be better off financially and environmentally from the scheme. The RET currently states that by 2020, 20 percent of energy should come from renewable sources, however this could be subject to change under the government's upcoming review. In the Senate next week the government will try to abolish the carbon tax, but opposition leader Bill Shorten has vowed to continue the crusade for action against climate change. Clive Palmer is set to block the government from lowering or abandoning the RET until after the election in 2016. Infigen, Pacific Hydro, Senvion and the Clean Energy Council are all among the companies who have disagreed with the Prime Minister's comments, and a spokesperson for Senvion said if the RET is kept in place the price of power bills will drop off by 2020. The government is currently looking to review the renewable energy target which is set to see 20 percent of energy come from green sources by 2020 . Clean Energy Council director Russell March agreed, claiming the only other alternative to the target is a switch to gas-fired power, but the price of that resource is on the up. The consensus in the renewable energy industry is that power prices will drop as more forms of renewable energy are being utilised, with some companies citing the decrease in power bills around the $50 mark. This week saw the Crawford Australian Leadership Forum take place in Canberra, and economists from around the world including Nobel Prize recipient Joseph Stiglitz and former Reserve Bank of Australia board member Warwick McKibbin were among the experts calling for Australia to have a price on carbon, according to AFR. Economists have warned against scrapping the carbon tax saying a price on carbon would be taking a step forward for Australia . Professor Stiglitz described putting a price on carbon as a 'no-brainer' and said it is more practical than taxing labour or capital, plus it would set Australia up for the future. By pricing carbon now Australia would be taking a step forward to combating climate change he said, and the world would soon follow. Aluminium refineries are also a big player in the RET debate, which are currently said to be 90 percent exempt from paying for renewable energy. The government is expected to make a move from the backbench to completely clear the refineries from paying for any form of green energy. According to Origin Energy: . 'The RET is a mandatory scheme and energy retailers (on behalf of their customers) must source a set proportion of their electricity from renewables. Retailers purchase a renewable energy certificate for each megawatt hour of electricity generated by government-accredited renewable electricity sources.' Despite aiming to deliver 20 percent renewable energy, if continued the RET is forecast to deliver a higher rate, up to 27 percent.","The Prime Minister has blamed the renewable energy target (RET) for increasing power prices .

"By . Freya Noble . Gold Coast meter maid Marki Stibi has told of the girl's biggest fan who follows them down the Surfers Paradise strip . It seems the meter maids that stroll the tourist strip in Surfers Paradise in their gold lycra bikinis have found their biggest fan. In an interview with the Gold Coast Bulletin meter maid Marki Stibi revealed that the girls get a lot of attention, but the majority comes from one particular man. 'He comes every Thursday and Sunday, he’ll just run up to us around 3pm and literally follow us around the whole time - sometimes we’re like ""Cameron, back up, please"",' she told the publication. Cameron reportedly stalks and takes photographs of all the meter maids each time he sees them and owns all the merchandise the women sell. He even wears photos of the girls around his neck, and is the self-proclaimed biggest fan of the meter maids. Since 2003 Cameron has been visiting the girls every week without fail, but despite how it may seem the maids describe him as funny, seemingly undeterred by his obsession. The man reportedly has albums upon albums full of photos of all the girls past and present. Ms Stibi also revealed how appreciative people are of their services, despite the evolution of the job since its beginnings nearly 50 years ago. The man known as Cameron has been the meter maids' biggest fan since 2003 . The meter maids have been a fixture on the Surfers Paradise strip since 1965 when they were brought in to combat the negative image the Gold Coast was branded with after the introduction of parking meters. The original women strutted down the street in golden full-piece swimsuits and tiaras feeding coins into expired parking meters and leaving calling cards on windshields. Now, the full-piece suits have been replaced with shiny bikinis and the meter maids don classic Australian akubras on their heads in lieu of tiaras.

"By . Kate Lyons . and Freya Noble . Police have arrested Scott Allen Miller, 42, over the murder of a woman found on Saturday morning in Melbourne. Miller will face court in NSW . Scott Allen Miller, who was identified as the key suspect in the rape and murder of a Melbourne woman will face court in southern NSW, police have revealed. The 42-year-old homeless man was arrested on the far south coast of NSW on Monday after a national alert was issued by Victorian police. This follows the discovery of the naked body of a 32-year-old Chinese woman in a Melbourne park early on Saturday morning. Miller will appear before Bateman's Bay Court on Tuesday, where Victorian police are expected to apply for his extradition. CCTV footage has emerged which police believe shows Scott Allen Miller chasing the young woman across St Kilda Road into the Melbourne Botanic Gardens. Police had been searching for Miller since Saturday when he was named as as a suspect in the 'extremely violent' assault and murder of a woman in Melbourne. He was taken in for questioning over the rape and murder of a woman whose naked body was found by joggers under a tree at Melbourne’s Botanic Gardens on Saturday morning. The woman is a 32-year-old Chinese national who moved to Australia to work in the hospitality industry. She has been identified by police and some of her relatives in China have been contacted, but police are yet to forensically confirm her identity and have not released her name. Homicide Squad Detective Inspector John Potter confirmed on Monday that the woman had been sexually assaulted before she died. 'This is a particularly violent assault on this woman, she has been sexually assaulted and she has been physically assaulted,' Insp Potter said. Police have no confirmed the cause of death but said the woman died at the scene. It is believed she was on her way to work at 5.20am on Saturday when she was approached by Miller. Left: Scott Allen Miller was captured on CCTV footage at a shopping centre on Springvale Road in Glen Waverley at midday on Saturday. Right: Detectives are looking to speak to the man (right of picture) who was seen on CCTV walking north along Swanston Street past the Melbourne Town Hall with 42-year-old Scott Allen Miller around 1.50am on Saturday . CCTV footage from the morning of the crime shows a woman being chased across St Kilda Road into the Botanic Gardens near the corner of St Kilda Road and Linlithgow Avenue. Miller had been sleeping rough in the rotunda at the botanic gardens, 200 metres from where the body was found. Miller was born in the U.S. and once lived in an affluent Perth suburb. In the 1990s he was a leading figure in the illegal dance party scene in Perth as director of E-Nerve Pty Ltd a company that organised raves, The Age reported. Earlier this afternoon Homicide Squad detectives appealed for help to identify a second man who was seen out drinking with Miller on the night of the crime and may be able to assist with the investigation. Police confirmed on Monday evening that the man seen on CCTV footage walking along Swanston Street with Miller about 1.50am on Saturday has now contacted police. He attended a city police station and made a statement on Monday evening, police say. Earlier on Monday, Homicide Squad Detective Inspector John Potter urged the man to make contact with police or call Crime Stoppers. The woman's naked body was discovered in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Southbank . Her body was discovered by joggers on Saturday morning under a tree in the popular park . 'We do not believe this man was involved in the woman's death, but it's important we speak to him as he may be able to help with regard to Miller’s whereabouts,' Det Insp Potter said. Miller and the other male were seen entering a licensed premises on Bourke Street between Swanston and Russell streets around 2am, where it's believe they stayed for a number of hours before leaving separately. Detectives have been told that Miller was asked to leave the establishment around 5am. He is then seen on CCTV shortly after walking south along Swanston Street and across Princes Bridge. It is believed he approached the victim at 5.20am and chased her into the botanic gardens. Police say they have connected Miller to several items found at the crime scene. Miller, who is originally from Western Australia, has been sleeping on the streets of the city for at least six weeks and is known to police in other states, although he does not have a criminal history in Victoria. While police issued a national alert, they concentrated their search on the Melbourne area. They also engaged transit police and were looking around train stations as Miller is known to travel by train. Anyone with information about the death is urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or visit www.crimestoppersvic.com.au.

"By . Daniel Mills . and Freya Noble . Mr Stowe has reportedly been sacked from his position as Fair Trading Commissioner . Two business owners in NSW face hefty fines and prosecution after Fair Trading discovered knock-off phone chargers similar to the one which killed a young mother earlier this year. The Sydney Morning Herald report that more than 260 raids took place this week and the two shop owners could face up to $87,500 in fines and a possible two years in jail. Fair Trading also apparently found a dozen businesses selling dodgy chargers and adapters, and undercover officers discovered six stalls at Paddy's markets Haymarket and Dapto markets on the NSW south coast. Also in the spotlight is consumer watchdog boss Rod Stowe, who has reportedly been stood down from his position as NSW Fair Trading Commissioner in the aftermath of the death of Sheryl Anne Aldeguer, 28, who was electrocuted by a faulty USB charger at her Gosford home. Daily Mail Australia has been told that Mr Stowe has taken leave just 10 days after it was revealed the young mother-of-two, who had moved from the Philippines to Australia for work, was killed as a result of the faulty USB charger which electrocuted her on April 23. It led NSW Fair Trading to issue an alert advising against buying the rip-off chargers which Commissioner Rod Stowe declared 'may not meet Australian safety standards' because the devices 'pose a serious risk of electrocution or fire.' But now more than a week on, Mr Stowe has reportedly left the top job despite no one confirming reports by the Sunday Telegraph that he had been sacked. Several spokespeople from NSW Fair Trading and The Department of Finance and Services have confirmed that Assistant Commissioner John Tansey had been put in his place, but there appears to be a lack of information available as to why he has suddenly been appointed as Mr Stowe's replacement. Sheryl Aldeguer, 28, was killed in April through a faulty phone charger. She is pictured here with husband Luigi . Police had warned consumers to bend the pins and throw away any rip-off USB-style chargers that led to the death of a woman on NSW Central Coast . Daily Mail Australia contacted a spokesperson for the Department Finance and Services who said he was not commenting any further other than to say 'Fair Trading Commissioner, Rod Stowe, is on leave. During this time, John Tansey will act as Fair Trading Commissioner.' A police investigation revealed on June 26 that it was a USB charger, and not a laptop as first suspected, which led to 28-year-old Sheryl Aldegur's death on the NSW Central Coast. The stall owners face fines of $87,500 and/or two years imprisonment and Mr Stowe said at the time the penalty was a 'wake-up call to people who buy cheap electronic products without realising potential hazards.' Fair Trading Electrical Product Safety Expert Lynelle Collins also said it had been five years since a similar death caused by a faulty electronic device but there was a serious risk of further deaths. 'Particularly with the Internet, people can buy stuff directly from overseas wholesalers that may not meet Australian safety standards,' she said. Meanwhile, two NSW Fair Trading media advisors, who were also contacted for comment regarding Mr Stowe's 'leave' arrangements, told the Daily Mail Australia they had been 'instructed' to direct inquiries to Melissah Bell, herself listed as a 'media contact' on the Fair Trading website. Ms Bell said Mr Stowe's leave arrangements are a matter for the Office of Finance and Services and would not comment on whether or not the leave was indefinite. 'There is nothing more I can tell you at this stage,' she said.","Rod Stowe is 'on leave' but it has been reported he has been dumped .

"By . Freya Noble . There's a certain stereotype that portrays sulking teenagers trawling the internet for hours on end, sharing infinite details about their terrible lives. However it seems that the kids have been overthrown for the title of most time spent online, by an unlikely competitor. During December of last year, teens spent a measly average of 14 hours and 42 minutes surfin' the web, while their parents and grandparents spent more than 32 hours online. Over 55s have overtaken teenagers and jumped up to the second highest internet users in Australia, according to new research by Roy Morgan . The over 55's averaged over an hour a day, according to new research released by Roy Morgan and consolidated by The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). Despite this, people in the 18-54 year old bracket topped the charts, spending an average of 40 hours and 21 minutes connected for the month. The study also revealed that teenagers are not the key drivers of growth online, due to their lack of funds and dwindling financial independence. Almost 100 percent of teenagers have broadband internet at home and the use of smartphones is increasing across the board . Over 55's racked up over an hour a day in time online according to the stats . Most Australian teens are jumping online to entertain themselves, the research found . 'Compared to adult Australians teenagers—not-surprisingly—generally have lower incomes and fewer opportunities to fully benefit from online transactional activities, content and services,' ACMA reported. Nearly 100 percent of teens have a broadband internet connection at home, 69 percent have a smartphone and 72 percent jump online more than once each day. And it seems Aussies are leading the charge on smartphone ownership, with just 36 percent of Americans in the same age bracket owning the clever little devices. Teenagers are visiting Google, Facebook, Youtube, Mi9 and Microsoft the most . The top five destinations for younger Australians were Google, Facebook, Youtube, Mi9 and Microsoft and in an unexpected turn of events 9 out of 10 of them gravitate towards the internet for entertainment. Adults overtook their kids when it came to making transactions online, proving that more and more older Australians are turning to the internet to bank or buy and sell items. The more mature members of our population are also utilising the online world in more versatile ways, as they juggle four or more activities each time they log on. Across the board, Aussies are making the switch to mobiles in lieu of traditional desktops with the gap in usage between the two devices narrowing in the last four years.","Teenagers have been toppled for the top Australian internet users .

"By . Freya Noble . and Aap . Police have identified Scott Allen Miller, 42, as a suspect in the murder of a woman found on Saturday morning in Melbourne . Police in Victoria have released a photo of a man they believe may be involved in the murder of a Melbourne woman whose body was found on Saturday. The naked body of the woman, who is yet to be formally identified, was discovered by a jogger near the Royal Botanic Gardens in Southbank about 8.30am. Officers say 42-year-old homeless man Scott Allen Miller is a suspect in the death of the Chinese woman, found in the gardens near where Miller had reportedly been sleeping. The homicide squad's Sergeant Nathan Favre said the woman was aged in her 30s and worked in hospitality. It is believed she was on her way to work when she was assaulted. 'We can't rule out sexual assault as the motivation for this offence,' Det Sgt Favre told AAP. He said police wanted to speak to Miller about several items found at the crime scene.

Capture: Brede Hangeland signed for Crystal Palace on a one-year deal after his release from Fulham . Head scratching: Crystal Palace boss Tony Pulis . And Pulis is looking to strengthen his squad even further within the next month after missing out on Gylfi Sigurdsson and Steven Caulker. Pulis saw strikers Glenn Murray and Chamakh score in the friendly defeat at Brentford while Campbell netted a hat-trick in a simultaneous friendly at non-League side Forest Green Rovers. Pulis said: ‘We have a month left of the transfer window. It does not close when the season starts so there is still plenty of time. ‘But one thing is for sure is that we won’t be signing loads of players on the final day of the window like we did last year.’ Palace signed four players on the final day of the summer transfer window last season under Ian Holloway and then Pulis left it late to add four more on the final day of the January window. After being one of the surprise packages in the Premier League last season finishing 11th, Pulis is clear what his aim is this season. He added: ‘The aim is to stay in the Premier League. That would be brilliant.’ On target: Marouane Chamakh scored for Crystal Palace in their 3-2 defeat by Brentford at Griffin Park .","Tony Pulis says Crystal Palace have not finished in the transfer market .

"By . Australian Associated Press . and Freya Noble . Father Stanislaus Hogan, 69, pleaded guilty to accessing and possessing child pornography at the District Court in Adelaide on Monday . A Catholic priest who had over a thousand child pornography images in the bedroom at the college he worked at struggled to reconcile his sexuality with his Jesuit beliefs, an Adelaide court has heard. In Father Stanislaus Hogan's locked room at St Ignatius College in Adelaide, police discovered 1,555 images and police also located magazines and videos bought legally in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Sophie David, for Father Stanislaus Hogan, said the 69-year-old had done a lot of good in his life but had now lost his teaching career and his good reputation had been 'indelibly stained'. 'He has also made clear his intention to apply to be released from his vows on August 14,' she said on Monday at Hogan's sentencing hearing in the Adelaide District Court. He has pleaded guilty to an aggravated count of possessing child pornography and a count of using a carriage service to access child pornography at Athelstone between April 20 and June 10 2012. Prosecutor Scott Swain said the ages of the children ranged between three months and 16 years. 'His main interest was in images of boys in the low-to-mid teens, the very age range of children at the school where he was employed,' he said. Ms David said Hogan, who previously taught at Xavier College in Melbourne and St Aloysius college in Sydney, sought professional help after his arrest and now had insight into his offending. More than 70 percent of the images were classed in the least serious category involving no sexual activity, but five images and videos were in category five, the most serious. The 1,555 images were discovered at Saint Ignatius College in Adelaide, however Hogan also taught at St Aloysius College in Sydney, pictured . A psychologist said Hogan had previously suffered with alcohol problems and depression, which were directly related to his struggle to reconcile his sexuality with his ethical and religious beliefs. Ms David urged the judge to impose a suspended jail term, saying he had excellent prospects for rehabilitation. But Mr Swain said such a sentence would be 'manifestly inadequate'. Hogan, whose bail was continued, will be sentenced on a later date.

'I think I’ve . learned a lot by being around him,' Miss Stone says of the actor, who she has been dating since 2011. 'And, you . know, he is an incredibly important person to me.' Indeed, it seems both have valued each others support while filming the Spiderman movies, their closeness proving more of a help than a hindrance. Busy lady: Miss Stone reveals that she is currently working on several new projects, all top-secret, though she was forced to turn down the chance to play Sally Bowles in Cabaret on Broadway due to Spider-Man . Leading lady: The actress got her break in the film Easy A, and went on to star opposite Ryan Gosling in Crazy, Stupid Love. Now she has three major movies lined up in the next year . 'It’s . not harder,' she says. 'It’s fun. It’s been fun working with him just . because of who he is as an actor and person. I think it would be fun no . matter what.'

Miss Stone - young, slender, Hollywood A-list - is a more traditional cover girl and could help win back any lost readers.","The actress is notoriously private about her relationship with Mr Garfield, who she has been dating since 2011 .

"By . Freya Noble . On Friday it was revealed four sailors have been charged over a series of 'hazing' incidents that allegedly occured in 2011. The Royal Australian Navy personnel will face court martial following a probe into apparent inappropriate and often sexual behaviour aboard the HMAS Ballarat. The navy says the charges relate to allegations which emerged in the wake of last year's media reports of hazing rituals aboard the warship. Chief of the Royal Navy Ray Griggs urged others to come forward when claims of inappropriate incidents emerged last year . In 2013, a former naval member spoke out with claims that sailors were 'set upon, stripped off and had things essentially put in their bums' to mark birthdays. At the time of the allegations, Chief of Navy Ray Griggs called for others to come forward if they knew of similar instances of alleged inappropriate behaviour. 'All of Navy has worked to make people accountable for their behaviour,' Vice Admiral Griggs said on Friday. 'There is now no doubt that all personnel are aware that Navy has no tolerance for unacceptable behaviour.' The incidents allegedly occurred on the HMAS Ballarat in 2011 . This year, four naval members said to be involved in the incidents will face a general court martial. Three have already been suspended for duty and officials are still determining whether they will suspend the fourth person. Earlier this month it was announced the navy would take action against eight sailors following these allegations. The eight personnel would be given a chance to respond to claims made against them and some could face expulsion while others only warnings. Now four will face military court over the bizarre and inappropriate allegations.","The navy revealed four people involved in claims of inappropriate conduct will face court martial .

"By . Tamara Abraham . The UK edition of Elle has come under fire for its latest cover, which features Pharrell Williams sporting a feathered headdress. Thousands of social media users have branded the photo 'disrespectful' and 'racist' because the traditional feather headpiece is a sacred symbol for Native Americans. Within hours of the July issue's release, people had taken to both Pharrell's and the Elle UK Facebook pages, sharing their anger with the hashtag 'nothappy', in reference to the singer's recent hit, Happy. Disrespectful? The UK edition of Elle has come under fire from Native Americans for its latest cover, which features Pharrell Williams sporting a feathered headdress . One user wrote: 'Bad move Elle... very disrespectful, he has no business wearing that.' Another posted: 'Please stop your stylists from exploiting native culture on photo shoots. You should know better.' And from a third furious user: 'Are you kidding me? This is the most disturbing overtly racist, disrespectful cooptation of a cultural object.' Feathered headdresses, or war bonnets were historically worn by Native American chiefs and . warriors who received feathers for heroic deeds. Each feather signifies an individual deed, however its primary role, according to Wikipedia, is to protect the wearer. Eagle feathers were typically favored by Native Americans, and the most highly-honored warriors were required to hunt their own birds. While the days of battle are long gone for the Native Americans, the feather headdress is still considered a sacred . item and continues to be used for some ceremonies. Others took the opportunity to educate about the meaning of a feather headdress. One Facebook user, Ruth Rose, explained: 'The headdress is sacred, it was worn by those who were revered and chosen to lead the people. It's not meant to be a fancy headdress for trendsetting.' Another, Eric Garcia, likened it to a misuse of the Medal of Honor, America's highest military honor. 'The warbonnet is equivalent . to the Medal of Honor,' he wrote. 'Would you appreciate it if a foreign nation had . photos of people with that medal on?' Yesterday, Pharrell issued an apology via a representative to the New York Daily News. He said: 'I respect and honor every kind of race, background and culture. I am genuinely sorry.' The image is a second, limited-edition cover that has been published in addition to one featuring Keira Knightley. It was initially posted on the Elle UK website with the words: 'We persuaded ELLE Style Award winner Pharrell to trade his Vivienne . Westwood mountie hat for a native American feather headdress in his best . ever shoot.' Sorry: Pharrell, pictured on The Today Show this morning, issued an apology via his rep . On form: The singer certainly looked 'Happy' as he performed at Rockefeller Plaza . 'Offensive mockery': Chanel's white feather headdresses at a show in Dallas in December last year sparked outrage among Native American activists . And while the publication is yet to respond to MailOnline's request for comment, those particular words have since been removed. Retailers Victoria's Secret, Urban Outfitters and H&M, as well as the band No Doubt have apologised in recent years for using Native American dress as fashion statements. And a Chanel show in December last year was branded an 'offensive mockery' for dressing models in feather headdresses.","The traditional feather headpiece is sacred for Native Americans .

'I always think a good few inches chop makes hair look thicker and healthier,' she told MailOnline. 'Pippa's long locks were starting to look stringy so I like the new do! This cut gives more structure to her . cheekbones which looked a lot rounder with lengthier locks and I'm . loving the extra highlight she added to her make-up to accentuate them. Daily Mail columnist Liz Jones is also a fan of Pippa's haircut, calling it 'edgy' and 'more modern'. 'I love her haircut!' she said. 'It is edgy, it makes her look younger, and it means she has stepped out of Kate's rather ""Dallas"" hair do shadow. Time for a change: Pippa pictured in September last year with her longer hair . Sibling likeness: Pippa's previous long dark locks served to heighten her resemblance to sister Kate . Pride and joy: The Duchess of Cambridge is regularly praised for her glossy brunette waves . 'The big hair look is very old . fashioned, and safe, and tends to drag down the face under its weight. Unlike Kate's hair, which is layered, and has subtle highlights, Pippa's . cut is all one length, and all one colour, which is far more modern.' Pippa's previous hairstyle only . heightened the resemblance between her and her famous sister, so it may . be the case that this new look is an attempt to carve a separate . identity. Indeed, Jones added: 'This new shorter style is a show of confidence, too. It shows she is going to plough her own furrow.' She would not be . the first to go for such a hairstyle though.

Chop chop: Jerry Hall cut her hair in February (left) while Emma Roberts also wears shoulder-length locks (right) But, Wood suggests, Pippa could benefit from a few layers as well as some new styling products to give the cut shape. 'I . do think she could benefit with a few shaggy layers in the front like . Nicole Richie's, as Pippa has a long forehead and this style draws focus . to it,' she explained. 'Or maybe adding a little more texture with some . Bumble & Bumble Surf Spray or some volume using a product like . Phyto's new root lift spray.' And celebrity hair stylist John Barrett, of the John Barrett salon at Bergdorf Goodman, believes Pippa should take the cut even shorter, and try a fringe too. Happy: Pippa seemed in great spirits with her new hair . 'I would be more adventurous and take her hair a little shorter at the back and do wispy bangs,' he told MailOnline. 'This will make her look more current and will give her more options. Right now, Pippa's style is at an in-between stage and I believe that it is crucial that she has a true hairstyle that is effortless, sensual and casual.'

Unhappily married: Nissa, from Beaumont, Texas, says her relationship with Chuck, 46, has manifested into something more akin to that of a carer-patient . She told the show: 'Marriage is extremely difficult when you're married to someone who is 600lbs. We don't have an intimate relationship - our marriage is much more caregiver-patient.' Nissa says that taking care of their toddler son Nathan single-handedly also puts a big strain on her. 'Being a single mom is one thing,' she explains. 'But being a single mom when there's another human being there is much harder.' For his part, Chuck feels immensely guilty that he cannot be the husband that he feels his wife deserves.

'When I met Chuck he was around . 600lbs,' Nissa recalls. 'He was very shy and didn't want to get out of the truck and . introduce himself properly because of his size.

"By . Tamara Abraham . Growing out bangs can be a tedious process that can leave one with months of bad hair days. Not for Michelle Obama though, who has been using headbands made from hosiery to keep her locks in place. The $46 headbands made from stretchy 97 per cent nylon and 3 per cent elastane, come from luxury label Wolford. The brand's style and fit expert, Jenny Altman, told WWD that Mrs Obama has long been a fan of the Fatal headbands. Looking polished: Michelle Obama is a huge fan of the Wolford Fatal headbands and has even had the label customize them for her with crystals and exclusive colorways .

University vs University of Akron college basketball game in Honolulu, . Hawaii (left) and at a yoga class in Miami, Florida, on February 25 (right) I'm all for designer accessories, but I had never considered the basic headband a luxury item. Then again, I had never considered wearing one outside of the gym. This is no ordinary headband though. Like Wolford tights, it is very soft, stretchy and machine washable. The black is an inky hue that won't fade with wear, and it doesn't slide out of place on the head - highly annoying during a spin class. Is it worth $46 though? I'm not sure it is. It's a small amount of fabric given that a whole pair of Wolford Velvet de Luxe 66 denier tights (94% nylon and 6% elastane) costs a dollar less. 'Michelle Obama likes to wear the . headbands when she’s traveling because it’s so easy to just pull your . hair back and look stylish,' Ms Altman revealed. Now Wolford has been working with Mrs . Obama's styling team on customizing the bands in a wider selection of . colors and decorating them with crystals. While the brand only sells plain black and white bands on its website and in its stores, Mrs Obama now has 'sparkle' versions in black, mocha, pine needle green, gray and marlin blue. A representative for the label said: 'As per her request, we custom-made jeweled headbands for Michelle . Obama in a variety of colors in December 2013.' Those wishing to get their hands on a sparkly version, though, will have to stick on the crystals themselves. 'The jeweled . headbands are not available for purchase at this time,' she said.","The headbands are made from stretchy 97 per cent nylon and 3 per cent elastane, and come from luxury label Wolford ."

"By . Tamara Abraham . Beyonce's showstopping new body was the subject of both awe and controversy at last night's Grammy awards. Now a top celebrity trainer has revealed how the singer, 32, got a leaner and slimmer shape without losing her curves. Nicole Winhoffer, who counts Madonna among her clients, says that the trick is to work the muscles in a 360 degree-motion rather than a linear one. New body: Beyonce looked leaner than ever at the Grammys last night - but hasn't lost her famous curves . Trick of the trade: Celebrity trainer Nicole Winhoffer says the secret to a curvy-yet-lean body like Beyonce is to work the muscles in a 360 degree-motion rather than a linear one . She told MailOnline: 'Shaping the muscles at 360 degrees is . important to maintain a feminine figure, rather than the conventional . linear motion you see by using machines at gyms.' Also contributing to Beyonce's new body, no doubt, is the 22-day vegan challenge she embarked on with husband Jay-Z in December. Leaner look: Ms Winhoffer says Beyonce's body at the Super Bowl last year (left) was more muscly - her appearance yesterday (right) represents a marked change in her body shape .

'She . was able to keep her V shape while maintaining her rear, keeping it . plump and lifted.' She says this new silhouette is the holy grail for a female client. 'This is the secret to any weight loss success. Slimming down while staying curvy.' And Ms Winhoffer, a former dancer, has done exactly that with Madonna, who she has trained for the past five years. Since the pair have been working together, Madonna's body has become less muscly and more lean. 'This is my hope for every female I work . with,' she says. 'To embrace and own who you are. Movement frees the body and . results follow, this is my mission for fitness.' While Beyonce drew plenty . of praise for her body following her Drunk In Love performance last night, many were . distressed that she showed quite so much of it. Thousands . of concerned parents across the U.S. slammed her routine and . lingerie-inspired outfit as too risque for children after it aired at 8pm on both coasts and at 7pm central time.

"By . Tamara Abraham . The teenage star of The Girl With Half a Face has undergone surgery to transform her appearance. Sarah Atwell, 17, from Nova Scotia, Canada, was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis at eight months old, a genetic condition that has caused a large tumor to consume the right side of her face. Now, in a one-hour documentary that will air tonight on Discovery Fit & Health, Sarah is seen undergoing a four-hour procedure that will change her life. Recovering: Sarah Atwell, 17, in hospital after surgery to remove an aggressive tumor on the right side of her face. Already we can see how her smile is straighter . While the results from the surgery remain to be seen this evening, Sarah has revealed that she is delighted by the results. Describing the moment that she looked in the mirror for the first time, she told Fox News: 'I . was pretty happy, because I had straight lips. 'I kept . looking in the mirror and taking pictures of myself. My mom and . neighbors were shocked.  We sent my dad pictures, and he was really . happy.  He said as long as I'm happy, he's happy.' But the surgery was not without serious risk of blood loss - a fact that Sarah was all too aware of. The documentary shows her anxiously waiting at the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre with her mother beforehand as her surgeon, Dr Steven Morris, maps the skin he will remove from her face. Bullied: Sarah, from Nova Scotia, Canada, was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis at eight months old, a genetic condition that has caused a large tumor to consume the right side of her face . Afflicted: Sarah, pictured as a toddler (left) and at age eight (right) says her tumor grew with her as she grew . 'The principle . of our surgical approach is to maintain normal tissue so the skin is . fairly normal,' he said. 'The nerves are very abnormal, so [typically] there might be a fine wisp of a nerve fiber, but when it . grows in neurofibromatosis, it might be as big as a pencil. So we're . trying to maintain normal nerve function and trying to preserve normal . structure.' The plastic surgeon admitted that Sarah's tumor was an extreme case. 'When she first came to see me, the lesion . really occupied the whole of her right face; it was growing all around . her eye,' he said. School 'sucks': Discovery Fit & Health also records some of the bullying that Sarah experiences at school, such as classmates repeatedly ripping down her class photo and the abusive names she gets called on a daily basis . Support: Sarah pictured outside her home with her mother Tara . 'She'd had a couple of previous de-bulking . procedures, but [the tumor] went from her nose to the ear on the right, . and the skin hung down off of her jawbone. It was an enormous . overgrowth of abnormal tissue.' While the most significant surgical procedure has now taken place, the work to Sarah's face is not yet over. Nor can surgeons promise that the tumor won't grow back. 'The . next procedure will be to de-bulk the tumor around her eye,' Dr Morris . said. 'Her eye had some sight in it, but it wasn't a great amount of . sight. The tough challenge is what to do with eye and reshape the eye . socket.' Emotional: Sarah conquered at least part of the pain associated with her disfigurement with a 2012 YouTube video in which she hit out at her bullies . Sarah, who has been badly bullied her whole life, initially shot to fame in 2012 after posting a video to Facebook in which . she made her intentions to live a happy life clear no matter what the . bullies called her. In a series of cards held up to the camera, she says: 'I have a tumor, that’s all. . . I wish people could understand there is nothing wrong with me. Another reads: 'I get called names all the time. . . Bitch, slut, fat face, fat, ugly - it hurts. ‘Maybe one day the bullying will stop, but until then I’m going to be STRONG,’ one of the last cards says. The impact of that post was bigger than she could have ever imagined. Fighting back: Sarah posted a video on Facebook in which she . reveals how the cruel and hurtful taunts she hears at school have affected her . Revealing her pain: At 16, she'd had enough. 'I was tired of being bullied and I put in on Facebook' she said . Trying to stay strong: Sarah's touching candor won her millions of internet fans almost overnight . ‘The next day I got up and my inbox was over 1,000 messages or more from people,’ Sarah told ABC News. ‘It felt pretty good.’ Neurofibromatosis is the name for a number of genetic conditions that cause swellings or lumps. Although many people who have the condition inherit it from one of their parents, up to 50 per cent develop it randomly from a gene mutation before they are born. Despite their alarming appearance, the growths and swellings - called neurofibromas and caused by a growth of cells - are not cancerous or contagious. The condition has long been associated with the ‘Elephant Man,’ the name given to Joseph Carey Merrick, who was severely disfigured.However, in 1986, a new theory emerged that Mr Merrick may actually have had Proteus syndrome, a condition which involves symptoms such as abnormal growth of the bones, skin and head. The confusion was again compounded in 2001 when it was proposed that he had suffered from a combination of neurofibromatosis type one (NF1) and Proteus syndrome. However, DNA tests on his hair and bones have proven inconclusive. Among . those viewers was a producer from . Discovery, and so began the TV documentation of the young girl’s life. Of her tumor, she says: 'It grew with me as I grew. In my right ear, it's kinda hard to hear sometimes, because [the tumor] pulls everything down. And my right eye, it's just blur.' Discovery Fit & Health also records some of the bullying that Sarah experiences at school, such as classmates repeatedly ripping down her class photo and the abusive names she gets called on a daily basis. 'Almost every day at school sucks,' she admits. 'My class photo keeps going missing. Someone takes it, I don't know why. And it hurts. . . 'There's some kids that will call me names and threaten to kill me. . .' Her teacher, Sarah Lockhart, echoed this. 'Sarah's been bullied most of her life - being called names, being made fun of,' she said. 'She keeps to herself, but we do know that it does affect her life every day.' Sarah laid bare her feelings in a video diary, by way of a coping mechanism, and from there, her viral YouTube/Facebook post was a natural step forward. Sarah . says that she hopes to have a career where she can work with children, and particularly to help those who experience bullying. ‘If . I could stand up to bullying, and if another kid who was bullied sees . me and thinks they can talk to someone and think, ""I can stand up for . myself,"" then I have helped,’ she said.","Sarah Atwell, 17, from Nova Scotia, Canada has neurofibromatosis, a rare disease that causes a tumor to grow on half her face .

"By . Tamara Abraham . Lena Dunham is pictured posing in a polka dot Burberry shirt for her very first Vogue cover. The 27-year-old is hailed The New Queen of Comedy in the February issue, and sees her interview take place during the filming of season three, which premiered on Sunday. But the fact that it is just a head-shot rather than a full-body image may raise questions about the U.S. glossy's attitude towards larger body shapes. Cover girl: Lena Dunham pictured on the cover of the February issue of U.S. Vogue . Regardless, Miss Dunham looks sensational on the Annie Leibovitz-shot cover. And an inside shot does pay tribute to the curves that she is so fiercely proud of. In any case, it seems the star is very proud of the results, as she tweeted a link this morning with the words: 'Dear @voguemagazine: Thank you. Love, Lena.' The interview sees Miss Dunham share insights into her rise to fame, her on-screen alter-ego's nudity, and her relationship with Fun's Jack Antonoff. The couple were set up on a blind date by his sister, designer Rachel Antonoff, and admits falling for him came as something of a surprise. Vogue's candid interview sees Miss Dunham share insights into her rise to fame, her on-screen alter-ego's nudity, and her relationship with Fun's Jack Antonoff . 'I’d been like, If I never date again . in my whole life, I’ll be fine with it! I want to work and rescue . rabbits and be a notable eccentric!' she said. 'I had a whole romantic . idea about singledom, and then, of course, that’s the moment when you . meet someone that you really care about.' Miss Dunham also opens up about her attitude to fashion, which is far more sophisticated than her on-screen image as Hanna Horvath. In fact, she learned about style early on, as one of her babysitters was none other than the designer of her Golden Globes dress - Zac Posen. Mr Posen even made her high school graduation dress. Fashion moment: The star is very proud of the results, as she tweeted a link this morning with the words: 'Dear @voguemagazine: Thank you. Love, Lena' Of her other favorite designers, she continues: 'I’ve always loved Comme des Garçons; I’ve always loved Yohji Yamamoto. I’m into Charlotte Olympia flats. I really love a Prada bag because they always have one weird detail that you didn’t think about. I always wear J Brand jeans because the waist is high . . . a low-cut jean is a problematic thing for me.' MailOnline revealed that Miss Dunham had landed the coveted spot earlier this month.

York earlier this month. Girls night out: Lena Dunham and Anna Wintour posed on the red carpet together at the season three premiere of the hit HBO series on January 6 . Friends in fashionable places: Zac Posen, who designed Lena Dunham's dress for the Golden Globes on Sunday, was actually her babysitter when she was a child . Miss Dunham has famously been forced to defend her pride in her body. Howard Stern called her a 'little fat chick' last year, and Judd Apatow reveals that she was 'delighted' by the label. But beyond being an inspiration to the masses of women who don't fit the supermodel physical idea, the star says there is immense purpose to each nude scene scripted into Girls. 'Seeing somebody who looks like you . having sex on television is a less comfortable experience than seeing . somebody who looks like nobody you’ve ever met' 'There was a sense that I and many women I knew had been led astray by Hollywood and television depictions of sexuality,' she explained. 'Seeing somebody who looks like you having sex on television is a less comfortable experience than seeing somebody who looks like nobody you’ve ever met.' On another scandal that broke during season two following an episode in which Hannah has a weekend-long fling with a handsome doctor played by Patrick Wilson, Miss Dunham was stunned that viewers found it so controversial. 'Critics said, ""That guy . wouldn’t date that girl!""' she recalled. 'It’s like, ""Have you been out . on the street lately?"" Everyone dates everyone, for lots of reasons we . can’t understand. Sexuality isn’t a perfect puzzle, like, ""He has a nice . nose and she has a nice nose! She’s got great breasts and he’s got . great calves. . ."" It’s a complicated . thing. I want people ultimately, even if they’re disturbed by certain . moments, to feel bolstered and normalized by the sex that’s on the . show.' Showstopping: The Girls cast, from left: Zosia Mamet in Saint Laurent, Lena Dunham in Rochas, Jemima Kirke in Geminola and Allison Williams in Christian Dior . Anna Wintour's presence at the Girls . season three premiere on January 6 was a major hint that Miss Dunham . would appear on the Vogue cover. The Vogue editor-in-chief, who wore a colorful Prada fur coat from the same collection that Lena wears in the issue, attended theevent with her daughter Bee Shaffer - a big fan of Girls. She was extremely friendly with the cast, and posed on the red carpet with Lena. She also gave Alison Williams a big hug and a kiss once inside the venue. But this is not actually Miss . Dunham's first time in Vogue. In 1998, the magazine reveals, she . featured as an 11-year-old in a spread about 'a New York pack of . fashion-conscious kids'.

I view him as a clothesmonger.' Controversial: Vogue's decision to use just a head-shot of Miss Dunham on its cover threatens to escalate into a similar controversy that surrounded Mindy Kaling's new Elle cover . Vogue's decision to use just a head-shot of Miss Dunham on the cover, however, threatens to escalate into a similar controversy that surrounded Mindy Kaling's new Elle cover. While her fellow comedienne insisted that she loved the cover, critics attacked Elle because Miss Kaling is only celebrated with a head shot, while Amy Poehler, Zooey Deschanel and Allison Williams are shown in color and nearly full-length. Fashionista observed that 'at a a self-proclaimed size 8, [Ms Kaling] is hardly ""plus size"" — [but] gets a close-cropped image.' Many fans also took to Twitter to voice their opinions. Danielle Odiamar tweeted: '*sigh* @mindykaling's gorgeous skin and curves deserve better.'

"By . Lauren Lumsden . One of the most cherished old buildings in Manhattan - a tiny wooden farmhouse nestled between highrises - might get torn down to make way for condos. The 1,000-square-foot home, which is at 121 Charles St. in the storied West Village neighborhood, has been listed as a 'development site' priced at $20 million. Preservationists are outraged, saying that anyone who tries to demolish the house will 'have a mighty fight on their hands,' reports the Daily News. Little white house! The home at 121 Charles St. might get torn down to make way for a larger development . Very inviting: The little farmhouse stands out among all the larger apartment buildings around it . 'This is one of the most beloved and historic corners of the Village,' said Andrew Berman, of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation. 'We and many others would fight very hard to keep it that way.' The building's owner, Suri Bieler, who is behind the sale and refused to comment, chose to list it exclusively with ERG Property Advisors, a Manhattan-based commercial real estate firm. She bought it in 1988. Ms Bieler, who is president of a prop-styling company, told The New York Times in 2008 that she had 'pined for the . house since she was a child in the 1960s, when she spotted it from the . back of her parents' station wagon.' She said people frequently send her old pictures of the property, evidence of its sentimental value to New Yorkers. Don't tear it down! The official listing for the house mentions the lot only, which it says is perfect for boutique condominiums . The house sits at the corner of Greenwich and Charles Sts. in Manhattan's idyllic Greenwich Village neighborhood . Though Ms Bieler wouldn't tell the Times what she bought it for, a previous owner said she sold it to someone in 1986 for $725,000. The farmhouse was built during the 1800s and, interestingly, it was originally located on the Upper East Side. It was moved by trucks down Second Avenue in 1967 to avoid demolition by the Archdiocese of New York, which wanted to replace it with senior housing. There's a house in the middle of the street! The home was originally located on the Upper East Side, but moved in 1967 to avoid demolition . Another tidbit: Margaret Wise Brown, author of the popular childhood book 'Goodnight Moon' lived in the house during the 1940s. The property's listing calls its 5,000-square-foot lot a 'large blank canvas for a developer or user to execute a wide variety of potential visions, from boutique condominiums, apartments, or a one-of-a-kind family residence.' There is no mention of the farmhouse.","The property is listed at $20million .

"By . Olivia Fleming . When 12-year-old Kayla Roncin, Central New Jersey's star player for Toms River Little League baseball team, blasts a home run she makes sure to chant 'girl power' as she makes her way around the field. But the first baseman, relief pitcher, spot starter and Toms River's best hitter won't have that chance for much longer. Kayla's baseball career has a . shelf life, so she is reluctantly starting to get used to her future sport: softball. 'I know she can keep up with those boys,' her mom, Linda Roncin, told The New York Post. 'I don’t understand, why can’t a girl play baseball? Why is it a big deal?' 12-year-old Kayla Roncin, Central New Jersey's star player for Toms River Little League baseball team, pictured with her mom, Linda, after a home run (courtesy of Asbury Park Press) Kayla, who stands tall at 5ft and 8in, has been playing baseball since she was five years old, when her father, Ray, signed . her up. Toms River manager, Pete Avallone, says even then she was better than 95per cent of the boys, and his son, Tyler, an outfielder for Toms River, agrees. 'People don’t expect a girl to be . playing baseball with a bunch of boys, and she’s one of the best on the . team,' Tyler explained. 'She definitely surprises people with everything she does -- . hitting, pitching and fielding.' Pete Avallone admitted that when he picked Kayla -- who has a personal pitching coach and . batting instructor -- for the team, her male teammates were initially 'shocked', but they quickly came around. 'People don't expect a girl to be playing baseball with a bunch of boys, and she's one of the best on the team,' said her teammate, Tyler.

'She’s treated no differently than the . boys on the team. They make fun of her and she gives it right back to . them,' he explained. However there are some players and coaches who laugh when Kayla walks onto the field - something that doesn't seen to rattle her, or her teammates. 'We’re happy, because we know for a fact . she will prove them wrong and show them how good she is,' Tyler said. 'I think that motivates her to do better and prove them wrong. When they . do that, we know she’s going to show them right up.' Pete Avallone admitted that when he picked Kayla for the team four years ago, her male teammates were initially 'shocked' - but they quickly came around . Toms River is one of six teams . in Bristol, Connecticut to make the Mid-Atlantic Regional -- . mainly thanks to Kayla. The fact she has just one more year left on the . field before she will transition into Junior League Softball makes her . 'sad', she said, but she knows she must 'move on'. 'This could be my last time around, so . I want to do the best I can. I really want to win it all so badly.' Kayla's family has already begun looking into high level fast-pitch travel softball teams for Kayla, despite their reluctance to have her quit baseball. 'I think you’re taking the biggest part of her away if she has . to [quit baseball],' said Linda. 'I can’t even, at this point, fathom that. She just . loves the sport. I can’t even tell you how much, and if she’s not . playing it, she’s watching it. That’s gonna be a really tough transition . for her.' Forty years ago, Little League Baseball allowed girls, for the first time, to participate in the world's largest organized youth sports program. A 1973 ruling by Sylvia Pressler, hearing examiner for the New Jersey Civil Rights Division, was upheld in the New Jersey Superior Court a year later, leading to Little League Baseball's admittance of girls into its programs. Until then, Little League regulations had prohibited girls from participating, and the World Series regulations even featured the clause: 'Girls are not eligible under any conditions.' Now, approximately 150,000 girls play in Little League Baseball, and ten girls have participated in the Little League World Series. However, there were only 859 girls playing high school baseball in 2010, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations. Chelsea Baker, a 17-year-old junior at Durant High School in Plant City, Florida, hopes to be the third girl to be chosen for a college baseball team this year. In 2011, Marti Sementelli, from California, received a combination academic-baseball scholarship to Montreat College, which is part of the NCAA, in North Carolina. And Ghazaleh Sailors, a junior pitcher and backup second baseman for the University of Maine-Presque Isle, is the only woman playing baseball in the NCAA in 2014. Miss Sailors was forced to switch high schools after enduring harassment from her baseball teammates because of her gender. She told The Bangor Daily News earlier this year: 'I’ve gotten death threats over the internet. That was pretty scary.'

"By . John Stevens . and Steph Cockroft . Support for Ukip has crumbled in the‎ wake of its European election victory, a new opinion poll suggests today. The party has fallen back to single figures to be on nine per cent, down seven points from 16 per cent last month. Nigel Farage’s party has failed to advance since it became ‎the first party other than Labour or the Tories to come first in a British national election in modern political history in May. Scroll down for video . David Cameron's Tory party appears to be picking up Ukip deserters, after Nigel Farage's party dropped seven percentage points in the latest opinion poll to drop back into single figures, while Tories take the lead . It spells good news for the established Westminster parties, including the Tories who have gone into the lead in the poll. According to the Guardian/ICM poll, Ukip has gone into reverse with the Tories gaining the most of the defectors, up three points to 34 percent. Labour gained one point to to 33 per cent and the Lib Dems went up two to 12 per cent. The party’s advance started to flounder weeks after its European election win when it failed to take the Newark by-election. The seat was held by the Tories in June. But the poll also shows that support for the Conservative and Labour parties - who are separated by just one point - is almost at a dead heat. It is the third month running that the two parties have had virtually the same number of points. Ed Miliband's Labour are one point behind the Tories with 33 per cent - the third month that the two parties have been virtually the same . Martin Boon, director at ICM Research, said: ‘We used to talk about parties getting themselves through the “magic” 40 per cent threshold before they would be in serious contention to win, but less than a year before a general election, both the big parties are currently struggling to get themselves into the middle 30s, which, of course, only the Tories managed in 2010.’ Mr Boon also suggested that Ukip's apparent decline in popularity is fairly normal for parties who are propelled into the limelight during mid-term elections. He said the party dropped to a similar extent - from 18 per cent to 12 per cent - from May to June last year. Meanwhile, according to the Guardian, the polls shows there are not many factors separating the two more popular parties in the current polls. Support from men and women is evenly spread across both parties, reflecting a change from previous years which showed a far lower number of women voting for the Conservatives. Tories also appear to have a fairly even spread of voters from across the demographic, with 30 per cent voting from the lowest DE occupational grade and 34 per cent from the AB professionals. But results for the leading party are still uneven when it comes to age and the regions where people vote. More than half (52 per cent) of the over-65s are still more likely to vote Tory. The party also appears to have much less support in Scotland (21 per cent), Wales (18 per cent) and the north (21 per cent), compared with the Midlands, where it has 46 per cent.","Tories pick up voters in opinion poll after Nigel Farage's party drops to 9% .

"By . John Stevens . Stephen Crabb has become the first Conservative cabinet minister with a beard for more than a century after being promoted to Welsh Secretary. A bearded Tory has not sat at the cabinet table since William Hillier Onslow, the 4th Earl of Onslow, who was president of the board of agriculture from 1903 to 1905. Mr Crabb, who is the MP for Preseli Prembrokeshire and was first elected in 2005, has neatly trimmed facial hair, which is in contrast to Lord Onslow’s fuller whiskers. Scroll down for video . Stephen Crabb's promotion to Welsh Secretary makes him the first hirsute man in Cabinet since William Hillier Onslow, the 4th Earl of Onslow . William Hillier Onslow, the 4th Earl of Onslow, held several governmental positions between 1880 and 1905 and was also Governor of New Zealand between 1889 and 1892 . The 41-year-old replaces David Jones who was sacked in the reshuffle. Mr Crabb had been his deputy at the Wales Office and was previously a government whip. The father-of-two was raised by a single parent in a council house. Before election, he worked as a marketing consultant. As he emerged from No 10 Downing Street yesterday he said he was ‘very pleased’ with his new job but ducked a question about how it felt to be the first Tory cabinet minister with a beard for more than 100 years. The Beard Liberation Front, which campaigned against New Labour politicians removing their facial hair in a bid to boost their image, welcomed his appointment. Organiser Keith Flett said: ‘A beard in the cabinet is long overdue.’ The Tory party has previously been accused of pognophobia. Margaret Thatcher reportedly said she ‘wouldn’t tolerate any minister of mine wearing a beard’. The last prime minister with a beard was Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, the 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, who resigned in 1902. Labour has had several bearded Cabinet ministers in recent years, including David Blunkett (left) and Frank Dobson who both served under Tony Blair . There have been many bearded Cabinet ministers in the Labour party including Robin Cook, Charles Clarke and David Blunkett. But Alistair Darling shaved off his beard reportedly on the advice of image consultants. Last year Jeremy Paxman prompted a debate on beards after he returned from a holiday to present Newsnight with a beard. Mr Crabb was welcomed to his new role by Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones, who described him as ‘pragmatic and reasonable’. Andrew RT Davies, the Tory leader in the Welsh Assembly, said: 'Stephen Crabb has been an effective and hardworking minister and will be a powerful advocate for Wales around the Cabinet table. 'I congratulate my close colleague Stephen Crabb on his promotion.' Shortly after his appointment Mr Crabb paid tribute to his predecessor. He tweeted: ‘I will build on the excellent work of David Jones. ‘He achieved so much during his time as Welsh secretary & leaves a strong legacy to Wales.’ In further tweets, he added: ‘Wales deserves the best and I look forward to providing a strong voice for Wales around the Cabinet table. ‘This Gov is ambitious for Wales, working to ensure Wales at front of the economic recovery.’","Stephen Crabb promoted to Welsh Secretary in wide-ranging reshuffle .

"By . John Stevens . Rebuttal: John Bercow, with his wife Sally, has had previous clashes with MPs . Commons Speaker John Bercow was yesterday accused of driving Parliament’s most senior official to resign by treating him badly and swearing at him. In an extraordinary intervention in the chamber, Conservative MP Michael Fabricant said that the Clerk of the House was retiring early after Mr  Bercow used the F-word. The Speaker immediately denied the allegation about Sir Robert Rogers, saying: ‘I’ll ignore that last observation which suffered from the disadvantage of being wrong.’ But Mr Fabricant stood by the claim, declaring he does not believe things should be ‘swept under the carpet’. The Lichfield MP made the assertion under Parliamentary privilege during a motion to mark Sir Robert’s retirement this summer after a 42-year career in Parliament. It has previously been suggested that the 64-year-old is leaving early because of a difficult relationship with Mr Bercow. Sir Robert, who has a £200,000 salary and grace-and-favour home, is the arbiter of the rules of debate. He sits at a desk facing the Speaker’s Chair at part of every sitting in the Commons. In his prepared speech, Mr  Fabricant told MPs: ‘Our clerk is one of the most popular we have had and, certainly in my 23 years, I can say that’s probably the case. ‘His cheerful disposition, often under difficult circumstances, has been an illumination to many of us and his detailed knowledge of  procedure is important.' Sir Roberts Rogers is standing down as clerk of the Commons, ending a 42-year Parliamentary career . He added: ‘So this clerk will be sorely missed by . the House and by me. We don’t know why he has chosen to retire early, . though his working environment behind closed doors has not always been . easy, as those in the know have already alluded.’ The MP continued, . spelling out the swear word: ‘In that respect, despite Sir Robert having . studied Anglo-Saxon at Oxford and being told at least once in front of . others to F.*.*.* off by you Mr Speaker, I think that wouldn’t have . encouraged him to stay.’ Last night, Mr Fabricant, who is known as a flamboyant and often outspoken MP, defended his claim.‘I . got this from witnesses,’ he said. ‘I’ve heard of this type of thing . happening more than once. A very well-known member of the Establishment, . with a capital “E”, was present and was very shocked. This is a knight . of the shires, a very well-known person, but no one directly to do with . the Commons. ‘I asked him “did he really say that?” I couldn’t believe it.’ Mr Fabricant was the last to be called in the motion and left the chamber after giving his speech.‘I . said it, then I left and bowed at him [Mr Bercow] as I left the chamber . because I respect his position, if not him personally,’ he said. ‘A . number of colleagues came up and congratulated me and said it was a . brave thing to do. A Labour MP said it was not the appropriate place to . say it, but when I asked “where was” she could not answer. ‘I do believe these things should not be swept under the carpet. We know what happens when that occurs.’ Tory MP Michael Fabricant claimed Mr Bercow had told Sir Robert Rogers to 'f*** off' There have been previous confrontations between Mr Fabricant and Mr Bercow, who had proved unpopular with some Tories. The MP has claimed Mr Bercow does not treat him well in the chamber and will often call him last during debates. But yesterday Mr Fabricant strongly denied making the comments to get back at the Speaker. ‘This . is not revenge at all,’ he said. ‘I do not do revenge, that is far too . childish.

"By . Tamara Abraham . A former child star has filed a lawsuit against Vogue over the music used on a behind-the-scenes video for its Kim Kardashian and Kanye West cover shoot. Ohio-based Ricky Spicer, 56, who was the 12-year-old lead singer of Seventies soul group The Ponderosa Twins Plus One, claims that the glossy magazine used West's Bound 2 track that contains unauthorized samples of his voice.

"Many DIY sunscreens contain oils that actually speed up burning . By . Lauren Lumsden . Dermatologists are issuing harsh warnings against making your own sunblock, as hundreds of DIY formulas make their way around the internet. Many bloggers who post the recipes claim that store-bought sunscreens contain harsh chemicals that could be as bad - if not worse - for you than the sun. But doctors say there's no way to guarantee homemade concoctions offer broadband protection (that is, shield against wrinkle-inducing UVA rays as well as cancer-causing UVB-rays), or ensure that the SPF is high enough. Ouch! Doctors say that if you make your own sunscreen there's no way to guarantee yourself protection from harsh UVA and UVB rays . New York-based dermatologist Whitney Bowe told MailOnline that making and using your own sunscreen is 'effectively putting your skin at risk for melanoma.' 'Sunscreen companies invest millions of dollars formulating and testing sunscreens to ensure they are stable and effective,' she says. 'Sunscreen companies invest millions of dollars formulating and testing sunscreens to ensure they are stable and effective' 'Tests are conducted in the lab and on humans to ensure they provide broad-spectrum protection and that the ingredients remain stable and active when mixed together and exposed to heat and sun.' A quick Google or Pinterest search shows that many of the recipes call for various oils - like coconut, almond, rosehip and carrot seed oils - which can actually promote sunburns. Joshua Zeichner, another dermatologist in New York, explained to Allure that oils 'can actually absorb light, making UV rays penetrate the skin more.' 'That has the same effect as greasing up with baby lotion when you go to the beach,' he said. But even if you do use the right ingredients, like zinc oxide, cosmetic chemists say there is an art to mixing them together, and if you do it wrong - which chances are you will - the sunscreen will be ineffective. So, despite all these warnings against it, why are bloggers still trying to make their own? They say that many of the store-bought brands contain harsh chemicals that can actually alter your hormones. Their argument might not be completely without merit. Arthur Perry, a New York-based plastic surgeon and Adjunct Associate Professor of Surgery at Columbia University, explained on Doctor Oz's website that chemical sunscreens soak into the skin and get into your bloodstream. Of the 15 chemical sunscreens that exist, nine are considered 'endocrine disruptors,' meaning they interfere with the normal function of hormones. Mr Perry said that the hormones most commonly disturbed include estrogen, progesterone, testosterone and thyroid. This can lead to early puberty and premature breast development in girls, small and undescended testicles in boys, low sperm counts, infertility, breast and ovarian cancers in women, and prostate cancer in men. According to the Environmental Working Group, the ingredients that are most disruptive are: oxybenzone, octinoxate, homosalate, octisalate, and octocrylene. A quick survey of the most commonly found sunscreens in a Duane Reade showed that almost all of them contained one or more of the above. That said, is there a healthy compromise? Are there any store-bought sunscreens without harsh chemicals? New York-based dermatologist Sherry Shieh says yes: 'The chemical-free sunscreens these days are excellent. They're fragrance-free and non-toxic.' 'There is no reason from a safety, cost, or time standpoint to make your own.' Bloggers and doctors generally agree that mineral sunscreens are best; that is, creams where the chief protection is provided by zinc oxide or titanium oxide. Brands that use these minerals include Honest, Sun Stuff, Alba Botanica, Badger, and Climb On. If you do go the natural route, keep in mind that the SPF is usually lower - so you will need to apply more often, as well as every time you get wet.","Doctors say DIY sunscreens don't offer broadband protection .

"By . John Stevens . The former England rugby captain has slammed NHS bosses for their U-turn on funding cancer treatment . Former England rugby captain Lawrence Dallaglio has described NHS bosses as a ‘national disgrace’ for going back on a deal to fund cutting-edge cancer treatment. The sports star, who lost his mother Eileen to cancer in 2008, accused the health service of ‘turning the clock back’ on cancer treatment by refusing to pay for a revolutionary radiotherapy treatment. Stereotatic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) targets beams very precisely at the tumour allowing high doses of radiation to be delivered with less risk of it affecting surrounding organs. Patients on average need only five visits to hospital, rather than the average of 25 for other cancer treatments, and can usually go home the same day. Mr Dallaglio was asked to work with the NHS to devise a plan after he approached David Cameron with concerns that not enough patients had access to the lifesaving treatment. But after health bosses ditched the proposal to give it to an extra 2,000 patients, Mr Dallaglio has accused NHS England of ‘going back on its word’ and written to the Health Secretary to ask him to intervene. In a letter to Jeremy Hunt, Mr Dallaglio said NHS England had ‘savaged’ the availability of the technology ‘the rest of the civilised world uses as a matter of routine’ so only a ‘pitiful number of patients’ would be treated. He wrote: ‘In my view what NHS England is doing now is a national disgrace. While their new chief executive talks about employing 50 new commissioners and focusing on better management structures, our cancer clinicians are denied the use of technologies to treat patients that the rest of the civilised world uses as a matter of routine.’ He added: ‘The way NHS England are approaching this is turning the clock back on the way we’re treating cancer. We’re not just standing still and doing nothing, we’re turning the clock back. It angers me.’ Mr Dallaglio was drafted in after he last year wrote to the Prime Minister to warn that Britain was ‘falling behind the rest of the world’ in the use of advanced radiotherapy. He was asked by Jeremy Hunt to work with NHS England to devise a plan to improve the service and they agreed to a £5million deal to more than double the number of patients treated and extend the types of cancer treated. Dallaglio lost his mother Eileen to cancer in 2008 and has since raised more than £1m for charitable causes . NHS England pledged to conduct clinical trials on using the treatment on spine, liver and pelvis cancers, and ensure it was available in hospitals around Britain. But it has now told Mr Dallaglio that the clinical trials will not take place, it will only treat half the patients it previously pledged and it will not start the work until April. In his letter to Mr Hunt, Mr Dallaglio wrote: ‘It is bad enough that NHS England is going back on its word regarding these patient numbers but we are not even being given a guarantee that the pitiful numbers they are proposing will definitely start being treated in the next financial year. ‘I am surprised that you are allowing all of this to happen under your stewardship.’ In 2012, David Cameron promised that all NHS patients would get ‘innovative radiotherapy where clinically appropriate, safe and cost-effective’. Dallaglio, pictured playing for England and London Wasps in 2008 and 2007 respectively, has slammed the NHS after the organisation backtracked on clinical trials and the number of patients to receive them . New figures compiled by Tessa Munt, the Liberal Democrat MP, show that the number of patients being offered advanced radiotherapy fell by 10 per cent last year. A total of 645 patients were treated in 2012-13 compared to568 in the year to April. Mrs Munt said: ‘This data shows that NHS England is making David Cameron’s promise to increase patient access to innovative radiotherapy into a farce. In contrast to his promise to save more lives, NHS England is simply letting patients die.’ Mr Dallaglio is holding an event in the House of Commons today to try to persuade the government to act. Britain currently ranks third from bottom in the European league table of cancer survival rates. The sportsman, who won the rugby union World Cup in 2003, has become a charity campaigner and raised millions of pounds since launching the Dallaglio Foundation following his mother’s death. Dr Sean Duffy, NHS England’s National Clinical Director For Cancer, last night said: ‘If money were no object it would be great to fund every experimental treatment that we are lobbied on, but that’s not the reality, so instead our priority this year has been investing hundreds of millions of pounds in cancer and other specialised treatments that are actually proven to work for patients.’","Former England rugby captain slams NHS bosses as a 'national disgrace'

"By . Tamara Abraham . Lupita Nyong'o was the uncontested best-dressed - as well as Best Supporting Actress - at the Oscars last night. The 12 Years a Slave actress's baby blue Prada gown stood out in a sea of safe nudes and creams with a look that recalled Alice in Wonderland - right down to the sparkling band atop her head. Jennifer Lawrence also won points for her choice of a strapless, tomato red peplum-waisted gown. As the face of Dior she has the pick of the collection, and she (or rather her stylist) chose well in a selection that not only holds its own in the style stakes, but does not overwhelm the person wearing it. The majority of female attendees, though, wore shimmering columns of pale sequins, which, while pretty and elegant, left us feeling like we'd seen it all before.

Olivia . Wilde, too, looked sensational in a high-necked Valentino gown, made to . accommodate her seven-months baby bump. The cut-out back and the panel . of white gave it a Sixties mod look that is rare at the Oscars, and . refreshing to see.

Of the pale sparkly numbers there were a few that stood out. Naomi Watts, as always, proved that she is one step ahead in the style stakes with a cap-sleeved Calvin Klein gown that was breathtakingly sleek and simple, set off by a statement Bulgari neckpiece, slicked-back hair and deep red lips. Kate Hudson's cape-shouldered Versace . was one of the host highly-rated looks too. The actress does a plunging . neckline like few others, and the covered shoulders were at once strong . and demure.

Adams and Sandra Bullock both looked sensational as always, but their . navy strapless gowns, by Gucci and Alexander McQueen respectively, . made for remarkably similar silhouettes.

And Leslie Mann was a ray of sunshine in her yellow Jenny Packham gown at the Vanity Fair party. Over at Elton John's viewing party, Kim Kardashian was the belle of the ball in Celia Kritharioti. Yes, it exposed a lot of cleavage, but the color was great on her and the ballgown silhouette is one we don't see her wear much. While many of the other stars in attendance at the Oscars played it safe in sparkly white (or variations on the pale hue), they do deserve credit for looking flawless nonetheless. Best Actress winner Cate Blanchett's Armani Prive ballgown was ravishing, and a little racy in that it gave the impression of being almost see-through. Jennifer Garner, too, looked ravishing in her Oscar de La Renta gown with its tiers of silver fringing.

We loved Camila Alves for wearing an unexpected designer - Gabriela Cadena - and looking sensational in the tailored, blush pink creation, and Jenna Dewan Tatum's Reem Acra gown was pure romance. There were some style highlights among the TV presenters too - while most of the attention was on the A-listers, those covering the red carpet arrivals brought their A-game too.

"By . Kate Lyons . and Ryan Lipman . and Zoe Nauman . Natarsha Belling has put on a brave face before presenting doomed breakfast programme Wake Up for the last time. The host of the axed show was spotted on Thursday looking tense and emotional after shooting the second last episode earlier in the day. But Belling is not the only one feeling the pain, with staff who have been told their jobs have been axed as part of Channel Ten’s cut backs being forced to come to work and sit at their desks with nothing to do while decisions are made over whether they have new roles within the ailing TV network. Scroll down for video . Taking its toll: News of Wake Up's axing the day before appears to have had an affect on host Natarsha Belling, who was spotted looking upset with her arms crossed as she walked on a busy footpath in Sydney's eastern suburbs on Thursday . An insider revealed to the Mail Online as the company looks at whether positions can be found for the team on the now defunct Wake Up, which was dumped after just six months on air, the staff are still being made to come into the building every day for the next two weeks. Although they no longer have arrive at 3am – the usual start time for breakfast TV crew, they are being expected to put in a full working day. However with the show now canned, they are left twiddling their thumbs waiting to find out if they are one of the lucky few to be offered a new job. The insider said: 'The atmosphere is pretty bad. Everyone is very down and as you can imagine the last thing they want to do is come into an office and sit at a desk when they have absolutely nothing to do. 'They are trying to put a brave face on things but it’s very tough. It’s not a great place to be right now.' A day earlier Channel Ten confirmed it was axing Wake Up as well as its early, morning and late news bulletins and cutting up to 150 jobs . With the impact taking its toll on the presenter, she was seen with her arms crossed while walking on a busy footpath in Sydney's eastern suburbs - and with the pain of the past 24 hours written all over her face. The 38-year-old was also later spotted walking with a mobile phone in her hand as she clutched onto a pen and piece of paper. Another image shows Belling clenching her hands tightly as she walked, and with her thoughts appearing to be elsewhere. The host's demeanor was in stark contrast to the brave face she put the night before at the InStyle and Audi Women Of Style Awards on Wednesday evening, following news of the axing earlier that day. Contrast: Belling put on a brave face when she attended the the InStyle and Audi Women Of Style Awards on Wednesday night, just hours after Channel Ten announced it was axing Wake Up . Wake Up will air for the last time this morning, with Belling and co-host James Mathison presenting what is expected to be sombre and emotional final episode. Despite Belling learning on Wednesday that Wake Up was due to get the chop, the presenter said she spent the afternoon after the announcement 'eating ice cream' with her sons Harrison and Hugo. 'It's a really sad day for Network 10,' she told the Daily Telegraph. 'I'm heartbroken but I have no regrets because I have put in 110 per cent since day one and you cannot control circumstances that are out of your control.' Natasha Exelby, Natarsha Belling, and James Mathison, were the original co-hosts of Wake Up, which will cease production on Friday . Studio 10's Jessica Rowe also attended the awards on Wednesday night and said she felt sadness for her colleagues at the axed breakfast show. The television presenter said she felt guilty for being dressed up and attending the event, given the grim situation many of her co-workers were facing. 'It's awful, it is awful,' Rowe said of the announcement yesterday that Channel Ten would be axing Wake Up, as well as its early, morning and late news bulletins and cutting up to 150 jobs. 'In a way it kind of feels odd being here all frocked up and smiling when for a lot of people it's bloody awful and it is really sad,' she told The Daily Telegraph. Ms Rowe is one of the hosts of Studio 10, which will remain on air, but she said despite the fact their show had been saved they were not 'happy'. 'Having in the past been through times when I have lost my job, it is not great.' Jessica Rowe said it felt 'odd' to be glammed up for an event on a day when it was announced that up to 150 employees at Channel 10 would be losing their jobs. Wake Up was launched in November 2013, in a bid to compete with Channel Seven's Sunrise and Channel Nine's Today and rumours have been circulating for weeks that the struggling show might be about to get the chop. Wake Up was the brainchild of Sunrise mastermind Adam Boland, and was launched in November 2013, with three hosts, Natasha Exelby, James Mathison, and Natarsha Belling. Just 16-days later, Ms Exelby was cut from the panel, after it was decided the show's chemistry was not working. The last episodes of Wake Up and the 5.30am news bulletin will air on Friday. Channel Ten announced today that their new morning line-up will start on Monday. It will feature cooking show Ready, Steady, Cook at 6am, followed by repeats of Entertainment Tonight and The Bold and The Beautiful. Rounding out the morning is Jamie's 30 Minute meals, which starts at eight. According to a Ten announcement, Jamie's 30 Minute Meals is a first run episode. It has struggled to attract viewers, averaging 30-40,000 per day, around a tenth of the viewers tuning in to Channels Nine and Seven. In his email to staff informing them of the cuts yesterday, Channel Ten CEO, Hamish McLennan stated: 'Wake Up has not resonated with enough viewers to make it a viable program.' The extent of the redundancies are not yet known, but in his email Mr McLennan informed staff that the struggling network will also cut its 5.30am, 11am, and 10.30pm news bulletins, though it will continue to produce the 5pm news bulletin. 'It is a tough period for Ten and we need to take some painful, but necessary, measures to restructure the business,' the email to staff said. 'Unfortunately, it is proposed that Wake Up and the Early, Morning and Late News will cease production on Friday, May 23, 2014. Studio 10 is performing well and will continue as a vital part of our daytime schedule, which ranks number one.' He concluded the email saying: 'The next few weeks will be a difficult and sad period, as colleagues leave the business.' The last episode of Wake Up will air on Friday. Channel 10 CEO Hamish McLennan informed staff yesterday that the breakfast show Wake Up and some news bulletins will be axed. It is rumoured that up to 150 jobs will be cut . The Wake Up replacement line-up includes Ready, Steady, Cook at 6am, followed by repeats of Bold and The Beautiful, pictured, and then first-run episodes of Jamie's 30 Minute Meals .","Presenter Natarsha Belling was seen looking anxious and upset as she walked on a footpath in Sydney's eastern suburbs on Thursday .

"By . John Stevens . Senior Conservatives have drawn up plans to cap immigration from poorer countries as part of the renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with the EU. Limits would be placed on the number of people coming from countries where wages and benefits are lower than in the UK. The restrictions would include existing EU members, such as Romania and Bulgaria, as well as countries joining in the future. The cap, tearing up the EU’s founding principle of free movement, is thought to have won some backing in the Cabinet. The Prime Minister has promised to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before an in-out referendum by the end of 2017 . Senior Tories want immigration reform to be at the centre of efforts to renegotiate the relationship with Brussels. Under the proposals, there would be ‘two rings of Europe’, with Britain and others breaking away from eurozone countries committed to closer integration. Countries in the ‘outer ring’ would focus on trade, with business regulations, human rights laws and entitlements to benefits all radically cut. The Prime Minister has promised to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU before an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. David Cameron is facing calls from his MPs to spell out what measures he hopes to achieve in a renegotiation. Some in the Tory party want him to adopt a tougher stance on immigration to see off the threat of Ukip at next year’s general election. Mr Cameron has previously talked about proposals for a wealth test to stop migration from countries joining the EU, such as Turkey and Albania, until their economies are closer aligned to the UK. But some Conservative MPs want the idea extended to include countries that are already members. People from these countries would still be allowed to come to Britain, but their numbers would be limited. People from these countries would still be allowed to come to Britain, but their numbers would be limited. Earlier this year there were reports of a Cabinet split on whether a pledge to stop the influx of foreign workers from poorer European nations should be included in the Tories’ 2015 manifesto. Home Secretary Theresa May is said to be one of those pressing to limit the number of migrants from existing member states. Critics have cast doubt on Mr Cameron’s ability to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU after he failed in his attempt to stop the appointment of arch-federalist Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European Commission. Labour said it had been an ‘utter humiliation’ to be outvoted by 26 to 2 on Mr Juncker’s candidacy. After the defeat, Mr Cameron came closer to suggesting he would recommend a No vote in a referendum on EU membership if he fails to claw back powers from Brussels before 2017. ‘I will always do what’s in the national interest,’ he told the Commons. He conceded that renegotiating a looser, more trade-based relationship with Brussels would be harder with Mr Juncker at the helm, but insisted it was still achievable. It has been argued that some countries owe Mr Cameron a debt after overriding his opposition to the appointment of Mr Juncker.","Restrictions would include existing EU members Romania and Bulgaria .

"By . John Stevens . Fireman will stage eight days of rush hour strikes as part of its long-running dispute over pensions. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) today announced that members would walk out during peak hours as part of a string of stoppages later this month. Fire Minister Brandon Lewis condemned the move, saying that firemen were already being offered 'one of the most generous pension schemes in the whole public sector'. Members of the Fire Brigades Union will stage eight days of rush hour strikes as part of its long-running dispute over pensions . Mr Lewis said: ‘The Fire Brigades Union keeps disrupting a taxpayer funded service with more unnecessary industrial action. ‘The proposals put forward protect the earned rights of a higher proportion of members than any other public sector scheme. Nearly three quarters will see no change in their pension age in 2015. ‘Under the new scheme, a firefighter who earns £29,000 will still be able to retire after a full career aged 60, get a £19,000 a year pension, rising to £26,000 with the state pension. ‘The equivalent private pension pot would be worth over half a million pounds and require firefighters to contribute twice as much.’ All firefighters in the union across England and Wales will refuse to work between 6am and 8am and 5pm and 7pm from Monday 14 July until Thursday 17 July. They will then walk out in seven further two-hour strikes from Friday 18 July until Monday 21 July. The FBU claimed that current proposals on pensions and later retirement age were ‘unacceptable, unworkable and unrealistic’. All firemen in the union across England and Wales will refuse to work between 6am and 8am and 5pm and 7pm from Monday 14 July until Thursday 17 July . It has been in negotiations with the Government for three years in an attempt to avoid the implementation of proposals that they say would see firemen paying more, working longer and receiving less. Matt Wrack, FBU general secretary, said: ‘The Government must realise that firefighters cannot accept proposals that would have such devastating consequences for their futures, their families' futures - and the future of the fire and rescue service itself. ‘We have tried every route available to us to make the Government see sense over their attacks. ‘Three years of negotiations have come to nothing because the Government is simply unwilling to compromise or even listen to reason despite a huge amount of evidence showing their planned scheme is unworkable. ‘Shorter strike periods have illustrated the strength of feeling amongst firefighters whilst limiting disruption to the fire service, the public and our members' working lives. ‘But the Government is merely ploughing ahead, forcing firefighters to react.’ Matt Wrack, FBU general secretary, said the union had tried to 'make the Government see sense over their attacks' FBU members in Wales and England will join the huge strike by over a million public sector workers next Thursday. The firemen have taken strike action over the past year but the dispute remains deadlocked. In December a retired father-of-two Richard Nicholson died in a blaze in a flat in north London during a walkout by fire crews. A neighbour raised the alarm at 9.52pm but striking firemen remained on their picket line until the four-hour walkout ended at 10pm. When they arrived at his ground-floor flat they found his body.","Fire Brigades Union announces plan to strike action from Monday 14 July .

"By . John Stevens . Sir David Higgins, chairman of the taxpayer-funded high-speed rail scheme, said it would be wrong to ‘skimp’ on employing workers for the £50billion project . Opponents of the costly HS2 rail project have reacted with fury after its boss said he needed to hire at least 20 to 30 people on more than the Prime Minister’s £142,500 salary in the next six months. Sir David Higgins, chairman of the taxpayer-funded high-speed rail scheme, said it would be wrong to ‘skimp’ on employing workers for the £50billion project. But MPs today said the project had turned into a ‘glorious gravy train’ and accused bosses of showing ‘complete disregard’ for those having to stump up the money. Sir David, who himself is paid £597,000, said it was ‘absolutely essential’ to pay more to get the right people for the jobs. ‘The worst money you can save is skimping on hiring the best people,’ he told BBC Newsnight. ‘I am determined that we hire the best people. We are not going to pay over the odds, we probably won't even pay what the private sector would pay.’ He added: ‘We have to have the flexibility to hire the right people now rather than when something gets into a problem in years to come.' Sir David said the staff would be held accountable for their performance and ‘if they don't perform they'll go’. ‘They won't be on long-term government pensions or long-term tenure,’ he said. ‘At a senior level, you are talking about people above the Prime Minister's salary, in the next six months we need to hire 20 or 30 of those at least to do a project of this size.’ Earlier this year, HS2 hired new chief executive Simon Kirby on a salary of £750,000. Peter Bone, Conservative MP for Wellingborough, said that the spending was ‘out of control’. He said: ‘I find these salaries hard to justify, but it is hard to justify the cost of the whole project. ‘It just goes to show the enormous amount of money that will have to be spent to get dubious returns. It confirms what many of us feared. ‘I do not agree that these salaries would be paid in the private sector. I think people think, 'oh it’s public money, so we’ll spend it'.’ Barry Sheerman, Labour MP for Huddersfield, said: ‘This just confirms my worry that HS2 will be another massive folly that we pour endless money into. ‘Taxpayers will have to fund these massive salaries and have every right to get mad. It is ridiculous and shows a complete disregard for those paying for this. The project is turning into one glorious gravy train and I don’t like it. ‘At a time when money is desperately needed for other transportation links this seems wrong. There just is not a desperate need for a faster link to London.’ John O’Connell, director of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘HS2 is a ridiculous vanity project that’s already going to cost every man, woman and child a cool £1,000. ‘Inflated salaries are only going to push the cost up even further and those in charge of HS2 have a moral duty to spend taxpayers’ money appropriately. It’s time to scrap this extortionate train-set before it derails the public finances.’ The first phase of HS2 between London and Birmingham is due to be complete in 2026, before the second phase of a Y-shaped section linking the line to Manchester and Leeds is due to be finished in 2032-33. The total cost of the project is estimated at £42.6bn, of which £14.56bn is contingency, with a further £7.5bn needed for the high-speed trains. However, Sir David refused to give a guarantee that the project would not run over budget. He said: ‘I can never guarantee anything personally. ‘What I can do it put in place the decision-making process and the right people to make sure we make the right decisions and we can properly and adequately manage the budget.’ The coalition government has repeatedly said public servants should not be paid more than the Prime Minister. But Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin  said the salaries estimated by Sir David ‘fell within the budget we've set’, but would need to get Treasury clearance. Mr McLoughlin told BBC Radio Derby: ‘It has to go through a procedure, I have to get clearance from the Treasury and that will be done. I'm OK with that.’ He added: 'These people are not civil servants, they are engineers at the height of their skills who would be paid a lot more in the private sector. I hope we find the best people for this project. It's a very important project.’ A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said: ‘This is a vital infrastructure project and of course it is important that we have the right people running and working on that project in order to deliver it on time and on budget and at good value for the taxpayer.’ Earlier this week a committee of six MPs began the process of scrutinising the nearly 2,000 objections to the HS2 bill. The fate of the scheme will be decided in a vote of all MPs.","Sir David Higgins says it would be wrong to 'skimp' on £50billion project .

"By . John Stevens . Elderly patients could be given unhealthy treats to encourage them to eat, a leading doctor said . Junk food should be served to older patients on wards to prevent malnutrition, the health boss in charge of hospital food has said. Elderly people could be given unhealthy treats such as doughnuts, ice cream and chips in order to encourage them to eat as part of an overhaul of hospital food. Dr Liz Jones, head of environment at the Department of Health, who is responsible for policy on hospital food, said it was more important patients ate food they liked rather than leave healthy food uneaten. Ministers are also concerned at the high cost of the 30million uneaten meals that are thrown away annually. It is feared many uneaten dishes are recipes that elderly patients would not normally eat, such as Thai curry. Speaking at Age UK’s For Later Life . conference, the doctor warned that older people at risk of not eating enough had . become ‘terrified’ because of anti-obesity campaigns. Dr Jones said: ‘We know that patients need better nutritional care because if they do not eat enough they will get sicker quicker and better slower. ‘If we give them nice food it will make them feel better. 'When you’re poorly you almost always . lose your appetite. You might not lose it completely, but you will go . off certain things at least. There are virtually no serious illnesses . that lead to an increase in appetite. ‘We know that one hundred junk calories inside is a lot better than 500 healthy calories that you just look at.' Dr Jones, who is currently conducting a major review of hospital food, said promoting healthy eating was important but making sure patients ate is what ‘worries me’. She said: ‘We could say we should concentrate on making sure that people eat. It doesn’t matter what it is, just as long as they eat, even that food is unhealthy, we should concentrate on helping them to eat, because if we don’t they’ll get sicker. ‘But there’s also this thought that we have to consider, maybe we should concentrate on healthy food because people are affected by obesity and the NHS should set a good example. ‘They’re both important, but really it’s the first that worries me. It’s about getting patients to eat and particularly elderly patients.’ Dr Liz Jones said calories from items such as doughnuts, crisps and ice-cream were better for patients for nothing at all . She added that there was a risk that the elderly were put off eating because of healthy eating campaigns. She said: ‘I think there is an awful talked about obesity to the extent that people have become terrified of any kind of putting on weight, they see it as a bad thing.’ Dr Jones is drawing up national standards, which will be issued in September as part of the hospital food review by the government and Age UK. It follows concerns that a third of vulnerable patients are not being given enough help at meal times, risking malnutrition and dehydration. Many are too frail even to open cling-film or cardboard packaging and are left struggling as nursing staff move on to the next bed. Ministers are also concerned at the high cost of waste as 30 million uneaten meals are thrown away annually. It is feared many dishes consist of recipes that elderly patients would not normally eat, like Thai curry. Dianne Jeffrey, chairman of Age UK, who is chairing the review panel, told the conference: ‘Malnutrition is a word we often associate with developing countries, but actually there are a million older people living in our community who are already malnourished or at risk at becoming so. ‘When older people are malnourished they are much greater risk of poor health, more likely to go into hospital, and need more time to recover. ‘In many cases, malnutrition is preventable with the right help and support. This is a hugely serious and often hidden problem. ‘Older people and professionals tend to assume that losing weight and loss of appetite is a normal part of ageing, but that is not the case.’","Dr Liz Jones said treats such as doughnuts should be given to patients .
She said 100 calories of junk food was better than not eating at all ."
"By . John Stevens . The former . Commons Deputy Speaker who was cleared of rape and sexual assault faces a . plot by his local party to deselect him after he revealed he would like . a gay marriage. After his trial earlier this year, Nigel Evans was welcomed back to Parliament by fellow MPs. However, . his local party has been engulfed in a row over whether he is fit to . remain as candidate, while the chairman of the Tory association has . quit. Michael . Ranson, 72, has supported Mr Evans since he came out as gay three years . ago, and was also his election agent. But it is claimed the chairman’s . ‘final straw’ came when the MP told an interviewer he would like to one . day marry a man. Former Commons deputy speaker Nigel Evans was cleared of a string of sex assaults, but is facing a grassroots campaign to deselect him as a Tory candidate for the next election . Opponents . are also unhappy about disclosures during the court case, including Mr . Evans’s admission that he slept with a 22-year-old man who was on work . experience. The . executive committee of the  Ribble Valley association in Lancashire . will now vote on whether Mr Evans, who has a majority of more than . 14,000, should be re-adopted as their candidate in the coming weeks. If . they decide not to, Mr Evans can demand a ballot of all local Tory . members. Mr . Evans, who claims he has the support of senior Tories including the . Prime Minister, last night said that he was ‘confident’ that he would . win the ballot, but admitted that he had heard local whisperings. He said: ‘I’m convinced that I will get through the process with flying colours. The vast majority of people are supporting me. ‘Clearly . you do get to hear some comments via other people that there are some . sort of mutterings and concerns but the reality is I was acquitted by a . court of all charges. ‘There’s . only going to be a small element of homophobia but it’s incredibly rare . to hear any of it. The vast majority were delighted when I came out in . 2010, that I’m able to get on with my life, and wish me well for the . future.’ Mr . Ranson, who is mayor of Ribble Valley, is said to have fallen out with . Mr Evans following his acquittal after he told his local newspaper, ‘I . would love to have a serious, committed and special relationship with . another man. I would like to have a gay marriage.’ Mr Evans, pictured here on the Commons terrace, has been criticised in his Ribble Valley constituency over his lifestyle in Parliament . A supporter of Mr Evans said: ‘That, according to Mr Ranson, was the final straw.’ Last . night Mr Ranson declined to comment on the reselection row and declined . to discuss the reasons for his resignation from the association last . week. He said: ‘I would prefer not to comment at the moment, as this is an association matter.’ Asked . specifically about the claim he became unhappy with Mr Evans’s comments . about gay marriage, he said: ‘I do not comment on such nonsense.’ Other senior figures in the constituency spoke privately of a mood of increasing conflict within the association. One . said: ‘It’s split down the middle ... It’s nothing to do with . homophobia – that’s a complete red herring introduced by Nigel. ‘Those against him simply feel that for all that he was innocent at his trial, his behaviour left a lot to be desired. ‘They’re . asking whether it was right for him to surround himself with young men . in and around Westminster. They see his conduct as unbecoming for an . MP.’ Another . said: ‘People in the Ribble Valley are generally pretty . straightforward. They just want a hard-working MP to fight for them. What they’ve found in Nigel is a man who gives the impression of just . going to London to have a ball.’ Meanwhile Conservative voters have written to the local paper calling for Mr Evans to step aside. In April, Mr Evans was cleared by a jury at Preston Crown Court of raping a man and sexually assaulting six others. When . he returned to work, he was toasted with a drinks party in Westminster . and was last week elected to the executive of the 1922 Committee, the . powerful body of backbench Tories.","Mr Evans facing constituency campaign to deselect him ahead of election .

"By . John Stevens . UKIP voters are disconnected because many cannot send and receive emails, use search engines or browse the internet, Labour’s shadow business secretary has suggested. Chuka Umunna said that ‘a lot’ of people who voted for the party in its European elections victory were not computer literate and did not have basic online skills. He promised that a Labour government would be ‘absolutely focused’ on connecting people who have been alienated from the wider economy. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna made the claim to explain why a lot of people supporting UKIP feel disconnected from the modern world. Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Mr Umunna, 35, said: ‘We’ve got to empower our people. ‘The BBC has carried out some very interesting research on this. One in five people in our economy cannot do the four basics online of sending and receiving an email, browsing the internet, filling in an online form. ‘Now there’s been a lot of talk about communities who’ve been disconnected from our global economy and those of course were a lot of those who were voting for UKIP in the local and European elections. ’And of that mass of people who can’t do the things that all of us take for granted, a very large number of them are from those communities. ‘So the next Labour Government, we are going to be absolutely focused on connecting people into the global economy, so they can realise their dreams and aspirations.’ Last month, the UK Independence Party became the first party other than the Conservatives or Labour to win a national election since 1906 when it surged to victory in the European elections. The party led by Nigel Farage also picked up more than 100 council seats from Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems. UKIP leader Nigel Farage has enjoyed success in local and European elections, which his party puts down in part to a strong presence on social media . After the election, Suzanne Evans, who lost her seat as a councillor in Merton, said the party had not replicated its national success in London as voters more ‘media-savvy’. She said: ‘I don’t think we have got our message across in London. We do have a more media-savvy, well educated population in London and they are more likely to have read some of the negative press that’s been about us.’ Ed Miliband last year announced that former Tomorrow's World presenter Maggie Philbin would lead a Labour-backed taskforce on developing young people's digital skills. In a speech, the Labour leader warned that the UK is falling behind on IT and said the government is ‘letting down’ businesses and the workforce. A BBC study published earlier this year found that 19 per cent of adults did not have the basic skills of being able to send and receive emails, use a search engine, browse the internet, and fill out an online application form. Mr Umunna, who has been compared to Barack Obama, is a rising star in the Labour party and has been tipped as a possible future leader. Last year, the Streatham MP and former DJ caused anger after it was revealed that he had once criticised nightclubs in London for not being trendy enough. While working in his old job as a lawyer eight years ago, Mr Umunna had written online: ‘Is it just me or is there a serious lack of cool places to go in central London at the weekends? ‘Most of the West End haunts seem to be full of trash and C-list wannabes, while other places that should know better opt for the cheesy vibe.’","Claims UKIP supporters cannot send email or use search engines .

"By . John Stevens . When the Chinese premier visited London this week he was greeted with an honour guard, a Downing Street reception and a meeting with the Queen. But one aspect of Li Keqiang’s welcome fell somewhat short in the eyes of Chinese officials – the red carpet rolled out for his arrival at Heathrow. After plans for Mr Li’s visit were shown to the Beijing government, aides complained that the carpet leading from the steps of his plane was not long enough. Scroll down for video . Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, being given a guard of honour at the Treasury building in London. On his arrival at Heathrow he is said to have complained the red carpet was too short . ‘They saw a diagram of the arrangements at Heathrow and complained that the carpet was three metres too short,’ said one of the visit organisers. The objection was raised with Ed Llewellyn, the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, but he is said to have told the Chinese official he had other things to worry about. ‘He said that he was sure the carpet would meet their requirements,’ the visit organiser told the Financial Times. Mr Li is said to have demanded to meet the Queen, who welcomed him to Windsor Castle, despite the fact that it is relatively unusual for her to receive world leaders who are not heads of state. During the visit, she welcomed him to Windsor Castle where they were joined by the Duke of York in the White Drawing Room. Later he went to Downing Street for lunch with the Prime Minister and business leaders where he was served a Chinese-themed menu including claypot chicken in a savoury sauce with shiitake mushrooms. During the visit, the Queen welcomed him to Windsor Castle where they were joined by the Duke of York in the White Drawing Room . One of China’s Communist-controlled newspapers was said to be so angry about the furore about whether Mr Li would be hosted by the Queen that it wrote an editorial in which it called Britain an ‘old, declining empire’ that resorts to ‘eccentric acts’ to cover its waning importance. China’s Foreign Ministry yesterday played down the diplomatic row over the length of the red carpet. A spokesman said: ‘The British side closely co-ordinated with the Chinese side in the reception organisation and visit results, took the initiative in making considerate arrangements and made great efforts to ensure the full success of Premier Li’s visit. The Chinese side expresses its appreciation.’ The demanding requirement was perhaps surprising considering in December 2012 the current Chinese administration banned red carpets, welcome banners, floral arrangements and grand receptions for Chinese officials travelling domestically on official business. Regulations introduced also told officials travelling overseas to restrict the size of their delegations and avoid large receptions at the airport on their arrival.","Aides complained the carpet leading from the steps of his plane wasn't long enough .

"By . John Stevens . A Conservative MP has been forced to apologise after he said he would punch a female journalist in the throat and suggested she should be deported. Michael Fabricant, the former Tory vice chairman, wrote on Twitter that he could never have a debate with commentator Yasmin Alibhai-Brown as he would violently lose his temper. He tweeted: ‘I could never appear on a discussion prog with @y-alibhai I would either end up with a brain haemorrhage or by punching her in the throat.’ Former vice-chair of the Conservative Party Michael Fabricant was sacked after outspoken criticism of the HS2 rail scheme and the Maria Miller expenses row . The comment instantly sparked . widespread anger and he was given a stern warning by party whips who . ordered him to make a full apology. But the flamboyant backbencher . appeared to enjoy the attention, telling  news crews who turned up at . his home after the incident that he ‘felt like a star’. Mrs Alibhai-Brown, who writes for the Daily Mail, said the MP could ‘stuff’ his apology, which was ‘actually making it worse’. She called for him to be kicked out of the Conservative Party if he failed to issue a ‘proper’ statement of remorse. ‘I think they should withdraw the . whip or get him to issue a proper statement,’ she said, adding: ‘I don’t . know if you have seen these tweets but if a child did this we would . never accept these apologies. He’s not a child. Why is he doing this?’ Mrs Alibhai-Brown, a Muslim who came . to Britain from Uganda in 1972, added that she felt like Mr Fabricant . was ‘encouraging’ people who have previously threatened violence against . her. She said: . ‘These guys find us unbearable. I . think they still think Asian women should be their ayahs, their . nursemaids, or selling takeaways.’ Mr Fabricant wrote the controversial . message after watching Mrs Alibhai-Brown clash with journalist Rod . Liddle on Channel 4 News. During a discussion about Islam and . how immigration has changed Britain, Mrs Alibhai-Brown told Mr Liddle: . ‘I have no words to express how much I loathe you and I feel quite proud . that I am able to tell you that.’ Outspoken journalist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown claimed Tory MPs like Mr Farbicant wanted Asians like her to 'serve curry' After Mr Fabricant published his . message, he went on to re-tweet a post written by another user which . read: ‘She disgusts me. Should be deported.’ Mr Fabricant then attempted . to make amends, explaining in a series of tweets that Mrs Alibhai-Brown . was ‘utterly infuriating’ but he would not have actually punched her. He wrote: ‘So just for the avoidance . of any doubt, I am very sorry for the tweet. It was wrong to joke about . punching and I completely withdraw it and apologise.’ David Cameron yesterday condemned the tweets as ‘completely unacceptable’ but ruled out withdrawing the whip from the MP. MP Gloria De Piero, Labour’s women . and equalities spokesman, said the comments were ‘utterly appalling’ and . it was ‘unacceptable that views like this persist in the Conservative . Party’. But Andrew Allison, from the Freedom . Association, said: ‘Everyone knows, or at least should know, that it was . a figure of speech. Michael Fabricant finds her frustrating and doesn’t . particularly like her views. He’s not advocating thumping her.’ Mr Fabricant, who is a former whip, . was sacked as a party vice chairman in April after he tweeted ‘about . time’ when Maria Miller stepped down as Culture Secretary following her . expenses row. She seemed to enjoy getting her own . back yesterday, tweeting a picture with the text: ‘Think B4 U Type.’ Mr . Fabricant has built up a loyal following on Twitter, where he has become . known for courting controversy. When it emerged that Flight MH370 had . gone missing, he tweeted: ‘All our good news on the economy is . currently as submerged and lost as the Malaysian Airlines flight . recorder.’ He also reportedly landed in hot water with the Tory hierarchy after joking about having a relationship with a llama. Since his sacking as party vice . chairman, Mr Fabricant has refused to tone down his Twitter account, . posting: ‘Look, I am still a Conservative MP and my personality and .

"By . John Stevens . William Hague yesterday hinted that Britain could support a female candidate for European Commission president. The Foreign Secretary said he believed it was important ‘there are women in the top jobs’ of Europe as he continued to voice his opposition to leading candidate Jean-Claude Juncker. ‘It’s very important in our view that a range of candidates are looked at,’ he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. View: William Hague (left) said he believed it was important 'there are women in the top jobs' of Europe as he continued to voice his opposition to leading candidate Jean-Claude Juncker (right) ‘This is only one of the top jobs being decided in the European Union, there are four or five such jobs and it’s very important there is a political balance, a geographical balance, it’s important there are women in the top jobs.’ He refused to name his preferred candidates for the presidency. ‘There are talented candidates around Europe and what I’m not going to do is set up a candidate, to embarrass a candidate today who will then be attacked by the media or other countries,’ he said. ‘So we will keep our counsel and keep in close touch with other countries, the Prime Minister will have further discussions about this over the next few days with other heads of government, the important thing for us is the trajectory of the EU and our ability to deliver reform, renegotiation, powers to come back from Brussels.’ Potential: Dalia Grybauskaite, the President of Lithuania, has emerged as possible consensus candidates for the presidency following Britain¿s staunch opposition to Mr Juncker .

"By . John Stevens . Labour MPs have been told to hold coffee mornings to talk to their constituents about immigration in a desperate bid to fight the threat of UKIP. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, has written to all MPs and candidates with a script on how to talk to voters about their concerns. In a leaked document, she admits the party ‘got things wrong in the past’, but encourages MPs to challenge people on their fears about immigration. Ed Miliband's MPs have been told to use chatting over coffee to tackle public fears about immigration . MPs and candidates have been invited to attend ‘drop-in’ sessions with Miss Cooper this afternoon as the party attempts to present a united front on the key issue. The bid to counter the rise of UKIP comes after Labour suffered disappointing results in the local and European elections last month. There are concerns that working class voters in its traditional heartlands are deserting the party in favour of UKIP. The ‘immigration campaign pack’ tells MPs and candidates: ‘It is important people know that Labour are listening to their concerns on immigration’. It adds: ‘Labour got things wrong in the past, particularly in not introducing transitional controls for eastern Europe. And we’ve changed on immigration.’ The documents contains model invite letters for a ‘listening event’, which it recommends should be ‘an informal event, for example a coffee morning’. MPs have been issued with a series of responses to people’s worries about immigration when campaigning on the doorstep. Among the advice, they are told ‘there is no evidence of an overall impact on wages’ from immigration. The issue of benefits tourism is brushed aside with the statistic that ‘only 2.6 per cent of EU migrants claim unemployment benefits’, even though this still amounts to thousands of people. The plan has been drawn up by shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper who admits Labour 'got things wrong in the past' on immigration . MPs are also told to rebut claims that there are problems with immigrants taking social housing. Conservative MPs last night said that Labour needed to do more than hold coffee mornings to be trusted on immigration. Priti Patel, Tory MP for Witham, said: ‘Labour’s legacy on immigration was an open door policy and invitation for all to come to Britain. Coffee mornings will do little to restore public confidence in Labour’s approach to immigration. Labour MPs fear the impact of the rise of UKIP, led by Nigel Farage, ahead of the next election . ‘The truth is they have opposed the measures proposed by the Conservatives to reform the broken and dysfunctional system they left. If they got back into power they would open the borders again and do away with the policies we have introduced to keep our borders safe and secure.’ Charlie Elphicke, Tory MP for Dover, said: ‘Labour are hopelessly out of touch. We don’t need coffee mornings, we need action. ‘Under Labour, pretty much everyone was allowed to wander into the country. ‘But under this Government, we’ve seen action to make our borders safe and secure and a crackdown on benefit tourism. We need to see more action like that.’ Earlier this month, seven rebel Labour MPs, including Frank Field, Kate Hoey and John Mann, published an open letter to Ed Miliband arguing that the unrestricted entry of EU citizens from eastern Europe since 2004 was hurting the ‘very communities that the Labour Party was founded to represent’. The MPs said that concern with immigration had become an important priority for a large proportion of working-class and middle-class voters. They added: ‘While the benefits of mass migration have been served in abundance to many wealthy people, who are in a position to take advantage of cheap labour, we believe that the lack of affordable housing, school places, hospital capacity and transport infrastructure to accommodate this influx of people means that poorer people’s living standards have been squeezed.’ A spokesman for Miss Cooper last night said: ‘We believe we should be talking about immigration a lot more and one way to do that is at coffee mornings. ‘We shouldn’t ape UKIP, we should take them on. This document outlines our progressive approach to immigration - it has benefits, but those benefits need to be shared by everyone.’","Yvette Cooper  has written to all MPs and candidates with a script on how to talk to voters about their concerns .

"By . John Stevens . The richest must pay more tax, Nick Clegg said yesterday as he set out plans to raise money after the general election next year. The Liberal Democrat leader revealed his party’s manifesto would target the wealthy with measures including a reformed ‘mansion tax’. In a speech seen as the start of a fight back after the Lib Dems’ disastrous European and local election results, Mr Clegg also indicated he is prepared to borrow to build homes and boost the economy through infrastructure projects. Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg speaks at Bloomberg, central London where he announced the revival of his party's 'mansion tax' as a means to get more money out of the wealthy . Mr Clegg said the party was committed to reducing the deficit, but said he believed it should be done ‘in a fundamentally different way to the Conservatives’. He said: ‘The Tories have now ruled out asking the very wealthy to pay even just a bit more in tax to help the ongoing fiscal effort. Instead, they’ve said they’ll take billions more from the welfare budget.’ He added: ‘We’ll finish the job (of eliminating the deficit), of course we will – but we’ll finish it in a way that is fair. ‘So not just through further spending cuts, but also by asking those with the broadest shoulders to make some additional contributions too, including for instance through our banded Mansion Tax - extending new tax bands to higher value properties.’ The Lib Dems want the levy, which would be paid in addition to council tax, to be introduced for properties worth more than £2million. Nick Clegg said he was committed to ‘significantly’ reducing the national debt as a percentage of GDP every year from 2018/19 but said he would borrow to invest in projects to boost growth. He said: ‘We are prepared to put our shoulders to the wheel and use the muscle of the state - if necessary through borrowing - to rewire and revamp our infrastructure.’ Mr Clegg's wife Miriam Gonzalez, Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, and  British Business Secretary Vince Cable listen as the Lib Dem leader speaks at Bloomberg's central London headquarters yesterday . Up to 300,000 new homes a year are needed to meet demand, he said, adding: ‘It’s time to put our money where our mouth is. 'We have to give people the homes they need and protect the country from another crisis - and if that means borrowing a bit when times are good and debt is falling, so be it.’ He added: ‘We are not the Tories. We don’t believe in an ever-shrinking state. We are not so ideological about making cuts that we’ll deny people the things they need. ‘We’re not so dogmatic about borrowing that we’ll jeopardise Britain’s economic health. Responsibility, yes, austerity forever, no.’ Mr Clegg admitted that a series of ‘gory’ spending decisions have left young voters who ‘dream of a better future’ questioning whether the Liberal Democrats are there for them. The ‘notorious’ decision to ditch their pledge on tuition fees and the ‘pretty gritty’ and ‘downright unappealing decisions’ the party has taken in government means they have a lot of work to do to win back younger voters, he conceded. He shrugged off questions over the future of his position as party leader insisting it would not be ‘sensible’ to put someone new at the helm. He said: ‘If I thought a year before the general election all the issues that face us could be solved magically and could float off like the morning mist by just changing personnel at the top and spending several months talking to ourselves of course I’d think. But I just think - obviously I don’t think - that is sensible for the party.’","Speech seen as fightback after Lib Dems' disastrous election results .

"By . John Stevens . and Jack Doyle . Back at home, his colleagues were campaigning furiously  in the final hours before their party’s crucial by-election. Ukip leader Nigel Farage, meanwhile, seemed more interested in a different kind of party as he enjoyed a boozy night in the Mediterranean. But the 50-year-old was less than happy when pictures emerged of him returning to his hotel hand in hand with a blonde woman just before 4am. Yesterday, as he returned from the trip, Mr Farage angrily dismissed allegations of inappropriate behaviour as ‘fluff and nonsense’, saying: ‘I didn’t go to bed with her.’ Dinner guests: Nigel Farage says he  is the victim of 'abhorrent mischief making' after he was photographed with Ande Soteri at 3.42am after a gala dinner in Malta . Helping hand: The MEP says his companion is disabled and says he was supporting her as she walked into the Hilton in Valletta . Married Mr Farage had jetted off to Malta to speak at a travel conference, despite it being the last days of campaigning in the crucial Newark by-election where Ukip had hoped to win its first seat in Westminster. While party activists were busy campaigning in the Nottinghamshire constituency, Mr Farage was more than 1,500 miles away at a gala dinner the night before his speech. After the meal, Mr Farage and  the travel industry delegates went  out drinking, before ending the night  in a penthouse bar in the island’s  tallest building. Fiona Jeffery, a former travel boss, took to Twitter to share a picture of the Ukip leader looking worse for wear and surrounded by a group of blonde women, adding the caption: ‘Nigel Farage gets up close to travel industry.’ Mr Farage was then photographed returning to his five-star hotel at  3:42am, holding hands with tourism boss Ande Soteri. Last night Mr Farage insisted  that he had just been helping  the 49-year-old, who was walking with the aid of a crutch, to  make her way back to the hotel from the bar. 'Mischief-making': Nigel Farage, pictured today, . has called claims he had a late night liaison in Malta 'disgusting' after he was seen entering a hotel with Ande Soteri, right, holding . hands . Upset: Mr Farage looked tired and under strain as he removed a black suitcase from the boot of his car after saying any suggestion that he did anything improper is 'so ridiculous' He said: ‘The next time I see  a disabled . person I am just  ignoring them. She is a seriously disabled woman on a . crutch  and I actually helped her by  carrying her bag. ‘The allegations are just  fluff and nonsense. She is a  disabled woman who I helped back to the hotel.’ Asked if he had met her before, he said: ‘I haven’t even got her phone number.’ A . Ukip press officer added:  ‘This is utterly, utterly ludicrous. This . woman walks with a  stick and he was helping her to the front door of a . hotel. It is disgusting mischief-making [to suggest otherwise].’ As Mr Farage gave his speech at the conference on Wednesday, just hours after his pre-dawn partying came to an end, he joked to delegates that he had been up for most of the night drinking. He also appeared in a spoof party election broadcast shown at the conference for the ‘No-kip’ party, in which he said: ‘I’ve always thought sleep to be a  terrible, shocking, awful waste  of time. Evenings? What are they for? They’re for the excessive consumption of alcohol.' Night out: Mr Farage had been at a gala dinner in Malta and says he was simply supporting the disabled woman home . Claims: Former Ukip MEP Nikki Sinclaire, left, accused Mr . Farage in the European Parliament of paying both his wife and 'former . mistress' Annabelle Fuller using taxpayers' money. Mr Farage denies . having an affair . Miss Soteri, who is commercial . director for the conference organiser, yesterday denied that anything . improper had happened with Mr Farage. She said: ‘Yes, I was with Mr Farage. We are staying at the same hotel – there was no impropriety between us.’ MEP Godfrey Bloom, Mr Farage's Brussels flatmate, has claimed the Ukip leader's weakness is women . Mr Farage flew back to the UK and . returned for half an hour to his home in Kent, which he shares with his . German second wife Kirsten, before going on to Newark, where voters were . heading to the polls yesterday. Mrs Farage, 47, who married him in 1999 and now works as his secretary, refused to comment on the photographs. The political leader, who has four children from his two marriages, has been accused in the past of having extra-marital relations. In 2005, reports emerged of him having a seven-times-a-night tryst with a Latvian woman. He denied the claims but was allegedly  presented with a can of 7UP by Ukip members. In March, former Ukip MEP Nikki Sinclaire challenged the Ukip leader in the European Parliament over accusations that he employs both his wife and alleged ‘former mistress’ Annabelle Fuller on his taxpayer-funded payroll. Both Mr Farage and Miss Fuller, a Ukip press aide, deny they had an affair, with Mr Farage dismissing the claims as ‘absolute nonsense’. There had been speculation that Mr Farage would stand as Ukip’s candidate in the Newark by-election, but since he ruled that out he has appeared to have distanced himself from the contest. However, while enjoying himself in Malta, he continued to post messages on Twitter encouraging party supporters to keep campaigning in the seat.

"By . John Stevens . Nigel Farage has said that some tax avoidance schemes are ‘OK’ as he declared nobody pays more tax than they have to. The UKIP leader defended using the schemes to reduce tax bills after it emerged he is using a private company that could halve the tax paid on his media earnings. Mr Farage has funneled up to £4,000 a month in income from sidelines such as TV appearances and on the lecture circuit into the firm called Thorn in the Side Limited. Nigel Farage - sinking a pint after his party's European elections last week - has claimed that some tax avoidance schemes are 'okay', despite widespread public outrage over them . It means that last year he paid only 20 per cent corporation tax on profits of £45,000, instead of 40 per cent income tax. Mr Farage, 50, who set up the company in 2011, said that criticism of the schemes was ‘ridiculous’. He said: ‘No one voluntarily pays any additional income to the Inland Revenue. Most forms of legal tax avoidance are okay, but clearly some are not. ‘To receive money personally I have to pay 40 per cent. Corporation tax at 20 per cent is for retained profits (kept in the company) only, therefore the criticism is ridiculous.’ The use of personal service companies is not illegal, but they have been widely criticised by politicians for being a way to reduce tax bills. Companies House records show that in 2012-13 Thorn In The Side Limited, of which Mr Farage is the only director and owns 100 per cent of shares, made a profit of £45,488. Take That star Gary Barlow faced calls to be stripped of his OBE over revelations he invested in a tax avoidance scheme . If this had been declared as income he would have paid £21,883.03 in 40 per cent income tax and national insurance. But by using the personal service company, he only paid £9,097.60 in corporation tax, and a further £1,687.50 on a £7,500 he took as a dividend, taxed at 22.5 per cent - meaning a saving of £11,097.93 on an income tax bill. Mr Farage will be taxed on the money he has not taken as dividend when it is drawn out later, but by using the company he is able to draw it as income more slowly limiting his tax liability. His firm of accountants, Buckley Watson, based in Leigh, Essex, said it was involved in ‘tax planning’ rather than ‘avoidance’ and has handled accounts for Mr Farage since 2003. Spencer Watson, the firm's founder, said personal service companies to reduce tax were common place. He said: ‘They are used by millions of individuals in the UK to operate their businesses so as to protect their personal assets and to plan their taxes sensibly. ‘It should not be confused with any form of tax avoidance. My firm does not promote or use any tax avoidance scheme and never has done.’ As an MEP, Mr Farage also earns £78,000-a-year from Brussels and employs his wife Kirsten on the taxpayer, on a salary of up to £20,000. In a speech last year, he took aim at ‘a common enemy - rich people, successful companies evading tax which of course is a problem’. He was criticised after admitting he opened an offshore trust fund on the Isle of Man for ‘inheritance purposes’, but later claimed he never used it, adding: ‘It was a mistake. I’m not rich enough.’ In the 2012 London Mayoral race Labour’s Ken Livingstone was criticised for using a personal service company after declaring: ‘No one should be allowed to vote in a British election, let alone sit in Parliament, unless they pay their full share of tax.’ The BBC has also come under fire for . allowing star presenters to have their wages paid into such companies, . which means they end up paying less tax. Last . month there were calls for Gary Barlow to be stripped of his OBE after . it was revealed he faced a £20million tax bill because it was ruled that . a partnership he had invested in was an ‘aggressive’ tax avoidance . scheme, set up for the purpose of making a loss to reduce investors’ tax . bills. Nigel Farage's defence of tax avoidance is in stark contrast to David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg who have all attacked their use . Mr Farage was today in Malta, despite it being the last day of campaigning in the crucial Newark by-election where Ukip hopes to win its first seat in Westminster. Just hours before polling stations opened in the Nottinghamshire constituency, Mr Farage was more than 1,500 miles away speaking at a conference organised by the Institute of Travel and Tourism of the UK. There had been speculation that Mr Farage would stand as Ukip’s candidate in the by-election, but since he ruled that out he has appeared to have distanced himself from the contest. The latest opinion polls suggest the Tories will keep hold of the seat. A newly-elected Ukip MEP yesterday admitted employing dozens of eastern European and Filipino workers in his family care company. But Wales MEP Nathan Gill said that there was no inconsistency with his party’s stance on immigration. Mr Gill, who provided ‘bunkhouse’ accommodation for immigrants working for the company in Hull, said: ‘We employed people from overseas because we could not find local workers to do the jobs. The bunkhouses were temporary accommodation we offered to people coming from overseas until they could get something more permanent.’","UKIP leader says no-one would pay more tax than they had to .

"By . John Stevens . The Conservatives are expected to win the crucial by-election in Newark next week, putting the brakes on the momentum of Ukip, a poll claimed last night. But it predicted the Tory majority in the safe seat will be slashed from 16,000 to around 2,300 after a massive swing to Nigel Farage’s party. The Survation opinion poll last night gave the Conservatives an eight point lead on 36 per cent ahead of Ukip on 28 per cent. David Cameron has already visited the constituency three times and has a fourth visit planned next week . Labour was one point behind with 27 per cent and the Lib Dems in fourth on just five per cent in the poll for the Sun newspaper. Winning in the by-election next Thursday has been described as ‘imperative’ by the Conservatives who are desperate to show that Ukip’s success in last week’s European elections was just a protest vote. David Cameron has already visited the constituency three times and has a fourth visit planned next week. He has ordered all Conservative MPs to make at least three visits each to the constituency, which he has made a priority. After last week's electoral success, Ukip leader Nigel Farage said he planned to do 'everything he could' to seize the seat . Yesterday alone, five ministers were campaigning in Newark, including Chancellor George Osborne, Home Secretary Theresa May and Culture Secretary Sajid David. Tomorrow a further six ministers are expected to make the trip to the seat vacated by shamed Tory MP Patrick Mercer. After last week’s electoral success, Ukip leader Mr Farage said he planned to do ‘everything he could’ to seize the seat. Ukip’s candidate Roger Helmer yesterday said he believed the Conservatives were ‘scared s***less’. He said: ‘We got a great European Election result and that has had a dramatic effect. It has legitimised Ukip as a voters’ choice – if everybody is voting for Ukip it must be all right – and it has shown we can win. 'Cameron is terrified of losing the seat. The Prime Minister coming here three times? I mean, Nigel Farage is coming once. 'Maybe we won’t win, but we will certainly cut that majority right down.’ Tory David Willetts last night dismissed the surge of Ukip and said he was confident the public would vote for the ‘grown-ups’ at the General Election next year. The Universities and Science Minister said voters had had the ‘opportunity to get a message to the government without any real consequences’ but added: ‘Next year people will be picking a government.’","Survation opinion poll gave Conservatives an eight point lead on 36 per cent .

"By . John Stevens . Labour is considering plans to raise National Insurance contributions to fund a massive spending increase in the NHS, it has been claimed. The Shadow Cabinet is looking at  adding 1 per cent to National  Insurance bills for both employees and employers which would be ring-fenced for health spending. The rise would replicate Gordon Brown’s 1 per cent rise, which was  successfully introduced in the 2002 Budget to boost investment in the NHS. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls will consider the implications of the National Insurance tax hike . Labour will hope that a 2015 manifesto commitment to fund a bigger health budget will go down well with voters and create a dividing line with the Tories. But it is likely to be unpopular with business leaders, who are expected to warn that any National Insurance rise could cost tens of thousands of jobs. It is also probable that the Conservatives would accuse Labour of planning a ‘tax bombshell’ that will add to families’ bills at the same time as the party campaigns about the ‘cost-of-living crisis’. Labour is understood to be on the lookout for radical, eye-catching policies – such as increased NHS spending – as it prepares for next year’s election. A ring-fenced rise in National Insurance contributions is thought to be one of the favoured options to pay for the increase. The NI rate varies depending on income and work status, but it is 12 per cent for employees on most of their earnings. A recent poll of marginal seats found that despite the party’s close association with the NHS, only 29 per cent of people agreed that Labour was the ‘most trusted’ party to run the Health Service. Labour MP Frank Field, pictured, who developed the proposal believes voters will accept the tax rise if the funds are used exclusively within the NHS . Labour MP Frank Field has drawn up proposals for the NI plan, and has  presented his ideas to Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls,  health spokesman Andy Burnham and the chairman of Labour’s policy review, Jon Cruddas. Mr Field believes that voters would accept a tax increase if it was spent exclusively on health. He said: ‘Labour desperately needs big ideas to capture the imagination, and this should be one.’ Researchers have warned that there is a looming annual £30billion black hole in NHS spending, with costs reaching more than £130billion a year by 2020. A Labour spokesman last night denied there were set plans for an increase in NI contributions, saying: ‘It is complete nonsense ... there are no plans of this sort.’ Before the 2001 election, Gordon Brown successfully argued for a 1 per cent increase in NI contributions to fund investment in the NHS. However, when he announced plans for another 1 per cent rise, which was not  to exclusively fund the NHS, in the lead-up to the 2010 general election, it was widely criticised. The CBI said higher taxes on employers would cause firms to be more cautious about recruitment, while an Oxford Economics study predicted that it would lead to 91,000 fewer jobs.","Tax hike would be ring-fenced for NHS spending to appease voters .

"By . Jack Doyle . and John Stevens . Home Secretary Theresa May has signalled a tough new line on EU migrants – amid reports of a major Tory split over how to respond to Ukip’s election triumph. Mrs May last night indicated ministers want to radically rein in free movement rules. But aides furiously denied a spat between her and Foreign Secretary William Hague over immigration. Home Secretary Theresa May has taken a tough new line on EU migrants, amid reports of a major Tory split over how to respond to the triumph of Ukip, led by Nigel Farage, pictured right, in the election . The Tories are under pressure after Nigel Farage’s triumph at last week’s European elections. Ministers have already said they would restrict migration from new EU states until their country’s economy was in line with Britain’s. But Mrs May is said to also be pressing to limit migrants from existing member states. This would allow migrants from developed countries such as France, but block those from poorer countries such as Romania and Bulgaria. Mrs May said: ‘We need to reduce the abuse in free movement and we do need to look at free movement.’ Campaigning in Newark, Mrs May added: ‘I recognise the concern people have shown on immigration.’ She went on that she was working ‘across the board to deal with abuse, to make it harder for illegal immigrants to live here, and [to] reduce the pull-factors for people coming here from the European Union'. Former Tory Cabinet minister Norman Lamont has warned that uncontrolled immigration will have 'serious consequences' for society . A report in The Sun yesterday claimed Mr Hague has moved to block tougher controls, saying such a move would be ‘undeliverable’. But a Home Office spokesman said: ‘There is no disagreement between the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary and the Foreign Secretary.’ Meanwhile, former Tory Cabinet minister Norman Lamont warned last night that uncontrolled immigration will have ‘serious consequences’ for society. Lord Lamont criticised claims by former Labour Cabinet ministers Alan Milburn and John Hutton this week, saying they exaggerated the economic benefits of immigration. The Blairite former ministers made the pro-immigration case, writing: ‘Instead of preparing to concede yet more ground on the issue, Mr Miliband should have the courage of his convictions and come out fighting.’ They said the Labour leader must not ‘retreat in the face of the myths and fears of anti-immigrationists’. Lord Lamont, the chancellor under John Major, dismissed their views in a letter to The Times newspaper. He cited a House of Lords report that found ‘no evidence. . . that immigration generates significant economic benefit’. He also rubbished the claim that migrants were a ‘bulwark against an ageing population’. This, he said, would lead to a need for ‘ever escalating levels of immigration’. Lord Lamont added: ‘I am entirely in favour of an open economy such as we have enjoyed for decades, but that does not require massive immigration. ‘To dismiss genuine and justified concerns as “myths and fears” is to play into the hands of extremists. ‘It is not a more stringent immigration policy which would have 'serious consequences for the wellbeing of our economy and society', as they claim. On the contrary, it is failure to respond to the clear and consistent wishes of three-quarters of our population.’","Theresa May indicated she wants to limit migrants from EU member states .

"By . John Stevens . The BBC bill for first and business class flights soared by more than 40 per cent to £1.3million last year, despite its pledges to cut costs. Staff spent more than £3,500 a day on the most expensive fares as they jetted around the world in luxury. The BBC promised a new era of cost-cutting, but has admitted paying £1,278,618 for 950 business and first class tickets in 2013/4 – 46 per cent up on the previous year. Big spenders: The BBC spent almost £1.3million on 950 flights last year and refused to reveal details of 9,000 more . But the figures, revealed under the Freedom of Information Act, include only flights bought using the corporation’s central booking system. The BBC refused to give details of the . 9,000 flights booked in the last two years via external travel agents, . used for major sporting events. Tony Hall vowed to find cost savings of £100million a year when he joined the Corporation last year . Under BBC guidelines, employees are told to use the lowest cost means of transport and use video conferences instead of face-to-face meetings where possible. Travelling any class other than economy is allowed only under ‘exceptional circumstances’ for journeys over four hours and where it saves money on baggage. When director-general Tony Hall was appointed last year, he said the BBC would have to find further cost savings of £100million a year. He has warned ‘tough choices lie ahead’ in the run-up to the renewal of its royal charter at the end of 2016. But last night the BBC was accused of being frivolous with licence fee payers’ cash. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: ‘This only reinforces what the vast majority of people know – the BBC are out of touch.’ Andy Silvester of the Taxpayers’ Alliance said: ‘It’s outrageous that BBC employees, paid for by the licence fee, are racking up huge bills living the high life at our expense.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘Some element of travel is inevitable if the BBC is to cover global news events and deliver programmes from around the world. 'An upgraded flight with additional baggage capacity for bulky camera equipment can often cost less than a standard fare with excess baggage charges.’","Staff spent more than £3,500 a day on most expensive luxury flights .

"By . John Stevens . A disabled man called police after after a UKIP MEP tried to take a megaphone from him after he used it to question him about his expense claims. Roger Helmer, was caught on camera rushing over to try and grab the megaphone after he was heckled during a campaign visit. The 70-year-old, who is standing as an MP in the Newark by-election on June 5, had gone to Retford, Nottinghamshire, on the Ukip battle bus when he was ambushed by Labour protesters. Clash: Mr Helmer (second right) and Mr Challinor (in the orange top) were caught tussling in Retford on camera . His spokesman last night claimed he had just been trying to get hold of the megaphone ‘so he could reply to their questions’. Mr Helmer was speaking to a local journalist in a coffee shop in the market square when he was approached by Labour activists with placards reading: ‘Helmer publish you expenses’. David Challinor, a local councillor and former miner who is registered as disabled following an industrial accident, was shouting ‘please give us your expenses’ through a megaphone when Mr Helmer approached him. In footage, Mr Helmer can be seen quickly going over to him and reaching to try and get hold of the megaphone. Mr Challinor had been urging Mr Helmer to publish his expenses claims during the election campaign trip . Then Mr Helmer and others descended on the group. His spokesman claims he was 'responding' Mr Challinor, who has had five operations on his right arm with which he was holding the megaphone, told the Retford Times: ‘In politics everyone has a right to protest. I am really shocked - I’m protective of my arm as after my accident it was nearly amputated. ‘They kept harping on about whether I was proud of myself but I am proud to stand up for my views.’ Local MP John Mann wrote on Twitter: ‘Roger Helmer’s response to questions about his expenses is to attack protestor in Retford. ‘He broke off press interview to lunge across precinct at expenses protestor in Retford this afternoon. ‘Police have requested and been sent footage of the Helmer incident.’ After the incident, Mr Helmer wrote on Twitter: ‘Sorry to spoil a good rumour, but I’m afraid I have not been arrested by the police.

But they’ve been on the website for years.’ His spokesman, Paul Oakden, added: ‘Roger had gone to talk to the local press and local people. There was a group of people with a megaphone. 'He tolerated it for so long and then went to talk to the group. He tried to get hold of the megaphone so he could reply to their questions. 'He has not had any contact from the police and has not been arrested. The man alleged to be a Labour councillor.

"By . James Slack . and John Stevens . and Andy Dolan . Couple: Paul and Sandra Dunham were due to leave their home in Northampton this morning for London . A British couple facing extradition to . America in a row over expenses are feared to have attempted suicide . just hours before they were due to be handed over to US marshalls. Paul . and Sandra Dunham were last night being treated on separate hospital . wards for a suspected overdose as police stood guard outside. The . couple, both 58, had previously warned they would rather take their own . lives than face the prospect of dying in a US jail. Now their . supporters fear that the moment they are ruled fit to travel, they will . be handed over to American officials by British police. They were due to hand themselves in ahead of a flight to America at a London police station at 10am yesterday. But police were called when they failed to answer the door to early morning visitors to their home in Northampton. Officers . who forced their way in with a battering ram at 7am found Mr and Mrs . Dunham upstairs at their £600,000 four-bedroom detached house. Mr . Dunham was helped to walk from the property to an ambulance. Mrs . Dunham, who was pale but conscious, was taken to another ambulance on a . stretcher. Mr Dunham’s father Fred drove 20 miles to visit the couple . from his home in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. He said his son ‘wasn’t . really  with it’ and declined to comment further. The . case has chilling echoes of the case of Asperger’s sufferer Gary . McKinnon, who doctors warned might take his own life if attempts were . made to bundle him on a plane to the US for computer hacking. Mr McKinnon was saved by Home Secretary Theresa May after a lengthy Daily Mail campaign. Last . night his mother Janis Sharp told the Mail: ‘Will our politicians wait . until someone dies before they change this horrendous extradition treaty . that appears to be being abused by the US?’ Despite . pleas from the Dunhams’ lawyer for a 14-day stay, the Home Office was . last night insisting there was nothing it could do, and any fresh appeal . must be lodged with the courts. The couple have already exhausted the . normal appeal process. Police and ambulance called: A view of the house belonging to Mr and Mrs Dunham in Northampton . The . case has provoked outrage over the use the Extradition Act to haul the . couple across the Atlantic for trial for what their supporters say . amounts to a civil dispute. Mr Dunham is accused of over-claiming . expenses when he was chief executive of US company PACE and his wife of . aiding and abetting her husband. They insist his were ‘wholly . legitimate’ business expenses signed off by a senior director at the . company. Mrs Sharp added: . ‘The Dunhams have been charged with exaggerating their expenses. 'Extradition should only be used for those who have committed heinous . crimes, such as terrorism, not this sort of thing. 'These people are . being dragged from their own country before any evidence has been heard. The fact that this seems to have driven the Dunhams to attempt to take . their own lives shows that extradition can be worse than death.’ Treatment: The couple were taken to Northampton General Hospital (pictured) by ambulance this morning . Isabella . Sankey, director of policy at Liberty, said: ‘The Dunhams’ ordeal is a . terrible indictment of our dangerously unfair extradition laws. Politicians who talked reform but repeatedly failed to deliver – and in . fact made things worse – should think hard about their actions today.’ Mr . Dunham ran the UK arm of the American soldering iron manufacturer, and . his wife worked in sales at the company. After more than 25 years’ service they were asked to move to the US in 2005. William . Siegel, the owner of PACE, promoted Mr Dunham to chief executive after . removing his son Eric from the company. The couple say he agreed the . firm would pay their relocation costs. But . in May 2009, after Mr Siegel brought his son back into the business, . the couple resigned due to disagreements with him and returned to the . UK. Eric Siegel now claims that between 2002 and 2009 the couple . embezzled more than $1million (£600,000) in company expense claims. Defeated: The pair lost a High Court battle last month against extradition to Maryland to stand trial over charges relating to 58-year-old Mr Dunham's company, Pace . In . December 2011 Mr Dunham was indicted on 13 counts of fraud and money . laundering by a grand jury in Greenbelt, Maryland. He could face a . maximum jail sentence of 340 years. His wife was indicted on eight . counts of fraud with a possible sentence of 240 years. Last night a close friend of the Dunhams visited them in hospital and said their condition was ‘greatly improved’. Dorian . Smellie, 42, said he had been told they had been ‘tipped over the edge’ after their MP, Tory Andrea Leadsom, who had been lobbying on their . behalf, told them that the Home Secretary was unable to halt the . extradition. He added: ‘Paul . and Sandra were in their bedroom and were in a bad way. They could not . tell the paramedics what they had taken, but I think it was quite clear . to the ambulance crew what had happened.’","Paul and Sandra Dunham due to be extradited to Greenbelt in Maryland, US .

"By . James Chapman . and Jason Groves . and John Stevens . An Opinium poll for the Daily Mail puts Nigel Farage's Ukip comfortably ahead of Labour, on 32 per cent to 25 per cent . UKIP are on course for an unprecedented victory in today’s European Parliament elections - despite Nigel Farage admitting he is ‘frazzled’  and cannot go on being the party’s dominant face. An Opinium poll for the Daily Mail puts Ukip comfortably ahead of Labour, on 32 per cent to 25 per cent. The Conservatives are on 21 per cent, with the Liberal Democrats battling the Greens for fourth place, each on a miserable 6 per cent. Both Labour and the Conservatives appear reconciled to Ukip coming out on top, despite weeks of controversy over allegations of racism, homophobia and misogyny against the upstart party’s candidates. David Cameron is ordering Tory troops to focus on a Westminster by-election in Newark early next month as an opportunity to halt the Ukip bandwagon. Conservative strategists point to a sharp decline in Mr Farage’s personal ratings in recent weeks and compare him to a ‘shock jock’ radio host whose outbursts will not convince voters at a general election. Labour officials, meanwhile, dismissed suggestions that failure to top the European poll would augur ill for their chances of winning power in 2015. They insisted Ed Miliband will not bow to pressure from some Labour MPs to backtrack on his refusal to match the Conservatives’ promise of an in/out EU referendum, even if his party is beaten by Ukip. Mr Farage said a Ukip victory in the European elections would represent a political ‘earthquake’ and repeated his willingness to do ‘a deal with the devil’ or make local pacts with MPs from other parties if it would help guarantee a referendum on Europe. But he conceded the party would haemorrhage votes at next year’s general election unless it can persuade voters it is more than a ‘one-man band’. The Ukip leader has blamed tiredness for his suggestion last week that everyone knows ‘the difference’ between Romanians and Germans. Mr Farage, whose second wife Kirsten is German, said he would not be happy if Romanians moved in next door. Both Labour and the Conservatives appear reconciled to Ukip coming out on top . ‘Right at the moment I’m so frazzled after a month on the road,’ he told the Mail. ‘This has been relentless. I have been doing this damn hard, maybe too hard actually. ‘This must change; we cannot go into a general election with me being seen to be the dominant figure.’ Mr Cameron said only a Conservative government could deliver a reformed relationship with Brussels, with new controls on free movement and further restrictions on migrants’ benefits. That would followed by an in/out referendum on Britain’s membership by the end of 2017. The Prime Minister said: ‘I’m convinced that we will get the changes that we want and my aim is to secure Britain’s place in a reformed European Union. ‘But that’s the real choice at this election – you’ve got Labour and the Liberals who can’t see anything wrong with Europe and you’ve got Ukip who can’t see anything right with Europe and want to walk away.’ The Liberal Democrats are  preparing themselves to lose all of their MEPs in the European elections today, according to a leaked document advising top party figures on how to react to the defeat. It reveals they have been advised to say they ‘expected’ to lose up to all of their 12 representatives in Strasbourg and to simply say they are ‘disappointed’. The embarrassing memo, leaked to the Guardian newspaper, reveals that in the event of the party winning no seats, or just one or two, in the European elections, they should say: ‘Disappointed with the result but the party remains resolute and this was expected at this point in the electoral cycle.’ If the party clings on to two to three MEPs, senior Lib Dems have been advised to say it is ‘a good result considering the circumstances’. And three and five seats should be billed as ‘a very encouraging result... much better than almost everyone predicted’. In 2009, the Lib Dems won 11 seats and another defected to them a year later. The internal document was presented to the Wheelhouse group, the body chaired by the Lib Dems’ general election co-ordinator Paddy Ashdown.","Opinium poll has Ukip on 32 per cent, with Labour trailing on 25 per cent .

The Chancellor’s pet apparently decided to take a break from life on Downing Street and ambled south of the river.

It was not until two years ago, having moved into Downing Street, that Mr Osborne’s wife Frances got a call telling her Freya had been found, apparently living as a stray. Soon after arriving in Downing Street, Freya was caught landing a paw on David Cameron’s cat Larry in a vicious attack that sent him (the cat, that is) fleeing for cover.

"By . Paul Bentley . and James Tozer . and John Stevens . The mother of the teenage boy suspected of stabbing Ann Maguire to death had gone on holiday shortly before the tragedy, friends and  neighbours said yesterday. She was in Gran Canaria when she heard the shocking news that her son was alleged to have killed his teacher, they said, and was yesterday making her way home to Leeds. Further detail emerged yesterday of the boy's interest in violent video games and heavy metal bands. Scroll down for video . Grim Reaper: The image the teenage suspect in the murder of Corpus . Christi Catholic College teacher Ann Maguire used for his Facebook . profile . The loner, who has a Grim Reaper image on his Facebook page, lived with his mother after she divorced his father, who has since found a new partner with whom he has a young child. Neighbours and friends said his . mother, a 47-year-old human resources manager, 'was away on holiday when . all of this happened' and now faced 'every parent's worst nightmare'. Pupils said the boy had become increasingly withdrawn in recent months. While . he was in the top set in most subjects and was particularly talented . at art, he had few friends at the school. He allegedly said he wanted to . kill himself because of bullying and had boasted of experimenting with . drugs. He also left clues about his desperate state of mind on his . Facebook page. The boy . posted two prominent pictures on his profile – one of the Grim Reaper . and another blurry shot of himself in a T-shirt with the branding of . Achievement Hunter, a YouTube channel that features a group of six men . devoted to violent video games such as Call of Duty, Halo and Grand . Theft Auto. He had a keen interest in 'ultra-violent' video games and weeks before the murder posted a video promoting Dark Souls II, a game in which a 'cursed' character travels through dungeons killing zombies. 'Cornerstone of her school': Spanish teacher Anne Maguire, 61, who was stabbed to death yesterday at the school where she worked, Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds . Caring: Mrs Maguire was described as a 'wonderful' teacher, who had touched the hearts of three generations of pupils . With pupils: Married with two grown-up daughters, Ann Maguire was a caring Spanish teacher known as 'the mother of her school' Dark Souls II, which was released last . month and can be played with others around the world, has a 16+ rating . because of its 'realistic-looking violence'. West Yorkshire Police yesterday said it was 'aware' of his online presence and it is 'forming part of their investigation'. Classmates said the boy had started  to go into school with beer or whisky in recent months. Chloe Ripley, 16, said: 'He was weird and lonely.' The uncle of a friend said Mrs Maguire had generously paid for the boy's food when he was short of money for lunch, but had also disciplined him over using his mobile phone. He said: 'Mrs Maguire used to give him dinner money when his dad left them with nothing.' Thought: A mother and her young daughter pause to look at the flowers and other tributes, including a football shirt, left for Mrs Maguire . Police on scene: The fatal stabbing took place at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds, West Yorkshire . A former pupil at the school, who knew . the boy's 19-year-old brother, said: 'His mum was away on holiday and . his brother was taking care of the house. 'That is why they haven't been able to question him yet because they are waiting for her to fly back.' Friends . of the boy's parents described him as a 'lovely, charming' child and . said they were shocked at the supposed change in his character. His father, a council executive and practising Catholic who recently celebrated his 50th birthday, lives in a smart row  of £350,000 terraces in a village just  outside Leeds with his partner and their young child. The suspect's mother was in Gran Canaria when she heard the shocking news that her son was alleged to have killed his teacher, it was said . The boy visited often but lived with his mother and musician older brother, who plays in a local rock band, in a £115,000 house at the end of a cul-de-sac near  Corpus Christi School. Friends of his mother insisted that she was a good parent. Gudrun Wroot, who worked with her, said she juggled her job with being a single parent. 'It is awful for the family of the woman who has been killed, but it is also traumatic for the family of the boy,' Mrs Wroot said. 'You can't imagine what she must be feeling. It is just terrible. 'But really she is a nice person and a very caring mother. She was extremely concerned that the boys were brought up well and for all I knew they were.' Police had yet to start questioning the boy yesterday. A spokesman declined to comment on whether or not his mother was in the country. A spokesman for Leeds City Council said that for legal reasons it could not comment on whether social services were involved with the family.

"By . John Stevens . Tragic: City workers Elsa Carneau, 25, seemed 'euphoric' moments before she died, a witness said . A City high-flier who died after she was found unconscious in the pool at her health club was acting ‘extremely exuberantly’ and had empty alcohol bottles in her handbag, an inquest heard. Elsa Carneau, 25, a former lingerie model, was discovered face down in the water after she made a series of ‘bizarre’ and ‘strange’ remarks to swimmers including that she swam underwater as she found it peaceful. The French national was pulled from the water and staff at the Virgin Active club in Kensington, West London, attempted first aid, but she was pronounced dead at hospital. The court heard how efforts by emergency services to revive her were hindered by a staff member at the gym who filmed Miss Carneau as she lay unconscious. The jury at Westminster Coroner’s Court was shown CCTV footage of Miss Carneau, who worked as an analyst, getting in the pool in a red swimming costume at around 6pm on Saturday December 3, 2011. She swam 23 lengths of the small pool, before getting out of the pool for 30 seconds, and then returning to swim two more lengths. Rupert Hill, 46, who works in finance in the City and was a member of the gym, told the court that while he was swimming in the pool, he noticed that Miss Carneau was lying underwater and appeared to me holding her breath. After she did not surface for around a minute, he pulled her out of the water and onto the side, and first aiders were called. Mr Hill said that before Miss Carneau had been found underwater he had several conversations with her as they rested between lengths during which she appeared ‘euphoric’. He said: ‘She seemed extremely exuberant in the way she was speaking. She made a couple of comments that were slightly strange. Police found two empty bottle of alcohol in her handbag after she was found face down in the water . Miss Carneau, a French national who worked with GLG Partners, had made 'bizarre comments' to others . ‘She asked “Are you a professional swimmer?” I was swimming with a float, so I said “no, but I try”.’ Mr Hill said that when he told her that his children were half-French, she told him that if they went to the Lycee School in London ‘you get good grades but it will f**k you up’. He added: ‘She said, “I only started learning to swim two months ago, but I can only do breaststroke underwater. I find it very peaceful under there”. I found it strange. ‘She said I’ve got a nose bleed, but she seemed perfectly well. There was no sign of blood. She didn’t seem stressed at all and I thought I must have misheard. Parents Veronique (left) and Pierre Carneau attended the ongoing inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court today . ‘She offered me her goggles. I thought that was a strange thing. “She said at one point I hate the French”. ‘I wonder if swimming up and down lengths had some effect.’ The court heard that in the handbag found in Miss Carneau’s locker there were 10 Marlboro cigarettes and two small empty alcohol bottles. Firefighters from a station that neighbours the gym who went to help before paramedics arrived criticised the gym staff for not carrying out first aid properly and for being a distraction. Ben Young, a London Fire Brigade officer, said that one member of staff was filming them as they attempted to revive Miss Carneau. He said: ‘I was quite shocked at what he was doing. When I told him to give me the phone he said, “you cannot take my phone I’m filming it in case she makes it, so she has something to remember”.’ Brian O’Keefe, the watch manager, added: ‘I was doing compressions when there was a flash of bright light. There was a member of staff filming on his mobile phone. I asked him to stop, it was a distraction. ‘He didn’t, so I asked a member of my team to stop him. He just seemed to be looking in fascination.’ Mr O’Keefe said that the lead first aider at the gym was ‘behaving more emotionally than practically’. He said he believed that CPR was not being done correctly and a defibrillator was not fitted properly. He added: ‘I could see they were trying, but it was not working. ‘There was a doctor present but the doctor seemed overwhelmed also.’ The inquest continues.

Sanya-Jeet Thandi, 21, who was once one of the rising stars of Ukip, has quit today calling the party's latest advertising campaign 'racist' A UKIP poster girl described by Nigel Farage as a ‘rising star’ has quit after describing it as a ‘racist’ and ‘terrifying’ party that she cannot vote for. Sanya-Jeet Thandi, 21, a British-born Indian who had starred in a party election broadcast and spoken at its annual conference, accused Ukip of deliberately attracting racist voters. The university student said the party had abandoned its core supporters and called on others to end their memberships and boycott the upcoming European elections. Just days after she appeared on Channel 4 News to defend the party, Miss Thandi said she had quit as it has ‘descended into a form of racist populism’. She said: ‘The direction in which the party is going is terrifying. This week I decided to leave the party and I will abstain from voting in the upcoming European elections. I urge other Ukip supporters to do the same. ‘Ukip is exploiting the stupidity of ignorant anti-immigrant voters for electoral gain. While the party deliberately attracts the racist vote, I refuse to be associated with them.’ Privately-educated Miss Thandi, who was previously chairman of its youth wing in London, specifically attacked one of its campaign posters for next week’s elections, which reads: ‘26 million people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?’ ‘The poster epitomises where the party is going wrong,’ she wrote in the blog post for the Guardian website. Scroll down for video . Ms Thnadi, who has previously spoken at party conferences, said Ukip was exploiting 'the stupidity of ignorant anti-immigrant voters for electoral gain' ‘This anti-immigrant campaign undermines Ukip's claim not to be a racist party. They are turning the election into a game of ""us"" and ""them"". Well, I am with ""them"". ‘Having worked so hard to help Ukip rid themselves of their ""racist"" label and denying comparisons to the BNP, this direction of campaigning really isn't doing my former colleagues any favours.’ Miss Thandi's accusations come less than a week after Mr Farage appeared alongside of black and ethnic minority candidates at a rally in London, in an attempt to shake off claims Ukip is racist. The London School of Economics anthropology student said that when she joined the party aged 17, ‘there was none of this ""they took our jobs"" business’. She added: ‘Ukip is straying further and further from the policies that attracted so many of its original supporters, instead cynically pursuing ever more aggressive anti-immigrant rhetoric. ‘Ukip's immigration policy, to me, was all about equality for every nationality; it was about treating Europeans and people outside the EU equally. Ukip's rising star Sanya-Jeet Thandi was angry with the party's poster campaign (pictured) which claimed 26 million Europeans wanted British jobs . ‘But the recent racism scandals suggest, it seems, that most other Ukip voters and members support the policy – and the party – for a very different reason.’ ‘Previously fundamental policies like taxation and promoting a small state are being ignored in favour of going after the votes of those who think Lenny Henry ""should emigrate to a black country"".’ Nigel Farage hailed Sanya-Theet Jandi as Ukip's rising star - but she quit today after despairing over the party's bid to win 'racist' voters . Miss Thandi, who grew up in Kent and was born to Punjabi parents, has been a prominent member of UKIP appearing in a party election broadcast last year and speaking twice at its annual conference. Appearing in a YouTube video with Miss Thandi, Mr Farage said: ‘Sanya, you’re 18-years-old and you’re a rising star in the party. At the conference you were the most popular speaker so I’m going to have to watch my step, aren’t I, as time goes on.’ In a newspaper interview, Miss Thandi described Mr Farage a 'a babe' and said Godfrey Bloom was ‘cute and so kind and hilarious, he just says things for the reaction. Lovely guy but a bit misunderstood.’ Ukip has been hit by a string of embarrassing comments from candidates in the last few weeks. One member who featured in the party’s election broadcast was suspended after saying Ed Miliband was ‘not a real Brit’ and describing Islam as an ‘evil organisation’. Another supporter said Lenny Henry, the comedian, should emigrate to a “black country”. Appearing at a rally last week Mr Farage said that ‘there will always be a few people who creep over the line and cause us embarrassment’, but that the party did not welcome those with extremist or offensive views. Standing on stage flanked by black and ethnic minority councillors and candidates, he said: ‘From this moment on please do not ever call us a racist party. We are not a racist party.’","Sanya-Jeet Thandi urges supporters not to vote for party anymore .

Claims Nigel Farage has let party descend into 'form of racist populism'"
"By . Richard Spillett . and John Stevens . As they stroll down a sun-kissed Spanish street, Tony and Cherie Blair appear to be slightly preoccupied. And their distracted air is not all that surprising given that this was the first time in months they have been seen together in public. During that period their marriage has been in the spotlight after allegations of a close relationship between Mr Blair, 60, and Wendi Deng, the former wife of Rupert Murdoch. The media mogul has said he divorced his wife because of claims she was close to the former Prime Minister. Tony Blair and his wife Cherie were pictured walking down a street in Marbella, southern Spain last month . The couple, who have been married more than 30 years, looked relaxed as they enjoyed the Spanish sunshine . The Blairs were . photographed on holiday together in Marbella, Spain just over a week . after Murdoch broke his silence on his and Miss Deng's divorce. It . was alleged in February that Miss Deng, 45, had written notes to . herself praising Mr Blair’s ‘good body’ and his ‘butt’. In a list of . reasons why ‘I’m so missing Tony’, she gushed in poor English about his . ‘pierce blue eyes which I love. Love his eyes. Also I love his power on . the stage’. Although . there is no evidence that Miss Deng had an affair, the 83-year-old . media tycoon said claims that Mr Blair secretly met his wife at their . Californian ranch had played a major role in  his decision to end their . 14-year marriage. In . Marbella, a stern-looking Mrs Blair, 59, opted for leggings under a . floral print dress and sandals as she strolled with her husband. The Blairs were last pictured together in public at Nelson Mandela's Memorial Service in Johannesburg in December . Murdoch said he went straight to a divorce lawyer after hearing claims Blair and Miss Deng had met up while he was away . Mr Blair, 60, his hair thinner and more grey than when he was in power, wore a linen shirt paired with a suit and loafers. The . Blairs were last pictured together at Nelson Mandela's memorial service . in December, following last year's claims Mr Blair's friendship with . Murdoch fell apart over secret meetings between him and Miss Deng. Earlier . this month, Murdoch, 83, confirmed he was prompted to file for divorce . by claims of Miss Deng's closeness to the former Labour party leader. Murdoch . said friends had kept him in the dark over alleged meetings between the . pair at Murdoch's Californian ranch while he was away. He told Fortune magazine in the US: 'Well, you know, everybody was talking about these things and never telling me anything. The Blairs were pictured laughing at their son Euan's wedding last September . ‘Oh, s***, oh, s***.  Whatever why I’m so missing Tony. 'Because he is so charming and his clothes are so good. 'He has such good body and he has really really good legs Butt…And he is slim tall and good skin. 'Pierce blue eyes which I love. Love his eyes. 'Also I love his power on the stage…and what else and what else and what else...’ 'But then I . was told two pretty circumstantial things about the ranch. I was in . Australia. When I got back, I naturally asked staff and it opened up,' Murdoch added. 'That's the story. And then, you know, a week later I filed. As soon as I could find a lawyer.' Although he did not name Mr Blair, his comments tally with claims in Vanity Fair magazine linking Mr Blair to at least two suspicious trysts at the ranch with Miss Deng. It . was alleged in February that Miss Deng, 45, had written notes to . herself in which she praised Mr Blair's 'good body', his 'really, really . good legs' and his 'butt'. It was claimed Blair visited Murdoch's ranch in Carmel, California while Murdoch was away and the media mogul only found out when staff told him . Last year Mr Blair was seen stepping out of a £7,000-an-hour bespoke . aircraft (pictured) complete with stateroom, lounge, kitchen and bed as it emerged he was footing the bill for his own private transport . In a list of reasons why 'I'm so missing Tony', Chinese-born Miss Deng later gushed about his 'blue eyes which I love', it is claimed. Mr Blair, who is godfather to one of Murdoch's daughters, has always denied any affair but has not spoken publicly about the claims. He and Cherie have been married since 1980 and have four children; Euan, 30, Nicky, 28, Kathryn, 26, and Leo, 13. They were together at Euan's marriage to Suzanne Ashman at All Saints parish church in Wotton Underwood, Buckingshire, last September. The Blair's Spanish break comes two years after they last visited the Costa del Sol. In 2012 the couple were pictured visiting a friend's house in Benahavis near Marbella. The holiday is the latest stop in Mr Blair's busy schedule, as he travels the world in his new roles as business consultant and public speaker. In the last year he has been seen disembarking from a £30million private jet at in Bangkok, Sardinia and New York state, and the top-of-the-range Bombardier Global Express private jet has also been seen in Switzerland, Ukraine and Israel on dates which matched Mr Blair’s visits.

"By . Matt Chorley . and Tamara Cohen . The state does not know best how people spend their own money, George Osborne insisted today as he set out details of an overhaul of pensions. People heading into retirement will be able to get their hands on their entire pension pot, instead of having to convert it into a scheme which pays out small amounts each month for the rest of their lives. The Chancellor insisted it was 'about trusting people', and did not mean people would rush out to blow their money on a Lamborghini. Radical changes to pension schemes are unveiled today, allowing people to take out their money when they reach the age of 55 and spend it as they wish. The shake-up, which was a centrepiece of the Budget in March, means 18 million pensioners will be able to vary their retirement incomes under personalised annuities. From next April, no one will have to buy an annuity, a product from insurance companies which gives pensioners a guaranteed annual income for life. Instead they will be able to withdraw a lump sum. The scheme was first mooted in the March Budget, when Pensions Minister Steve Webb controversially said people should be free to blow their pensions on buying a Lamborghini if they wanted to. Mr Osborne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It’s all about saying to people ""look, you have saved through your lives, you have worked hard for these savings, you should have freedom over how you access them and I want to make sure you're in possession of all the best information before you make those choices'. Millions of people will get free, impartial advice on how to make the most of their retirement savings. The guidance will be delivered by a range of independent organisations, including The Pensions Advisory Service (TPAS) and the Money Advice Service (MAS) and follows concerns consumers would not trust information given by organisations with a vested interest in selling a financial product or service. Mr Osborne added: 'We’re talking about trusting people here. It’s not my money, it’s your money, this is the money of people who have worked hard and saved hard. 'Of course, I want to make sure that they have the right information available to them. 'But we have to get away from this patronising view that the state knows best how people should spend their own money and that's what this fundamental reform of pensions is all about.' Last night, pension experts cautiously welcomed the changes, because annuity products have offered poor value in recent years. But they stressed that everyone should be offered free financial advice to fully understand the implications. Ministers said such advice would be funded by a levy on the financial sector and would be impartial – not from the pension provider. In the small print of the consultation released yesterday, the Treasury said it will be offered ‘through a broad range of channels, including web-based, phone-based as well as face-to-face’. Currently those who retire can take a lump sum of 25 per cent out of their pot tax-free. Under the new system, they will still face paying tax if they take it all out at once. But under changes being planned in the Treasury, deals will be available allowing cash sums to be taken out later in life to meet sudden needs, such as social care. It is thought the shake-up will allow 18million pensioners to vary their retirement incomes. File photo . The Chancellor said: ‘We’re making sure that people have the right support to make their own choice about how best to finance their retirement.’ Advice will be offered by special advice services, not companies which sell financial products, and be regulated by the Financial conduct Authority. Pensions expert Ros Altmann said the pension changes would ‘give consumers more choice and more control.’ She added: ‘For the first time pension savers will be free to choose what to do with their retirement funds. The decision that guidance must be impartial and separate from the industry is a real game changer.’","Chancellor made radical changes the centrepiece of his budget in March .

"By . Matt Chorley . and Tamara Cohen . A major coalition row erupted today over Lib Dem plans to overhaul the so-called 'bedroom tax'. Nick Clegg was forced to insist he was not calling for it to be scrapped - despite reports he would axe it - but instead wanted changes to be made to the details. But the Tories claimed he had never discussed the problems in private meetings, and pointed out that he had spent months defending the policy in public. The Lib Dems will now argue that the policy where working-age people who live in council housing and have spare rooms pay more must be changed. The move creates a rift with the Lib Dems’ Conservative coalition partners who support the measure. Last year Mr Clegg defended the policy in the House of Commons, telling a Labour MP that it would help the 1.8million people on the list waiting for a council house. He said that there was a ‘mismatch’ in the benefits system between people needing a place to live and empty  bedrooms’, and even accused Labour of ‘baulking’ at taking tough decisions. But last night it was claimed Mr Clegg no longer believes the policy works and will – like Labour – vow to reverse it ahead of next year’s general election. Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, drove through the removal of the spare room subsidy last April. He said he hoped it would make people with spare bedrooms downsize. An academic study this week found that in the first six months of the policy, 4.5 per cent of those affected had downsized to a smaller property, which the ministry said was a ‘promising start’. Writing in today’s Mirror newspaper, Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Chief Secretary  to the Treasury, said:  ‘Overwhelmingly, our benefit reforms are working, resulting in many more people gaining the independence and self-respect of re-entering work. 'However with only one in 20 of affected claimants having successfully downsized, it’s clearly time to take stock and change our approach in this particular area.’ He said many people living in social housing were disabled or had other needs and could not find a smaller property. Several Lib Dem MPs have already come out against the policy. But a Conservative spokesman said: 'The Lib Dems have never demanded the restoration of the spare room subsidy in private; and have campaigned for its abolition in public. 'Bringing the bloated Housing Benefit bill bill under control is a key part of our long term plan to fix welfare. 'Our reforms are working - and it's imperative we stick to them. The Conservatives are committed to this.' And during his weekly radio phone-in, Mr Clegg was forced to clarify that he was not adopting Labour's stance of axing the policy altogether. Mr Clegg told LBC 97.3: 'Unlike Labour, we are not sticking our heads in the sand. Of course you need to do something about housing benefit reform, of course you have to do something about overcrowding. Unlike the Conservatives, we want to do it as fairly as possible. 'The real trigger was that we published a report, commissioned by the Government itself, which simply showed it wasn't working in the way that was intended. 'I'm a practical man. I think that when something isn't working in the way that you planned for it to work, you fix it.' Mr Clegg added that it was 'complete baloney' for the Conservatives to claim that they were surprised by the Lib Dem announcement: 'I've been constantly badgering away within Government with the DWP to try to make sure we really stress-test this properly. Scroll down for video . Change of heart: Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury,  (left) said it was time to change the approach to the spare room subsidy, introduced by Iain Duncan Smith (right) last April . Last February, Mr Clegg said: ‘The . problem you cannot duck is that we have 1.8million households in this . country who are waiting to get social housing provision and we have one . million bedrooms which are standing empty. ‘That . doesn’t make sense to have a benefits system that continues to support . this mismatch between people needing places to live and empty bedrooms. That is what we are trying to address.’ A senior Labour source said last night: ‘The Lib Dems are utter hypocrites. They have supported this policy for four years.’ Rules: Since April 2013, if a person of working age had a spare bedroom they cannot claim housing benefit for all their rent . This week Mr Duncan Smith said his department’s reforms to housing benefit had saved £6billion a year and the criticism of them had been ‘wildly exaggerated’. Since April 2013, if a person of working age had a spare bedroom they cannot claim housing benefit for all their rent. Tenants have to pay an extra 14 per cent if they have one spare bedroom, and 25 per cent for two. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: 'We spend around £24bn a year on housing benefit so we have a safety net in place. 'However It was simply wrong that the taxpayer was paying for social housing tenants to have spare bedrooms when around 300,000 people were living in overcrowded homes and around 1.7 million were on social housing waiting lists in England alone when the policy came into force. 'Especially because this rule already applies to housing benefit claimants in the private sector – introduced by the previous government. 'We have made £345m available to councils to help vulnerable people with the changes - including disabled people'.","Nick Clegg reverses on Coalition policy over so-called 'bedroom tax'

"By . James Chapman . and Matt Chorley . Britain's leading aid charity is facing an inquiry by watchdogs after launching  an extraordinary attack on the Coalition’s austerity measures. Oxfam infuriated Conservative MPs by unveiling a mock film poster on Twitter, accusing the Government of creating a  ‘perfect storm’ – involving high prices,  unemployment, zero-hours contracts and childcare costs – that is ‘forcing more and more people into poverty’. Charities are barred by law from political campaigning and Tory MP Conor Burns said he had asked the Charity Commission to launch an urgent investigation. The Oxfam Twitter advert has been criticised by Tory MPs who warned the charity would lose support . A spokesman for the watchdog said it had begun an assessment – a first stage of a process which could lead to full inquiry. A . Government source rejected the claims by Oxfam. He said: ‘I think . they’ll find unemployment is falling, that we’ve just taken action over . zero-hour contracts, and that there was a Childcare Bill in the Queen’s . Speech which will offer tax-free childcare to all parents with kids . under 12 by autumn 2015 and cover 85 per cent of childcare costs of . those families receiving universal credit.’ Mr Burns said: ‘Most of us operated under the illusion that Oxfam’s focus was on the relief of poverty and famine overseas. ‘I cannot see how using funds donated to charity to campaign politically can be in accord with Oxfam’s charitable status.’ Tory MP Conor Burns condemned the 'foolish' campaign which he said would lose Oxfam support . ‘This has lost you a lot of supporters. Very foolish.’ He has now written to the Charities Commission requesting an investigation into the ‘overtly political’ attack on ‘the policies of the current Government’. He questions whether the advert is breach of Oxfam's charitable status. The Conservatives are particularly angry at the inclusion of unemployment and high prices in the list. 'This has lost you a lot of supporters. Very foolish'Conor Burns, MP . According to the latest figures, unemployment is down by more than 400,000 in the last two years. Inflation has also fallen in recent months, with wages now rising at the same rate as prices. Therese Coffey, a Tory MP, accused Oxfam of using ‘anecdote to create alarmist generalisations’. Tory MP Dan Byles said: ‘Oxfam is a charity. They are barred by law from political campaigning.’ But Ben Phillips, Oxfam campaigns and policy director, said: ""Oxfam is a resolutely non-party political organisation - we have a duty to draw attention to the hardship suffered by poor people we work with in the UK. ""Fighting poverty should not be a party political issue - successive governments have presided over a tide of rising inequality and created a situation where food banks and other providers provided 20 million meals last year to people who could not afford to feed themselves. ""This is an unacceptable situation in one of the world's largest economies and politicians of all stripes have a responsibility to tackle it.""","Tory MPs slam 'foolish' campaign and warn it will cost the charity support .

"By . Matt Chorley . and Sophie Borland . The NHS operates on the wrong body part once a week, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt admitted today as he warned one in five hospitals is not being honest about the scale of medical blunders. Mr Hunt revealed that 29 NHS trusts are under-recording the number of serious errors and near misses that occur due to mistakes by staff. He said it was 'not acceptable' that preventable mistakes are made, which cause patients and families ‘immeasurable harm’ and cost the health service £800million annually in extra treatment and legal bills. Concerns: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will warn that 29 NHS trusts are under-recording the number of serious errors and near misses that occur due to mistakes by staff . It is estimated that as many as 12,500 patients die every year following mistakes by NHS staff and there are an average of six ‘never events’ every week. They include one woman who had her fallopian tube removed instead of her appendix, leaving her potentially infertile, while another patient had the wrong toe amputated. Mr Hunt is today ordering hospitals to drastically improve their safety record and also ensure they are more honest about mistakes. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Once a week we operate on the wrong part of someone’s body, and that is not acceptable. 'This is really a very big moment because we have identified that the key to this is having an open and honest reporting culture.' In a speech announcing his plans today, he says: ‘The NHS is leading the world in achieving new safety standards but the battle to reduce avoidable harm is constant. ‘Unsafe care causes immeasurable harm to patients and their families, and also costs the NHS millions in litigation claims.’ All hospitals are meant to alert the NHS’s National Reporting and Learning System whenever a patient dies, comes to harm or there is a near miss as a result of mistakes by staff. Errors: It is estimated that as many as 12,500 patients die every year following mistakes by NHS staff and there are an average of six 'never events' every week (file picture) But an analysis by Department of Health has identified that 29 of 130 the hospital trusts in England are not always reporting these errors – known as Patient Safety Incidents. Officials compared the number of incidents which would be expected at a trust -based on its size and vulnerability of patients – with those actually reported. 'Unsafe care causes immeasurable harm to patients and their families, and also costs the NHS millions in litigation claims' Jeremy Hunt, Health Secretary . A total of 18 per cent of 130 hospital trusts in England were deemed to be ‘good’ at reporting errors, 62 per cent ‘okay’ and 20 per cent ‘poor’. As part of the measures announced today, patients will be able to check the safety of their own hospital with others nearby on the NHS Choices website. Each trust will be rated ‘good’, ‘okay’ or ‘poor’ on a number of measures including how well they prevent infections, falls and pressure ulcers. The information is expected to be available later today. Hospitals are also being told to draw up plans to reduce pressure ulcers, medication errors and two other categories of preventable harm of their own choice. Ministers hope that the measures will save at least 6,000 patients lives from unnecessary harm over the next three years. One of the safest: Staff at Salford Royal (pictured), in Greater Manchester, ask patients if they need help getting out of bed and also check they are not wearing slippers or shoes that may cause them to fall . One trust believed to be one of the safest in the NHS which has drastically reduced the level of harm is Salford Royal, in Greater Manchester. Staff ask patients if they need help getting out of bed and also check they are not wearing slippers or shoes that may cause them to fall. 'Healthcare carries inherent risk and while healthcare professionals work hard every day to reduce this risk every day, harm still happens. Some is unavoidable but most isn’t' Sir David Dalton, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust chief executive . Senior managers carry out unannounced safety ward-rounds once a week to inspect whether patients are liable to come to harm through falls, bedsores or lack of care. Since the measures were introduced in 2008, the trust claims to have reduced infections by 70 per cent, falls by 50 per cent and bedsores by 40 per cent. Sir David Dalton, chief executive of the trust who has been put in charge of this new safety campaign said: ‘This is the right thing to do. ‘Healthcare carries inherent risk and while healthcare professionals work hard every day to reduce this risk every day, harm still happens. Some is unavoidable but most isn’t.’ In 2007 study by the now defunct NHS Patient Safety Agency estimated that mistakes due to medication alone cost the health service £774 million a year in legal fees and necessary treatment.","He said errors are causing patients and families 'immeasurable harm'

"By . Matt Chorley . and Richard Spillett . David Cameron today stepped in to order an end to an extraordinary public feud between Theresa May and Michael Gove. It follows Mrs May, the Home Secretary, launching a thinly-veiled attack on Education Secretary Mr Gove over his handling of the Trojan Horse schools scandal. Downing Street today insisted that the two departments had been told to focus on tackling Islamic extremism in schools, and stop briefing against each other. Home Secretary Theresa May (left) has called for tougher controls on extremism in schools in a letter to Education Secretary Michael Gove (right) following the alleged 'Trojan Horse' plot in Birmingham . In a letter . to Mr Gove, Mrs May called for tougher rules to tackle . Islamic extremism in schools and asked why action was not taken sooner. A . total of 21 schools in Birmingham have been inspected since allegations . that Muslim hardliners were attempting to seize control of school . boards in the city. After police, Ofsted and Department of Education launched investigations, a letter emerged in which Mrs May appeared to question Mr Gove's response. She wrote: 'Is it true that Birmingham City Council was warned about these allegations in 2008? Is it true that the Department for Education was warned in 2010? If so, why did nobody act? 'I am aware that several investigations are still ongoing and those investigations are yet to conclude. But it is clear to me that we will need to take clear action to improve the quality of staffing and governance if we are to prevent extremism in schools.' It triggered an immediate trading of insults from rival sources in the two government departments. A source close to Mr Gove complained of a reluctance by the Home Office to tackle the problem. 'Tony Blair recognised this space. Within government there has been pushback against doing that. 'Charles Farr [counter-terror chief at the Home Office] always believed if extremists become violent we should deal with it. 'It has been characterised by others in government as just beating back the crocodiles that come close to the boat rather than draining the swamp,' the source told The Times. The between two senior Tories row is tricky for David Cameron, who hoped to focus on the Queen's Speech . But a Home Office source hit back: 'Why is the DfE wanting to blame other people for information they had in 2010? Lord knows what more they have overlooked on the subject of the protection of kids in state schools? It scares me.' In an attempt to calm the row, the two departments were ordered to issue a joint statement, saying: 'Extremism anywhere in society is a serious problem and we are working . together across Government to deal with it. 'That was shown by the work . of the Prime Minister’s Extremism Taskforce. There is no difference . between the Education Secretary and the Home Secretary, who are both . working energetically together to tackle the challenge posed by any form . of extremism.' In a sign of Number 10's irritation, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman added: 'What the two departments are doing, as their statement this morning says, is working together to get to the bottom of this. 'The important thing here is getting to the bottom of serious concerns that have been raised with regard to a number of schools in the Birmingham area. That is the focus, and rightly so.' A government task force on tackling extremism last year recommended a voluntary code of conduct to prevent children being exposed to 'intolerant or extremist views' in religious schools. But Mrs May said the Birmingham allegations showed the potential need for a mandatory code and urged Mr Gove to include that option in his plans. Mrs May wrote: '[Since] December there have . been serious allegations of extremism in some Birmingham schools and . accusations about the inability of local and central government to . tackle the problem effectively. Park View school, which is at the centre of some of the most serious allegations, has criticised the 'unwarranted and unnecessary concern' caused by leaks from the investigation . 'In . this context, I am not convinced that a voluntary code is sufficient . and I believe it would be sensible to include the option of developing a . mandatory code in your consultation document.' Mrs May said the Birmingham allegations . 'raise serious questions about the quality of school governance and . oversight arrangements in the maintained sector, not just the . supplementary schools that would be signatories to this code of . practice'. Mrs May and Mr Gove moved to damp down speculation over a row within the Cabinet today, issuing a joint statement. The so-called Trojan Horse plot first came to light earlier this year. Department for Education inspectors were ordered into Park View School in Birmingham along with its sister schools, Golden Hillock and Nansen, after a letter dubbed 'Trojan Horse' was uncovered. It is alleged girls at the school were forced to sit at the back of the classroom and non-Muslim pupils forced to 'teach themselves'. The letter, which some have claimed is fake, prompted separate investigations by both the Department for Education (DfE) and Ofsted in to the school and several others in the area. The DfE has also appointed its own education commissioner, the former head of the Metropolitan Police’s counter-terrorism unit Peter Clarke for the investigation. The National Association of Head Teachers said it had ‘serious concerns’ about attempts to ‘alter the character’ of at least six schools - warning the 'plot' was spreading across the country. It . said: 'The Department for Education and the Home Office take the . problems in Birmingham schools and all issues relating to extremism very . seriously. 'Michael . Gove and Theresa May are working together to ensure we get to the . bottom of what has happened in Birmingham and take the necessary steps . to fix it.' And a source close to the Education Secretary said: 'Michael Gove thinks Theresa May is a superb Home Secretary. 'We will continue to work well with the Home Office and other Government departments to combat extremism in all its forms.' Of the 21 schools inspected over the . alleged Trojan Horse plot by hardline Muslims to seize control of . classrooms, three have so far been given a clean bill of health by . Ofsted. Ninestiles . School, an Academy in Acocks Green, Small Heath School, and Washwood . Heath Academy are the first to publish the results of their . inspections, after Mr Gove sent Ofsted in. Park View school has been the focus of the most damning allegations after whistleblowing teachers claimed the school was in the hands of a group of extremists who infiltrated the governing body. But Park View trust, which runs the school and three others in the . city, has denied any wrong-doing. Trust chairman Tahir Alam, who was accused of being part of the plot, has called the allegations 'a witch-hunt'. The school said leaked Ofsted findings were causing 'unwarranted and unnecessary concern' for children and parents. Tahir Alam, who has been implicated in the conspiracy involving the alleged takeover of schools in Birmingham, has called the investigation a 'witch-hunt' It came as 20 educationalists said the snap inspections called after the claims had 'tarnished' Ofsted's reputation. In a letter to the Guardian, a group of experts including Sir Tim Brighouse, a former chief education officer, said: 'First-hand accounts of the Ofsted inspections that have emerged are disturbing. 'They suggest that inspectors were poorly prepared and had an agenda that calls into question Ofsted's claim to be objective and professional in its appraisal of standards in schools serving predominately Muslim pupils. 'It is beyond belief that schools which were judged less than a year ago to be outstanding are now widely reported as ""inadequate"", despite having the same curriculum, the same students, the same leadership team and the same governing body.' I am writing in response to your letter to the Prime Minister seeking approval to launch a public consultation on a voluntary Code of Practice for supplementary schools.The publication of a Code of Practice for supplementary schools was an agreed Extremism Task Force commitment and we agreed at the conclusion of the ETF’s work that the Code should be voluntary. However, since the publication of the ETF report in December there have been serious allegations of extremism in some Birmingham schools and accusations about the inability of local and central government to tackle the problem effectively. In this context, I am not convinced that a voluntary code is sufficient and I believe it would be sensible to include the option of developing a mandatory code in your consultation document. I understand and share your desire to include a clear and unambiguous definition of extremism and of Islamist extremism, and indeed I was pleased that we were able to agree the latter in the ETF report. It is important that having agreed these definitions we now stick to them in the Code of Practice to avoid any confusion. We . know that extremists try to impose specific forms of dress on people . and this includes the mandatory veiling of women. The consultation . document should be clear that nobody should be forced to dress in a . particular way. We do, however, need to recognise that many moderate . Muslims, as well as people of other religions, believe that covering . one’s hair is a religious requirement and some parents will therefore . want their children to do so. The text on dress requirements should . therefore not be part of the extremism definition but, consistent with . the Government’s already-stated position on the burqa, we should state . clearly that nobody should be forced to dress in a particular way. The . allegations relating to schools in Birmingham raise serious questions . about the quality of school governance and oversight arrangements in the . maintained sector, not just the supplementary schools that would be . signatories to this Code of Practice. How did it come to pass, for . example, that one of the governors at Park View was the chairman of the . education committee of the Muslim Council of Britain? Is it true that . Birmingham City Council was warned about these allegations in 2008? Is . it true that the Department for Education was warned in 2010? If so, why . did nobody act? I am aware that several investigations are still . ongoing and those investigations are yet to conclude. But it is clear to . me that we will need to take clear action to improve the quality of . staffing and governance if we are to prevent extremism in schools.I am copying this letter to other members of the Extremism Taskforce.The Rt Hon Theresa May MP .","Investigation launched into claims school boards taken over by radicals .

"By . Matt Chorley . and Jonathon Hopkins . Britain is 'getting back to work', David Cameron declared today as the number of people in a job soared by the highest figure since records began. Employment levels rose by 283,000 in the last three months - the largest quarterly increase in 43 years. The proportion of women in work reached 67.7 per cent, a new record high, as total unemployment fell by 133,000 to 2.2million in the three months to March, the lowest level since January 2009. There are a record 30.430million people in work, up by 283,000 on the end of last year . Female employment rates hit 67.7 per cent, a new high, according to the Office for National Statistics . More than 30.4million people are now in work - the highest since records began in 1971 - while self-employment has also reached a record high of 4.5million. The number of people working for themselves jumped by 183,000 in the quarter to March, compared with a rise of 375,000 over the past year. Other data from the ONS showed that jobseeker's allowance claimants fell by 25,100 in April to 1.12 million, the 18th consecutive monthly reduction. Meanwhile, pay growth rose more than inflation for the first time since 2010 but was below forecasts. Average earnings, including bonuses, increased by 1.7 per cent in the year to March, slightly ahead of the latest CPI inflation rate of 1.6 per cent. Economists had expected pay to grow by 2.1 per cent. The number of economically-inactive people fell by 85,000 in the latest quarter to 8.85 million, while long-term and youth unemployment also fell. The number of people in a job rose 283,000 in the last three months - the largest quarterly increase in 43 years. David Cameron highlighted the figures during Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, saying: 'We are getting the country back to work.' The number of unemployed young people has been falling for the last eight months, . David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘The figures continue to demonstrate the flexibility and resilience of the jobs market, which is a source of strength for the economy. It is also good news that we are now seeing positive increases in earnings, easing the squeeze on living standards. ‘Although there are still some concerns, with youth and long term unemployment particularly high, the recovery is clearly moving ahead.’ Prime Minister David Cameron said the figures proved Britain is getting back to work after the recession . Minister for Employment Esther McVey said: ‘As the recovery takes hold, more people are able to get a job or set up their own business and become the employers of tomorrow. 'Each and every person who has made a new start or hired someone new is helping to make Britain a more prosperous and confident place to be. 'We will continue to support those in and out of work who want to get on and fulfil their ambitions for a more secure future.' The number of people out of work for over a year was down by 32,000 to 813,000, with unemployment among 16 to 24-year-olds falling by 48,000 to 868,000, the lowest figure for five years. Unemployment has fallen by more than 300,000 over the past year, giving jobless rates of 7 per cent for men and 6.4 per cent for women. Total pay is up by 1.7 per cent, while the CPI rate of inflation is at 1.6 per cent . The jobless data came just ahead of the publication of the latest Bank of England quarterly inflation report, which saw the bank sharply sharply revise down its expectations on unemployment, predicting that the rate would fall to 5.9 per cent in two years. The BoE also forecast GDP to grow by 3.4 per cent this year - unchanged from its previous prediction - but increased the target for next year from 2.7 per cent to 2.9 per cent. However, the forecast for 2016 has fallen from 2.9 per cent to 2.8 per cent Bank of England governor Mark Carney said: ‘The UK economy continues to perform strongly. The economy has started to head back towards normal.’ The BoE’s latest forecast could add to expectations that UK interest rates will go up before next year's general election, although offsetting that pressure was the Bank’s prediction that inflation will remain at or below its 2 per cent target for the next three years. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club said: ‘Employment grew by 0.9 per cent in the three months to March, above the estimated 0.8 per cent rise in GDP. ‘So it looks like output per worker fell slightly in Q1, but we still anticipate a recovery in productivity and pay growth over the next year. ‘Those fearing that the economic recovery will be accompanied by a surge in inflation driven by rapid wage increases look increasingly wide of the mark.’ The number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK is up by almost 26 per cent year-on-year, compared to 1.8 per cent for people born in the UK. The Bank’s original version of its forward guidance policy – under which it said it would not think about raising borrowing costs until Britain’s jobless rate fell to 7 per cent - was swiftly rendered obsolete by the plunge in unemployment which began last year. The BoE said in February it expected unemployment would fall to 6.9 percent in the January-March period. On currency markets, the pound fell back to 1.6781 versus the US dollar, its lowest level since April 29, and also weakened against the euro after the data. Kathleen Brooks, research director UK EMEA at FOREX.com: ‘The market is getting used to better than expected economic news out of the UK, which may be one reason why the pound sold off even though the UK’s unemployment rate for March fell to its lowest level since early 2009. ‘The most disappointing part of the report was wages,’ she added. ‘Although headline wage growth is still above CPI, the fact that wages made no headway in March suggests that the recent increase was a flash in the pan, and not the sign of a sustained trend.’","Unemployment fell by 133,000 to 2.2million in the three months to March .

"By . Matt Chorley . The government has written off England's World Cup chances even before the team has boarded the plane to Brazil. David Cameron’s plans to relax drinking laws during games have been based on the assumption that Roy Hodsgon’s side will not progress far beyond the group stages. The Home Office has decided there is a ‘high probability’ that England will not make it into the knock out games, so the impact of extended pub opening hours will be limited. Scroll down for video . THe boss: Roy Hodgson has named his 23 man squad for the World Cup in Brazil . The damning assessment emerged just as Hodgson unveiled his 23-man squad which he hopes will take him to World Cup glory. Mr Cameron overruled the Home Office to insist that pubs should be allowed to open when the Three Lions were in action this summer. But the details of the plan reveal how Whitehall is pessimistic about England’s chances in Brazil. The official impact assessment on late-night drinking says there is a ‘high probability’ the squad will not play in ‘later matches’. Just yesterday Hodgson confirmed he will be taking a side packed with young talent as England bid for their first world title since 1966. The squad includes young midfielders Ross Barkley, Jordan Henderson and Jack Wilshere in the 23-man squad. But Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick was left out, less than two years after he was tempted out of international retirement by the England manager. Ashley Cole and Jermain Defoe - with 162 caps between them - were the other most senior internationals jettisoned. Fans flocking to pubs to watch England play could boost the industry by £20million, the British Beer and Pub Association has claimed. Star man: Wayne Rooney is one of the key strikers in Roy Hodgson's 23-man squad . Young Lions: Raheem Sterling is one of several young players included in England's charge for Brazil . Back in action: Jack Wilshere has been named despite a lengthy spell out with injury . But while they will be hoping for victory, Whitehall was rather more pessmistics  when drawing up rules on extending licensing for matches kicking off throughout the night due to time-zone differences. The impact assessment said: ‘While England are certain to be playing in the matches in the first period, there is a high probability that they will not be playing in the later matches.’ The Home Office has decided there is a ¿high probability¿ that England will not make it into the knock out games . The gloomy predictions are based on bookies odds, officials said. ‘We have used odds from Betfair.com13 implying that England have a 54% probability of progressing past the group stage and an 11 per cent probability of progressing past the quarter-finals, allowing us to estimate the expected benefits.’ Labour's Lord Rosser highlighted the comments, saying: ‘So it's good to know what the Government thinks of England's prospects.' Home Office minister Lord Taylor of Holbeach said the comments in the paper were 'a matter of opinion'. He added: 'I'm sure other peers will have different views on that issue.’ A Home Office spokeswoman said: ‘Because we want everyone to get behind the England football team this summer, the Government has extended licensing hours so fans can watch England games in pubs. ‘As part of the process for changing licensing hours, the Government is obliged to carry out a formal impact assessment. ‘As part of that assessment, officials used odds from Betfair to estimate the probability of England playing in the knock-out stages. 'The Government is of course 100% behind the England football team and we wish the players every success in the World Cup.’","Assumption that Roy Hodsgon’s side will not progress beyond group stages .

"By . Matt Chorley . and James Rush . Barclays today took the axe to its controversial investment banking division, saying it would sack thousands of highly-paid bankers. A total of 7,000 jobs will go in its investment division, including more than 2,000 in the UK, marking the end of an era for the high-stakes casino banking which defined the financial crisis. The  'bold simplification' plan will cut a total of 19,000 staff around the world by 2016, including ditching its European chain of high street banks in Portugal, Spain, Italy and France. The dramatic shake-up from the great survivor of the banking crash comes after its profits fell earlier this year - but at the same time it came under fire for raising bonuses by 10 per cent. Scroll down for video . Barclays has announced it is to axe 7,000 jobs from its investment banking division by 2016 . In a statement to the stock market, Barclays said its business ‘will be repositioned, simplified and rebalanced’. Shares rose by 3.5 per cent in early trading this morning. The bloodletting at the investment arm is likely to see dozens of millionaire bankers shown the door. The smaller bank will focus on its high street operation and underwriting bonds and shares. Chief executive Antony Jenkins made clear he hopes the changes will draw a line under a turbulent period for the bank. He said: ‘We will be a focused international bank, operating only in areas where we have capability, scale and competitive advantage. ‘In the future, Barclays will be leaner, stronger, much better balanced and well positioned to deliver lower volatility, higher returns, and growth. ‘My goal is unchanged: to create a Barclays that does business in the right way, with the right values, and delivers the returns that our shareholders deserve.’ The move is a major change for the company which became notorious for its so-called ‘casino banking’ under its former chief executive Bob Diamond. While Barclays survived the financial crisis without a taxpayer-funded bailout - unlike RBS and Lloyds - it did not escape the wrath of politicians. David Cameron led a furious attack on the culture of the bank after it admitted traders had manipulated key interest rates. At height of the libor rate-fixing scandal, the Prime Minister blasted: 'People have to take responsibility for the actions and show how they're going to be accountable for these actions. 'It's very important that goes all the way to the top of the organisation.' Mr Diamond resigned days later, to be replaced by Mr Jenkins who has spent two years overhauling the firm. Chief executive Antony Jenkins said the bank will axe a total of 19,000 staff around the world by 2016 in a radical shake-up which comes after its profits fell earlier this year . In 2008 it was forced to seek a bailout from the Middle East as its investments division threatened to drag the whole bank down in the same way as the Royal Bank of Scotland and other British banks. The changes will see Barclays hive off its European retail banking business into a so-called 'bad bank', comprising £115 billion of 'non-core' assets. The non-core unit groups together businesses which do not fit the bank's 'strategic objectives' or profitability criteria under the review and the bank will 'look to exit or run down these assets over time', it said. Mr Jenkins said: 'This is a bold simplification of Barclays. We will be a focused international bank, operating only in areas where we have capability, scale and competitive advantage. 'In the future, Barclays will be leaner, stronger, much better balanced and well-positioned to deliver lower volatility, higher returns and growth.' Former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond with players of Chelsea FC receiving the Premier League trophy at Stamford Bridge in 2005 . Ex-Barclays boss Bob Diamond became the face of the City's defiance in the wake of the financial crisis . The spectacle of millionaire investment bankers being told to clear their desks by Barclays marks the end of the era at the bank personified by Bob Diamond. One of the world's richest and most successful bankers, the high-flying American was once described as the 'unacceptable face of banking' by Lord Mandelson. As the head of Barclays Capital he built the investment division so dramatically that Barclays was one of the few banks not to have to be bailed out by the taxpayer.A controversial figure, he became chief executive of Barclays in January 2011 with a salary of £1.3million and repeated rows about the size of his bonuses. But within days he sparked outrage with a claim that four years after the financial crisis, bankers could stop apologising for their role in the disaster. 'There was a period of remorse and apology for banks and I think that period needs to be over,' he told MPs. But he quit in 2012 in the wake of explosive revelations of interest rate-rigging. Investment banking has been heavily criticised for its large bonuses and appearance of irresponsibility. Finance director Tushar Morzaria announced on Tuesday that about 450 directors and managing directors had been made redundant in the first quarter as it was revealed profits had fallen by five per cent. In February the bank faced criticism after it was announced staff in its investment arm will get an average bonus of £60,100 per employee for 2013, despite the lender unveiling a 32 per cent drop in underlying annual profits. The group hiked its bonus pool by 10 per cent to £2.4billion for last year. It said its investment banking staff would share £1.57billion in bonuses, up 13 per cent from £1.39billion in 2012. It was the investment banking sector which produced the financial devices which underpinned a boom in the American ‘sub-prime’ property market and which then threatened the whole global financial system with crash in 2008 when the US housing market started to fall. The . bank has already announced job losses across the group of 12,000 for . this year, but this has been increased to 14,000 as a result of the . investment bank changes announced today. It brings the total cuts by . 2016 to 19,000. It comes two . days after Barclays announced that first quarter earnings from the . division fell by half, meaning profits at the group slid by 5 per cent. The changes will dramatically shrink the importance of the investment bank, which currently accounts for more than half of Barclays' size, to no more than 30 per cent by 2016. This division employed around 26,200 staff - around 10,000 in the UK - at the end of last year, but this had already shrunk to about 24,000 over the start of 2014. Barclays did not give a breakdown of where the axe would fall when it announced 12,000 job cuts earlier this year. But with more than 2,000 gone from the investment bank this year already and 7,000 more announced today, the investment bank looks likely to have shrunk by 10,000 or more - from its size at the end of last year - by 2016. Highly paid staff at the division have been at the centre of controversy at Barclays, which last month received a bloody nose from shareholders as it hiked the staff bonus pool by 10% to £2.38 billion last year despite profits falling by a third. The Institute of Directors has complained that this was nearly three times the £859 million paid out in dividends to shareholders. Dominic Hook, Unite national officer, said: 'These have been extraordinarily turbulent times for ordinary Barclays workers who have worked hard to keep the bank on track against a backdrop of continued uncertainty and redundancies. 'The bank needs to recognise their tireless work to put customers first while jobs have been lost and give reassurances over their futures.'","Radical shake-up at Barclays comes after bank's profits fell earlier this year .

"By . Becky Barrow . and Matt Chorley . Families have resorted to 'panic buying' houses because of a shortage of properties on the market, estate agents warned today. Britain’s housing crisis, which is being fuelled by the lack of homes available to buy, is ‘getting worse’, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said. It comes as three former Chancellors warned George Osborne's Help to Buy Scheme is at risk of inflating a new housing bubble. House prices are ballooning as fewer properties come on to the market, coupled with huge demand which has seen estate agents sell an average of 23 properties in the last three months . The number of homes coming on to the market has been falling since the beginning of the year, the first time that four consecutive monthly falls have taken place since 2000. But the average number of homes sold by an estate agent over the last three months has hit 23, the highest number for six years. RICS said the cost of buying a home is ballooning because there are too few homes available to buy and too few new ones being built with estate agents warning of ‘panic buying’. The report, published today, says homebuyers are being crippled by ‘a constrained property market which continues to be marred by weak supply and high demand.’ Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at RICS, said: ‘The critical issue for the market remains the lack of second hand supply. ‘Our numbers suggest that the picture is, if anything, getting worse.’ Its members predict house prices will rise by six per cent every year for the next five years. The average price of a home in the UK is currently £183,600, according to the Nationwide. If it rises by six per cent a year, it will be around £240,000 in five years’ time. Mr Rubinsohn added: ‘Clearly, the absence of properties to buy will ultimately be a factor in influencing the ability of people to move homes.’ Experts warn that the property boom is not just taking place in London (pictured) but could spread across the country, with prices set to rise in the North West and East Anglia . Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson warned demand is rising faster than the supply of new homes can be increased . Three ex-Chancellors have warned George Osborne his flagship mortgage scheme risks inflating a new housing bubble. Labour's Alistair Darling and Tories Norman Lamont and Nigel Lawson said the Help to Buy scheme, guaranteeing loans for people with small deposits, could backfire. It follows a warning from the OECD economic think tank this week that new rules were needed to limit the size of mortgages. Lord Lamont, chancellor under John Major, told the Financial Times: 'What will happen is that demand can be increased quickly, through measures like Help to Buy, but supply can only be increased slowly. 'My concern is that it will become even harder for young people to buy a home in the future.' Mr Darling said: 'We keep repeating the same mistakes,” he said. “Supply of housing is the biggest single thing. Unless supply can be increased substantially, we will exacerbate that situation with schemes like Help to Buy.' Lord Lawson suggestedthe scheme should be limited to properties worth £300,000, instead of £600,000. A Treasury spokesman said: 'We’re dealing with a very specific issue in addressing a market failure after the financial crisis, which has been about affordability and availability of mortgages.” RICS, which conducts a monthly investigation of the housing market, said it is not just London, but the whole the country, where house prices are rising. There is ‘a broadening out in the recovery away from the capital', it said, and singled out the North West and East Anglia as two regions where house prices are expected to rise. Estate agents warn of the problem that they are facing due to the huge demand from buyers, but the lack of people prepared to sell their home. One agent from Portsmouth, said: ‘Major lack of supply is causing panic buying in two and three bedroom house market at present.’ One agent, from Norwich, said: ‘Lack of supply continues to restrict the market.’ Another agent, also from Portsmouth, said: ‘A shortage of instructions is affecting the market. Prices are inflated due to lack of choice.’ An agent, from Pimlico, London, said: ‘Prices continue to increase but stock levels are still depleted. ‘Some astonishing asking prices are being quoted on occasion, just because they can. This is unhelpful.’ The RICS report comes after the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the respected think-tank, raised its fears about Britain’s housing market over-heating. Last week, Sir Jon Cunliffe, one of the Bank of England’s two deputy governors, said he is not aware of any other country, except Australia, which even has a word for ‘gazumping.’ This is when a seller accepts one offer but later decides to turn it down in favour of a higher offer from a rival bidder. He said: ‘There will always be a number of blinking warning lights - risks generated at home and risks coming from abroad - on our dashboard. 'The growing momentum in the [housing] market is now in my view the brightest light on that dashboard.’ Sir Jon said it is the strength of the housing market, rather than the weather, which is actually ‘the dominant topic of conversation in the UK.’ Official figures, from the Office for National Statistics, show the average home in London ‘earned’ more than its owner over the last year after prices rose by nearly 18 per cent. A typical worker in the capital with a full-time job earns a salary of £35,250 before tax, but their home, also in the capital, ‘earned’ a tax-free £63,000 over the same 12 month period.","In last three months average estate agent sold 23 houses, a six-year high .

"By . Matt Chorley . and Mark Duell . and Lucy Osborne . The government tonight insisted it is getting tough on welfare handouts amid growing public anger about Benefits Street star White Dee's holiday in the sun. Mother-of-two Dee - whose real name is Deirdre Kelly and is said to receive up to £10,000-a-year in handouts - last night denied downing £500 bottles of champagne on holiday - insisting she ‘f****** hated the stuff’. The Department for Work and Pensions refused to comment on her case directly, but mounted a fresh defence of its plans to to ensure anyone who is capable of work finds a job. Scroll down for video . White Dee is facing a probe into her disability benefits after being pictured cavorting with friends on holiday in Magaluf - while claiming to be too depressed to work . The reality TV star from the Channel 4 . programme had been reportedly seen drinking Moet during a bar crawl in . Magaluf, where she also hosted a pool party that featured a wet T-shirt . contest. The trip sparked criticism because Dee, who receives Employment and Support Allowance, . has always claimed she could not work because she suffered from . depression. Ministers insisted it would never commented on individual cases. But Downing . Street and the Department for Work and Pensions used the opportunity to . highlight changes made to the benefits system since the coalition was . formed in 2010. David . Cameron's official spokesman said: 'I would point you to all of the . things the government is doing in terms of toughening up the regime.' Employment . and Support Allowance is replacing Incapacity Benefit, with claimants . regularly reassessed to see if they are still eligible. A . DWP Spokesman said: 'We are reforming disability benefits by . introducing a new face-to-face assessment and regular reviews for . Disability Living Allowance - something missing under the old system. 'We . are also re-assessing people on incapacity benefits to see what work . they can do - with the right support - rather than just writing them off . on sickness benefits as happened in the past. 'Our welfare reforms will ensure that support goes to those who need it most.' Dee, who starred in the Channel 4 documentary about life on benefits, has been spotted drinking champagne in a luxury hotel in Magaluf this week . Officials also stressed that all complaints about any benefit claimant will be fully investigated. 'We are fixing the welfare system to stop errors and ensuring investigators have the resources to catch cheats,' the spokesman added. 'The public play a vital role in our efforts to crack down on benefit fraud and error. We urge anyone who suspects someone of cheating the system to report this to the benefit fraud hotline. 'If your circumstances have changed, make sure that you tell the authorities before any overpayments get out of hand or to make sure you are receiving your full entitlement.' There is no suggestion Dee has broken the rules, and her aides say she has been in touch with benefits officials about her claims since February. Since appearing on Benefits Street she has seen appeared on TV several times, and been linked with a string of new jobs including standing as an MP and becoming a TV chef. This week she took to Facebook to deny claims that she drank . champagne while on her holiday. Dee, 42, said: ‘I’m . turning into Jesus - making cloudy lemonade turn into booze. You gotta . love the press haha.’ And, responding to a supportive comment, she . added: ‘F****** hate the stuff hun haha.’ Her . agent Barry Tomes insisted she was not paid for going on the trip. It . was among a string of personal appearances she has made since finding . fame on Benefits Street, filmed in Birmingham. Mr Tomes told MailOnline yesterday: ‘Dee has been back in the UK since Saturday. Dee had lots of fun as the many pictures show. ‘She missed the children [and] she . hates flying, but she understands why we are trying to get her active to . help us decide the suitability for some projects we would like her to . undertake in the future. ‘She is not on Job Seekers’ Allowance . as reported - she is on [Employment and] Support Allowance. We have been . in touch with the benefits agency since we started to represent Dee in . February.’ The 42-year-old told the TV programme she has been left too depressed to work since her mother died . She was pictured sipping cocktails and lying on sun-loungers in the beach resort . It is not against the rules to go on holiday if you are in receipt of disability living allowance. But . claimants must inform the Department for Work and Pensions immediately . if their condition changes. The Disability Living Allowance is a minimum of £21 a week. In . the last financial year the UK's total bill on DLA was estimated at . £13.7billion, given to 3.3million adults - equivalent to the Department for Transport's budget. Those . claiming Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) - including Dee - can still claim . benefits for four weeks if going abroad, but claimers must speak to . their local Jobcentre before they leave. ESA . offers money to UK residents of working age if they are ill or disabled . and unable to work, with the basic amount at £71.70 a week. They . must pass a limited capability for work assessment, and not receive . Income Support, Jobseeker’s Allowance or Pension Credit. The DWP does not discuss individual circumstances, due to data protection laws - specifically the Data Protection Act 1998. This was passed in July 1998 and commenced in March 2000, under Tony Blair’s Labour government. It replaced the previous 1984 Act. But Dee’s trip sparked a row on . Twitter and Facebook. Chris Terry said: ‘White Dee obviously having . another string of “good days” - eventually she might even use these to . find a job.’ And . Shona Lou added: ‘So White Dee is too depressed to work? She didn’t . look depressed at the pool parties in Magaluf drinking champagne.’ But . others were more supportive, with Louise Dunn posting: ‘How ridiculous. What [do] they expect you to do? Curl up in a ball and not enjoy yourself?’ Natalie . Hart added: ‘Depression means you have to sit in a house and stare at . the telly all day obviously! How silly of us to think otherwise! You . have a good craic!’ Earlier . today, the Mail reported how Dee was facing a probe into her disability . benefits after being pictured cavorting with friends on holiday in . Magaluf – while claiming to be too depressed to work.

Mr Tomes also told the Mail how Dee was currently . considering an offer to front a new cookery show. ‘What many people don’t know about Dee is that she is an amazing cook and has been offered her own cookery show,’ he said. Mr Tomes said he has recommended that Dee takes holidays in the sun to . help her combat her depression so that she can get back into work. He . added that she has had seven offers from production companies in total, . including from BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, as well as three . separate record deals, but has had to turn them down because she is ‘too . unwell’. ‘It is like a . light switch goes off when you are with her, sometimes she’s fine but . then suddenly her whole mood will change and there’s nothing you can . do,’ he said of her condition. ‘She could easily earn half a million from one of these, but she doesn’t want to at the moment.’ It is now said the single mother-of-two will not face a quiz from benefits officials .

"By . Matt Chorley . and Richard Spillett . People who want to see Tony Blair jailed for the Iraq War have their ‘heart in the right place’, Boris Johnson said today. But the London Mayor warned it would be ‘very difficult’ to convict the former Prime Minister because he is ‘a very eel-like customer’. The senior Tory spoke out as it emerged the bill for the long-delayed report on the 2003 conflict is on course to hit £10million. Tony Blair, pictured answering questions in 2010, has been accused of trying to delay publication of the Chilcot Inquiry . There is growing pressure for the . Chilcot Inquiry to publish its report, almost five years since it was . announced by the last Labour government. David Cameron wants it to be released as soon as possible, with Mr Blair denying he is responsible for the hold-up. Today . Mr Johnson said that he had come to view the entire case for the move . to topple Saddam Hussein as ‘nonsense’ and had sympathy for those who . want Mr Blair to face the law. Taking . calls on LBC 97.3, he said: ‘I’d like to see the report published. There will be plenty of arguments you can make about bringing all kinds . of people to justice. London Mayor Boris Johnson said it would be difficult to convict Mr Blair for war crimes . ‘I . happen to think that in the case of Tony Blair, it will be quite . difficult to secure a conviction. He is a very eel like customer. [Laughter]. I think it would be very unlikely that you’d get him.’ He . later added: ‘I mean, you can have some very nice eels. I don’t want to . be rude to the former Prime Minister, you can have some; I felt guilty . as soon as I said that. ‘He . can be, you know, he’s a very, very adept and agile lawyer and I think . that … our caller who thought that he was going to be imprisoned for . what he did in Iraq, his heart is in the right place.’ Mr . Johnson added: ‘I just think there will undoubtedly be people who . continue to try to bring Tony Blair to justice in one way or another. I . think it unlikely that they will succeed in that respect.’ Sir . John Chilcot’s investigation into the 2003 conflict last took evidence . from a witness three years ago but the report has yet to be published. It . was claimed today that a row over the publication of conversations . between former Prime Minister Tony Blair and ex US president George W . Bush is behind the delay. The Daily Mirror reported that the row over publication of the pair's letters and meetings could mean the cost to the . taxpayer rises to around £10million. Whitehall sources say the process of declassifying . documents, including Mr Blair’s correspondence with the then President, remains stalled. It . is thought that no one involved has so far received a letter from the . inquiry as part of the so-called  ‘Maxwellisation’ process – the legal . requirement to notify individuals who are criticised in a . government-commissioned report. Whitehall sources . have also suggested that with an election due in May 2015, it will be . deemed too politically difficult to publish it until after voters have . gone to the polls. One of the main bones of contention over the report into the conflict (pictured) is private notes between Blair and the then US President George W. Bush . One . source has said: ‘It’s certainly not going to be ready before the end of . the year and it would be a highly political act to publish in the months . before an election. The can is going to be kicked further down the . road.’ Labour . strategists are said to be alarmed at the prospect of voters being . reminded of the Iraq war in the months before the election, since the . conflict was blamed for driving many of its voters to the Liberal . Democrats in 2005 and 2010. The delays and the spiraling bill has added to the anger felt by families of soldiers killed in the conflict, it claims. Rose . Gentle, from the Military Families Support Group told the Daily Mirror that . members of her organisation feel Mr Blair is 'laughing at them'. It is said the delays to the report by Sir John Chilcot (right) have been caused by a row over letters between George W. Bush (left) and Tony Blair . Current Prime Minister David Cameron waded into the row this week when he called for the report to be made public as quickly as possible . A . No 10 aide said: ‘The PM believes there is no excuse for any . further lengthy delay in publishing Chilcot. It would be unreasonable to . postpone it beyond the next election.’ A Cabinet Office spokesperson said last night: 'The Chilcot Inquiry has had full unfettered access to all government papers. 'The . Cabinet Office has been in a constructive dialogue with the Inquiry . team over recent months, with a clear view to meeting their . declassification requests. 'This . has involved several thousand documents, subject only to ensuring that . national security and foreign policy objectives are not compromised as . provided for in the protocol agreed at the outset of the Inquiry. That . process should be concluded shortly.'","London Mayor says he now views the case for 2003 conflict as 'nonsense'

"By . Matt Chorley . and Gerri Peev . Ukip's attempts to purge the party of members with controversial views have sugffered a fresh setback after it emerged two council candidates have questioned whether Mor Farah is British and called for Islam to be banned. Nigel Farage has spent the week insisting his party is not racist, and yesterday suspended two members for links to far-right groups. But fresh comments have emerged from candidates in local elections on May 22 which cause further embarrassment to the party. Scroll down for video . David Wycherley, a Ukip council candidate for Walsall, caused controversy with remarks about Mo Farah . Mr Wycherley questioned why Farah , who was born in Somalia, was competing for Britain at the London Olympics . Mr Wycherley also posted comments about 'starving Africans' on his Facebook page . A UKIP council candidate queried whether Mo Farah was qualified to race for Team GB when he was an ‘African from Somalia’. The jibe - made by David Wycherley, a Ukip council candidate for Walsall - came just hours after the runner seized the gold medal for the 10,000 metres at the 2012 London Games . The athlete, who grew up in London after fleeing his war-torn country - became a double Olympic champion for Team GB. But Mr Wycherley queried whether he could be British, asking his Facebook friends to explain ‘how Mo Farah, an African from Somalia who trains in America, has won a Gold medal for Great Britain’. In another Facebook post, Mr Wycherley, who is standing for the Rushall-Shelfield ward, joked about ‘starving Africans’ while complaining about his water bill. Somali-born Mo Farah won gold in the 5,000m and 10,000m at the London 2012 Olympic Games . Nigel Farage today threw away the . chance to become an MP within weeks as he ruled himself out of standing . in a crunch by-election. The . Ukip leader said he would not be the party's candidate in the Tory seat . of Newark vacated by shamed MP Patrick Mercer who resigned last night . in a sleaze scandal . Last . night Mr Farage said David Cameron would have to resign as Prime . Minister if he won the seat for Ukip, but today he confirmed he would . not be on the ballot paper. But in a statement outside a pub in Bath this morning, Mr Farage claimed he had not had long to consider whether or not to run. 'I have no doubt that UKIP will throw the . kitchen sink at this Newark by-election, but it won’t be me doing it . and we won’t get that huge distraction,' he told BBC Breakfast. Tory defence minister Anna Soubry said on Twitter: 'Niger Farage is not stupid - he knows he'd lose and runs frit from Newark!' It also emerged last night that Jackie Garnett, a Ukip candidate for the Royston South Ward in Oldham, suggested that the UK should ‘ban Islam and knock down all the mosques’ in a Facebook post. A UKIP spokesman said that the party would investigate their posts, adding: ‘Ukip is a non-racist, non-sectarian party and all candidates and members are expected to uphold these values. 'Where evidence is produced about individuals, it will be considered at the earliest opportunity by the national executive committee as part of an established disciplinary procedure.’ The row came just as another candidate, William Henwood who suggested comedian Lenny Henry should emigrate to a ‘black country’, quit his party membership. Mr Henry had said there should be more people from ethnic minority backgrounds in the creative industries. In response, Mr Henwood had told the BBC: ‘If black people come to this country and don’t like mixing with white people why are they here? If he (Henry) wants a lot of blacks around go and live in a black country.’ Ukip said that Mr Henwood’s remarks about Mr Henry ‘caused enormous offence and UKIP MEP candidate for the West Midlands Bill Etheridge spoke for many in the party with his strong condemnation’. Ukip also suspended two unnamed members after it emerged that one had been a BNP member from 2005 until 2010 and another had given money to the English Defence League (EDL). A Ukip source insisted that the men had a right to appeal which is why their identities were being kept secret. He . added that their links to the other parties had been uncovered by . vetting procedures, adding: ‘We will be redoubling our efforts. It’s a . tiny minority and we have to keep working hard to make sure the whole . party’s reputation is not contaminated.’ Nigel Farage has banned anyone from . taking up Ukip membership if they have links to the two extremist . parties. The Ukip leader last night revealed he suspected that his party . had been infiltrated and that ‘one or two people have joined Ukip with . the intention of perhaps not doing it any good’. ‘I’m investigating that, looking at that as we speak,’ he told the BBC. He has previously resisted sacking MEPs and councillors over controversial remarks. Jackie Garnett, a Ukip candidate for the Royston South Ward in Oldham, suggested that the UK should ¿ban Islam and knock down all the mosques¿ in a Facebook post . Roger Helmer, a UKIP MEP, yesterday was forced on the defensive after saying people had as much right to dislike homosexuality as they did certain types of tea. The politician, who has previously suggested people could have their sexuality ‘turned’ by psychiatrists, was asked by the Sun newspaper whether he stood by remarks that he found same sex relationships ‘distasteful if not viscerally repugnant’. He said: ‘Different people have different tastes. You may tell me you don’t like Earl Grey tea. That may be a minority view but you are entitled not to like it if you don’t like it.’","Ukip candidate David Wycherley made jibe about Somali-born Farah .

"By . Matt Chorley . and Daily Mail Reporter . When the days get shorter and the weather colder, many of us no doubt envy those who have headed for a new life in the sun. However, making such a move can actually leave us more miserable, according to research. A study of those who moved to a Mediterranean country found their levels of happiness were lower than those who had headed in the opposite direction. And official figures from Spanish authorities show how 90,000 Brits packed up and left last year, fleeing the eurozone crisis, high unemployment and a crash in house prices. Big changes: This couple may look happy, but scientists have found that those who move to the Mediterranean can end up more miserable than if they had stayed at home. Tom Utley agrees . Data from the National Institute of Statistics reveals how almost a quarter of Britons registered with local councils in Spain went home last year. In all, 87,880 left Spain behind after a life in sun failed to live up to the dream. In a separate study, University of Leicester researchers . looked at 256 migrants from Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Netherlands, . France, and 73 from the UK, who relocated to Spain, Portugal, Greece and . Cyprus in search of a new life. The migrants were asked how happy they . were on a scale of one to 10 compared with 56,000 people who stayed in . the northern countries. It was revealed that the migrants were less happy, scoring 7.3 out of ten, compared with the average of 7.5. And the gap was even higher for Brits with migrants four per cent less happy than those back in Blighty. Dr David Bartram analysed the data to take account of differences between migrants and those who stayed in terms of age, health, income, education, employment and religious beliefs, to make sure these factors did not distort the results. Report: On average migrants were found to have higher incomes than the average in their new country . He said: 'The key finding from the analysis is that people from northern Europe who migrated to southern Europe are less happy than the stayers in northern Europe.' On average the migrants were found to have higher incomes than the average in their new country, due to higher education levels. Many previous studies suggest that these factors would result in a higher social status and levels of happiness. However the paper, which will be presented at the British Sociological Association's annual conference in Leeds on Wednesday revealed that migration can disrupt social ties and make people less happy. The gap was even higher for Brits, with migrants four per cent less happy than those back in Blighty . 'Migration itself can be disruptive to other dimensions of people's lives- social ties, sense of belonging- possibly with consequences for their happiness,' said Dr Bartram. 'Perhaps any positive subjective consequences were outweighed by negative consequences arising from the more general disruptive effects of international migration on one's life. 'Within the European Union opportunities for such migration are abundant, and migration flows in this mode have reached significant dimensions. 'The analysis in this paper, however, raises doubts about whether migration in this mode will result in greater happiness for the migrants.'","Researchers from the University of Leicester looked at 256 migrants .

"By . Jason Groves . and Matt Chorley . He was making a speech about  the rights of working fathers to see their families. So who better for Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to call on for support than his wife Miriam. Spanish-born Mrs Clegg appeared to hijack her husband’s press conference with a colourful intervention, suggesting that men who treat women as equals have ‘more cojones’ than those who don’t. For those whose Spanish is a little rusty, cojones means b***s. Ms cojones: Clegg was told men who treat women as equals have more 'b***s'... by his own wife Miriam . It seemed to be a spontaneous interjection, but aides admitted it had been planned to generate publicity about an issue the couple believe needs debating. ‘It was just a slightly different way of making an important point,’ an aide said. Mrs Clegg also hit out at ‘dinosaurs’ who believe childcare should be left to women and asked her husband to send out a message that caring for children ‘does not affect your level of testosterone’. Mr Clegg feigned surprise at her intervention, joking to the audience: ‘Gosh, Miriam has put up her hand. I’m terrified about what is about to come . . .’ He began his answer: ‘Of course, I agree with you . . .’ Speaking yesterday at the launch of Cityfathers, an organisation for working fathers in the City of London, Mr Clegg said it was time bosses stopped ‘raising an eyebrow’ when men asked for time off work to care for their children. It was a highly unusual intervention from the Deputy PM's wife, who is normally very careful not to comment on politics . He said fathers should not be made to see themselves as breadwinners rather than carers. Mrs Clegg, a lawyer who earns four times as much as her husband, then put her hand up and said: ‘This is the moment of truth. You have spoken a lot about measures, which is all well and good. But an awful lot is about attitudes. ‘There are many, many dinosaurs, not here but out there, that still think that a man who takes care of his own children, he is some kind of less of a man. 'So if you and other modern working fathers could start saying not only loudly, but also proudly, that taking care of your own children and being responsible for those children does not affect your level of testosterone – and that men who actually treat women as equals are the ones with more cojones.’ Mr Clegg joked that he would not be translating ‘cojones’ for the audience. He said he ‘massively agreed’ with his wife, adding: ‘The idea that it is not manly to care is as absurd as saying that it is not womanly to work.’ Nick Clegg’s salary is vastly outstripped by his wife. Mr Clegg earns £134,565 a year as an MP and Deputy Prime Minister, while Miriam Clegg – a Spanish-born lawyer for international legal firm Dechert – earns £500,000. Three sons: Mr Clegg and his wife Miriam, who brings in a £500,000 salary from her legal work . The Cleggs live in a £1.6million townhouse in Putney, South-West London. They married in 2000 and have three sons – Antonio, Alberto and Miguel. Mrs Clegg has said previously that the pair split the childcare and her husband often tried to do the school run. She admitted they had a ‘fantastic nanny’ to help look after the children.","Lib Dem leader took a question from his wife at event on parenting .

"By . Matt Chorley . and Darren Boyle . and Julian Robinson . London Mayor Boris Johnson has condemned a European Court of Justice ruling against a British application to block the so-called 'Robin Hood Tax' European judges have rejected a bid by Britain to block a financial transaction tax on the City which could cost Britain £25billion-a-year. Boris Johnson condemned the 'barmy' plan, which he warned would lead the UK at the mercy of interference from Brussels. The European Court of Justice ruled against a British application to block the tax, claiming it was premature when the detail of the plan has not been agreed at EU level. The British government has not signed up to the controversial tax, which it is feared, could lead to levies on transactions capable of severely affecting deals made in the City of London. A study from the Right-wing think tank the Adam Smith Institute last year estimated the total cost to the UK economy alone could be as high as £25.5billion a year. Mr Johnson condemned the ruling to throw of the UK legal challenge, claiming rival . financial centres would now be 'licking their lips' at the prospect of . picking up trade from Britain. The London Mayor said: 'This judgment beggars belief. With London’s economy . buoyant once more and driving the national recovery, the last thing that . we need is a barmy tax that will stamp on growth and potentially drive . businesses to financial centres outside the EU. 'Finance is a global . game and our rivals in the US and Asia will be licking their lips in . sheer delight. 'This ruling also raises serious questions about how the . UK can safeguard its financial services sector, given that we are not in . the euro. 'The Government has been right to oppose this all along . and I am sure they will continue to fight this nonsense still further. 'We cannot allow jobs, growth and livelihoods to be jeopardised by those . in the EU who mistakenly view financial services as an easy target, . despite the fact that the industry is crucial to the economic recovery . of all its members.' Concerns have been raised that British financial . institutions engaging in transactions with those in the participating . EU member states would be liable to pay the FTT, which would then have . to be collected by the UK tax authorities. The Government challenged a . decision allowing 'enhanced co-operation' between the 11 countries, . including France and Germany, in favour of setting up the FTT. The European Court of Justice ruling has sparked fears trade could be lost to other financial centres around the world . But . the ECJ ruled that 'the contested decision does no more than authorise . the establishment of enhanced co-operation, but does not contain any . substantive element on the FTT itself' and 'the elements of a future FTT . challenged by the United Kingdom are in no way constituent elements of . the contested decision'. The Treasury said the ECJ decision allowed . the Government to mount a fresh challenge when the final proposals for . an FTT are produced. Ukip leader Nigel Farage branded the Financial Transaction Tax a 'deliberate assault on the City of London' A spokesman said: 'The Government is determined to continue . to ensure that the interests of countries outside of the single . currency but inside the single market are properly protected as the euro . area continues to integrate, including with any proposal for a . Financial Transactions Tax.' Ukip leader Nigel Farage claimed the FTT . was a 'deliberate assault on the City of London' adding: 'This FTT judgment shows that the UK cannot act to . protect the UK’s biggest interest. It is impotent and at the mercy of an . antagonistic federalist court - the ECJ. 'It shows Cameron’s . argument that the UK Government can negotiate a better deal for British . business from within the EU as a fraud and a farce. 'The only way to . protect the UK financial interest is to withdraw from the tax-hungry EU . and stop giving Brussels power over us.' The Institute of Directors' senior adviser on Europe, Allie Renison, said: 'Two of the last four legal challenges brought by the UK against EU rules on financial services have now been thrown out. 'While there is still some hope for a future challenge when the FTT is put into place, there is a real risk that the financial industry's support for EU membership may be eroded as a result.' But TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady . said: 'The Chancellor should never have taken this case and used . taxpayers’ money to defend City fat cats. 'It’s time the financial sector . paid its fair share of the costs of the economic crisis they helped . cause.'","European Court of Justice throws out British bid to block 'Robin Hood tax'

"By . Jack Doyle . and Matt Chorley . Britain is becoming too reliant on cheap foreign workers, Yvette Cooper has warned. In a major speech, Labour's shadow home secretary insisted some immigration is 'bad' and some is 'good', as she attacked the government for failing to do enough to protect the wages of Brits. But she admitted the last Labour government had been wrong to open the doors to eastern Europeans, and failed to address 'the worries people had'. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper will call for minimum custodial terms for sweatshop owners and gangmasters who base their businesses on employing illegal migrants . Ms Cooper warned employers who engage in the . ‘wholesale’ exploitation of illegal immigrant workers would face . automatic jail terms. She called for minimum custodial terms for . sweatshop owners and gangmasters who base their businesses on employing . illegal migrants. She also admitted Labour let too many . immigrants in by abandoning controls on Eastern Europeans in 2004. And in a sign the party is hardening its policy on migration, she rejected ‘laissez faire’ attitudes to migrants which ‘treats all immigration as good, and ignores the unfair impact and consequences of different kinds of immigration.’ She said: 'We do not want to live in a society dependent on the exploitation of cheap migrant labour – it’s immoral, it increases low skilled immigration, increases unfairness and resentment.' She also pledged to stop employers ‘exploiting cheap migrant labour to undercut local jobs and wages.’ Existing laws mean criminals can face an unlimited fine or jail of up to two years if found guilty of the large scale employment of illegal immigrants. But in many cases gangmasters escape with just a slap on the wrist. Labour would change the law to ensure a minimum custodial sentence for the ‘wholesale’ employment of illegal migrants. Ms Cooper added: ‘Labour’s approach has changed. As we’ve said, the last Labour government got things wrong on immigration. ‘We should have had transitional controls in place for Eastern Europe.’ ‘The figures were wrong, and migration was far greater than we expected.’ ‘As a result the pace and scale of immigration was too great and it is right to bring it down.’ ‘And we should have recognised more quickly the impact on low skilled jobs, and the worries people had.’ Prime Minster David Cameron has pledged to reduce net migration to the ¿tens of thousands¿ by the election . She said the Government’s approach ‘isn’t working’ and point to the recent rise in net migration by 60,000 to 210,000. David Cameron has pledged to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ by the election. In one recent case a Wiltshire-based recruitment consultant who systematically exploited 60 Filipino dairy workers was given a suspended jail sentence.

"By . James Chapman . and Matt Chorley . Former Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd led a chorus of calls for Maria Miller to quit ‘as a matter of honour’ last night. Her comments came as even close allies of David Cameron said the Culture Secretary should offer to leave the Cabinet following the row over her expenses. Baroness Boothroyd, a widely respected figure across all parties, said the Prime Minister had made ‘an error of judgment’ by allowing Mrs Miller to remain. Scroll down for video . Culture Secretary Maria Miller seen leaving Number 10 after the first Cabinet meeting since her expenses apology . Former Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd tonight called for Maris Miller to be sacked from the Cabinet, . In an interview with BBC Radio 4 she said she was 'surprised' the Culture Secretary did not quit at the weekend. She added: 'My concern is that Parliament has taken hard knocks for a long time... and this does not help at all. 'It . is a matter of honour. People in the past, leading members of . government, leading Members of Parliament have resigned, and I think it . is for Mrs Miller to have done likewise. 'And . I’m sad to say that I regard it as an error of judgement on the part of . the Prime Minister that he didn’t quietly say to her: ""I think it’s . time to go – thank you for your services, but I think it’s time to go"".' The embattled Culture Secretary . launched a concerted attempt to cling to her job, sending her chief . Parliamentary aide Mary Macleod on to the airwaves to condemn continued . media coverage as ‘unnecessary and unacceptable’. But . Mrs Macleod only poured fuel on the flames by claiming the minister was . the victim of a ‘witch hunt’ because of her involvement in the Leveson . reforms of Press regulation and legislating for gay marriage. The . Culture Secretary used a column in her local newspaper, the Basingstoke . Gazette, to broaden her widely criticised 32-second apology in the . Commons last week after being ordered to repay £5,800 in overclaimed . mortgage costs. ‘I am devastated that this has happened, and that I have let you down,’ she told constituents. But . last night, Mrs Miller’s appeal appeared to be falling on deaf ears, as . the Basingstoke Gazette’s website was overwhelmed with almost . universally negative comments from readers. Mr . Cameron appeared determined to stand by Mrs Miller, despite a growing . number of Tory MPs insisting publicly that she should go ahead of a . meeting of the Parliamentary party today. Downing . Street again pointed out  she had been cleared of the central . allegation against her – that she set out to cheat taxpayers to fund a . property lived in by her parents. But . ominously for Mrs Miller, who was found to have overclaimed for . mortgage costs and condemned for her attitude to a sleaze inquiry, even . some senior allies of the Prime Minister now believe she should quit due . to the damage being done to her party. Mrs Miller's parliamentary aide, Tory MP Mary Macleod (right) sent this text to fellow Tory MPs pleading for support and blaming Fleet Street opposition to press regulation for the 'witch-hunt' Culture Secretary Maria Miller arrived in Downing Street for this morning's Cabinet meeting and went straight from her car into Number 10 without turning to photographers . Ex-Speaker Betty Boothroyd: . 'I think it is a matter of honour - a question of honour, quite . honestly. I regard it as an error of judgement on the part of the Prime . Minister that he didn’t quietly say to her: ""I think it’s time to go.""' A Conservative MP: 'I think Maria has probably had it, I'm afraid. I think she is toast.' Tory minister Esther McVey: 'I can honestly say it wouldn't be how I would have made an apology' Tory MP Zac Goldsmith: 'It would be the Prime Minister's decision who he surrounds himself with. I am surprised that Maria Miller hasn't stepped down . Tory MP Jackie Doyle-Price: 'If I was in . that position facing a difficult set of local elections, I wouldn’t be . expecting my colleagues to defend me.' Tory MP Matthew Offord: 'Knocking on doors in my constituency this weekend people did raise the . expenses issue with me and they believe that nothing has changed.' Tory MP Nicola Blackwood:  'I have to say if I . was faced with the kind of questions that she is faced with, I would be . really quite worried indeed.' One . said privately: ‘If she had a shred of self-awareness, she would have . offered to go. It might not be fair, but life is not fair.’ Baroness Boothroyd said: ‘I’m very disagreeably surprised Mrs Miller did not resign at the weekend when all this blew up. ‘This . was the time that I think she should have gone to the Prime Minister . and said that she thought she ought to relinquish her Cabinet position, . and I think the Prime Minister should have been gracious enough to . accept that.’ The former . Speaker added: ‘I think it is a matter of honour – a question of honour . ... All my life I’ve wanted to protect our Parliamentary system, which I . cherish, and I think that Mrs Miller is bringing it into disrepute.’ Parliamentary . private secretary Mrs Macleod insisted sections of the media had . ulterior motives in calling for Mrs Miller to resign. She said: ‘There are journalists outside Maria’s house, I think, harassing her children and her parents.’ Bizarrely, a source close to Mrs Miller later tried to disown her aide’s remarks, saying: ‘Maria has never expressed that view.’ Despite . the fightback, a significant number of Tory MPs believe Mrs Miller must . go. There is particular concern in marginal seats, where a few votes . could cost the party dear. A survey suggested a quarter of Conservatives representing such constituencies believe the Culture Secretary should quit. Richmond MP Zac Goldsmith said he was ‘surprised’ Mrs Miller had not stepped down from the Cabinet. Nicola Blackwood said if she was in Mrs Miller's position she 'would be really quite worried indeed'; Zac Goldsmith said he was 'surprised' Mrs Miller was still in her job; Jackie Doyle-Price said Mrs Miller could not expect her colleagues to defend her . 1996: Bought double-fronted Victorian terrace house in Wimbledon, south-west London, for £234,000 . 2005: Elected Tory MP for Basingstoke . 2005-2009: Claimed £90,718 in expenses on the property . 2007: Increased the mortgage for a second time to £575,000, with taxpayers meeting the cost . 2009 April: Stopped claiming expenses . 2009 May: Commons officials wrote to MPs demanding they sign a declaration agreeing to pay capital gains tax on second homes . 2010: Became minister for Disabled People . 2011: Started claiming expenses on renting a property in her Basingstoke constituency .

December 2012: Labour MP John Mann made a complaint about claiming expenses because her elderly parents lived in the house . 2014: Sold London home for £1.47million, a profit of £1.236million . April: Is cleared on claiming expenses for home where parents lived. But standards commissioner said she overclaimed for mortgage bills by £45,000. Standards committee of MPs interprets rules differently and said £5,800 was owed . He . said the allegations against her demonstrated the need for a system of . ‘recall’, where voters can trigger a by-election if an MP has been found . to have broken the members’ code of conduct. ‘In . a mature and functioning democracy, her constituents should be able to . hold her to account at all times, and not just at the election,’ Mr . Goldsmith added. Shipley MP . Philip Davies said: ‘Obviously the whole thing is extremely damaging for . the Conservative Party, it’s damaging for Parliament as a whole and . politicians. The sooner the matter is resolved the better.’ Jackie . Doyle-Price, who is defending Thurrock, the most marginal Conservative . constituency in the country, said: ‘I’ll just make this point: faced . with a difficult set of elections, I would not be expecting colleagues . to defend me.’ Grassroots . party members called for Mrs Miller to resign. Brian Leversha, Chairman . of the Aldershot and North Hampshire Conservative Association, said: ‘I . think anybody that has that sort of thing hanging over them should make . their own decision to stand aside. ‘She has upset a lot of people by what she has done and I think Cameron has misjudged it by standing by her.’ However, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said Mrs Miller should ‘absolutely not’ resign. She . added: ‘I think this issue has been ruled on, I think we should move on . I think Maria Miller is an excellent Secretary of State and she should . be left to get on with her job. 'There’s been a ruling by the appropriate authorities, it has been complied with.’ Employment minister Esther McVey (left) said she would not have made such a short apology to the Commons . Boris Johnson, visiting Imperial College London today, said only that Mrs Miller was being 'hounded' before adding: 'How about that?'

"By . Alan Roden . and Daniel Martin . David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have signed a joint declaration that promises more financial powers for Scotland if it rejects independence. The move by the leaders of the three main parties is an attempt to rubbish claims by Alex Salmond that Westminster will not deliver more devolution if Scots vote ‘no’. It comes ahead of tonight's TV debate between Scottish First Minister Mr Salmond and Alistair Darling, the former Labour Chancellor who fronts the pro-union Better Together campaign. The three leaders of the main parties - David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband - pictured yesterday at a service to commemorate 100 years since the outbreak of World War One, have signed a joint declaration of more financial powers for Scotland if they reject independence . There are just over six weeks to go until voters in Scotland decide whether to remain in the UK or become an independent nation in the September 18 referendum. Polls have so far failed to show a majority in favour of independence, but both campaigns are hoping to receive a boost as a result of tonight’s TV debate. The six leaders’ declaration states: ‘We support a strong Scottish Parliament in a strong United Kingdom. ‘We now pledge to strengthen further the powers of the Scottish Parliament, in particular in the areas of fiscal responsibility and social security.’ Currently, control over council tax and business rates means the Scottish Government raises about 15 per cent of its £30billion budget, with the majority of public spending funded by a block grant from the UK Treasury. The LibDems have the most radical vision for further devolution, proposing to hand over full control of inheritance tax, capital gains tax, income tax and a good share of corporation tax. Holyrood, the  Scottish Parliament, would then control 60 per cent of  its revenue. The declaration came as Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, left, prepared for a TV debate with Alistair Darling, right, who fronts the pro-union Better Together campaign . Labour has proposed increasing the figure to 40 per cent, although experts dispute their calculations. They want members of the Scottish Parliament to have control of a 15p share of the basic 20p rate of income tax, and be able to increase higher bands – but not lower them unless all levels are reduced. Tory proposals would allow full control over all rates of income tax, with the block grant from Westminster reduced accordingly. VAT levels must remain the same under EU rules, but a share of the revenue from Scotland would be controlled  by Holyrood. Scottish MPs would also be allowed to ‘supplement’ welfare benefits, while housing benefit could be devolved. If around half of the VAT revenue from Scotland was allocated to Holyrood, the parliament would be responsible for more than 50 per cent of its budget. Blair McDougall, campaign director for the Better Together campaign, said: ‘Voters in Scotland have been listening to the independence debate for over two years now. Currently, control over council tax and business rates means the Scottish Government raises about 15 per cent of its £30billion budget . ‘Surely if Alex Salmond had convincing answers on the details of separation, we would have heard them by now.’ He added: ‘The referendum debate isn’t confined to TV studios. It is taking place in conversations between friends and family across Scotland. ‘The biggest debate is taking place on the doorsteps, around kitchen tables and in workplaces across the country. ‘And the more people talk about what leaving the UK would mean for our schools and hospitals, the more they are saying no thanks to separation.’ Yes Scotland chief executive Blair Jenkins said: ‘Independence is the opportunity of a lifetime for the people  of Scotland. 'We know Scotland is one of the richest countries in the world, wealthier than the UK, France and Japan, and only the powers offered by a ‘yes’ vote will enable us to make this wealth work better for everyone in Scotland.’","Joint declaration promises more financial powers if  independence is blocked .

"By . James Chapman . and Matt Chorley . and Damien Gayle . Nigel Farage was accused of hypocrisy yesterday over Ukip’s ‘racist’ EU immigration campaign posters because he employs his German wife as his secretary. But as senior figures from the three main parties attacked his party’s latest publicity drive, the Ukip leader insisted that no British person could do the taxpayer-funded job taken by his second wife, Kirsten. The anti-EU party is using a £1.5million donation from a multi-millionaire businessman to launch a poster campaign for next month’s European elections focused on immigration from the Continent. Scroll down for video . 'So, whose job is Kirsten taking?' Ukip leader Nigel Farage is asked by the BBC's Nick Robinson whether his German wife is taking a British worker's job, in light of the eurosceptic party's latest ad campaign . Secretary: Kirsten Farage, pictured last year, works for her husband in an EU-funded role . The most controversial billboard . carries a warning that 26million are unemployed across Europe, and asks: . ‘Whose job are they after?’ with a large hand pointing at the observer. Ukip’s opponents have likened the posters to those used in the past by the far-Right British National Party. Mr . Farage yesterday dismissed the criticism as ‘nonsense’, but ran into . trouble when he was confronted by the BBC’s Nick Robinson over his . employment of his publicity-shy German wife as his secretary using EU . allowances. ‘She came here as a highly skilled person earning a high salary paying a very large amount of tax,’ the Ukip leader insisted. ‘I . don’t think anybody else would want to be in my house at midnight going . through emails and getting me briefed for the next day. ‘It’s . a very different situation to a mass of hundreds of thousands of people . coming in and flooding the lower end of the labour market.’ Asked . whether a British person could take the position as his secretary, Mr . Farage said: ‘Nobody else could do that job, not unless they were . married to me.’ Mr Farage . said his wife earned a ‘very modest’ wage, of up to £30,000 a year, and . worked ‘extremely unsociable hours’ for ‘up to’ seven days a week. 'Nobody else could do that job': Mr Farage gave a stout defence of his wife's EU taxpayer-funded role . Mr Farage faced embarrassment yesterday after it emerged that a woman posing as a voter in Ukip’s manifesto actually works for him. Lizzy Vaid (right) appears in a full-page photograph as a voter from Devon, with a large quote stating: ‘I’ll be voting Ukip because they’re the only party listening to what people want.’ But Miss Vaid, who is half Indian, works in London and on her Twitter account she describes herself as ‘Ukip Events Manager and Assistant to Nigel Farage, as well as a lover of social occasions’. He pointed out that one in four MPs at Westminster and more than 70 other British Euro MPs also employ a close family member. Tory . former defence minister Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston . Churchill, became the first senior member of his party to attack the . poster campaign, funded by internet and property tycoon Paul Sykes. His . intervention was seen as significant because he chairs a cross-party . group on migration which is often critical of government policy. ‘At . a time when our country really needs to come together, the Ukip . advertising campaign is deeply divisive, offensive and ignorant,’ Mr . Soames said. Labour MP Mike . Gapes, former chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, had . already said that he hoped the ‘racist posters encourage all decent . British Commonwealth and EU citizens’ to vote for another party in the . European elections on May 22. Speech: Ukip leader Nigel Farage launches his party's European election bilboard campaign in Sheffield . Polish workers who arrived in Britain to pick fruit have graduated to better jobs and now feel fully ‘at home’ here – with some even joining Ukip, the country’s ambassador revealed yesterday. Witold Sobkow (right) said that, initially, his countrymen and women were doing low-skilled jobs when they moved to Britain after Poland joined the EU in 2004. But they have now learned English, obtained qualifications in UK schools and colleges and won ‘promotion’ to better jobs. Some had become involved in British politics. In an interview with the Independent, Poland’s ambassador to London said: ‘There are some relatively young people from Poland who are members of Ukip and they have this group, Friends of Poland in Ukip.’ But he insisted he was not condemning those planning to vote for Ukip in the European elections but the party’s poster campaign. ‘I . stand by my view that this is a racist, xenophobic campaign designed to . win votes by whipping up animosity against foreigners living and . working and contributing to this country,’ he said. Liberal Democrat president Tim Farron said the posters were ‘wrong not just factually but morally’. Former . Labour activist Dan Hodges said Ukip was ‘worse’ than the BNP, which . was now ‘finished’ as a political force. ‘The BNP were racist, but at . least they had the courage to be open about their racism,’ he added. Ukip’s deputy leader, Paul Nuttall, said Labour MPs were trying to close down a debate over immigration ‘by shouting racist’. He . said: ‘The fact of the matter is that we’ve got wage compression in . this country, we’ve got uncontrolled borders. And the only way we’re . going to get control of our borders is by leaving this club [the EU].’ UKIP yesterday unveiled four posters for next month’s European elections, which immediately sparked allegations of ‘racism’ from the party’s opponents. Here, Home Affairs Editor JAMES SLACK investigates the claims made by the controversial posters. CLAIM: 75 per cent of our laws are now made in Brussels. REALITY: No simple answer. Ukip’s estimate is based on figures produced by ex-European Parliament president Hans-Gert Pottering. Viviane Reding, an EU Commissioner, recently put the figure closer to 70 per cent. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg claimed in a TV debate with Nigel Farage that it is only 7 per cent. The independent House of Commons Library says ‘it is possible to justify any measure between 15 and 50 per cent’. It depends on whether the figures include only primary legislation passed by the UK Parliament, or all laws and regulations influenced by, or related to, Brussels. CLAIM: The United Kingdom pays £55million a day to the European Union and its Eurocrats. REALITY: Technically accurate. The figure – the equivalent of £20billion a year – is roughly what the British Government paid to EU institutions in 2012. However, the UK does get around £8billion of this money back in the form of the rebate negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and other payments, such as subsidies to farmers. This still leaves the UK making a net contribution of around £12billion a year, or £33million a day. CLAIM: British workers are hit hard by EU policy that allows unlimited cheap labour. REALITY: Last month a Government report concluded that ‘there is evidence for some labour market displacement in recent years when the economy was in recession’, with the low-skilled most likely to lose out. The Migration Advisory Committee found that for every 100 extra foreign-born working-age migrants in the UK, there was a reduction of 23 in the number of Britons in employment. Labour and the Tories have made similar comments to the Ukip poster in recent weeks. The poster carries a warning that 26 million unemployed people across Europe are 'after' UK jobs . CLAIM: 26million people in Europe are looking for work. REALITY: There were 25.622million people unemployed across the EU in February, according to EU figures. This includes the 2.2million unemployed people in Britain, most of whom are British citizens. Of course, not every jobseeker in Europe plans to move to the UK. But, as the eurozone continues to struggle, the UK has become an increasingly popular destination for workers from southern Europe. Last year, National Insurance numbers were issued to 51,000 Spaniards, 44,000 Italians and 30,000 Portuguese. Ministers have blamed the upturn in EU immigration to Britain for the increase in net migration, which currently stands at 212,000 a year. Married man: Nigel Farage has previously said that his wife Kirsten's 'brisk efficiency at first sight belied her ethereal appearance' Hamburg-born Kirsten Farage, née Mehr, keeps a very low profile and is rarely seen in public. At Ukip conferences, she sits anonymously in the audience. The Ukip leader has previously said of the moment he met Kirsten: ‘She was a stunning government bond broker whose brisk efficiency at first sight belied her ethereal appearance. 'She could have stepped into a pre-Raphaelite painting no questions asked.’ Kirsten, 49, gave up her career in the City, where she worked as an interpreter for a German bank, to look after the children - she and Mr Farage have two - and do her husband’s correspondence. She writes all his emails because he dislikes using computers. She is paid a salary by the European Parliament of more than £27,000 and has amassed more than £200,000 since she began working for him. She works from home and rarely visits Ukip’s HQ in London’s Mayfair, which she has described as a ‘freak show’.","Mr Farage met his German former government bond broker wife in 1996 .

"By . Luke Salkeld . and Matt Chorley . It is the exclusive seaside enclave where the well-known rub shoulders with the well-heeled. But the millionaire residents of Sandbanks are having their tranquil existence ruined by some unwelcome visitors. The area has become an unlikely magnet for raucous stag and hen groups. The exclusive Sandbanks area near Bournmeouth, Dorset is being plagued by hen and stag parties renting out houses on quiet residential streets . Multi-million pound properties in Sandbanks - the fourth most expensive area in the world - are being rented out to groups of up to 50 people for £1,000-a-night. The problem has also spread to neighbouring Canford Cliffs and Branksome Park. The groups are often bussed into the pubs and clubs of Bournemouth nearby, but return to the house parties in otherwise quiet residential streets late at night and cause havoc. Conservative MP Robert Syms said the growing trend was making large sums for the owners of the homes but make life a misery for people living nearby. Tory MP Robert Syms . In a debate in Parliament he read out a letter from a resident who claimed to have seen ‘prostitutes being delivered well into the night… loud bass music, taxis coming and going…’ Housemates have been seen playing football in gardens at 3am, throwing bottles over fences and climbing trees outside neighbouring properties, Mr Syms said. ‘We have to do something about this because it is making people’s lives a misery. People are fearful of a Friday afternoon. They pray for rain because people stay inside. ‘If you are a hen party you can rent a . naked butler which is a concern when they are serving drinks on a hot . afternoon in the garden.’ Burton Manor House in Poole sleeps 21 people in four bedrooms and is available to rent for up to £990-a-night . Ministers said councils and the police now have powers to close down party houses, like these in Poole, if they think will cause a disturbance . He said a father had returned home with his child to find ‘blow up dolls bought from a sex shop all the way around the veranda’. ‘Most of it is high spirits. Most of it is youngsters wanting to have some fun. In a residential area this is inappropriate. ‘This is a real problem for my constituents. This is ruining people’s lives. It is changing the nature of the area. Tory MP Robert Syms said he feared angry residents would take the law into their own hands . ‘I have heard stories of elderly people being barricaded into their homes because of the noise.’ One couple has bought a caravan which they go to stay in ‘to get a good night’s sleep’, Mr Syms added. ‘I fear that the anger of my constituents means they will take the law into their own hands. It is running people down and they are very angry indeed.’ The millionaires' playground of Sandbanks is only half a square mile of golden sand but is home to some of the most expensive properties in the country. A modest bungalow sold for £1.5million, but when it was demolished and the plot put back on the market with planning permission it went for £3million. QPR Harry Redknapp and ex-players Graeme Souness and Jamie Redknapp are among those who have bought homes there. Furious residents insist the problem of house parties is not confined to Bournemouth and has spread from other cities including Bath and Brighton. Jen Cameron told LBC radio: ‘People have responsible, stressful jobs and they want to use their home as a retreat. ‘It's not that we're offended by it, we all have celebrations, but if I can just give you some outline of the things that a lot of us are suffering: We've got screaming and shouting, kicking things over, emptying of hundreds of glass bottles into the recycling bin at goodness-knows-what-time, we've got drunk residents lighting barbecues against fences at 1.30 in the morning – and that might be a Tuesday. ‘We're having to get up for work. We're all working very hard like most of the country are at the moment. It's caused absolute misery for so many people. Resident Jen Cameron . ‘In fact, there is a previous resident who's been nearly suicidal with it. It's not that any of us object to hen and stag parties per se, but it's about inappropriate use of residential areas that are otherwise tranquil.’ Jen Cameron, 35, and husband Stephen, a 54 year old IT consultant, live next door to a large, modern detached house in Elmsted Road in Canford Cliffs. Mrs Cameron said: 'We have seen naked butlers serving drinks to groups of women in the garden as well as strippers for the male groups. 'You get blown up phallic-shaped toys tied to railings outside which obviously isn't appropriate for a residential area. 'I have seen people sat on the veranda using a funnel to pour vodka down their throats and we have had barbecues started at 1.30am.' Houses which can sleep up to 40 or 50 people are being rented out for more than £1,000-a-night, causing misery for people living nearby, Parliament was told . John Sprackling, the chairman of the Sandbanks and Branksome Park Residents Association, said: 'For the neighbours of these party houses the problem is very bad. People are moving out of their homes at weekends just to avoid the noise, either that or they have taken to bunkering down in their homes. 'The culmination was a house in Elmsted . Road in Canford Cliffs where Stella Artois bottles were thrown over a . hedge and smashed the patio doors of the woman next door. John Sprackling, residents association . 'The parties normally start at 3am when the groups have come back from the clubs in Bournemouth but by that time the council environmental health staff have gone home.' In the debate the Home Office minister Norman Baker said the problem was a ‘relatively new phenomenon’ which can affect communities ‘in quite profound ways’. ‘It is clear that the current system is fragmented, complex and inadequate.’ But under changes to anti-social behaviour laws councils and the police are to get new powers to close down properties if they have ‘reason to believe the use of a premises has caused a nuisance to the public, or could do’. Deluxe Holiday Homes is responsible for renting out several of the party houses. Michelle King, a spokeswoman for the company, said: 'We deeply regret any inconvenience that may have been caused to residents in the Canford Cliffs area. 'We have consistently sought to prevent this by only renting to mature groups. We welcome hearing about any problems.'","Large homes rented out to groups of up to 50 for more than £1,000-a-night .

"By . Laura Cox . Criticism: Thandie Newton claimed darker shades of make-up disappear more quickly . Thandie Newton has accused Boots of creating a racial divide through the ‘ghettoisation’ of make-up. The British film star, 41, said the high street chain initially stocks dark shades of foundation when a make-up range is launched, but then takes them off shelves much earlier than pale shades – forcing women with darker skin to shop in specialist stores. Speaking at a Selfridges event on Tuesday, Miss Newton, who is also the face of Olay, said: ‘If the make-up was in there longer, the girls would go and get it and then the stores would get more, and they’d realise that everybody wants it, and then they would stock it. ‘There’s this ghettoisation of make-up right now. The right shade is there for everybody but you can only get it at specialised shops. 'So you don’t go to Boots. So as a result we are all being physically separated when we go and buy make-up.' She added: ‘We’re starting to think they don’t . want us there. And it’s not that, it’s just that six-month time lapse . where the shops are waiting to be able to say it’s not selling so let’s . stop stocking it. We’ve got to encourage them.’ She . added: ‘I’ll go into Boots at Heathrow Airport if I’ve forgotten my . make-up bag or something and there isn’t even a picture of a black . woman. I hate that.’ Earlier this year Miss Newton revealed she suffered racist abuse growing up in Cornwall, but this is the first time the Crash star has openly attacked the beauty industry for creating a racial divide. Miss Newton is an award-winning actress who starred in Misson: Impossible II with Tom Cruise and alongside Will Smith in The Pursuit of Happyness. The star, who has daughters Ripley, . 14, Nico, 10, and three-month-old son Booker Jombe with her husband . director Ol Parker, described being treated like an outsider growing up . in Penzance. Make-up artist Kay Montano said: 'It all comes down to men in suits deciding what sells' (file photo) Miss Newton also recalled going to castings where she and James Bond actress Halle Berry were the only two auditioning for a role, because of the lack of black stars in Hollywood. Responding to the claims, make-up artist Kay Montano said: ‘Every single make-up company has every single shade. It’s all made. But it all comes down to territories and men in suits deciding what sells.’ A Boots spokesman said: ‘It is . disappointing when we hear our customers feel we can’t meet their beauty . needs, as many of the beauty brands available in store and on boots.com . offer a range of products for black skin.’","British film star, 41, said there is a 'ghettoisation of make-up right now'

"By . Martha Cliff . 'Selfie this, selfie that' we hear you say. It is probably the most overused word of 2014 but don't write it off just yet because the photographic phenomenon is doing really great things. First, women across the country wiped off their make-up for the #barefaceselfie and raised money for cancer and now a new craze is sweeping the net which sees people kicking off their shoes for charity and posting a #barefootselfie. But why? Well, because, according to the charity Shoe Aid 60 million people across the globe go without the most basic item of clothing every day - footwear. In a bid to raise awareness of the problem, Shoe Aid want to see snaps of your bare feet using the hashtag barefootselfie. A new hashtag on Twitter is encouraging people to post barefoot selfies in order to raise awareness of those who have to go without footwear . The movement is gathering considerable pace and has already seen several celebrities jump on board to help support the cause. Neighbours actor, Bryn Lucas and West End star Connie Fisher shared their barefoot selfies in water where as journalists, Mary Anne Sieghart and Cathy Newman chose to display their polished piggies for the campaign. The campaign is in association with and to help raise the profile of Shoe Aid's annual charity event in Nottingham - The Barefoot Walk. West End musical star Connie Fisher shared her selfie by the pool (left) and actor, Bryn Lucas got his tootsies out in the tub (right) The walk aims to draw people's attention to the plight of those around the world who go barefoot every day through no choice of their own. The movement was founded by Lee Todd who was moved to take action when he saw footage of the Boxing Day Tsunami in 2004 where people had lost everything - right down to the shoes on their feet. Lee started the charity Shoe Aid which collects unwanted shoes and sends them to places they are needed after discovering that in the UK alone we throw away over 2 million pairs of shoes every week. So far, Shoe Aid has sent over 30,000 pairs of shoes to Africa with the help of The National Police Aid Convoy. Artistic: Some twitter users got creative with filters and props whilst posting their barefoot selfies . Polished piggies: Weather girl, Emma Jesson and journalist Mary Ann Sieghart showed off their brightly coloured nails . The Barefoot Walk is now in it's third year and the 2014 event in Nottingham is hoping to break the world record for the largest barefoot walk and will do so if 7,050 people join the event. The Barefoot Walk raises money by charging people to register. Walkers can also download a sponsorship form and ask for additional sponsorship money. The money can then either go to The Barefoot Walk charities (including Shoe Aid, The British Heart Foundation, NSPCC, Double Impact and Rainbow's Children Hospice) or walkers can raise money for their own charities. This way Lee Todd hopes to offer an opportunity for smaller organisations to raise funds. Channel 4 reporter Cathy Newman, does her bit to help raise awareness . English actress Julie Peasgood posts her barefoot selfie and rests her feet on her garden table (left) and Tech reporter Kate Russell perches on a cushion for her selfie (right) Lee says that he hopes by attempting a World Record the event will be attract more walkers than ever before. 'We want Nottingham to back this event, become Guinness World Record holders and show the world what we can do' He adds that going barefoot for a day is something that the walkers are really enthusiastic about. 'People get . excited about it because taking your shoes off is a natural thing, . walking on grass feels great - especially when you know you're raising . money for a great cause.' Singer Stephen Bowman managed to squeeze his face into his barefoot selfie . Toby Hewson, Event Organiser says that by welcoming various charities The Barefoot Walk is seeing a growing interest with the event having expanded enormously since its humble beginnings. 'We have a saying in the Barefoot events team - ""Everybody Welcome - Everybody Wins"" - because the more charities who get on board, the more successful the event will be and the more people we can help . 'It's not a big distance and it's not a race, there is no competition at The Barefoot Walk - just a feeling of everyone coming together for a good time and to raise money for charity. 'In 2012 this event was 30 people and two dogs. In 2013 we put on a great event for hundreds of people. 2014 is going to be huge with thousands predicted to be involved.' The Barefoot Walk Nottingham will take place on Sunday 7th September at Wollaton Park.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . John Kerry's spokesman . has admitted that the Secretary of State did go sailing off Nantucket as . the Egyptian President was ousted from power, after pictures emerged of him out on the water on July 4. The . Secretary of State had been criticized for taking a vacation with his family at his holiday home in Nantucket, as Egypt plunged into crisis. New pictures of Mr Kerry on a kayak and a boat in Nantucket Sound on July 4 have now surfaced after his spokesman forcefully denied he went sailing after an earlier photo was posted to Twitter. Scroll down for video: . Rough crossing: John Kerry is seen boarding a boat in Nantucket Sound on July 4 . Retraction: John Kerry's spokesman was forced to retract her denial that the Secretary of State has been enjoying water sports during the Egyptian crisis . 'It doesn’t look good, and I think it sends the wrong message,' Republican strategist Brad Marston told the Boston Herald. 'If I were advising him, I’d already have him on a plane.' Mr Kerry had already been spotted near July 4 festivities in the center of town earlier in the day, but the latest pictures showed him loading bags into a boat near his holiday home. The State . Department was forced to retract its denial that he had been sailing on Friday, conceding that Mr Kerry had . taken his grandson out on the yacht for an hour on Wednesday. 'While he was briefly on his boat on . Wednesday, Secretary Kerry worked around the clock all day including . participating in the president’s meeting with his national security . council,' spokesman Jen Psaki said. It is a reversal of her original statement, when Ms Psaki had said: 'Any report or tweet that he was on a boat . is completely inaccurate.' His aides even denied Mr Kerry was on a boat when CBS sent them a photo of the Secretary of State on board his yacht. With . the Egyptian military ousting President Morsi and violent deaths being reported in the country, . many people in Nantucket were surprised to see Mr Kerry at his holiday home . rather than in Washington. Time out: As his presidential campaign started to go wrong in 2004 John Kerry was spotted wind surfing . 'I would think the Secretary of State would interrupt his vacation and at least send a very clear signal - even by flying back to Washington for a day or two - that on our Independence Day we are very concerned about the freedom and democracy that we hope is instilled for some period of time in the Arab World,' Patrick Griffin, Republican strategist, said. Mr Kerry's unexpected vacation has been charted on Twitter after residents started noting his moves around the town, which . could have gone unnoticed if it wasn't for a video allegedly showing his . motorcade getting stuck in traffic as he arrived earlier in the week. Despite admitting that he had gone sailing, his aides insisted that Mr Kerry had been in regular phone contact with world leaders and had taken part in White House meetings after the first democratically elected Egyptian president was ousted. An aide to the Secretary of State, who had just returned from a 12-day tour of the Middle East, told the Boston Globe the earlier denial had been a result of 'confusion', and confirmed Mr Kerry had gone sailing with his grandson. According to Ms Psaki he had spoken to leaders and diplomats in Egypt, Israel, Norway, Qatar . and the United Arab Emirates - all while on vacation in Nantucket. However, an aide said none of the phone calls were made while he was on his yacht, according to ABC News. Mr Kerry has been criticized previously for taking to the water during difficult political times. During his 2004 presidential election campaign he drew derision after being pictured wind surfing as his campaign fell apart.

"By . Laura Cox . Twins are always special in a family but these baby sisters are a truly rare double delight. At estimated odds of four-billion-to-one, Jessica and Clara Gwynne represent the fourth generation of twins in one family. They follow in the footsteps of their mother Mel and their grandfather and great-grandmother – all of whom were twins. Double act: Twins Jessica (left) and Clara Gwynne are the fourth consecutive generation in their family . Big shoes to fill: The girls' mother Mel (right) said she has an eerie connection with her twin sister Sherrill . Which is which? The babies' grandfather Kevin (right) grew up with his twin brother Keith . Mrs Gwynne, 36, discovered she was carrying twins at her 12-week scan after spotting the image of a second head on a monitor. She said: ‘It was a bit of a shock really. Although deep down I think I’ve always known that me or my sister Sherrill would have twins. 'They did the scan and I could see on the screen they were looking at the one baby and I saw something else which in the corner and I thought well there’s nothing else that could be round like that apart from another head. 'And I thought no, don’t be silly and then she moved it over and she went “and there’s twin two”.' The girls – who are featured in Channel 4’s One Born Every Minute tonight – were born five weeks premature and spent the first few weeks of life in a special care baby unit. They are now seven months old. Family album: The babies' great-grandmother Joyce Garrad, pictured, also had a twin sister . History: The babies' grandfather Kevin (left) and his twin Keith being held by their mother Joyce, also a twin . Newborns: Clara (left) and Jessica were born to their mother Mel Gwynne prematurely . The pattern for twins in the family began with Jessica and Clara’s great-grandmother, Joyce Garrad, who had a twin named Margaret. Joyce went on to give birth to Kevin and Keith, 60, and Kevin and his wife had Mel and Sherrill. Mel Gwynne, a school kitchen manager from Bristol, is anticipating that her girls will develop the same close bond she shares with her identical sister. However, she and her husband Chris are adamant she won’t dress them in identical clothes. She said: ‘My Nan always used to put me and my sister in the same thing and we hated it. We hated being the same because we were separate people.’ At times she has seen spooky visions of her twin which turned out to be true, she said. 'One . time Sherrill had already gone to school and I was off sick and I woke . up and said to mum “I want to wear my leg warmers” and she said “you’re . not going anywhere, what do you want to wear your leg warmers for?”', . she said. Twice the effort: Mrs Gwynne said she always knew she or her sister would end up having twins .

Sherrill’s knee. And she said she often knows when her sister is about . to phone. In the UK there is a 112-to-one chance of a pregnancy resulting in non-identical twins. US health journal, Forensic Science International, estimate the odds of four generations of twins in one family are one in four billion. However, yesterday Jane Denton of the Multiple Births Foundation said it was difficult to estimate how common fourth generation twins are as it depends on whether they are identical or non-identical, and a database tracking this information is not known about. She said: ‘It is terribly complicated. The rate of identical twinning is fairly constant, for any woman anywhere there is about a three to five per thousand risk. 'But with non-identicals there is a rare gene carried by females. So if a woman carrying the gene has twins, her daughter has a four times greater chance of having twins herself.'

"By . Laura Cox . He chose to step down from hosting Strictly Come Dancing after accepting the ‘rigours’ of working on live television had become too much for him – but declined to elaborate on what they were. Now the director of the popular Saturday night show has revealed what Sir Bruce Forsyth was reluctant to divulge. Nikki Parsons said that his refusal to wear an earpiece – as well as his failing eyesight – made the veteran host a ‘challenge’ to work with and resulted in the autocue getting bigger and closer during each series. Nice to see him: Sir Bruce Forsyth and his former co-host on Strictly Come Dancing Tess Daly . Sir Bruce, 86, announced his decision to quit Strictly in April after ten years of presenting the show issuing a statement in which he said: ‘After ten wonderful years and 11 series, I believe that it is now the right time to step down from the rigours of presenting the Strictly live shows.’ He confirmed he would only continue with presenting the show’s specials and in recent weeks said he feared going off like ‘stale fruit’ if he remained in the post much longer. Now Miss Parsons has admitted that it was becoming a struggle for Sir Bruce to keep up with the weekly filming schedule. Director Nikki Parsons has admitted that it was becoming a struggle for Sir Bruce to keep up with the weekly filming schedule . Speaking at a Bafta Craft Masterclass on Monday night, she said: ‘‘He’s brilliant Bruce, he’s a legend, it’s just that he comes with various things he won’t do which don’t help in the live show. ‘It would be great to be able to say in his ear that something’s happened and give him directions but it’s just a bit like OK Bruce, off you go. And to be honest he’s such a people person that if anything does go wrong you’re in safe hands, because he can make a drama and a comedy out of anything. 'But it is a challenge. And the autocue font has been getting bigger and bigger and getting closer and closer.’ Tess Daly, 45, and Claudia Winkleman, 42, will now co-host the series when it returns this autumn. New hosts: Tess Daly (left) and Claudia Winkleman are the new regular presenters of Strictly Come Dancing, following the departure of Sir Bruce Forsyth . Also speaking at the event was costume designer Vicky Gill, who revealed the surprising secret to making sure everything stays tucked in during energetic dances – she sews a pair of Speedos onto the base hems of shirts. And professional dancer Brendan Cole spoke about his own fears that his days on Strictly might be numbered. As one of only two professionals to have been in the show since it started in 2004, Cole, 38, has partnered celebrities including Lulu, Olympic cyclist Victoria Pendleton and singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor. But his only win was the very first series with ITV newsreader Natasha Kaplinsky. Revealing his concerns, Cole said: ‘We never know before May or June which I think is particularly rude, because actually you can’t plot your end of the year, which you block out for Strictly, and chances are the phone’s gonna ring and they’ll say “Well actually, we’re not gonna use you this series” and you go “Well thanks very much, how am I gonna pay my mortgage?” ‘So there’s that kind of dilemma. But I guess as long as you keep getting better, and bringing new thinks to the table… but they’ve got to keep things fresh. People will come and go, one day it’ll be me and it will be very sad, Strictly is a part of my life.’ A BBC spokesman commented: ‘Strictly director Nikki Parsons has had a great working relationship with Sir Bruce Forsyth for eight years, and she regards him as the ultimate professional. 'The question posed at Bafta regarding his refusal to wear an earpiece is misleading as Bruce isn’t required to wear an earpiece because, as Nikki said, with Bruce you’re in safe hands.’","Refusal to wear an earpiece and failing eyesight made the host, 86, a ‘challenge’ to work with says show boss .

"By . Laura Cox . Billed as a popular entertainment programme, you might expect Britain’s Got Talent to be, well, entertaining. But the show is facing a backlash from its fans after viewers branded the semi-final ‘mind-numbingly boring’. Around a million of the programme’s followers deserted it on Tuesday night, following days of complaints about lengthy advert breaks and the number of foreign acts allowed to compete. 'Mind-numbingly boring': A picture tweeted by Amanda Holden shows David Walliams and Simon Cowell during yesterday's Britain's Got Talent semi-final number three, which was watched by a million fewer viewers . The episode, which saw singer James Smith and dance troupe Addict Initiative put through to the final, was watched by 7.8million viewers – more than a million less than the first semi-final on Monday. Over the course of eight years, the likes of Susan Boyle and Ashleigh and Pudsey have found fame on the variety show. But as one viewer put it on Tuesday: ‘BGT has totally had its day!’ Another wrote on Twitter: ‘Britain’s Got Talent is sooooo mind-numbing #Snooooooze.’ And several even suggested that the  programme should be renamed ‘Britain’s scraping the barrel’. Finalists: BGT dance group Addict Initiative arrive at the ITV studios for a guest appearance on Lorraine . The ratings slump will come as a blow to ITV bosses, who had hoped that this year’s format shake up – which saw the addition of the judges’ ‘golden buzzer’ which can catapult acts to the semi-final – would draw in more viewers. James Smith won the public vote, while the judges – Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and David Walliams – chose Addict Initiative over singer Jodi Bird to go through as well. Canadian magician Darcy Oake and singing group Collabro went through on Monday night. And the remaining six places in the final will be filled throughout the course of this week, from a total of 45 semi-finalists. Sobbing: Singer James Smith won the public vote . Earlier this week Britain’s Got Talent was hit by fury from fans, when they discovered almost 20 minutes of the 90-minute semi-final on Monday was being taken up by adverts. Taking to Twitter, one wrote: ‘Britain’s Got Talent has more adverts than acts! Sort it out #ITV #BGT becoming a bloody joke.’ And in recent weeks the programme has faced criticism about the number of foreign acts to get through the auditions.","Singer James Smith and dancers Addict Initiative make it to the final .

"By . Laura Cox . It's becoming a rather annoying ritual for BBC viewers. You settle down to watch a much-anticipated TV drama – then have to crank up the volume or switch on the subtitles. Just a month after the BBC’s Jamaica Inn was lambasted for its mumbling actors and poor sound quality, the corporation’s latest big release, Quirke, has been hit by the same complaints. Drama: Crime series Quirke, starring Gabriel Byrne, has attracted complaints about its audio quality . Anger: TV star Richard Madeley was one of the viewers to vent his fury about the dialogue . Viewers watching the crime drama on Sunday night were furious when they couldn’t make out what was being said. They reported having to switch on subtitles or turn up the volume to the maximum setting, while others simply gave up and turned it off. Set in 1950s Dublin and based on the novels by Booker Prize-winning author John Banville, Quirke follows the city’s chief pathologist, played by Gabriel Byrne, as he investigates a murder. Pugh's take on the silent drama Quirke . But it seems many of the 4.2million who watched the first episode in the three-part series struggled to follow the action, with TV presenter Richard Madeley leading the complaints on Twitter. Madeley blamed the BBC’s sound editing, writing: ‘Was really looking forward to Quirke, BBC1, 9pm – but despite winding volume up to 100 per cent, still can’t hear at least a third of dialogue! Again! ‘And it’s definitely the programme – switched channels and sound boomed out massively loudly. Back to Quirke, and inaudible. Grrrrrr!!!!’ He persevered with the programme a little longer, then finally announced: ‘Oh well, I give up. Throws ear-trumpet away and hobbles upstairs to bed, prematurely aged by c*** c*** c*** BBCTV sound.’ Another viewer also blamed the quality of the sound editing, tweeting: ‘I spend 99 per cent of my time with subtitles! I’m 35 ... BBC buy new [microphones].’ But others blamed the actors for failing to enunciate properly, likening the effect to the mumbling cast of Jamaica Inn. One viewer wrote: ‘Trying to enjoy BBC’s Quirke but too much mumbling and not enough enunciation! Jamaica Inn revisited?’ Before changing channels, another tweeted: ‘We turned over, can’t be bothered with whispers.’ They weren’t alone in turning off the programme in frustration. Stars: Quirke features actors such as Sir Michael Gambon, left, and Aisling Franciosi, right . Notorious: Jamaica Inn rapidly became known for its problems with inaudible dialogue . Another . Twitter user wrote: ‘How far into Quirke did you get tonight? Shades of . Jamaica Inn – mumbling and dark. Was this same director? Turned off yet . another drama!’ After it was broadcast over Easter, Jamaica Inn generated more than 2,000 complaints about ‘incoherent mumbling’. The . BBC originally said that technical faults were responsible but following an . investigation admitted another problem was that some of the cast . had failed to deliver their lines clearly. Last night there had been no official complaints to the BBC about Quirke or to television watchdog Ofcom.

"By . Laura Cox . It is a matter Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan have clearly discussed at some length in private. But their decision to make public their thoughts on assisted suicide and reveal details of a suicide pact they have made has led to one of television’s most popular couples dividing opinion and exposing themselves to criticism. After 26 years of marriage, the former presenters of ITV’s This Morning said they had made a ‘pledge’ to help one another if they were suffering and considered it the ‘responsibility’ of their partner, regardless of the consequences. Under fire: Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan, pictured in Fowey, Cornwall, on Monday, were yesterday accused by anti-euthanasia campaigners of 'promoting' suicide . Mr Madeley, 57, said he would not hesitate if his wife asked him to give her ‘a little push to go over the edge’ and Miss Finnigan said she would do the same. Under British law, a partner can be prosecuted if they help someone to die. Mr Madeley said he would spare his wife such a fate by joking that he would shoot himself in the head. ‘For me, it would be the locked room, the bottle of whisky and the revolver,’ he said. ‘I wouldn’t want to mess around.’ Devoted: The couple, who have been married for 26 years and have two children together, said on Sunday that they had made a suicide pact if one of them would become seriously ill . Miss Finnigan, 65, was equally . forthright. ‘Stuff it all. We’ve made ourselves give each other a pledge . along those lines,’ she said. However, . they were accused by anti-euthanasia campaigners of ‘promoting’ suicide, with their celebrity status increasing the risk of copycat . agreements. Dr Peter Saunders of Care Not Killing said Mr Madeley’s revolver comment amounted to a breach of World Health Organisation guidelines about the discussion of suicide in the public sphere. The guidelines, which are intended to protect the vulnerable, state that celebrity endorsement is to be avoided and methods should not be discussed. Disability rights campaigner Baroness Campbell, who  is against the legalisation  of assisted suicide, echoed  those concerns. While noting that the couple’s . decision was ‘entirely their own matter’, she added: ‘When it becomes . problematic is because they have a very prominent influence on people. Still going strong: The couple, pictured in 1993, have been married for 26 years . ‘They . have a massive following but what they’re not doing is thinking about . how their decisions may impact upon other people and the adverse effect . this could have on people. ‘They . have a very influential voice and the people who will suffer will be . those who are  vulnerable to influence and coercion. 'While everyone has a . right to an opinion, I don’t think what they’ve done is responsible.’ However, Dignity in Dying, which supports assisted suicide, welcomed the debate ignited  by the couple. ‘This . is a conversation that needs to be had and any discussion about it . going on in the public sphere is a positive thing,’ said a spokesman. The couple have two children together – Chloe and Jack – and Miss Finnigan has two sons from a previous marriage. They were last on TV screens regularly five years ago but remain well-known due to their book club, which is now in its tenth year. The couple, who became grandparents 18 months ago, revealed that they decided to confront the issue when Mr Madeley’s mother died last month. He said that although she had Alzheimer’s and lung cancer, her death came as a shock. Miss Finnigan added: ‘It’s just the shock of death. It is so final … I suspect that the closer you get to your own mortality, the more final it seems.’ Assisted suicide remains a criminal offence in England and Wales, technically punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Guidelines issued in 2010 indicated that anyone acting with compassion on the will of a dying person is unlikely to face charges. Severely ill Britons are increasingly ending their lives by travelling to clinics abroad, such as Dignitas in Switzerland.","TV couple revealed details of a suicide pact yesterday .

"By . Laura Cox . End of the road: Comedian and actor John Cleese, 74, will not perform any silly walks in Monty Python's reunion shows - because he has a dodgy knee . It sounds like an excuse Basil Fawlty might use... John Cleese will not perform any silly walks in Monty Python’s reunion shows – because he has a dodgy knee. The Ministry of Silly Walks, which was first broadcast on the Flying Circus in 1970, saw Cleese striding in and out of meetings in a series of government-approved walks. But now aged 74 and having suffered problems with his knee, Cleese can no longer perform the energetic routine. And confirming the sketch will be absent from the reunion line-up, Michael Palin, 71, said on Monday night during a talk at the National Theatre: ‘John won’t be able to do the silly walks because of his knee. 'When we were doing the show in New York in 1976 he did not want to do the silly walks then as it is very hard work. We have thought about getting a ballet dancer in.’ Referring to Cleese’s expensive mulit-million divorce from his third wife, before he married his fourth, Jennifer Wade, 42, in 2012, Palin joked: ‘John has not been able to get his leg over since the alimony.’ Among the well-known acts which will feature in July’s shows are the Spanish Inquisition sketches, known for catchphrases including ‘Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition’. And there will be clips of late Python Graham Chapman, who died following a cancer battle in 1989. And Palin also revealed that the ‘fish-slapping dance’ which ends with the comic falling into a lock after Cleese clobbers him on the head with a halibut, will be shown – albeit on television screens. He said of the sketch, which first appeared in Flying Circus: ‘You will see me hit by a fish but it will be on a large screen unfortunately. We did that sketch in Teddington Lock and I am very proud of that fall.’ No doubt recreating the stunt on stage would have been rather trying for the cast, who have a combined age of 361. And Palin went on to admit he and his fellow Pythons – Cleese, Terry Gilliam, 73, Terry Jones, 72 and Eric Idle, 71 – have also struggled with the number of costume changes during rehearsals. Pythons: The Ministry of Silly Walks saw Cleese striding in and out of meetings in a series of government-approved walks. Above, Pythons (l-r) John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle and Terry Jones . Palin said: ‘I am a little bit apprehensive as we have not done anything together for a while and it is going to be a big show, we have dancers and god knows what else. ‘We have got to go off and do costume changes. I have about ten costume changes including one in drag and one as a Spanish cardinal. When you are over 70 they clearly take a bit of time. I am just hoping we can get through it.’ The reunion tour will see the comedy troupe perform a number of dates at London’s O2 Arena in July and marks the first time they will be on stage together in 30 years. Confirmation: Comic Michael Palin (left), 71, confirmed the sketch (right) will be absent from the reunion line-up . It was announced last November, with tickets selling out in 45 seconds, and comes after several failed attempts to reform by the group. The Pythons were last seen together in 1983’s The Meaning Of Life and Palin admitted they remain fiercely competitive, as he joked: ‘if anyone does anything individually that fails then we all love that’. But they reportedly realised it was ‘now or never’ to get back together. Palin said they were also motivated by the money at stake from the 20,000 tickets sold, which cost up to £495 each. Making an appearance: There will, however, be clips of late Python Graham Chapman, who died following a cancer battle in 1989. Above, a cardboard cut-out of Chapman is held by Terry Jones (left) and Michael Palin . He said: ‘John (Cleese) wanted more money . for his divorce settlement. I think it is his fourth wife. I have not . seen him for two weeks, he might be married again. ‘Terry kept going on about his mortgage in Highgate and a guy called Jim Beach, who was the manager of Queen, asked “Why don’t you do the O2, you can make your money back”. And everyone said yes. ‘There was not that much debate. The prospect of making jokes again was never a problem as we all pull together but it was the business and lifestyle that we have differences over. Comedy is a lovely thing to do with the guys. We said yes and now we are stuck with it.’","John Cleese will not perform silly walks in Monty Python reunion shows .

"By . Ashley Collman . and Ryan Gorman . and Laura Cox . A girl who was just 10 years old when she was charged with killing a baby in her mother's care pleaded guilty on Wednesday to several misdemeanors in a plea deal. A judge signed off on the deal which dropped manslaughter charges against Kelli Murphy, now 12, in a closed-door hearing. As part of the deal, Murphy will submit to a treatment plan and remain in the custody of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services until she turns 18. 'I'm . satisfied with the outcome. It was the best that we could accomplish . given the complexities of the case and the age of the juvenile,' Deputy Attorney General William Stokes said. Murphy was first charged in the death of 3-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenway in July 2012. Tragic: 12-year-old Kelli Murphy pleaded guilty to several manslaughter charges in connection to the 2012 death of 3-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenway (pictured) The charges stem from a night in which the baby stayed over at Murphy's house with Murphy's mother babysat the infant. An autopsy and toxicology performed on the baby found . large quantities of the same prescription medication Murphy took to control her Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The deal comes after the baby's mother Nicki Greenaway called for charges against Murphy's mother Amanda Huard. She said the woman was neglectful in watching Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway, and that she should be held liable for her conduct. The state disagreed. 'Legally speaking, it’s not possible,' Stokes said. 'One of the things we have to prove in any death is causation, and we don’t have any evidence that [Huard] caused anybody’s death.' The juvenile petition against Murphy . contained no additional details about the case, including Brooklyn's cause of death, but the baby's mother, Nicki Greenaway, claims to have been told her child was suffocated. When Greenaway saw her daughter for the first time at a funeral home, the baby had a black eye, bruises on her nose and marks that looked like fingerprints on her cheeks, she said. 'Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway has died as a result of your neglect,' said a notice delivered to the mother in the weeks after her child's death. 'You knew that (the 10-year-old) should not be babysitting children but have continued to allow her to do so.' Gone too soon: Baby Brooklyn died while in the care of Murphy and her mother - who was babysitting that night . Brooklyn's mother, Nicki, said traces of the 10-year-old's medication was found in her daughter's system . Murphy had already been labeled as a . danger to children before Foss-Greenaway's death, according to documents from the DHHS which detail . that she suffers behavioral problems, including oppositional defiant . disorder, ADHD and attachment . disorder. Former tenants of Huard's house also claimed Murphy also harmed their baby. Ashley Tenney and Chad Hopkins have . named the 10-year-old as being responsible for their daughter's . hospitalisation in June, brought on by sudden seizures. Doctors found the same medication in eight-month-old Jaylynn's system that is used by the accused girl to control her attention deficit hyperactivity disorder after they had been left alone together. Tenney and Hopkins were living with in the basement of Huard's home, the Maine Sunday Telegram reported. They say the girl was alone with . their daughter in June 2012, while Hopkins was elsewhere in the house and . Tenney was out at work. The . couple trusted the girl, they said, that she had shown a 'healthy . interest' in their daughter up until that point, offering to help with . diaper changes and bathing. When Tenney arrived home from her shift at Dunkin' Donuts she found her daughter pale and sweating. 'She was soaked in sweat, just drenched,' said Tenney, 20. 'She was so pale. Whiter than a sheet of paper.' As they rushed her to the emergency room at MaineGeneral Medical Centre in Waterville, Jaylynn began convulsing and fitting. 'She . was on her father's lap, and her head just dropped back, and she . rapidly started shaking,' Tenney said. 'The first one lasted like 20 . seconds.' The sudden seizures baffled doctors at first as they struggled to work out what had brought them on. Medical experts consulted one another and Jaylynn was transferred to Maine Medical Centre in Portland to be reassessed. Shock: Ashley Tenney (left) claims Murphy was also responsible for her daughter Jaylynn's (right) hospitalisation in June . 'If her head went to the left her arm . went to the right and vice versa,' she said. 'Her heart rate was high . and they were worried and didn't know what to do for her.' In . Portland doctors probed Tenney about what medications were in Huard's . house, matching up the 10-year-old's attention deficit hyperactivity . disorder drugs with what they found in Jaylynn's system. So . much was detected, Tenney said, that her daughter 'should have been . dead'. She added that there 'wasn't any way' she could have ingested the . medication on her own. In . the days following the scare, Tenney and Hopkins began looking for a new . place to live, sickened by the belief that Huard's daughter had . deliberately hurt their own. She . said she had found a canvas bag in a drawer in the 10-year-old's . bedroom, filled with more than 100 photographs of Jaylynn, some torn, . others with words like 'my baby girl' written on them. The . couple were interviewed by workers from the DHHS Office of Child and . Family Services, as were with the 10-year-old and her mother. All four . were told that the girl should not be given care of young children. But despite the warnings the girl was once again left alone with a toddler just three weeks later, this time with three-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway whose mother, Nicki, had left in Huard's care overnight.","On Wednesday, Kelli Murphy pleaded guilty to several misdemeanor charges in a plea deal .

"By . Laura Cox . Picture a group of monkeys and you might imagine them swinging from trees, gathering bananas or perhaps squabbling over scraps of food. But from toasting marshmallows on a camp fire to writing with paper and pen and flossing their teeth, these primates have found better ways to pass the time. And here they are practising their remarkably human-like skills in a series of images that have never been seen before. Scroll down for video . Resourceful long-tailed macaques in Thailand use human hairs plucked from tourists to floss between their teeth, in a new three-part documentary on BBC1 called Monkey Planet . Kanzi the bonobo lives in America and has learnt how to build a fire, light it using matches, and toast marshmallows on it. It shows just how like us some primates really are . There’s . Kanzi the Illinois-based bonobo, who orders picnics on a smartphone, . using technology that would baffle even some humans. He can also cook fry-ups on fires he has built, lighting piles of broken tree branches with a match. And . to satisfy a sweet tooth, the dexterous primate toasts even uses his . homemade fire to toast marshmallows he has skewered on a twig. Then there’s the orang-utan who has taught himself how to write, gripping a pen in the fist of his hand. And resourceful long-tailed macaques in Thailand use human hairs plucked from tourists to floss between their teeth. Tonight the monkeys will be seen in the first episode of a three-part documentary on BBC1 called Monkey Planet. It will see zoologist and presenter Dr George McGavin travel the globe to seek out the most interesting primates in the wild. Unlike . some other species, many of them live in close knit communities, where . they encounter situations that may be familiar to some humans. Take . the hierarchical system for hamadryas baboons in Ethiopia, for example, . where the dictatorial males dictate over their packs. And in Peru, male emperor tamarins are conned into childcare. Griller in the mist: Kanzi builds a fire from dry twigs and skilfully strikes a match to light it . MasterChef: His hands look almost human as he deftly skewers a marshmallow on a branch . Much . of their activities are governed by need – such as an elaborate alarm . system South African vervet monkeys use to warn of predators. While thieving rhesus macaques in India stage lookouts as their peers raid properties for food. But . just like us humans, there’s room for fun in their lives as well, as . proven by the primates cannon balling into a pool of water. And . enjoying what appears to be the equivalent of a spa day, their cousins . in Japan spend their days languishing in hot springs, while delighted . tourists take their photographs. Dr . McGavin, who has appeared in several other BBC documentaries including . Ultimate Swarms and Lost Land of the Tiger, spent a year visiting . primates to learn about how they behave. Those with the largest brains, . such as apes and orang-utans, he said, were the most equipped to copy . human traits, and could be taught how to do things like writing. That smells good: Kanzi stays a safe distance from the flames as he toasts the sweet . Those with the largest brains, such as apes and orangutans were the most equipped to copy human traits, and could be taught to do things such as fishing . But smaller primates, like macaques, will adapt their behaviour because of the environment they are in. Dr . McGavin said: ‘You can have the same species in two different places . and their behaviour will be different. With the macaques in Thailand for . example, one of them will have realised they could use a strand of . human hair to get annoying bits of food out of their teeth and the . others will have copied. In another part of Thailand, where there are . fewer tourists, they won’t do the same.’ What . most of it comes down to however, Dr McGavin said, is a desire for . food. And it is why the Indian macaques, living in rural areas, have . evolved to scale buildings because they know it comes from inside. Dr . McGavin said: ‘Animals like this adapt to their habitat very, very . easily. So as opposed to having a jungle vine you’ve got power lines and . it’s actually the same. You basically swing through those and instead . of food being hidden as a prize in the trees it’s inside the buildings. They just have to work out how to get hold of it. That’s evidence of how their brains work.’","Resourceful long-tailed macaques in Thailand use human hairs plucked from tourists to floss between their teeth .

"By . Laura Cox . As she nears her 81st birthday, Joan Collins could have been forgiven for thinking about retirement. But instead, the actress has stepped into a new role – as creator of a cosmetics range that’s flying off the shelves. Products from her Timeless Beauty line for shopping channel QVC have proved so popular that many sold out within an hour of her first appearance this month. Diva: Shopping channel QVC says viewers have rushed to imitate the look worn by Joan Collins . Familiar face: The star's appearance followed adverts for Snickers in which she poked fun at her reputation . A £23 foundation, a crystal compact . mirror at £33, a lipstick for £25.50 and a £32 ‘eyelift in a bottle’ all . proved best-sellers for Miss Collins, as viewers rushed to copy her . glamorous Hollywood style. And . three subsequent shows on the satellite channel saw two other products . sell out within the hour – a fragrance called I am Woman, priced at £21, . and a £17 Fade To Perfect concealer. Miss . Collins has picked up a number of beauty tricks and tips throughout her . lengthy career – including from Marilyn Monroe’s make-up artist Allan . Snyder – and no doubt will have encompassed many into her 18-piece . range. Yesterday, QVC’s . senior beauty buyer Sandra Vallow explained that customers were . desperate to recreate the glamour of Miss Collins as Alexis Carrington . Colby in Dynasty during her 1980s heyday. She . said: ‘Who wouldn’t want to own an Alexis lipstick? The QVC beauty . buying team were so excited to be launching the Joan Collins cosmetics . collection and it didn’t disappoint. Splashing out: A crystal compact mirror has set buyers back £33 while the lip and nail kit costs £25 . Star: Miss Collins, pictured with her new range, was named England's most beautiful girl at the age of 18 . ‘With six sell-out products it just shows that Joan’s glamour and beauty is inspiring for customers of all ages.’ Miss Collins was just 18 when she was voted the Most Beautiful Girl in England by the Photographers Association. She . made her name as a Hollywood star in her 20s, and went on to land the . role of Alexis in 1981, when she was 48. Although the beauty range is a . first for Miss Collins, she has also put her name to several popular . novels she has penned. Most . recently she took part in a Snickers advertisement, in which she poked . fun at her reputation for being a diva. And she has appeared in a number . of other commercials, including one for high street retailer Marks and . Spencer. Her latest venture . makes her one of a number of stars to have enjoyed success selling . products on QVC, which has seen a turn-around in its fortunes from the . days when it was dismissed as a poor alternative to the high street. Career: The star was 22 when she left Britain for Hollywood and landed sultry roles in several popular films . Actress: Miss Collins later returned to the stage in 1980s and starred in a revival of Noel Coward's Private Lives . Now it is the world’s most watched television retailer and reaches 26million homes in the UK. Miss Collins will next be appearing on the channel on May 30 and May 31. The star was 22 when she headed to Hollywood and landed sultry roles in several popular films, including The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing (1955) and Rally ’Round the Flag, Boys! (1958). While she continued to make films in the US and the UK throughout the 1960s, her career languished in the 1970s, where she appeared in a number of horror movies. Near the end of the decade, she starred in two films based on best-selling novels by her younger sister Jackie. Returning to her theatrical roots, she also played the title role in the 1980 British revival of The Last of Mrs. Cheyney and later had a lead role in the 1990 revival of Noel Coward’s Private Lives. She won a Golden Globe  Award for Best Actress in 1982  and received a star on the  Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1983 for career achievement.","Her Timeless Beauty collection includes £23 foundation and £25.50 lipstick .

"By . Laura Cox . A farmer admitted yesterday that he shot dead a cocker spaniel belonging to actress Sue Johnston. Gordon Glover said he shot the one-year-old dog after it attacked livestock, killing his grandson’s pet chicken. He had initially denied seeing the dog. Miss Johnston, 70, is said to be heartbroken after learning of the death of her pet, named Bo. A farmer has insisted he only shot dead Coronation Street star Sue Johnston's dog because it killed his chickens. Gordon Glove, 69, said he killed one-year-old Bo, and another cocker spaniel, after the pair ran 'wild' into his yard in Marton, near Macclesfield and killed his chickens . The Coronation Street and Royle Family . star had appealed for Bo’s return when she went missing last week. The . actress, who also appeared in Brookside, had been searching frantically . for Bo, who ran off with another dog while being walked by a . professional dog walker. Gordon Glover insists he only killed the dogs with a shotgun because they were biting his chickens . The . dog walker, who gave her name only as Kim, asked local farmers – . including 69-year-old Mr Glover – if they had seen the dogs but they all . said no. Yesterday Mr Glover said he felt awful after killing Bo and . the other dog, a cocker spaniel called Hattie, with his shotgun. He said the dogs were running wild and had attacked his hens, killing one in front of his grandsons. ‘I . tried to drive them away but couldn’t and in the end I got my gun,’ he . said. ‘My grandsons are only five and two and they were in floods of . tears. I didn’t know what else to do. I don’t understand why the dogs . weren’t kept on a lead.’ Mr . Glover said he buried both dogs on his farm near Marton, Cheshire. Bo . and Hattie were among several dogs with the dog walker on Tuesday last . week. She said they chased after a rabbit. ‘Even . though I shouted they didn’t come back. I was looking for them for . days,’ she added. ‘On Friday I went round all the farms with . photographs. I even went to see the farmer who shot them – but he denied . having seen them. ‘Sue’s my friend. It’s dreadful for her and nobody could feel worse than I do. I’ve also lost Hattie, who was my baby.’ Cheshire . Police contacted Mr Glover but said he was legally entitled to shoot . the dogs. The farmer said he was too embarrassed to admit that he had . killed them when approached by the dog walker. Miss . Johnston, who is best known for playing Barbara Royle in The Royle . Family and who has just left Coronation Street, was not available for . comment yesterday. She is . said to be ‘devastated’ by Bo’s death.

"By . Laura Cox . Convinced she would never find the right man to settle down and have children with, Jo Stretton donated her eggs in a selfless act of generosity to help infertile women. Following a break-up from a boyfriend of seven years, she feared she might never become a mother and at the age of 30 decided to give away her eggs because she wanted ‘a part of me out there’. However, five years later, Miss Stretton met her partner Mark Fenton – and in a distressing turn of events found herself needing  fertility treatment after discovering they were unable to conceive. Selfless: Jo Stretton gave away her eggs for IVF aged 30 - then discovered she would need help conceiving herself. After spending £6,000 she is now blessed with Finlay, two, and Sullivan, four months . Unusual: Miss Stretton and her partner Mark Fenton used intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment (ICSI) Satisfied: But Miss Stretton could face a third child turning up on her doorstep in eight years' time, as the law means that anyone born from her donated eggs can contact her once they've turned 18 . Hoping for the best, the couple underwent two rounds of  intracytoplasmic sperm injection  treatment (ICSI) at a cost of £6,000 a time, and moved from their two-bedroom flat to a large family home on a new estate with good primary schools nearby. Miss Stretton also reduced her hours as an accountant, while cutting back on alcohol and eating foods rich in zinc and iron. Speaking from her Bristol home yesterday, she said: ‘Basically I just relaxed. I became more content and went more with the flow and I was happier in our new surroundings. I’d reached that point where  I was no longer fighting my way  up the career ladder and I was a  lot more calm.’ Fortunately for the couple, both ICSI rounds were successful and they are now parents to Finlay, two, and Sullivan, four months – whose birth was filmed for a forthcoming episode of the Channel 4 programme One Born Every Minute. But as she plays with her two boys, satisfied her family is now complete, Miss Stretton is only too aware that in around eight years’ time there could be a third child arriving on her doorstep. For Miss Stretton has learnt that one of the eggs she donated conceived a child – a daughter who is now ten. Excitement: Although she wouldn't make contact, Miss Stretton often thinks about a donor child turning up . Changes in the law, which took place just before Miss Stretton donated, mean that children produced as the result of donated eggs or sperm can contact the donor once they have reached 18. And Miss Stretton and Mr Fenton, 38, who are due to marry this May, have had to prepare themselves for the possibility. Speaking about her unusual family situation, Miss Stretton said that far from resenting her donation, she sought comfort in the knowledge that she had at one stage helped to produce a child. She added: ‘I don’t want to make contact but I’m quite happy for the child to. That’s up to them.’ Laura Witjens, chairman of the National Gamete Donation Trust, last night agreed that Miss Stretton’s situation was unusual. She said: ‘The vast majority of women who donate their eggs have had their family already, for precisely this reason.’ However, Miss Stretton has admitted she is quite excited at the prospect of her daughter arriving. She said: ‘Every now and again I think “one day I could have a random person turn up at my door”.’ Stardom: The birth of Sullivan will be featured on Channel 4's fly-on-the-wall show One Born Every Minute .","Jo Stretton gave away her eggs aged 30 to have 'a part of me out there'

"By . Laura Cox . Blast from the past: Laura Hollowell, 25, is keeping alive the tradition of victory rolls - a hairstyle popular in the 1940s and 50s . It was a hairstyle made famous before Laura Hollowell was even born. But inspired by her grandmother, the 25-year-old is keeping alive the tradition of creating victory rolls that were popular in the 1940s and 50s and worn by actresses Rita Heyworth and Katharine Hepburn. Miss Hollowell uses the labour intensive art of pin curling to work painstakingly with inch-wide sections of hair winding each piece into precise curls before pinning them in rows around her head. She then covers the whole lot with a head scarf and will then wait for up to eight hours before taking it all out and starting work sculpting it into a victory roll - which involves sweeping the top section of hair into a wave and leaving the rest loose. It is a lot of effort to create the dated style, especially when hot tools like curling tongs could achieve similar in a matter of minutes. But for Miss Hollowell the authenticity of the creation is all part of the thrill. And she has even forged a business out of her passion, charging between £5 and £50 to style other women inside a garden shed she has turned into a studio. ‘If you’re doing the pin curl set it gets you feeling a part of that world even more,’ she said. ‘It’s all part of the experience. And also it gives a better result, you get a better set if you pin curl it rather than doing it with a tong. There’s lots of different ways to do it but I like it that way.’ She added: ‘The pin curling is like your foundation to creating different styles and then you can expand.’ As well as the pop up studio, which Miss Hollowell made with her parents, she also creates online video tutorials, teaching people how to recreate her style. Star style: Actresses Rita Hayworth, pictured left, and Katherine Hepburn, pictured right, both wore victory rolls . Inspiration: Miss Hollowell's grandmother Christine, Auntie Ellie and cousin Connie, pictured in Weymouth in 1958, first sparked her passion for the style . Dressed as her alter ego Madame Medusa . in a neat grey skirt suit, black Mary Jane shoes and, of course, a . victory roll, she guides viewers through the process, which she learnt . from reading old fashioned books. And sitting in her studio, surrounded by nostalgic relics and photographs of ‘Granny Jane’, 70, who inspired her to recreate the styles she saw in her favourite musicals from the past, Miss Hollowell said: ‘I think women back then, especially in in the 40s with the war, women had to ration their clothing so all they had to make themselves was to do their hair and make-up and it was a big thing for themselves to make themselves feel special.’ She added: ‘What I love is the innocence of it all, just waiting for your husband to come home, going dancing and spending the day in your pin curls waiting for him. That element of it just seems very romantic and that definitely appeals to me.’ Successful  business: Laura Hollowell has transformed a shed into her garden into a studio where she can create traditional victory rolls for clients . Miss Hollowell's hair studio where she charges between £5 and £50 for different styles . So much so, it would seem, that Miss Hollowell has taken her unlikely hobby to BBC3 programme Hair (she will feature in Tuesday night’s episode), to compete among eight other stylists. And she hopes to win the contest with her styles drawn from films of the past. She said: ‘I look to the past to get inspiration, especially old movies and things. I remember watching them as a kid with my granny so definitely since then. We used to get dressed up and we would act out scenes from musicals. We always used to watch Calamity Jane with Dorris Day, over and over again. But I love Betty Grable, her movies, she’s got amazing hair.’ The end result: A model shows off her perfectly styled victory rolls . Step one: Apply setting lotion to wet hair to help curls form . Step two: Divide into one-inch sections, ready to make pin curls . Step three: Take the first piece of hair, wind into a loop and pin flat . Step four: Repeat for each piece, creating rows down head . Step five: Leave pin curls for at least six hours or overnight . Step six: Take out all pins and brush the hair with a bristle brush . Step seven: Select a triangle of hair on one side of the parting at the front of the head . Step eight: Backcomb the roots of this section to add volume . Step nine: Roll the section down towards the head and pin in place, leaving rest of the hair loose . Step ten: Finish with hair spray. Create a second roll if desired .","Laura Hollowell, 25, uses traditional methods to create victory rolls .

"By . Laura Cox . Abuse: Nick Knowles and his wife Jessica Rose, pictured at the Chelsea Flower Show, have received an online backlash after announcing he won;t be present at the birth of their first child . It is a deeply personal decision for any couple – but the revelation that Nick Knowles will not attend the birth of his child has sparked a very public debate. The television presenter, who already has three children, has admitted he will not be present when his first child with wife Jessica is born in August. Knowles attended the births of two of his children, but confessed to feeling ‘useless’ on both occasions. And Mrs Knowles, 26, said she would prefer her 51-year-old husband not to see her in such a ‘vulnerable state’ adding: ‘Giving birth is a very physical process. I prefer a bit of smoke and mirrors.’ But yesterday, she was said to be in tears over the online backlash against her comments, with messages on internet sites calling her ‘selfish’ and ‘immature’. Critics accused her of ‘banning’ her husband from being by her side, with one writing: ‘What a selfish woman she is not wanting to share this most joyous moment with the baby’s father. I’m not sure she is ready to be a mum, sounds far too immature. I think she will regret it when she grows up.’ Another wrote: ‘In this day and age I feel that it’s a bit selfish to exclude a father from seeing his child come into the world.’ A third said: ‘It takes two to tango and to make a baby, therefore the father should be just as much a part of the birth as he is the conception.’ The backlash follows a magazine interview in which the couple announced the pregnancy. In it, the quiz show star admitted he would not witness his son’s birth in August, despite being present when ex-wife Gillian gave birth to his two oldest children – Charles, 20, and Tuesday, 19. He also has another son by a former lover. The DIY SOS star has now defended his wife, stressing they reached a joint decision by ‘speaking honestly and listening to each other’. He said: ‘The rabid and abusive trolling on social media of my wife over the decision by us both that I not be in the room at the forthcoming birth of our child (I will be right outside) … left her in tears. Nick with Jessica as they both cuddle her baby bump in Hello! magazine . ‘I think it is a mark of how brainwashed we are on the subject that people, and women in particular, can be so abusive to her on a choice that is ours and ours alone.’ In the interview in this week’s Hello! magazine, the couple, who married in 2012, discussed their plans for a water birth where Mrs Knowles would be accompanied by a friend who was ‘not too emotionally involved’. And Mr Knowles said: ‘There’s a huge amount of guilt, fear and worry on a man’s behalf when their partner gives birth, along with a feeling of complete uselessness, so I’m more than happy to take Jess’s lead on this.’ Nick with Jessica at Royal Ascot on Ladies Day last year .","DIY SOS star, 51, is expecting his first child with wife Jessica, 26 .

"By . Laura Cox . Jane Goldman has deleted her Twitter account after husband Jonathan Ross was subjected to a hate campaign. Ross, 53, announced yesterday that his screenwriter wife, 43, had left the social networking site following three days of abusive messages targeting him. It began on Saturday just hours after it emerged that he would be hosting the Hugo Awards  ceremony in August. Upset: Jane Goldman (pictured left with her husband) has quit Twitter after users insulted her husband. Jonathan Ross has presented several awards, including at the Classic BRIT Awards 2013 in London (right) He has since stepped down from the event, which celebrates science fiction, but that did not stop the backlash. Echoing the Andrew Sachs scandal of six years ago, in which Ross was attacked for a sick practical joke he played on the veteran actor that involved a string of lewd comments about his granddaughter, Twitter users had taken to the site to vent their fury. They said Ross, who has a long history . of controversy, was an unsuitable host for the ceremony, which . celebrates science fiction as part of the Worldcon convention. ‘A white man famous for humour denigrating women? I’m the opposite of excited,’ one wrote, while another posted: ‘Good to know women and other minorities need not attend, then.’ And amid the chaos, which involved a . Worldcon organiser resigning, Ross posted that he had decided to step . down from hosting duties. Host: Ross presented the British Comedy Awards last year, pictured with comedian Lee Mack . It did not stop there, however, with writer Seanan McGuire continuing to make digs at the comedian. She wrote: ‘I’ve really enjoyed knowing that, were I to be nominated for a Hugo, the host wouldn’t see me and make fat jokes. 'Like, that thought has actually crossed my mind when shopping for Hugo Dresses, “the host won’t mock me”.’ Ross’s daughter Honey Kinney, 17, defended her father, saying she was overweight and he was ‘kind and sensitive towards women’s body issues’. But the abuse continued. And Miss Goldman deleted her account with a parting shot at Miss McGuire: ‘Reading all your yay! Women! Tweets this morning, while you rudely ignore a real, live 17-year-old girl whom you hurt deeply with you words, is jaw-dropping. Backlash: Ross and Russell Brand faced complaints after leaving a rude message for Andrew Sachs . ‘You falsely accuse her . father of sizeism, she gathers the courage to speak to a bullying adult . with 12.5k followers and you ignored her and casually blathered on about . the Oscars. 'Don’t worry about the three real women whose weekend you . ruined (me and my daughter). ‘Women . like you. Who worry about what to wear and get called fat.

"By . Laura Cox . Growing pains: Splash TV presenter Gabby Logan has revealed she suffered body 'angst' when she was a teenager . Gabby Logan has revealed she suffered body ‘angst’ when she was a teenager and that she now worries her daughter could go through the same. Yesterday the Splash! TV presenter admitted she and her husband worry that Lois, who is eight, could develop body image issues as she grows up. It is a concern that may stem from her own experiences of her changing body when she was at the peak of her sporting career. Mrs Logan represented Wales in rhythmic gymnastics but was forced to retire from the sport aged 17 due to sciatica. She kept a diary during her teenage years and admitted that she wrote about feeling uncomfortable with her changing body once she hit puberty. Mrs Logan, 40, who co-presented Olympics 2012 for the BBC alongside Clare Balding, made her comments in a wide-ranging interview in which she spoke about the importance of healthy eating in her family and being able to recognise hunger. Opening up about her family’s lifestyle, and her daughter, who appears to have inherited her mother’s sporty genes and is a keen gymnast and swimmer,  Mrs Logan, 40, said: ’I would never want my daughter to think she had to eat less of something. 'We talk about over eating, about how that’s not good, to eat more than you need to. ‘But at the same time you can give those messages without it being about body image, it’s about health again. It all comes back to health as opposed to being svelte or fitting into your jeans.’ The presenter went on to talk about a diary she kept as a child, in which wrote fearfully about her developing body. Mrs Logan, who is married to Kenny, 41, said: ‘I was always aware, when you do gymnastics you’re always in a leotard – you can’t be any more, the next thing is being naked. 'And so you’re very aware of your body . so when I hit puberty I didn’t want to change. I wanted to stay a . little girl’s body, I didn’t want to become a woman, it didn’t feel that . it was right. ‘So at first . I wasn’t really embracing the changes, and thinking “oh no, I want to . keep looking like this”. And I don’t know why I worried, I was never . going to get big boobs, and I was never going to be that curvy, nobody . in my family is really. Ratings hit: Gabby Logan with fellow Splash presenters Vernon Kaye, left and Tom Daley, centre . 'But even the tiniest changes when . you’re 12 or 13 make a big difference. And the irony was a few of my . friends were really curvy and all the boys thought they were great. 'Boys didn’t like me, but I didn’t care, I was like “I want to go and do gymnastics, I’m not bothered about that”. ‘So . I remember feeling, in fact I found some old diaries full of angst – . and that’s somebody who had a healthy attitude towards their body. 'But . obviously it’s a common issue with most young girls. You’ve got to . empower them with something that makes them see their body as something . other than a portal for clothes or looking good for boys.’ Like any family, perhaps, the Logans have some health issues in their history. Mrs . Logan’s brother, Daniel, collapsed and died aged 15 from what was later . discovered to be congenital heart disease, while Mr Logan’s mother, . Elizabeth, was a Coeliac, which led to Mr Logan cutting out wheat from . his diet. Mrs Logan dishes out large portions to her former Scottish rugby player husband Kenny and their twins, Lois and Reuben, but her own plateful will be smaller . But Mrs Logan, who has joined a Tesco healthy eating campaign called Eat Happy, insisted they are not ‘faddy’ about food. She said: ‘Kenny and I aren’t faddy at all, apart from Kenny’s mum’s a coeliac so Kenny doesn’t eat wheat. 'So . we have a lot of wheat-free food in the house, which doesn’t really . affect anything because I’m not really prone to throwing loads of flour . into sauces or anything like that.’ She added: ‘And we don’t eat very much red meat, we try and limit it to a couple of times a month.’ But . while Mrs Logan dishes out large portions to her former Scottish rugby . player husband and their twins, Lois and Reuben, her own plateful will . be smaller. Despite doing a . gym session or yoga class four or five times a week, she has days when . she eats very little. And she admitted her diet is similar to the 5:2 . fast, which sees followers eat just 500 calories two days a week. ‘I’ve . always done that in the sense that if I have a really big day – I’ve . gone to a lunch, say, and then I’ve had to go to a dinner – the next day . I probably don’t feel as hungry, so subconsciously I don’t eat so much. Mrs Logan with fellow BBC sports presenters Clare Balding, left, and Gary Lineker, centre . 'That seems to make sense to me. You don’t feel as hungry if you’ve eaten loads.’ She added: ‘As you get older you definitely notice it and your metabolism gets slower and you just don’t eat as big a portion. 'If you don’t ever feel hungry, that’s probably not right, if you don’t ever feel that sense of [hunger] which I don’t know if we do in the western world anymore.’ The Tesco campaign, which Mrs Logan is a part of, involves allowing primary school children to visit farms and food sources. It is a long term programme that aims to cut levels of obesity in the UK. And speaking of her reasons for becoming involved, she said: ‘I get really frustrated when I drive along and see a 12 year old boy who is stuffing his face with really unhealthy fast food and is clearly overweight. ‘That problem is not going to get any better unless someone intervenes and helps that child understand what that food’s doing to him.’","Presenter reveals she kept diaries as a teenager and wrote about wanting to stay a little girl’s body.

"By . James Salmon . Follow @@JamesSalmon79 . Douglas Flint, HSBC chairman, who has criticised the time it takes to comply with new banking regulations . HSBC staff are suffering from fatigue as they struggle with tighter restrictions on how they sell investments, the bank’s chairman said yesterday. Revealing a slump in profits and a spiralling compensation bill for mis-selling, Douglas Flint criticised the time and money needed to comply with the ‘unprecedented’ raft of new regulations. These include a crackdown on financial advice to protect customers after a series of scandals, and ‘ring-fencing’ rules that force lenders to insulate their high street retail arms from their investment banks. He said staff were reluctant to sell anything but the simplest products because they were nervous about falling foul of City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority. He claimed beleaguered staff were tired out from having to work on Saturdays and Sundays to adapt to the regulations, adding that there were ‘only 52 weekends in the year’. HSBC revealed yesterday it had been told to assign £218million to compensate thousands of personal loan customers after it omitted crucial information from their annual statements that would have shown they could overpay their loans without penalty. In doing so, it breached the Consumer Credit Act. It has been warned it faces a bill of almost £600million if other breaches are found. The bank also said it has been forced to set aside another £115million to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance, taking its total PPI bill to more than £2billion. Profits in the first half of the year fell 12 per cent to £7.3billion. But its shares nudged up 0.9 per cent to 635p last night. And MPs have shown little sympathy for Mr Flint’s complaints. Mark Garnier, a Tory on the Treasury Select Committee and former member of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, said: ‘When staff are nervous about selling more complicated products, I say thank God for that. If they are worried something is dodgy then we’ve got where we want to be.’ HSBC revealed it had been told to assign £218million to compensate thousands of personal loan customers after it omitted information from their statements showing they could overpay their loans without penalty . Labour’s John Mann, who also sits on the committee, said: ‘HSBC would feel less tired if they treated people decently and stopped ripping people off.’ HSBC was one of the few high street lenders to emerge from the financial crisis with its reputation largely intact. But it was fined £10.5million in 2011 after a subsidiary lured vulnerable customers into gambling their nest eggs. Its reputation was damaged further in 2012 when it was fined £1.2billion for breaching US money-laundering laws and described as being the ‘bank of choice’ for Mexican drug gangs.","A series of scandals has led to strict new regulations on consumer banking .

"By . Mark Duell . An unemployed chef won £2,500 after betting £5 on Germany to beat Brazil 7-1 in the World Cup. John Moore, 28, of Woodford, east London, claims he had a ‘premonition’ the day before Tuesday’s semi-final match and had ‘the numbers one and seven in my head’, before deciding to place the bet. The aspiring DJ and Arsenal fan claimed he had received signs such as the time on the clock being 17:17 and a package being delivered with ‘71’ on the slip - rather than his actual flat number. Winner: John Moore, 28, of Woodford, east London, claims he had a 'premonition' the day before Tuesday's semi-final match and had 'the numbers one and seven in my head', before deciding to place the bet . He said: ‘I had this premonition the day before and had the number one and seven in my head. There was a lot of signs, I remember looking at the clock and the time being 17:17. ‘[Also], we live in a block of flats and someone had put a note through the door saying we had a package to collect from the front desk - but they had put number 71 on the slip, not our flat number. ‘I like putting bets on big scores and this whole tournament I have been trying for 4-2s and 3-2s but I never thought the one I’d get would be Germany 7 - Brazil 1. ‘But when I saw the odds of 500-1 I thought “why not?”. I knew Brazil didn’t have Diego Costa and Neymar was out - I thought it was worth a punt. ‘And as an Arsenal fan I don’t rate David Luiz - and he was exposed in the game. (Chelsea manager José) Mourinho must be thinking he’s quids-in selling him for £50million.” Germany . swept aside Brazil in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday night to qualify for . Sunday's final against Argentina, and were astonishingly 5-0 up at . half-time - a scoreline they reached in just 29 minutes. Mr Moore even admitted cheering when Arsenal favourite Mesut Özil missed an eighth chance to keep the score only at seven in the second half of the match. And when Brazil snuck in a 90th-minute consolation goal, Mr Moore said he must have been the only person in the world in carnival mood. Huge win: Germany's Toni Kroos (left) celebrates after scoring his side's third goal during their 7-1 World Cup semi-final match against Brazil at the Mineirao Stadium in Belo Horizonte . Defeated: Brazil's Fernandinho, David Luiz and Maicon (from left) walk after Germany scored their fifth goal . Mr . Moore - who had the biggest win in Britain on a correct score bet for . the game - said he was planning on spending his winnings on a street . food business as well as buying some DJ equipment. A . Paddy Power spokesman said that three other people had correctly . predicted the score, adding: 'A 7-1 prediction was a long shot - but John definitely deserves to take a bow for that one now.' However, Mr Moore was not the biggest UK winner on the game, after Formula 1 heiress Tamara Ecclestone made a profit of £14,250 after betting £15,000 on Germany going through at 19/20. 'When I saw the odds of 500/1 I just thought, ""Why not?""' John Moore . According to the Daily Mirror, the delighted model, 30, later tweeted: ‘Think it's safe to say my investments for tonight are safe!’ In addition, online gambling website Betfair said three English gamblers had correctly predicted the 7-1 score and won a total of nearly £6,500 from only £6.50 of bets. But a spokesman said: ‘I feel sorry for the punters who had £31 at 999-1 on 7-0 Germany.’ Meanwhile, a student in Altrincham, Cheshire, staked 80p on Germany taking a 5-0 advantage into the break at odds of 300/1 and claimed £280 for their troubles. A William Hill spokesman said: '5-0 was such an improbable scoreline that someone probably placed the remaining 80p in their account in hope rather than expectation on the most unlikely of halftime scores, but that punter is now £280 better off.' Delighted: Formula 1 heiress Tamara Ecclestone made a profit of £14,250 after betting £15,000 on Germany going through at 19/20 . All wrong: Some 121,026 bets being placed with William Hill, but not one managed to predict the correct score . Despite 121,026 bets being placed with William Hill, not one managed to predict the correct score. The spokesman added: 'It’s the first time since 1999, when we introduced online betting, that not one William Hill punter has predicted the correct score in a football match.' 'I had this premonition the day before and had the numbers one and seven in my head - there were a lot of signs' John Moore . But some people got carried away in the middle of the game, with a Coral spokesman revealing one online punter placed a £2 bet on Germany winning 13-0, when they were 6-0 up, at odds of 300-1. Elsewhere, a Brazilian woman Anna Guerra, 44, won her office sweepstake after successfully predicting that Germany would thrash Brazil 7-1. The artist only came up with the idea of betting on that scoreline because her sleep-walking husband told to her to when she confronted him. 'He said Germany,' said Mrs Guerra. ‘I asked him what the score would be and he said ""7-1"".’ The woman scooped around 200 Brazilian real (£55) from her colleagues for her 10 real bet.","John Moore, 28, of Woodford, east London, says he had 'premonition'

"By . Mark Duell . Talented musician: Frances Andrade, 48, received psychiatric help only weeks before the trial . A concert violinist was urged by police not to seek counselling before she gave evidence in court against a choirmaster who sexually abused her as a teenager - in case it altered her memory, a coroner heard today. The inquest into the death of Frances Andrade - who died of an overdose - was told that the talented musician increasingly struggled to cope with depression and anxiety in the year ahead of the trial of ex-choirmaster Michael Brewer. Mrs Andrade died at her home in Guildford, Surrey, in January 2013, just a week after giving evidence in court about the historic sexual abuse, which came to light when her friend reported it to Surrey Police two years earlier. Known as Fran, she was aged just 14 and 15 at the time of the abuse. The mother-of-four had regular meetings with her GPs, who eventually referred her to the local health authority Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Trust’s Community Mental Health Recovery Service after she took multiple overdoses, Woking Coroner’s Court heard today. But two overdoses in October and December 2012 preceded the first meeting the 48-year-old had with a psychiatrist on December 19 of that year - just weeks before she would have to face her abuser at Manchester Crown Court. She had been in hospital at least four times for treatment following overdoses before health services regarded her as high risk. Her GP Mary Morrison, of St Luke’s Surgery, Guildford, said Mrs Andrade’s anxiety stemmed from the impending court appearance and they were both frustrated with delays in getting psychiatric help. Difficulties: Mrs Andrade (left) increasingly struggled to cope with depression and anxiety in the year ahead of the trial of ex-choirmaster Michael Brewer (right) ‘Four months before the trial, Fran wanted something pragmatic, something here and now that related more to the court case than her past experiences,’ Mrs Morrison said. ‘It was becoming more and more difficult for her as that approached. In our conversation on December 10 we were both frustrated. We could not understand what was taking so long - she needed help. ‘It had been five or six weeks since the referral and she still did not have a care co-ordinator - it was a month to the court case and it was important Fran had this therapy.’ 'She said [the] police didn’t not feel she should have counselling in case it interfered with her memories of the events and could obstruct the criminal case' Dr Alastair Bint . The inquest heard she again tried to take her own life on January 3, 2013. Dr Alastair Bint, also of St Luke’s, was Mrs Andrade’s GP in 2011 when she first reported anxiety over the abuse and said she took several overdoses after the press first reported the case in mid-2012. Dr Bint said: ‘I remember this consultation like it was yesterday because it was so unusual. Mrs Andrade came in and immediately burst into tears. History: Brewer taught at the prestigious Chetham's School of Music in Manchester (pictured) before going on to direct the World Youth Choir . ‘I remember sitting there for a couple of minutes in silence and let her cry and offered her tissues. Then she found the confidence to speak and told me what it was all about. Mrs Andrade allegedly said she felt as though she had been the one on trial during cross-examination by her abuser's counsel Kate Blackwell QC (above) ‘It was about the fact historical sexual abuse acts she had shut away for many years had been reopened. I remember her feeling helpless, she didn’t know what to do. ‘I remember it was not her choice. It had been reopened by a friend of hers who had reported it to the police and the police had contacted her. I remember her saying it not had been her choice to have this case reopened.’ He told the inquest he started seeing her fortnightly, adding: ‘I broached with her the offer of a psychiatric referral but she was resistant to that. ‘She said the reason why was the police didn’t not feel she should have counselling in case it interfered with her memories of the events and could obstruct the criminal case. ‘I felt her mental health was more important than the criminal case, but she was not persuaded.’ On Monday Mrs Andrade’s husband Levine Andrade, 59, said in his evidence that his wife told him she felt as though she had been the one on trial during cross-examination by her abuser’s counsel Kate Blackwell QC. Brewer, who taught at the prestigious Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester before going on to direct the World Youth Choir, was later stripped of his OBE for music services after being jailed for six years for five counts of indecent assault. In April, a serious case review by Surrey Safeguarding Adults Board said Mrs Andrade’s death ‘could and should’ have been prevented and mental health services failed to recognise she was vulnerable as she made repeated suicide bids. Her death led to calls for the court system to improve how sexual abuse victims are treated. The inquest is scheduled to run into next week.","Frances Andrade, 48, struggled to cope with depression and anxiety .

"By . Mark Duell . A drunk thug killed a charity worker with a pair of scissors just three weeks after being freed early from prison for beating another man with a baseball bat, a court heard yesterday. Shaun Lacey, 40, of Leek, Staffordshire, had a 23-year history of violence - but was granted parole after serving half of a three-year jail term for battering a man at random. Just 21 days after his early release from jail, Lacey became drunk and stabbed his mother’s neighbour Damien Fyson, 37, in the chest with a pair of kitchen scissors as the victim lay asleep. Manslaughter: Shaun Lacey (left), 40, of Leek, Staffordshire, stabbed his mother's neighbour Damien Fyson (right), 37, in the chest with a pair of kitchen scissors as the victim lay asleep . Before fleeing the scene, Lacey told a horrified onlooker: ‘I’ve stabbed him in the heart, you better get an ambulance.’ Mr Fyson, who used to a work for an organisation which handed out donated furniture to the poor and needy, suffered fatal injuries and bled to death at the scene. Lacey - who has 18 previous convictions for violence dating back more than 20 years - was jailed for 17 and a half years after admitting manslaughter. Two years ago he was branded a ‘violent bully who uses violence as an acceptable means of dealing with minor irritations’ by a judge. But despite his record, Lacey was released on December 18, 2013 after serving only 18 months. The killing occurred on January 8 this . year after Lacey went to his mother’s home in Hanley, near . Stoke-on-Trent, to help get her back into her flat after she was locked . out. Weapon: The scissors that were used in the attack on Mr Fyson, who suffered fatal injuries and bled to death . Investigation: A police officer at the scene of the murder of Mr Fyson in Hanley, near Stoke-on-Trent . Birmingham Crown Court was told he had . been drinking all day and encountered Mr Fyson who lived next door with a . woman called Tina Brown. Shaun Lacey had 18 previous convictions for violence dating back to 1991 when he was arrested for causing actual bodily harm. In 1994 and 1996 he was convicted of wounding and common assault, for which he was jailed for one month. In . 1997, Lacey was handed six months imprisonment for common assault but . went on to commit another common assault in 2002. In 2004, he was jailed . for battery for 18 months. Four . years later, in 2008, Lacey committed three further offences of . assault, and in 2009, he was arrested for threatening behaviour, and two . counts of assault, including an attack on a policeman. In . 2011, he was convicted of assaulting a pub landlord and assaulting his . ex-partner - who was 40 weeks pregnant at the time - before he hit . neighbour Gavin Ball over the head with a baseball bat. In July 2012 he was jailed for three years. The pair invited Lacey into their flat and the group shared drinks but tragedy struck at 5am when Miss Brown, who had fallen asleep, woke up to see Lacey stood up in front of her holding a pair of scissors and saying he had stabbed Mr Fyson. She called paramedics but they were unable to save the victim. Prosecutor Gareth Evans QC said: ‘The defendant has a lengthy record for unprovoked violence. His convictions can range from young people, women, old friends - he doesn’t discriminate over who his victims are. ‘He was on prison licence and within a matter of days he was killing someone. His violence is escalating. He uses his fists and his teeth to harm people. ‘He has used a baseball bat to hit someone over the head and now he has used a pair of scissors. He had been at liberty a matter of weeks when this incident occurred.’ Lacey claimed he was not looking for trouble. But the judge Mr Justice Stephen Phillips told him: ‘This was an appalling act of mindless violence fuelled by incessant drinking. ‘There’s no doubt you knew what you had done because you told someone to call an ambulance and left the flat. The tragic result of your actions was the loss of Damien’s life. Mr Fyson’s mother and sister have been left devastated by their loss.’ Scene: A woman called Tina Brown, who had fallen asleep, woke up to see Lacey stood up in front of her holding a pair of scissors and saying he had stabbed Mr Fyson . Forensics on location: Lacey was jailed for 17 and a half years after admitting manslaughter in court . After the case Detective Inspector Dave Johnston, of Staffordshire Police, who led the inquiry, said: ‘Our investigation to establish the facts of this tragic incident was difficult due to the fact those involved had been drinking heavily. ‘However, by piecing together the detailed forensic evidence from the scene and the evidence given by witnesses, we were able to confirm that Lacey had been responsible for Damien’s death. 'This was an appalling act of mindless violence fuelled by incessant drinking' Mr Justice Stephen Phillips . ‘It was noted by the judge that his actions had no apparent motive and were simply fuelled by excessive alcohol. ‘We welcome today’s guilty plea and I hope that this conclusion brings some form of comfort to Damien’s family. ‘Although Lacey’s admission to manslaughter will not bring Damien back, his family now at least have the knowledge that his killer is facing justice and will be spending considerable time behind bars.’ Mr Fyson’s mother, Cherie Jackson, said: ‘No sentence can bring Damien back to us, however, we would like to thank the judge and prosecution for seeing Lacey for what he is, a cruel and heartless killer, and passing such a long sentence.’","Shaun Lacey, 40, of Leek, Staffordshire, had a 23-year history of violence .

'He was a wonderful child, a wonderful husband, a wonderful father,' his mother, Sirli Soldo, told the newspaper.

Alan Howarth, 68, planted £200 in cash and rigged up a hidden camera when money started going missing from his mother Elizabeth’s home in Tyldesley, Greater Manchester. Days later Ivy Peachey, 63, was filmed taking some of the money and stuffing it into her pinafore as she cleaned the house. She has since admitted theft of £140 and been jailed for one month.

Caught on camera: Ivy Peachey, 63, was filmed taking cash (circled) and stuffing it into her pinafore as she cleaned Elizabeth Howarth's house in Tyldesley, Greater Manchester . Concerns: Alan Howarth (left), 68, planted £200 in cash and rigged up a hidden camera when money started going missing from the home of his mother Elizabeth (right) However, the family claim an estimated £30,000 of Mrs . Howarth’s savings remains unaccounted for - an allegation which the Crown Prosecution Service has investigated but found no evidence to support. After . the case, Mr Howarth said: ‘I’m just very happy that it she has been found guilty. My mum was absolutely devastated when . she found out the truth. ‘She . regarded Ivy as a close personal friend. She’s okay now but it has . really taken its toll on her. At first she wouldn’t believe it was Ivy . who had taken the money. It took a lot of convincing. ‘Even . I couldn’t believe it. My mum finds it hard to trust now and she will . definitely not be employing anybody else to help with her cleaning. The . family does it between us now.’ Peachey had been visiting Mrs Howarth’s home for nine years, and cleaned once a fortnight. Mr Howarth then planted £200 for a first time. Trusted cleaner: Peachey (right), 68, had been visiting the home of Mrs Howarth (left), 99, for nine years . Shortly after the cleaner’s visit, Mr Howarth noticed £160 had vanished. He then contacted police who suggested doing the same thing, but planting a camera to catch the culprit in the act. Mr Howarth said: ‘I decided to plant some money in a little box and monitor it. So after going to the police I did the same thing again and placed a hidden camera there and saw Ivy take money from the box and put it in her pinny. 'I’m just very happy that it has all come out and she has been found guilty. My mum was absolutely devastated when she found out the truth' Alan Howarth, son . ‘I even took a note of the serial numbers on the cash and when the police searched her house they found the notes.’ Prosecutors said there was no evidence that Peachey had any access to the pensioner’s bank cards or pin numbers. Sentencing Peachey yesterday after she . admitted theft following the incident last year, magistrates told the . thief that she had shown no remorse throughout the year-long . investigation. 'Couldn't believe it': Elizabeth Howarth (left) was 'absolutely devastated when she found out the truth' about the thefts by Peachey (right), who has since been jailed for a month and ordered to pay costs of £800 .

'My mum finds it hard to trust now and she will definitely not be employing anybody else to help with her cleaning. The family does it between us now' Alan Howarth, son . The CPS said: ‘There was no evidence to establish that Ivy Peachey ever had access to the victim’s bank account. 'Therefore there was insufficient evidence to provide a realist prospect of conviction in relation to the allegation of theft of £30,000.’ However, Mr Howarth added: ‘I’m just happy that she has been proven to be a thief and I hope that others who have been victim to her get some satisfaction.’ MailOnline has contacted Peachey's solicitor regarding the case.","Alan Howarth, 68, planted £200 in cash and rigged up a hidden camera .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Lying deep in the rolling Devon countryside, this house is a long way from the nearest pub. But that won't be a problem for whoever buys it, because Brick House in Mamhead, near Exeter, which is for sale for £1.15million, comes with its very own vineyard. Drinks will be on the new owner of the four-bedroom Grade II* listed country house, which boasts a 3.5 acre plantation of vines and currently produces about 4,000 bottles a year. Brick House, which is for sale for £1.15million, lies in a secluded valley near Exeter, Devon, and boasts 3.5 acres of vineyards which produce 4,000 bottles of wine a year . The vines were planted with Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir grapes in 2006 by owners Gary Bullard and Elaine Sullivan, who bought the house the previous year . House with a history: The four-bedroom house dates back to the 18th century and is featured in a book from the 1780s called Travels In Georgian Devon . The unusual-looking property, which could be extended, is believed to have been named Brick House because it was rare to build a house out of bricks at the time . Owners Gary Bullard and Elaine Sullivan, who bought the property in 2005 and planted the vineyard of Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir grapes a year later, produce white and rose wine, which they sell to friends, family and local restaurants. First mentioned in a book named Travels In Georgian Devon, which was published in the 1780s, the brick-built house was a rarity in its day, hence the name. As well as the vineyards, it comes with paddocks, barns, gardens and woodlands totalling 20 acres, and lies in a private valley with far-reaching rural views. Mr Bullard, a company director from Richmond, Surrey, said he and his partner were selling their second home to move closer to his in-laws in Dorset. He said: 'I'm a wine enthusiast and collector, and when I lived in France I used to travel around the vineyards. 'We bought land around the house and we decided it would be fantastic to look over your own vineyard.  We had a specialist come and look at the soil and advise us on what grapes to go with, but we decided on Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir. Rural solitude: The house lies deep in the tranquil Devon countryside, but getting a drink won't be a problem given the vineyards included in the price tag . It is currently used as a second home by wine enthusiasts Gary Bullard and Elaine Sullivan, whose main home is in Richmond, Surrey, but they want to buy in Dorset . Nice spot for a glass of wine: The property comes with paddocks, woodlands, gardens, a pond and a stream, as well as its own vineyards, so peace is guaranteed . Vines: Brick House's owner, Mr Bullard, said he took advice on which grapes to plant after he bought the property in 2005, and chose to go for 'quantity over quality' Beamed dining room: With endless rural views and a (practically) endless supply of wine, Brick House would make a good place for a party . Country living: The estate agent selling the house, Savills' Richard Addington, said: 'This house is in the most lovely position and is a proper, miniature country estate' 'These grapes aren't grown much in the UK, and they ripen quite late in the year, but we wanted to go for quality over quantity.' The property, which also has its own stream, pond, and a stone barn used as a workshop and games room, is being sold by estate agents Savills. Savills' Richard Addington said: 'This house is in the most lovely position and is surrounded by farmland.  It has four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and the owners also have planning permission to join the barn and the house together. 'It's a proper miniature country estate.' Bottoms up! The vineyard is planted with grapes which can produce white white - Sauvignon Blanc - or red wine in the form of Pinot Noir .","Brick House in Mamhead, near Exeter, which lies amongst 20 acres of beautiful Devon countryside, is for sale .

Twelve months ago she became the first British woman to reach the last 16 at SW19 in 15 years. A longstanding wrist injury disappointingly denies the popular 20-year-old her place in the competition this time round, however, with Heather Watson and Johanna Konta among the British women left to fly the flag. Sidelined: Laura Robson will miss the Championships at Wimbledon this year with a wrist injury . But the former British No 1, who will be a part of the BBC's commentary team this year, should be encouraged by one statistic, at least: the average age of a Grand Slam champion is 24. According to new research by Virgin Active, future Grand Slam champions will hit the ball a staggering 2.4million times by the time they reach the golden age of 24; equivalent to 100,000 strokes-a-year. The study also suggests that top players would have spent three years of their life on the courts at the same age, covering 2,496 miles and burning more than 936,000 calories - which equates to the large number of 3,505 bowls of strawberries and cream for armchair fans. Robson is an ambassador for the new ‘Active Aces’ programme and was pictured covered in tennis balls to launch the initiative that is aimed to inspire the next generation of budding British talent. On the red carpet: Robson attended the WTA pre-Wimbledon party at Kensington Roof Gardens on Thursday . 'That a professional player has spent three years of their life on court by the time they are 24 shows how much dedication is needed to become a world-class player,' said Great Britain's Davis Cup captain Leon Smith. 'It also shows that it’s important for children to start playing the sport young.' Indeed, Robson will be keen to make up the numbers when she returns to full fitness soon with next year's Australian Open her likely Grand Slam comeback date. Selfie time: Robson (top 2nd right) joined a number of tennis stars at the Rally For Bally match at Queen's . 'I don't actually know my recovery timescale,' said the British No 2, speaking last week.

He told the young fans: 'I'd love to have a run outfield... but I'm not quite as fit as the others are. 'I could have a five minute burst and cause a bit of . trouble!' The last time City tried that, David James failed to create any impact when Stuart Pearce threw the towering goalkeeper up front with minutes to go in their end of season 1-1 draw against Middlesbrough in 2005, where they narrowly missed out on Europe as a result. But perhaps we might see a late cameo from Hart this Sunday if the Capital . One Cup Final delivers a dramatic climax...

"By . Associated Press . A onetime clinic owner accused of providing steroids to Alexander Rodriguez and other major league players has been charged in 'a drug conspiracy,' said police on Tuesday. Drug Enforcement Administration spokeswoman Mia Ro said  former Biogenesis of America clinic owner Anthony Bosch, who was charged Tuesday with conspiracy to distribute steroids was among nine people arrested. The documents do not specify whether the charges are directly related to the Major League Baseball scandal. Arrested: Anthony Bosch is accused of participating in a 'drug conspiracy' He confessed: A-Rod admitted he used steroids while with Texas from 2000 to 2003, saying former clinic owner Yuri Sucart obtained and injected the drugs for him . Also arrested was former clinic owner Yuri Sucart. It was not immediately clear what Sucart had been charged with. Sucart, 52, was banned from the Yankees clubhouse, charter flights, bus and other team-related activities by Major League Baseball in 2009 after Rodriguez admitted he used steroids while with Texas from 2000 to 2003, saying Sucart obtained and injected the drugs for him.Court documents say that from October 2008 through December 2012, Bosch willfully conspired to distribute the anabolic steroid testosterone. Bosch surrendered Tuesday morning, and eight other people also have been arrested, including Sucart, Ro said. Among the others charged were Carlos Javier Acevedo, 35, of Miami; Jorge Augustine Velazquez, 43, of Miami; Christopher Benjamin Engroba, 25, of Miami; Lazaro Daniel Collazo, 50, of Hialeah; and Juan Carlos Nuñez, 48, of Fort Lauderdale. Collazo is a former pitching coach for the universities of Miami, Louisville and South Florida who has also worked as a private instructor with numerous high school, college and professional pitchers. His University of Miami biography says he worked with Hall of Fame pitcher Jim Palmer during his 1991 comeback attempt, seven years after Palmer's retirement. A Miami New Times report from January 2013, which sparked MLB's investigation, said Rodriguez had bought human growth hormone and other substances from 2009 to 2012 from Bosch's clinic, Biogenesis of America. The newspaper said it had obtained records detailing the purchases by Rodriguez and other ballplayers. Trouble:Anthony Bosch is shown being escorted into a car, next to a  Drug Enforcement Administration official today . Possible distributor:  Police arrested Anthony Bosch who was charged on Tuesday with conspiracy to distribute steroids . Fourteen players associated with the Coral Gables clinic were disciplined last year by MLB, including a season-long 2014 suspension imposed on Rodriguez. MLB had sued Bosch and his clinic but withdrew the lawsuit in February. The lawsuit had accused them of conspiring with players to violate their contracts by providing them with banned substances. Although the lawsuit sought unspecified damages, it also provided a way for MLB to subpoena clinic records. Rodriguez, who denied using banned substances while playing for the New York Yankees, initially fought the suspension. He finally ended his fight with MLB in February, accepting the suspension and withdrawing a pair of lawsuits against the MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association. Rodriguez's suspension is the longest penalty in the sport's history related to performance-enhancing drugs. He was the only player involved in the scandal to contest his penalty. By the time Biogenesis closed its doors in a beige, nondescript office park across the street from the University of Miami, its neighbors had been warned to alert authorities if they saw Bosch. Employees in neighboring businesses said they received a flier in January 2013 with Bosch's picture, stating that he wasn't a doctor and was no longer allowed on the property. Suspended: Rodriguez's suspension is the longest penalty in the sport's history related to performance-enhancing drugs. He was the only player involved in the scandal to contest his penalty . Other people who worked in the building have said they never recognized any of the people entering or leaving the clinic, but they took note of the flashy cars they parked out front — Mercedes, Range Rovers and Bentleys. The New Times report said it had obtained notes by Bosch listing player names and the substance they received. Several unidentified employees and clients confirmed to the publication that the clinic distributed the substances, and they said that Bosch bragged of supplying drugs to professional athletes, but they never saw the sports stars in the office.At the time, Bosch's attorney said the reports were inaccurate and filled with 'misstatements of fact.'","Former Biogenesis of .

"By . Rob Draper . Follow @@draper_rob . As ever it was Diego Maradona who expressed the mood of the Argentinian public best after the semi-final win against Holland, even if it involved an inevitable degree of self-aggrandisement. ‘They laughed when my first words as Argentina coach were: “Give me Mascherano and 10 others”,’ said Maradona. ‘But no one is laughing any more.’ And even if almost everything else Maradona pronounced on as national team coach of Argentina four years ago was wrong, that much was right. Even in the country of Lionel Messi, the man who once upon a time could not even make West Ham’s first team is rightly being acknowledged as one of the world’s finest holding midfielders. Challenge of the World Cup: Javier Mascherano denies Arjen Robben . Top block: Mascherao has been an influential cog as Argentina chase a third World Cup win . The sliding tackle to block Arjen Robben’s shot, which saved Argentina against Holland, will never be forgotten, not simply because of the skill and tenacity with which it was executed but also because of the excruciating post-match quote from Mascherano. ‘Sorry for being gross but I tore my anus doing that,’ he said. Given that he has spent much of the past two years filling in at centre-half at Barcelona, and at times being exposed, many might have forgotten just how good Mascherano was at Liverpool when directing a game from the base of midfield. At this tournament there has been a reminder and Wednesday’s performance has brought an  outpouring of praise in his homeland, where he has been portrayed as a cross between Rambo, a  latter-day Che Guevara — the ‘Che’ in his name making it an easy pun — and the 19th century liberator of South America, Jose de San Martin. For Mascherano, very much a footballer’s footballer rather than a galactico, it has all become a bit much. ‘I’m not Rambo nor am I San Martin,’ he said. ‘I don’t take anything that is being said seriously. I can see the humourous side of it all but I’m embarrassed. And that’s not false modesty because false modesty is worse than pride. A leader of men: Mascherano talks to his team-mates before extra-time in the Holland game . Snarling: Mascherano talks to Lionel Messi at half-time of the Holland game . ‘The . hero worship is too much as people begin to have expectations that . perhaps you can’t meet. That’s what’s been going on the past few days. People think that you can do things that in  reality you can’t. I’m . grateful for the praise of the people but honestly I don’t really like . it. It makes me uneasy.’ That said, where once it was assumed Messi would lead this team — and in a manner of speaking he does and is still the most influential figure on the pitch — it is both Mascherano and Messi who were delivering the team talks before extra-time and penalties in the huddle of Argentina players. It appears there is a symbiotic relationship between the two, one a natural leader by virtue of his intelligence and personal qualities, the other a leader because of his sheer ability. ‘We’re satisfied and calm about the job we’ve done,’ said Mascherano. ‘Now we have to make a pact as a team to reach the next level. Mixed emotions: Mascherano and Ezequiel Garay embrace after seeing off Holland on penalties . Glee: Argentina celebrate Maxi Rodriguez's winning penalty . ‘I still can’t believe we’re playing the final game at Maracana. I’m really happy to part of this group. It was a very intelligent tactical display against Holland but it doesn’t end there. We are about to play the most important game of our lives.’ As for Maradona’s assessment of the team of Mascherano and 10 others, he is predictably dismissive. ‘It’s neither Mascherano, nor Messi,’ he said. ‘It’s all of us together. We’re proud of being a really good group, without egos and all aiming for the same thing.’","Mascherano is rightly being acknowledged as one of the world’s finest holding midfielders .

"By . Matt Lawless . Follow @@mattylawless . For Tony Jacklin, becoming the first British winner of the US Open in 46 years was just one of the great outcomes from his stunning seven-shot success back in 1970. The second was the friendship that blossomed with the man who presided over his bag for those four golden days at Hazeltine Golf Club. ‘One of the sweetest things of it all was the $3,000 that I gave my caddie, Tom Murphy’, said Jacklin. Backing: Golf legend Tony Jacklin has backed Justin Rose to defend his US Open title . Victor: Rose won his first major at Merion last year . Throwback: He was the first Englishman to do so since Jacklin himself in 1970 . ‘Yes, I did leave my cheque in my trousers and it went off to the dry cleaners. ‘But they sent me a new one and I gave Tom 10 per cent of my $30,000 winnings. It put him through college. ‘He was 19 at the time. He went on to become a multi-millionaire who owned golf courses and sports bars and all sorts. And even at 63, he remembered every shot I hit. ‘So, apart from winning the US Open, the nicest thing is that Tom made a fantastic success of his life too.’ Sadly, Murphy passed away during his sleep at his American home at the end of last month. This year’s edition at Pinehurst will no doubt prove an emotional time for legend Jacklin, Europe’s most-celebrated European Ryder Cup captain of all-time, with reminders of his sensational triumph and the man who was there alongside him. ‘He’ll be missed by a lot of people,’ the 1969 Open champion recently told Reuters in a telephone interview, just two weeks after speaking exclusively to Sportsmail at the OnlineGolf.co.uk golf day at Thorndon Park in Essex. ‘Tom touched a lot of lives and was a sweetheart of a guy.’ Hordes: Jacklin is mobbed by fans after victory over the USA in the Ryder Cup at Muirfield Village, Ohio, USA, in 1987. Having won two majors and three Ryder Cups, Jacklin is royalty in British golfing terms. And he was delighted to see Justin Rose end a long, 43-year wait and add his name to the coveted list of winners when he triumphed so spectacularly at Merion 12 months ago. ‘I was thrilled for Justin. I contacted him immediately. I know the feeling and it had been a long time (since an English player won it). ‘It was a long time before I won it and a long time after, so it was really great. He’s a great guy and I was delighted for him. He held it together beautifully.’ So does Jacklin believe Rose, 33, will go one better than he managed and successfully defend his title come Sunday evening? ‘It’s a tough championship to defend,’ he said. ‘There’s expectation and everyone’s monitoring how you’re doing. There’s  a lot of pressure going into it. ‘And a lot of it is down to whether the course suits you. ‘I defended at Merion where Justin won his, ironically. Unfortunately, I didn’t do a very good job of it. The course was very narrow and I never got to grips with the way to play it really. ‘But in Justin’s case, he has established himself as a world star now in the top 10 and playing steady golf, so there’s no reason why he can’t do a good job this year. ‘It’s a tall order. People wonder why there was a such a gap from when I won it to Justin’s success last year. And he certainly has a chance.’ Pointer: Rose points to the sky after his final putt of the US Open last year . Silhouette: Rose raises his proudly deserved trophy to the sky . Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell will be among the British contingent hoping to stake their claim in North Carolina this week. The Northern Irishmen took the honours in 2011 and, the latter, a year beforehand in 2010. But Jacklin, who led from start to finish when he celebrated glory in Minnesota over four decades ago, believes the opening round will be the key to the eventual winner on a tough Pinehurst track. ‘Who knows who will win it?’ said the 69-year-old, who now resides in Florida. ‘All of these predications we try to make is a lot of hot air. Until you get through the first round, a lot of people underestimate the importance of it. You can’t win it after the first round but you can lose it. ‘More important for the great players, if they get a good first round on the board, If they are in the first three, they get mentally engaged and they know that they are of that pedigree that they can win. ‘Sometimes though we tend to forget that, at this level, it’s a mind game. Purely, and simply. Without Tiger Woods, who remains sidelined by a back injury to miss his second major tournament of the year after his absence at Augusta, Jacklin believes there is a real opportunity for the rest of the field. ‘There will be some shocks,’ he said. ‘There always is. Surprise characters crop up in majors and sometimes they can take the lead early on. ‘Everyone wants Tiger to get better. He’ll be missed by the fans. There’s no question over his impact on the game over the last 15 years or so. But he’s still just one player. Contender: Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy is one of the favourites in the field going into the tournament . Knocking about: As is fellow countryman Graeme McDowell, who will be hoping to repeat his win of 2010 . Whoever does go on to emulate his US Open feat, Jacklin insists they will face the most stringent of examinations from what is arguably the most difficult major to land. ‘I honestly think the US Open is the supreme test,’ he said. ‘It’s the supreme examination because it allows the USGA to set the course up on the edge. ‘At The Open you can’t do much - weather-wise you’ve got to keep the greens and pin placements reasonable. But at the US Open they can take it to the limit with pin positions and green speeds. So, it’s not just a test of golf, it’s a test of patience and a lot of things. ‘There’ll be guys this year who will hit shots at Pinehurst that deserve birdies. But they might come off with bogeys or worse sometimes. It’s swallowing that and moving on that the US Open is as much about than anything. ‘It’s no good going in thinking, “That’s not fair”. It’s just how it is. So, whoever comes out winning will have dealt with all the necessary obstacles. ‘Pinehurst with the false fronts, lots of undulation and pin placement that goads guys into going for them. The ball can run off and you might end up 40 yards away after hitting what appeared to be a good ball. ‘Of course, winning The Open was the one I always wanted to win because it’s my home country’s major and it is the oldest. But there’s no doubt in my mind that the US Open is the hardest. They take it to courses that they can set on the edge. They like to watch the guys suffer!’ Tony Jacklin CBE was a special guest at the OnlineGolf.co.uk Golf Day, authorised retailer of all major golf brands including TaylorMade and Lyle & Scott .","Rose ended 43-year wait for English winner at Merion last year .

While the rest of the world is allowing itself to be overwhelmed by the consistency of the German national team reaching their fourth consecutive World Cup semi-final, the feeling in Germany is somewhat different.

In the last few years we have come close in tournaments but now we want to win it. 'We want to go to the final and win the title; that was our goal from the beginning. It is going to be tough. But it doesn’t matter who we play, we look at ourselves and how we play.’ Per Mertesacker, the Arsenal centre-half who endured the disappointment of being dropped before the game, has expressed the same thought. Triumph: Hummels celebrates beating scoring the quarter-final's only goal to put Germany through . All together: The team spirit within the German squad has developed as this team has grown up together . ‘We finished the last two World Cups in third position and that is really consistent,’ said Mertesacker. ‘What we need in Germany after all these years is a title. We are talking about titles and trophies.’ Indeed. Before the game against France in the Maracana, Germany manager Joachim Low hung up a signed Germany shirt from the 1954 team in the dressing room. On Friday, as they prepared to take on France, Low wanted to remind his players that it was 60 years to the day that Germany had won their first World Cup, which at the time was a shock performance dubbed the ‘Miracle of Bern’ but which laid the foundations of the post-War successes of German football. Since then there have been World Cup wins in 1974 and 1990, along with European Championship triumphs in 1972, 1980 and 1996. Joy: Mertesacker, Schweinsteiger and Neuer celebrate beating France to reach a fourth consecutive semi-final . Expectation: 18 years is a long time without a trophy for a team that always reaches the semi-finals . But while an 18-year gap between trophies would be nothing to worry about in England, for Germany it is beginning to nag. ‘It’s quite a performance it you are constantly in the semi-final,’ said Low on Friday night. But he was aware of the subtext of the questioning and added: ‘And yes, we will try to make the next step.’ This is the German generation that came of age in 2009, winning in the European Under-21 championships in Sweden against England. In the final that night in Malmo their team included Manuel Neuer, Benedikt Howedes, Mats Hummels, Sami Khedira and Mesut Ozil, all of whom started against France and who represent the heart of Germany now. The England team, beaten comprehensively 4-0 that night, included only Theo Walcott and James Milner who now feature for England, though Joe Hart would have played had he not been suspended for the final. VIDEO Klopp analyses Germany's chances . Superb: Neuer's strng save in the final moments against France has earned him plenty of praise . It was Neuer and Hummels who took the plaudits in the Maracana. Neuer is so good ‘he could play in midfield for Germany’ said Low, referring to the ‘sweeper-keeper’ style of the German No 1. His ability to pass with his feet allows him to come well out of his box to clear up long balls, which permits the German back four to push up high. ‘He is the best in the world,’ said his Bayern team-mate Jerome Boateng. His last-minute save, pushing away Karim Benzema’s strike, was almost nonchalant, a throwback to Oliver Kahn and Peter Schmeichel, goalkeepers schooled in handball who had that ability to stand tall and simply punch balls away. ‘I try to copy the style of a handball goalkeeper when a forward is one on one,’ said Neuer, who played the game at school. There was some respite for Germany in the euphoria of the quarter-final win. Until now, Low and his team have endured criticism in Germany for the style of their football against Ghana and the unconvincing manner of their win against Algeria. Golden generation: Neuer has progressed through from the U21 squad with many in this team . ‘If other teams won the World Cup this way they would be seen as clever,’ said Thomas Muller. ‘People would rave about them. 'I don’t want to end up winning the World Cup and find that we have to be apologising for it, saying: “Sorry we only won the final 1-0.”’ Muller need not worry. The mood has eased somewhat after victory against France and Germany seem to be evolving into something impressive here. The hosts will be without Neymar and Thiago Silva for Tuesday’s semi-final in Belo Horizonte and it now looks, with their creative spark gone, that only sheer willpower and determination will get Brazil over the line to the final.

The disgraced Uruguay star had claimed in a letter to FIFA that in no event did he bite or ‘try to bite’ Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during Tuesday’s World Cup clash in Natal. But members of the disciplinary committee were infuriated by  Suarez’s pathetic mitigation and threw the book at him, banning him from all football for four months as well as nine international games.

Uruguay went on to beat Italy 1-0 and qualify for the last 16 and set up last night’s clash with Colombia. Suarez’s claim of innocence was a huge misjudgment.

"By . Rob Draper . Follow @@draper_rob . Managers have a habit of talking up the opposition, especially after they have won. It’s not a particularly subtle way of amplifying your own team’s qualities. Clearly if the side you have beaten are excellent, then that only magnifies your own achievement. So when Cesare Prandelli praised England at the end his 2-1 win over them on Sunday night, the warm words had to be filtered through a more cynical prism. And yet, even given that proviso, it is worth recording what he said. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Neil Ashton's verdict on England v Italy . Rising star: Raheem Sterlng provided huge encouragement for England in their World Cup opener . Raising their game: Roy Hodgson has brought a better brand of football to the England team . ‘We know England have changed a lot in the last few years,’ said Prandelli. ‘They used to play with long balls and headers. Now England are very good playing in triangles and one on one. They really have one the strongest attacks in the World Cup. 'I’ve been really consistent in what I’ve been saying: we played against a great team.’ Perhaps he was ladling it on a little by the end. England are not a great side but they do have the potential to be a good one. It is Prandelli’s line about England playing in triangles that perhaps offers the most encouragement. It wasn’t just about the speed of England on Saturday night, which, should they progress, will surely worry any side they face. They actually moved the ball nicely at times, engineering their way out of tight spaces with neat passing. It’s not the first time England have done it. Foreign coaches once were similarly complementary about the improvements that Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle had made to England’s style but progressive football was somehow abandoned once the expensive foreign imports took over the reins of management. High praise: Italy manager Cesare Prandelli was full of praise for Hodgson's new-look team . Passing game: Both Venables in Euro 96 (left) and Hoddle at France 98 (right) tried to improve England's style . It seems it takes an English coach to believe English players can actually play a little: Sven Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello never seemed to trust them to do so. Too often at World Cups England have been like the unwanted drunken guest, stumbling over tables and embarrassing everyone with their inappropriate aggression. On Saturday, in a World Cup that has sparkled so far, England behaved like part of the in-crowd at the party, entertaining and impressing. True, they lost, a not inconsiderable draw back. But most would take defeat in this manner over the 0-0 abject draw with Algeria in Cape Town in 2010; or the laboured victories over Paraguay and Trinidad and Tobago in 2006. Who would have known that Roy Hodgson had been repressing these attacking instincts? Like a suburban bank manager who indulges a secret passion for clubbing at the weekends, he indulged every populist call in deploying Raheem Sterling from the start, refusing to kowtow to Wayne Rooney and in bringing on Ross Barkley. A few Liverpool fans might be bemused by the manager England have employed. He would argue that he didn’t have these players at Liverpool. Back then: England played brilliant football at Euro 96 but reverted to a long-ball game with foreign coaches . Pride: Even in defeat England played well and will progress if they perform to that level in the next two games . Yet on Saturday night, England seemed to play with freedom, as though they embracing the challenge rather enduring it. Not that the game was without issues. Ultimately England’s failure to pick up Claudio Marchisio for Italy’s first goal was inexplicable in a team managed by Hodgson, who is so meticulous on his team shape and player responsibilities. Good though Andrea Pirlo’s dummy was, Marchisio had a free strike. It was a goal that was easily prevented. And Leighton Baines won’t relish the re-runs of Antonio Candreva turning him the wrong way to deliver the deep, looping cross for Mario Balotelli to score. And then there is Rooney. Roy Hodgson defended him on Saturday night and it is true that for long periods he performed in his required role as well as delivering a superb cross for Daniel Sturridge’s goal. ‘We wanted to get Raheem Sterling around Andrea Pirlo because of his agility and of course that meat moving Wayne Rooney and I thought that worked well,’ said Hodgson. ‘He set up the goal for us, he worked very hard and did well also when we brought him back into the centre. 'There’s always going to be one player who there’s a big debate around but I think it’s very harsh to criticise Rooney’s performance today because for me he played well.’ Passing success: Hodgson's decision to get England playing a more dynamic game will produce results . Down but not out: Rooney was disappointing but he offers enough to be picked against Uruguay . That said, Sturridge, Welbeck and Sterling played better. The debate for Uruguay now boils down to whether Rooney is better than Adam Lallana? As an attacking threat he is and as such he starts in a game England must win. However, it might be argued that Lallana would have have dealt with full back Matteo Darmian better and would have had the energy to offer greater protection to Baines. Significantly, Hodgson felt the need to switch Welbeck to the left at half time, to curtail the Italian right back – though he still popped up providing the pass for Candreva’s cross and Balotelli’s goal. And then there is the small matter of defeat. Under Eriksson and Capello England often looked awful; but they didn’t lose in World Cup group stages, though Eriksson did in his first game in Euro 2004 to France. England could be figuratively packing their bags on Thursday, slipping out of the party before the real dancing begins, returning home after briefly dazzling. It doesn’t feel like that, however. Not since 1998 and the honourable exit against Argentina on penalties has defeat felt this good. The national mood won’t feel quite so generous if the result is the same on Thursday; but if the performance is repeated, there is little chance that it will be.","Cesare Prandelli's praise shows England are on the right track .

"By . Rob Draper . Follow @@draper_rob . There are few more respected voices in world football than Pep Guardiola. The Bayern Munich coach does not defer to many in the game, such is the cult following he had grown since turning to management and winning two Champions League titles, four league titles, three domestic cups in his first five seasons in his new career. Only one man seemingly has the capacity to make him appear subordinate. ‘I was lucky enough to enjoy (Lionel) Messi at Barcelona,’ said Guardiola, the former Nou Camp coach, said last week. Embrace: Messi runs over to hug Guardiola after scoring in the Spaniard's last game in charge at Barca . Former colleagues: Guardiola, now Bayern boss, has been in Brazil watching Messi at the World Cup . ‘Competitively he’s on a level way above my understanding. A player like him is born once a lifetime. He always takes the right decisions and I would have been too embarrassed to try to tell him where and how to play.’ The watching world would doubtless endorse his words. There have been hat-tricks against Real Madrid, an impossible goal against Getafe mimicking Diego Maradona, and that extraordinary Champions League final at Wembley in 2011 where he simply swept aside the best efforts that Manchester United could muster. And those are just a handful of his highlights. Smiling assassin: Messi trains with his Argentina team-mates in Brasilia on Friday . Date with destiny: Argentina know they are just three games away from their first World Cup trophy since 1986 . Star: Messi has lit up La Liga for Barcelona, scoring hundreds of goals for the Catalan giants . Match-winner: Messi celebrates wildly after scoring in the 2011 Champions League final against United . And yet greats from yesteryear such as Pele, Johan Cruyff and Maradona made their names at the World Cup. So far it has been different for Messi. In 2006 he was too young to make an impact. In 2010 he departed Cape Town in tears, with Argentina dismantled by a vibrant young German team. The following year at the Copa America in Argentina the relationship between Messi and his home nation reached its nadir. Argentina were knocked out on penalties by Uruguay; Messi was jeered by his own fans. It was noted that he didn’t sing the anthem and those who questioned his allegiance claimed he didn’t know the words.Messi had become a global superstar thanks to Barcelona and Argentina were just a peripheral part of his story. Made the difference: Messi provided a brilliant assist to set up Angel di Maria versus Switzerland . Inch perfect: The attacker whipped a sublime free-kick into the top corner against Nigeria . Not now, however. Messi is clearly integral to Argentina. From the moment he announced himself at this World Cup with his goal at the Maracana, to the last-minute winner against Iran, to the two goals that perplexed Nigeria and the run and pass that created the decisive goal against Switzerland, Messi has been at the heart of this team. As for Belgium, it is tempting to view them as extras in a drama constructed around one man.‘I think he’s been outstanding,’ said Tottenham’s Jan Vertonghen when asked about that man. ‘Obviously he’s their main man. There are many other players to watch but he’s been outstanding in the games I’ve watched.’ Pre-match: Messi and his team-mates chat in training ahead of their quarter-final against Belgium . Leading the way: Messi at the front as Argentina train in Brasilia before their last-eight match . However, Marc Wilmots, the Belgium coach, appears confident, saying: ‘People tend to focus on Messi, and rightly so, but the team isn’t just one player but a whole. 'I also saw they left a number of scoring opportunities for Switzerland. I don’t think we need to fear anyone. We won’t adapt to their style. It’s a quarter final and we can write history.’ With their array of Premier League stars, Belgium could of course stop the story in it tracks. Switzerland, a lesser side, managed to frustrate them. If Eden Hazard were to shine, if Vincent Kompany can maintain his imperious demeanour against the greatest player of this generation, if Divock Origi can demonstrate more of the raw talent that has led Liverpool to sign him, they surely have a chance. Joking around: Aguero gestures to Messi during Argentina's training session at the National Stadium . Argentina have been laboured in this tournament thus far. The defence looks chaotic at time; Javier Maschrano and Fernando Gago don’t appear to be able to offer them adequate protection; Angel Di Maria has been erratic; Gonzalo Higuain is misfiring. In fact, it is beginning to look a little like Messi and 10 others, just as the 1986 side was Maradona and the rest. He is surrounded by some fine players. But what lifts this side from being merely good to being excellent is clearly the presence of one man, whose ability and experience is far above anyone else left at this World Cup. ‘As in politics, so in football, in Argentina we are always looking for one man to save us,’ said Jorge Valdano, the 1986 World Cup winner last week. ‘If we win the World Cup, the people will crown Messi with laurels; if not it will be a crown of thorns.’ Training: Messi holds Aguero, who is recovering from injury, steady, and (right) practises free-kicks .

"By . Rob Draper . Follow @@draper_rob . Phil Jagielka is one of the Premier League's honest professionals. He probably knew he had not played well on Thursday night against Uruguay, yet he was prepared to discuss the performance and reflect on England's campaign. 'World Cup football at its worst,' said Jagielka, describing the disappointment, before he was quizzed on some of the positive aspects of the attacking play and the emergence of younger players. 'Yeah, but we've not come to this tournament just to blood youngsters, turn up and hopefully they do well. We've come here to do well, to perform and to qualify.' Downbeat: Steven Gerrard, Phil Jagielka, Daniel Sturridge and Glen Johnson during training on Saturday . It was succinct and correct. There might be some building blocks for Euro 2016 from the rubble of this World Cup but five-year plans are football's biggest cliche. The trick of the job is to get results while developing a team. Roy Hodgson needs to be judged on what happened in Brazil, not on what might happen in France in two years' time, and even with expectations at an all-time low he managed to underachieve here. Everyone wanted to see progress in Brazil but nobody said there was a free pass to lose the opening two games. England had a difficult group but nobody anticipated them being out within five days. And though everyone was aware Luis Suarez would be a huge threat, it was not unreasonable to expect to match a nation of three million and a country which finished fifth in the South American group and qualified by beating Jordan in a play-off. 'Results colour everything,' said Hodgson. 'Results colour your judgment, colour everybody's judgment. I'm happy with the way the players prepared for these games and the way they approached the tournament. I'm really happy with the dedication and effort they have put in. But we've played two experienced and strong teams and on both occasions we've come out second.' At the heart of this World Cup campaign is a conundrum. How was Hodgson - a coach associated with meticulous planning, rigid team shape and solidity - undone by an excess of attacking? Disappointment: England were undone by defensive lapses against Italy and Uruguay . Almost everyone embraced the idea of aggressive, forward-thinking football. Indeed, the biggest fear was Hodgson would fail to embrace the public mood. Pundits, media, players and public were united that it was the way forward and because it has failed that does not mean the idea was a bad one. Hodgson galvanised the nation with a defeat last Saturday because England looked like a proper international team. But in our desire to be something more than the dire 2010 team or the less-than-dynamic 2006 squad, we overdid the enthusiasm. Certainly foreign journalists were bemused by the phlegmatic reaction to defeat. Now it would be trite to carry on regardless and without modification. England should play on the front foot and the nature of the players emerging dictates that they will. That said, at times it looked as though England were stuck in sixth gear, racing forwards and unable to move down through the cogs when required. The intention was to play with full backs pushed on, as is the fashion, to overwhelm the opposition. And it worked on occasions. When Daniel Sturridge released Glen Johnson to get into the box and set up Wayne Rooney for his goal against Uruguay, there was the proof. Leighton Baines, criticised for his defensive work, was singled out by Diego Maradona for causing Uruguay problems. Forward planning: Wayne Rooney could take over Steven Gerrard's playmaker role . However, . there is a flipside. Baines being so far forward as England attacked . just before Suarez's opening goal affected the defensive shape and . allowed the Liverpool striker to drift between the left-back and . Jagielka to score. The . goal for which Baines received most blame, when Italy's Antonio . Candreva turned him the wrong way to cross for Mario Balotelli,  had as . much to do with Danny Welbeck's positioning. As an instinctive forward . player, Welbeck could not get back in time to prevent the run of Matteo . Darmian, leaving Baines exposed. That, however, is the manner of modern football. Full-backs have to be great attackers and solid defenders. Baines proved adept at one part of the task, but not the other. Indeed, England's defensive shape was the most worrying aspect of the tournament. Hodgson cannot suddenly conjure better defenders - though Ashley Cole's absence and the unwillingness to bring back John Terry look unwise now - but this manager's teams are traditionally well organised. In a conversation after the Peru warm-up game, Hodgson was complimented on the team's set-pieces, yet he was nonplussed. 'What we worked hard on (in Portugal) was our shape,' he said. 'I'd have been much happier if you'd said to me, ""I thought the shape of the team was good tonight"".' Big fan: Diego Maradona singled out England defender Leighton Baines for praise . For the first 30 minutes against Italy . and for 25 minutes in the second half against Uruguay, the shape was . good and the tactics worked. Yet in the key moments which decided both . games, defenders were pulled out of position. Had Hodgson set up . cautiously like he did at Euro 2012, he might have been vilified but . would probably have two points by now. As a coach, he performed better . two years ago when he coaxed more from a limited group. Then there is the issue of Steven Gerrard. Uruguay nullified him with a simple game plan which had all the hallmarks of Suarez's inside knowledge. Stop Gerrard distributing the ball from the back and  England become a disjointed and nervous team in possession. Nicolas Loderio and Edinson Cavani did that job excellently. They also harried Jagielka and Cahill, meaning England rarely had any fluidity and could not establish a passing game. Disrupting England ought not to be so simple. Gerrard may well retire from international football this week and England have a dearth of players who can fulfil his midfield holding role, which is going to be Hodgson's biggest problem now. Perhaps Wayne Rooney will one day do the job. Those who have managed him believe that is a serious possibility. For now Hodgson will stay and choose to take the positives. 'I believe England have a very strong basis for a team,' he said. 'It's a very young team. In the space of two years these players have to get  better and stronger. Playing together as an England team will make them better and stronger. Influence: England could have done with experience of John Terry and Ashley Cole in Brazil . 'I've never doubted that as this team move forward, not just to 2016 but even on from there, they will do so. But for the moment they have to suck on this very, very bitter pill that their hopes and dreams have floundered here because we weren't able to win the games.' An absence of viable alternatives means Hodgson will be allowed to continue. However, he can't always be looking two years ahead. Attacking football is part of the answer but England failed playing it in Brazil. If Hodgson doesn't make changes, if he cannot uncover better defenders and it proves impossible to replace Gerrard, England will stay in the realm of five-year plans, bright futures and false hope for the next big tournament.","Even with expectations at an all-time low England managed to underachieve .

"By . Rob Draper . Follow @@draper_rob . Luis Suarez is understood to be taking advice from a Spanish lawyer with strong links to Barcelona to help him in his appeal against his four-month ban for biting. Juan de Dios Crespo is working with Suarez and the Uruguayan FA with the ongoing appeal to FIFA against the punishment, which also includes a nine-match international ban, after Suarez’s initial legal pleas, which included a denial that the bite took place, proved disastrous and only antagonised FIFA’s disciplinary commission. Barcelona are believed to have insisted that Suarez make a public apology if he wants to move to the Catalan club from Liverpool this summer – and the player obliged yesterday, admitting his guilt for the first time and apologising to Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini. Back home: Luis Suarez with his son upon his return to Uruguay following his ban . All smiles: This is what Suarez would like if Barcelona managed to clinch his signature from Liverpool . VIDEO Barca's praise for sorry Suarez . Now De Dios Crespo, the same lawyer Barcelona have used to help them fight their transfer ban that was imposed by FIFA after they were found guilty of infringing regulations in signing youth-team players from abroad, is also working on the case. The respected Spanish lawyer is an expert on sports law and on FIFA’s procedures and his engagement and Suarez’s public apology indicates that the line of defence is likely to change from the ham-fisted attempt by the Uruguayan Federation to divert blame for the incident. Suarez’s defence is now likely to include an admission that he bit Chiellini, a display of contrition and a plea for mitigation. As such, it is likely that he will face a reduced ban and could be playing for Barcelona early next season, if his move from Liverpool is completed. Shame: Suarez received a nine-game international ban and four month suspension from football . Accident? Suarez previously told FIFA he did not deliberately bite Giorgio Chiellini but fell on top of him . Showing support: Uruguay fans wore masks of their star striker during the World Cup defeat against Colombia . In his initial submission to the FIFA Disciplinary Commission, Suarez was quoted as saying: ‘In the run-up to the impact, my knees came together, I lost my balance and that destabilised my body and I fell into my opponent. 'In that moment, my face came into collision with the player, causing a small bruise on my cheekbone and a lot of pain to my teeth, which caused the referee to stop play. That is what happened and in no event did I, as is written in the document, ‘bite’ or ‘try to bite.’ However, the attempt to deny the incident appears to have been an enormous misjudgement by Suarez and his legal team and resulted in a more severe sanction than might have been expected had any contrition been shown, as the FIFA Disciplinary Commission noted ‘that at no point did the player show any contrition or repentance of any type, nor did he admit any violation of FIFA regulations and has therefore not shown any knowledge of having committed any offence.’","Suarez understood to be taking advice from a Spanish lawyer with strong Barcelona links in his biting ban appeal .

"By . Rob Draper . Follow @@draper_rob . It is as close as you will come in Brazil to an Argentinian receiving a compliment. Lance! — the nation’s leading sports newspaper — wanted to reflect the supreme performance of Leo Messi against Nigeria last week. ‘From another planet!’ read its headline before listing, in order, the footballers it thought worthy of that accolade. Out of this world: Messi has made a blistering start to this World Cup, with four goals in three group games . Holy trinity: Lionel Messi and Diego Maradona honoured by Argentina fans who compare the pair to Gods . No 1 was Pele; No 2 Garrincha; No 3 Romario; No 4 Ronaldo (the Brazilian one); No 5 Maradona; No 6 Messi. ‘And before long Messi will overtake Maradona as the greatest Argentinian of all time,’ it went on. ‘As for overtaking the others, well that’s just too much!’ But Messi knows — and all of Brazil, even with their love for Neymar, knows — that this is his World Cup. The tens of thousands of Argentinians who are colonising Brazil this month, camping out in their cars on Copacabana or overwhelming Porto Alegre, are all anticipating it. Everyone senses it. Video footage emerged of Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama jokingly berating Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli at half-time for giving Messi too many fouls. Magician: Maradona led Argentina to the 1986 World Cup and is still regarded more highly than Messi . God amongst men: If Argentina triumph in Brazil Messi may start to compare to the legend of Maradona . ‘I know your job is difficult,’ says Rizzoli and Enyeama rolls his eyes and says: ‘He’s so good!’ Never has a World Cup been so accommodating for Messi. ‘In 2006 and 2010 we already knew he had enormous talent, but he was still young and had to mature,’ said Javier Zanetti, the former Inter right-back. ‘In the last three to four years he has grown a lot and is now the captain and takes more responsibility. It seems that this will be Leo’s World Cup.’ For now, Messi has to defer to the original great of Argentina. In Brazil, Argentina fans parade a banner that depicts Maradona, the Pope and Messi; all three are considered national icons but only one is referred to on the banner as ‘God’ and it’s not the man from St Peter’s, nor the man from Barcelona. And for some of the old school, the quietness, the modesty of Messi wil never compare with the charisma that surrounded Maradona. Greatest ever: Pele (left) and Garrincha (right) are all-time greats, but Messi is approaching their level . Responsibility: Becoming captain seems to have raised the Barcelona star's game in international football . Supported: Messi is the centre of the Argentina team, but needs them to provide him a solid base to shine . VIDEO All Star XI: Lionel Messi . Hector Enrique, part of Argentina’s 1986 World Cup-winning team and an assistant in 2010 when Maradona managed Messi and the national team, said: ‘Messi does not have anything on Maradona. 'I love Messi and I would be happy if my son had one per cent of his ability, but Maradona was unique. 'There will never be anyone like him again, not even if Messi wins three World Cups in succession or scores a bicycle kick from midfield.’ And there has been an equivocation about Messi in Argentina in the past. After all, he left for Europe when he was just 13 and so has spent more of his life in Barcelona than in his homeland. The fact he couldn’t replicate his Barca form with the national side has been held against him. He had to fight against those who claimed he didn’t care for his country as much as his club. The subtext was: ‘Unlike Maradona.’ The situation reached a nadir when Argentina hosted the 2011 Copa America, played poorly and were knocked out by Uruguay on penalties. On target: Messi hammers home his first goal against Nigeria to give Argentina the lead . Double delight: A sumptuous free-kick made Messi the joint top scorer in the group stages in Brazil . Messi was asked why he didn’t sing the national anthem, the malicious explanation being that he didn’t know the words, and was whistled by the home crowd, prompting his father, Jorge, to speak of the ‘terrible pressure’ his son endured playing for his country. That has dissipated in recent years, though Jorge Valdano, another 1986 winner, touched on the darker elements of a nation placing so much faith in an individual. ‘As in politics, in Argentina we are always looking for one man to save us,’ wrote Valdano in his newspaper column. ‘If Argentina win the World Cup, the people will crown him with laurels. Otherwise, they will put a crown of thorns on him.’ That said, from the moment he announced himself at the World Cup with his goal at the Maracana, to his last-minute strike to salvage a win against Iran and his utter domination of the game against Nigeria, it has seemed likely he would lead an otherwise under-performing Argentina side to the final. Inspiration: Messi's performances have silenced critics who said he could not perform on the world stage . Switzerland stand in their way on Tuesday and after that, should they win, a potential quarter-final against Belgium or the USA and then a possible semi against Holland. His team-mates are in little doubt as to his importance. ‘Messi is the best in the world — there is no question about that,’ said Angel di Maria. ‘When I am an old man I will tell my grandchildren bedtimes stories about when I won the Champions League and hopefully about when I won the World Cup. 'But most of all I will tell them that their grandfather used to play with Lionel Messi — that is an indication of how special he is. ‘The problem is that when Argentina or Barcelona doesn’t play well, the press think it is easy to blame Messi.’ Surrounded: No defence has yet managed to shackle the Argetinian star, and Switzerland have a tough ask . Right now, this is not an issue. He is absolutely rising to the occasion; it is his team-mates who have yet to impress. Defensively they have looked shocking. ‘He cannot win every game alone,’ said former Argentina forward Claudio Caniggia. ‘He needs the team to defend.’ But if the defenders can defend and the midfielders provide the ballast, then perhaps Messi can lead them to their first World Cup triumph since 1986. Then he might even knock Romario and Ronaldo off that Brazilian list; not Garrincha and Pele though — that really would be too much.","Messi scored four times in Group stages .

"By . Rob Draper . Follow @@draper_rob . Per Mertesacker expresses the point succinctly. The Arsenal defender, who takes on Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal on Monday, knows there is a degree of impatience in Germany as Joachim Low’s national team begin their World Cup campaign in Salvador. In recent tournaments, Germany have been playing the unfamiliar role of eager young hopefuls. In 2006, as host nation, they feared they would be chronically embarrassed at their own party, yet they ended up heroic losers in an epic semi-final with Italy. In 2010, the young team that ripped apart England in Bloemfontein, with Mesut Ozil, Thomas Muller, Sami Khedira, Jerome Boateng and Manuel Neuer to the fore, was full of World Cup debutants who were stopped only by the irresistible Spain, again in the semi-final. Holding court: Per Mertesacker addresses his German team-mates during training last week . Crunch: Mertesacker (right) challenges Yura Movisyan during Germany's 6-1 win over Armenia . Young guns: Thomas Muller jumps on Mesut Ozil as Germany beat England in South Africa in 2010 . Today’s players have no such mitigation should they fail. They are no longer a team for the future; this generation have to deliver now. ‘We finished the last two World Cups in third position and that is really consistent,’ says Mertesacker. ‘What we need in Germany after all these years is a title as well. We’re talking all about titles and trophies.’ Indeed. It is 1996 since they last delivered a trophy, winning the European Championship at  Wembley. Granted, in the intervening years they have reached the World Cup final in 2002 and semis in 2006 and 2010, as well as reaching the Euro 2008 final and Euro 2012 semi-final. What England would give for failure on that scale? Nevertheless, this team are now experienced tournament players, many of them Champions League  winners. ‘The level of this team is really high and that comes with experience,’ says Lukas Podolski, Mertesacker’s Arsenal team-mate. In 2006, levels of expectation weren’t so high. Now they are. Other teams look at us differently. In 2006 and 2010 we were the hunters; now we’re the hunted.’ Confident: Arsenal team-mates Lukas Podolski (left) and Per Mertesacker believe Germany can do well . The captain remains the unflappable Philip Lahm, who has been transformed from a full-back into an outstanding holding midfielder under Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich. ‘I like the fact that expectations are so high,’ says Lahm. ‘Firstly, it’s normal: we’ve had two third-place finishes and we have to try to improve on that in Brazil. This team have been together for a long time, we have come very far. ‘Of course they want us to win the World Cup back home. Maybe it would be easier for us if there were no expectations, if we were able to play with a sense of freedom. But that’s not our reality. I’d much rather be considered one of the favourites than one of the underdogs.’ Bayern boys: Philip Lahm and Toni Kroos (right) are part of strong Bayern contingent in the Germany squad . Lahm is part of the core of Bayern players, which includes Muller, Bastian Schweinsteiger and, more recently, Boateng, Neuer and Toni Kroos, who were gaining a reputation as gallant losers. With their country they lost the Euro 2008 final, 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 semis; with their club they had been defeated in the 2010 and 2012 Champions League finals. When the big games came, Bayern’s Germany players seemed to be serial losers. So the all-German 2013 Champions League final between Bayern and Borussia Dortmund at Wembley was hugely significant. Bayern’s players ended their losing run and Mertesacker agrees that Germany’s rise in prowess in the Champions League has made a considerable  difference to the national team. ‘What Munich achieved by reaching three finals in four years is adorable,’ he adds. ‘Five or 10 years ago there was a massive gap between Germany and the leading Champions League countries.’ Defining moment: Bayern Munich celebrate beating Dortmund to win the 2013 Champions League final . As well Portugal and Ghana, Germany also face the USA, now coached by Jurgen Klinsmann, their former manager. Klinsmann gave Mertesacker his debut and recruited Low as No 2, pushing his assistant to take his job when he left. Mertesacker adds: ‘For those who were together with Jurgen over a couple of years, it’s going to be a very special game. He gave us our confidence back. This German side needed Jurgen when he started in 2004 and then in 2006. ‘A lot of memories will come back when we face him. I am looking forward to it. Everyone is grateful that we spent time with him.’","Germany's last lifted a major title when they won Euro 1996 .

"By . Rob Draper . Follow @@draper_rob . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is as positive a character as you might wish to find around the England camp, so even when his World Cup appeared to be in jeopardy he still clung to hope. In the sterile surroundings of a Miami medical centre last week Oxlade-Chamberlain submitted to the medical scan on his injured knee that would tell him if his World Cup was over and crossed his fingers — literally. ‘I actually sat in the scanner with the fingers crossed on both my hands for the whole 25 minutes,’ said Oxlade-Chamberlain. All smiles: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) is positive that he'll be fit to play a part for England at the World Cup . ‘At the end I couldn’t feel my fingers. After I came out our doctor saw the scan results and was pretty happy with them, considering what they’d feared. They’d thought it could have been a lot worse than it was. I was obviously a bit worried.’ With good reason: the collision with Ecuador’s Carlos Gruezo in England’s penultimate warm-up game looked bad, as the Arsenal man winced with pain and crumpled to the floor. He added: ‘In the next 10 seconds you try to figure out how painful it is, and how bad it could be. ‘You get up straight away to try to walk it off, and if you can’t walk it off you panic a bit more. On the mend: Oxlade-Chamberlain (right) is recovering from a knee injury sustained against Ecuador . ‘But I walked off the pitch — that was obviously a positive step — and, from my previous experience with my knee, I could gauge it wasn’t as bad as that in the dressing room. I just kept my fingers crossed and tried to keep positive about it. ‘Straight after, I sat in the dressing room and I was thinking, “You can’t get yourself in a pickle and get yourself down, because the situation is not going to change. What’s happened has happened”. ‘You can either stay positive and look forward and look how you are going to get over it or you do the opposite and get yourself down. And that is not going to get you anywhere.’ Heavy hit: Oxlade-Chamberlain (right) was fouled hard by Ecuador's Carlos Gruezo (bottom) in June's friendly . Eleven days on he is now out- running the physios overseeing his rehabilitation and hopes to be available to play against Uruguay — although you can see England manager Roy Hodgson holding him back for the Costa Rica game. ‘We are not sure about timescales but we are hopeful that Uruguay would be realistic,’ said Oxlade-Chamberlain. ‘There is nothing set in stone and I can’t say whether I will definitely be back or not. We just know we are very positive about it and we are going to keep pushing towards it.’ He was playing so well against Ecuador, especially given the fact that much of his Arsenal season was disrupted by a knee injury and then a groin strain, that you would imagine he will get his chance when he is back. As such he is now embracing everything the World Cup has to offer, the opening match between Brazil and Croatia having made quite an impression. Shattered dreams: Oxlade-Chamberlain (bottom) feared his World Cup could be over after Gruezo's challenge . ‘It started off in fine fashion with the Brazilian national anthem,’ he said. ‘That is where I really saw them going for it. The Brazilians singing the anthem really hit home. ‘Usually you have the Brazilians down to be cool calm customers but they were really passionate about it. You could see how much it meant to them and the whole nation. When you are in the mix of it here, it really brings it alive.’ Put Oxlade-Chamberlain down as a singer rather than a mumbler when he does get the chance to line up for the anthems. It will be fitting if he does get to play, for it was his performance last summer when he came on against Brazil in the Maracana that marked him down as potential game-changer in this tournament. Encouraging: Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) says walking off the pitch was a positive sign for his knee injury . ‘It’s a nice memory for me to cling to for the rest of my life,’ he said, recalling his goal and 30-minute appearance that changed the game. ‘Let’s hope there are more memories like that. Having that taste last year, and being able to score against Brazil in the Maracana, and now being in the World Cup with a chance to emulate that, it’s a massive motivation. I took that coming into this tournament and I still have that same thought in my head now.’ In playing at the Maracana, he followed in the footsteps of his father, Mark Chamberlain. The former  England, Stoke and Portsmouth winger played in the 2-0 friendly win in 1984 and plans to come out to watch his son if England progress. However, Alex has already outstripped him in terms of England caps — 15 so far to his father’s eight — and playing at the World Cup would also be something his father never achieved. Golden moment: Oxlade-Chamberlain scored England's second goal in their 2-2 draw vs Brazil in June last year . As for the intensity and pressure that will surround a World Cup match, he is remarkably matter of fact. ‘It’s a game of football isn’t it?’ he deadpanned. When pressed, he conceded: ‘Well, it’s a big game of football; just more people watch it! It doesn’t change the game and how you approach it. ‘I will try to do the same things I always do. Because it is a World Cup, it’s on a bigger scale and more people watch it, so that gives you the extra motivation and buzz. On point: Oxlade-Chamberlain said Brazil's 3-1 opening World Cup win against Croatia made a mark on him . ‘It is what you watch as a kid  growing up; it is what everyone back home is watching, everyone here and everyone around the world. It is just on a bigger stage.’ Oxlade-Chamberlain’s versatility also gives him increased hope of caps here, given that he can play central midfield as well as wide. ‘When I play in midfield and have a good game, that’s my favourite position; then I play out wide and score a goal, that’s my favourite position; and when I played in goal at Stamford Bridge I realised that’s not my best position…’ he said, offering the last phrase with a wry smile. Mistaken identity: Kieran Gibbs (left) was wrongly dismissed by Andre Marriner in Arsenal's 6-0 loss at Chelsea . He is, of course, referring to the debacle of his handball against Chelsea in Arsenal’s 6-0 defeat. It gave Chelsea their third goal from a penalty and saw his team-mate Kieran Gibbs sent off in error, even though Oxlade-Chamberlain told referee Andre Marriner that he was to blame. For now, despite his injury, he seems to be enjoying every aspect of this experience, except when he has to defer to Wayne Rooney at snooker. Oxlade-Chamberlain is, it appears, a bad loser. He revealed: ‘I lost to him at snooker the other day. I was on the black ball and I potted the white, it was unbelievable. It would have been the best comeback of my life. I stormed off to my room.’ So how did Rooney react? ‘Wazza was laughing, as always,’ he said.","Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is positive he'll play in the World Cup .

"By . Maarten Meijer . Manchester . United's players have been getting to know new boss Louis van Gaal and . will be getting familiar with his personality and some of his managerial . traits. Here, . Sportsmail has exclusive extracts from Maarten Meijer's explosive new . book on the Dutchman which lifts the lid on the new man in charge at Old . Trafford. The Old Trafford dressing room has superstars and superstars have egos. But United players are about to learn that Louis van Gaal is big enough to take on any truculent star who thinks he is bigger than the club. Born winner: Louis van Gaal celebrates Bayern Munich's Bundesliga title victory back in 2010 . First leg: Franck Ribery looks bemused at Van Gaal's antics while Arjen Robben smiles at the crowds . Superstars: The Manchester United squad are set to learn that Van Gaal is capable of taking on the biggest egos . For the . Dutchman, moving into Manchester United will be a re-run of when he was . made manager of German giants Bayern Munich. Van Gaal spent four months . fighting to impose his will on a dressing-room full of big-name players . who thought they had a divine right to wear the shirt. Volatile . Italian striker Luca Toni, one of those who fell out with the . forthright coach, revealed just how far Van Gaal went to show who was in . charge. ‘I remember how he once tried to make it clear that he wasn’t afraid to withdraw the so-called big names,’ Toni said.  ‘He just dropped his trousers to show us that he had the b***s to do so.’ Munich in 2009 sounds much like the remit for Manchester United now: a big club fallen on bad times; huge expectation but fear of failure; taking over from a manager who had been in charge for less than a year. United fans should be warned that if he follows the same blueprint, and he probably will, expect things to get worse before they get better. Van Gaal’s start at Munich was so poor and so  disruptive that by late October he was one game from the sack. Yet he  survived, and finished that first campaign by winning the Bundesliga and German Cup double as well as getting to the Champions League final. Munich were in a mess when he arrived after the 300-day reign of Jurgen Klinsmann and Van Gaal was seen as the saviour, just as he is in Manchester after David Moyes’ failure. Hard at work: Wayne Rooney is put through his paces during Man United training in LA on Monday . Fall-out: Luca Toni (right) recalls one occasion at Munich when Van Gaal dropped his pants to prove a point . He announced himself at his first press . conference by reciting the club’s motto: ‘Mia san mia’ (We are who we . are) and asserting: ‘I am who I am: confident, dominant and honest; a . workaholic, innovative but also warm and family friendly.’ Few agreed with the second part of that statement as he set about imposing his plans. Within days of taking over, he made it clear that defender Lucio, captain of Brazil’s national team and a first choice at Bayern for five years, did not fit into his plans and sold him to Inter Milan. He continually left out Franck Ribery, the Bundesliga Player of the Year 12 months earlier, because he didn’t agree with Van Gaal’s plan to play him as a No 10, preferring to stay on the left wing. It took Van Gaal 10 matches of tinkering before he settled on a preferred line-up, during which time the team seemed rudderless and the coach’s credentials were questioned. For the first four months he and Bayern Munich looked incompatible. There was speculation that he would be sacked if Bayern couldn’t beat Eintracht Frankfurt in late October. With four minutes left and the score 1-1, Van Gaal replaced Toni with defender Martin Demichelis and moved centre-half Daniel van Buyten up front. A home crowd of 69,000 whistled and jeered but two minutes later Van Buyten headed in Thomas Muller’s cross. It proved one of several season-defining moments. The tensions in a frustrated team regularly bubbled to the surface, and sometimes spilled into public view, such as when Toni was substituted at half-time in a game against Schalke and the Italian promptly went home. Success: Van Gaal took ten games to settle on a preferred line-up before leading Bayern to the title . As one of the mutineers who couldn’t get on with Van Gaal, he was given short shrift. ‘We have rules and we have to work within the rules,’ said the coach. ‘Luca Toni did not. Every player, whether he is a world champion or whatever, has to accept he does not always play.’ Others spoke out. Ribery said that the coach’s philosophy was hard to understand. ‘In training no-one is laughing. Everything is too serious,’ he said. Defender Philipp Lahm gave an interview in which he criticised everything from the club’s transfer policy to tactics. He was fined. Van Gaal’s time at Barcelona was punctuated by conflict. Despite his success in the first two seasons, they were three fraught years. He struggled to connect with the Catalan fans and his failure to  master Spanish often led to him losing his cool at press conferences. When he left he announced: ‘Friends of the press I am leaving. Congratulations.’ He had to fight to make players understand his vision and his tactical rigour caused friction. That was nowhere more clear than in his . relationship with Rivaldo, the Brazilian prima donna who had cost . Barcelona €20million. For two seasons he was at the top of the scoring . charts but then fell out with his manager in the third. Conflict: Van Gaal had to fight to make players at Barcelona understand his vision and tactics . Rivaldo refused to play on the left of a 4-3-3 system and his punishment was a spell on the bench.Telling the World Player of the Year to stick to his position on the left or make space for others instead of roaming freely may well have been integral to a tactical  plan but it was not the best way to survive the football politics of Catalonia. Replacing Barca superstars with a busload of former Ajax players,  did not endear him to the locals either. In the end there were more enemies than friends; more tiffs than trophies. Only time will tell how his methods will go down in United’s dressing-room. Tactical mastermind: Van Gaal, pictured with assistant Ryan Giggs, will be keen to get his methods across . VIDEO United will continue to spend - Woodward . At Bayern Munich, even the club’s management had doubts about the way Van Gaal was  emerging as a control freak as he fought to deal with issues behind the scenes. There are echoes of Sir Alex Ferguson in Van Gaal’s style but, initially, it didn’t go down well at Bayern. President Uli Hoeness said:  ‘Bayern can no longer be controlled by one person. Louis van Gaal is of the opinion that he has to organise everything by himself, but an individual cannot handle all of that.’The great Franz Beckenbauer told the individualistic Dutchman to ‘delegate more responsibility’. The board even questioned, albeit implicitly, the professional confidence of their head coach by suggesting it might be better to switch from a 4-3-3 system to 4-4-2. Van Gaal simply stuck to his methods. He said: ‘When I started with Ajax in 1991 in the first half of the season the people only wanted Johan Cruyff. That wasn’t fun for me. Not fun: Van Gaal's first few months at Ajax were difficult as fans would have preferred Johan Cruyff . ‘With Barcelona in 1997 it was the same. It took four or five months before it was much better.  It was similar with AZ and exactly the same with Bayern. ‘I predicted at the beginning of the season we would need a few months’ patience until everything worked out. The trophies are handed out in May.’ He was proved right. By the end of the season the Germans were partying with their two domestic trophies and despite missing out on a treble when  they lost in Madrid to Jose Mourinho’s Inter Milan, they had re-established themselves at Europe’s top table. Manchester United fans will pray that, even if the going gets tough for the first few months, their new manager will be proved right again. And that he’s still got the b***s to do the job.

"By . Rob Draper . Follow @@draper_rob . Faith healers, psychiatrists, psychologists: England have tried them at various times. But maybe there is one ingredient missing from this year’s World Cup preparations. Rickie Lambert, the newly signed Liverpool striker, might suggest Southampton’s pre-season routine of walking over hot coals as a means to inspire the team. For Lambert credits Southampton’s pre-season training camp, during which manager Mauricio Pochettino persuaded him to walk across the hot coals, as the reason for the extraordinary season that has seen him make his England debut and earn his £4million move to Liverpool. Living the dream: Rickie Lambert (left) celebrates scoring for England against Ecuador . ‘Mauricio got some fella in to try and give you that winning mentality,’ said Lambert. ‘It was very interesting. One of his methods was to walk across burning coal bare footed.  It was a challenge, mind over matter. You knew nothing worse could happen to you during the season.’ It clearly did Southampton no harm, as it propelled them to eighth in the table. But Lambert does believe that the amount of conditioning and training undergone during pre-season under Pochettino is responsible for the presence of three Southampton players in this England squad, with Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw also included . ‘That was the easy part walking on hot coals,’ said Lambert, 32, who spent most of his career in the lower leagues but who now can hope to play in the World Cup finals. ‘That was a relaxing afternoon. Mauricio took us away for 18 days to do all the conditioning work. Inspired: Mauricio Pochettino used walking across hot coals as a technique to get the best from Lambert . ‘The pre-season he gave us was horrendous to do, but it benefitted us all, especially Adam. It gave him an extra yard of pace, an extra bit of strength., He's always had the skill, he's always had the vision. He's always had everything but (this season) he was able to shrug people off and he was able to run past people. ‘I am not saying he was slow last year or anything like that, but that's what I've noticed the most.  He's always been able to do everything else, but the fitness and the sharpness that the gaffer put into him is what I think has pushed him onto the next level.’ Pochettino, as an Argentine, might be an unlikely England hero; then again, he was the man who tripped Michael Owen in 2002 to give away the penalty which David Beckham converted for when England to beat Argentina. Pochettino it is who has helped turn Lambert, whose career had taken in Blackpool, Macclesfield, Stockport, Rochdale and Bristol Rovers, into an international player. ‘I had never really been taught how to play as a lone striker,’ said Lambert. ‘I never really got taught to be a striker in the first place and then I never got taught how to be a lone striker. But he taught me. The thing that I was doing wrong most was the fact I thought I had to show for everyone on the pitch. ‘Whoever had the ball, I felt I had to run over and show for the ball, get on the ball. He was saying: “Take your time to wait until the right people have got onto the ball, like Adam and others further up the pitch.” Red: The former Southampton striker will play his football for Liverpool next season after a £4m move . That's when you become effective and when you can make your movement, get on the ball and just channel all my efforts into the right places. After that, I had an understanding of how to play that position a lot better.’ Lambert, of course, was rejected by Liverpool as a teenager but now will be returning to his home-town club after the World Cup, which means he can finally be open about that tattoo on his right shoulder. ‘It’s a Liverpool tattoo and I got it after the 2005 Champions League victory. I was at Rochdale at the time. I didn’t go to the final but I managed to go to every home game in the Champions League. It was amazing. The semi-final against Chelsea was the best atmosphere I have witnessed in my life.’ Ladder: The 32-year-old spent most of his career battling through the lower leagues . Up until now, he has been coy about it, even hiding it from the likes of his England and Liverpool captain, Steven Gerrard. ‘I don’t want to come across as a mad fan!’ said Lambert. ‘I’ve had to play it cool but the more I got involved with England, I did ask them (the Liverpool players) more questions about the manager and about how the club is run. ‘They have had nothing but good words to say, especially about Brendan Rodgers.  But that was before I knew there was any interest. I was a Liverpool fan just wanting to know how things were doing there.’ History: Liverpool fan, Lambert has a tattoo in honour of his team's 2005 Champions League success .","Rickie Lambert cites Mauricio Pochettino's inspirational management techniques for his dream season .

"By . Rob Draper . Follow @@draper_rob . Managers have a habit of talking up the opposition, especially after they have won. It’s not a particularly subtle way of amplifying your own team’s qualities. Clearly if the side you have beaten are excellent, then that only magnifies your own achievement. So when Cesare Prandelli praised England at the end his 2-1 win over them on Saturday night, the warm words had to be filtered through a more cynical prism. And yet, even given that proviso, it is worth recording what he said. ‘We know England have changed a lot in the last few years,’ said Prandelli. ‘They used to play with long balls and headers. Now England are very good playing in triangles and one on one. They really have one the strongest attacks in the World Cup. I’ve been really consistent in what I’ve been saying: we played against a great team.’ Praise: Cesare Prandelli, celebrating Italy's win on Saturday, says England are a great team . Perhaps he was ladling it on a little . by the end. England are not a great side but they do have the potential . to be a good one. It is Prandelli’s line about England playing in . triangles that perhaps offers the most encouragement. It wasn’t just . about the speed of England on Saturday night, which, should they . progress, will surely worry any side they face. They actually moved the . ball nicely at times, engineering their way out of tight spaces with . neat passing. It’s not the . first time England have done it. Foreign coaches once were similarly . complementary about the improvements that Terry Venables and Glenn . Hoddle had made to England’s style but progressive football was somehow . abandoned once the expensive foreign imports took over the reins of . management. It seems it takes an English coach to believe English . players can actually play a little: Sven Goran Eriksson and Fabio . Capello never seemed to trust them to do so. Too . often at World Cups England have been like the unwanted drunken guest, . stumbling over tables and embarrassing everyone with their inappropriate . aggression. On Saturday, in a World Cup that has sparkled so far, . England behaved like part of the in-crowd at the party, entertaining and . impressing. Net gains: Sturridge throws his arms in the air in celebration after scoring at the end of a free-flowing move . True, they . lost, a not inconsiderable draw back. But most would take defeat in this . manner over the 0-0 abject draw with Algeria in Cape Town in 2010; or . the laboured victories over Paraguay and Trinidad and Tobago in 2006. Who . would have known that Roy Hodgson had been repressing these attacking . instincts? Like a suburban bank manager who indulges a secret passion . for clubbing at the weekends, he indulged every populist call in . deploying Raheem Sterling from the start, refusing to kowtow to Wayne . Rooney and in bringing on Ross Barkley. A . few Liverpool fans might be bemused by the manager England have . employed. He would argue that he didn’t have these players at Anfield. Yet on Saturday night, England seemed to play with freedom, as though . they embracing the challenge rather enduring it. Populist: Roy Hodgson made some big calls against Italy and they very nearly came off . Not . that the game was without issues. Ultimately England’s failure to pick . up Claudio Marchisio for Italy’s first goal was inexplicable in a team . managed by Hodgson, who is so meticulous on his team shape and player . responsibilities. Good though Andrea Pirlo’s dummy was, Marchisio had a . free strike. It was a goal that was easily prevented. And Leighton . Baines won’t relish the re-runs of Antonio Candreva turning him the . wrong way to deliver the deep, looping cross for Mario Balotelli to . score. And then there is . Rooney. Hodgson defended him on Saturday night and it is true that . for long periods he performed in his required role as well as delivering . a superb cross for Daniel Sturridge’s goal. ‘We wanted to get Sterling around Pirlo because of his agility and of course that . meat moving Wayne Rooney and I thought that worked well,’ said Hodgson. Questions: Uncertainty surrounds Wayne Rooney following his patchy display against Italy . ‘He . set up the goal for us, he worked very hard and did well also when we . brought him back into the centre. There’s always going to be one player . who there’s a big debate around but I think it’s very harsh to criticise . Rooney’s performance today because for me he played well.’ That . said, Sturridge, Welbeck and Sterling played better. The debate for . Uruguay now boils down to whether Rooney is better than Adam Lallana? As . an attacking threat he is and as such he starts in a game England must . win. However, it might be argued that Lallana would have have dealt with . full back Matteo Darmian better and would have had the energy to offer . greater protection to Baines. Significantly, Hodgson felt the need to . switch Welbeck to the left at half time, to curtail the Italian right . back – though he still popped up providing the pass for Candreva’s cross . and Balotelli’s goal. Coming in? Adam Lallana might not be a better attacking option than Rooney but he knows the position . And . then there is the small matter of defeat. Under Eriksson and Capello . England often looked awful; but they didn’t lose in World Cup group . stages, though Eriksson did in his first game in Euro 2004 to France. England could be figuratively packing their bags on Thursday, slipping . out of the party before the real dancing begins, returning home after . briefly dazzling. It doesn’t feel like that, however. Not . since 1998 and the honourable exit against Argentina on penalties has . defeat felt this good. The national mood won’t feel quite so generous if . the result is the same on Thursday; but if the performance is repeated, . there is little chance that it will be.","Prandelli insists that England have changed their style a lot .

"By . Rob Draper . Follow @@draper_rob . Gary Cahill is reflecting on the challenge he faces in the next fortnight. On Saturday there is Mario Balotelli, the following Thursday it is Luis Suarez. For a defender who has never been to a major tournament before, it is some way to start. ‘I’ve said many times when I’ve come off the pitch, “I was unbelievable there for 87 minutes”,’ says Cahill. ‘And all of a sudden you switch off once, a cross comes in and he scores. It wrecks your whole game. That’s the nature of my position. One to ponder: Gary Cahill trains with England as he looks ahead to a tough clash with Italy's Mario Balotelli . ‘I wouldn’t say I come off the pitch and forget all about it because I don’t. It goes through my head. I replay it a lot but then, once you start your preparation for the next game, you want to go straight back out and play.’ Cahill, 28, is commendably light-hearted about the angst that comes with the job. Asked whether there is one error that haunts him, he laughs: ‘I was all right until you brought it up!’ It is one of the Chelsea defender’s strengths, the ability to remain upbeat. Dwelling on mistakes is hardly productive. Getting his head together: Balotelli controls a football with his head during a training session with Italy . Eye on the ball: Cahill has claimed Balotelli (above) is a world class player . ‘When goals go in, you always think, “What could you have done?”,’ he says. ‘Nine times out of 10 you are just in and around somewhere but if it is a blatant mistake, where you think, “Wow, that was totally down to me” then of course you have to learn from it. You try to make them as few as possible. Once in a blue moon, that’s the idea.’ So to Balotelli, the threat next Saturday in Manaus. The only certainty about the former Manchester City star is his capriciousness. ‘That’s dangerous isn’t it because you never know, will he turn up, will he not?’ says Cahill. ‘He’s got the potential to stick it into the top corner from 30 yards. He’s an unpredictable player but on his day he’s one of the best. Out for the count: Cahill (centre) missed Euro 2012 after picking up an injury in a warm-up clash with Belgium . ‘I played against him a couple of times at City and he’s been tough. I played against him another time when he came off after 60, 70 minutes. Unpredictable. He can be world class. They’re just dangerous players but you come up against them every game.’ Cahill’s England debut came four years ago at the age of 24 when he was part of the new wave of players coming in after the 2010 World Cup. He might have been in South Africa but his run-up to selection was disrupted by a potentially fatal blood clot, which meant he had to have a rib removed and miss a chunk of the season. He missed Euro 2012 when he broke his jaw in the last friendly, against Belgium at Wembley, before England flew out to Poland. ‘It’s my first tournament and I have waited a long time for it,’ says Cahill. ‘So for me to be involved in this is massive.’","But England centre-back labels Italy striker's form as unpredictable .

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . All eyes, not to mention camera lenses, were trained on Luis Suarez as he emerged, carrying his boots, into the sunshine at the tidy red-and-white Arena de Jacare. For Suarez, the World Cup finally seems set to start, 39 days after his last game, played alongside five Liverpool team-mates who will be opponents in Sao Paulo on Thursday. This has been a familiar pre-tournament injury saga with a slight difference. Usually it is a key England player fighting for match-sharpness; this time it is Suarez, PFA Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year, set to return for a clash that Uruguay and England dare not lose. Fighting fit? Luis Suarez is set to start against England in their World Cup Group D clash . The big man is back, as Wayne Rooney once said of himself, and Suarez is anxious to help just as the South Americans are desperate to see him reunited up front with  Edinson Cavani. ‘Trust us,’ said Suarez when asked for a message to the people of  Uruguay, who hope this World Cup in Brazil will inspire their team as it did in 1950, when they emerged as champions, beating the hosts in the final. ‘We want to put things right,’ he added, reflecting on the 3-1 defeat by Costa Rica. ‘It is still in our hands to qualify. World Cup games are tough and can be decided in only a few minutes. 'You never know what can happen. It has been a hard few days since Costa Rica. The goals came at vital times and the result slightly flattered them. Stay calm. We’re going to give our best against England. We want to move forward as we did four years ago.’ Keep calm: Suarez believes the people of Uruguay can trust their national team . It remains to be seen what condition Suarez is in for his first game after knee surgery. On Tuesday his movement did not look in any way limited as he twisted and turned, passed and dribbled in a few short and sharp training drills with Diego Forlan. There was no strapping required to support the injured knee. Earlier this week he told the  Uruguayan press he would not have travelled to Brazil had he been  unable to play his part and that his treatment had been ‘fabulous’. Another danger for England is that the Suarez circus, and the text  messages pinging back and forth with Liverpool players in England’s camp, has diverted attention from the rest of a strong team ranked seventh in the world. They have a proud tournament record, despite being humbled by Costa Rica, but Northern Ireland manager Michael O’Neill did not see much to concern Hodgson when his side lost 1-0 in a friendly in Montevideo last month, when Forlan deputised for the injured Suarez. ‘We looked back at a lot of games and they are so heavily dependent on the front two,’ said O’Neill. ‘The rest of the team is solid and workmanlike, but they don’t have a midfielder who is particularly creative. There’s not a Pirlo in there. Danger: England must also watvh out for PSG striker Edinson Cavani (left) ‘The team plays deep and the front two sometimes get isolated. It is a very rigid 4-4-2. They go quite direct. It is not a typical South American game. Suarez and Cavani want the ball early. They didn’t get a lot of men forward against us. They don’t press like, say, Chile or Argentina. ‘At the back, Diego Lugano wants to play so deep that the team gets fractured. Uruguay see him as a mainstay and a leader. I think he is the one you can play on, with the pace England have. ‘If you look at the third goal against Costa Rica, Lugano should get across and he just doesn’t have the legs anymore. Solid? England may be able to play on Diego Lugano's lack of pace at the back . 'Neither of the central midfielders is a goal threat. They like to put their foot in, but they don’t get in the box. They condense the pitch and rely on the front two. This could be the one time England go with two out-and-out strikers.’ Uruguay boss Oscar Tabarez has warned there will be changes after the Costa Rica debacle and Jorge Fucile is expected to come in at right back for Maxi Pereira, who is banned. O’Neill added: ‘That might suit Uruguay a little more because they will play with a defensive full back.’ Mixing it up: Oscar Washington Tabarez has revealed there will be changes to Uruguay's team .","Luis Suarez looks set to start for Uruguay against England on Thursday .

Leverkusen have now admitted Liverpool have made their . move and that everything has been agreed for the transfer to go through. Close: Liverpool are set to sign Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Emre Can after activating his release clause . Signal of intent: Manager Brendan Rodgers has been busy trying to sort incomings out early on for next year . Sealed: Rickie Lambert has already secured a £4m move from Southampton this close season . 'Up until yesterday, I would have said it was just . rumours about Emre,' Leverkusen's chief executive Michael Schade told German . paper Bild.  'But now I can confirm that we have received an official . offer from Liverpool, and I expect a very quick conclusion to it.' Brendan . Rodgers has been chasing the Germany Under 21 international for a while . and has been over to personally check on the player's progress. The 20-year-old is an energetic box-to-box midfielder and should provide the Reds with extra impetus in the middle of the park. Inter Milan were also keen on Can but it was always his intention to move to the Premier League. The club hope to have a deal concluded within the week as they press ahead with plans for an assault on the Premier League title. The player's agent, Reza Fazeli, is a familiar face around Anfield after brokering a loan move with the club for Nuri Sahin in 2012. Rodgers is keen to get his transfer business done early. Rickie Lambert has already signed for £4million from Southampton ahead of the World Cup and they continue to pursue England midfielder Adam Lallana. They came within a slip of winning the league last month and the belief is that if they can keep hold of Luis Suarez - who was linked with a move to Real Madrid in the Spanish press on Wednesday morning - and supplement that with shrewd additions, they'll be in a better position to challenge come August. Can is one of the most versatile young players in the Bundesliga. Having spent most of his career so far in the youth set up at Bayern Munich, the Frankfurt-born player was one pipped for the top from an extremely early age. After only four first-team appearances at Bayern, though, Can's star faded during the 2012/13 season, and so in the summer of 2013 he chose to make the switch to Leverkusen. It has done him a world of good, and he has developed into an invaluable midfield force for his new club. He has also represented Germany at every level from Under 15 to Under 21. Can prefers to play in central midfield - 'either attacking or defending, I don't care either way' - but has been employed as a centre-back and a left-back on various occasions. As captain of the German Under 17s team, he was the calming influence at the heart of play. His physical strength is of particular use going forward, though he is rarely overly reckless. It has been remarked on several occasions that Can seems to have a maturity beyond his years, and his technical ability as a playmaker, either from the back or the front, is now beyond doubt. The most commonly drawn comparison is Bastian Schweinsteiger. And not only because the young Can puts as much effort into his hairstye as Schweinsteiger once did. His ability to switch effortlessly from defence to midfield, his dangerous shot, and his control over the pace of the game all do remind one of the established Bayern star. For those watching his marauding runs through the centre at Leverkusen this season though, Toni Kroos has always also sprung to mind. It is little surprise that these two Bayern stars have had an influence on Can's play. He has trained with them, or at least in close proximity to them, for several of his formative years.

The serene setting has echoes of England’s remote base in South Africa, isolated in the red-dirt countryside of a state mined for precious metals and gemstones. Yet behind the iron gates of the Uruguayan camp in Sete Lagoas, there has been great turmoil and upheaval and an inquest into Saturday’s humbling 3-1 defeat at the hands of Costa Rica. ‘We got really heated up after the game,’ said captain Diego Lugano and although the fury has since subsided it has been replaced by paranoia ahead of Thursday’s date with England. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch All Star XI: Luis Suarez . Ready to go: Suarez sat out Uruguay's opener but believes he will be fit to play against England . High stakes: Uruguay defender Lugano described Thursday's game against England a 'life or death'. Uruguay manager Oscar Tabarez is convinced someone had been spying on a behind-closed-doors training session on Sunday, and glimpsed his tactical plans for a game both teams must win to avoid an early flight out of Brazil. There was heavy security and an aggressive door policy in operation at the JN Resort Hotel yesterday in defiance of the giant ‘Bem Vindo’ welcome sign above the door. Tabarez and Lugano both spoke at a brief press conference, immediately after which all but selected Uruguayan media were marched not only out of the hotel but beyond the perimeter fence by security staff to find shade near the cattle. Central to the intrigue has been the fitness of Luis Suarez who, during the supposed-to-be-secret training session, partnered Edinson Cavani in attack. Suarez had knee surgery ahead of the World Cup and has been in a race against time ever since. Despite insisting he would be fit, he watched from the sidelines, in his kit, as an unused substitute against Costa Rica. Officially, yesterday, there were few clues about whether he would return against England in Sao Paulo. Paranoia: Oscar Tabarez, the Urugayan coach, thinks that there have been spies at their training sessions . Shock defeat: Lugano, left, was disappointed about the Costa Rica game and said Uruguay 'got heated up' ‘It is a possibility,’ said Tabarez. ‘That is our dream,’ said Lugano. As for Suarez, he spoke later and reiterated his belief that he is ready for action. ‘I did not miss any days of my recovery,’ said Suarez. ‘At no time did I think I would miss the World Cup. If I play, it is because I am 100 per cent.’ He also flashed a warning to England, who started with five Liverpool players in the team that lost 2-1 against Italy on Saturday. ‘I know all the players in the England team, either as team-mates or opponents,’ said Suarez. ‘They have defensive deficiencies that I can take advantage of, but I will not say how. We have to move forward with strong character. Trust us.’ Those words seem to confirm what the Uruguayan press are convinced of; that he will start on Thursday, one of three changes to the team beaten in the Group D opener. Threat: Arsenal's Joel Campbell scored for Costa Rica as they shocked Uruguay in their first game . Southampton’s Gaston Ramirez is also expected to come in and experienced Porto defender Jorge Fucile will replace Alvaro Pereira who was sent off against Costa Rica. ‘We are going to change everything,’ said Tabarez. ‘We need to win. So do England. We need to change attitude and put different measures in place.’ The Costa Rica defeat did not go down well back home, seen as proof by many that this team is in its death throes after a glorious ride to World Cup semi-finals in 2010 and the Copa America title in 2011. The bulk of the squad is the same, but the feeling is they have grown old and slow together, laboured through qualification, stumbling into the World Cup via a play-off against Jordan and that Tabarez, a legend at the helm for eight years, cannot go any further. Uruguay’s aim, of course, is to disprove this theory but first they must beat England. ‘It is our greatest challenge,’ said Lugano. ‘It is life or death. England are the favourites but we have the strength for the battle. Fit again: Suarez returned to Uruguay training and is confident that he can play against England on Thursday . Up and coming: ¿They have young, quick players with great potential,' Tabarez said of England . ‘Against Costa Rica we were bad. Everyone was annoyed. The details were wrong and we were unable to change, but now we are united again.’ England supporters will fear the return of Suarez but Tabarez spoke of concern about the pace and variety at Roy Hodgson’s disposal. ‘England deserved better luck against Italy,’ said the 67-year-old former teacher. ‘They have young, quick players with great potential, but someone like Steven Gerrard is someone we cannot neglect.’ And with this compliment, the hospitality abruptly ended. Tabarez was gone and the bouncers moved in to chase all but the chosen few from the premises, out into the sun-baked hills of Minas Gerais.","Suarez has been out following knee surgery and missed opener .

"By . Martin Robinson . and Nick Fagge . Upset Frenchmen have accused British rivals of abusing them while wearing Union Jacks in skirmishes off the coast of Normandy over access to scallop stocks. New video footage has shown for the first time the intense rows between fishermen from both sides of the Channel after the entente cordiale collapsed spectacularly this week. On Monday 40 French vessels attacked a fleet of eight British boats with flares and rocks in international waters because they claim they have been fishing scallops out of season. Gallic fishermen are today seen claiming . they are being goaded by the Britons, who they say are even flashing their . bottoms from their ships as they exchange insults. Scroll down for video . Entente un-cordiale: Relations between French and British fishermen have collapsed with this man claiming Britons have been mooning them, swearing and wearing Union Jacks . 'They are mooning us, doing the finger, wearing Union Jacks,' said one French fisherman to France 24, visibly upset at what was happening. Another was filmed screaming from his ship: 'I don't understand you. Go take a jump,' while a colleague added: 'The British don't give a damn about us. The French government is protecting them.' British sailors were also filmed calling out that they were in international waters and had been for months. Yesterday they called for Royal Navy protection to stop further attempts to prevent them fishing for the highly prized mollusc in Seine Bay, off the coast of Normandy. Angry: This French fisherman said the British 'don't give a damn' as his friend smokes angrily beside him .

Trawler boss Andrew McLeod said: . 'We have every legal right to fish. We are just going to carry on plying . our legal trade and hope the French will leave us alone.' Skipper Anton Bailey, from Brixham, . south Devon, said the crews of four French boats 'threw rocks and tried . to ram us'. He added: 'They were shooting flares at other vessels – . every underhand thing you could  think of.

Television footage showed French fisherman burning English rugby shirts, swearing and making offensive gestures at the cameras. The attacks, which lasted for six . hours, came to a halt only when a French Navy vessel and the French . coastguard intervened. Fisherman Clinton Powell, from Devon, added: .

But French fishermen have vowed to . take further action after officials in Paris refused to cave in to their . demand for a ban on all fishing in the Bay of Seine, in a bid to stop . the 'pillage' of the cash-rich stock. Based in small ports on the Normandy . coast, the fishermen are within easy range of the Channel ferry ports of . Cherbourg, Calais, Le Harve, Dieppe and Caen. Paul Francoise, of the Calvados . Fishing Committee, said: 'We appealed to the French government to stop . all fishing vessels – French and British – from entering the Seine Bay, . but they said it was impossible. 'There will be further action. This will certainly mean strikes and blockades. The government must take notice.' Fisherman Claude Milliner said: . 'Enough is enough. We are going to step up our action. Instead of 40 . boats, we will be 120. We have nothing to lose. Now we are going to have . to fight to defend our livelihood. Our English friends are pillaging. They have told us that they have no intention of leaving the area.' The dispute erupted when the Normandy . fleet returned to sea on October 1 and discovered how much British . boats had harvested during the summer period, when French fishermen . maintained a voluntary ban to preserve stocks. A spokesman for the British fishermen . said: 'The French are a bit peeved because we are near to their 12-mile . limit, but the French have been fishing on our 12-mile limit for . donkeys' years.' Last night Fisheries Minister Richard . Benyon said the UK was working with the French authorities and would . 'encourage action should further incidents take place'.

"By . Steph Cockroft . A benefits cheat who swindled £21,000 of taxpayers' money posted pictures of herself clutching wads of £20 notes on Facebook - before saying she didn't understand why people were angry about her crime. Mum-of-three Linzy Greaves, from Bolsover, Derbyshire, narrowly avoided jail after falsely claiming the money for three years when she failed to declare her children had been taken into care. The 25-year-old even gloated about her wealth by posting photos of herself on Facebook clutching a bundle of cash - while giving the middle finger to the camera. Linzy Greaves, 25, from Bolsover, Derbyshire, who swindled £21,000 in benefits, posted a photo of herself on Facebook posing with wads of £20 notes . But the brazen benefits cheat said she did not understand why people were angry - and said she was not as bad as 'murderers and paedophiles'. When she was approached by the Derbyshire Telegraph, she said: 'I don't understand why people are angry. 'There are worse folk out there - murderers and paedophiles. I don't mind if people are having a go - it doesn't bother me.' The defendant was also asked if she was . ashamed of her actions to which she initially replied 'no' - before . quickly adding: 'I am. Nobody should do it.' After being convicted, the mother-of-three said: 'I don't understand why people are angry' Greaves - who also posted pictures online about a new horse she was trying out -  narrowly avoided a jail sentence earlier this month after admitting failing to declare a change in circumstances. She was given a four-week suspended prison sentence and was ordered to pay legal costs and a victim surcharge totting up to just £180 at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court. A message posted on Greaves' personal Facebook page last week said she would not repay 'a penny' of the cash she conned out of taxpayers' pockets, adding: 'Someone has to rinse the w**k Government, don't they?' But Greaves, who is unemployed, claimed that she did not post the message, insisting her account had been hacked. A joint investigation by Bolsover District Council and the Department for Work and Pensions found Greaves claimed income support, housing benefit and tax credits as a lone parent between April 2010 and April 2013. In addition to the suspended prison sentence, Greaves was also ordered to comply with a 12-week curfew between 8pm and 7am which will be monitored electronically. She was sentenced for dishonestly failing to declare a change in circumstances. The defendant, who falsely claimed the benefits between 2010 and 2013, posted online about a new horse that she was trying out . In response to Greaves' brazen repost, Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers will be understandably angry at the sight of their hard-earned cash being waved around on Facebook, especially when it's been claimed illegally. 'Benefit fraud and error totalled more than £3bn last year and the Government has to bring that down. 'That cash needs to be used for front-line services and for those who really need support, so those taking it unfairly have to be punished.'","Linzy Greaves from Bolsover, Derbyshire, falsely claimed £21,000 in benefits .

"A federal judge in Pittsburgh revoked Geiser's citizenship in 2006 and another judge ordered him deported in 2010 . Former Nazi guard: Anton Geiser, 88, came to the U.S. in 1956 and settled in the small town of Sharon, which is about 75 miles north of Pittsburgh . As U.S. authorities continue a long legal battle to deport a former Nazi concentration camp guard, it's not clear what will happen next if they prevail. Anton Geiser, now 88, has been living in a small western Pennsylvania town for more than 50 years. He didn't even tell his family about the Nazi service until 2004, when the Justice Department began legal proceedings. Geiser's lawyer will be appealing a deportation order next week, before the Board of Immigration Appeals in Falls Church, Virginia. Geiser says he was forced to join the SchutzStaffel at the age of 17, in 1942, and that he never killed anyone. ‘We hope that he is deported,’ said Joy Braunstein, director of the Holocaust Center of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh. But Kurt Schrimm, the head of the special prosecutors' office in Germany that investigates Nazi war crimes, said they aren't currently investigating Geiser's case, and the Austrian Justice Ministry said it hasn't corresponded with American authorities. Geiser says he was forced to join the SS at the age of 17, in 1942, and that he never killed anyone. And while he served as a guard at the Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald concentration camps, he didn't serve at so-called death camps, such as Treblinka and Auschwitz-Birkenau, which existed only to exterminate people. The details may be irrelevant to most people, but in past cases prosecutors mentioned death-camp service, noting the prisoners there had no option other than death. Tragic times: Soldiers of the Third Reich arrest factory leaders . 1940: German soldiers surround two male prisoners who walk with their hands up.  A translated caption with the photo is ""Bandits"" In the case of Johann Breyer of Philadelphia, another accused former Nazi guard, a judge allowed him to stay in the U.S. reasoning in part that because Breyer had joined the SS at age 17, he couldn't be held responsible for what he did as a minor. Federal prosecutors, however, say that even if Anton Geiser didn't kill anyone, his work as a concentration camp guard makes him a party to the persecution of countless men, women and children, no matter how long ago that happened. Geiser escorted prisoners to slave labor sites and was under orders to shoot any prisoners who attempted to escape. Both sides agree that Geiser guarded only the perimeter of the camps, but previous court rulings have found that doing so is enough to make someone ineligible for U.S. citizenship. Geiser told prosecutors he was ashamed of his work as a camp guard. ‘I was not proud where I served and I didn't like it then and I didn't like it now,’ he said. Geiser's lawyer, Adrian Roe, said Geiser was recently hospitalized and doesn't want to talk about the case, but added that neither he nor his client dispute that the Nazi camps were horrific and ‘outrageous’ chapters of history. Concentration bunks: Wooden bunks stand inside a children's barracks, Compound BII13, at Birkenau, part of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the largest Nazi concentration camp and extermination camp in operation during World War II . The Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald camps held some political and military prisoners, but tens of thousands of people also died there under horrific conditions, such as starvation, slave labor, medical experiments, and executions. Peter Black, the senior historian at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, said that it's ‘very difficult’ to tell whether any particular individual actually volunteered for the SS, or was pressured to join. But he said the guards were essential to the concentration camp system. ‘Even if they don't have any contact with a prisoner, by walking the perimeter as an armed guard, they are helping to keep the people inside that place where they are enduring persecution,’ Black said, adding that SS guards were paid, got leave time, and health benefits for their service. A federal judge in Pittsburgh revoked Geiser's citizenship in 2006 and another judge ordered him deported in 2010. Geiser is fighting that order. He lost a circuit court appeal in 2008, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear his case in 2009. In 2010 an immigration judge ordered him deported to Austria, or any other country that will take him.Geiser came to the U.S. in 1956 and settled in the small town of Sharon, which is about 75 miles north of Pittsburgh. He became a citizen in 1962, worked in a steel mill for decades and raised five children. Tucked away: Geiser has been living in the small western Pennsylvania town Sharon for more than 50 years . The Austrian Embassy in Washington, D.C. did not immediately respond to a question about whether the country would accept Geiser. Roe said the Board of Immigration Appeals in Fairfax, Virginia, should consider a different 2009 Supreme Court ruling when it hears Geiser's case on December 6. The legal question is ‘about when people are dragged into assisting the persecutions involuntarily,’ Roe said, referring to an asylum case involving an Eritrean man who said he was forced to guard prisoners in Ethiopia. In that case the Supreme Court ordered immigration authorities to consider whether people who were part of persecutions did so involuntarily. Roe said that no matter how the Immigration Board rules, further appeals are possible. The Justice Department didn't respond to questions for comment on the Geiser case, which is part of its efforts to investigate former Nazis. Since the 1979 inception of the program, it has won more than 100 cases.

"By . Laura Collins . The housekeeper at the center of the Indian diplomat scandal has broken her silence on the day that diplomat Devyani Khobragade was indicted on two criminal charges. ‘I would like to tell other domestic workers who are suffering as I did – you have rights and do not let anyone exploit you,’ she said. Khobragade was charged by a federal grand jury in Manhattan with visa fraud and making false statements in a case that has triggered outcry both in the States and in India. Exploited: Sangeeta Richard wants to see her former boss prosecuted in the U.S. and is bitterly disappointed that Devyani Khobragade was granted diplomatic immunity allowing her to leave the country last week . Devyani Khobragade was charged with visa fraud and making false statements. She faces prosecution if she returns to the States . According to the New York Daily News, Khobragade left the country late Thursday night after being granted diplomatic immunity. 'She is pleased to be returning to her country,' lawyer Daniel Arshack said. 'Her head is held high. She knows she has done no wrong.' Judge Shira Scheindlin granted Khobragade permission to leave the country at a hearing in Manhattan federal court Thursday. If she returns to the country without immunity, she will be prosecuted. In an impassioned statement her former housekeeper Richard revealed how her own desire to return to India had been denied. She also told of the hopes with which she had arrived in the country in the first place. ‘When I decided to come to the United States my hope was to work . for a few years to support my family and then return to India,' said Richard. ‘I . never thought that things would get so bad here, that I would work so . much that I did not have time to sleep or eat or have time to myself. ‘Because of this treatment, I requested that I return to India but that request was denied.’ She went on: ‘I would like to express my appreciation to everyone who has supported me through this process.’ Richard has been supported by Safe Horizon, a victim support agency that promotes justice for victims of crime and abuse in many forms including human trafficking. Avaloy Lanning, Senior . Director of the Anti-Trafficking Program at Safe Horizon applauded the . steps taken by the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New . York for indicting Khobragade on charges of visa fraud and making . false statements in connection with Richard. Richard welcomed the move as a demonstration of how seriously the U.S. government treats labor exploitation. She . said: ‘I hope this case sends a clear message to diplomats and consular . officials that the U.S. will not tolerate the exploitation of workers and . marks the beginning of an increase in prosecution of these cases.’ According to Safe Horizon, Richard's is not an isolated case but one that is ‘tragically common.’ Devyani Khobragade was arrested last . month after being accused of lying on a visa application for her . housekeeper and paying her only $3 per hour . Devyani Khobragade was charged by a . federal grand jury in Manhattan with visa fraud and making false . statements. She was accused of fraudulently obtaining a work visa for her New York City housekeeper. The . indictment said Khobragade had made or multiple false representations . to U.S. authorities, or caused them to be made, to obtain a visa for a . personal domestic worker. She planned to bring the worker to the . United States in September 2012 when she worked at the Consulate General . of India in New York, according to the indictment. Khobragade, . 39, who was India's deputy consul general in New York, maintained her . innocence to accusations that she claimed to pay her Indian maid $4,500 . per month but actually gave her far less than the U.S. minimum wage. Her . arrest last month sparked outrage in India after revelations that she . was strip-searched and thrown in a cell with other criminal defendants . before being released on $250,000 bail. In the dock: An artist's sketch of Devyani Khobragade at her arraignment in Manhattan Federal Court in December . Protesters in the eastern Indian city of Bhubaneswar, burn an effigy of Barack Obama during the international fall-out of Dr Khobragade's domestic dispute . In . a letter to the judge, prosecutors said there was no need for an . arraignment because Khobragade had 'very recently' been given diplomatic . immunity status and left the United States on Thursday. The . letter said the charges will remain pending until she can be brought to . court to face them, either through a waiver of immunity or her return . to the U.S. without immunity status. 'We . will alert the court promptly if we learn that the defendant returns to . the United States in a non-immune capacity, at which time the . government will proceed to prosecute this case and prove the charges in . the indictment,' the letter from the office of U.S. Attorney Preet . Bharara said. In an . unusual statement last month, U.S. Attorney Bharara responded to . what he described as misinformation and factual inaccuracy in the case . by saying Khobragade was accused of creating false documents and lying . to the U.S. government about what she was doing, including hiring a . housekeeper who was working far more than the 40 hours per week she was . contracted to work. A group supporting domestic workers' rights demonstrate across the street from the Indian Consulate General on December 20 in New York . He also . questioned why there was ‘precious little outrage’ about the treatment . of the Indian housekeeper and her husband while there was so much about . the alleged treatment of Khobragade. He . said his office's sole motivation was to uphold the law, protect . victims and hold lawbreakers accountable, ‘no matter what their societal . status and no matter how powerful, rich or connected they are'. These . developments came as it was revealed that a lawsuit filed months ago on . behalf of the housekeeper alleged poor working conditions. Philip Richard, Ms Richard's husband, filed a petition at the High Court in New Delhi in . July saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day. Mr Richard also said the consular . official's father Uttam Khobragade had threatened Mrs Richard's family . saying that he would have them abducted and framed on false drug . charges. In the petition, first seen by Outlookindia.com, . a concerned Mr Richard wrote: 'The treatment of Sangeeta by Devyani . Khobragade is tantamount to keeping a person in slavery-like conditions . or keeping a person in bondage.' The . petition also stated: 'Uttam Khobragade called Sangeeta's family . several times and threatened them that they would have to face dire . consequences if she complains and that he would ruin their future, get . them abducted and frame false charges of drugs against them.' Mr . Richard also wrote that Khobragade had accused his wife of stealing in . front of a U.S. immigration officer but would not provide details of . what the woman took. Mrs Richard's daughter Jennifer also . wrote a letter to U.S. officials saying that her mother was unhappy and . wanted to return to India but the diplomat refused to let her go. Mr Richard's claim was dismissed in July, according to his lawyer, . because the high court claimed 'no jurisdiction on a crime committed on . foreign soil'.","Sangeeta Richard spoke out for the first time today .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Brain Pickering, 63, from Brambles Farm, Middlesbrough, set fire to his home while five of his relatives . were inside . A grandad set fire to his home while his young grandchildren were inside because his wife threatened to go on holiday without him. Brian Pickering, 64, from Brambles Farm, Middlesbrough, deliberately started two fires in September last year while five of his relatives were inside the semi-detached property. The court heard the arson attack had . been a half-hearted suicide attempt by Pickering, who was furious after his wife Margaret threatened to go away without him. It was only through 'good chance' that none of his family died in the blaze, the court was told. Pickering, who suffered burns in the fire, pleaded guilty to arson being reckless as to whether lives were endangered. He was jailed for six years and three months during a sentencing hearing at Teesside Crown Court. Prosecutor Rachel Masters told the court that Mrs Pickering had been downstairs . with their two grandchildren, aged three and five, when her husband deliberately started the fires in their bedroom. At the time, his son Brian junior and his partner Donna Whithead were in bed in the next room. The court heard Mrs Pickering heard a series of bangs and went upstairs, where she saw the bedroom was full of smoke. She and Miss Whithead then ran downstairs to get the children out of the house. Pickering jumped out of the window to escape the fire, before telling his wife: 'I told you years ago that I would never let you leave me'. He was then taken to hospital for treatment. After the incident, Mrs Pickering made a 26-page statement saying that her husband would never harm the grandchildren. The court heard she had struggled to cope with Pickering's behaviour since he quit his job and she believed the arson attack was a suicide attempt which went wrong. Graham Silvester, defending, told the court that the family were traumatised by the incident and his sons had visited him in prison while he was on remand. Pickering set the house alight, pictured left, by starting two fires in the room he shared with his wife Margaret, top right, after she announced she was going on holiday without him . During the hearing, they were also in the public gallery supporting him. Mr Silvester added: 'There was no plan for this. He knows that he has got to spend a period of time in custody. He is ashamed of it.' The Recorder of Middlesbrough Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC told Pickering: 'You started fires being reckless whether the lives of five individuals who were close to your were endangered. 'You set about setting fire to the house and there were two seats of fire. 'I accept that at the time you did that you were suffering from a mental illness in the sense that you were suffering from depression. 'You full well knew that that you were doing. I accept you felt that you were in a desperate state, but that does not excuse or justify the measures that were taken. 'It is only by good chance that the lives of those five individuals were saved. Those lives could well have been lost as a result of your actions.'","Brian Pickering, 64, from Brambles Farm, Middlesbrough, started two fires .

"By . Katy Winter . The annual Pirelli calendar brings together the world's most beautiful women and the fashion industry's most celebrated photographers and stylists in a celebration of the female body. This week Pirelli released images from its hotly anticipated 50th anniversary photoshoot featuring a stellar line-up of supermodels perfectly under-dressed and shot by renowned fashion photographers Patrick Demarchelier and Peter Lindbergh. Over the years its calendars have been designed to raise eyebrows with their provocative imagery featuring very little clothing and OTT hair and make-up design, but for the 2014 shoot the Italian tyre manufacturer has let the talent do the talking by presenting a simple studio shoot feature megastars Alessandra Ambrosio, Helena Christensen, Karolina Kurkova, Alek Wek, Miranda Kerr and Isabeli Fontana dressed in over-sized shirts and jumpers. The 50th anniversary Pirelli calendar features (l-r) Alessandra Ambrosio, Helena Christensen, Karolina Kurkova, Alek Wek, Miranda Kerr and Isabeli Fontana . Peter Lindbergh took this image of the women wearing masculine roll-neck jumpers . The subtle sexiness of the shots is a far cry from previous years calendars which often featured artistic nudity . Launched in 1964, the calendars, . released by Pirelli to a notoriously limited group of exclusive VIP . customers, have featured nearly every top model of the past decades. In keeping with tradition, this year's offerings are incredibly flattering, which isn't difficult when the photographers are able to cherry pick the most beautiful women in the world as the subjects. In one shot Victoria's Angels Alessandra, 32, and Miranda, 30,  pose next to Alek, 36, Karolina, 29, Isabelli, 30 and Helena, 44 in men's white shirts and simple briefs. In another the women ramp up the sex appeal and show off six pairs of endless legs in black basques and corset tops. The shots capture the retro feel of Peter Lindbergh's iconic 90s photographs of the original supermodels, including Cindy Crawford, Linda Evangelista and Naomi Campbell that so captured the time. The long legs of the models, and a flash or two of torso is all the flesh that is exposed this year, but the shots are still provocative and sexy . The pared down styling of the pictures only serves to emphasize the beauty of the supermodels, who range in age from 30 to 44 . A behind the scenes shot shows the girls being prepared for the shoot in New York . While the results of the 2014 celebratory shoot are undeniably sexy, the more discreet feel represents a move away from the more blatant nudity for which the calendar had become famous. A famous shot from the 1984 edition featured four models lying on their stomachs in the ocean, totally naked, with a tyre track in sand across each of their bottoms. Many shots have also shown the models or celebrities baring their breasts or posing provocatively . In the world of Pirelli calenders the photographer is almost as important as the top models that star in them. 'Pirelli is not a job, really. You do what you want. It's very liberating,' Patrick Demarchelier told The Sunday Times Style magazine. His co-creative on the job photographer Peter Lindbergh said: 'About 25 companies have asked me to do a calendar like Pirelli. They want chocolate or machines in the picture. What do I tell them? In English? Why don't you f*** off and ask somebody else?' Karoline Kurkova and Alek Wek sport wild hair in this timeless black and white shot . Miranda Kerr takes a look at the results of a shoot behind the scenes . 1970: Dramatic lighting creates an intense bikinis shot for Francis Giacobetti at Paradise Island in The Bahamas . 1984: This cheeky picture features tyre tracks in sand across four bare derrieres . 1995: A wild-looking Christy Turlington was Miss November . These pictures from 1994 (left) and 2008 (right) embody the sexy and exotic feel for which the calenders have become renowned .","Shot by renowned fashion photographers Patrick Demarchelier and Peter Lindbergh .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Imran Hussain, 27, murdered an 18-year-old student in a random attack - . just 12 days after carrying out a 'trial-run' which police failed to . properly investigate . A murderer who stabbed a gap-year student to death in a random street attack could have been stopped if police had launched a 'thorough and timely' investigation into a similar attack two weeks before, an investigation has found. Gap-year student Kieran Crump-Raiswell, 18, was handing out his CV in Manchester city centre when he was knifed to death in broad daylight by Imran Hussain, 27, in January last year. The assassin walked up to the teenager and stabbed him four times in the chest because he ‘simply wanted to see what it’s like to kill someone’. But a probe by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) found Hussain could have been stopped from committing the fatal attack, if officers had investigated a 'trial-run' that Hussain carried out twelve days earlier. In that attack, the defendant ran up to another stranger in Nottingham and punched him, before driving off in his vehicle. The victim made a note of Hussain's vehicle registration number and reported the incident to police on January 4. But Hussain was not tracked down by police - and was 'emboldened' to carry out the second attack. In its report, the IPCC said the officer who investigated the incident 'did not pursue appropriate lines of inquiry' - despite having the vehicle registration number and a description of the assailant. The officer also failed to properly . handle evidence, keep an adequate record of evidence within his . pocket notebook, promptly create a crime report or keep it adequately updated. Kieran Crump-Raiswell, 18, right, was handing out his CV in Manchester in the hope of finding a job when Hussain stabbed him four times in the chest in front of shocked witnesses . IPCC commissioner Sarah Green said: 'This was a shocking and unprovoked murder of a promising young student. My thoughts are with Kieran’s family and friends at this difficult time. 'We will sadly never know whether a more prompt investigation might have deterred Imran Hussain from going on to commit the grave crime of murder, but it is clear that the officer did not investigate the initial assault quickly and thoroughly enough, despite being provided with clear lines of inquiry. 'There are lessons for Nottinghamshire Police to learn from these events to improve the service they provide in future.' Mr Crump-Raiswell had been accepted to study history at Sheffield Hallam University and had just returned from the US where he had been coaching football when the murder took place. He was heading into Manchester to find a job when he was attacked in front of stunned witnesses. Hussain . was then seen by witnesses to be laughing and sniggering as he ran back . to his car and drove to his student flat in Coventry. The teenager died later the same day in hospital. Kieran's mother Christine Raiswell, right, and Ronald Crump pictured . left, called the murder 'completely senseless' and said it was a . 'random, violent assault' Hussain admitted killing Mr . Crump-Raiswell but claimed it was manslaughter by reason of diminished . responsibility after saying he was responding to voices in his head. He was found guilty of murder after a trial in July last year and was sentenced to a . minimum of 23 years in jail. During the sentencing, Mr . Justice Baker told him: 'I’m satisfied that having escaped detection for . that attack (in Nottingham) you were emboldened to undertake another . one, this time with deadly intent.' After the IPCC findings, Detective Chief Inspector Mick Windmill-Jones said the force accepted the conclusion of the investigation. He said: 'Nottinghamshire Police accepts the IPCC’s recommendations in relation to this case. We will always strive to improve the service we provide to the public. 'Nottinghamshire Police accept that the officer concerned did not conduct a thorough and timely investigation into the assault which occurred in Nottingham. 'The officer in question faced internal misconduct proceedings which were held in March of this year. 'It was found that the officer did not meet the standards of professional behaviour expected from a police officer. 'A finding of misconduct was upheld against the officer who received management action. Our deepest condolences are with Kieran Crump-Raiswell’s family and friends at this time.' After the trial last year, Mr . Crump-Raiswell’s mother, Christine, 45, said: 'It is so completely . senseless. People have said things like he was in the wrong place at the . wrong time, but he wasn’t. 'He . was just walking along enjoying himself and somebody has attacked him. He did not have a chance to do anything. There was no motive. It was . just a random, violent assault.' The watchdog said it also made . recommendations around several gaps identified in Nottinghamshire . Police’s policies and procedures. These . included the use of the violent crime handover policy force-wide; . improved performance reviews and improved communications between . intelligence staff, control room staff and operators.","Imran Hussain, 27, murdered Kieran Crump-Raiswell, 18, in January last year .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Red Bull team principal Christian Horner launched an astonishing tirade against the Formula One media on Friday as he attempted to defend Azerbaijan's forthcoming inclusion on the calendar. Horner, along with his counterparts in Ferrari's Marco Mattiacci, McLaren's Eric Boullier, Vijay Mallya from Force India, Sauber's Monish Kaltenborn and Claire Williams from Williams, faced several tricky questions during the FIA team principals' press conference. When the focus switched towards why Formula One ventures into areas that are suspect given the human rights record of certain countries, including Azerbaijan, Horner turned on his inquisitor, and the F1 press in general. Attack: Christian Horner (centre) launched an astonishing tirade against Formula One media on Friday . 'This is becoming a very depressing press conference where we're focused on the negativities,' said an exasperated Horner. 'Look, there is a calendar that comes out in October and November and we all have a choice whether we enter the world championship or not. 'All the people sitting here are racers and they are here because they are passionate about the sport and want to compete. 'When we sign up for that championship we put our faith and trust in the promoter and the FIA, and we will attend those races unless they deem it unnecessary for us to be there. 'All of you, or the vast majority, will be at those races, and why? Because you are either passionate about the sport or because you earn a living out of covering the sport. On track: Lewis Hamilton in action during Saturday morning's final practice session ahead of qualifying . 'It is wrong to make Formula One a political subject. We are a sport, we should be talking about the drivers in these conferences, about the spectacular racing between our drivers and his driver (pointing to Mattiacci) at the last grand prix (in Germany). 'We should be talking about what a great race it was for Lewis Hamilton to come through the grid. 'Yet all we do is focus on the negatives, and it has to be said, it gets pretty boring for us to sit up here and fend off these questions. 'How about asking some questions about what's going to happen in the race on Sunday, about what's going to happen in qualifying tomorrow. 'If you've got these (other) questions then please point them at Mr (Jean) Todt (FIA president) or Mr (Bernie) Ecclestone rather than the teams.' Azerbaijan joins the calendar in 2016 and has been given the name of Grand Prix of Europe as F1 further expands its reach into the eastern part of the continent given Russia debuts later this year. With Mexico due to return next season after what will be a 23-year absence, the team principals were in agreement the new races were a positive for the sport.","Red Bull team principal lost his cool when asked about the inclusion of Azerbaijan on the F1 calendar .

"By . Mike Dawes . History repeated itself on Monday as England were forced to take Commonwealth Games silver in the team table tennis at Glasgow 2014. Just like in Delhi four years ago, Singapore were their conquerors with the reigning champions taking the gold with a 3-1 victory. Time proved no healer for Andrew Baggaley, Paul Drinkhall and Liam Pitchford as they were beaten at Scotstoun, with a poor start coming back to haunt them. So close: England's (left to right) Liam Pitchford, Paul Drinkhall, Andrew Baggaley, Sam Walker and Danny Reed with their silver medals . Drinkhall had the perfect chance to lay down an early marker as he led Jian Zhan 1-0 and 2-1 but he ended up losing 3-2, before Pitchford was brushed aside 3-0 by Ning Gao. Salvation appeared to be at hand as Baggaley and Drinkhall ripped through their doubles match to make it 2-1 overall but, when Zhan dispatched Baggaley 3-0 in 24 minutes, the game was up. It was not a case of twice bitten thrice shy for Drinkhall, though, who remains intent on cracking the code in the Commonwealth team event. 'We are there or thereabouts, it's just a couple of points either way but we'll be back in four years and this will only make us more determined,' he said. 'This is a much stronger Singapore team than four years ago. They've brought in two new players who were not eligible in Delhi and they really pushed on. Not enough: England star Drinkhall, pictured here playing a shot against Singapore, couldn't help his country to victory at Scotstoun Sports Centre . 'I think we've closed the gap on Singapore. These guys are very experienced, some of them are ex-Chinese national team members. 'We are just getting better and better and while they are coming to the end of their career, we are just starting to peak.' All three English players now head into the singles and doubles competition and Drinkhall is ready for that. 'I'm playing well. I've come into the tournament with confidence. I wasn't playing at my best at the start but I've slowly got into it and I can still get better,' he said. 'I really think there are three medals for me and I really want one of those golds and I believe we can medal in every event. I know we can beat every pair in the doubles.' Champions: Ning Gao and his Singapore team-mates proved too strong for England in the final .","Singapore beat England 3-1 in the final to win gold .

"By . Katy Winter . and Ben Mitchell, Press Association . The Queen’s granddaughter Zara Phillips has spoken of the importance of being an active role-model to her baby daughter as she takes part in a charity sailing race. The 33-year-old equestrian, joined by her husband Mike Tindall, is participating in the Artemis Challenge, a 50-mile race around the Isle of Wight being held as part of Ladies Day at the Aberdeen Asset Management Cowes Week. The couple put on a rare public display of affection before the race, posing for pictures on board the boat with their arms around each other. Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall shared an intimate moment on the bow of Artemis Ocean Racing during the Artemis Challenge . The pair seemed in excellent spirits as they prepared for the  the Artemis Challenge, a 50-mile race around the Isle of Wight being held as part of Ladies Day at the Aberdeen Asset Management Cowes Week . At one point Mike even tenderly planted a kiss on top his wife's head in front of the cameras. She gave birth to her daughter Mia in January and is part of the crew of Artemis Ocean Racing II, skippered by Brian Thompson. Ahead of the race, Zara said that she enjoyed sailing as a different challenge to horse-riding. She said: 'We used to sail as kids, I didn’t come down last year but I have come down to Artemis, the race, probably three or four times. This is probably my fifth race. 'It’s nice to get back on the water and have some fun. Hopefully there will be some wind.' Describing what she liked about sailing, the 2006 BBC Sports Personality of the Year said: 'Being out on the water, making the best decisions to get in front of everyone. It’s great to be part of a team where we can watch everyone working out on the water and using every advantage possible to get in the front of the race.' Speaking to the press Zara said she hoped to give daughter Mia the same sporting opportunities that she and husband Mike had as children . Speaking of the importance of being an active role-model to her daughter, she said: 'I think we have got it off our parents and hopefully we can pass that on to Mia. 'We have always had sport in our lives and through our childhood. I think that really is important in every child’s life to have that opportunity.' Her husband, former England rugby team captain, said: 'She will be whatever she wants to be, we will support that, but realistically we will have to wait and see on that one.' Asked if she was competitive, Phillips answered: 'Yeah, but obviously it’s a day for charity and the Artemis boat is probably heavier than all the other boats and we haven’t won yet. We will see what happens. 'We might be bobbing around sunbathing instead of sailing but it will be nice to get back on the water. Whether we manage enough wind to get round the island, we will see.' The Queen's granddaughter looked perfectly at ease out at sea, though admitted sailing poses different challenges to riding . Zara quickly found her sea legs for the race which  is held as part of Ladies Day at the Aberdeen Asset Management Cowes Week . Zara believes she and Mike inherited their love of sports from their parents - and she wants to pass on that same enthusiasm to their daughter . Tindall, 35, said that although very different sports, sailing and rugby did have their similarities. He said of sailing: 'From what I know, getting on those grinders, it’s not that easy, it can be quite physical, it’s all about teamwork, listening to the skips, it’s one of those where it’s not directly physical but can be. 'I am excited about it, it’s a beautiful day, there’s a bit of wind but not a lot of wind, I am still waiting to race with wind. 'It’s very much a novelty for me, I haven’t really done any before. The only times I have been on a racing boat is when I have done it a couple of times when away with England in Australia and New Zealand. It’s very much a rare thing for me.' The parents of seven-month-old Mia discuss their strategy for the event, which sees them pitted against top racing names . The sun was shining on the team as they headed out to the race start line, hoping to end in possession of the £10,000 charity prize . The winner of the race will receive £10,000 to donate to a charity of their choosing. Phillips and Tindall have chosen Toe in the Water, which helps injured service personnel experience sailing, and the UK Sailing Academy which similarly helps children. Among the competition are Duran Duran frontman Simon Le Bon and his wife Yasmin, who are on Azzam with the crew of Abu Dhabi Ocean Racing, one of the six current challengers for the Volvo Ocean Race 2014/15. Azzam is skippered by one of Britain’s most successful sailors, double Olympic silver medallist Ian Walker. Tindall, who said he had not yet won a sailing race and he was keen to beat the Le Bons, said: 'We haven’t won yet. I would like to get a win under my belt, that’s the competitive nature of myself. The royal couple are part of the crew of Artemis Ocean Racing II, skippered by Brian Thompson. 'He (Le Bon) helped out a couple of times with my charity so I am sure we will meet up and if he beats me, I will throw him in the water.' The Artemis Challenge has a history of celebrity names joining the crews of the fleet of offshore racing yachts, both monohulls and multihulls, taking part. The race follows the classic America’s Cup route around the Isle of Wight, starting at the Royal Yacht Squadron Line at Cowes. The boats will be divided into teams, and the winning team at the end of the 50-mile sprint will win the £10,000 charity prize. The large ocean yachts will also be joined on the start line by the fleet of Artemis Figaro Beneteaus, skippered by some of the brightest future stars of British sailing currently racing as part of the Artemis Offshore Academy, a UK training programme of excellence for British short-handed sailors.","Taking part in Artemis Challenge, a 50-mile race around Isle of Wight .

"By . Lydia Warren . A Texas family is demanding answers from police who responded to their home after its alarm system was activated - and shot dead their beloved dog. Hope and Russell Lane were stunned when Round Rock Police phoned them to say there had been an 'incident' concerning their Rottweiler, Bullet, at their home on Friday. The eight-year-old pet had been shot five times after officers fired seven bullets inside the home. 'I'm just standing here trying to figure out how to start our life over. Without our son, our dog,' Mrs Lane told My Fox Austin. Scroll down for video . Loss: Bullet the Rottweiler was shot dead when police stormed his family's home after its alarm was activated . Shock: One of Bullet's owners, Hope Lane, said the eight-year-old dog had never been aggressive to anyone . The Lanes' granddaughter had forgotten to shut the door all the way after she left for school that morning, leaving the door to blow open and trigger the alarm, KVUE reported. Mr Lane disarmed the alarm from his cell phone at work, but officers still responded to the address. Surveillance footage taken outside the family's home shows one officer cautiously opening the front door before shouting inside and reaching for his gun. Two other officers follow him inside. Round Rock authorities said they came across the 120-pound Rottweiler, who became aggressive toward them. They fired seven bullets. By the time Mrs Lane returned home, Bullet was gone and his blood had been cleaned up. There were bullet holes in the wall and on the couch where he slept. 'I thought my dog would still be there,' she said. 'I may have wanted to bury my dog in my backyard. Who told you to take my dog away?' Response: Surveillance footage outside the home shows responding officers pushing open the front door . Attack: A group of police officers grab their guns and enter the home, where Bullet was shot 5 times . Heading out: The police officers are seen leaving the house after they killed the beloved pet dog . She added that there was a sign outside the home reading, 'Rottweilers on duty'. It is displayed in a front window by the door, but officers said they did not see it. 'I obviously have a sign that I have a dog,' she said. 'You know to be cautious [when you see it].' The couple also insisted that the dog, who suffered from hip dysplasia, was not aggressive. Images of the family on Facebook show him licking the relatives' faces. Officers have met with the family to explain what happened, but the family continues to seek justice and demand that responding officers are better trained to deal with dogs. Round Rock authorities are still investigating the incident. Home: The alarm had been activated when the couple's granddaughter failed to shut the door properly . Evidence: The couple returned home to find Bullet and his blood had gone - but bullet holes still remained . Loved: Bullet, who suffered from hip dysplasia, was a gentle and affectionate dog, his owners said . The Lanes plan to hold a candlelight vigil for Bullet next Saturday night at their home. In a post on the Facebook group, Justice for Bullet, Mr Lane posted a short poem he had written about the dog. 'On Friday I lost a friend, the kind of friend that never complained about where we were going or how long we'd stay,' it read in part. 'We would walk late in the evening and he would sometimes pull me along the way, and at each corner with a wave of my hand he would sit and stay... He loved me unconditionally.'

"By . Travelmail Reporter . A disruptive passenger left 267 passengers stranded in Bali overnight after an in-flight incident. The man became verbally abusive on Flight JQ35, which departed Melbourne at 6pm yesterday and landed in Bali around six hours later. Passengers claim they were told three flight attendants were physically injured in the altercation and required medical attention. Grounded: A Jetstar plane pictured at Melbourne airport . However, a Jetstar spokesman said the abuse was verbal, adding: 'Due to the nature of the incident and in the interest of crew wellbeing' the return flight from Bali to Brisbane was cancelled. All 267 passengers were provided with accommodation in Bali and have been reaccommodated on services departing today. 'Jetstar does not does not tolerate anti-social behaviour,' the spokesman said. 'Our crew are trained to deal with these situations and handled the incident professionally.' The disruptive passenger was denied entry to Indonesia and will be deported. 'Jetstar is liaising with the Australian Federal Police in relation to the incident.' After the incident, a member of crew went off duty, meaning the return flight from Bali to Brisbane was cancelled. Stranded: Bali, where the 267 passengers were stuck after an in-flight incident on a Jetstar plane . As a result, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner flew back empty. Tavis Keen, stuck in Bali with his family, told news.com.au the flight was delayed by one and a half hours before the captain announced three flight attendants were 'incapable of flying back to Brisbane' and had been 'removed from the plane for medical attention'. 'Bear in mind that they waited for nearly two hours after the flight initially should have left to advise the passengers — no doubt waiting for the terminal to be emptied of all other passengers and flights in order to avoid any issues with passengers,' the passenger said. The passenger said Jetstar had provided passengers with a $25 voucher for flights as compensation 'as well as substandard accommodation and absolutely no communication about it'.","Passengers stuck after Jetstar flight from Bali to Brisbane was cancelled .

"By . James Rush . Primed and ready for action, this collection of striking images from the battlefield could be mistaken for authentic photographs taking during World War II. But they are in fact the work of photographer Robert Bridgens, who has spent four years amassing the impressive collection from re-enactment shows across the country. Mr Bridgens, 29, has always been interested in the history of World War II, so much so that he wanted to embark on a project to capture what life was like for the soldiers who went through the conflict through a series of pictures. Action: Photographer Robert Bridgens has amassed a collection of striking images from World War II re-enactments . Danger: The crew of a tank fail to appear fazed as they make their way through a ball of flames . War: The images were taken at a number of re-enactments from across the country . Mr Bridgens began shooting re-enactments with authentic equipment, using a copy of a Leica camera and some Kodachrome film. But when the film ran out he started using a Canon 5DMkII digital camera and learned ways to alter the images to achieve his desired effect. Mr Bridgens said he 'split-tones' the images and manually pushes the red and orange colour . channels in the highlights to give that distinctive warm skin hue. He said: 'In the shadow areas I push the cooler blue and aqua channels. This echoes the distinctive colours of the Kodachrome film but also . allows the subjects of my photos to ""pop"" a little bit as there is more . contrast between them and the background colours.' He said he also reduces the saturation of the blue and green channels to make the sky and green foliage duller. He photographed scenes from events . including The War & Peace Show, in Kent, and The Victory Show, in . Leicester. He now has a gallery of images that are reminiscent of . the atrocious scenes soldiers went through during the war. Mr Bridgens, from Kent, said: 'When I was given the chance to step onto the battlefield that first time I realised that I could use my camera to capture and recreate some of the drama and emotion that the histories speak of. 'Many of my images show the time . spent working on various tasks around camp or the long marches that the . soldiers would have had to have undertaken whilst on patrol. 'I . am always on the lookout for an emotional connection in the shot. Whether that is fear, weariness or happiness, I am looking to convey . that emotion through the images to give a feel of what it might have . been like back then. 'I . know this doesn't come close to the true terror of being in conflict . but I try to convey as much as I can in this fabricated scenario.' Some of the pictures show front-line . conditions with trenches and hastily constructed fortifications, a . rearward command station with officers, medical stations and surgeons. Mr Bridgens came up with the idea after his brother joined a re-enactment group and he was asked to take some pictures for them. He . said: 'They threw some overalls at me and invited me onto the camp and . to take photos from the back of one of the vehicles during a battle. 'From that point I knew that this was something I could make a body of work from and it has been my passion since.' Thousands is spent on high quality . replica equipment and powerful pyrotechnics to make the re-enactments as . realistic as possible. Mr . Bridgens added: 'These re-enactors have a burning passion for history . and use the living history areas to try and teach the public about what . it would have been like to be an Allied or Axis soldier during the war. 'I have often been asked about whether this is glorifying war, but they are truly passionate about educating people.' Explosive: Thousands is spent on high quality replica equipment and powerful pyrotechnics to make the re-enactments as realistic as possible . Re-enactment: A soldier lies wounded in the trench as a crowd watch the re-enactment in the background . Down time: Soldiers are captured relaxing in the realistic war-torn environment . Combat: The pictures capture what some of the atrocities may have been like for soldiers during the Second World War . Just an act: Mr Bridgens photographed scenes from events including The War & Peace Show, in Kent, and The Victory Show, in Leicester .

Armed: A soldier prepares his weapon as his colleagues get ready for combat during a re-enactment . Mr Bridgens said when he started . taking the pictures he was using a copy of a Leica camera, used by . famous war photographers, and some Kodachrome film. But when when the film ran out he switched to digital and now edits the colour of the pictures to create that authentic look. He said: 'I began shooting with a . copy of the famous Leica camera - a popular choice for famous war . photographers like Henri Cartier Bresson and W Eugene smith - and some . out of date Kodachrome film. 'When the film ran out I changed to digital but tried to emulate the look I achieved with the original set up. 'I . now shoot using my Canon 5DMkII and assorted lenses. It allows me to be . flexible and react quickly to what is happening around me. 'Effects-wise . I have based my editing on the colour film images from the late war . period, specifically the Kodachrome film.

'I have tried to emulate this but at . the same time given a slightly cinematic effect of my own. I have had to . purposefully soften the images as the modern equipment I use is just . too sharp. 'When the . images are in perfect focus they lose some of their emotion and look . less dramatic. I think I have come away with something that looks . authentic to the era but has leanings toward a more dramatic cinematic . look.' Mr Bridgens said he 'split-tones' the images and manually pushes the red and orange colour . channels in the highlights to give that distinctive warm skin hue. He said: 'In the shadow areas I push the cooler blue and aqua channels. This echoes the distinctive colours of the Kodachrome film but also . allows the subjects of my photos to ""pop"" a little bit as there is more . contrast between them and the background colours.' He said he also reduces the saturation of the blue and green channels to make the sky and green foliage duller. Passion: Mr Bridgens said the re-enactors 'have a burning passion for history and use the living history areas to try and teach the public about what it would have been like' Ammunition: Mr Bridgens says the re-enactors do not glorify the war, but are passionate about educating people .

Consequences of war: Two soldiers lie dead in a field during a re-enactment (left) while another two soldiers appear to be happy by their supplies of meat and vegetable stew (right) Marching: Soldiers make their way through a field on a march during a re-enactment . He said: 'I then took inspiration from classic war films and added my own cinematic styling to the way the images looked to evoke a more gritty feel.' He went on to say: 'My Canon 5DII and 24-70 lens are a fantastic ccombination but images are too sharp when taken straight from the camera and they subsequently do not look authentic. 'I lower the sharpness of the image slightly and add a rough grain to the image to further soften the shot and give it a bit of an analogue feel of film. 'I always shoot my images in RAW so I have the most latitude to make edits without sacrificing image quality.' He makes most of his adjustments in Adobe Lightroom and has built his own set of preset actions. More heavy duty changes, such as removing electricity pylons, are done using Photoshop.

"By . Steph Cockroft . Miroslav Balog, 32, from Shoebury, Essex, was let off most of his outstanding fines despite a string of shoplifting offences . Having only one arm didn’t hold back Miroslav Balog in his chosen profession – shoplifting. In fact, he accumulated more than £900 in fines by stealing from seafront traders  in Essex. So understandably, local business owners were outraged when the serial thief, 32, was let off paying almost £860 of it – on the condition that he spent the day on court premises. Instead of a more traditional punishment, Balog was simply forced to stay until 5pm at Southend Magistrates’ Court, where he was free to wander around the concourse and eat in the cafeteria. Paul Thompson, chairman of Southend Seafront Traders’ Association, said: ‘That is not a deterrent. It is carte blanche for him to carry on offending. ‘Serial offenders are given a soft touch approach and ordinary hard-working people lose out because these criminals are getting off scot-free. It’s ridiculous. ‘These people waste police time. Police do their job, but unfortunately the courts put the offenders back on the street. ‘What will happen if he’s in there again? Will we start giving him money?’ Balog, a Czech heroin addict with no left arm, appeared in court this week to admit his latest crimes – stealing £178 worth of meat from the Co-op in Southend between February and April. He was handed a 12-month conditional discharge and initially told to pay £87 in compensation. But when magistrates heard that he still owed £904 for previous offences, they decided to ‘give him another opportunity to turn his life around’ by waiving nearly all of his outstanding fines. Chairman of the bench Robert Smale said he would write off £859 of the unpaid charges if Balog agreed to stay on court grounds until 5pm. The defendant was given the chance by . magistrates to spend the rest of the day on the grounds of Southend . Magistrates' Court, in return for an £859 outstanding fine being waived . Balog agreed, and will now only have . to pay £87.66 compensation for the meat thefts, as well as £45 for one . of his previous offences. The . court heard the unemployed father of three, of Shoebury, Essex, feared . he would be deported to the Czech Republic if he continued to commit . crimes. He claimed to be working hard to change his life and had asked . to serve time in prison last year to try to come off drugs, the . magistrates were told. Michelle . Breindel, mitigating, said Balog had promised to turn over a new leaf, . adding: ‘I said to him, “You have no money, will you go and shoplift to . support your family?” He said, “No, we will have to manage with what we . have.”’ Mr Smale told . Balog: ‘We have heard you are turning your life around. You have another . opportunity to do so – make sure you take it.’ A . spokesman for the Courts and Tribunals Judiciary said: ‘We do not . comment on judges’ and magistrates’ sentencing decisions, other than to . say they sentence on the facts of each case and within guidelines.’","Miroslav Balog, 32, from Shoebury, owed court £904 in outstanding fines .

"By . Claire Ellicott . Youngest ever: At just 17, MArtha is the youngest ever Bake Off contestant, and says 'my head is always in the kitchen' While her classmates are up to their eyes in revision and coursework, schoolgirl Martha is up to her elbows in cake mix – as the Great British Bake Off returns. The 17-year-old is the youngest contestant ever to join the programme, which begins its fifth series in a new slot on BBC One next week. The pupil from Berkshire said: ‘I may be in school, but my head is always in the kitchen.’ She will be battling it out for the show’s title with rivals including a former Merchant Navy man, a barefoot runner and a part-time beekeeper – as well as 69-year-old Diana, the oldest ever contestant. And in a bid to whet our appetites for the new series, producers have lifted the lid on some of the Bake Off’s secret ingredients, which include runners stationed at supermarkets, Victoria sponge oven tests and 160 hours of washing up. Insiders also admitted they were nervous following the last year’s ‘carnage’, when a number of contestants injured themselves with sharp knives. ‘We have new knives every year, and the knives are … good,’ the show’s home economist Faenia Moore said. ‘If [the contestants] are nervous and used to using crummy knives at home, and cutting, and talking to camera, I have to say: “Please watch your fingers.” ‘Last year it was carnage, but this year it’s been injury-free.’ The show has its own washer-upper who cleans every piece of equipment by hand because dishwashers are too noisy during filming. Iva Vcelak got through 1,000 cloths, 80 sponges and 30 litres of washing-up liquid during 160 hours at the sink this year. Producers also revealed that before each series, a dozen Victoria sponge mixes are prepared and cooked just to check each oven is working properly. Fraternising is also strictly off the menu, with judges put up in different hotels to the contestants to maintain a professional distance. And if you think baking decent fairy cakes will be enough to qualify for the show, think again. The military-style whittling-down operation involves an enormous 16,000 hopefuls and includes a lengthy application form, an interview, auditions and a baking screen test. ‘It is a huge process for us to get to the final 12,’ executive producer Anna Beattie told Radio Times. ‘We usually have two standbys, just in case someone pulls out at the last minute or is ill. But only for the first show or two. Then we are up and running.’ Gang's all here: All twelve contestants pose above in the kitchen. Martha is pictured centre while Diana, the oldest ever contestant at 69, is third from the left in yellow . Producers also revealed the extraordinary lengths the behind-the-scenes staff go to in ensuring the show bubbles along smoothly. On filming days a runner is stationed at the nearest big supermarket, just in case contestants make any last-minute amendments to their recipes. ‘If our bakers want rose petals from Kensington or cheese from Devon, we will get it for them,’ Miss Moore added. ‘I come equipped with duct tape and a marker pen so I can blank out the product name, since there must be no advertising in the show.’ The series starts on Wednesday, August 6, at 8pm on BBC One. There will also be a spin-off show called Extra Slice on BBC Two.","Pupil from Berkshire is youngest-ever contestant on the show, and will face Diana, 69, the oldest to ever compete .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . What’s that about Valhalla being a burial ground for legends? Maybe in Norse mythology, but clearly not for those of the golfing kind. To general astonishment and a fair level of hysteria, Tiger Woods showed up here in the nick of time on Wednesday and played the most watched nine-hole practice round in the history of the game. Was this the man who could barely lift himself off a buggy after withdrawing from the WGC Bridgestone Invitational on Sunday — the one whose hopes looked buried amid his latest injury setback? Fair play to his physio. Whatever he gets paid, he is worth it. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tiger Woods say 'he feels good' ahead of US PGA Championship . Walk and talk: Tiger Woods, left, walks on the seventh hole with his swing coach Sean Foley . On track: Woods hits an approach shot during a practice round prior to the start of the 96th PGA Championship . Fighting fit: Woods arrives at Valhalla for his PGA Championship practice round . Smooth: The American golfer looked calm in his preparations, intent on recovering from injury . Like the last major at Hoylake, the USPGA will finish with an exciting par-five where it’s possible to score anything from an eagle to a double bogey. A vast amphitheatre behind the green can accommodate thousands of spectators with the entire hole visible. Reachable in two but well protected by a lagoon that runs its whole length and a deep bunker at the front of a devilish horseshoe green. Woods was in such good spirits he even spoke at length with the media before walking the back nine. ‘The only good thing about Sunday night was that I knew the pain was in a different place from where I had my surgery,’ he said. ‘What had happened is that the sacrum (a triangular bone at the base of the spine) had popped out and pinched a nerve. Once my physio popped it back in the pain went away. ‘I feel good. I feel fit and yes, I think I can win.’ Asked if there was a danger it could pop out again, he replied: ‘Sure. But you won’t find me jumping back into bunkers any more.’ Woods didn’t play in the Ryder Cup here in 2008 because he was recovering from yet more injuries — his knee and a broken leg on that occasion — but it sounded like a Ryder Cup when he walked to the practice ground. He hit a 20-yard chip and 10,000 people started cheering. Whatever happens to him over the coming months as he strives for a decent level of fitness, there will clearly be no shortage of people wishing him well. After warming up with a little pitching and a few short irons, he reached for the driver. Uh-oh. But he swung fairly hard and not only did it go straight, he didn’t collapse on his haunches. Steve Stricker, fresh from being chosen as one of Tom Watson’s Ryder Cup vice-captains, Medinah skipper Davis Love and young American Harris English accompanied Woods alongside the madding hordes — and that was just the media inside the ropes, wondering if they could trust their eyes. Empty space: There were doubts the former world number one would make it to Valhalla . Woods took a three-wood off the first tee and struck it true. The same with his iron approach and again at the second hole. At the third he played his first bunker shot in public since jarring his back while tumbling into the sand last Sunday. But that went well too. He splashed out and holed the three-foot putt. Beware the injured golfer? We will find out soon enough, given he is out this morning at 8.35 (1.35pm UK time) in the company of two more greats struggling to keep pace — Padraig Harrington and Phil Mickelson. ‘I think you saw out there that my speed through the ball is pretty good,’ said Woods. ‘It’s nice coming back to a place where I won (the 2000 PGA) but the greens are completely different so all my notes are of no use.’ The presence of Stricker was surely telling. People can say what they like about Woods and the Ryder Cup, but one of the reasons Woods is playing is surely to try to prove his health for Gleneagles, and find some semblance of form. Take it as read that Stricker will be like a personal captain for him. Woods admitted he wished he had been able to play a full practice round. Then again, given where he was on Sunday evening, it seems truly amazing that he’s here at all. Wherever you look, then, the game is certainly keeping us on the edges of our seats right now, isn’t it? Can’t wait for 8.35am. VIDEO WGC-Bridgestone Invitational Day 4 highlights .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Pope Francis sacked the five-man board of the Financial Information . Authority who were associated with the discredited financial old guard . Pope Francis has sacked the five-man 'old boy network' board of the Vatican's financial watchdog, in the latest bid to break with the discredited old guard, which existed under his predecessor. The Vatican said the pope chose four experts from Switzerland, Singapore, the United States and Italy to replace the five Italians on the board of the Financial Information Authority (AIF), the Holy See's internal regulatory office. The new board includes a woman for the first time and has a broad range of international experience. All five outgoing members, who were laymen associated with the Vatican's old guard, had expected to serve five-year terms until 2016. The new board includes Marc Odendall, who administers and advises philanthropic organisations in Switzerland, and Juan C. Zarate, a Harvard law professor who is also a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank based in Washington D.C. The other two board members are Joseph Yuvaraj Pillay, former managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore and senior advisor to the country's president, and Maria Bianca Farina, the head of two Italian insurance companies. The move comes as reformers inside the Vatican pushed for the pope to appoint professionals with an international background. They . wanted the professionals to work with Rene Bruelhart, a Swiss . lawyer who heads the AIF and has been pushing for change. Vatican . sources said Bruelhart, Liechtenstein's former top anti-money . laundering expert, also wanted Francis to appoint global professionals . like him to help drive the authority forward. A Vaatican source said: 'Bruelhart wanted a board he could work . with and it seems the pope has come down on his side and sent the old . boy network packing.' Francis, who was elected in March 2013 after the resignation of former Pope Benedict, has said the finances of the Vatican need to be reformed for the Church to have credibility. He set up a new Secretariat for the Economy in February, which reports directly to him and appointed an outsider, Australian Cardinal George Pell, to head it. In another telling move, Sir Francis removed Cardinal Attilio Nicora as president of the AIF in January, despite him having played a senior role in Vatican finances for more than a decade. He replaced him with an archbishop who has a track record of reform within the Vatican bureaucracy. He also replaced four of the five cardinals in the commission that supervises the Vatican's troubled bank, known as the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR). The Vatican announced that four experts from Switzerland, Singapore, the . US and Italy - including one woman for the first time - would replace . the five outgoing Italians, who had been due to serve on the board until . 2016 . Since the arrival of Bruelhart in 2012, the AIF has been spearheading reforms to bring the Vatican in line with international standards on financial transparency and money laundering. Pope Francis has already taken steps to clear up Vatican . finances since he was appointed in March 2013 after the resignation of . Pope Benedict, above . But Vatican sources say he has encountered resistance from an old, entrenched guard. A report last December by Moneyval, a monitoring committee of the Council of Europe, said the Vatican had made significant reforms but still had to show more oversight over its bank. Pope Francis decided against closing the IOR but only on condition that reforms, including closing accounts by people not entitled to have them, continued. Only Vatican employees, religious institutions, orders of priests and nuns and Catholic charities are allowed to have accounts at the bank. But investigators have found that a number were being used by outsiders, or that legitimate account holders were handling money for third parties. Monsignor Nunzio Scarano, a former senior Vatican accountant who had close ties to the IOR, is currently on trial accused of plotting to smuggle millions of dollars into Italy from Switzerland in a scheme to help rich friends avoid taxes. Scarano has also been indicted on separate charges of laundering millions of euros through the IOR. Paolo Cipriani and Massimo Tulli, the IOR's director and deputy director, who resigned last July after Scarano's arrest, have been ordered to stand trial on charges of violating anti-money laundering norms .","Board has vast international experience and includes a woman for first time .

The best friends ended up on the same maternity ward at and within two hours and 13 minutes were celebrating the births of two bouncing baby boys . But pair were stunned when they both fell pregnant within a couple of months of each other after 28 years of friendship. And they never expected their babies to be born almost side-by-side when they almost simultaneously went into labour last Monday. The pals ended up on the same maternity ward at Nottingham City Hospital and within two hours and 13 minutes of each other were celebrating the births of two bouncing baby boys. Victoria's baby George was born two days early at 12.41pm, weighing 8lbs 5oz. Kelly followed with her late operation going to plan and baby Charlie arrived at 2.54pm, four days early, weighing 7lbs 7oz.

Boots worker Victoria added: 'We never thought it would actually happen on the same day - although we did have a joke about it, saying how funny it would be. 'She was just a short walk away on the ward and pretty much next door to me - we went and introduced the babies to each other the following day. 'We are very close - like sisters and went to nursery, school and college together. 'I just hope our children will have the same relationship because that would be really nice.' Kelly, who works as an invoice administrator, was scheduled to go into theatre to have a cesarean section on the day - but was told it was going to be put back. At the time she had no idea the delay was because her best friend was jumping the queue and stealing her slot. City Hospital, Nottingham, where the best friends gave birth just hours apart .

"By . Tamara Cohen . and Matt Chorley . Families will have to prove their child¿s vaccination records are up to date to qualify for handouts, said Labour MP Jon Cruddas . Parents should lose their child benefit if they refuse to immunise their children with the MMR jab, a senior Labour MP has suggested. Families will have to prove their child’s vaccination records are up to date to qualify for handouts, said Jon Cruddas, who is leading the party’s policy review. The MP for Dagenham & Rainham suggested the measure, which is already in place in Australia, could be a way to link behaviour with state benefits and services. However, Labour rushed to dissociate itself from the idea last night, saying ‘it is not part of the policy review’. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: 'There is no question of a Labour government ever taking child benefit away or punishing parents for choices they make on vaccinations. 'I don't know where that came from. It is not our policy. It is on the front of the newspapers but it is not true. 'We would never say child benefit is conditional on taking a jab,' he told ITV's Daybreak. The idea emerged after the uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine has dropped to dangerously low levels in some areas. The risks were underlined earlier this year when more than 1,000 people caught measles in Swansea. One victim, a man aged 25, died. A senior party source said: ‘This is an example of the sort of measure which we want to see that ties public goods to how people behave as citizens.’ When he was still in power this summer, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced that people who did not immunise their children would be denied some benefits to boost vaccination rates for diseases such as whooping cough and measles. Exemptions would only be made on religious or medical grounds, he said. Controversy has surrounded the MMR vaccine since the 1990s, when it was wrongly linked to autism in a now discredited study by the scientist Andrew Wakefield, published in The Lancet journal. Dr Wakefield, who was struck off over the scandal, said officials had appeared to be more concerned about protecting the MMR programme than they were about protecting children. John Cruddas, the MP for Dagenham & Rainham, suggested the measure, which is already in place in Australia, could be a way to link behaviour with state benefits and services . He wrote on a website that in 1998, following an analysis of studies of the safety of the vaccine, he recommended the use of single measles vaccine in preference to the combined MMR jab. ‘This remains my position,’ he said. In 2001, Tony Blair faced criticism after he refused to disclose whether his son Leo was vaccinated with the MMR jab. Although the Blairs hinted that Leo had been immunised, the former prime minister’s move to keep the decision a secret was blasted as it came at a time when there were public doubts over the safety of the vaccine. It was not until seven years later in 2008 Cherie Blair confirmed in her autobiography Speaking for Myself that Leo had in fact been vaccinated. Babies under six months cannot have the MMR vaccine. They usually have some antibodies passed on from their mother.","Family would have to prove vaccination before handouts, says Cruddas .
Part of drive to link public goods to changing the behaviour of citizens .
But Labour quickly distanced itself from the idea of linking jabs to benefits ."

"By . Alan Hall . A state government in Germany has stopped the distribution of thousands of calendars and ordered their destruction after discovering the cover photo was an idyllic shot of Hitler deputy Hermann Goering's country home. Goering - Luftwaffe chief, founder of the Gestapo and a key architect of the programme to exterminate the Jews - also held the title of chief huntsman in the Third Reich. He entertained lavishly at a hunting estate called Carinhall 50 miles north of Berlin during WW2. The lodge pictured was part of Goering's hunting estate - the rest of which was blown up as the Soviets approached in 1945 . Carinhall was blown up on his orders when the Soviets approached in 1945. But several buildings survived, including a half-timbered, thatched lodge which appeared on the front of a calendar produced by the agricultural ministry of the state of Brandenburg. When it was pointed out who the previous owner was the ministry went into overdrive to pulp the calendars. The intention was to promote forestry in the depressed region north of the capital - but the association with a mass murderer of the Nazis was too much. The ministry admitted that the accompanying text to the photo was ‘insenstive,’ missing out on any mention of Goering's crimes.

Alabama has struck down a medical malpractice lawsuit claiming that a disabled Birmingham man went down for a circumcision but woke up to find his penis had been amputated. In his suit, Johnny Lee Banks Jr., 56, says he was receiving treatment at the Princeton Baptist Medical Center late July when the routine procedure was to take place. The double amputee, who was undergoing a series of surgeries, said he woke up the next day and his privates had been chopped down to about one inch, WBRC reported. But attorneys for the hospital on Thursday asked a Jefferson County judge to dismiss the case because Bank's lawyer, John Graves, failed to review any of his client's medical records. Instead, hospital attorney Mike Florie said . Banks has a history of 'diabetic wet gangrene,' which led to dead . tissue accumulation in the patient's lower extremities, according to AL.com. 'Botched:' A judge in Alabama has struck down a patient's medical malpractice lawsuit against Princeton Baptist Medical Center after his lawyer failed to review the man's medical records . The attorneys — who also represent two doctors and the clinics Urology Centers of Alabama and Simon-Williamson — said that Banks failed to provide a 'detailed specification and factual description' of the incident, according to WBRC. 'I know there are strong feelings on both . sides,' Jefferson County Circuit Judge Jim Hughey III said in court, AL.com reported. 'It is just what the law requires.' In court on Thursday, Banks grunted audibly when lawyers for the hospital said there was no physical evidence that penis had been amputated, according to local reports. His wife Zelda, 55, is also suing for loss of consortium due to the botched operation. Graves can refile his case within 30 days if he finds enough evidence to substantiate his claims. He says the physical evidence in his case should be enough. The 'proof is in the pudding,' he told AL.com. 'Looks like I've got to get back to the drawing board and refile my complaint,' the attorney added. In his lawsuit, Banks says he has been left in extreme pain and has spent additional time recovering in the hospital. Banks, who does not work due to a disability, was seeking an unspecified dollar amount in the suit.","Johnny Lee Banks Jr., 56, claims he went down for the routine procedure but woke up without his privates .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . A leaping frog made an appearance at Nasa’s launch of the LADEE spacecraft last week. The adventurous amphibian was spotted jumping up in the air as the spacecraft took off from the Virgina launchpad on its mission to the moon. It is not yet known whether the frog wanted to hitch a ride, get its 15 minutes of fame, or was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Scroll down for video... The unlucky amphibian was snapped silhouetted against a cloud of smoke as the LADEE lifted off from the Wallops facility in Virginia, U.S. According to NBC News, the frog may have come from a pool of water at the Wallops launch facility potentially created by high pressure sprinkler systems to prevent fires. A Nasa spokesperson said: ‘The photo team confirms the frog is real and was captured in a single frame by one of the remote cameras used to photograph the launch. ‘The condition of the frog, however, is uncertain.’ An Air Force Minotaur V rocket, built by Orbital Sciences Corp, provided the ride from Nasa¿s Wallops Flight Facility . What Brian the bat's thoughts were when he settled on the space shuttle Discovery will never be known but it is probably safe to assume that being blasted into space at 17,500mph was not among them. In 2009, the free-tailed bat stowaway had latched himself onto the shuttle's external fuel tank several hours before countdown.  Every now and then he shifted position. Brian  was seen still attached to mission STS-119 as it cleared the tower and accelerated to 17,500mph in eight minutes. The Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), pronounced 'LA'-dee,' is taking a roundabout path to the moon, making three huge laps around Earth before getting close enough to go into lunar orbit. An Air Force Minotaur V rocket, built by Orbital Sciences Corp., provided the ride from Nasa’s Wallops Flight Facility. This isn’t the first time an animal has photo bombed a space launch. In 2009, Brian the bat clung to the side of the space shuttle as it blasted into space at 17,500mph. LADEE, which is the size of a small car, is expected to reach the moon on October 6.","The frog was spotted as the LADEE spacecraft took off from Virgina .

"By . Joe Strange . Follow @@Joe_Strange . Paul Scholes was only seen in the red of Manchester United during his glittering playing career, but the former midfielder has finally got his hands on a new shirt. The 39-year-old has been pictured showing off the 2014/15 away kit of Oldham Athletic - the team he has supported since he was a young boy. The League One side shared an image of their most famous fan holding their bright new shirt on Instagram, along with the caption: 'Football legend Paul Scholes has got his new Latics away shirt - have you got yours? #oafc' VIDEO Scroll down to watch Paul Scholes score from in his own half in charity match . Fresh start? Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes poses with Oldham Athletic's new away shirt . New venture: Scholes, pictured watching Salford City take on Stalybridge Celtic with Phil Neville, part owns the semi-professional club . Game over: Scholes hung up his boots in 2013 after an illustrious career at Old Trafford . Scholes, who helped coach the Red Devils' first team when Ryan Giggs was placed in temporary charge towards the end of last season, spent his entire career at Old Trafford before retiring in 2013. But he has always had a strong affection for the Latics and often travels to Boundary Park to watch the Football League side in action. The ex-England international also linked up with Oldham boss Lee Johnson late last year to help coach his boyhood side, with the art of pinpoint long passes and unstoppable volleys sure to have been on his agenda. Johnson admitted that the door would always be open for Scholes to put his boots back on and star in the Latics' midfield if he fancied dropping down a couple of divisions. Experienced: Scholes help coach United's first team along with Neville (centre) and Nicky Butt (right) at the back end of last season . Option: Oldham boss Lee Johnson has left the door open for Scholes to sign for the League One club . 'I’m sure if he fancied it he’d have let us know by now,' Johnson said in December last year. ‘I respect Paul Scholes enough to not ask him but Simon (Corney - Oldham chairman) will get in the mix of anything. ‘You’re talking about a world class player that’s retired after a world class career. Why would he want to spoil that adulation by playing for me? ‘Listen – the door’s open. Even to Maradona. I’m sure I could get him 10 minutes.’","Oldham posted a picture of Scholes holding their new away shirt on Instagram .

"By . Phil Medlicott, Press Association Sport . Nicky Butt expects Manchester United to be challenging for the Barclays Premier League title this season. The sense of optimism around United is growing as the 2014/15 top-flight campaign draws ever nearer, with new manager Louis van Gaal having come in and so far seen his team emerge victorious from all five of their pre-season friendlies. The Red Devils are looking to bounce back after the debacle of 2013/14, when they struggled under David Moyes and finished seventh in the table - a year on from being crowned champions in Sir Alex Ferguson’s last season in charge. VIDEO Scroll down for Nicky Butt: We have to use our brains more than our bodies . Excited for the new season: Nicky Butt is a huge fan of the club and expects them to be challenging . And Butt, the former United midfielder who was part of the coaching staff last term and is again this season, is in optimistic mood ahead of the club’s Premier League opener against Swansea at Old Trafford a week on Saturday. The 39-year-old said: 'The new manager is in charge now, we are on an unbeaten run and now we are looking to make a good start to the season with the first five games we have got (Swansea, Sunderland, Burnley, QPR and Leicester). 'Everyone expects Manchester United to contend for the title. 'We finished as low as we have done last season, but when the season starts again, everyone will expect. I am a fan, and I will expect us to be challenging again.' Butt, a United player from 1992 to 2004, knows the strong desire within the club to respond after disappointing periods and has no doubt there will be that kind of feeling in the dressing room at the moment. Great presence: Nicky Butt says Louis van Gaal has an aura about him . Huge desire and success: Nicky Butt says there are similarities between Sir Alex Ferguson and Louis van Gaal . 'It (that desire) is immense,' Butt said. 'In days gone by it has sometimes been when Man United are at their strongest - when they have had setbacks. 'We were always told in no uncertain terms that you had to step up to the plate, otherwise you were not going to be at the club for very much longer. 'I’m sure the new man in charge will say the same thing to the players. Hopefully the players will react, and I’m sure they will.' Butt worked with United’s youth set-up last term and asked about his current role under Van Gaal he said: 'It is a bit of a wider remit now - I’m looking over all age groups. But that needs to be finalised in the next few weeks.' Back in action: Nicky Butt played for a Class of '92 and Friends team against Salford City . The famous class of '92 team: Nicky Butt stands alongside Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Gary and Phil Neville and Paul Scholes . Then asked for his impressions so far of the Dutchman, Butt said: 'Positive. He is obviously a very in-control man. 'He has an aura about him - when he walks in the building, you know who the boss is, and I think that is very important. 'We had that with Sir Alex for all those years and I think we have that now with Van Gaal. He walks into the building and he commands your respect. 'All the players look up to him as the leader and that is how it should be. From afar, when I’ve looked at him it looks like he takes no messing about and if anyone doesn’t toe the line, I’m sure they will be out of the team.' Butt was speaking at the AJ Bell Stadium, where he, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, and Gary and Phil Neville rolled back the years as they lined up together in a ‘Class of 92 and friends’ XI for a friendly against Salford City, the non-league outfit they bought between them this year. Confident: Wayne Rooney enjoyed a brilliant pre-season in the US and is excited for the new campaign . The quintet went on to enjoy trophy-laden careers with United after all graduating from the club’s academy in the early 1990s - something Butt thinks is unlikely to be replicated. 'It is possible - there are a lot of great young players out there,' the ex-England international said. 'But we just need to give them a chance. We had a manager in charge and a club that believed in that, but it is harder now with the immediacy of it all. Everyone wants things instantly. 'Owners that come in don’t necessarily know a lot about football - they just know a lot about business, unfortunately. But that’s the way football is. People don’t have the foresight to wait and see. 'To be fair, managers come in now and why should they go four or five nights a week looking at academies when nine times out of 10 they are not going to be there to see the rewards? 'I think good lads, top players, will still come through. But whether you will get five or six through together is something I doubt. 'We played together since we were 12, 13. To prepare lads to come through takes a lot of patience and a good owner to say to a manager ‘we are going to give you time and stand by you’. 'Unfortunately, for whatever reason, it doesn’t happen now.'","Man Utd coach says there is an air of optimism around Old Trafford .
