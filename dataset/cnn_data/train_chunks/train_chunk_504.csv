New Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt became the third cabinet member to be booed by the Paralympic crowd today. The former Secretary for Culture, Media and Sport was met with loud jeers when he presented Britain’s Rachel Morris with a bronze in the women’s cycling road race. Earlier this week, Chancellor George Osborne and Home Secretary Theresa May were greeted in the same manner when presenting medals to Paralympic winners. Mr Hunt, who was promoted to his new role in this week’s Cabinet reshuffle, seemed unfazed by hostile reception and smiled when he handed out the medals at the Brands Hatch track in Longfield, Kent. Medallist Rachel Morris and fellow Brit Karen Darke had earlier tried to cross the finishing line by holding hands, ensuring they each received a bronze medal at Brands Hatch. But officials refused to oblige, and it was Morris alone who collected the bronze from Mr Hunt. One onlooker said: ‘Hunt arrived to present the bronze medal to the British athlete and the crowd started booing him.' Race: Brits Karen Darke, left, and Rachel Morris during the Women's Individual H 1-3 Road Race . In it together: The pair tried to cross the line holding hands so they would both receive a bronze medal from Jeremy Hunt, but the attempt was disqualified . ‘The medal ceremony itself was on the track, and there were a lot of people there to watch it. But Hunt just seemed to get on with it.’ The Health Secretary can seek solace in not being alone to incur the wrath of the Paralympic crowd. On Wednesday Theresa May was met with loud booing as she presented the medals for the men’s T20 1500m, won by Peyman Bazanjan of Iran. Two days earlier, Chancellor Osborne was also given a hostile reception at the men’s T38 400m medal ceremony. Jeered: Jeremy Hunt is not alone, earlier this week both George Osborne and Theresa May were met with disapproval from the Paralympic crowd . Mr . Osborne initially laughed as the jeering at the 80,000-seater Olympic . Stadium erupted, but seemed to become embarrassed as it continued. It . appeared spectators at the London 2012 Games were determined to deliver . their verdict on the coalition Government with the Prime Minister also . meeting a less-than-enthusiastic reception. While David Cameron presented Ellie Simmonds with her gold medal for the SM6 200m individual medley, some members of the crowd booed the Prime Minister but they were drowned out by cheers for the Paralympic poster girl. Sharing is caring: Rachel Morris, left, bites her bronze medal with team mate Karen Darke who came in fourth in today's race at Brands Hatch . It prompted Lord Coe to defend the move to invite politicians to present medals, saying they should expect to become ‘pantomime villains’. He said: ‘There are 500 medal ceremonies, we require over 1,000 people, not just politicians, and from time to time, I know from my own personal experience, you do become the pantomime villain in politics. ‘I don’t think that we should read too much into that and I think it’s really important that politicians have been seen supporting the two greatest sporting events in our lifetimes. ‘Politicians are bold enough and brave enough to know that sometimes that is the landscape that they are in.’","Presented bronze medal to Britain's Rachel Morris in women's cycling .

A 76-year-old drug dealer who flew to France in his own plane to transport cocaine to sell on the streets of the UK has been jailed for 18 years. George Evans, from Stevenage, ran a 'sophisticated and commercial' operation which earned him and his wife Anne hundreds of thousands of pounds. Ben Gumpert, prosecuting, told the court how the illegal dealing came to light in March 2010 when Evans was kidnapped and tortured by a gang who have never been caught. George Evans' cocaine smuggling was only revealed after he was captured and tortured by a gang. He and his wife Anne Evans were sentenced today . The men drilled a hole into his foot, which they filled with glue, and electrocuted him on parts of his body over a number of days before throwing him on to the A6. His 53-year-old wife had reported him missing, prompting police to search his house, where they found a stash of the drug-cutting agent benzocaine. They also found a quantity of cocaine in a store unit in Bartford. Police later became aware of a car registered in his name found with a stash of cocaine inside it in France and arrested the couple, Mr Gumpert added. The driver, Brian Smith, was detained in a French prison for nine months before being brought back to the UK where he was found to be an innocent victim of the operation, unaware of the stash he was transporting. The court heard how Evans transported drugs from France to England where he stored them at his home before mixing them and selling them on the streets. Police later became aware of a car registered in his name found with a stash of cocaine inside it in France and arrested the couple driving it, although they were later found not to be involved . Throughout the operation he transferred more than £300,000 into his wife's bank account and was found to have bought his house, worth more than £500,000, with cash. The court heard how Mrs Evans, who now lives in High Road, Beeston, Bedfordshire, was not involved in the operation but was aware the cash she was receiving into her account was criminal property. Judge Barbara Mensah told the couple: '(Judges) see the effects of drug dealing and both of you, to different extents, played your part in it. 'Mr Evans, you sold class A drugs on the market so others could suffer from addiction that is caused by it. 'Mrs Evans, you were prepared to assist with it. 'This was a sophisticated and commercial operation. Mr Evans you went overseas to purchase drugs in substantial quantities using your own vehicle or aircraft.' She added that those who take up drug dealing in later life can still expect harsh sentences. George Evans, whose cocaine smuggling operation was revealed after he was tortured by a gang for days, was sentenced at Luton Crown Court, pictured, today . Evans was sentenced to 18 years for conspiracy to supply class A drugs at Luton Crown Court today. They received 18 months each for acquiring criminal property and another 18 months for converting criminal property, to be served concurrently. Both must serve at least half of their sentence. The couple were convicted by a jury in July. The court heard how the couple had problems in their marriage but attempted to stay together for the sake of their 16-year-old son, who must now live with family friends while his parents serve their sentences. Mr Evans will be at least 85 at the first opportunity he can be released.","George Evans, from Stevenage, ran a 'sophisticated and commercial' operation, earning hundreds of thousands of pounds .

The 'Little Spinners' sessions have been added to the timetable at a Canadian fitness studio, alongside 'Flexy Sexy' and 'Babes on Bikes' classes. Instructor Kristy Craig has insisted the classes are focused on fitness and that children are not taught any 'sexual moves', but a child psychologist has warned that parents should be conscious of pole dancing's association with stripping and the sex industry. Girls and boys aged between five and 12 have already been enrolled in the controversial classes at the Twisted Grip Dance and Fitness studio in Duncan, British Columbia. Craig, a certified fitness and aerobics instructor, said she introduced the classes in response to demand from her adult clients. 'My existing students were asking about it for their children,' she told the National Post. 'They were saying: ""My daughter plays on my pole at home all the time. I'd love her to actually learn how to do things properly and not hurt herself."" 'They have no association with it or think there is anything wrong or bad about it. That's an adult putting that on them,' she said. The instructor said the classes were focused on the gymnastic and circus acrobatic elements of pole dancing, and that girls and boys attending the sessions were not taught 'adult' moves. 'I treat it just like gymnastic classes,' she said, adding: 'This is strictly about fitness.' But child psychologist Derek Swain told CTV News he feared introducing young girls to pole dancing could make them more likely to join the sex industry in later life. 'There would be that potential and that is something of concern because we know that people in the adult industry are out recruiting in colleges and universities, as well as attempting to recruit in high schools. 'That temptation would certainly be there, and for someone who already has those skills it would be an easy transition,' he said. A fitness studio in Bolton provoked an outcry last year after introducing pole dancing lessons for children and then posting pictures of the classes on Facebook. Parents and councillors who deemed the junior sessions at JLN Pole Fitness inappropriate raised concerns over the images being published online, with one mother claiming it would encourage child grooming. But instructor Jess Leanne Norris said photographs were only put on the website with parents' consent, and that there was 'nothing inappropriate' about the pole dancing classes.","Children aged between five and 12 have already been enrolled in the 'Little Spinners' classes .

Lord Coe today attacked the British press for 'resorting to type' today, accusing them of focusing more on England's football match with Moldova then on one of the last days on the Paralympic Games. He said newspapers bumped the Paralympics off the back pages usually reserved for sport to concentrate on England's football win . Most papers carried England's 5-0 victory over Moldova to lead their sports coverage, as Roy Hodgson's men opened their World Cup Qualifying campaign with their biggest away win for nearly two decades. Priorities: Lord Coe accused the press of focusing on England's football performance, instead of the Paralympics . Seb Coe says the future of Paralympic sport rests on the press' coverage . It came on a relatively barren day for ParalympicsGB, as discus thrower Josie Pearson won Great Britain's tenth athletics gold of the Games - but the only top medal of the day. Her success came nine years after breaking her neck in a car accident, the 26-year-old setting three world records on her way to claiming the discus title. Lord Coe emphasised that without the press' involvement, the interest around the Paralympics could fade if they did not keep up reports. Asked how the profile of Paralympic sport could be maintained after the Games, Lord Coe said: 'With your (press) help. 'The future of Paralympic sport in large part lies with you, your editors and the ability of broadcasters to take this beyond the three or four weeks that we've witnessed here. 'It is a challenge for Olympic Sport, it is a challenge for Paralympic Sport.' In an apparent attack on Paralympic coverage in today's newspapers, the London 2012 chairman criticised 'the speed with which we reverted to back-page leads for England-Moldova'. He added: 'That relegation happened too quickly. We (the Paralympics Committee) could not have done more in the last seven years to move this on. 'It now sits in a large part with you guys. 'We will go on showing that Paralympic sports is an extraordinary sport. This now sits here. 'The speed with which we resorted to type last night was maybe not a great sign.'

Mickey Bushell , who won Gold in the Mens 100m - T53, came fourth in the final of the men's 200m T53 with an English record of 26.32 seconds .

"By . Gethin Chamberlain . PUBLISHED: . 16:02 EST, 8 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:41 EST, 9 September 2012 . Britain is frittering away tens of millions of pounds hiring an army of consultants to tell India how to run its own affairs. A Mail on Sunday investigation into contracts awarded to consultants has found that instead of money going directly to India’s poor and needy, much of it goes into the pockets of firms, some American, that are paid to hold meetings and produce reports. It hired a group of consultants - including one leading US university - to work on a £5 million deal to tell the Department for International Development whether it was wasting money. The UK Government insists it will continue to give the economic superpower £280 million a year until 2015 – despite India’s insistence that it does not want or need the money. The UK Government is spending millions of pounds hiring consultants across the world to tell India how to spend its money instead of giving it to those who need it most . The rapidly industrialising country, whose economy is ranked 11th in the world with a GDP of £1.85 trillion, is rich enough to run its own space programme and last month announced it would spend £52 million sending a probe to Mars next year. David Cameron has courted controversy over the UK’s vast payments to India, designed, many believe, to detoxify the Tories’ image as the ‘nasty party’. Just last month a powerful committee of peers urged the Prime Minister to abandon his policy on aid to the country, saying Ministers should ‘urgently prepare an exit strategy from Britain’s £1.1 billion aid to India’. The peers pointed out that sending millions of pounds to a country that  can afford its own space programme provided a ‘perverse incentive’ for the Indian government to shirk its own responsibility for tackling poverty. India is rich enough to afford its own space programme and is spending £52m next year sending a probe to Mars . But The Mail on Sunday has discovered that since the Government announced an overhaul of Indian aid spending in 2010 in response to criticism, it has: . The Government awarded £5million to Duke University, North Carolina, to assess how affective its aid spending has been . The Department for International Development (DfID) has a staff of 90 and uses outside contractors for much of its work. The department also outsources its recruitment to private firms in India. The practice has raised questions about what its own staff are doing. In the past year, the UK donated £292.5 million to India, with £268.4 million from DfID’s budget, despite comments from Indian finance minister Pranab Mukherjee that India did not need British aid, which he described as ‘a peanut in our total development exercises’. India's Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, right, has said India does not need British aid . Last night, Tory backbencher Philip Davies said: ‘To spend any money at all on aid to India is unjustifiable, but for the money from the aid budget to be spent on US academics and Western consultants is both beyond belief and beneath contempt. ‘Clearly, DflD have so much money they don’t know what to do with it and it’s about time George Osborne cut the budget down to a much more affordable figure where the money could be spent on alleviating real poverty.’ Chancellor George Osborne is coming under pressure to reduce the amount of money awarded to the Department for International Development (DfID) Julian Morris, vice-president of research at the Reason Foundation think-tank and author of a recent report on foreign aid for the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ‘When Britain’s national debt is growing, it is highly irresponsible to continue to fritter away our children’s future on pointless and even counterproductive foreign “aid”. ‘There is a major problem, because those consultants are powerful and vocal vested interests. ‘Some of them, as this investigation documents, even masquerade as charities and religious organisations.’ India also runs its own overseas aid programme, which is worth about £2 billion a year. Former International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell – who was replaced last week by Justine Greening – repeatedly insisted that Britain’s aid commitment to India runs until only 2015. But last April DfID awarded a £7,506,606 contract to the Asian Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex for ‘research consultancy services’ as part of a six-year programme in South Asia. Last night the DfID said: ‘The new Secretary of State for International Development is looking carefully at DfID activity in India. As we have always made clear, DfID will not be in India for ever. We are currently discussing the future of our programme with the government of India.’","UK Government awards £280m to India every year .

More than 3,200 school children received treatment for alcohol misuse last year out of which nearly 400 were under the age of 14. The shocking figures reveal that 18 local authorities in Britain cared for more than ten children aged 12 or 13 for their alcohol abuse last year. The new data comes after British teenage girls were named as the worst binge drinkers in the western world by a Government think-tank. Underage drinking: Thousands of school-aged children received treatment for alcohol misuse last year, as figures show British girls are the worst binge drinkers in the west (picture posed by models) Statistics from the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse (NTA) show that thousands of children have such major alcohol problems that they have to be enrolled into substance misuse programs. Health professionals blame poor celebrity role models and cheap alcohol for the high numbers which saw 369 under-14s in treatment and 2,836 who are aged 14 and 15. The data show that some areas are dealing with more than one school-aged child every week needing attention for their excessive drinking. Price hike: Tory MP Tracey Crouch hopes higher alcohol prices will help prevent underage drinking . Lancashire had the worst problem last year, with 173 under-16s needing to be put into alcohol misuse programmes. It is followed by East Sussex, which treated 145 children, and Nottinghamshire and Liverpool with 94 and 92 cases respectively . Tracey Crouch, Conservative MP for Chatham and Aylesford, and Vice-Chair of the Parliamentary Alcohol Misuse Group said she was saddened by the figures, which she called a worrying sign. She said: ‘There is a clear difference between experimentation by young people and the concerning situation here where children are having treatment because of their misuse. ‘At 12 I was out playing hide and seek. 'I know the world has changed in the last 25 years, but alcohol just didn’t feature in my life at that age.' She added that minimum pricing of alcohol would be one way to tackle the problem. ‘At the moment alcohol is incredibly cheap. Kids don’t have a lot of cash and so if you increase the price of alcohol it should help to price them out of drinking.’ Cheap booze: Low prices on alcohol could be a cause of underage drinking and alcohol abuse among under-16s . NTA Director of Delivery, Rosanna . O’Connor said: ‘More young people than ever are overcoming their . problems with alcohol misuse. 'Any substance misuse among young people is . cause for concern.

Hospital data shows that almost six children every day are being admitted to hospital with alcohol related illnesses and the numbers seeking treatment for their problems has increased by 12 per cent over the last eight years. A Government Alcohol Strategy was launched last year which outlined action to be taken to improve alcohol education for children and young people. The Government has also doubled the maximum fine for persistently selling alcohol to people under legal drinking age to £20,000, and made it easier to close down premises found to be persistently selling alcohol to young people.","Lancashire named worst area with 173 children in treatment in 2011 .

A child rapist was finally caught when his victim’s eagle-eyed aunt spotted him on a train nearly eight years after he attacked her niece. Kifueni Kadiabioko, 41, was recognised by the woman as he chatted to friends on a train at London’s Euston station on February 12 this year. Kadiabioko had been wanted in connection with an attack on a 12-year-old girl in Coventry in October 2004 and the aunt, who had previously met the assailant at a church group, alerted the police. Officers then arrested Kadiabioko after the train pulled into Northampton station. He was transferred to West Midlands Police station where the investigation was still live and presented with DNA evidence which had been safely stored since being recovered from the victim’s clothing. Kadiabioko then admitted raping the 12-year-old on three occasions, all after accosting her on the way home from school, and at Coventry Crown Court today he was jailed for 11 years and three months for each offence, to run concurrently. He will also remain on the Sex Offenders Register indefinitely. Kadiabioko was 33 when he . befriended the victim’s family through a church group. He abused their trust . and took advantage of the 12-year-old girl. The attack took place after he pulled his car alongside her and beckoned her into the passenger seat on October 1 2004.

'Initially he denied any sexual activity took place but forensics evidence was kept on file from the time of the offence and compared against Kadiabioko’s DNA which returned a match. 'It was a fantastic spot by the victim’s auntie. Her swift actions in notifying us meant we were able to liaise with British Transport Police and Northants Police to arrest him as the train pulled into Northampton. 'She should also be praised for her restraint in not challenging Kadiabioko and making her 999 call discretely so as not to alert him. 'This young girl was vulnerable and terrified by the actions of Kadiabioko; she showed extreme bravery in reporting it to police and remaining supportive of our investigation throughout. 'Her resilience has been admirable and this outcome could not have been achieved without that support.

China’s leader-in-waiting Xi Jinping has set off a storm of rumours after cancelling several meetings and failing to turn up at scheduled public events for over a week. A source close to the Beijing leadership now claim 59-year-old Vice President Xi is ‘unwell’ after hurting his back during his daily swim. Xi Jinping called off several meetings with visiting foreign leaders and dignitaries over the past week, including U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Prime Ministers of Singapore and Denmark. Despite the rumours of ill health the Chinese government has declined to give an official explanation to the absence of Xi, who is due to take over the presidency in March next year. The silence is in keeping with decades of official secrecy over the health of senior leaders, a tradition viewed in the West as incompatible with China's position as a progressively modern state and emerging superpower. When Xi’s absence was first notice a source claimed: ‘Xi injured his back when he went for his daily swim,’ but the source declined to give further details on the injury, including exactly when and where the incident took place. Another source, citing people close to Xi, said: ‘He's unwell, but it's not a big problem.’ On Tuesday, the foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei was asked whether Xi is in good health, but only said he had no information to give, and declined to . answer further questions on the matter. The lack of official explanation has . fuelled Internet speculation surrounding Xi's condition. Absent: Speculation about the future Chinese leader's whereabouts were rife after Xi cancelled his meeting with Hilary Clinton . China's popular Twitter-like microblogging site Sina Weibo blocked searches for Xi's name, as is common with top leaders, but users as usual found ways to skirt the restrictions, referring to Xi as 'the crown prince'. ‘What's up with the crown prince? He's vanished for the last 10 days or so and the whole world is wondering where he is,’ wrote one user. Xi had been scheduled to meet visiting Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt on Monday afternoon for a photo opportunity, but the event did not take place. However, Thorning-Schmidt said that a meeting with Xi had never been on her schedule for her visit. ‘I think there has been a slight misunderstanding,’ she told Reuters. ‘I would, of course, very much like to see him [Xi] and I think I will see him at some stage, perhaps on my next visit to China, but he was never in my programme which we released on Friday, so there shouldn't be anything new in my not seeing him.’ Prime time miss: Danish PM Helle Thoring-Schmidt and Singapore's Lee Hsien Loong were both originally scheduled to meet with Xi Jinping during their visits . The foreign ministry's website shows Xi's most recent public appearance was at a ceremony at the ruling Communist Party's Central Party School in Beijing on September 1. The rumours about Xi come at a tempestuous time for Chinese politics. The 18th Communist Party Congress, at which China's next top leaders including Xi are likely to be unveiled, is set to take place in October. Earlier this year, senior politician Bo Xilai, once seen as a candidate for the top rung of party leadership, was suspended from the Politburo and his wife convicted of murdering a British businessman. The wife, Gu Kailai, was given a suspended death sentence last month. In another scandal this month, a senior ally of President Hu Jintao was demoted after sources said the ally's son was involved in a deadly crash involving a luxury sports car. Last year, the official Xinhua news agency was forced to come out with a one-line statement in English denying former President Jiang Zemin had died, following feverish online speculation and a report from a Hong Kong television station.","Vice President have not been seen since September 1 .

Bryan Harris, 45, from Newton Abbot, Devon, claimed he had been ‘defending his dignity’ when he battered victim Paul Drury in a prolonged attack that lasted up to 15 minutes. Exeter Crown Court heard how all three had been staying in the same house when Harris awoke to find his room empty and Miss Lewis moaning. Harris told the jury: ‘She was moaning in pleasure downstairs and Paul was naked on top of her and they were having sex on the floor of the living room. ‘I said to Paul “what are you doing?” ‘I was shouting and swearing at him. He got off her and we exchanged words. I was very annoyed and hurt and being betrayed by him and Dawn. ‘He told me he loved her too and said I’d used her for money. I told him I loved the girl.’ Harris admitted fighting Mr Drury, who had Asperger's syndrome, and said: ‘I was giving him a hiding to say “keep off my missus”. I had lost all control. I did not realise how badly I had injured him.’ Harris denied using a dented frying pan to carry out the violent attack on 32-year-old Mr Drury before he also left lover Dawn Lewis with serious facial wounds. Miss Lewis, 46, said Harris has a strong sex drive but had not had sex with her for more than a month after she had had surgery. She told the jury at Exeter Crown Court that Harris - whom she had only been seeing for a few months - ‘seemed to want it every day’. Hours before the murder Harris had pestered her for sex but she refused despite his repeated attempts. Exeter Crown Court heard how Mr Drury had been a guest at the home Miss Lewis shared with Harris when Harris awoke to find their room empty and Miss Lewis moaning downstairs . She told the jury she cannot recall how she got her injuries and was confused as to whether she had had sex with Harris on that November night. In police interviews Harris insisted that two men and two women had burst into the house in and launched the attack which he single handedly repelled. But he later admitted that he was responsible for the assaults on his friend and his lover. Miss Lewis, who had taken a sleeping tablet, told the court that she could not recall having sex with Mr Drury.

Stevie Jones, 17, Kieron Chapman, 16 and Michael Cuttle, 16, were lucky to escape after the gold-coloured hatchback ploughed into the home in Blaenymaes, South Wales. About 150 people came to the house to see the aftermath of the crash, which happened on Sunday evening. Crash: Three teenagers were lucky to escape after this gold-coloured hatchback ploughed into the house in Blaenymaes, South Wales . Diane Edwards, 57, who lives in the house with Keiron, her grandson, was visibly shaken by the incident. She was out visiting her son at the time of the crash, but travelled home immediately after her daughter phoned to tell her what had happened. Ms Edwards, who has lived in the property for 35 years, said: 'Every Sunday I go up to my son’s for dinner. My daughter phoned me and said there was either a car in the garden or in the house. 'We both came straight home. It is lucky it didn’t go in far.' Firefighters, ambulance crews and police attended the scene shortly after 8.20pm. A spokeswoman for South Wales Police confirmed two men from Swansea had been arrested in connection with the incident. A 22-year-old was arrested on suspicion of driving with excess alcohol, and a 24-year-old was arrested on suspicion of failing to stop and report a collision. Penderry councillor Terry Hennegan lives close to where the incident happened and said it was the first incident of its kind in four or five years. It is not known if speed was a factor in the collision, but he said cars being driven too fast had been a problem in the past. Mr Hennegan said: 'There was a time when there was a lot of it going on up here, but police and the community came together and that was stamped out. 'It is sad that something like this has happened, but it is an isolated incident.' Mr Hennegan said he knew the family who lived in the house and praised them for their work in the community.

Seasonal flow patterns seen by spacecraft orbiting Mars could have been caused by salty water, new research suggests. Dark, finger-like features appear and extend down some Martian slopes during late spring through summer, fade in winter, and return during the next spring. Now two U.S.-based researchers have explained how the intriguing dark streaks could have been caused by the melting and subsequent evaporation of frozen salty water. Flow patterns: Dark, finger-like features appear and extend down some Martian slopes during late spring through summer, fade in winter, and return during the next spring . The lines, first spotted last year by Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, lengthen and darken on rocky equator-facing slopes from late spring to early autumn. Research published at the time said that these seasonal changes suggested that a volatile substance was involved, but the environment is too warm for carbon dioxide frost and too cold for pure water. Some kind of brine was suggested as fitting the bill, but until now there had been no theories as to what that could consist of. 'We had to find a salt-water mixture that would come and go,' said Vincent Chevrier, a research assistant professor in the Arkansas Center for Space and Planetary Sciences, and lead author of the new study. Professor Chevrier and co-author . Edgard Rivera-Valentin, now at Brown University, investigated forms of . salt known to form on Mars to work out how they could affect the melting . and evaporation points of ice and water. This animation shows how the streaks appear, extend, then disappear with the passage of Martian seasons . The director of Nasa's Mars exploration programme says he hopes that one day the rover Curiosity might be brought back to Earth by astronauts. Doug McCuistion said it was his personal hope that humans would visit the Red Planet in the 2030s or 2040s. He said he could imagine astronauts walking up to Curiosity. Mr McCuistion said the roving laboratory's mission was scheduled to last two years, but it could have enough power for 20 years. The Nasa chief set out his vision during a satellite link up with Glenelg in the Scottish Highlands at the weekend. The community of about 280 people has twinned itself with a site on Mars that Nasa has labelled Glenelg - 35 million miles away. Mr McCuistion said: 'It is my hope that humans will be sent to Mars in the 2030s, or 2040s, and they will be able to walk up to Curiosity and bring it back, as I am sure there is a museum out there that would love to have it.' Basing their model on soils up to 20cm deep, because beyond that depth the seasonal temperatures would not affect the freezing and melting aspects of the salt-water mixtures, they found calcium chloride fits the bill. 'In one day we could form enough liquid to create these flow features on the surface,' Professor Chevrier said. The model also explained why the flow features disappeared by incorporating evaporation into the model. 'The easier it becomes to melt, the easier it becomes to evaporate,' the professor said. At low concentrations of brine, 'as soon as it melts, it evaporates and disappears.' The researchers showed that they could melt enough calcium chloride brine so that it would not completely evaporate, thus creating conditions that might explain the flow features. Their model fits with the seasonal change in flow observations, with the flows occurring on equator facing slopes and with seasonal changes. Also, high surface evaporation rates as demonstrated in their model explain why, if there is water, it would disappear relatively quickly and why imaging spectrometry on Mars has not identified water signatures. Mars is now a frozen desert, but geological studies of rocks by previous missions to the surface have suggested the planet used to be warmer and wetter. Finding water is a first step toward learning whether the environment could support microbes. Scientists generally agree that besides water and an energy source such as the sun, organic carbon is a necessary prerequisite for life.","Flow patterns appear down slopes during late spring then fade in winter .

Battling for life: Little Will Riggans, pictured, survived when his mother was killed in a car crash last week but his chances are grim . A newly married North Carolina man whose pregnant wife was killed in a devastating car crash has held his baby boy for the first time as doctors warn the infant's chance of survival is grim. Megan Riggans, 22, was thrown through the windshield of the couple's SUV on September 2 as her husband Brian 'Casey' Riggans rushed her to hospital to give birth to their little boy. Megan wasn't wearing a seat-belt, because she was having contractions during her labour, when the vehicle ran 20 feet off the road and slammed into a tree. She was pronounced dead at Almance Regional Medical Center but doctors managed to save the couple's child, Will, who they delivered by C-section. The baby, however, suffered serious head trauma in the collision and has been on life support since the crash. Megan's uncle, Randy Lewis, spoke out about the family's devastation and explained that the little boy he calls the 'miracle kid' was losing his battle for life. 'The doctors said that with the extent of his injuries, it is uncertain if he can survive,' Lewis said, according to the Burlington Times News. 'During the accident, he was oxygen deprived and received blunt force trauma to his little head.' Lewis added that it took doctors nine minutes to get Will's heart started - during which time his oxygen supply was cut off - and he doesn't have much brain activity. 'His father and the doctors are reviewing his condition and some hard decisions are still ahead,' he said. Newlyweds: The Riggans got married this past April and were expecting the arrival of their first child on September 27 . Tragic couple: Megan Riggans, right, and her husband, left, were involved in a car wreck Sunday night that cost the young wife and expecting mother her life . Lewis said the family was keeping . constant vigil at the hospital, adding that the uncertainty of Will’s . condition was difficult on everyone. 'If he stays here, we get him,' Lewis said. 'If he can’t stay here, his mama and great-granddaddy get him.' Casey Riggans, 22, suffered a broken skull . and fractured jaw in the crash, and was able to hold his little boy for . the first time on Sunday after he was moved out of the intensive care . unit at UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill. Last Thursday, Casey had surgery, which wired his jaw shut. 'The operation was a success, however, he has a long road to a full recovery,' Lewis said. Emotional, he said the first thing Casey said to him when he regained consciousness and was told the heart-breaking news was 'sorry'. 'I couldn’t quite understand why that was in his mind,' said Lewis, a dairy farmer who was like a second father to Megan. Devastating crash: The newlywed's car, pictured, slid off the road on their way to the hospital to deliver little Will . Crash site: The Riggans were driving to a hospital on Greensboro-Chapel Hill Road in rural Alamance County when their car hydroplaned and slammed into a tree . 'This . is a terrible thing that happened. I’m not mad at anybody. I don’t . blame anybody. ...I just hate that it had to happen to her.' In . a press conference, Lewis described how the couple, . who were married only a few months ago, had spent the day with family . before the fated trip to the hospital. Both Casey and Megan's extended families arrived at the hospital before they did. No one knew they'd been in a crash until later. According to Megan’s Facebook page, the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University graduate was expected to give birth on September 27, which means that Riggans was nearly four weeks away from her due date at the time of the crash. Authorities said that the Riggans visited the UNC Chapel Hill Hospital the day before the crash, when the 22-year-old started having contractions, but she was sent home. The accident took place just before 10pm on Greensboro-Chapel Hill Road, a rural area in southern Alamance County. A severe thunderstorm had dumped heavy rains on the highway, causing minor flooding and limiting visibility.","Baby Will Riggans delivered by C-section after mother, Megan, killed in car crash on way to hospital to give birth .

Deceptive: Former Scotland Yard detective Ryan Coleman-Farrow failed to properly investigate 13 sex crimes . Eleven suspected sex attackers may never be brought to justice because a detective failed to investigate crimes properly. Ryan Coleman-Farrow, 30, lied to rape victims that their cases had been dropped, avoided interviewing key witnesses, failed to get CCTV footage of attacks and did not send exhibits for forensic analysis. The former Metropolitan Police officer bungled 13 cases in total, and yesterday pleaded guilty in court to 13 counts of misconduct in a public office. The offences were carried out between January 2007 and September 2010, while Coleman-Farrow worked as a detective constable on Scotland Yard's Sapphire unit, which deals with investigations into rape and sexual assault. He was sacked last year after an internal investigation. Southwark Crown Court heard that Coleman-Farrow's misconduct related to 10 rape cases and three sexual assault inquiries. Prosecutor Mark Heywood QC said that in 'almost all' of the 13 cases involved, no proceedings had resulted. The investigations included 12 complainants and 11 suspects, he said. Coleman-Farrow, from St Leonards-on-Sea, Hastings, East Sussex, was taken to court after an inquiry by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). The investigation followed complaints by a sex worker called Jaime Perlman, who claimed she was being stalked by a client in 2009 and was unhappy with the way Coleman-Farrow had handled the harassment allegations. Miss Perlman later took her own life in an apparent suicide pact with another sex worker Riley Lison-Taylor, and no findings were made against Coleman-Farrow in relation to that case. But the IPCC probe uncovered the officer's misconduct in other investigations. IPCC deputy chairman Deborah Glass said: 'Ryan Coleman-Farrow was entrusted to investigate serious sexual offences and support some of the most vulnerable people in the criminal justice system. 'He let them down by his calculated abuse of their trust. His actions are beyond belief. 'After Mr Coleman-Farrow's initial criminal interview with the IPCC in November 2010, we submitted a file to the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) to allow them to fast-track the misconduct process, and the MPS dismissed him in April 2011 while our investigation continued.' Shame: Coleman-Farrow, who pleaded guilty to 13 counts of misconduct in a public office, walked with his head bowed outside court . She said that the force had reviewed all cases where Coleman-Farrow was in charge and that he was 'a rogue officer who set out to deceive'. Ms Glass continued: 'The MPS have told us they reviewed all cases where Mr Coleman-Farrow was officer in charge and I understand that where cases required further or re-investigation this has been done. 'Our investigation did not reveal systemic or serious supervisory failings. While we may never fully understand the motivation for his actions, Mr Coleman-Farrow appears to have been a rogue officer who set out to deceive. 'While dealing with rogue individuals must always be a concern in any system, supervisory systems will not necessarily pick up on an officer who has concocted evidence to cover their tracks. 'In pleading guilty, Ryan Coleman-Farrow has at least spared some of his victims the burden of reliving their experiences, in court, of how their cases were, or were not investigated.' The IPCC said that Coleman-Farrow had made false or misleading crime report entries 32 times, falsified a witness statement and twice claimed he had interviewed a rape suspect without actually doing so. He also faked suspect accounts on three occasions, falsely claimed to have taken witness statements 15 times and said he had submitted files to the CPS without having done so seven times. The Metropolitan Police said that after reviewing the 13 cases, 'no additional evidential or judicial opportunities were identified'. Commander Peter Spindler said: 'We expect the highest standard of conduct from our officers, particularly within the Sapphire Command with its clear focus on victim care. 'This individual clearly fell well below those standards and it is therefore only right that he take full responsibility for his failings. 'His dismissal and subsequent criminal conviction sends a clear message to both the public and colleagues that neither the police service nor the courts will tolerate such serious professional failings.' Judge Alistair McCreath granted Coleman-Farrow bail. The former officer is due to be sentenced next month.

Vladimir Putin has admitted that some of his media adventures with wildlife were carefully staged, but said they were worthwhile because they drew attention to conservation projects. The Russian president's appearances with everything from tigers to whales have been a staple of Russian state TV for years, cementing his image as a man of action. They have drawn mockery from critics, however, who have likened them to Soviet-style propaganda. Carefully staged: Vladimir Putin has often by portrayed by the media as a rugged outdoorsman, but for the first time has admitted that the various stunts he takes part in are carefully stage-managed . His latest adventure: Russian President Vladimir Putin . flies in a motorised glider to lead lost young Siberian cranes onto their . correct migration path . Putin's spokesman has previously revealed that at least one of the stunts was a set-up, but Mr Putin has appeared to play along, allowing state media to present them as they seem rather than how they really are. But in a meeting with a Kremlin critic after his latest stunt - taking to the skies in a light aircraft with a group of cranes last week - Mr Putin admitted he had often taken part in media exercises which were carefully stage-managed. Sometimes, he said, the stunts had been over the top. 'Of course, there are excesses. And I am enraged about it,' he told Masha Gessen, a journalist and staunch Putin critic. She had been invited for a meeting in the Kremlin after she was sacked from her job editing a travel magazine for refusing to send reporters to cover the crane flight. She wrote an account of her meeting with the president in Bolshoi Gorod magazine. Watch the birdie: Putin keeps a careful eye on one of the cranes while waiting in a motorized hang-glider. Ms Gessen lost her job as editor of a travel magazine because she refused to send reporters to cover the stunt . Opposition: President Putin insisted the value . of the stunts was to draw awareness to wildlife conservation, in an . interview the with journalist Masha Gessen, a Putin critic who lost her . job because of her political stance . 'But I thought up these tigers myself. Twenty other countries where tigers live, also started taking care of them,' she quoted him as saying, referring to an incident four years ago when he was shown shooting a tiger with a tranquiliser gun in order to track it for a conservation project. Critics later suggested the tiger had been driven in from a zoo for Mr Putin to shoot for the TV cameras. 'The leopards were also my idea,' Mr Putin was quoted as saying. 'Yes, I know, they were caught before but the most important thing is to draw public attention to the problem.' He was apparently referring to an episode in 2011 when he was shown tagging and releasing a rare and injured snow leopard. Critics again said it had been brought in specially. 'Everything I do in this area (wildlife conservation) should have nothing to do with politics. But for a man in my position it is very difficult,' Mr Putin said.

Rugged outdoorsman: Left, Mr Putin attends a . meeting of motor bikers at their camp at Gasfort Lake near Sevastopol in . Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula. Right, he fishes in the Yenisei River in .

'Why did I dive? Not to show my gills off but to make sure people learn history. Of course it was a set up,' the journalist quoted Mr Putin as saying. The Russian president's spokesman has previously revealed the Black Sea find was staged, admitting it was 'obvious' the jugs had been found earlier by archaeologists and left their for Mr Putin to find.

Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, where Mr Putin is spending a few days this week, that Ms Gessen had provided 'a correct account of the meeting except for some insignificant details.' Mr Putin's summons to Ms Gessen appeared to be an attempt to mediate in her dispute with her former employer. She said that Mr Putin, flanked by the magazine's owner, asked her whether she really wanted to have her job back or whether she was comfortable with the role of 'a persecuted journalist'. Ms Gessen wrote that she had refused to accept Mr Putin's offer to take her old job back, saying she did not want to work in a magazine where an editor-in-chief is appointed by Mr Putin. However, Mr Peskov said that Ms Gessen had initially agreed to take her old job back only to change her mind the following day.",Russian president gives Kremlin interview to opposition journalist who lost her job because she refused to cover his latest stunt .

A long-simmering volcano exploded with a series of powerful eruptions in Guatemala yesterday, prompting evacuation orders for thousands of families. Thick clouds of ash nearly two miles high spewed from the Volcan del Fuego, six miles south-west of the colonial city of Antigua, as rivers of searing-hot lava flowed down its flanks. Guatemala's head of emergency evacuations Sergio Cabanas said 33,000 people were ordered to leave some 17 villages around the volcano. Hot: Rivers of lava flows from the Volcan de Fuego, as seen from the town of Palin late last night . Explosive: The eruption looks even more dramatic at night as the volcano spews fire and lava . The ash was blowing south-south-east . and authorities said the tourist centre of the country was not currently . in danger, although they expected the eruption to last for at least 12 . more hours. Hundreds of . cars, trucks and buses, blanketed with charcoal grey cash packed with . fearful residents, sped away from the volcano along a two-lane paved . highway toward Guatemala City.

The elderly, women and . children filled old school buses and ambulances carrying them from the . area. Non-stop: The lava spills out of the volcano and trickles down its side as the eruptions continued throughout Thursday night . Authorities set up a . shelter at an elementary school in Santa Lucia, the town closest to the . volcano, and by last night people had started trickling in. Most were women and children carrying blankets and going into bare classrooms. Miriam Carumaco, 28, arrived to the shelter along with 16 members of her family. 'We . heard loud thunder and then it got dark and ash began falling,' she . said. 'It sounded like a pressure cooker that wouldn't stop.' Ms . Carumaco said parents sent their children to school despite the . darkening skies, but that classes were later cancelled and teachers . walked them home.

Fuego six miles south-west of the colonial city of Antigua, Guatemala, . after it began erupting yesterday, prompting the evacuation of thousands of families . 'A . paroxysm of an eruption is taking place, a great volcanic eruption, . with strong explosions and columns of ash,' said Gustavo Chicna, a . volcanologist with the National Institute of Seismology, Vulcanology, . Meteorology and Hydrology. He said cinders spewing from the volcano were settling a half-inch thick in some places. Extremely hot gases were also rolling . down the sides of the volcano, which was almost entirely wreathed in ash . and smoke, he added. The emergency agency warned flights through the . area could be affected.

Evacuation: A boy and a woman watch plumes of smoke and volcanic ash rise from the Volcan de Fuego, as seen from Palin, south of Guatemala City . He said ash was landing as far as 50 miles south of the volcano. By yesterday evening, the ash plume . had decreased to a little more than a mile high, partly due to rain, . which diminished the potential risk to aviation, said Jorge Giron, a . government volcanologist. He . said ash continued to fall heavily, however, and advised residents near . the volcano but outside of evacuation zones to clean water systems . before using them, and to not leave their homes because of the risk.

The anti-ageing drink is the best-seller on the Boots website after it became the first in the UK to stock it . It is said to banish wrinkles, has a string of celebrities singing its praises and is available on the high street. So it is perhaps unsurprising that a collagen drink introduced at Boots last month is already proving to be something of a beauty hit. The supplement has become the biggest-selling product on the Boots website after the chain became the first in the UK to stock it. Experts, however, have said it ‘offers no advantage’ over a normal diet. The anti-ageing drink, called Pure Gold Collagen, comes in 50ml bottles containing a daily dose of collagen – a protein that gives skin strength and elasticity – along with acids designed to promote the protein’s production. As it gets older, the body’s reserves of collagen deplete, causing skin to lose firmness and develop wrinkles. A Boots spokesman yesterday said that the drink was up to 50 times more effective than collagen creams and pills at replacing the skin’s protein stores. He said: ‘It not only replaces collagen but gets straight into the blood stream so the effects can last up to two months if you stop using it.’ In clinical trials of 1,500 women aged 35 to 55 who drank it daily, two-thirds reported an ‘up to 30 per cent reduction’ in lines and wrinkles. A number of celebrities also praised the drink, which costs £35.99 for a ten-day supply. Anthea Turner, 52, said it was ‘one of the most effective skincare products’ she had tried. The former GMTV presenter  said: ‘I’m . always a little sceptical of things like this but people have been . saying “you look well” and to be honest I do.’ Celebrities backing: Former GMTV presenter Anthea Turner said the supplement was 'effective' Presenter Carol Smillie, 50, added that, after taking the drink for a few weeks, ‘my skin looks and feels more youthful, radiant and hydrated’. But some experts said the supplement was unlikely to be effective. Cosmetic dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting said: ‘A collagen drink offers no advantage that I’m aware of over normal dietary protein. ‘Replenishing collagen stores is a complex and finely tuned biological process. You can’t cheat by importing these molecules “whole” from the diet.’ Consultant dermatologist Dr Nick Lowe added that the drinks were ‘interesting’, but said: ‘More research is needed before we can be sure if they result in facial rejuvenation.’","The anti-ageing drink called Pure Gold Collagen is said to banish wrinkles .

"By . Angela Levin . PUBLISHED: . 21:13 EST, 15 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:15 EST, 2 October 2012 . Sorrow: Author Michael Morpurgo, pictured with his wife Claire, has revealed his sons don't talk to him . In the books of award-winning Michael Morpurgo, reconciliation is a recurring theme. The author of the worldwide bestseller War Horse, he has woven emotive tales of tearful reunions into several of his most successful novels. So it is perhaps poignant that he is estranged from his own two grown-up sons, a fact revealed in a recent biography of his chequered life by Maggie Fergusson. Morpurgo is deeply troubled by the family fallout but now, for the first time, it can be revealed how his alienation from his sons Sebastian, 49, and Horatio, 46, is a tragic reflection of his own troubled youthful relationship with his stepfather Jack Morpurgo. He also admits to subsequently having . an aching desire to know his real father, actor Anthony van Bridge, . about whom his mother never spoke. Morpurgo, . 68,  who married young after falling in love when just 19, says he . spent too little time with his sons and that perhaps, like his own . stepfather, he could be difficult to live with. ‘It is a difficulty but . we all have our own sadness and I long for reconciliation,’ he says . wistfully. ‘It is to do with my own shortcomings as a parent and it is a . constant theme in my books. I believe in concord rather than fight. Most fights are a waste of energy and anger is very bad for us.’ Sebastian, an English teacher  who lives in Zagreb, Croatia, and Horatio, a writer who lives in Dorset, have never explained the rift with their father. And Morpurgo, too, remains silent on the subject. Previously, he has only confessed that his remorse over the ongoing deadlock between them ‘lasts longer than any kind of pleasure that comes from success’. ‘I was too young to deal with it all. I don’t think I had really grown out of being a child myself,’ he told his biographer. Today, he adds: ‘Now I have grown older, more mature and can relax into who I am, so although I am not that much wiser I am a better grandfather than I was a father.’ Heartbreaking story: Morpurgo's tale seems all the more sad after the joy he brought to children and adults with his popular book and film War Horse . There have been some clues about the reasons for the rift. The author also has an adopted daughter, Rosalind, who did contribute to the biography. Recently, she has suggested that her brothers’ schooling could have been a factor. When Morpurgo was a teacher he became so disenchanted with private schools that he vowed never to work in one again. Yet despite this, he sent his sons to a private boarding school. ‘Being sent away to school did  put a distance between us and our parents,’ Rosalind has said. It has also been suggested that Morpurgo’s insistence on helping other children may have had a detrimental influence on his relationship with his sons. The biography describes the early years of the children’s charity he set up, Farms For City Children, and how it took up much of his time. Indeed, in the book, Morpurgo admits as much, saying that time ‘hitherto lavished on our own  children’ was now spent on ‘hordes of total strangers’. Morpurgo and his own stepfather were never close. ‘My stepfather was a demanding and domineering man. The author was estranged from his own father Anthony van Bridge, pictured, but they were reconciled in later life . ‘My father had wanted my older brother Pieter and me to keep his name but my stepfather insisted we all have the same name. ‘Although we were one family we were not one big happy family and I felt, as adopted children often do, that I didn’t belong. I knew better than to mention my father and he never contacted us.’ The young Michael was just two years old when his natural father Tony van Bridge returned from the Second World War to discover his wife Kippe had fallen in love with soldier-turned-publisher Jack Morpurgo, and wanted to marry him. Van Bridge bowed out and the next time Morpurgo saw his father, astonishingly, was on television. ‘It was Christmas Eve 1961 and I was watching a television adaptation of Dickens’ Great Expectations with Kippe. ‘Young Pip was making his way through the graveyard at dusk, when up from behind a gravestone reared the terrifying figure of Magwitch, the escaped convict, his face hideous and eyes glaring. ‘Kippe, sitting beside me, let out a cry, “Oh my God. That’s Tony. That’s your father.’’ It was the first time his name had been  spoken in public. I had no idea until then what he looked like.’ He eventually met him a few years after seeing him on the small screen. ‘My mother and stepfather insisted I call them by their first names, which was trendy in the Sixties, so it was lovely to find someone I could call Dad. ‘I was more at ease with him than my stepfather and we really loved each other. It was equally wonderful to discover things about each other. Dad, who had married again and had two more children, was such a sympathetic person and so interested in my life. He came over a couple of times a year to see me and the grandchildren and often stayed with us for the weekend. ‘Sadly, he died eight years ago, aged 87. He was the last of my parents to die and when it happened I thought, “I am now an orphan.’’ I have felt more vulnerable and aware of my mortality ever since.’ Morpurgo's masterpiece, War Horse, has become a wildly popular film and play enjoyed across the world. Pictured, the Lincoln Center Theater in New York . But while Morpurgo is, it seems, estranged from his sons,  who refused to co-operate with the recent biography, he is a  doting grandfather. He has seven grandchildren, aged from seven to 25. ‘You see some grandchildren frequently, some less frequently,’ he confides. ‘Because you don’t see them every day it is not so intense as it is with your own children and that makes the times you have with them special.’ ‘Yes,’ he then adds tellingly, ‘I think not being there all the time is the key. But it is happily intense when they are. I used to read a lot to them when they were younger.’ Rejection has been another recurring theme in Morpurgo’s life. When he was dating his wife Clare, her millionaire father, the late Sir Allen Lane, founder of Penguin, considered him an unworthy suitor. Fortunately, the Morpurgos’ marriage has been exceedingly happy and is, he believes, the rock upon which his successful career has been built. They met while both on holiday in Corfu when he was 19 and she a year older. She became pregnant soon afterwards and Sir Allen insisted Morpurgo do the decent thing. ‘It was a shotgun wedding in a register office with just both sets of parents there,’ he recalls. ‘He thought I was a gold digger and she could do much better, which is completely understandable. Fortunately before he  died of cancer in 1970, I visited him in hospital and he made it clear, although not in so many words, that he was now OK about our marriage.’","Writer was also estranged from his father, but they later reconciled .

Every driver in Australia knows it is an offence to use a mobile phone while travelling along the highway. So at first it might be wondered why Ross Gundry is upset about being pulled over by a traffic cop while he was on the phone. But the reason for his frown when the police officer told him he was being booked was perhaps understandable – because Mr Gundry was sitting on a cart being pulled along by his Clydesdale horse Toffee at the time. Buggy bother: Mr Gundry was talking on his mobile phone whilst steering a carriage drawn by his horse Toffee (picture unrelated) He was flabbergasted when he was issued with an on-the-spot fine for $250 (£163) for using his phone while in charge of a vehicle. Mr Gundry, who runs Swan Valley Wagon Trails in Perth, Western Australia, told the Hills Gazette Community Newspaper, that he had been travelling all around Perth in the wagon trail business for years and he’d always used his mobile phone while on the road. ‘I thought that a horse-drawn vehicle was OK,’ he said. In fact it was – under an old law. Section 265 of the Road Traffic Code relating to use of mobile phones was changed in March 2011 from ‘using a mobile phone while driving a motor vehicle’ to ‘using a mobile phone while driving a vehicle'. Nicked: Mr Gundry was fined by police on a highway near the city of Perth, Australia . ‘I was only travelling at 2kph’ he said, when nine-year-old Toffee pulling his cart along. He and Toffee had been travelling along the same route for the past four years and he suggested the horse could ‘probably do it on her own.’ Mr Gundry, 56, said he reluctantly accepted the ticket but he is now seeking legal advice on whether he should contest his booking. ‘The law is the law and if I don’t know the law, that’s bad luck. However, there has to be some common sense.’ A ‘reasonable man’ he said, would have pulled him over and issued a verbal warning. ‘There’s no such thing as community policing any more,’ he told the newspaper. ‘It’s pure revenue raising, that’s all this is,’ he said. ‘The least the policeman could have done is warn me the law had changed.’ He added: ‘If police want to be respected they should respect the public and use common sense, too.’","Ross Gundry was on the phone on a highway in Perth, Australia .

The bombshell secret videos of Mitt Romney at a Florida fundraiser in May miss out 'one to two minutes' of the Republican nominee's remarks, the magazine that released the footage has admitted. It may never be known what was said in the gap between the two parts of the 49-minute video. The missing section is shortly after Romney's now infamous comment that 'there are 47 percent who are with him [President Obama], who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims.' The first tape ends: 'We do all these polls - I find it amazing. We poll all these people to see where you stand in the polls but 45 percent of the people vote for the Republicans and 48 or 49...' Mystery minutes: The embarrassing secret videos of Mitt Romney at a Florida fundraiser in May may be short 'one to two minutes' of the Republican's full remarks . In the second, it picks up with Romney talking about a completely different subject: '...about twice as much as China, not 10 times as much like is reported. And we have responsibility for the whole world, they’re only focused on one little area of the world, the South China Sea...' Mother Jones billed the 49 minutes as 'raw and uncut' and 'full.' David Corn, the Mother Jones reporter who broke the story, told Politico that the video was published as he received it from his unidentified source. 'When we put up the full video, the source said - and I have no reason not to believe him - that the device that was being used inadvertently shut down or timed-out,' he told Politico. 'As soon as he knew that, he turned . the camera back on and, at most, one to two minutes were missed. The . video came to me as two separate files, and that is how we posted it on . the website.' It is not . known who passed the video to Mother Jones, though it has been widely . speculated that a member of the waiting staff, rather than a donor who . paid $50,000 to listen to Romney, is the culprit. Leaked: Mother Jones, a liberal news magazine, says it obtained the footage from an anonymous person who attended the fundraiser . Bona fide: The Romney campaign did not dispute the authenticity of the video . The taping of the event may have been illegal. Florida law requires that anyone taping conversations has to get the permission of everyone involved - something that clearly did not happen in this case. But no 'victim' has complained in this . instance and even if one did it might be ruled that Romney had no . 'reasonable expectation of privacy' in this case because his remarks . were to 100 people and the fundraiser was therefore essentially a public . event. One of the great . mysteries of the Watergate scandal was the missing 18.5 minutes of a . potentially incriminating Oval Office tape of President Richard Nixon . that had been subpoenaed by prosecutors. Grandsons: Romney jokes around with his grandchildren, from left to right: Owen, 5; Wyatt, 7; Nash, 3; and Sawyer, 1, aboard his campaign charter jet in Salt Lake City, Utah . Tender moments: Romney was pictured on Tuesday in candid shots with his grandson Nash, 3, as Gracie, 9, and Sawyer, 1, visit him on his campaign charter plane in Salt Lake City . Rose Mary Wood, Nixon's secretary, said she might have erased several minutes by accidentally pressing record but many suspected damaging material was deliberately wiped. It also emerged from the 'full' tape that Romney had spoken of an event similar to the Iranian hostage crisis that helped end Jimmy Carter's presidency in 1980 could be an 'opportunity' for him. The Republican presidential candidate . said that if he were a confronted with a hostage situation before . the presidential election, he would 'take advantage' of it. He was responding to a question about . the Iran crisis, which is credited with defeating Jimmy Carter in 1980 . and ushering in Ronald Reagan. Romney family values: The Republican candidate plays with grandson five-year-old Owen, right, and nine-year-old granddaughter Gracie (in chair), two of the five children of his son Josh and wife Jen . Proud grandpa: Romney watches as one-year-old Sawyer runs past on his campaign charter plane in Salt Lake City, Utah . He said: 'One of the things that’s frustrating to me: in a typical day like this, when I do three or four events like this, the number of foreign policy questions I get is between zero and one. 'And the American people are not concentrated at all on China, on Russia, Iran, Iraq, and this President’s failure to put in place a status of forces agreement allowing ten to twenty thousand troops to stay in Iraq- unthinkable! 'And yet, in that election, in the . Jimmy Carter election, the fact that we had hostages in Iran, I mean, . that was all we talked about. And we had the two helicopters crash in . the desert, I mean, that was the focus, and so him solving that made all . the difference in the world. 'I’m . afraid today that if you simply got Iran to agree to stand down on . nuclear weapons, they'd go, ""Now hold on. It’s really a -"" I mean, if . something of that nature presents itself I will work to find a way to . take advantage of the opportunity.' Gracious host: Hedge fund manager Marc Leder threw the $50,000-a-plate fundraiser where the Mother Jones video was recorded . The videos have exposed Romney for making more gaffes after the full transcript of his controversial speech was made public. Romney - who is worth $250million - jokes he is 'as poor as a church mouse' and blasts late night chat show host David Letterman, who on Tuesday interviewed President Obama. In clumsy anti-immigration comments, he also says: 'If you have no skill or experience... you're welcome to cross the border and stay here for the rest of your life.' As Romney tries to move past the headlines about the secretly taped video, his campaign is framing the 48 days until the election as a choice between 'two visions for America.' In an attempt to turn the tables on . Obama, whose super PAC allies have already released ads featuring the . Florida fundraiser, the Romney campaign is highlighting a 1998 audio . tape of Obama, then an Illinois state senator, talking about being in . favour of redistributing wealth. Friends in high places: President Obama chats up Beyonce and Jay-Z at the $105,000 New York City champagne fundraiser the couple threw for him on Tuesday night . Explaining himself: Romney appeared on Fox New Channel on Tuesday to talk about the Mother Jones video . Matt Rhoades, Romney's campaign manager, argued in a memo  that the differences between  Obama and Romney have become sharper. 'Mitt Romney's vision for America is an opportunity society, where free people and free enterprise thrive and success is admired and emulated, not attacked,' he wrote. In the audio tape, Obama asks: 'How do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution? Because I actually believe in redistribution, at least at a certain level, to make sure that everybody's got a shot.' Rhoades argued in the memo: 'Mitt Romney has a different idea. He knows that we need to foster growth and create wealth, not redistribute wealth, if our economy is to grow the way it has in the past.'

But when grieving daughter Anne Usher, 60, turned up to a cemetery in Glossop, Derbyshire to bury her mother Barbara Jones, 82, she found her grave had not even been dug yet. She has now won an apology from council officials after a string of graveyard bungles turned her mother’s funeral into a 'plot from a Carry On film.' Grieving: Anne Usher (pictured holding photos of her mother Barbara and father Don) has won an apology from council officials after a string of graveyard bungles at Glossop cemetery in Derbyshire turned her mother's funeral into a ''plot from a Carry On film'' Blunders: Mrs Usher (pictured at her mother Barbara Jones' grave, left) was left waiting for two and a half hours while workmen dug the grave. When the family returned to the cemetery (pictured, right) the new grave was found to be too small for Mrs Jones' coffin . Close: Mrs Usher (right, pictured here with her mother Barbara last year) was left devastated by the council's blunders . The funeral cortege agreed to wait at Mrs Jones’s home for two and half hours whilst gravediggers were hurriedly called to the scene but when they returned for the cemetery, they found the grave was too small for her coffin to fit in . Relatives burst into tears whilst other mourners squirmed in embarrassment as the coffin clattered against the edge of the grave before sticking out at an angle. When Mrs Usher complained about the funeral it emerged cemetery workers had wrongly dug another grave by mistake in preparation for the service. Officials at High Peak Council today apologised for the blunders and agreed to pay the £2,800 costs of the funeral. But Mrs Usher, of Glossop, Derbyshire, said her mother would have been 'disgusted' by what happened. 'You put your trust in those who are sorting out the funeral and do not expect this,' she said. 'All I wanted [was] a farewell fitting for a lady who was so well known and respected in the area. But this wasn’t the dignified end we had expected. 'In a sad kind of way the funeral reminded me of a Carry On film - but with no laughs at the end.' Widow Mrs Jones who died in June from liver cancer had run a newsagents in Glossop with her late husband Don for 55 years until she retired in 2008. Errors: Bungling workers dug up the grave of Mrs Usher's father Don (pictured here with Mrs Usher in 2007) by mistake thinking her mother Barbara would be buried with him . Respect: Mrs Usher lays flowers at her father's grave. She said that all she had wanted was a fitting send off for her mother Barbara Jones, who was well-respected in the local community . The funeral was planned by her family for June 25 at a church in the town attended by 40 mourners before the cortege moved onto the cemetery. Mrs Usher, a carer added: 'My mother didn’t request anything for her own funeral - all she wanted was to be buried with her mum and brother. 'I thought that it would be nice for the cortege to go past the business as it was her life and she was very well known and respected. 'It was a lovely service but when we drove into the cemetery I had a funny feeling something wasn’t right as there was nobody there and there were no workmen about. 'The funeral director said to me ‘just hang on and I’ll go and find out what’s happening’ and I knew that something was wrong. 'The funeral director then said ‘I’m sorry I don’t know how to tell you this but they have not dug the grave. 'I think everyone could tell that there was something wrong by my face I was just in shock and I was frozen. I could not comprehend what they were telling me.' Mrs Usher said her family were then told to go back to her mother's home where they waited for two and a half hours while the diggers prepared the grave. Mrs Jone's body was taken back to the undertakers. 'It’s not nice to think that she was going back and forth,' said Mrs Usher. 'It wasn’t in the least bit dignified and me, my family and friends were all very upset when we got back to my mum’s house. 'The mood was very sombre and everyone was talking about what had just happened, it was heart-breaking. 'Almost two and a half hours later, somebody said to me ‘your mum’s back’ and the hearse was outside. 'It was like a re-run of the morning and we went down the same route even going past the business again. 'Everyone was looking and you could see them doing a double take because they’d already seen us go past once. It was embarrassing.' Mrs Usher said that when they returned to the cemetery the workers were still digging the grave. Farcical: The blunders of cemetery workers ruined Mrs Jone's funeral at Glossop Cemetery (pictured) and left her family devastated. The council has since apologised for the mistakes . 'When we got to the gave we found that the workmen had not dug down very far,' she said. 'When the coffin was being lowered it went in at a slant. 'The head of the coffin was about three inches from the top of the ground and the bottom of the coffin was about 10 inches from the top. 'She shouldn’t have been taken down like that, we watched as the top went in on a slant it and it was sticking up. I was at the front crying, I was very upset. Mrs Usher said that everybody present at the funeral was 'mortified,' by what happened. 'I still feel physically sick it shocks me that much,' she said. 'At the end of the day these people can apologise all they want but it is not personal to them, it was not their mother. 'My mum did not deserve that and it should not happen to anyone. It is going to be something which people always chat about but not for the right reasons.“It is not going to be remembered with people saying ‘wasn’t it a nice funeral’ but instead ‘can you believe what happened. Enquiries revealed cemetery bosses had mistakenly dug up the grave of Anne’s father wrongly believing Mrs Jones was going to be buried with him. High Peak Council’s Executive councillor for community services Anthony McKeown said: 'We have apologised unreservedly to Mrs Usher for the distress caused by the events surrounding the burial of Barbara Jones. 'We have offered to meet the entire cost of the funeral, and have introduced procedures to ensure that mistakes of this nature do not reoccur. 'The new procedures mean that no one person has sole responsibility for taking burial details from funeral directors and for issuing work to cemetery staff. 'As a result, measures are now in place to ensure that all stages of the booking process are checked and that grave digging instructions are issued to staff correctly. 'The grave of Mr Jones was re-turfed as soon as possible after the day in question and will continue to be monitored. 'Meanwhile, the grave of Barbara Jones has been tidied in readiness for the kerbs to be reinstated. A formal letter of apology has been written to Mrs Usher.'","Cemetery bosses had mistakenly dug up grave of Anne Usher's father .

Nick Clegg last night issued an extraordinary apology to the nation for breaking his pre-election pledge to block any rise in university tuition fees. In a high-risk move, unprecedented in recent political history, the Deputy Prime Minister took to the airwaves to admit he never should have made the promise. The abject nature of his statement, ahead of the Liberal Democrats’ annual conference, which starts this weekend, dramatically divided opinion at Westminster. Scroll down to watch . Admission: In a high-risk move, unprecedented in recent political history, Nick Clegg took to the airwaves to admit he never should have made the promise . Critics said Mr Clegg, whose leadership has been under pressure as his party flatlined in the polls, had succeeded in reminding voters of a U-turn that had begun to fade in the public’s thoughts, while appearing weak. But his allies insisted he had made a personal decision to try to draw a line under an issue that had become a ‘ball and chain’ around his neck, demonstrating his determination to lead the party into the next election. They claimed voters would regard it as refreshing that a political leader had made a direct apology for a mistake. Mr Clegg joined all other Lib Dem MPs in signing a pre-election pledge to ‘vote against any increase in fees’. But in coalition with the Conservatives, the party backed a decision to almost triple fees to £9,000 a year within months of the election. The move infuriated many Lib Dem supporters, particularly students. It triggered an incredible reversal of fortune for Mr Clegg, who had been treated like a rock star on the election trail after his performance in TV debates. I'm sorry: Nick Clegg, pictured talking to teenagers at the St Andrew's Youth club in Westminster on Wednesday, made the extraordinary apology in a TV piece . In a message filmed in his south-west London home, to be shown as a party political broadcast next week, Mr Clegg insisted he would ‘never again’ make a pledge unless he was totally clear it could be met. 'There’s no easy way to say this: we made a pledge, we didn’t stick to it – and for that I am sorry' Nick Clegg, Deputy Prime Minister . He admitted many voters had ‘strong and pretty mixed reactions to some of the things Liberal Democrats have done in government. Many of you tell me you’re glad that at a time of real economic uncertainty, we put aside our political differences to provide our country with stable leadership. ‘But, I also meet people who are disappointed and angry that we couldn’t keep all our promises – above all our promise not to raise tuition fees.’ He went on: ‘There’s no easy way to say this: we made a pledge, we didn’t stick to it – and for that I am sorry.’ Mr Clegg accepted his apology ‘won’t be enough for everyone’. ‘But I owe it to you to be upfront about it,’ he added. ‘When we’re wrong we hold our hands up. But when we’re right we hold our heads up too. Critical: Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman said 'instead of crying crocodile tears, he (Nick Clegg) should vote with Labour to bring these tuition fees down' ‘We were right to leave the comfort of opposition to face the realities of government. ‘And I know we are fighting for the right things, day in, day out, too: rebuilding our economy to make it strong; changing the tax system to make it fair; defending the vulnerable in these tough times.’ 'This was Nick Clegg’s key election promise when he asked people to vote for his party. Instead of crying crocodile tears he should vote with Labour to bring these tuition fees down' Harriet Harman,Labour’s deputy leader . Senior party sources said Mr Clegg had decided to make the apology over the summer. Several of his advisers are understood to have advised against the move, with others saying he should address the issue in his conference speech instead. But one well-placed source said: ‘He happens to think that the issue [tuition fees] is being used as shorthand or a kind of alibi for people to just stop  listening to the good stuff we are doing. We hope it will at least earn us a hearing again.’ Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman said: ‘This was Nick Clegg’s key election promise when he asked people to vote for his party. Instead of crying crocodile tears he should vote with Labour to bring these tuition fees down.’ Labour suggested a cut in tuition fees could be paid for by raising taxes on banks, though the Tories say the Opposition has made multiple spending commitments using that money several times over.

One of the policewomen murdered in cold blood may have made a desperate attempt to Taser their killer moments before they were gunned down, it emerged last night. A 50,000-volt stun gun was found on the ground at the scene of Tuesday’s bloodbath and detectives are trying to establish if either PC Fiona Bone or PC Nicola Hughes tried to discharge it. The non-lethal weapon was out of its holster, prompting speculation that one of them had grabbed it before being killed in the gun and grenade attack. Scroll down for video . From above: An aerial picture of the scene of the shooting of Pc Bone and Pc Hughes in Hattersley . Tragic: Pc Fiona Bone (left), 32, and Pc NIcola Hughes (right), 23, who were shot dead on a routine call . Such was the speed and ferocity of the ambush, officers doubt that the pair had any chance to defend themselves. The officers were lured to their deaths after being called out to investigate what turned out to be a bogus report of a burglary, leaving them at the mercy of a murderous police-hater. The Taser – which fires barbed darts with copper cables attached which paralyse suspects for a short time – is a key line of inquiry as investigators try to establish exactly what happened. The twist emerged as: . Greater Manchester Police confirmed they had found a Taser which was being carried by one of the officers at the crime scene in Hattersley, Greater Manchester. A senior source said: ‘It may well be that one of these officers bravely tried to tackle the gunman with the Taser. Respectful: Police officers stand in a line to read floral tributes at the scene where the shootings happened . Shock: Members of the public hug each other as they lay tributes to Pc Nicola Hughes and PC Fiona Bone . Tributes: Two men bring flowers to the spot closest to where PC Nicola Hughes and PC Fiona Bone were killed . Support: Officers help a man in a wheelchair bringing flowers to the scene where the two policewomen died . An ambulance service crew arrives in Hattersley, Tameside, to leave a tribute to the fallen police officers . ‘It was found lying on the ground out of its holster and we are trying to ascertain whether it had been discharged or not.’ A 28-year-old man was yesterday arrested in Hattersley on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. 'It may well be that one of these officers bravely tried to tackle the gunman with the Taser. It was found lying on the ground out of its holster and we are trying to ascertain whether it had been discharged or not' Police source . Cregan, 29, is also being questioned over the officers’ deaths and the killings of father and son David and Mark Short earlier this year. He handed himself into police a short while after Tuesday’s murders. A desk officer at a local police station kept him talking while an armed unit was scrambled to the scene and he was arrested. Police were today granted more time to question Cregan. Greater Manchester Police chief Sir Peter said officers remain under threat after the deaths of the two policewomen. He said he could not be sure all the explosive devices had been recovered from the area where they were attacked. ‘We are not confident that we have recovered all the grenades, we don’t know for certain, so we’ve made it clear to our officers that the threat is still there,’ he said. Investigation: Police forensics staff work near the scene in Greater Manchester where two unarmed female police officers were killed in a gun and grenade attack, which led to the arrest of a wanted man . Scene: Pc Nicola Hughes, 23, and Pc Fiona Bone, 32, were killed whilst investigating what turned out to be a false report of a burglary . ‘I would want that to be the message. This has been a long-standing criminal feud between different outfits in Manchester and in the Tameside area (of Greater Manchester).’ He said that the force had issued Osman warnings – notices given to people under threat of being murdered or seriously injured – to ‘a large number of individuals’. Sources denied children were among them. Sir Peter reiterated that the force had no prior intelligence about the address in Abbey Gardens where PCs Bone and Hughes were sent to investigate a bogus report of  a burglary. There was nothing to indicate a greater than normal threat, he said. 'We are not confident that we have recovered all the grenades, we don’t know for certain, so we’ve made it clear to our officers that the threat is still there' Sir Peter Fahy, Greater Manchester Police chief . The chief constable confirmed that Cregan was on bail over a fatal pub shooting at the time of Tuesday’s double murder. Mark Short, 23, was shot dead at the Cotton Tree pub in Droylsden, Greater Manchester, on May 25. In June, Cregan was arrested in connection with this death and released on bail. Sir Peter said there had been insufficient evidence to charge Cregan over the death and he had to be released. He added: We often get to a point where there is not enough evidence to justify a charge and therefore a person has to be released under the time limits set by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. ‘That is what happened in this particular murder which led to Cregan and others being bailed while further inquiries were made on a large number of fronts until we reached a position where there was enough evidence for the Crown Prosecution Service to authorise a charge for murder.’ The post mortem examination for both officers has concluded that they died as a result of gunshot wounds. It had not been known initially if shrapnel from the grenade had played a part in their deaths.

A cosmetic surgery center in Maryland has been closed by health officials after three liposuction patients developed severe infections, one of which subsequently died. The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene on Wednesday ordered the closure of Monarch Med Spa in Timonium after the procedures, which took place from mid-August to mid-September. The three patients contracted severe invasive Group A Streptococcus, or GAS, infections. Scroll down for video . Site of infection: This medical spa in Maryland has been shut down by health officials after three women developed infections that killed one . Procedure: Each of the three women had undergone liposuction at the center found breaching 'standard inspection control practices' around mid-August to mid-September . Though those infections are generally considered mild, they can be fatal in cases in which the bacteria, often found in the throat or on the skin, infects the lungs or blood. The closure came a day after health officials visited the Baltimore County location and found breaches in 'standard inspection control practices,' according to a written order mandating the shutdown. The inspection control unit at the University of Maryland Medical System reported Monday that three patients seen for procedures at Monarch Med Spa within the last six weeks had developed the infections. Symptoms of the infections include fever or influenza-like syndrome; redness at a wound site; abrupt onset of generalized or localized severe pain and swelling, often rapidly increasing; and progressive dizziness, weakness and confusion. Others: The company also has locations in Pennsylvania ¿ in Philadelphia, Harrisburg and King of Prussia ¿ and in Greenville, Del., according to its website, pictured . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says between 9,000 and 11,500 cases of invasive GAS disease occur annually in the United States, and that there are between 1,000 and 1,800 deaths per year.

Sea change: Less people are getting married and having children in Britain as people would rather just live together . British family life has changed for good as people are now just as likely to live together and have a baby as they are to get married. Cohabiting is no longer the 'trial run' it was for most couples, as for the first time the number of married couples with children equals those in the same situation who refuse to tie the knot. Last year 38 per cent of cohabiting couples were parents, exactly the same ratio as married couples with children. It proves far fewer Britons now believe the traditional view that children should be brought up in a home with married parents, despite evidence clearly showing that many more married couples stay together when compared to unmarried ones. Experts at Leeds University, working for Co-operative Legal Services, found the number of married couples with children at home has crashed by 320,000 in the last decade. The report, using data from the Office for National Statistics, also shows that unmarried couples in the same situation went up by 290,000 in the same period - up a third. The number of lone parent families has also rocketed - up more than 200,000 in ten years. Christina Blacklaws, Director of Family Law at The Co-operative Legal Services, said: 'There are all sorts of different reasons why people cohabit but one of the important aspects of this report is that it shows how socially acceptable it is as a way of forming a family. 'That was always a taboo in days gone by – you might live together, or ‘live in sin’ as a precursor to marriage but what the research now shows is that for the majority of people it is fine if people chose together and have children. 'For me as a lawyer the big issue here is that despite that level of acceptance, people still labour under the complete misunderstanding that if you are in an unmarried family the law is going to protect you.' 'Cohabitation is not just seen as a . ""trial run"" before marriage and children, but, for an increasing number . of people, as a replacement for marriage as a setting for both long-term . relationships and the raising of children,' the report says. Although married couples are still in the majority, just over one in three cohabiting pairs now have children, exactly the same number as those who are married. Kate Pinder lives with her partner, Colin Kennedy. They got together in May 2009 and had a daughter, Erin, in May 2012. 'Having been through a long term relationship which didn’t work but we tried to make work by planning a wedding, I am much more relaxed with Colin. Our relationship just feels right, so I don’t feel that I need to be married,' she said. 'It’s not that I am against marriage and, in fact, Colin and I probably will get married, not least as I want the same surname as Erin. However, I definitely didn’t feel that I needed us to be married in order to have a child.' A poll in the report by YouGov also found that only a quarter of people interviews believe they should be married before having a child. But more than half thought it was more important to be in a 'committed relationship' - showing that living together is now seen as much more practical. By contrast 53 per cent thought it was not important provided the parents were in 'a committed relationship' while a combined 42 per cent said they had no desire ever to get married or would do it simply to reduce the cost of living.","For the first time unmarried couples with children are now at the same level as married couples in the same situation .

Gunmen turned a quiet London street into a Quentin Tarantino movie scene with a dawn shoot-out outside a birthday party. Two men died and another survived being shot six times at point-blank range in an act of revenge outside Sugar Lounge nightclub in Forest Gate, east London as one of the gunmen took ‘the law into his own hands’. Gunman Michael Smith was found guilty of murdering two men and given two life sentences  with a minimum term of 34 years at the Old Bailey. Shot point-blank: Kevin Powell, right, shot Michael Smith, left, six times, once in the head, after Smith shot dead two men outside a nightclub . After shooting Eugene Brown, 27, and Patrick Ford, 36, outside the nightclub, Kevin Powell chased him through a suburban street and shot him repeatedly six times, including once in the head. He was found guilty of attempting to murder Smith, following a retrial, and jailed for 34 years. The mayhem started on May 29, 2010 when Brown fired four bullets into the ceiling of the nightclub during the party. He was then followed out of the club by Smith and Nana Oppong, whose birthday celebrations it was. Guilty of murder: Smith was chased down the suburban London street, pictured, but miraculously survived being shot by Powell. Smith did get two life sentences for killing the two men outside the night club . Chilling CCTV: Powell was captured on CCTV holding a gun as he chased Smith down the street. He was found guilty of attempting to murder Smith, following a retrial, and jailed for 34 years . Smith shot him and Mr Ford, who died at the scene, despite being surrounded by party-goers who had spilled out onto the pavement after shots were fired in the club. Mr Brown died six weeks later in hospital. Powell then chased Smith down a suburban street and shot Smith at point-blank range six times, once in the head. During the attack, Smith still managed to get up and run, before being shot at a second time and then diving into an open car window before being dumped in the doorway of a hospital. At least 24 bullets were fired at him, some becoming embedded in houses with one going through a living room window. Much of the terrifying crime was captured on CCTV which was played to the jury. Jail time: Smith, left, was found guilty of murdering Eugene Brown and Patrick Ford outside the nightclub, before he was chased and shot by Powell, right, in an act of 'revenge' Unemployed Smith, 28, of Canning Town and student Powell, 37, of Harlesden stood trial together today. William Boyce, QC, prosecuting, told the . jury: ‘Mr Smith must be one of the most fortunate men alive, he has no . right to be alive. ‘Mr Powell had taken the law into his own hands and had gone out to exact his own revenge. Shot dead: Mr Ford was shot dead by Smith after he fired four bullets into the ceiling of the nightclub during the party . ‘Mr Powell went after Mr Smith and caught up with him in a side road and shot him several times at virtually point-blank range. ‘He peppered Mr Smith with bullets but still did not manage to kill him.’ Judge Brian Barker, the Common Serjeant of London said: ‘This was a brutal and callous use of powerful weapons in London streets with a complete indifference to the results. ‘These were acts of revenge done in the streets with complete disregard for the public.’ Smith and Powell were also given concurrent ten-year terms for the firearms offences. Oppong, 32, a cleaner, of Stratford, was previously cleared of murder and a firearms charge after two juries failed to reach verdicts but he was jailed for two years after being found guilty of perverting justice. Two women working at the Sugar Lounge were found guilty of perverting justice and were jailed in September, last year. Dajsha Stancillas, 31, of Forest Gate, removed bullet casings from the floor of the Sugar Lounge and was jailed for a year. Camilla Ghimpu, 26, also of Forest Gate, got rid of the bullet cases after being handed them by Stancillas, her boss and received six months in jail. Brown’s friend Nerissa Harris, 29, of Chingford, was found guilty of perverting justice for taking a gun from Mr Brown after he was shot. She placed it in a car and it was then spirited away by a man who has never been identified. She was jailed for 18 months.

Turning the tables: DJ Adam 12 spoke in support of the Obama campaign and urged voters to do what they can to support the President following a fundraiser hosted by Beyonce and Jay-Z on Tuesday in New York . The soiree, set against a 350 bottle champagne tower worth $105,00, was attended by 100 people. It took place after Obama spoke to 200 donors at a . $12,500-per-family reception at the Waldorf Astoria. The total campaign . cash haul for the day was $6 million. DJ Adam 12 - otherwise known as Adam Bravin - is part of duo She Wants Revenge along with Justin Warfield who lined up tunes for the glittering New York bash on Tuesday evening. Bravin told MTV: 'I think it sends an important . message for Jay-Z and Beyoncé to throw this fundraiser... that it's . important for people that support the president to actually support the . president.' He admitted that not everyone can afford to throw a multimillion-dollar fundraiser like Obama's A-list friends, but added: 'Everybody can do something, whether it's make some phone calls, knock on doors, have a little party of your own, throw a club, whatever it is you can do in whatever town that you're in, you should be doing that if you actually do support the president and you want him to be re-elected'. Campaign spin: DJ Adam 12, in action on the decks, is a firm believer in Obama's message . Friends in high places: President Obama chats up Beyonce and Jay-Z at the $105,000 New York City champagne fundraiser the couple threw for him on Tuesday night . At the 40/40 Club, the singer Beyoncé introduced Obama and said that she and her husband Jay-Z 'believe in his vision'. Obama said: 'Let me just begin by saying to Jay and Bey, thank you so much for your friendship. We are so grateful. Michelle and Malia and Sasha are mad at me because they are not here. 'That doesn’t usually happen. Usually they’re like, we’re glad you’re going – we don’t need to go. But every time they get a chance to see these two they are thrilled, partly because they are just both so generous, particularly to my kids. And Malia and Sasha just love both of them.' Obama added that Beyonce 'couldn’t be a . better role model for our daughters because she carries herself with . such class and poise'. $105,000: The champagne tower at the Tower 40/40 Club that costs twice the average income of a US family . Classy: Obama told the guests, including Solange Knowles, seen arriving for the event (right), that he couldn't think of a better role model for his girls than Beyonce, because of her 'poise' (pictured  with Jay Z last month) 40/40 Club: Obama also compared himself to Jay-Z at the event, saying he knows'what my life is like. We both have daughters, and our wives are more popular than we are.' He then compared himself to Jay-Z. 'Jay-Z now knows what my life is like. We both have daughters, and our wives are more popular than we are. So we’ve got a little bond there. It’s hard, but it’s okay.' Like him, Beyonce and Jay-Z came from humble backgrounds, he said. 'And the good thing about so many of us here – and I know, I speak for Jay and Bey – is we remember what it’s like not having anything, and we know people who were just as talented as us that didn’t get the same break, the same chance. 'We remember some of our parents or grandparents who came here as immigrants and got a little bit of help along the way to go to that school or be able to start that first business.' Celebrity circles: The President also appeared on Letterman last night where he said he stands up for 'ALL America' following the 47% furor over Romney's secret tapes . Both Obama and his opponent Mitt Romney are frantically holding fundraisers even in the final stretch of the campaign to raise to avoid being swamped by attacks ads.

Jerry Sandusky's plan to take the witness stand at his trial was foiled after his adopted son came forward and told prosecutors the former Penn State assistant football coach had abused him, it has emerged. Trial transcripts posted online on Friday reveal that Sandusky was forced to remain silent during his child sex-abuse trial because of concerns over his son's allegations. 'Mr. Sandusky had always wanted to . testify on his own behalf. He always wanted to tell people his side to . the allegations in this case,' said defense lawyer Joe Amendola. Matt Sandusky's (left) revelation that he had been abused by his stepfather contributed to Jerry Sandusky (right) being found guilty of sexually abusing ten boys . 'That potential evidence, whether true . or not, was so devastating' that Sandusky felt he could not run the risk . of testifying and subjecting himself to questions about Matt, he . continued. Matt Sandusky, whom the defense had originally planned to call as a witness, abruptly switched sides late in the trial, approaching prosecutors and offering to testify that he too had suffered abuse at the hands of his father, the transcript shows. Prosecutors planned to call Matt as a rebuttal witness if Sandusky testified in his own defense, the transcript shows. They later backed off, but wouldn't agree to a defense request to refrain from asking Sandusky about his son's claims on cross examination. Amendola argued for a mistrial, saying 'it was such an integral part of our case that Mr. Sandusky testify that we feel we have really put ourselves in a tough situation with the jury.' Prosecutors objected and Judge John Cleland agreed, telling Amendola that trials have a way of throwing legal strategies into disarray. Matt Sandusky went to live with Sandusky and his wife, Dottie, as a foster child and was adopted by them as an adult. Shortly after the former coach's arrest in November, Matt Sandusky's ex-wife went to court to keep her former father-in-law away from their three young children. Jill Jones successfully obtained a restraining order forbidding the children from sleeping over at their grandparents' home. Jerry Sandusky leaves the Centre County Courthouse in handcuffs after his conviction in June at Bellefonte, Pennsylvania . Sandusky was convicted in June of 45 . counts of sex abuse involving 10 boys. Prosecutors said some of the . assaults took place on the Penn State campus. The 68-year-old Sandusky, given his . age and the serious nature of the crimes, is likely to receive a . sentence that will keep him in prison for life. He is jailed pending . sentencing and maintains his innocence. Judge John Cleland has scheduled a morning . hearing at the courthouse in Bellefonte to determine if Sandusky should . be classified as a sexually violent predator, a designation that . subjects a convict to intense reporting requirements upon release. An . assessment board has recommended Sandusky for the designation, though . it's expected to have little practical effect since he stands to die in . prison.

A woman who was allegedly raped by a high-risk sex offender in a popular New York City park has revealed how she pleaded with her attacker to let her go. In a harrowing interview, the victim said she looked deep into her attacker's eyes and begged him to stop. It has also emerged that suspect Jonathan Stewart, who was arrested nearby, attempted suicide in the lockup at Manhattan Criminal Court as he waited to face charges. In custody: Jonathan Stewart is taken away by police after his arrest on suspicion of raping a woman in a popular New York City park this morning . The 25-year-old was rushed from the . cells to Bellevue Hospital after trying to hang himself at about 10.40am . on Sunday morning, the New York Post reported. 'He’s lived with himself doing this so . long, it’s surprising that now it has become too much,' his alleged . victim told the Post after hearing about the attempt. The woman, an unnamed actress from . Tribeca, today revealed how she asked him to think about his mother or . sister before he launched his assault. According to the New York Daily News, . the 21-year-old woman asked him: 'How can you do this? Don't you have a . mother and sister?' She claims her attacker then looked at her and replied: 'They're dead. Shut up.' Detectives lead homeless Stewart from the police station: The suspect was on parole after last year being released from a seven-year sentence for robbing and assaulting a woman in 2004 . The woman described how she was in a . reflective mood when she went to the Hudson River Park at about 5.15am . on Saturday in search of solitude. She had been sitting on a bench when . she was allegedly approached by Stewart - a registered Level III sex . offender released from prison last year - who sat down beside her and . began a conversation about her iPhone. The actress said Stewart's eyes were bloodshot red and, sensing danger, she got up to walk away. However, she was dragged into nearby bushes where she was beaten, choked and raped . She told the New York Daily News: 'It was a nightmare... it seemed like it lasted forever.' Describing how she begged her attacker to stop, she added: 'I'm a good person, I was trying to get on his moral side.'

Homeless Stewart, who was released . from prison in 2011 after serving a seven-year sentence for robbing and . assaulting a woman in 2004, was arrested by NYPD officers nearby. He has since been charged with rape, sex abuse, assault and forcible touching. His victim, an actress who won roles . on television after moving to the city four years ago, was taken to the . Beth Israel Medical Center where she was given medical treatment before . being released. The woman told the New York Post how . she found it 'sickening' when she found out her alleged attacker was . still on the street despite being previously convicted of another sex . crime. She told the local how she felt 'lucky . to be alive' adding: 'I'm in pain, but trying to stay positive and keep . my mind off of it. I've been sleeping a lot.' Police sources described the woman as a . 'true victim' and a 'really good girl' who had been enjoying the park's . tranquillity before the attack happened. The two Park Enforcement officers who . gave chase after the victim ran to them also today told of their part . in the capture of the suspected rapist. Officers Daniel Murphy and Luis Cabezas told The Tribeca Trib they had just come on duty at around 5am when the screaming victim came running toward them. 'She . ran towards us completely naked,' Officer Murphy said, describing how . his colleague immediately ran after the suspect while he helped her into . the back seat of their car and gave her a blanket. 'She was distraught, . very distraught,' he added. Officer . Murphy told the Trib how the suspect lay on the ground, shirtless and . silent when he was cornered by them and officers of the NYPD about a . block away on the West Street Median at North Moore Street. Only about three minutes passed between their finding the woman and apprehending the suspect, the policeman added. The Daily News reported that Stewart, who had been on parole until July, was also taken to hospital after his arrest.

A group of city officials yesterday held a rally and march through the Hudson River Park to express the community's outrage at the sex attacks. At the 'Take Back The Park' demo, city council speaker Christine Quinn said that sexual predators will not be tolerated by the local community. 'We are not going to yield one blade of grass, one acre of park to perpetrators who think women are going to live in fear,' CBS New York quoted Ms Quinn as saying.

A hearing will be held next month on whether Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel, who was convicted of killing a neighbor in 1975, should be released from prison, a state official said Monday. Skakel's first parole hearing has been scheduled for October 24, John DeFeo, executive director of the Connecticut Board of Pardons and Parole, told The Associated Press. Skakel is eligible to be released next March if the three-member board approves it, DeFeo said. Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, is serving 20 years to life for fatally beating Martha Moxley with a golf club in Greenwich when they were 15-year-old neighbors. Skakel is a nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel Kennedy. Michael Skakel is serving 20 years to life for fatally beating Martha Moxley with a golf club in Greenwich when they were 15-year-old neighbors. Pictured here in court in January . Moxley's mother, Dorthy Moxley, said she would oppose Skakel's release. 'If it were up to me, I'd leave him in jail for the rest of his life,' she said. A message left with Skakel's attorney wasn't immediately returned. Skakel was convicted in 2002. He is eligible for parole consideration because of laws in place at the time of the crime such as good behavior credits, officials have said. In March, Skakel lost his bid for a reduction in his prison sentence. A three-judge panel rejected Skakel's request, saying there was nothing inappropriate or disproportionate about the sentence. The 52-year-old Skakel insisted on his innocence at the hearing, citing so-called truth serums he has taken that are used to help people remember. Martha Moxley was just 15-years-old when she was brutally murdered . Daddy's girl: Pictured here with her father, David Moxley . 'Give me a polygraph,' Skakel told the judges. 'I've passed three sodium pentathol tests. I don't know what else to say.' Skakel has had a troubled life - after his mother died from brain cancer when he was only 13 and he turned to alcohol. By the age of 18 he was causing trouble and was treated for alcoholism. A 1998 book re-opened the Miss Moxley case and suggested that Skakel was the killer. Aged only 15 at the time of the murder, Skakel had said he was at his cousin's house at the time of the murder, but later said that he had been masturbating in the tree house the night before the victim's remains were found in the same spot. Other reports suggested that Skakel was jealous of his brother, Thomas's relationship with Miss Moxley. And, according to former neighbor Gregory Coleman, Skakel had bragged: 'I'm going to get away with murder. I'm a Kennedy.' Members of both the Skakel and Moxley families were in the courtroom as Skakel said he prayed for Moxley's mother, Dorthy Moxley every day. Thomas Skakel, left, was going out with Martha Moxley in 1975 and young Michael, right, was alleged to be jealous . 'I told Mrs. Moxley if I killed Martha I would take responsibility for it,' Skakel said. 'I didn't commit this crime.' Dorthy Moxley rejected Skakel's claims of innocence. 'I truly believe he is the one who murdered Martha,' she said. 'I'm sure he's the one who swung the golf club.' Moxley said she will ask her friends to write to the parole board. Asked about the impact of the crime, Moxley said, 'When you lose a loved one, it just never goes away.' The state Supreme Court ruled in 2010 against Skakel's bid for a new trial, saying a claim implicating two other men in the killing wasn't credible. Michael Skakel was arrested in 2000 and convicted of murder in 2002 . Grisly: One of the exhibits presented at the original trial . The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case. Skakel has a habeas corpus appeal pending in state courts, accusing his trial attorney, Michael Sherman, of doing a poor job, a claim Sherman has rejected. He harshly criticised the lawyer who was jailed himself last March for a year-long sentence for tax evasion, and said he was shocked once he obtained new lawyers after his conviction to realise 'how absolutely incompetent Mr Sherman was in everything he did. 'I trusted Mickey Sherman,' he said in January 2011. 'He's in jail.'

'Outrageous discrimination': The Duke of Westminster, a former head of the TA, has accused British firms of refusing to employ Army reservists because of their part-time military role . The former head of the Territorial Army has criticised British firms for discriminating against reservists by refusing to employ them because of their part-time military role. Foreign-owned firms are more likely to employ people who are in the TA, with some even paying their wages while they are on active service, the Duke of Westminster said. But he said the prospect of losing staff to training and active service in Afghanistan meant British firms were less likely to hire TA soldiers, which was also hitting recruitment. The Duke, the country's wealthiest British-born individual, said servicemen and women should not have to declare their service when applying for jobs, as they currently do, and suggested that firms employing reservists should receive National Insurance breaks. 'There is undoubtedly discrimination against someone who at interview says he is in the Territorial Army,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'These days when you have to tick the boxes on the interview sheet, one of the questions is ""Are you in the Territorial Army?"". '[But] we are not allowed by legislation to say: ""Are you pregnant? Are you about to be pregnant? Are you white? Are you Muslim?"" 'Why is it there? It is the most outrageous form of discrimination. It has been mentioned to me by my soldiers on more than 100 occasions.' The Duke spent more than 40 years in the Territorial Army before retiring with the rank of Major General at the start of the month. He has an estimated fortune of £7.35billion thanks to his central London property empire, according to this year's Rich List from The Sunday Times. 'Mentioned more than 100 times': The duke said companies were being put off hiring TA soldiers because they may need time off for training or be deployed on active duty . The Territorial Army will play a greater role in British armed forces in future years as the regular Army is cut from 102,000 to 82,000 and reservist numbers doubled to 30,000 under the Army 2020 plan, the biggest restructuring of the service for decades. The Duke told the Daily Telegraph some U.S. employers in Britain even continue to pay reservists on active service. He told the paper: 'Our overseas employers are better than the English employers - I am talking about French, Japanese, Americans and others. 'All those countries had national service or its equivalent right up to two or three years ago, so there is a service culture built in.' He said British employers should realise TA troops made a 'lifestyle choice' to join, that choice being 'to go out there and be shot at'. He added that when he raised the idea of National Insurance cuts for firms employing TA soldiers to the Ministry of Defence he was told to 'rein my neck in'.","Duke of Westminster claims companies fear losing staff to training and active service .

The boyfriend and personal chef of the late Wall Street investor Christopher Browne are locked in a vicious legal battle over the legendary moneyman's $300 million estate. In court papers filed this week in Manhattan, Joseph Ouellette, who worked for Browne for 18-years said that the broker's jealous partner Andrew Gordon had swindled him out of almost $4 million that was left to him by Browne in his will. The suit alleges that Gordon, who is 14-years Browne's junior, took advantage of his boyfriend's failing health to push his favourite chef Ouellette out of a job, out of his home and leave him with nothing after the investor died of a heart attack aged 62, in 2009. Christopher Browne (left) began a relationship with Andrew Gordon (right) in 2003 and left his partner over $100 million in assets when he died of a heart attack in 2009 . Filing his lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court, Ouellette compared Gordon to a cross between Richard Gere's character from the 'American Gigolo' and Claus von Bulow, the British socialite who was famously acquitted of killing his American heiress wife in 1980 and who was played by actor Jeremy Irons in the 1990 movie 'Reversal of Fortune'. The suit says that Gordon, who is now 51, manipulated Browne to take every penny he could from him, even though he was going to inherit most of his estate including his $75 million East Hampton property and his $25 million Park Avenue apartment. Chef Joseph Ouellette has filed a lawsuit against the boyfriend of the late Wall Street investor Christopher Browne seeking at least $4 million in damages . Classically trained chef Ouellette called architect Gordon 'a cross between the American Gigolo and Claus von Bulow' and alleged that he connived to leave him with nothing to show for 18-years of service to Browne. The court filing says that a 1999 version of the will that Browne drew up left $4 million to his long-time personal chef who also claims that he was a confidant to the successful investor who counted billionaire Warren Buffet among his clients. However, after Browne began dating Gordon in 2003, Ouellette claims that the former chief of value investment firm Tweedy Browne changed his will to leave his boyfriend with $100 million and reduced his chef's share to $500,000. Court papers also show that Browne was willing to leave his chef with the East 57th Street apartment that he had bought for Ouellette and his family. It was in 2007, that the will changed again after Browne suffered an accident and a severe head injury. Ouelette says that his share of Browne's $300 million will was reduced to only $100,000 and a provision that he could stay in the Midtown Manhattan apartment for six-months and only if he was still employed by Browne. But just weeks before Browne suffered a fatal heart attack in 2009, aged 62, Ouellette was fired and he and his family were ordered to leave the building - the suit alleges that he firing was 'on Mr. Gordon's say-so'. Andrew Gordon (left) and Christpher Browne seen here in 2008, a year before the investor died . 'It’s a shame that someone so loyal was treated so poorly by someone so rich,' said Ouellette’s attorney Tom Mullaney to the New York Post. Countering the claims made by Ouelette, Gordon said that his boyfriend was in complete control of his faculties during each will amendment and that he had not put any 'undue influence' on him to make changes. Long known as one of the most successful investors on Wall Street, Christopher H. Browne was known for buying up stocks that were at rock bottom and waiting for their value to soar before selling.

A party supporter wears badges created at the Liberal Democrat Annual Conference in Brighton . The 'I'm a PLEB!' badges are the biggest seller in Brighton . Mr Mitchell continues to face questions over what exactly he said to the police. Friends say he admits swearing, but denies using the word 'pleb'. But an official police log, leaked today, shows officers stand by their account of the row which happened last Wednesday when Mr Mitchell was told he could not ride his bike through the main Downing Street gates. The ‘I’m a PLEB!’ badges have been the biggest seller on the Lib Dem merchandise stand today, outstripping mugs, badges and magnets featuring the party’s MPs down the years.

Miriam Clegg has defended her husband for breaking away from Cabinet meetings to do the school run, saying men who do not spend time with their children should not become fathers. The wife of Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, said it was right that Mr Clegg was such a hands-on dad. In a rare interview, Mrs Clegg said: ‘Of course every man who has children should be involved in their lives, that’s why they have them. Couple: Miriam Clegg (left), the wife of Nick Clegg (right), pictured yesterday at Brighton Aldridge Community Academy, said it was right that he was such a hands-on dad . ‘If they don’t want to be involved, they shouldn’t have them, no?’ The Spanish-born lawyer, who goes by her maiden name of Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, dismissed the criticism her husband faced for going to great lengths to see his three sons. Britain was only just beginning to recognise the extra involvement men wanted to have in child-rearing, she said. Speaking of her law firm, Dechert, Mrs Clegg said: ‘In my team I have lots of young men who have children, and it’s not so easy for them to say ""My children are sick so I’m sorry, I have to take care of them, I have to stay at home"".’ She also revealed she had an army of helpers to enable the family to juggle work and childcare commitments. Admiration: Mrs Clegg dismissed suggestions that she was a role model for women, saying it was the low-paid working mothers who deserved praise . Mrs Clegg said she was able to rely on ‘a lot of shadows behind me making my life possible’, including a nanny ‘who is almost like my aunt and gives me orders’, her mother, Mr Clegg’s mother and colleagues. 'Of course every man who has children should be involved in their lives, that’s why they have them. If they don’t want to be involved, they shouldn’t have them, no?' Miriam Clegg . She dismissed suggestions that she was a role model for women, saying it was the low-paid working mothers who deserved praise. ‘The role model is the woman who is the shop attendant who is there from nine to five and the money she is receiving doesn’t allow her to pay for childcare and somehow she manages to give her children all the opportunities. Life is full of these kinds of exceptional women.’ Mrs Clegg added: ‘There is a tendency to think women in the City have a much more challenging life than other women. I don’t think that is the case - it’s probably the reverse. When the ""superwomen"" say ""everything is easy"" I think it is like when models say ""I don’t diet, I can eat whatever I want"".’ Assistance: Mrs Clegg also revealed she had an army of helpers to enable the family to juggle work and childcare commitments . Mrs Clegg also described the spoof music video of her husband’s apology for making a pledge on tuition fees as ‘genius’. The song has been released as a charity single to raise money for a children’s hospital in Sheffield. Mrs Clegg, a patron of the charity, said: ‘I have watched it - it’s genius. It’s very good - I’m very happy with that. “The more money they [the hospital charity] get, the better. I’m sure the kids would be really happy and I’ll go there to celebrate with them.’ Although she is likely to appear on the stage after her husband’s keynote speech at conference today, Mrs Clegg has refused to scale back her work commitments to appear in countless photo opportunities on the Lib Dem campaign trail. She said: ‘I love Nick, he is the father of my children, we are in life together, so obviously I will try my very best to help him. But I don’t think any of that should change me.'","Nick Clegg's wife says it's right that DPM is hands-on dad .

Andrew Mitchell and Nick Clegg have accepted thousands of pounds in donations from a company owned by an offshore firm in the tax haven of Jersey. The beleaguered Conservative chief whip was given three donations totalling £11,000 from Brompton Capital, the biggest corporate backer of the Lib Dems. The company has handed Mr Clegg’s party £777,000 since the General Election in 2010. Accepted donations: Conservative chief whip Andrew Mitchell, left, was given three donation totalling £11,000 from Brompton Capital, an offshore firm in the tax haven of Jersey, which has handed Nick Clegg's, right, party £777,000 as the biggest corporate backer of the Lib Dems . Tycoon backer: Rumi Verjee, in Brighton yesterday, is Brompton Capital's chairman and said to be worth £125m . Shares in the firm are owned by an offshore firm called Integro Nominees (Jersey) Ltd, which is based in the Channel Island tax haven. Brompton Capital’s chairman is Rumi Verjee, a tycoon said to be worth £125million, having founded Domino’s Pizza franchise in Britain. He now runs Thomas Goode, an exclusive china shop in Mayfair. Mr Verjee has been entertained by the Deputy Prime Minister at Chevening, his grace-and-favour country mansion, and was in the audience for Mr Clegg’s conference speech in Brighton yesterday. He repeatedly refused to respond to questions about why his company shareholdings were based in Jersey, or why he had donated money to both the Lib Dems and a senior Conservative. While all the donations were properly declared and there is no suggestion of impropriety on the part of the MPs or Mr Verjee, the revelations are potentially embarrassing for the Lib Dems and Mr Mitchell, who is fighting to save his job following claims he called Downing Street police officers ‘f****** plebs’. Both parties in the coalition have made much of their determination to crack down on tax avoidance. Only this week, Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander told wealthy people using offshore tax havens: ‘We’re coming to get you.’ Founded franchise: Mr Verjee made his money founding Domino's Pizza franchise in Britain . Brompton Capital’s accounts suggest it has been far from successful. The company made a loss of £19,000 in 2010 in accounts submitted in April that year – yet it was able to donate £250,000 to the Liberal Democrats in June 2010. The company filed losses of £357,000 in April last year – yet in the same month contributed £100,000 to Mr Clegg’s party. The firm’s principal shareholder, with 100,000 shares, is the offshore company Integro Nominees( Jersey) Ltd. Despite its chequered financial past, in the past ten years the firm has made ‘charitable donations’ of more than £12million. According to the Jersey Financial Services Commission, Integro Nominees (Jersey) has changed its name to EQ Nominees (Jersey). It is listed as one of the ‘regulated companies’ in the global TMF Group, which offers clients a wide-range of services, including ‘tax planning’. Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman said: ‘They claim to stand for fairer taxes in tough times, and talk about tax crackdowns on the rich. But in reality they’ve cut taxes for millionaires and one of their biggest donors appears to be using offshore companies to cut its own tax bill. It’s typical Lib Dem hypocrisy.’ A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘Liberal Democrats are committed to targeting companies and individuals who are using aggressive tax avoidance measures by hiding money off-shore. In some cases, there are legitimate reasons for global companies to not base themselves in the UK.’ Mr Mitchell said: ‘In opposition my office accepted three small donations from this UK company. These were fully declared to the Electoral Commission.’","Andrew Mitchell accepted £11,000 of donations from company Brompton Capital, owned by an offshore firm in tax haven Jersey .

Millionaire: Mandy Burgess, the aunt of murderer Kiaran Stapleton, is a EuroMillions jackpot winner . Ms Burgess, a mother of three who married into a notorious Manchester crime family, won the jackpot in a EuroMillions Raffle to celebrate the start of the London Olympics. 'Mandy can't believe her luck,' a source told the Sun. 'She's on holiday - celebrating big time.' Stapleton, 21, who is the son of Ms Burgess's sister Billie Jean, has been told he must serve at least 30 years in prison for the murder of Anuj Bidve, 23, on Boxing Day last year. He walked up to Mr Bidve, whom he had never met before, in the street in Salford, Greater Manchester, and shot him in the head at point-blank range. He admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility but was convicted of murder by a jury at Manchester Crown Court.

A woman who made more than 250 time-wasting 999 calls, swearing at phone operators and even making a threat to kill, has narrowly avoided being given an anti-social behaviour order (Asbo). June Chadwick, 53, would ring the police when drunk and report crimes she had read about in the paper or seen on the television, a court heard. She was given a six-month community order with supervision, and ordered to pay £35 costs. In court: June Chadwick made more than 250 time-wasting 999 calls, swearing at phone operators and even making a threat to kill . Chadwick's calls to the emergency services each lasted between one and 18 minutes, Oldham Magistrates' Court was told. But a district judge turned down a request for her to be given an Asbo, which would have meant she faced jail if she made another time-wasting call. Threatening: June Chadwick was warned that she would be given an Asbo if she made another time-wasting call to the emergency services . Chadwick, of Falkirk Street, Greenacres, Oldham, admitted using the public communication network to cause annoyance, inconvenience and anxiety. She made the calls between August 2010 . and October 2011. One of them, which was played to the court, included . swearing and a threat to kill. The court heard that Chadwick suffered from mild mental health issues and had delusional ideas. Chris Fallows, defending, said: 'Most of the calls were made because my client had a real concern that people in the UK were suffering and being killed by acts of violence. 'She had seen them on television and seen them in the paper and called the police. 'Her intention was to assist the police.' District Judge James Prowse said Chadwick’s condition would make it difficult for her to distinguish between a hoax and genuine call for help. But he warned that any further nuisance phone calls would see her almost certainly facing an Asbo. He told her: 'If it doesn’t stop, you’ll be back. 'If you carry on with these phone calls, . even if there is not a criminal prosecution, the court would certainly . make it (the order).' Chadwick's case was heard less than three weeks after another nuisance 999 caller avoided a jail sentence.

Officers arrested Adams after they traced the calls to her home in Fenton, Staffordshire. She appeared at North Staffordshire Magistrates' Court earlier this month and admitted persistently making use of a public communication network to cause annoyance, inconvenience or anxiety. She was given a 24-month community order with a supervision requirement, and ordered to pay £85 costs.

"PUBLISHED: . 19:35 EST, 29 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:36 EST, 29 September 2012 . Landscape gardener Patrick Norfolk had one last wish as the debilitating physical condition that had plagued him for years entered its final, terrible stages. He wanted to die in his garden among the flowers and plants he  had tended for decades, surrounded by his family. Patrick, 65, had been left a shell of his former independent, physically active self by motor neurone disease – an incurable illness that wreaks havoc on the nervous system and causes muscles to waste away. Overwhelmed by the disease’s relentless onslaught, Patrick did indeed try to take his own life at his home. But the attempt was unsuccessful and – unable to seek help from his wife Anne or anyone else because of Britain’s laws on assisted suicide – he took the agonising decision to end his life at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland. End of the journey: Patrick Norfolk with his family. Patrick travelled to Switzerland to end his suffering . Now, for the first time, Anne has decided to speak of her husband’s death in June in the hope it will reignite the debate over the ‘barbaric and archaic’ laws that robbed him of his dignity. Anne, 58, says: ‘Pat desperately wanted to die a peaceful death surrounded by his family in his garden, which was where he was happiest. Had he been able to have his wish, the last years of his life would have been so much more pleasurable, knowing he could have a dignified death. ‘Instead, Pat spent every single day worrying about how he could end his life when the time was right for him. He never wanted to die in a foreign country but because of the laws in Britain, he ultimately had no choice.’ It is not the only tragedy that Anne has suffered in recent years. In  February 2011, her youngest daughter Vicky committed suicide after struggling with depression. The 31-year-old shop assistant, who suffered from rosacea – a chronic skin condition that caused her face to redden – jumped off the Humber Bridge. At the time, Patrick’s condition was worsening by the day – and he was  particularly badly affected by Vicky’s death. Anne said: ‘Patrick had the  natural devastation of his daughter dying. But it was more difficult for him because of what he was going through. ‘After Vicky’s death, he was conscious that he didn’t want anybody to think what she had done was influencing him. ‘His mind to take his own life was made up from day one.’ Tragic: Anne Norfolk (right) has suffered two tragedies in recent years. In February 2011, her youngest daughter, Vicky, (pictured left) committed suicide after struggling with depression . Patrick had been diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2008, three years before Vicky died. Anne, who still lives in the home they shared in Swanland, near Hull, said: ‘The doctor at Hull Royal Infirmary diagnosed him and one of Pat’s first questions was, “How long have I got?” ‘The doctor said about two years. From the day he was diagnosed he said, “I will not see this through, I will take my own life.” It was soul-destroying for him. He was robbed of his livelihood and independence.’ Anne says their daughters Bridget, now 38, Colette, now 34, and Vicky were ‘shocked and devastated’ by the diagnosis. Patrick’s health continued to deteriorate and by December 2011 he was confined to a wheelchair – and it was at this point that he made his failed suicide attempt, while Anne was out shopping. She preferred not to discuss the details but said that Patrick had thoroughly researched it and was ‘convinced’ that it would work. As well as a note to his wife and family, Patrick wrote a letter to the coroner. In it, he said: ‘If an animal was left to die under these conditions a prosecution by the RSPCA or similar would follow  – are animals more important?’ Agonising decision: Patrick decided to end his life at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland (one building pictured) Anne recalled: ‘He didn’t want him or any of us to suffer any longer. He didn’t want us to go through the misery of watching him die. After his failed suicide attempt we had a soul-searching conversation and he came to the conclusion that the only way forward was Switzerland.’ Patrick contacted Dignitas in February. ‘He was given the green light in May and, from that moment on, it was as if a huge weight had been lifted off his shoulders,’ Anne says. The couple – together with Bridget and Colette – flew from Heathrow to Switzerland on June 24. Patrick was booked into the clinic four days later. Anne revealed that Patrick died outdoors surrounded by nature. She said: ‘In the end, we decided the girls should come with us to the entrance to the clinic but only I should go in. ‘First of all he took something to settle his stomach and then we sat chatting. We spoke about silly things like flowers. About an hour later he took a potion and had a glass of water to swill it down. I held his hands and we kissed and said we loved one another. ‘He got to die in the garden, not his own, but he was outside as he wanted to be. I’m still incensed he couldn’t die at home, in his garden as he wanted. The laws in this country are archaic and barbaric.’ Nearly 200 people from Britain have ended their lives at Dignitas since it was set up in 1998. But critics of assisted suicide argue that it is a violation of medical ethics. A spokesman for anti-euthanasia campaign group Care Not Killing said: ‘The message assisted suicide sends is that if you are terminally ill, disabled or less healthy,  your life is less  worthy than if you are young, fit and healthy. ‘The moment you start deciding whose life is worth saving and whose is not, you are on a slippery slope.’ Earlier this month, new Health Minister Anna Soubry said she backed changing the law on assisted suicide – under which offenders risk a sentence of up to 14 years – only to face calls for her resignation. The Motor Neurone Disease Association said: ‘We have a  neutral stance on whether there should be a change in the law.’","Patrick Norfolk suffered from motor neurone disease -  an incurable illness that affects the nervous system .

Ms Clinton, wearing workout gear and flip flops, strolled arm in arm with her husband around Madison Square Park in the Flatiron District. Leading the pack was the couple’s Yorkshire terrier Soren, which was given to Ms Clinton as a gift from her husband. Later, the 32-year-old hit the gym, wearing a muted outfit and neon trainers. And in the evening, Ms Clinton had a packed agenda. She wrote on Twitter Saturday night that she and Mr Mezvinsky were attending the Global Citizen Festival in Central Park, where the Black Keys, The Foo Fighters, Neil Young, and Crazy Horse performed. Dubbed the Global Citizen Festival, the concert also featured K'naan, John Legend and Band of Horses, with Young's performance capping off the evening.

Legend made a surprise appearance, playing one song, Imagine, at a piano on stage, a short walk from where the song's author, John Lennon, once lived. The five-hour show was a mix of tight sets from the bands, roughly an hour each, mixed with videos and information from guest speakers about global poverty-related problems like infant mortality and polio.

She said that after her wedding to Mezvinsky in 2010, she realised she had two choices – ignore the fame, or use it ‘to highlight causes that I really cared about.’ Clinton married her long-time boyfriend in an elegant ceremony in Rhinebeck, New York, in the Hudson Valley. The then-bride was notoriously secretive about her wedding plans, only revealing the date ahead of her nuptials. The blonde has been expanding her horizons in a number of ways. Last year, she became a special correspondent for the Brian Williams news show Rock Center. Of her television career, she said: ‘Historically, I deliberately tried to lead a private life in the public eye, and now I am trying to lead a purposefully public life.’","Couple took stroll around Madison Square Park with their dog Soren in tow .

Britain is poised to freeze aid to Rwanda amid fears that the country’s military is supporting rebels in Congo. International Development Secretary Justine Greening is expected to suspend support by the end of the year after the EU announced plans to freeze its £140million aid programme to the East African nation. She is understood to be furious with her predecessor Andrew Mitchell for reinstating £8million  of the payments on his last day in office against officials’ advice. Taking on the rebels: Congolese soldiers are fighting violent militias believed to be supported by Rwanda's military, sparking the expected suspension of £140m of British support to Rwanda . The US, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden have also suspended financial support over allegations the Rwandan military is backing a murderous rebellion in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo. In the past six months, the M23 militia group has driven 470,000 people from their homes and has been accused of killing and raping civilians. Its leader Bosco Ntaganda is wanted by the international criminal court for war crimes. Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame – who has been wooed by prime ministers including Tony Blair and David Cameron – has denied his country’s military is backing the rebels. Britain – the largest bilateral donor to Rwanda – had put £16million of aid on hold after the allegations surfaced in June. Frozen funds: As villagers take a break from working their fields in Rwanda, pictured, the US, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden have also suspended financial support . Mr Mitchell personally intervened to unblock half of Britain’s donation just six weeks later – reportedly against the advice of experts. The decision was made despite evidence from UN experts that Rwandan troops and weaponry were slipping across the country’s border to support the M23. Carina Tertsakian, of Rwanda for Human Rights Watch, said Mr Mitchell’s decision was ‘counter productive’. ‘It gave the signal everything was fine. It was premature,’ she added. Sources at the Department for International Development have indicated Mr Mitchell’s decision is likely to be reversed when the budget is reviewed in December. International Development Secretary Justine Greening is expected to suspend support by the end of the year . One said: ‘Justine Greening  will be looking very closely at the issue of budget support to Rwanda.’ Foreign Office minister Mark Simmonds told the UN yesterday: ‘There can be no possible justification for such support, whether in terms of military hardware, or strategic advice. It must stop. ‘And there can be no impunity for those who violate human rights.’ Conservative support for Rwanda was seen as the key to detoxifying the party’s image in the run-up to the last election. Mr Mitchell was responsible for founding Project Umubano, which sent many MPs and Cabinet ministers to Rwanda and Sierra Leone to help with building projects. Mr Kagame has been repeatedly wooed by Labour and Conservative politicians and even addressed the Tory party conference in 2007.Rwanda relies on foreign aid for roughly 40 per cent of its budget. Jean Michel Dumond, the EU’s ambassador to Congo, said on Wednesday: ‘It was agreed to freeze budgetary assistance and to not agree to any supplementary budgetary credit for Rwanda without them giving signs of co-operating.’ Yesterday at the UN, Mr Kagame rejected allegations that Rwanda was supporting the rebels and hit out at the West for cutting aid. ‘Solving the crisis will be impossible if the international community continues to define the issue  erroneously,’ he said.","Britain is expected to suspend support to Rwanda by the end of the year .

And one Newcastle United Football Club fan has taken that saying to extreme lengths by creating an astonishing 8ft stained glass window which illustrates the emotions of a die-hard supporter. John Hardisty, 64, of Benton, Newcastle upon Tyne, got the idea to create the window in his garden shed after fans protested when the club’s stadium St James’ Park was renamed the ‘Sports Direct Arena’ last November. Magpies fans described the . decision to . use owner Mike Ashley’s sports firm in the new name for the ground, . where football has been played since 1880, as a ‘nightmare’ and . ‘abysmal’. Mr Hardisty said: ‘I saw the reaction of fans outside St James’ Park when it was announced that it was going to be renamed. Then I saw this guy holding a protest poster, which he’d made out of felt-tip pen. ‘It said: “Football is my religion. St James’ Park is my church”. My idea came from that really. Football, especially Newcastle United, is a form of religion up here. ‘I saw some images on the internet and started to draw my own from there. It took about two months for me to draw and then create the window.’ Mr Hardisty said he put striker Papiss Demba Cissé - a £9million signing from German side Freiburg in January - ‘at the top as Jesus Christ on the cross and then the rest as the disciples’. ‘It’s all symbolic, but fun as well,’ he added. Cissé, who has made a huge impact since joining Newcastle, is revered on Tyneside after scoring 13 goals in 14 games last season, and helping the club qualify for the Europa League.

Mr Hardisty became interested in stained glass windows when he was a child but only began making them about 15 years ago while he owned the Hardisty Cycles shop in Byker, Newcastle upon Tyne. The football fan - who has also created a stained glass project based on the industrial revolution - sold the shop 10 years ago and went travelling to Russia where he met his future wife, Tatiana. He added: ‘It was about eight years ago that I started making stained glass windows seriously and devoted some time to it. It is still a hobby but I do sell a few. Backlash: Fans described the club's decision to use owner Mike Ashley's sports company in the new name for the historic ground, where football has been played since 1880, as a 'nightmare' and 'abysmal' ‘I’ve lived in the same Edwardian house for about 30 years and it’s got quite a big garden, so I built a summer house there to make the windows. I work in a big hut at the bottom of the garden.’ 'I saw this guy holding a protest poster, which he’d made out of felt-tip pen. It said: “Football is my religion. St James’ Park is my church”. My idea came from that really' John Hardisty . John owned his cycle store for more than 20 years and expanded onto the site of a 16th century property next door. There was a 1,500 sq ft room above, which he turned into an art gallery. He added: ‘The bike shop made money, the gallery didn’t. It was always more of a hobby. So, you could say I have an artistic background. ‘I don’t know what theme I’m going to base my windows on next. Something beginning with 'r', so maybe romance?’","John Hardisty, 64, of Benton, Newcastle, built window in his garden shed .

A woman was astounded when workmen who came to replace her kitchen floor found a fully plumbed bath tub underneath. Lynette Musgrave had lived in the house in Halifax, West Yorkshire, for 12 years without realising the bath was there. It was not even discovered when she had her laminate flooring replaced a year ago, after her washing machine leaked, because it was covered by concrete. Hidden depths: Lynette Musgrave was shocked when workmen fixing her kitchen floor found a sunken bathtub underneath . It was only when they returned after a second leak made the floor dip in the middle that the fitting was found. And there was a second surprise for Mrs Musgrave when her insurance company said the bath had caused rot damage, which was not covered by them because it pre-dated the start of her policy. She was forced to pawn jewellery and her laptop to raise the £900 needed to replace her floor. 'When they told me they had found a bath tub I couldn’t believe it,' she said. 'I had no idea it was there. 'I’ve had to pay two sets of excess to have the insurance company come out and do the work twice, and now they’re refusing to finish it.' Kitchen calamity: Rosie Kennington had the entire floor cave in when she moved into her new house earlier this year - and her insurance company said she would have to cover the £24,000 herself . Mrs Musgrave said she had suffered stress and lost sleep as a result. 'I’m not looking to get compensation, but I pay building insurance every month and I just want them to replace the floor.' A spokesman for Swinton confirmed that Mrs Musgrave is liable to pay for the damage herself, but that they would refund the £200 increase in her excess as a 'goodwill gesture'. In March, Rosie Kennington and her partner experienced a similar shock after moving into their dream home. Within hours of their arrival, their whole kitchen floor caved in underneath them - and insurance company Direct Line told them they would have to find the £24,000 for repairs themselves.","Lynette Musgrave had lived in the house for 12 years without finding it .

According to new research from drinks brand, Lambrini, the ideal candidate has to be funny, friendly but shockingly, not too good-looking.

More than half of those quizzed said they deliberately choose ugly friends to make sure they get the pick of the fit fellas. While four out of ten want a pal there to rate blokes and strike up conversations. But when things go wrong, it seems it’s the wing woman’s duty to come to the rescue. A secret SOS phrase between pulling partners was the most popular mode of escape from boring blokes (45 per cent) followed by pretending to go to the bathroom (29 per cent). A further third admitted asking their wing woman to send them a fake ‘there’s an emergency text’ or communicating with hand signals when they wanted to get away from a less than scintillating suitor.

Young people who use sunbeds almost double their risk of developing the most deadly form of skin cancer, warn researchers. The risk rises by 20 per cent for people using a sunbed at any stage in their lives, according to new estimates. As a result, tanning devices could be responsible for triggering malignant melanoma in more than 400 Britons each year - with 100 dying from the disease. Warning: Young people who use sunbeds almost double their risk of developing the most deadly form of skin cancer, researchers say . A stark warning from European specialists about the perils of sunbed use comes after figures showed the number of over 50s suffering melanoma has tripled in 30 years. Experts blame the rise of tanning salons and cheap holidays to the sun which boomed in the 1970s. The latest study, published in the British Medical Journal, says the toll from sunbed use is likely to increase as cancer takes several years to develop and young people fail to heed health warnings. Dr Mathieu Boniol, of the International Prevention Research Institute, Lyon, France, who led the study, said 'tougher actions' were needed to get the message across. He said 'The burden of cancer attributable to sunbed use could further increase in the next 20 years because the recent, high usage levels observed in many countries have not yet achieved their full carcinogenic effects and because usage levels of teenagers and young adults remain high in many countries.' Malignant melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer, with almost 13,000 Britons diagnosed in 2010. Tragically, it is the fastest growing cancer in young people and the most common cancer in women in their 20s. Melanoma, which is linked to sun damage, is treatable if caught early but patients who develop metastatic disease - where the cancer has spread - are rarely cured with chemotherapy. Just five per cent are still alive five years after diagnosis, with around 2,000 people dying each year. Deadly: Melanoma (pictured) is treatable if caught early but patients who develop metastatic disease - where the cancer has spread - are rarely cured with chemotherapy . In the new study, researchers looked at data from 27 studies conducted between 1981 and 2012 involving 11,428 cases of melanoma. It showed the risk of developing the cancer increased by 20 per cent for those who had ever used an indoor tanning device with ultraviolet light. But the chances of developing melanoma shot up in those people who started using sunbeds before their 35th birthday - with the risk almost doubling. The study estimated the use of sunbeds leads to almost 3,500 cases of skin cancer and 800 deaths every year across Europe. It suggested there were 444 cases and 99 deaths attributable to sunbed use in Britons - with the toll four times higher in women than men. The researchers pointed out that the dangers of indoor tanning have only recently been recognised. 'Powerful ultraviolet tanning units may be 10-15 times stronger than the midday sunlight on the Mediterranean sea, and repeated exposure to large amounts of ultraviolet A delivered to the skin in relatively short periods (typically 10-20 minutes) constitutes a new experience for humans,' said the study. The researchers called for tanning under the age of 18 to be restricted, and unsupervised tanning salons to be banned - laws that are already in place in Australia and several European countries. They accuse the sunbed industry of giving 'information intended to deceive consumers'. 'The sunbed industry has used the opportunity to claim that properly regulated indoor tanning is safe, and that it might even have health benefits' they said. In the UK, scientists at the Health Protection Agency say sunbeds should never be used by the under 18s. Changes to the law in England mean those aged under 18 cannot use tanning salons or sunbeds at commercial premises, and restrictions also apply in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.","Tanning devices could be responsible for more than 400 cases of malignant melanoma in Britain each year .

A boy who suffered a heart attack at the age of two was saved after doctors HOOVERED a deadly blood clot from his heart . Albert Tansey has become the only child in the world to have the procedure, where a mini-vacuum is used to clear out the blocked artery and restore blood flow. It is regularly performed on adult heart attack victims but was previously unheard of in children. The two-year-old has now been discharged from Leicester’s Glenfield Hospital and is recovering with parents Annita and Adam at home in Burbage, Leicestershire. Pioneering: Albert just after heart surgery at nine months (left) and now happy and active (right) Scientists were able to suck the blood clot out of the heart in under half an hour . Mrs Tansey, 37, said: 'The doctors were so excited. They were all just amazed. They said it’s never been done before on a child. There are no words to explain how we feel about them and all the staff at the hospital. 'They have saved his life. It’s lovely he’s back home and we can be a family again.' Albert was born with Hypoplastic left heart syndrome, where the left side of the heart does not form properly. At a week old, surgeons at Glenfield Hospital operated on his heart and he had further open heart surgery nine months later. Doctors were pleased with his progress and were not due to see him until later this year. But a month ago, Albert suddenly collapsed at home after suffering chest pains. Full-time . mother Annita said: 'The night before we had been to a party in aid of . the charity we set up after Albert’s diagnosis. Some of his doctors were . there and everyone kept saying how good he looked. 'The . following morning, I was sat talking to a friend in the kitchen when . his brother came in and said Albert didn’t feel very well. 'He was grey and sweating. He kept saying: ‘it hurts’ and when I asked where he pointed to his heart.' Thank you: Albert and his mother Annita who is grateful to Dr Frances Bulock and the other medics who saved her son's life . His terrified parents immediately called for an ambulance and he was rushed to Leicester Royal Infirmary Hospital. The youngster was connected to a heart monitor and the readings were sent to Albert’s team of doctors at Glenfield. They spotted ‘something they didn’t like’ and he was quickly transferred to the intensive care unit at Glenfield. Adam, 38, an insurance broker, said: 'Within an hour of getting there they realised he had heart failure. We were told the heart gives out a chemical when you are having a heart attack. A nursehad the reading on her hand and showed the doctors. 'They were in disbelief. It’s so rare for a child to have a heart attack.' Albert was given shots of clot busting drugs while doctors battled to save him. That evening, his parents were given the devastating news that he may not survive and if he did, he may need a heart transplant. Over the next couple of days, they faced an agonising wait as doctors tried to stabilise his heart. Annita said: 'It was awful. He was going through hell. All we could do was sit by his bed and hope for a miracle. 'You would do anything for your child just to make them better. The doctors then had a discussion and told us they wanted to try putting some dye in Albert’s heart to see if there was a blockage. 'We knew that there were huge risks to any intervention because Albert’s heart function was so poor, and therefore anaesthetic was not really ideal, but we felt the only option was to have hope, be positive and give him the best chance of the best quality of life.' Albert as a baby with his siblings (left to right) Charlie, George, Fred and Emily. Albert's heart did not form properly in the womb . Albert pictured at nine months old - his heart function improved immediately after his latest procedure . Albert’s surgeon Mr Peek then came to his parents to say they had found a blood clot and asked for their permission to remove it. Adam said: 'We didn’t really hesitate. We have ultimate respect and huge amount of confidence in the team who look after Albert so when we met with Mr Peek it felt right to go with the procedure as success would give Albert the best chance.' Luckily, the adult cardiac team is based alongside the children’s unit and Dr Albert Alahmar, a consultant adult interventional cardiologist, was asked to be on hand. Although it had never been done before on a child, it was agreed the best option was to perform a percutaneous coronary intervention, where the clot is sucked out of the heart. Adam said: 'About 25 minutes later, another doctor came back with the blood clot in his hand. He said: ‘We’ve done it. It’s amazing’. 'Then the room was full of doctors. There was an all round feeling of relief and excitement. 'Not just for what this has done for Albert and the hope it gave to him, but what it meant for the future. 'We met Dr Alahmar the next day and he told us how excited he was about this. How paediatric cardiologists would learn from this and it could help others. 'It felt special that our Albert had been part of something so big, and his life will go onto help others in the future.' Albert’s heart function immediately improved and after 11 days in hospital he was allowed home. It is still not known what caused the clot but he will continue to be monitored regularly and will have to be on medication for the rest of his life. The couple, who also have four other children, Charlie, 16, George, 14, Emily, 12 and six-year-old Fred, are campaigning to keep the children’s cardiac care unit open. Delight: Albert with his parents who faced an anxious wait to see if the pioneering surgery would work . Albert with his father after he had surgery at just 10-days old . Under current plans, it is due to close and patients from the East Midlands will be transferred to Birmingham Children’s Hospital, Newcastle or London where there may not be an adult unit. Dr Albert Alahmar, consultant adult interventional cardiologist at Glenfield Hospital, said: 'The procedure is called percutaneous coronary intervention, where the clot is removed to unblock the artery and allow the blood to flow back again through it. 'I regularly perform this procedure on adults for patients presenting with acute heart attack. 'As far as I and my colleagues are concerned, this has never been done on a child as heart attacks in children are rare. This is unchartered territory. 'It is a risky procedure because failure to aspirate the clot under general anaesthesia may result in death. It is more likely to be fatal for children with a condition like Albert’s because he has a single chamber, where any damage by a heart attack is magnified. 'It really is remarkable. At Glenfield Hospital, we have an excellent relationship between the adult and paediatric cardiologists, allowing such rare cases to be treated exceptionally well.' Dr Frances Bu’Lock, Albert’s paediatric cardiology consultant, said she was very pleased with Albert’s progress. She said: 'His heart function improved dramatically by the end of the procedure. 'It’s not back to normal yet but there is a very good chance he will get better for his third operation in a year’s time. 'It’s great to see him running about and playing.'

A little girl who developed kidney failure after twice battling cancer made a miracle recovery after her organ healed itself. Emily Clark has now been cancer-free for five years - and the landmark date means it is unlikely to return. The nine-year-old had a kidney removed after her first brush with cancer and then the remaining kidney failed after she had intensive treatment to battle the cancer a second time. But doctors were startled when the organ began to heal itself. Recovered: Emily Clark, 9, (left and aged four, right) has been cancer-free for five years. She was on kidney dialysis for 18 months before her organ seemed to heal itself . Emily is now the picture of health and her parents Claire and Stuart, from Newcastle, are planning a big party to celebrate the end of a very traumatic time. Claire, 34, who works as a pharmacy dispenser, said: 'I told her ""You have beaten both the cancers that were there and I don’t think they will come back"", but I still don’t think she fully understands what a big deal this is. 'It’s just wonderful.' Emily was first diagnosed aged just two, when experts detected a Wilms’ tumour, a rare form of cancer found inside a kidney. It appeared she was recovering well after having the kidney removed and four months’ of chemotherapy, but a routine check-up 10 months later revealed the disease had returned. Mrs Clark said: 'She was diagnosed again on the day after I had had her sister Lily, who is now five, and when they said ""it’s back"" our whole world collapsed. 'For a year we were all practically living on the ward at the RVI. And this cancer was a mixture of two types of cancer which they had never seen happen before. Emily Clark (left) with her parents and younger sister Lily. Emily was first diagnosed with a tumour aged two . 'It was a total newbie so they held lots of meetings to decide on her treatment - they had to get it right so we didn’t mind, and it means they can use this course of treatment if it happens to anyone else. 'From a mum’s point of view it was awful and I just wished I could swap places. There were times when she was very, very poorly. 'She had 10 months of chemotherapy and they really blasted her to make sure they killed all the bad cells, and there were some awful side effects. 'She developed mucositis, which stripped the lining of her throat and mouth so badly she couldn’t talk, and she lost her fingernails, toenails and her hair, and that bit she found very hard - not a very confident little girl at all. Emily Clark, 9, (right) pictured with little sister Lily has one functioning kidney . 'We had pink bandanas for her but people used to mistake her for a boy, which really used to upset her.' To add insult to injury after the intensive treatment, Emily’s remaining kidney failed, leading to her having dialysis for 18 months. Claire was ready to donate one of hers when doctors found Emily's kidney was functioning again and since then she hasn’t looked back. Two trips away without Claire or Stuart, 41, a roofer - one to Lapland and one to Scotland - have further boosted her confidence. And from now, Emily only needs to take medication for her kidney and a nightly growth hormone injection. She also only needs to visit the Long Term Illness Clinic at the Royal Victoria Infirmary once a year, but her mum has opted for six-monthly visits for now, for extra reassurance. Claire said: 'It is a mum thing. I am not ready yet to go once a year, so I want her to be checked over more regularly. 'Sometimes I have to remind myself that I am the mum because she’s so much more grown-up than other nine-year-olds and so blase about the whole thing. 'It is her 10th birthday in September and we are going to have a big party with all our friends and family who have gone through this with us. 'She is a little miracle.'",Emily had one kidney removed during first battle with cancer. Second kidney failed after treatment for second bout of the disease .

Tragic: Catherine Furey, pictured, tried to have an abortion by drinking super-strong vinegar but died after suffering a violent reaction . A pregnant mother-of-five died after drinking industrial-strength vinegar during an attempted home abortion she had researched online. Catherine Furey, 38, suffered a violent and eventually fatal reaction to the concentrated acid similar to that used in a chip shop. A police investigation was launched and officers arrested her sister-in-law Dawn Chadwick for handing her the vinegar bottle in late 2010. She was eventually charged with manslaughter but after an 18-month investigation this was dropped this week, allowing the details of this tragic case to be revealed for the first time. Mrs Furey's family said today they then suffered ‘a second tragedy’ when Mrs Chadwick, 33, was later charged with manslaughter for allegedly helping Mrs Furey abort the baby. But Mrs Chadwick, a mother-of-four who has learning difficulties, was finally cleared of any wrongdoing following an 18-month investigation. It is thought Mrs Chadwick took the bottle of vinegar out of a cupboard and passed it to Mrs Furey, who then took it into another room and drank it. Catherine may have researched using vinegar for an abortion on the internet and after trying it was rushed to North Manchester General on December 1, 2010, where she died. Her sister-in-law was arrested seven months later in July 2011 and charged with unlawfully supplying a poisonous or noxious substance with the intent to cause the miscarriage of a woman. In January this year prosecutors raised the charge to manslaughter and Mrs Chadwick was facing a trial at Manchester Crown Court. But now, after reviewing the file, the CPS has dropped the case against her. Last night Mrs Furey’s husband Craig said that he was too upset to talk about the tragedy. Accident: Mrs Furey was taken to North Manchester General Hospital where she died in December 2010 . And Dawn Chadwick’s family said she should never have been charged. Her solicitor Alex Preston said: 'Catherine died in tragic circumstances. 'From the outset, her family made it abundantly clear to both the police and the CPS that they did not blame Dawn for Catherine’s death. Indeed, Catherine’s sister described her prosecution as a ""second tragedy"". 'Dawn was devastated by her friend’s death. Abortion specialists have warned that there are dozens of myths on the internet about how to terminate a pregnancy. They said that any woman wanting information about abortions should speak to their doctor, trained medics or abortion clinics. Natika H Halil, Director of Information Services from the Family Planning Association, said: 'We know that there are many myths and misinformation about abortion on the internet, that’s why it’s so important to use trusted sources to gain accurate information on how to access abortion services.' 'Dawn has significant learning difficulties and should never have been charged with the initial charge of supplying a noxious substance to cause an abortion. Despite this, the CPS actually elevated the charge she faced several months later to manslaughter and it is not until now - a full 18 months after Catherine’s death - that her name has been cleared. 'Dawn is extremely relieved that her ordeal is finally over. She and the rest of the family would now like to be left alone to grieve.' The case against her was dropped as they had little evidence apart from elements of Dawn Chadwick's police interviews. Kevin Rogers, from the CPS, said: 'This was a tragic case, the consequences of which sadly led to the death of Catherine Furey. 'A decision was made to charge Mrs Chadwick with manslaughter; this was the correct decision at that time. 'The law in that regard is clear and against us proceeding on the basis of the interview alone, leading us to the conclusion that there is no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. 'The family of the deceased have been made aware of the decision and have expressed understanding of the position.'","Catherine Furey suffered a violent reaction and was rushed from her Salford home to hospital but she died .

Desperate: A friend said 63-stone Georgia Davis had moved away from her parents in an attempt to lose weight . A 63-stone girl who had to be rescued from her own home had previously moved away from her parents in a desperate attempt to lose weight, her friend and former housemate has said. Georgia Davis, 19, moved in with friend Jade Tarrant but put on weight after she returned home to care for her sick step-father. Miss Tarrant revealed today how Miss Davis's weight went from 18 stone to 63 stone as she returned to her bad habit of eating junk food. Miss Tarrant, 19, said: 'I always knew it was going to get this bad if she went home again. 'She’d come to live with me because of all the stress. Being with the mum and her step-dad got so stressful. 'She just wanted a break - she wanted some girly time. 'She would have lost weight if she stayed with me because I like my salads and I could have got her on it. 'But she missed her mum and step-dad. She ended up going back and putting her own health at risk.' Miss Davis moved out of their shared home in Aberdare, South Wales, to move back into her parents' home three miles away after her step-father was diagnosed with lung cancer. She tried to be good daughter as her mother struggled with osteoporosis, Miss Tarrant said. Friends: Jade Tarrant (left) lived with Georgia Davis (right), but Miss Davis put on weight again after moving back in with her parents . But the stress led to her returning to a diet of cakes, chips, burgers and chocolate, washed down by sugary fizzy drinks. Miss Tarrant added: 'If she’d stayed with me her life would have been good, she would have been happy and not had a so many problems on her mind. 'It was the strain of caring for her ill parents which made her eat - it was eating as a way of coping.' She thinks the world of her mum, she loves her and she loves her step-dad - she’s been through a lot. 'I like my salads and I could have got her on it': Jade Tarrant said she could have helped Miss Davis lose weight again . 'Her mum’s osteoporosis and her step-dad’s lung problems had a large impact on her. 'It went wrong when she moved back in with them, she was under a lot of stress and it put her back on the same spot. 'She went back to eating fatty foods and having huge portions every time we went out for a meal.' Miss Davis eventually stopped venturing outside altogether and, by the time a 40-man emergency team cut her free, she had not left the house for about eight months. The teenager is being treated for a range of obesity-related problems at hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales. She is suffering from complications including diabetes and kidney failure, as well as problems with her spine, joints and skin. Doctors and obesity experts have put her on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet to help her lose weight. Jade, who is currently pregnant with her first child, said: 'When I saw the situation I was in shock. I broke down and started crying. Major operation: It took 40 people to rescue Miss Davis from her home after she fell ill last week . 'I didn’t even realise it was her, It didn’t look like her, she looked so unhappy. 'I had a fear inside me that something would happen one day but never expected this. 'I really want Georgia to get well and get out of hospital so she can come and see me and my baby.' A hospital spokesman said: 'Georgia is still undergoing investigations and receiving treatment from a range of health professionals. 'We are pleased to advise that her clinical condition is stable.'

A woman, her boyfriend and their friend who battered another woman and forced her to clean up her own blood in an hour-long ordeal have been jailed. Paula Donaghy and boyfriend Mark Green, along with accomplice Edward Whitelock, subjected their victim to 57 separate injuries in a 'vicious, sustained and humiliating attack'. The female victim, who has not been identified but moved in with Donaghy a week earlier, was punched up to 40 times and kicked, had a glass smashed over her head and even had Donaghy’s dog bite her arm, a court heard yesterday. Vicious: Paula Donaghy (left) and boyfriend Mark Green (right) subjected their victim to 57 separate injuries in one hour . During the prolonged and merciless attack, she was dragged around the room by her hair and arms, stripped semi-naked and had a knife held to her throat. She was also battered across the head with a pipe from a vacuum cleaner and had her jaw broken during the late-night hour-long attack in Donaghy's flat in Middlesbrough. The victim had been set upon after a drink-fuelled row in which Donaghy falsely told the two men that the victim had been making derogatory remarks. Accomplice: Edward Whitelock was also jailed for four years for his part in the 'humiliating' attack . Her injuries included a badly-gashed head, two black and swollen eyes, a fractured jaw and broken nose, a lost a tooth, and a knife mark to her neck. The trio, who all admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent, were jailed for a combined 13 years and four months. Instigator Donaghy and boyfriend Green received prison terms of four years eight months, while Whitelock was sentenced to four years. At some point during the late-night February ordeal at Donaghy’s home the victim passed out, Anthony Moore, prosecuting, told the court. Mr Moore said one of the drink and drug-fuelled attackers held their fingers to her neck, and told the others: 'I think she’s dead.' In a statement to police, the victim said she recalled hearing from her groggy state, someone saying: 'Let’s finish her off and put her in the gulley.' After she came around, a door was barricaded with two kitchen chairs and she was given a cloth and spray to clean the blood-spattered room. Donaghy’s barrister, Duncan McReddie, said: 'She does not recognise herself in the behaviour quite properly described by the prosecution. A judge at Teeside Crown Court told the group that they 'didnt know when to stop' during the attack in February . 'She is shocked and appalled at the injuries sustained by the victim. She is equally shocked and appalled her behaviour led to those injuries.' Ian West, for Green, 20, and 18-year-old Whitelock’s lawyer, Andrew Turton, said the pair were remorseful for their parts in the incident. The judge, Recorder Michael Smith, told them: 'When you set about people in this way, particularly in drink, in effect, you don’t know when to stop.'","Paula Donaghy, Mark Green and Edward Whitelock subjected victim to 'humiliating' attack .

Casey Anthony was never guilty of murder, or even of lying to police, because she was mentally ill and unstable when she sent detectives chasing after her two-year-old daughter, a new book claims. Anthony's attorney, Jose Baez offers that stunning assessment in Presumed Guilty, Casey Anthony: The Inside Story, due out July 3. Mr Baez gives an inside look at the explosive trial from one of the people who knew it best -- including a description of the elaborate trickery involved in sneaking Anthony away from court after her acquittal so that reporters couldn't follow her. Casey Anthony cries with her attorney Jose Baez after she was acquitted of murder charges at the Orange County Courthouse on July 5 . He also supplies some intimate details: Anthony's first meal out of jail was a cheeseburger, fries and milkshake from Steak 'n Shake. Mr Baez said detectives should have realised Casey Anthony had built a 'fantasy world,' and her lies weren't evidence of guilt but signs of someone with 'serious mental health issues'. Anthony is serving probation for an unrelated charged at an undisclosed location in Florida. She couldn't be reached for comment yesterday. Describing how Anthony led detectives on a wild goose chase, even taking them to Universal Studios where she falsely claimed she had a job, Mr Baez writes, detectives 'should have stopped and realised, ""Wait a minute, we're not dealing with someone who is playing with a full deck""'. Anthony originally told detectives that her daughter, Caylee, was taken by a babysitter in June 2008, and that she didn't report her missing for more than a month because she was searching for the toddler on her own. Anthony had been accused of murdering her two-year-old daughter Caylee in 2008 and was found not guilty of manslaughter in the first degree . Insider: Jose Baez (left) was the lead defense lawyer for Casey Anthony (right). He claims Anthony lied about her daughter's death because she was mentally ill and unstable . Criticism: Mr Baez (left) and Cheney Mason (right), address Judge Belvin Perry . During Anthony's trial last year, Baez . argued that the little girl accidentally drowned in the family swimming . pool while Anthony and her father, George, were at home. Anthony . panicked from the traumatic effects of being sexually abused by her . father and George Anthony hid the body, according to the defence . argument. George Anthony denied the defence's allegations that he abused Casey and helped her cover up Caylee's death. Tell-all: Mr Baez gives an insider's look at the Casey Anthony case . Prosecutors had contended that Anthony suffocated Caylee with duct tape because she wanted to be free to hit the nightclubs and spend time with her boyfriend. Jurors acquitted Anthony of first-degree murder but convicted her of four misdemeanor counts of lying to investigators. Mr Baez repeats the allegations of sexual abuse in greater detail in the book, saying it contributed to Anthony's mental health issues. Mark Lippman, an attorney for George Anthony, refused to comment on the book yesterday because he hadn't read it. Anthony's defence contemplated having her testify until the very end of the trial but then decided it wasn't necessary. 'We had everything to lose and very little to gain,' Mr Baez writes. Mr Baez doesn't say where Anthony currently is hiding but he provides a . glimpse of the first few hours after she was released from jail last . July, time mostly devoted to eluding the media. After escorting Anthony . out of the Orange County Jail and into a waiting SUV, Mr Baez rode with . Anthony to a parking garage where five cars driven by members of the . legal team were waiting. Mr Baez and Anthony got into one car which departed the garage at the . same time as the other four. Each car drove in a different direction so . reporters following Mr Baez and Anthony wouldn't know which one they were . in or where they were heading. Mr Baez and Anthony then drove to a municipal airport where a private . plane took them to the Florida Panhandle resort community of St George . Island. There, members of their legal team and their families met up with . them. Anthony then went to New York until she had to return to Florida . to serve her probation sentence. Hiding: Anthony is currently serving jail time for unrelated charges at an undisclosed location. She has hidden from the public ever since her acquittal . Gone: Anthony's toddler daughter Caylee, whose body was found in woods near Anthony's home in 2008 . Mr Baez takes aim at the reporters who covered the case, detectives who investigated it, 'groupies' who attached themselves to it and the case's original judge who Mr Baez says filed a complaint against him with the Florida Bar. The complaint was later dropped. Prosecutor Jeff Ashton undergoes the harshest criticism by Mr Baez, who calls him 'a coward' for not showing up at Anthony's sentencing for the misdemeanors since he was making the talk shows round after the trial. Mr Baez is critical of many of Circuit Judge Belvin Perry's rulings during the trial but praises the judge for allowing him to pick a fair jury. The three-year case took an emotional toll on Mr Baez, according to his book. He suffered depression after the complaint was filed against him and he found it difficult to find joy in his wife's pregnancy. Mr Baez also criticises the way he was portrayed in the media as an inexperienced attorney taking on one of the highest-profile criminal cases in recent memory. 'The public may have been convinced that I was an idiot but I let it all roll off my back,' he writes.","New book gives inside look at explosive trial from Anthony's defense lawyer .

This is the army of workmen putting the final touches to London's streets for the Olympics as they paint fast-track lanes reserved for V.I.P.s. Dozens of men in fluorescent jackets were dispatched along 30 miles of road around east and central London to daub the iconic rings and white lines on the tarmac. By the early morning rush the workers - believed to have numbered at least 100 - had disappeared. But in their wake they left fast-track lanes that ordinary drivers will be hit with £130 fines if they dare to venture in to. Scroll down for video . Paint job: Workmen start marking Games lanes along the Olympic Route Network in central London last night. Members of public cannot drive in them from July 27 to August 12 . As Londoners slept, workmen marked the . 30 miles of tarmac which will be out of bounds to motorists between July . 27 and August 12. Although not operational until two days before the Olympics, the Games Lanes are shaping up to be one of the biggest irritants to those living in the capital. Used to crawling along the city's clogged narrow streets, motorists will now have the added insult of watching 80,000 athletes, officials, sponsors and media moving freely in chauffeur-driven vehicles on the specially designated lanes. The high-profile guests will travel glide through the busy streets using the Olympics Games Lanes. Adjustments to traffic lights will begin this week. 'I think it is unreasonable to expect London to have road closures and places closed off - people still have to get around,' said Steve Dixon, 45, a retailer from south London. 'I don't think London is being considered.' The fight for space is likely to be so keen that some taxi drivers are threatening to leave their car keys at home and go away. 'I think it's going to be a nightmare - I won't be able to get around, the roads will be blocked,' said taxi driver Scott Rawlings, 45, his black cab idling as he waited to pick up a customer in central London. Workmen peel off a stencil used to paint the markings and underneath the iconic rings are revealed . A hard nights work: Workmen peel off the last bits of white paint from the markings, and right, stand back to admire their work . Sprint finish: The men pack up their tools as some members of the public look on at the lanes, which they will be fined £130 for driving in . 'People don't like sitting in the back of a cab when it's not moving.' The Olympics Rings-marked lanes, which run alongside lanes for general traffic, will only come into operation on Wednesday July 25 - two days before the Olympic opening ceremony, with 'ordinary' drivers allowed to use them until then. The lanes have been dubbed 'ZiL lanes' after the Russian-built ZiL car that carried Soviet Union leaders around. There will be 30 miles of Games Lanes in London, with the lanes forming part of the 109-mile Olympic Route Network (ORN) which links Games venues. Yellow route: . Roads on this route will have a dedicated 'Olympic-only' lane for . athletes, officials, VIPs, sponsors and media. The lanes will be in . force from 6am until midnight. Red route: . Roads on this route, the busiest ""core section"" of the VIP network, . will be affected by major restrictions to speed up traffic but will be . fully open to the public. Measures could include bans on parking and . right-turns, suspension of pedestrian crossings, phasing of traffic . lights and no public entry from side roads. Blue route: . Roads on this route will only be affected on competition days. They . will run from the athletes' accommodation to venues such as Wembley . Arena, Earls Court and Wimbledon. Variable message signs along the lanes will state that drivers will be able to use them until July 25, although Transport for London (TfL) is advising motorists to avoid central London around the ORN and Games venues from mid-July. The exception to the free-to-use rule will be the Games Lane on the M4 near Heathrow which will start on Monday July 16 as the 'Games Family' - athletes, officials and the world's media - begin to arrive in big numbers. Before that there will be a reversal of traffic flow in the Kingsway Tunnel at Aldwych in London to assist traffic flows while on Friday July 20 further ORN work will be carried out, including the installation of barriers to simplify junctions. When the ORN and Games Lanes come into full operation on July 25, they will be enforced from 6am to midnight daily. Fast-track: A car zips along one of the lanes in front on the London eye. The roads will certainly not be this clear during the Games . V.I.P fast lanes: A car drives in an Olympics Games Lane on Upper Thames Street after workmen painted on the markings last night . Up to one million extra visitors are expected in London on each day of the Games and there will be up to 1,300 'Games Family' vehicles an hour travelling between key venues. A penalty charge of £130 will be issued to owners of vehicles who break the regulations, including driving in Games Lanes or stopping along the route, and any illegally parked vehicle will be removed to a vehicle pound and may incur a release fee of £200. The Games Lanes will end around two days after the Olympics finishes on August 12 and will not be in operation between the Olympics and Paralympics. A smaller Paralympic Route Network will come into operation shortly before the Paralympics start on August 29. Having dedicated routes to events became an Olympic priority after difficulties in the 1996 Games led to the venue in Georgia, USA, being dubbed 'the lost city of Atlanta'. London Mayor Boris Johnson said: 'Following the unveiling of the Olympic Rings on Tower Bridge, the Rings on London's roads really bring home how London has begun its transformation into a massive sporting and cultural venue. 'The ORN is a requirement of all host cities and is vital in ensuring athletes, officials and the world's media get to their events on time. 'My team slashed its length by one third of what had been planned and we're working hard to introduce changes to the road network as late as possible, to minimise the impact on Londoners and businesses. 'But with the Games less than one month away, we're into the home straight and are working flat out to ensure we are ready to welcome the world.'","£130 fine for driving in Olympics lanes between  July 27 and August 12 .

Alan Rosser, 61, watched 60 videos, downloaded 12 movie clips and looked at 4,988 of the pictures, which contained 'animals' and 'adults'. But Rosser, who worked as a PCSO for Lincolnshire Police, claimed he had only begun to look at the sickening images 'out of curiosity' after watching a documentary about people having sex with animals.

However, he said he looked at the pictures out of curiosity . Rosser, described as popular and hardworking, had been a PCSO since 2003 but quit his job after his computer was seized during a raid at his home on December 14, 2010. Sentencing him at Lincoln Crown Court on Monday, Judge Michael Heath said Rosser 'didn't understand it to be illegal' to download or view the material. Rosser, of Welton, near Lincoln, pleaded guilty to six charges of possessing extreme pornography. He was given a three-year community order with a three-month curfew. Rosser was also ordered to attend a sex offenders' rehabilitation course and his computer was confiscated. Laura Pitman, prosecuting, said: 'A search warrant was executed by police officers at the defendant's home address. Seized were a number of items, including his computer. 'That computer was examined and images of extreme pornography, involving adults and animals was discovered. 'He was subsequently interviewed and admitted he knew these images were on his computer.

He said the last time was about a year before they had executed the search warrant. That would be in 2009. 'When the police examined his computer they found 12 live movie clips that he could still watch.' Stephen Grattage, defending, said: 'He was a PCSO for several years and was well regarded. 'He did a good job and always tried to keep himself within the law. He didn't realise that this was a criminal offence. 'He was very upset that he had crossed that line. It was an error on his part. 'When this man was charged, he was so shaken that he was actually held in custody for a short while for his own safety. 'All of the films that depicted extreme pornography were found in areas consistent with being stored automatically by the internet browser. 'Mr Rosser was surprised when he heard the number. He had viewed something like 60 video clips.' Detective Chief Inspector Dave Evison of the Lincolnshire Police professional standards department said the investigation it should serve as a 'warning' to other officers. He said: 'It is always disappointing when a member of staff breaks the law or falls below the high standards of conduct that the force demands of all our employees. 'The investigation into Mr Rosser should serve as a warning to other persons within our organisation that we will investigate and prosecute offenders like him. 'Hopefully this robust policy will offer some reassurance to the public that the force fully intends to seek out wrong doers and to rightly uphold the high standards expected of us.'","Alan Rosser watched 60 videos, downloaded 12 movie clips and looked at almost 5,000 images .

A nurse stabbed her four-year-old daughter to death and tried to kill herself by drinking bleach after she faced the sack for leaking patient details to an accident 'cash for claims' law firm. Dawn Makin, 33, who is now permanently wheelchair bound following her attempted suicide, had been unmasked as a health centre 'mole' after she secretly fed confidential data to her boyfriend who was trying to sign up patients for a personal injury litigation company. But as health bosses investigated the scandal, Makin who faced losing her job, stabbed Chloe Burke to death and then cut her wrists and drank toxic fluid, believed to be bleach, in a bid to kill herself. Today, at Preston Crown Court, she wept as she pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished . responsibility after her 'not guilty to murder' plea was accepted by the . prosecution. In court: Wheel-chair bound Dawn Makin arrives at Preston Crown Court for the hearing today. She is pictured right in a Facebook picture with her four-year-old daughter Chloe who she stabbed to death . She was found unconscious next to . Chloe's body at their family home in Fairfield, Bury, Greater Manchester . when a worried relative alerted a neighbour. Makin . was rushed to hospital in a critical condition and later regained . partial consciousness but for several months was deemed to be too ill to . be interviewed by police. She . was charged with murder ten months later but is now confined to a . wheelchair and is living under 24 hour care in a hospital rehabilitation unit. Tests revealed Chloe died from multiple stab wounds. She will be sentenced next month following the preparation of two reports from forensic psychiatrists and was remanded on bail. Guilty: Dawn Makin, left, was charged with murder 10 months after Chloe, right, was found dead. She now lives under 24 hour care in a rehabilitation unit and cried as she appeared in court pleading guilty to manslaughter . Lawyers are expected to read out personal statements from Chloe’s family and submit graphic photos of the death scene and the little girl's injuries at the next hearing. Chloe’s father Michael Burke was not in court. The tragedy occurred after Makin was warned she she faced facing disciplinary action and the sack for illegally accessing a computer at the Moorgate Primary Care walk-in centre where she worked in Bury. She had earlier been placed under investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office for leaking patient details to boyfriend Martin Campbell who worked at the time as an agent for personal injuries claim firm Direct Assist. Crime scene: Forensic officers at the home where Chloe's body was found. Ms Makin cut her wrists and drank toxic fluids. She was found unconscious next to her daughter when a worried relative alerted a neighbour . Campbell, 34, obtained names and telephones of 29 accident victims who had been treated at the walk in centre then called them himself in an attempted to sign them up and increase his pay check over a four-month period from December 2009. He was caught when patients started to complain to NHS Bury, saying that a man had called them about their injuries and encouraged them to make a personal injury claim. NHS Bury then investigated and found the files had been accessed without legitimate reason by Makin. Chloe’s body was discovered in February last year after her grandmother, Sheila Makin, raised the alarm following failed attempts to contact her. A neighbour broke down the door and made the discovery. In court Makin wore a black short sleeved top with silver sequins, a green army style jacket with hood, white leggings, grey sandals, pink handbag. She spoke to confirm her name and to plead guilty to the charge. Investigation: A review of Chloe's death is due to be carried out by child protection experts in Bury . Prosecutor Mr Peter Wright QC said: . 'This is a case in which both experts express opinions but they agree . that this is a case where the defendant at the time was suffering from a . medical condition. 'It was a . medical condition that subsequently impaired her ability to do one or . more things mentioned in the act. Both were satisfied it provides an . explanation for the defendant’s actions. 'The . family of Chloe, the grandparents and natural father and those . interested parties have all been informed that this was the view taken . after careful consideration and understand the reasoning behind the . acceptance of the plea.' Adjourning . the case Judge Anthony Russell QC replied: 'I’m sure they do understand . the position is a very difficult one for everyone.' Makin . did not attend Chloe’s funeral at St Joseph’s Roman Catholic Church in . Bury the following April in an hour long service which heard the . youngster described as a 'little princess.' Police outside Ms Makin's home. She had been unmasked as a health centre . 'mole' after she secretly fed confidential data to her boyfriend who was . trying to sign up patients for a personal injury litigation company . Campbell, of Bury, was fined £1,050 plus £1,175 costs in June last year after he admitted seven counts of breaching the Data Protection Act and asked for 22 other offences to be considered. At the time Information Commissioner Christopher Graham said: 'People’s medical information is some of their most sensitive data and they rightly expect health workers only to access it when there is a legitimate business need. 'Abusing this trust for personal gain is clearly wrong and potentially very distressing for those affected. 'Martin Campbell would have known that obtaining the information was unlawful and yet he put his greed ahead of people’s privacy rights. 'Where greed and breach of trust meet then the results, as in this case, can be tragic.'

Smashed: The property is held up by scaffolding and the brick wall show the impact of the lorry . A recluse weighing 35-stone was forced to abandon his home yesterday after a council lorry smashed into it - leaving his house for the first time in years. Mark Dawson, was named by his neighbours who said they have never seen leaving his home with the only activity outside the cottage being supermarket and takeaway deliveries to his door. Mr Dawson was forced to abandon his cottage in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire, on Tuesday after a council cleaning truck reversed into it smashing the front window and door. Firefighters were called to secure the scene at 12.30pm and brought Mr Dawson out through the back. Friends said they believed Mark, who neighbours estimate weighs 35-stone had either been rehoused, or was staying with relatives. One neighbour, who lives three doors from the damaged house, said: ‘I have never seen him. I have lived here for three years and I have never seen him leave. ‘He even has his shopping delivered from supermarkets so he didn’t have to go anywhere. ‘He would probably never have left if it wasn’t for the council lorry.’ Another neighbour, who witnessed the incident, said: ‘The truck was parked up across the street, the driver had got out to go to the toilet and forgotten to put the hand break on. ‘Next thing you know, the bin lorry starts rolling towards our row. I heard a loud thud and came out to have a look at the damage.' The neighbour said that Mr Dawson rarely leaved the house and was now likely to be staying with family until his house was safe. Another eye witnesses said Mr Dawson seemed very distressed about leaving his home. Recluse: Mr Dawson is said to rarely leave home and has all food delivered to the door. It may therefore be the first time in years he has been outside his Hertfordshire property . An ambulance was called to collect the stunned resident and the property was boarded up earlier today with scaffolding appearing to hold up the front wall. The East Hertfordshire District Council vehicle rolled from the cemetery across a roundabout into the terraced cottage in Bishop’s Stortford, on Tuesday morning. The driver, who had pulled up to use the public toilets at the cemetery, told police the handbrake had failed. Mr Dawson, who was unhurt, was reassured by an officer while police climbed over the back garden wall using a ladder to access the property. Fire and rescue crews cordoned off the area and used props and boards to stabilise the front of the cottage and the neighbouring property in preparation for the truck to be recovered. A structural engineer arrived on the scene at about midday to assess the damage’ Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service Incident commander Dean Risley said: ‘The porch is only staying up because it’s sitting on the roof of the vehicle. ‘The chances are it will probably come down but we’re hoping it might not. ‘It will have to come down eventually anyway because it’s unsafe.’ East Herts District Council confirmed today that they are investigating the situation.","Mark Dawson has been named by neighbours who have not seen him leave the property for years .

The Oscar-winning actor's big donation to Priorities USA Action, the 'super' political action committee backing the president, was announced on Thursday and will be reported in the group's federal disclosures on Friday. Freeman's donation came after controversial remarks about Obama's heritage the actor made to NPR earlier this month, where he said the U.S. is still yet to have its first black president. Hey, big spender: Morgan Freeman has become the latest Hollywood A-lister to drop a cool million to a pro-Obama super PAC . All smiles: Obama raises his arms with Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz of Florida during a campaign rally in West Palm Beach, Florida . Freeman said during the July 5 interview: 'First thing that pops into my head regarding our president is that all of the people who are setting up this barrier...they just conveniently forget that Barack had a mama, and she was white - very white American, Kansas, middle of America.' 'There was no argument about who he is or what he is. America's first Black president hasn't arisen yet. 'He is not America's first Black president - he's America's first mixed-race president.' The context of Freeman's comments . were meant as a wider criticism of Donald Trump and his fellow birthers . and were meant to attack Republicans and the presidents opponents. Freeman told NPR: 'He is being purposely, purposely thwarted by the Republican Party who . started out at the beginning of his tenure saying, ""We are going to do . whatever is necessary to make sure that he's only going to serve one . term."" Greeting the fans: Freeman waves to supporters as he leaves the Dorchester Hotel in London, where he is promoting The Dark Knight Rises . Barack Obama with his father, Barack Obama Sr, . at Honolulu airport during their first and only meeting (left) while he . sits with his mother Ann Dunham and half-sister Maya (right) in . Indonesia . 'That means they will not cooperate with him on anything. So to say he's ineffective is a misappropriation of the facts.' For Obama, whose mother Ann Dunham, a . white woman from Kansas, married his father, the Kenyan native Barack . Obama Sr., the question of his racial identity has been a lifelong . struggle. Before he was . president, Obama was a community activist in Chicago and always . self-identified as African-American, and wears the mantle of America's . first black president with pride. Despite identifying himself as . African American, Obama's struggles with his identity are well . known and his memoir Dreams From My Father followed his journey to discover his Kenyan roots . and how he came to feel more of a black man than a white man. Re-election hopeful: Obama speaks during a campaign event on Thursday at West Palm Beach Century Village in West Palm Beach, Florida . During the 2010 U.S. Census, the president did not check multiple boxes . on his form, or even elaborate on his racial heritage. He ticked the box that said, 'Black, African Am., or Negro'. Priorities USA has raised $20.4million this election cycle but lags far behind Restore Our Future, the Super PAC supporting Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Restore Our Future has so far reported raising $81.5million. Super PACs are allowed to raise and spend unlimited funds. Operating outside of official efforts of campaigns and national parties, they have taken over much of the dirty work of negative ads. Campaigner: Priorities USA has raised $20.4million this election cycle but lags far behind Restore Our Future, the Super PAC supporting Mitt Romney, pictured today at an event in Roxbury, Massachusetts . With four months to go before the . November 6 general election, each side is on track to spend more than $1billion on campaigning and ads. Last . month both Super PACs had their best month of fundraising yet. Priorities raised $6.1million and Restore pulled in $20million. Overall, Obama's official campaign has raised more money than what Romney has raked in for his campaign. But the Republican has made inroads with Wall Street and the business community, which have grown disenchanted with Obama's policies. The fantastic Mr Fox: Freeman is pictured attending the world premiere of The Dark Knight Rises, in which he reprises his role as Bruce Wayne mentor Lucius Fox . Hollywood and the entertainment industry remain among the biggest groups supporting Obama. 'President Obama has done a remarkable job in historically difficult circumstances,' Freeman, 75, said in a statement. The . statement went on: 'In return, he is the target of hundreds of millions . of dollars from right-wing sources. I am proud to lend my voice - and . support - to those who defend him.' While Obama is under fire for the flagging U.S. economy and stubbornly high joblessness, Priorities USA has spent much of its cash on ads skewering Romney for his role at private equity firm Bain Capital. Morgan Freeman played an African American president in the 1998 blockbuster movie 'Deep Impact' One of the first Hollywood celebrities to give to Priorities USA was comedian Bill Maher, whose $1 million contribution in February became controversial because of his politically charged jokes and comments. Priorities has also received $2million from Hollywood producer and DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, and $100,000 each from film director Steven Spielberg and comedian Chelsea Handler. Freeman is in the Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises, opening in theaters on Friday. It is his third appearance as Bruce Wayne's mentor Lucius Fox.

A record-breaking woman who has trekked on horseback from the Beijing Olympics to the 2012 Games in London is on the home straight - after a staggering four year journey. Megan Lewis, a 63-year-old mother of three, has let nothing distract her from reaching the finish line - coping with broken ribs and a punctured lung, sleeping inches from scorpions, and even the breakdown of her marriage during the gruelling trek. Megan said her separation from her husband was a 'desperately sad time', and admitted that falling from her horse and breaking her ribs just ten days into her epic trek 'wasn't the best of starts', but she added: 'Apart from that it has all been pretty easy'. Olympic effort: It has taken Megan Lewis, pictured at the Great Wall of China, four years to complete her journey from Beijing to London on horseback . Rough terrain: Megan faced snowy conditions as she trekked across the Gobi desert in China . Breathtaking: Kazakhstan's Akyrtas Ruins are among the many incredible sights Megan has taken in on her epic four year journey . The former geography teacher, from Pumpsaint in Carmarthenshire, Wales, started in October 2008 on the outskirts of Beijing - host to the last Olympic Games - and is now galloping through Surrey towards the London venue. She has used seven horses and travelled nine countries on the trek - dubbed the Long Horse Ride - which took her along the Great Wall of China, through the Gobi desert, across the desert flats of Kazakhstan and on through mainland Europe. The 63-year-old has spent between six and eight hours each day in the saddle over the past four years, as she trekked through China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Austria, Germany, France, and finally the UK. Crossing Europe: Megan and her ride are pictured gazing out to sea on Dieppe beach, Germany . Trip of a lifetime: The intrepid former geography teacher is pictured outside a ranch in Austria . Are we there yet? Megan and one of her seven faithful horses are pictured on the bank of the River Rhine in France . It hasn't been an entirely smooth ride for Megan and her faithful steeds; the former teacher was hospitalised when she fell off her horse just ten days into her journey. 'I fell off 10 days after leaving Beijing and broke six ribs and punctured a lung,' she said. 'The horse got spooked and shot forwards. I wasn't paying attention and fell off the back landing on my head. 'I ended up having to go to hospital and it set me back three months.' Megan and her back-up team also spent three weeks stuck on the border of Ukraine and Hungary because of a problem with her EU paperwork. 'We were in no-man's land waiting for all the correct documents. It was all very frustrating,' she said. Megan's marriage also suffered as a result of the huge undertaking, and she and her husband have split up since she set off from Beijing four years ago. 'My husband was very supportive, especially as I'm raising money for his charity,' she said. 'But . during the journey our relationship deteriorated. The stress of it all . and the distance took their toll and we ended up separating. 'It was a desperately sad time, but I persevered.' Megan Lewis has had to make do with limited cooking and washing facilities while living primarily in her horse box over the past four years . Wild ride: Megan Lewis has travelled through nine countries to make her way from Beijing to London on horseback . In fact the 63-year-old remained undeterred by any of the challenges she faced during the 8,000 mile trek. 'If you can cross China then the rest becomes child's play in comparison,' she said. Megan spent many nights sleeping camped out under the stars or in the back of her horse trailer - often going weeks without a shower. 'It hasn't been comfortable,' said Megan, speaking while en route. 'I . used to wash in a small plastic bowl, but because of the scarcity of . water we would go weeks without a wash - it would get to the point where . a wash was a treat.' Throughout the journey Megan has ridden seven horses - named Baiju, Shan Dan, Little Bolasak, Big Bolasak and three named Zorbee. Well earned rest: Megan slept in her horse box for much of the Europe leg of the trip, before which she and her team stayed in small hotels, houses, truck stops, or simply camped out under the stars . She used local guides to help her . navigate tricky terrain and negotiate strict border controls as she passed . through various countries. Megan said the hospitality shown to her and her team by locals across Asia and Europe was one of the highlights of her adventure. 'Being invited into people's homes and having banquets laid on for us has been touching,' she said. 'I've even had locals run up to us and hand over gifts - anything from apples to onions.' 'My children think I am completely mad, but are not surprised,' said lifelong horse-rider Megan, who added that a lengthy trek had always been an ambition. 'I think I've had a leaning towards Asia because I was brought up in the Far East,' she said. 'And then with the Olympics being handed over from Beijing to London, and my children having all flown the nest - it was all perfect timing.'","Determined Megan Lewis, 63, endured broken ribs, spent three weeks stranded in Hungary, and even split from her husband as she battled to achieve her goal .

The couple began dating last year and became engaged in December after working together at the  Petit Family Foundation, a charity Dr. Petit set up . in memory of his family. New-found happiness: Dr William Petit, the lone survivor of a brutal home invasion in Connecticut, has married photographer Christine Paluf. His wife and two daughters died in the attack in 2007 . Dr Petit, a diabetes specialist, gave up practicing medicine after the death of his wife and children and decided to devote his life to fighting . for justice for them through the foundation. In 2008, he met Paluf at a local . country club, where she worked as a marketing director, and she offered . her professional photography services to the charity. 'It was fun,' Hayley Hovhanessian from the Petit Foundation told ABC News after the wedding, adding that the couple had planned on a honeymoon but she is 'not sure where'. Marybelle Hawke, the mother of Dr Petit's deceased wife Jennifer Hawke-Petit, said her family welcomed the engagement and encouraged Petit to find peace and joy in his life.

They are on death row for the . murders of Mrs Hawke-Petit, 48, and the couple's daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old . Michaela.

Dr Petit was beaten with a baseball bat and tied up in the basement, but managed to escape by crawling to a neighbour's house. Paluf attended the trials for the killers of Petit's family. Both Komisarjevsky and Hayes were convicted and are currently on Connecticut's death row, waiting to be put to death by lethal injection. 'There is never complete closure when . you lose your wife and family, but the first part is over and we think . justice has been served,' Petit said last December. He also spoke of his devastation and how he had contemplated suicide after he was left with a 'jagged hole in my heart'. 'I miss my entire family, my home, . everything we had together,' he said.

For software developer James Kosta, life has played virtually like a video game, with a new character on every level. From parental divorcee to computer hacker, convicted criminal to Navy intelligence analyst, CIA agent to multimillionaire - the 37-year-old knows how to role-play. At 13 he was already earning $1,500 a month as an IT consultant. He even managed to persuade his school to let him 'formalise the computer club' and run his business from there. With an 18-year-old girlfriend, . pockets full of cash and friends aplenty he began skipping school and . staying out late into the night. Then his parents issued him with an ultimatum: If he wanted to live under their roof he had to give it all up and focus on school. 'I went to court and proved to a judge I was responsible enough to be on my own,' he told the Huffington Post. Alone and with nobody to reign him in, he turned his knack for computers into low-level hacking. But . his solo activities soon caught the attentions of the online criminal . underworld and he was swiftly recruited into a criminal hacking collective. He and his accomplices began hacking the sites of big business and military, including the systems of major banks, General Electric and IBM. For this 14-year-old nothing was out of bounds. Then . early one morning there was a bang on the door. Naked and bleary eyed, . Kosta answered and was bundled to the ground by an FBI tactical squad armed . with MP-5 sub-machine guns. 'I . was terrified. When you're that young, because your parents always give . you warnings, you expect someone to say, hey, knock it off. I never . expected any action like that.' And because he was now divorced from his parents, he was officially a 14-year-old adult. Off the rails: Kosta soon earned a reputation in the online criminal underworld and was recruited into a feared hacking collective infiltrating the sites of big business and military (stock image) He . was found guilty of 45 counts of technical burglary and sentenced to 45 years in jail. But he says the judge saw a spark inside the troubled and neglected child and decided to give him a chance of atonement. After a year in juvenile detention, he was released on a suspended sentence and offered a spot in the military on the condition that he would not commit another crime. 'For me, it was a no-brainer,' he says. 'I knew if I went to maximum security for youth, a guy like me probably wouldn't have a good experience.' Langley, Virginia, CIA HQ: By the age of 20, Kosta was working for the CIA tracking money wired between warlords and radical sheiks in North Africa and the Middle East . As soon as he was eligible, he joined the Navy and was swiftly stationed in the intelligence division, responsible for tracking money wired between warlords and radical sheiks in North Africa and the Middle East. From there he was drafted into 'penetration testing on military installations', in some of the first stages of technological warfare. However, by the late 1990s, it began to dawn on Kosta that he wanted to make more of his life than propping up the establishment and  started one of the first commercial websites focused on financial markets with his brother. In 1999 they sold it for tens of millions of dollars. Passion for games: After 9/11 he designed a computer simulation for the CIA to imitate 'Las Vegas getting hit with a dirty bomb' using a game engine by the company that developed Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon (pictured) But the draw of the Government dollar pulled him back after 9/11 and he designed a military computer simulation to imitate 'Las Vegas getting hit with a dirty bomb and how rescuers could lock down the city' He had such fun with the simulation game, based on a game engine by the company that developed Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon, that he decided to focus all his powers on making virtual worlds. He says the draw of interactive entertainment is 'allowing people to create their own worlds [...] like watching ants from above'. Now Kosta runs game development firm  3G Studios Inc, a company that turns over more than $10 million a year. 'I was an intelligent, rebellious youth, but my grades and attendance . records weren't the sole indicators for my potential contribution to . society,' he says. 'Ultimately, society suffers when we're that myopic [but] when you . look a little deeper, as people did with me, you're able to get kids . focused on their potential.' His company also works closely with 'troubled youth', mentoring teens to help them find their way to engage because 'that's something I owe to the people who helped me.'","James Kosta came off the rails and divorced his parents at 13 .

Guilty: The man admitted cruel attacks on his wife, two daughters and son between 1999 and 2011 (file picture) A father who hung his daughter upside . down from a chandelier and subjected his children to a series of cruel . punishments for trivial matters, has been jailed for five years. The 44-year-old man, from Halliwell, . Bolton, Greater Manchester, admitted inflicting a catalogue of cruel . attacks on his wife, two daughters and son between 1999 and 2011, to . punish them for things as trivial as spilling salt. Bolton Crown Court heard how the man locked his son in a dark outhouse after he saw him playing with a toy car, and dislocated his two-year-old daughter's arm by 'roughly' dumping her in a cot. Jailing him for five years and three months yesterday at Manchester Crown Court, judge Maureen Roddy, said: 'Conduct in some of the charges, . had it been used in war time interrogation, it would have been subject . to real criticism - and I remind you that this is treatment of real . children in a family home.' The court heard how the man, who can't be named to protect the identity of his children, even tied up his two daughters and covered their head with a sheet . when neither owned up to spilling salt. When the children's mother tried to . intervene, he ripped her nightdress off, leaving her naked in front of . her children, before beating her. On another occasion one of the girls . was chastised by being draped upside down from a chandelier by her feet . and her bare bottom hit with the cling film. The court heard that cling film became the defendant's weapon of choice. A further cruelty charge related to . him biting one of his daughter's arms. He then hit her with a roll of . cellophane wrap. When people noticed the bite marks he blamed it on . another child. Manchester Crown Court judge Maureen Roddy said some of the charges would have been harsh if used in wartime interrogation. He sentenced him to five years . The man's . seven-year-old son also wet himself because he was so scared when his . father 'flew into a rage' after seeing him playing with a toy car. He . was locked in a dark outhouse before being dragged back into the house . and stripped naked. Ten years ago the man also attacked his wife with a rolling pin while she was pregnant. The man hung his daughter upside down from a chandelier (file pictured) by her feet and hit on her bare bottom . She had a miscarriage the following day, but there is no medical evidence to suggest it was caused by his actions. The man was also charged with actual bodily harm charge following an attack on his wife in front of her children in which she suffered a black eye. Farrhat Arshad, defending, said the man believed he was disciplining his children in an act of love. Judge Roddy said the defendant's attacks against his wife showed the children how she was powerless against his brutality and unable to protect the children from him. She said: 'I accept it wasn't without happy times but it was a life lived in the shadow of these dramatic incidents of cruelty.' She said the defendant will feel a term of imprisonment more acutely as he is unable to speak English. He pleaded guilty to eight counts of . child cruelty, assault on a woman, assault on a 16-year-old girl and . causing a woman actually bodily harm. He was jailed for 63 months for the child cruelty charges, 18 months for actual bodily harm and 81 days for common assault. All sentences will run concurrently.","The 44-year-old man locked his son in a dark outhouse after seeing him playing with a toy car .

A Tennessee Titans football player has died aged just 25 after shooting himself while sitting in his car. Wide receiver O.J. Murdock is the sixth NFL star to commit suicide in the last two years, a chilling trend which has sparked debate over the potential damage playing football can inflict on the brain. The player was found in his car outside his old high school in Tampa, Florida around 8.30 on Monday morning, in critical condition after suffering a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Doctors at Tampa General Hospital were unable to save him and he died just over two hours later. Murdock had his whole life ahead of him, and faced the prospect of becoming a multi-millionaire through pursuing a sporting career. Promising: The 25-year-old signed with the Titans a year ago but tragically never played a game for the team. Here his is pictured during a game for Fort Hays State . At around 3.30am Murdock had sent a cryptic message to his Fort Hays State receivers coach Al McCray. 'It was like, ""Coach, I appreciate everything you've done for me and my family,""' he told the Tampa Bay Times. 'At the end of the text he said, ""I apologise."" I figured he's apologising because he texted me so early.' Mr McCray said he had spoken to the 25-year-old just days before his death and that he had seemed in good spirits, excited about going to see his mother. 'The people in Hays [Kansas], gosh, they love him so much,' he added. 'If he wanted to run for mayor, he would've won in a landslide.' The coach continued: 'Our homecoming game his senior year, the fire marshal calls our athletic director to say: ""Listen, we can't allow any more people to come into this game, we're at capacity."" Our A.D. was like, ""No, you're not. Let em in."" That's just the impact that kid had here. 'It's hard, it really is because he was such a good kid. He was lazy in the classroom in high school, and of course he messed up at South Carolina, but you're talking about a kid who was on his mom's couch for two years. 'He got the grades he needed and he came up here and he had one dream, one goal: ""I'm going to come out here and I'm going to play at a high level and I'll get to the National Football League."" And the kid did it. He did it.' Tragic: O.J. Murdock shot himself on Monday morning as he sat in his car . The 25-year-old star, who was single at the time of his death, signed with the Titans a year ago but tragically never played a game for the team. As a senior at Middleton High School in 2005, Murdock was rated the 10th-best wide receiver recruit in the nation by Rivals.com. He signed with South Carolina, but . played in only four games, making one catch, after redshirting his first . season. He was arrested for shoplifting at a Florida department store . during that 2006 season and suspended. Murdock transferred to Pearl River . Community College in Mississippi and then to Division II Fort Hays State . in Kansas. As a senior in 2010, he had 60 catches for 1,290 yards and . 12 touchdowns. That earned him an invitation to the . NFL scouting combine. After going undrafted, he was signed by the Titans . last summer but spent the entire 2011 season on injured reserve after . hurting his right Achilles early in training camp. In May 2012 Junior Seau (left) of the San Diego Chargers, died of a gunshot wound to the chest. Dave Duerson (right) shot himself in February 2011 . The standout high school player . missed Titans practice twice over the weekend for 'personal reasons', but . the club said they were stunned by his suicide. In . a statement they said: 'We are shocked and saddened to hear of . O.J. Murdock’s death this morning,' the Titans said in a statement. 'In . his brief time here, a number of our players, coaches and staff had . grown close to O.J., and this is a difficult time for them. 'He spent the last year battling back . from an Achilles injury as he prepared for this year’s training camp. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends as they try to . cope with this tragedy.' Titans general manager Ruston Weber . said: 'We were concerned initially when O.J. didn't report on the 27th. But we were able to make contact with him and he assured us everything . was OK and he would be in here on Sunday. He didn't make it on Sunday.' Wade Belak hanged himself in August 2011. In April Ray Easterling, a one-time Atlanta Falcons star, shot himself at home after struggling to cope with dementia . Murdock becomes the sixth former NFL star to kill himself in the past two years. The NFL has found itself at the . centre of several lawsuits, with the families of players who have killed . themselves claiming football-related brain injuries led to their . deaths. Three former NFL . players - Junior Seau, Ray Easterling and Dave Duerson - died of . self-inflicted gunshot wounds in the past year and a half. Wade . Belak hanged himself in August, although that is not believed to have . been driven by brain damage. Murdock's name has not come up in the . ongoing concussion debate and it is not yet known what drove him to suicide. Easterling . and Duerson were found to have brain damage at the time of their deaths . and their families are among those suing the league over the long-term . effects of concussions. Brain tissue from Seau has been released by his . family for study. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is . associated with cognitive and behavioural problems later in life and can . eventually cause dementia. Also known as punch drunk syndrome, it has been most common in boxers and is associated with receiving multiple concussions. In . recent years, CTE has been shown to exist in other athletes, including . professional and college football players and pro hockey players. Sufferers . can show symptoms such as memory loss, aggression, confusion and . depression which may appear within months of the trauma or many decades . later. Dave Duerson: Two-time Super Bowl winner Dave Duerson shot himself in February 2011 after texting family members asking for his brain to be examined for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative disease.

NBA superstar LeBron James is no stranger to blocking shots, but he’s the one who got rejected when a top U.S. swimmer shut him down. First time Olympian Lauren Perdue, 21, said she was approached by the basketball star on July 26 when the team came to the Olympic Village to meet the U.S. swimmers, who are tearing it up in London. Perdue and James must have hit it off, because she said that the Miami Heat forward then asked her to have dinner with him. Meet and greet: Lauren Perdue posted this Instagram photo on her Twitter page shortly after meeting LeBron James . She took to Twitter to express her excitement, saying: 'Lebron James just invited me to dinner... Um wuuuutttt?!?' She also posted a photo of herself with James on Instagram. However, it was later revealed that the swimming stunner turned down King James, saying she had to abide by the Olympic Village curfew. Perhaps it was for the best, as the curfew-abiding swim champ won a gold medal in the 4x200m freestyle relay final just days later. Superstars: James is cruising toward a gold medal with Team USA basketball, while Perdue won her first Olympic gold on Wednesday . She later deleted the tweet, but not before it was re-tweeted by the University of Virginia, where Perdue is a senior. In an interview with Charlotte Observer columnist Scott Fower, Perdue spilled the details of the encounter. She said: 'He was kind of joking but he was basically like, 'Would you like to come eat with me at the dining hall?' 'And I said, 'Um, I'm sorry, I have a curfew. So I turned that one down, yeah.'

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 20:08 EST, 4 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:06 EST, 5 August 2012 . The men came from different walks of life on two continents: a children's puppeteer in Florida, a hotel manager in Massachusetts, an emergency medical technician in Kansas, a day care worker in the Netherlands. In all, 43 men have been arrested over the past two years in a horrific, far-flung child porn network that unravelled like a sweater with a single loose thread. In this case, the thread was a stuffed toy bunny. Tracing back: Robert Mikelsons, a 27-year-old day care worker in Amsterdam was found having abused a woman's 18-month-old boy photographed holding a toy rabbit . The bunny, seen in a photo of a half-naked, distraught 18-month-old boy, was used to painstakingly trace a molester to Amsterdam. From there, investigators made one arrest after another of men accused of sexually abusing children, exchanging explicit photos of the attacks and even chatting online about abducting, cooking and eating youngsters. Authorities have identified more than 140 young victims so far and say there is no end in sight as they pore through hundreds of thousands of images found on the suspects' computers. They are also trying to determine whether the men who talked about murder and cannibalism actually committed such acts or were just sharing twisted fantasies. The still-widening investigation has been code-named Holitna, after a river in Alaska with many tributaries. 'They are the worst of the worst,' said Bruce Foucart, agent in charge of the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement agency's Homeland Security Investigations unit in Boston. 'This isn't just a child that's nude and someone's taking pictures of him; this is a child that's being raped by an adult, which is horrific.' Sharing: Robert Diduca, a Massachusetts father and Sheraton hotel manager, pleaded guilty to child porn and sexual exploitation after sending the photo of the boy with the rabbit to an undercover agent . The case began to unfold when Robert Diduca, a Sheraton hotel manager from Milford, Mass., sent the photo of the Dutch boy to an undercover federal agent in Boston. Diduca, a married father of three who used the screen name 'Babytodd,' thought he was sending the picture to another man with a sexual interest in babies and toddlers. Agents forwarded the photo to Interpol, the international police organization, and to several other countries. An . investigator for the Dutch police recognized the stuffed bunny as . Miffy, a familiar character in a series of Dutch children's books. She . also traced the boy's orange sweater to a small Amsterdam store that had . sold only 20 others like it. The boy's photo was broadcast on a . national TV program similar to 'America's Most Wanted.' Within minutes, . friends and relatives called the child's mother. Shared: A pornographic photo of the boy holding a stuffed Dutch rabbit named Miffy, a similar one shown here, led police to 140 more young victims abused with the boy's photo passed around . Robert Mikelsons, a 27-year-old day care worker who baby-sat the boy, was arrested. On his computer were thousands and thousands of images of children being molested and raped, including the boy holding the stuffed bunny. Photos and online chats found on computers owned by Diduca and Mikelsons led to more than three dozen other suspects in seven countries, including Canada, Britain, Germany, Sweden and Mexico. The oldest victim in the Netherlands was 4, the youngest just 19 days old. Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, whose office prosecuted Diduca, said the demand for photos of sexual assaults of young children, including babies and toddlers, has increased sharply in recent years. 'This demand leads to the abuse of children, yet there is this misconception that somehow, viewing child pornography is a victimless crime,' said. 'It clearly is not.' Diduca pleaded guilty to child porn and sexual exploitation charges and was sentenced to 18 years in prison. His lawyer, Richard Sweeney, said Diduca was sexually abused as a child by a Boy Scout leader. 'He gets it, he knows he needs to be punished, he knows what he did is wrong,' Sweeney said. Mikelsons also received an 18-year sentence, followed by indefinite psychiatric commitment, after confessing to sexually abusing more than 80 children. The horror did not let up after the Mikelsons case. In May, authorities arrested Michael Arnett of Roeland Park, Kan., after finding pornographic photos he allegedly produced. Agents discovered the pictures when they searched the computer of a Wisconsin man who had been chatting online with Mikelsons. What they found on Arnett's computer was unlike anything some of the investigators had ever come across: long, graphic, online chats about his desire to abduct, kill and eat children. They said he had also made photos of a naked 2-year-old boy in a roasting pan inside his oven. The child and two other boys Arnett allegedly abused and photographed were later identified and found alive. Production: In May, authorities arrested Michael Arnett of Kansas after finding pornographic photos he allegedly produced and shared with, among many, a man named Ronald Brown in Florida . In July, authorities arrested four men . they say had online discussions with Arnett about kidnapping and eating . children. Those arrested included Ronald Brown, a children's puppeteer . from Largo, Fla. (A YouTube video shows Brown during an appearance on a . Christian TV kids show in the 1980s. In the video, he tells a child . puppet that he did the right thing by refusing to look at 'dirty . pictures' some other youngsters tried to show him.) In excerpts of an online chat between Arnett and Brown from 2011, the two men appear to be discussing their desire to cook a child for Easter. 'he would make a fine Easter feast,' Arnett says. 'yes, his thighs and butt cheeks would be fantastic for Easter,' Brown responds. A lawyer for Arnett would not comment on the allegations. Brown's lawyer did not return calls. Prosecutors said Brown acknowledged his online conversations but said that it was all a fantasy and that he would never hurt anyone. Scare: Ronald Brown, a children's puppeteer in Florida, was arrested after his connection and discussions with Arnett about kidnapping and eating children . 'Obviously the discussions regarding their claims of cannibalism are disturbing and a concern to our agency,' said ICE spokesman Ross Feinstein. He said agents are following all leads 'to make sure these individuals didn't follow through on any of their claims.' To find the young victims, investigators carefully studied thousands of photos, read hours of Internet chats and worked with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. They also employed some forensic wizardry. After finding a video on Diduca's computer of a bound, 2-year-old boy being raped, investigators enhanced the images of furniture and carpet and determined the attack took place in a motel room in Bakersfield, Calif. Then they pinpointed the date by way . of a TV that was playing in the background in the video, figuring out . exactly when a particular episode of 'Family Matters' aired along with a . certain Pepperidge Farms commercial. A man from Black Forest, Colo., was arrested and is awaiting trial. Similarly, . in the Arnett case, investigators discovered that a water bottle in one . of the photographs carried the name of a swim and scuba center in . Overland Park, Kan. With the help of teachers at an elementary school, . they identified three children shown in the photographs, including the . toddler posed in the roasting pan. The . mother of one of the boys said she initially did not believe the . allegations against Arnett, a family friend for about 15 years. She said . her son, now 7, and several nephews often spent weekends at Arnett's . home four or five years ago. 'Well, when we first got the phone call, we thought there's no way. You guys got the wrong guy,' she said. The Associated Press does not identify victims of sexual abuse or their families. But then investigators showed her photos Arnett had allegedly taken of her son with a shirt and no pants. 'Regret? For sending my son with a sick-minded guy, that's the only regret I have. I had no idea,' she said. 'It's depressing.' For the agents working on the case, the leads never seem to end. Last week, they arrested another Massachusetts man after finding child pornography and photos of what appeared to be dead children on his computer. He allegedly had online chats with Arnett and Brown. More arrests are expected. 'The agents that work for me are extremely driven on this type of investigation,' said Bart Cahill, assistant agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Boston. 'They really believe that they are taking out horrific violators and saving kids.'","43 men have been arrested in connection to a circulating pornographic photo containing a Dutch toy bunny .

Leaving court: Dr Lucy Dawson got sick pay from one hospital, while working as a locum in others . A doctor accused of cheating the NHS out of £30,000 while on sick leave was caught out after boasting on Twitter that she was  earning ‘megabucks’, a court heard yesterday. Although Dr Lucy Dawson was  signed off work with stress and depression for six months, she was also  allegedly moonlighting as an £800-a-day hospital locum. The 45-year-old’s fraud trial heard that she was reported by Nick Jenkins – her former lover and boss, with whom she  had a 13-year affair – after their relationship ended ‘acrimoniously’. His wife had spotted Dawson’s Twitter messages boasting that she was earning  ‘a stupid amount of dosh’. The mother of two also bragged on the social messaging site about drinking  wine and a lifestyle of ‘nightshift Monday, debauchery Tuesday’, while still signed  off from her main job in the Royal Gwent Hospital’s casualty ward, Newport Crown Court was told. Dawson is accused of claiming £29,320 in sick pay while earning £7,840 working in secret as a  stand-in doctor with neighbouring health authorities. Her NHS employers were also forced to pay another £36,000 to locums who stood in for her in her main job as an accident and emergency specialist. Dawson first went on sick leave in October 2009, claiming she had a ‘very bad head’. But Newport Crown Court heard the prosecution claim she worked an eight-hour shift at Worcestershire Royal Hospital, earning £520. Dawson then returned to work but went on sick leave just a month later, telling bosses she was stressed and suffering from depression. It is claimed that she then worked another nine shifts at the Worcestershire hospital and at Hereford County Hospital, earning up to £840 for 12 hours. Dr Nick Dawson blew the whistle on his ex-lover after his wife, Marianne (right) accessed Lucy Dawson's Twitter account and found a string of boasts about her alleged fraud . She mocked the NHS for paying her double to fill last-minute shifts, the court heard. Prosecutor Carl Harrison said: ‘Dawson . was employed in the  accident and emergency department at the Royal . Gwent Hospital in Newport. ‘While on fully paid leave she worked . ten shifts at hospitals in Worcester and Hereford, earning £7,840. She . was signed off from work with stress and depression but went on to the . networking site Twitter. Allegations: Dr Lucy Dawson has faced claims that she boasted of earning the huge sums while she was signed of work with sickness . ‘She said that she was earning . megabucks and a stupid amount of dosh. She also tweeted about drinking . wine and other things such as “nightshift Monday, debauchery Tuesday”.’ The court heard Dawson also sent out . Twitter messages about the Aneurin Bevan Health Board, her employer at . the Newport hospital since 1989. She tweeted, ‘They lie and bully people’ and said she could not work for people she ‘wanted to kill’. While working at the Royal Gwent, Dawson had a 13-year affair with  her boss, emergency medicine  consultant Mr Jenkins. The court heard the relationship was ‘a fairly well-known matter’ among their colleagues at the hospital. The married doctor, 56, said the pair . split up acrimoniously in  2006, before Dawson went off sick, and she . started sending ‘unwanted communications’ to his wife and  her family. Dr Jenkins’s wife Marianne, 53, began . monitoring Dawson’s Twitter account and noticed her messages about . working in other hospitals. The father of five said he did not . look at his ex-lover’s Twitter account and that it was his wife who had . ‘flagged up’ the messages to him. He told the jury: ‘It was an . acrimonious split and afterwards myself, my wife and my wife’s family . began receiving unwanted communications from Lucy Dawson. ‘My wife would look at her Tweets to . see if we could expect any more unwanted communications. She would do it . to gauge her mind-set. ‘My wife later showed me Twitter pages . with Lucy Dawson’s  comments on them. These were fully accessible to . the public and showed up using an internet search. Rebuttal: Dr Lucy Dawson says the allegations, made by a former lover, are untrue . ‘My wife said to me: “Look it’s on . Twitter that she’s working elsewhere.” I knew she was on sick  leave and . I heard she had been working at another hospital. I felt I had a . professional obligation to deal with this so I called the fraud . hotline.’ Dawson has since resigned from her job at the 800-bed hospital. Alun Jenkins, defending, said she was genuinely depressed and stressed by ‘poisonous issues’ in the casualty department. He described her as a ‘whistle-blower’ who had previously raised complaints about colleagues  failing to carry . out jobs properly. Dawson, of Monmouth, South Wales, . denies two charges of fraud relating to ten days of sick leave in . October 2009 and a further six months from November that year. The trial continues.

Until this week, Gary Jones had never been to watch his daughter compete in taekwondo.The prospect of seeing his eldest child, Jade, 19, get kicked in the head for trophies was ‘too scary’ to see. But on Thursday a very proud – and sometimes still scared – Mr Jones was feet away when she realised her Olympic dream. In a tight final, the petite blonde from Flint, a small town in North Wales, beat the Chinese two-time world champion to become Britain’s first taekwondo gold medallist and the youngest Team GB gold medal winner of the Games so far. Scroll down for video . Early promise: Jade Jones is pictured as a nine-year-old (left) demonstrating a taekwondo move for the camera, and celebrating ten years later (right) after becoming the first Britain to win a gold medal for the sport . Baby-face: It's hard to believe the cute youngster pictured in these childhood snaps would grow up to earn the nickname 'the Headhunter' for her fighting prowess . ‘My head is still in the clouds,’ said Mr Jones, a 40-year-old fisherman and cockle picker. ‘Proud is not the word, to see your daughter competing and win a gold medal in the Olympics, it’s unbelievable. I’m so happy for her. ‘To see Jade on that medal rostrum, I had tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat. I still can’t believe she pulled it off.’ Mr Jones, a father of three, admitted he had hated watching at times during her winning bout at the ExCeL arena. ‘Until now I couldn’t bear to watch her fight,’ said. ‘But she made me go and see her this time, I obviously couldn’t miss her at the Olympics. ‘At times I couldn’t look and wanted to run off, it’s scary watching your daughter getting kicked. But I watched every round, I screamed and shouted as loud as I could with the crowd, it was very tense.’ Referring to the next Olympics, in Brazil in 2016, he added: ‘I’m going to have to pick a fair few cockles to try and get myself to Rio now that I’ve broken my duck of going to watch her compete.‘She’s the best in the world now, so hopefully nobody will be knocking her out for the foreseeable future.’ On top of the world: Taekwondo fighter Jade Jones shows off her gold medal - the 25th won by Team GB at London 2012 . Kiss of glory: Jade Jones is Great Britain's first Olympic taekwondo champion . MrJones had made the trip to London with Jade’s mother, Jayne Ferguson, 40, and grandfather, Martin Foulkes. Mr Foulkes, 57 – her mother’s stepfather – introduced Jade to the sport at the age of eight to keep her ‘off the streets’. Although they split when Jade was just nine, her parents, who live less than a quarter of a mile apart in Flint, remain on good terms and she is close to both of them. Jade, raised in a council block with her 13-year-old brother Luke, was a pupil at Gwynedd Primary School when she got hooked on the Korean martial art. And, as our exclusive pictures show, Jade’s talent soon began to shine. She won student of the year at her club several times and filled the trophy cabinet at her grandparents’ house with awards, including national titles. To pursue her dream of a gold medal, at 15 she switched from International Taekwondo Federation rules to the World Taekwondo Federation code, used in the Olympics. By that point she had outgrown her local club, so her grandfather, who works as an engineer in a factory, devoted much of his spare time to driving her the 60 miles to train at the Manchester Aces Club, four times a week after school.

Jubilation: Jade leapt into the arms of her coach Paul Green as the pair celebrated her victory over China's Hou Yuzhuo . Sweet moment: Taekwondo fighter Jade Jones celebrates winning Team GB's 25th gold medal of London 2012 . ‘It’s been hard, Jade’s not come from a wealthy background,’ her father said. ‘Her grandfather has done an immense amount for her, taking her to training, covering her expenses, and we’ve given her what we can along the way.’ She did well academically, passing nine GCSEs ‘with flying colours,’ but left Flint High School at 16 to take up the sport full-time. Her former headmistress Pam McClean was among the crowd to watch her fight on Thursday. She said: ‘We all knew she was good, but we hadn’t realised just how fantastically good she was.’ Jade, nicknamed ‘The Headhunter’ because of her liking for kicking opponents in the head, said she barely slept after her win. ‘I only had one hour’s sleep, I was just lying in bed awake,’ she said. ‘It was an unbelievable day, I always went there with the aim of getting gold and I knew I could win, but I knew it was going to be hard.’ ‘I just gave it my everything and ended up on top, so I’m just buzzing.’ Yesterday the streets of Flint were also ‘buzzing’ with Jade’s success. The night before, more than 300 people had packed into the town’s sports and social club, standing on tables and cheering as they watched their girl bring home the gold. Jade comes from a large extended family – her father has around 50 cousins – and almost all of the 12,000-strong Flint population seemed to be claiming some relation to her yesterday. Many can boast of having had a hand in her career, after they clubbed together to raise the £1,600 Jade needed to get to the 2010 Junior Olympic qualifiers in Singapore – where she won gold. Houses, pubs, businesses and shops were decked in Union Jack bunting and Jade’s face beamed from posters in their windows.

Rescue: The boy was placed on a stretcher before being airlifted to hospital after rescue workers managed to free him from the sand . He is thought to have been digging in the dune at Budle Bay when the sand began to collapse. The boy was airlifted to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle following the dramatic rescue, and is now said to be 'fit and well'. Northumbria Police were called to the beach at 2.15pm on Sunday. A Great North Air Ambulance Service helicopter and personnel from HM Coastguard and North East Ambulance Service also attended the scene. Sgt Vicky Quinn, of Northumbria Police, said: 'We had a report of this child buried in the sand. 'We got a call about 2.15pm. He is out now, I am led to believe he is fit and well.' Jim Entwistle, from the GNAAS, said: 'He must have been buried for a couple of hours. 'It was quite a long rescue. I know they managed to get his head free so he could breathe.

As such a custom made Land Rover given to Winston Churchill on his 80th birthday had to be fitted with an extra-wide passenger seat to accommodate his ample rump. Now the rare Series 1 vehicle, which also features a special wooden box believed to be for the cigar-smoking statesman's bricklaying tools, is set to fetch £60,000 when it goes up for auction in October. Me and my Rover: This rare series 1 Land Rover, given to Winston Churchill as an 80th birthday present, is set to make £60,000 when it goes under the hammer in October . The 4x4 was used to ferry Churchill around his sprawling 300 acre Chartwell estate in Kent after he retired from political life - and almost 58 years later still only has 12,000 miles on the clock. The vehicle was used to tow a family’s horse box for almost 20 years before they put it away for storage - aware of its fascinating provenance. It comes with a log book and tax disk emblazoned with Churchill’s name proving its previous VIP ownership. Manufacturers also added a padded fold-down arm rest, a lather clad grab handle fitted to the bulk head and a specially designed foot-well heater - handy for those chilly Kent mornings. ...And how she looks now: Fifty-eight years later the custom made Land Rover is in good condition and still only has 12,000 miles on the clock . Provenance: The log book shows the signature of the Rt Hon Sir Winston Spencer Churchill. The 4x4 was used to ferry Churchill around his 300acre Chartwell estate in Kent after he retired from political life . Auctioneers expect the Land Rover to fetch more than 375 times the £150 Churchill’s relatives sold it on for, more than 15 years after his death. Auctioneer Jeremy Curzon said: 'In view of Churchill’s position as the foremost statesman of the 20th century we expect a lot of interest.' Churchill retired from politics in 1955, ten years before his death aged 90. The vehicle was then passed onto his son-in-law the Rt Hon Christopher Soames. It was then sold off for just £160 in a farm sale in the early 1970s to a man called Norman Mills.He had no idea how to get the Land Rover home and asked friend Frank Quay to help him transport it. For the larger person: The Land Rover was fitted with an extra-wide passenger seat to accommodate Churchill's ample rump, a foot heater and a special box said to be for his bricklaying tools . When Mr Quay, the current owner, looked at the log book and saw who the original owner was he immediately bought the car for double the price. Bizarrely It was then used by the Quay family to tow their horse box for a number of years before being stored away in a shed for safe keeping. Mr Quay believes Churchill used the wooden box, specially fitted into the pick-up bed for storing a trowel and mortar so Churchill could indulge his hobby for bricklaying whenever it suited him. The car will go under the hammer on October 20 at Cheffins auction house in Sutton, Cambs.","4x4 has only got 12,000 miles on the clock .

The Coalition is facing a serious crisis of public confidence as five out of six voters now believe it will not survive until the 2015 General Election. And the number who think the Government will collapse early has doubled in a fortnight as the Lib Dems and Tories continue to squabble in public, a new poll has revealed. It is more bad news for David Cameron and Nick Clegg, who have fallen out over reforming the House of Lords and constituency boundary changes. Confidence crisis: Only one in six voters now believe the Coalition will survive to May 2015 because David Cameron and Nick Clegg continue to squabble . The two leaders are continuing to stick together on the economy, but if they were to row over that then it could spell the end for the partnership. According to a Guardian/ICM poll only 16 per cent said the Coalition will survive to May 2015. This has halved from the 33 per cent who thought this when asked the same question two weeks ago. Meanwhile the number who think it will last to a few months before the 2015 election has also dropped from 23 per cent a fortnight ago to 19 per cent. And 43 per cent think it will implode in the next two years - double the 23 per cent who though this in late July. Happier times: Prime Minister David Cameron with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg at their first joint press Conference in the Rose garden of Number 10 Downing Street in May 2010 . One in ten think the Lib Dem/Tory pact will break up even quicker. The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister met for a 'clear the air' dinner on Friday to patch up the Coalition feud over reform of the House of Lords and parliamentary boundary changes. It is understood the two agreed to stop squabbling and focus on the economy instead before they both go on holiday today, leaving Foreign Secretary  William Hague to run the country. The dinner in the Prime Minister’s flat was attended by the four senior members of the Coalition – the  so-called ‘Quad’ of Mr Cameron, Chancellor George Osborne, Mr Clegg and Liberal Democrat Treasury Minister Danny Alexander. It came after mounting fears that the Coalition is on the verge of collapse. Mr Clegg last week retaliated against Mr Cameron’s failure to back him over House of Lords reform by publicly vowing to sabotage the Prime Minister’s plan to approve changes in parliamentary constituencies, which would boost Conservative hopes of winning the next Election. Guests: Chancellor George Osborne and . Liberal Democrat Treasury Minister Danny Alexander were also invited to . the 'clear the air' dinner on Friday night . In an interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mr Cameron said Mr Clegg was wrong to oppose moves to reduce the number of MPs and address the growing imbalance in the number of voters in each constituency. The Prime Minister said that the  Lib Dems had broken their pledge to allow boundary changes in exchange for last year’s referendum on scrapping Britain’s first-past-the-post General Election voting system – which was defeated. Mr Cameron said he had invited Mr Clegg to dinner to put the recent disputes behind them and ‘hammer out what we will be doing this autumn and into the future’. Mr Cameron said: ‘I wouldn’t be giving up my Friday night to sit down with the Lib Dems if I didn’t want a bold reforming long-term government. 'Yes, there are arguments, but there are arguments in one-party governments too.’ Two polls published in other newspapers suggested the Olympics had done little to shift opinion on who to vote for. YouGov, for the Sunday Times, put Labour on 42%, the Conservatives on 34% and the Lib Dems and Ukip on 8% each.","Number who think Lib Dem/Tory pact will end early has also doubled in two weeks .

File picture . A gigolo PE teacher who was jailed for running a brothel after class was today found guilty of professional misconduct and now faces a potential lifetime ban from his profession. Tim Blake-Powell, 51, pimped out six women - including his ex-wife - and also worked as a prostitute himself from a flat in the well-heeled cathedral city of Canterbury, Kent. He was jailed for nine months in 2009 for running the brothel. He had moonlighted as a pimp while working as a teacher at the King Ethelbert School in Birchington, near Margate, Kent, between 2004 and 2007. Yesterday Blake-Powell was found guilty of breaching the teaching code of conduct when he appeared at a disciplinary hearing of the Teaching Agency in Conventry. The father-of-two was told his actions had placed him in 'direct contravention of the teaching code of conduct. 'The existence of this conviction surely undermines public confidence in the teaching profession and affects Mr Blake-Bowell’s ability to provide an effective learning environment for his pupils,' said presenting officer Mary Page. 'It is in direct contravention of section eight of the code of conduct, which state a teacher must maintain reasonable standards in his own behaviour, always trying to maintain an effective learning environment and maintaining public trust in the profession.' Blake-Bowell had been a 'dedicated teacher' at the 700-pupil King Ethelbert School, a mixed comprehensive which takes children between 11 and 16, where he was fanatical about hockey and cricket, the panel heard. But after work he sold his body and managed a team of six other prostitutes, including his then-wife Emma, 40, from a rented flat in Canterbury. At his trial in 2009, Canterbury Crown Court heard Blake-Bowell was responsible for the financial affairs of the brothel, which was variously named 'Gem's', 'Pandora's' and 'Men For All Seasons'. He paid the women they employed and took care of day to day tasks like bills and rent. While selling your body for money is not illegal in England, profiting from others' prostitution is. Emma, 40, who had herself worked as an escort in the city since 2004, was in charge of the day-to-day running of the business. She acted as a receptionist, worked out the girls’ rotas, introduced them to clients and also prostituted herself. The couple, who have two young children, split up after their arrest in December 2007. Blake-Bowell admitted a charge of controlling prostitutes for financial gain in July 2009 and was jailed for nine months, but was released after serving just four months of his sentence. His ex-wife Emma also pleaded guilty to the charge, but her nine-month sentence was suspended, with the judge saying she had been susceptible to pressure from her husband due to her vulnerable mental health. Blake-Bowell, 47, paid £560 a month to rent the Canterbury flat and spent another £1,400 a month on advertising. The brothel was staffed from 11am until midnight with the women charging £40 for a massage, £60 for 30 minutes of sex and £100 for a full hour. Although the Blake-Bowells used only willing British women, their operation was uncovered during a Kent Police probe into illegal sex-trafficking from Eastern Europe. At her trial Emma, who has two more children by a previous husband, was described as a working prostitute who called herself ‘Brandy’. She was also the brothel's 'meeter and greeter'. Shortly after his arrest in December 2007, Blake-Bowell lost his job at King Ethelbert School, although he was allowed to stay on until the end of term. At the time, school sources said they were astonished at his involvement, with one mother describing the sports master as a 'model teacher'. Blake-Bowell shed tears as a statement from his former headmaster was read out describing him as a 'valued and trusted colleague' who had shown 'unstinting commitment to those pupils in his pastoral care'. At the Teaching Agency panel today, chairman Dr Roland Kitchen said: 'We find Mr Blake-Bowell has been convicted of a relevant offence. A decision on whether he will be banned from teaching for life is expected in two weeks time. Blake-Bowell, who attended yesterday’s hearing confirmed he had given up teaching. He said: 'I have no plans to return to the profession.'","Tim Blake-Powell was  in 2009 jailed for nine months for running a brothel in Canterbury .

A bankrupt Pakistani man and his son managed to set up a business and cheat their local community out of almost £50,000 despite being in the UK illegally, a court heard. Siyed Asem, 58, and his son Syed Bukhari, 25, ran a corner shop and operated a Western Union money transfer service offering ‘excellent rates’ on transactions. But more than 20 customers who used the service to send money to India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, were left thousands of pounds out of pocket. Father and son partnership: Bankrupt Siyed Asem, left, and his son Syed Bukhari, right, together stole nearly £50,000 from their customers who had requested for the cash to be transferred to India . Jailing father and son for two years . each, Judge Jamie Tabor QC described their offences against their own . Asian community in Gloucester’s Barton area as ‘despicable.’ Judge . Tabor said it was ‘extraordinary’ that the men had been able to run a . shop and set up the money transfer business when they were both illegal . overstayers and Asem was bankrupt. Asem . came to the UK on a visitor’s permit eight years ago and never left. His son was in the UK on a student permit which would not allow him to . work or run a business. Gloucester crown court heard that the service operated legitimately at first but the pair soon started stealing the money - which amounted to a total of £48,206. One of their customers, retired Khadijabbi Mulla, lost £1,000 he requested to be transferred to India to pay for his operation there. Prosecutor Lisa Hennessy said: 'He was told it would take 8 weeks, which would take him close to the date of his operation. 'When he got to India he still had not received the promised PIN number to access his money. 'He . contacted a friend in Gloucester to ask him to complain and the message . he got back was that he would get a refund when he got back. Jailed: Siyed Asem and Syed Bukhari were sentenced to two years in prison at Gloucester Crown Court . 'He has never received a refund - as he puts it he has just had lots of excuses and delays.' Mrs Hennessy said another victim of the con, Fatima Kazi, paid the men £1,500 to be transferred to India to help fund the building of a mosque in her late father’s memory. Mrs Hennessy continued: 'The money never arrived.' She detailed how other customers lost money in similar transactions - Runara Begum and her husband lost almost £5,500 which was supposed to be going to Bangladesh; Rashid Salloo lost £1,000 destined for India; Yusuf Chand transferred £7,000 to India in two transactions but it never arrived. There were other customers who had transferred significant sums and either received nothing or were given very small refunds, she added. Mrs Hennessy said all the offences occurred within a few months between late 2010 and early 2011 after Bukhari applied in October 2010 to become an agent for Finit UK, a Western Union money transfer company. The application was granted and he was approved after ‘various checks had been carried out’. Mrs Hennessy told the court the fact that both men were illegal immigrants didn't appear to 'have come up on the checks'. She added that they also failed to notice that Asem had been made bankrupt in 2008. Fraud: The pair set up a Western Union money transfer service but stole thousands of pounds from customers that was meant to be sent to India . Bukhari admitted 11 offences of fraud - of masking false representations to customers that his money transfer business was in a sound financial position and that money would be transferred at a preferential rate of exchange - between January and March 2011. Asem admitted 12 similar charges. Mrs Hennessy said Bukhari was responsible for £33,688 of the total fraud and Asem £14,518. Sabhia Pathan, defending, said Bukhari had come to Britain legitimately to study to be a chartered accountant but had started working at McDonald’s to earn some money and then had opened the shop with his father. Asem had trusted his son’s business acumen and joined him in the venture but the money transfer service had quickly gone wrong because they were offering such good exchange rates that they made no profit, she said. Ms Pathan said that Western Union had checked only Bukhari’s credit rating before allowing him to set up the service. She added that both men knew they were facing deportation after their sentences and Asem was fearful of going back to Pakistan because he has health problems which are better treated here. Despite his status he has been getting free medication, she said. Jailing the men, Judge Tabor said: 'Over a period of three months you stole just under £50,000 from many members of your local community. 'That money was entrusted to you to transfer abroad for a variety of purposes including allowing people to have operations and to help with a mosque and other charitable tasks. 'People trusted you, especially you, father, because of the seniority that you held. I accept that when you started this business in November you ran it legitimately for a short period of time. 'But by the middle of January you were nothing more or less than confidence tricksters. You have done considerable damage to your community and you know it. 'These were despicable offences.' He told them police will now investigate their finances to see what can be confiscated from them under the Proceeds of Crime Act.","Bankrupt Siyed Asam, 58, and his son Syed Bukhari, 25, both stole money from customers using their Western Union money transfer service .

The outspoken two-time Olympic champion's autobiography, 'Solo: A Memoir of Hope', gives the 31-year-old's version of events after she described the decision to replace her for the United States' 4-0 defeat at the hands of Brazil 'the wrong decision'.

Replaced by Briana Scurry, then 36-years-old, who had acted as Solo's mentor during her time in the soccer set-up, the flamboyant goalkeeper spoke to the media after the defeat to explain why coach Greg Ryan had made 'the wrong decision.'

'It was our team captain Kristine Lilly. She said the veterans wanted to talk to me and asked if I would come to their room,' explained Solo in her memoir. 'I walked down the hall.

Solo reveals in her book that she found this to be 'overly dramatic.' 'They told me that you don't throw a teammate under the bus, that I had broken the code, that I had betrayed the team,' said Solo.

Returning to her room after being told their would be a team meeting in the morning subsequent to the veterans meeting, Solo describes how she spent the night in tears. In the morning, the controversial star was put in front of the squad to apologise and instead received a barrage of abuse. 'You don't sound sincere,' said one teammate. 'Do you even care what you've done? 'How can you turn your back on the team? 'Do you know how horrible you looked on television, pouting on the bench? 'You've been feeling sorry for yourself since Greg told you that you weren't starting. Some of us sit on the bench every game.' Solo explains that she was sent away from the meeting while the rest of her teammates decided her fate. 'Eventually, I was informed that my teammates had deemed my apology insincere,' explained Solo. 'I needed to be punished. They would not allow me to play in the third-place game. I couldn't even go to the game. I couldn't eat meals with the team. I was suspended.'

Canterbury Coroner’s Court heard she died from Sudden Adult Death Syndrome (SADS), a rare condition in which the heart mysteriously stops. Her father, 60, an MP for the Labour Party, was in Australia when police woke him to tell him the tragic news.

'I would place this in the category of natural causes from sudden adult death syndrome.'

He concluded Rebecca had almost certainly suffered a sudden cardiac death. Dr Anjarwalla said: 'There are around 500 cases a year of sudden adult death syndrome.

She returned to the house on the night of May 8 and spoke to two of her housemates before going to bed. The next day she told housemate and fellow American studies student Ceiridwen Fowles she felt ill. Rebecca said she would not be going to lectures and would be missing a trip to the cinema later that day. In a statement read out at the inquest, Miss Fowles said she had read messages from Rebecca on Twitter saying she had vomited twice and taken paracetamol.

For the service at St Paul’s Cathedral the Queen wore a soft mint coat dress: as for the flotilla on Sunday, it is again designed by her dresser, Angela Kelly. It is of silk tulle, embroidered with flowers, using silver thread. A chiffon drape is a lovely, soft touch: it is studded with Swarovski crystals, and a matching drape adorns the hat. The Duchess of Cambridge’s nude lace dress by Sarah Burton for McQueen was tailored perfectly to fit her figure – the hem a tad longer than the red dress for the flotilla on the Thames – and while I loved it, the fastening of the belt, seemingly made from bias binding, is a little disappointing. Thumbs up! Liz Jones applauded The Queen, the Duchess of Cambridge, the Duchess of Cornwall for their fashion choices . Kate (and Sarah Burton) need to understand that the Duchess will often be seen from behind, and therefore the detailing needs to be beautiful:  pearls or diamonds, with hand embroidered loops, not just a hook and eye. And I do want to wrestle Kate out of her platform patent pumps from LK Bennett. She needs delicate lace shoes, encrusted with pearls, by Manolo Blahnik, say, or an English shoe couturier, such as Georgina Goodman. The platform is a little too casual for such a formal occasion. But Kate still looked stunning, especially as her eye make-up has been softened: I love the subtle veil over her eyes, on a hat by her favourite milliner, Jane Taylor: £790, available on the milliner’s website. The real surprise of the day was that both Beatrice and Eugenie looked fresh, young and appropriate. Beatrice wore a blue and white striped coatdress by London Fashion Week designer Kinder Aggugini. Italian born, he studied at St Martin’s, and learned his craft on Savile Row and working for designers including Vivienne Westwood and John Galliano. Lady in red: The Duchess of Cambridge cut a . swathe through the gloomy weather as she stepped on to . the Spirit of Chartwell wearing a vibrant scarlet Alexander McQueen . dress - on her lapel, Kate wore a maritime-themed brooch featuring two . silver dolphins . 'I am starting to love these two young women,' Liz Jones says of Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie . This dress was teamed with tan stilettos . by Gina, a Stephen Jones hat and a Lemaresca bag, made by sisters . Giulia and Cecilia Maresca, who worked at Tod’s and Vivienne Westwood . before striking out on their own. This rock and roll bag label is made . from start to finish in Italy, not merely ‘finished’ there, as so many . are these days. This bag would have cost about £1,000. Princess Eugenie chose a royal purple dress by Suzannah (her lovely, small boutique is at 6 Bristol Gardens, in Little Venice); a Stephen Jones hat; Gina nude stilettos and a Loro Piana bag. I am starting to love these two young women: they champion brand new talent, know how to mix and match different labels, and have the good sense to wear Gina shoes, which are expensive but super stylish and comfy. Kate should follow suit, and abandon those high street platforms. She has such great legs: she really could take a dagger heel. Samantha Cameron wore a rose print dress by Paul Smith that we’ve seen before, but at least she wore a hat, by Stephen Jones. The Duchess of Cornwall wore a graphic, basket weave coat by Bruce Oldfield, and a ginormous Philip Treacy hat. Both items tell me she is feeling much more confident, starting to abandon those safe creams. All in all, a triumph.","'I do want to wrestle Kate out of her platform patent pumps from LK Bennett,' she says of the Duchess of Cambridge .

Missing: Rebecca Weiss, who co-owned two businesses with her husband, is said to have vanished while diving . Police are now questioning the husband of the California woman, who disappeared on . Saturday while free diving in the ocean, amid claims he was cheating on his wife. Police have been searching for Rebecca Weiss, 50, after she did not return home from a . diving expedition off the coast of Rancho Palos Verdes in California. But investigators say unusual circumstances related to her disappearance have led them to reclassify the case from a missing person investigation to a homicide. Homicide detectives are interviewing . her husband, Alan Weiss, in person for the first time, as the search efforts continue. They had . previously only spoken to him over the phone and say he has been cooperating so far with the investigation. Police interest in the husband comes after the mother of the missing businesswoman said her daughter suspected he was having an affair. Alan Weiss, 60, reported his wife missing . on Saturday evening after he found her personal belongings on the beach . and her car parked nearby after she failed to return from a diving trip. He was the last person to see her alive. Her mother told KTLA 5 that her daughter confided in her shortly before she disappeared that she suspected her husband was engaged in an extramarital relationship. Vilma Causey said: 'My daughter told me that she found it on the computer...He has a girlfriend.' As well as this, she said that while they are doing everything they can to find her daughter - including passing out flyers in the area - Alan Weiss has done nothing to help, which the family think is strange. She said of Weiss's behavior: 'Very bad, very strange. That is . not the reaction of a person that has somebody missing that is close to . you. 'Was she the only one on the beach to swim? Especially at that resort? No one saw her? No one saw her??' Mrs Causey also revealed her daughter's cell phone and keys are missing, but her credit cards and driving license were found. She was last seen by her husband leaving her condominium in a wetsuit and driving off in her car. Her brother also said it is hard to believe something could have gone wrong. 'My sister is a strong swimmer, and she was wearing a wetsuit, according to my brother-in-law,' Bob Causey said. 'So it would have to be something out of the extraordinary for something to happen to her out there.' Free diving is a form of underwater diving that does not involve the use of scuba gear or other external breathing devices. Instead, it relies on a diver's ability to hold his or her breath until resurfacing. Husband: Alan Weiss is accused of doing nothing to help find his wife and is said to have been having an affair . Danger spot: The Palos Verdes peninsula is a risky place to dive due strong currents and slippery rocks . Rebecca's mother Vilma Causey, left, said: '(Alan's behavior) is very bad, very strange. That is not the reaction of a person that has somebody missing that is close to you' The couple have been married 20 years . and seemed happy, according to friends, who said they traveled the . world and enjoyed their diving hobby together. Rebecca, who is described as being . 5ft 5in tall and weighing 115 pounds, co-owns two grocery . businesses with her husband. Her mother Mrs Causey said: 'There has to be somebody who must have seen. This is not an isolated place. This is a resort. There should have been people.' Her . clothes and other belongings were found near her BMW X5, which was . parked at the Terennea resort on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, near Los . Angeles, California. Mr Weiss told the LA Weekly blog . that his wife was ‘very experienced’ at free-diving, a discipline that . does not involve using any scuba gear and relies on the ability to hold . breath for up to three minutes. Those . who practice it are at risk of blacking out from running out of breath . and the sport is extremely dangerous without supervision.

Cabrillo crew and an LASD helicopter in an overnight search. Four divers with Baywatch Marina Del Rey have began sub-surface searches on Sunday and carried on yesterday. They will continue again today. According to Shareen Ghabrial, who lives above the search area, a sheriff's deputy at Vanderlip Park told neighbors that the woman was a frequent snorkeler.

Boris Johnson travelled up the Thames to HMS Severn to help launch London Poppy Day . The London Mayor travelled up the River Thams on a Royal Navy RIB, and was seen waving his helmet in the air as he arrived in style . After speeding along the river past some of the capital’s famous landmarks, Mr Johnson waved his helmet in the air as he pulled alongside HMS Severn at Canary Wharf.

A senior carer at a nursing home routinely drugged six dementia patients with unprescribed medication so she could get a good night’s sleep on the job, a court has heard. Mirela Aionoaei allegedly gave four women and two men anti-insomnia, anti-depressant and anti-psychotic pills before pushing two chairs together to form a makeshift bed and turning off the lights while working the night shifts. The drugs were so powerful that the poisoned patients, who previously would wander around during the night, fell into a sleep so deep they had to be taken to their beds in wheelchairs. Mirela Aionoaei (right), who is accused of drugging six dementia patients with anti-insomnia, anti-depressant and anti-psychotic pills, arriving at Harrow Crown Court . The jury heard how concerned staff at . the Southern Cross-owned home in Hayes, West London, became suspicious . after finding that the patients were unsteady on their feet and . suffering from slurred speech whenever Aionoaei was on duty. ‘The residents were being poisoned, . of that there is no doubt,’ prosecutor Guy Dilliway-Parry told Harrow . Crown Court on Monday. ‘The defendant liked to sleep when on duty. Why . else put two chairs together?’ ‘She was seen to administer on many . occasions over a considerable period of time and the residents would . fall asleep almost straight away.’ Aionoaei, 37, has pleaded not guilty . to six counts of administering a poison or noxious substance to the six . residents of Ashwood Care Centre between July 1 and December 31, 2010. Mirela Aionoaei is on trial at Harrow Crown Court where a jury was told she drugged six dementia patients . Aionoaei, who lives in a £150,000 . one-bedroom flat in Hayes, studied at the University of Westminster . according to her Facebook account. At the time of the alleged offences . there were 22 residents on the dementia ward, aged between 58 and over . 100 years old. Aionoaei was the senior member of staff in charge and the . only one permitted to dispense medicine as a trained and authorised . health professional. ‘They all suffered from mental health . conditions that left them vulnerable and unaware of their . surroundings,’ Mr  Dilliway-Parry said. ‘They could do very little for . themselves. ‘Some would walk around at night and . needed hourly checks, but Aionoaei would put two chairs together and go . to sleep, even if the residents were walking around. Her priority seemed . to be to get some sleep herself.’ 'The residents were being poisoned, of that there is no doubt.' Prosecutor Guy Dilliway-Parry .

"By . James Nye . PUBLISHED: . 22:56 EST, 22 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 23:58 EST, 22 August 2012 . Graham Spanier, the former Penn State University president who stepped down as a result of the Jerry Sandusky child-sex abuse scandal has denied that he ignored any warning signs during his tenure. Citing his own child abuse at the hands of his father, the 64-year-old former family therapist has come out fighting to restore his reputation after an independent report accused him of failing to prevent a 'child predator harming children for over a decade.' Claiming that he does not know, 'anyone who had a higher level of awareness' than himself, Spanier spoke of the terrible injuries that he received at the hands of his father, which resulted in him having four surgeries as an adult to correct the damage to his nose. Scroll Down for Video . Graham Spanier spoke to ABC's Nightline to explain that he did not cover-up Jerry Sandusky's sexual abuse while he was president of Penn State University . 'It resulted in, of course, some emotional scarring, but also some substantial physical damage,' said Spanier to ABC Nightline. Rejecting out of hand the findings of July's damning Freeh Report, Spanier calls its conclusions 'wrong'  and denied outright that 'he conspired to conceal a known child predator'. The former professor said that he was only told that Sandusky had engaged in 'horseplay' with a boy in the team showers in 2001 and that his mind did not automatically think of sexual abuse. The Freeh Report, which was commissioned by Penn State University openly questioned why Spanier failed to begin any investigation into Sandusky's behaviour. Graham Spanier explained that he was very sensitive to any child abuse allegations after suffering physical abuse for years at the hands of his father as a young boy . 'Never in my time as president of . Penn State did I ever receive a report or even a hint that Jerry . Sandusky was engaged in child abuse, a sexual act, criminal activity or . anything resembling that with any child,' said Spanier. 'Had I known that, or even suspected it, I would have forcefully intervened. But I never heard a report like that.' Furthermore, . Spanier told ABC's Nightline that he met Sandusky once only and was not . fully involved with a police investigation into another earlier . incident of child abuse conducted by Sandusky in 1998. 'I . do not get involved in police matters. I always had a very hands-off . attitude and issues pertaining to people were dealt with by the police, . by human resources, or by supervisors in various areas of the . university,' said Spanier of the 1998 incident which at the time led to . no charges against the former defensive coach. However, . during the second 2001 incident, Spanier received an email from . Athletic Director Tim Curley and retired Vice President Gary Shcultz . that spoke of letting Sandusky off with a warning after he was caught . with a boy in the showers. Spanier . agreed to this, but noted in an email that by failing to report it to . the police, they would be 'vulnerable for not having reported it.' Speaking to Nightline, Spanier said that his choice of words was unfortunate and that he had 'no recollection of being concerned' that the school might be leaving itself open to be legally liable. 'I never, ever heard anything about child abuse or sexual abuse or my antennae raised up enough to even suspect that. So I know that’s been taken out of context, and I suspect that whoever leaked those e-mails wanted them to be taken out of context,' said Spanier to the New Yorker Magazine. Graham Spanier told ABC's Nightline that he had little to no recollection of this meeting with Jerry Sandusky and only has one clear memory of ever speaking with him . Penn State president Graham Spanier and his lawyers also attacked the Freeh report on the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse scandal on Wednesday, calling it a 'blundering and indefensible indictment' as they fired a pre-emptive strike while waiting to hear if he'll be charged in the case. Lawyer Timothy Lewis called Louis Freeh, the former FBI director and federal judge behind the report, a 'biased investigator' who piled speculation on top of innuendo to accuse Spanier in a cover-up of early abuse complaints. 'The Freeh report, as it pertains to Dr. Spanier, is a myth. And that myth ... ends today,' Lewis said at a downtown Philadelphia news conference. Spanier did not attend. But he told media outlets in stories published hours later that he never understood the early complaints about Sandusky, who this year was convicted of molesting 10 boys, to be sexual. Guilty: Graham Spanier's once pristine reputation has been ruined after a damning report accused him of conspiring to protect defensive . coordinator Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted in June of multiple pedophilia charges . 'I'm very stunned by Freeh's conclusion that - I don't think he used the word `cover-up'; but he uses the word `concealed,'' Spanier told The New Yorker magazine. 'Why on earth would anybody cover up for a known child predator? Adverse publicity? For heaven's sake! Every day I had to make some decision that got adverse publicity.' Spanier told ABC that he was told only that Sandusky had been seen engaging in 'horseplay' in a campus shower with a boy and he took that to mean 'throwing water around, snapping towels.' 'I wish in hindsight that I would have known more about Jerry Sandusky and his terrible, terrible hidden past so that I could have intervened because it would have been my instinct to do so,' he said. The New Yorker interview was published online after ABC News began promoting its own interview with Spanier, set to air in parts on several of its networks Wednesday and Thursday. Sick: Sandusky (left, seen here in 1990) was . involved in a local charity which he went on to use as a way to find the . boys that he would 'groom' to be his victims . At the news conference, Lewis, also a former federal judge, complained that Freeh never interviewed key witnesses, ignored inconvenient facts and manipulated the truth. For instance, he said, the report assumes former graduate assistant Mike McQueary told coach Joe Paterno in 2001 that he saw something sexual in a locker room shower and that Paterno echoed that to athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz. Freeh likewise, he said, assumes that they in turn told Spanier the same thing. 'Curley and Schultz have denied that they ever told Dr. Spanier anything of the sort,' Lewis said. '`Horseplay' was referred to over and over again, but never with any sexual connotation or suggestion of abuse. But Judge Freeh paid no attention to that.' The Freeh group said Wednesday that it stands by its report. Its investigation uncovered documents that suggest Spanier had deeper knowledge of the early Sandusky complaints, including an email in which the president appeared to agree with Curley's decision to keep a 2001 assault from child-welfare authorities and instead work directly with Sandusky and Sandusky's charity for at-risk youths. Timothy Lewis, defense lawyer for former Penn State President Graham Spanier, speaks during a news conference Wednesday, Aug. 22, 2012, in Philadelphia . The 'Freeh Report' also pointed a finger at legendary football coach Joe Paterno who is accused of being complicit with Spanier in ignoring Sandusky's actions . 'The only downside for us is if the message isn't `heard' and acted upon, and we then become vulnerable for not having reported it,' said Spanier's email, dated Feb. 27, 2001. 'The approach you outline is humane and a reasonable way to proceed.' Spanier's four high-profile lawyers, who are being paid by Penn State, argue that Freeh took the email out of context. As for a 1998 report that Sandusky had showered with a boy - a complaint that led to a campus police investigation referred to county prosecutors - they note that prosecutors declined to charge Sandusky. 'There was thus nothing to conceal,' the lawyers wrote in a rebuttal to the report released Wednesday. Spanier and Paterno were ousted in November, days after Sandusky was charged. Sandusky, who maintains his innocence, awaits sentencing. Beaver Stadium: Much of Penn State University's growth and success over the past 50 years has derived from its stellar performances on the football field . Gone: The site outside Beaver Stadium where Joe . Paterno's statue once stood has been stripped of all monuments after . workers uprooted the statue honouring the late coach . Curley and Schultz are charged with perjury and failing to report suspected child abuse; they maintain their innocence, and their attorneys issued statements after Wednesday's broadcast also blasting the Freeh report. Spanier's lawyers said they don't know whether he will be charged. 'That's out of our control,' lawyer Jack Riley said. A spokesman in the attorney general's office has declined to comment on possible charges, while calling the Sandusky probe 'ongoing and active.' Former Penn State athletic director Tim Curley (left) and retired Vice President Gary Shcultz are facing charges relating to perjury as a result of what they knew regarding Jerry Sandusky's abuse . University trustee Anthony Lubrano, who attended the law firm news conference, said the board has never adopted Freeh's report, unlike current university President Rodney Erickson. 'I'd love for us to come out with a statement that says, we've never accepted this report,' Lubrano said. With Erickson's approval, the university has agreed to pay $60 million in NCAA fines over the scandal. Spanier, who remains a tenured faculty member at Penn State, has told trustees he would never cover up abuse because he himself had been physically abused as a boy by his father, as a form of discipline. 'Someday I hope to have my name completely cleared when it becomes evident that this was unfair and untrue,' Spanier told The New Yorker.","Graham Spanier denied any suggestion that he willfully ignored two separate reports of child sex molestation by Jerry Sandusky in 1998 and 2001 .

Tragic: Newlywed Ruby Lewis was found face down in the water on the second day of her honeymoon . A newly-married bride found in a swimming pool after a drinking binge on her honeymoon died from 'catastrophic brain injuries'. Ruby Lewis, 34, had been taking a dip in a pool at a private hospital in Crete while her husband Mark was receiving kidney dialysis treatment inside. However, the former British Airways hostess was found face down after 'gliding in' to the water on the second day of her honeymoon, an inquest heard. She died 11 days later in hospital without regaining consciousness after being flown back to the UK. The couple had been in a relationship for around seven years and married in April 2010 in Wetherby, West Yorkshire, the inquest was told. Mr Lewis also received a kidney transplant around the time of their wedding so they delayed their treatment for four months, jetting out in August 2010 to the luxury five-star Amirandes resort in Crete. The tragedy happened on the second day of their trip after the couple booked a short stay at a private hospital about 15 minutes away so Mr Lewis, now 38, could get dialysis treatment. The coroner heard how, while Mr Lewis was seen by doctors, his wife went to a bar and ordered a glass of a wine and a bottle of water. She then went to the village of Ano Kalessa, where she bought two small bottles of ouzo and some food. The credit controller, from . Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, returned to the hospital about three hours . later and told the receptionist she would be by the pool. She was found . 20 minutes later face down in the water. By the time a doctor pulled her from the water, she had stopped breathing and attempts were made to resuscitate her. Two bottles of ouzo were found next to her sun lounger. Mrs Lewis was taken to a hospital in Crete’s main city Heraklion, where doctors sedated her and placed her on a ventilator. Luxury holiday: The couple had delayed their honeymoon for four months and jetted out to the luxury five-star Amirandes resort in Crete (pictured) She was flown back to the UK on September 7 and died at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire after her husband agreed to switch off her life support machine when she was declared 'brain dead'. In a statement read out to the inquest, the doctor who tried to save her said he believed she had 'glided' into the water and said she had suffered a 'catastrophic brain injury'. A post-mortem gave her cause of death as an 'acute global cerebral infarction' due to asphyxia and water immersion. There were no signs of external injury. Blood tests taken by Greek authorities revealed that Ruby had a 'very high' level of alcohol in her blood at the time of the incident. Mrs Lewis was flown back to the UK but her life support machine was switched off at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire (pictured) when she was pronounced 'brain dead' The hearing was told Ruby who graduated in English Literature at Staffordshire University was a BA air stewardess for six years but changed career after the 9/11 terror attacks. She went to Korea to teach for a year but suffered a head injury and started to suffer from epilepsy as a result. North Staffordshire deputy coroner Anthony Curzon recorded a verdict of accidental death. In a statement at the time of the tragedy, the dead woman's younger sister said: 'The whole family is devastated. 'Ruby and Mark had just got married and settled down. They were happy newlyweds and this was supposed to be one of their happiest times together - their honeymoon.

Long distance swimmer Diana Nyad, who turns 63 tomorrow, was out of the water this morning after weathering severe storms and jellyfish stings. Nyad, who was attempting a historic swim from Cuba to Florida, emerged from the water at 7:42 am EST. Team members were unsure of the veteran swimmer would be able to complete the 103-mile crossing. She was making her third attempt since last . summer to become the first person to cross the Florida Straits without a . shark cage. She also made a failed try with a cage in 1978. Throwing in the towel: Endurance swimmer Diana Nyad is aided after she was pulled out of the water between Cuba and the Florida Keys early Tuesday, left, and is seen resting, right, with a bad sunburn and swollen lips . Recovery: The 62-year-old was badly burned from spending nearly 60 hours straight in the water; her lips were also swollen from jellyfish stings . All wet: Endurance swimmer Diana Nyad, pictured swimming yesterday in the Florida Straits, was pulled out of the water just before 8am today . Support crew: Nyad, pictured on August 19, has a team of crew members assisting her historic 103-mile swim; she was attempting the swim without a shark cage . Steve Munatones, a member of Nyad’s support crew, told Good Morning America today that the 62-year-old grandmother is in bad shape. ‘She has deep welts due to the box jellyfish stings,’ he began, adding that Nyad is also severely sunburned, as well as a strained bicep and weakness. ‘She gave it all she can,’ he said. Nyad had planned to land somewhere in the Florida Keys on Tuesday, a day ahead of her 63rd birthday on Wednesday. But it would have taken her another 28 to 40 hours to complete the crossing at the time she finally gave up, Reuters reported. 'Instead of getting hit with one doozy they got hit with three,' team member Vanessa Linsley told the Associated Press. 'They got hit with the weather, they got hit with the jellyfish and they got hit with the sharks all at the same time.' She continued: 'They are discussing with Diana as to how she wants to proceed.' Once bitten: Nyad, off the coast of Havana, Cuba, takes a break on August 18 after being stung by a jellyfish; she is covered by protective paint to ward off hypothermia . Try, try again: This is Nyad's third time since last summer trying to swim across the Strait . Likely culprit: Nyad's team members aid she was stung repeatedly by box jellyfish, also known as sea wasps (stock image) The overnight hours Tuesday marked the second straight night of storms encountered by the swimmer. 'They got hit with the weather, they got hit with the jellyfish . and they got hit with the sharks all at the same time.' -Team member Vanessa Linsley . On Monday evening, the swimmer's crew was improvising ways to prevent hypothermia and to fend off further swelling of her lips and tongue. Though she's swimming in 85-degree waters, because that is lower than the body's core temperature, it will reduce her body temperature over time. Her team said she had been shivering. 'We all know her mind can handle it,' Candace Hogan, a crew member traveling with Nyad, wrote on the swimmer's blog. 'But there will always be a point where a human body can't go any farther. What no one knows is where that line is drawn in Diana Nyad.' Readying: Nyad, pictured on August 18 before commencing her swim, adjusts her swimming cap as a woman applies a protective ointment to her skin . Making a splash: Nyad jumps into the water to start her swim to Florida from Havana, Cuba on the 18th . Support team: Revelers and members of the media watched as Nyad leaped into the water . Australian Susie Maroney successfully swam the Straits in 1997, but she used a shark cage. In June, another Australian, Penny Palfrey, made it 79 miles toward Florida without a cage before strong currents forced her to abandon the attempt. Nyad has already endured jellyfish stings on the current attempt. Stings forced her to cut short her second of two attempts last year as toxins built up in her system. She has been training for three years for the feat. She is accompanied by a support team in boats, and a kayak-borne apparatus shadowing Nyad helps keep sharks at bay by generating a faint electric field that is not noticeable to humans. A team of handlers is always on alert to dive in and distract any sharks that make it through. She takes periodic short breaks to rest, hydrate and eat high-energy foods such as peanut butter. When she was pulled from the water, she had been awake for some 60 hours straight.","Diana Nyad, who turns 63 tomorrow, forced to delay swim after storms and box jellyfish stings .

Lucy Hemms, 18, was delighted to reach the semi-finals of Young Slimmer of the Year after shedding her teenage puppy fat. But the teenager became addicted to dieting and restricted herself to just 200 calories a day - the equivalent of two bananas. Lucy today told how her hair dropped out, she started suffering from arthritis and she developed 'old people’s' skin. Lucy Hemms, 18, became obsessed with losing weight after reaching the semi-finals of Young Slimmer of the Year. Her weight plummeted to 7st 12lbs giving her a Body Mass Index of 15.7 - classified as 'severe health risk' Lucy said: 'I was weighing myself six times a day - I started dieting and couldn’t stop. 'People were saying I looked terrible but when I looked in the mirror I still thought I was fat.' Lucy started dieting at 15 after being bullied about being 14 stone while she was studying for her GCSE examinations. She joined Slimming World with her mum Jillian and lost 3st 5lb in just six months. Lucy was nominated for the weight loss club’s Young Slimmer of the Year award and reached the national semi-finals. Lucy was bullied for her weight growing up - and became hooked on the idea of losing weight when the pounds dropped off . She was praised by the slimming company for her 'healthy weight loss'. But keen operatic singer Lucy returned home to Blackwood, South Wales, where she carried on cutting her daily calorie intake. She . went down to 7st 12lbs which, because of her height, gave her a Body . Mass Index of 15.7 - classified as a 'severe health risk'. Lucy said: 'I was eating just 200 calories a day for for about a year. 'My skin was bad like a much older person and I got arthritis in my ankles.'My hair fell out and I had to wear a wig for a long time. 'My mum’s a hairdresser and learned how to put hair extensions in, but that wasn’t possible because I had too little hair.' Her worried family took her to the doctor who diagnosed Lucy with potentially fatal anorexia nervosa. Lucy has been battling the illness since for the last three years and has come close to being admitted to hospital. She has been banned from weighing herself and given counselling to help her overcome the eating disorder. Lucy was given liquid nutrition, normally for elderly malnourished people, and her weightslowly started to increase . She . is now studying music at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in . Cardiff, and has been inspired by her heroine Welsh mezzo soprano . Katherine Jenkins. Lucy said: 'It has been a terrible time - I went from being so big that I was being bullied to so thin I could have died. 'I was very proud to lose so much weight but I just couldn’t stop dieting. 'Every time I weighed and saw I’d lost a pound it felt like a success. 'I couldn’t see how thin I was getting and how ill I was becoming.' Lucy, who at one stage admits to taking laxatives to stay thin, says today that battling the illness was a 'terrible time' Lucy believes teenagers are pressurised into being thin by images of models in magazines and on TV. And she is backing calls for child and adolescent eating disorder services to be funded to the same level as that for adults. She said: 'I think it’s just as important, if not more important, to support children and adolescents. 'If they have not fully developed into an adult the effects of an eating disorder on their body can influence their whole lives.' Mother Jillian, 48, said: 'I thought I was going to lose my daughter. She was seven-and-a-half stone and five foot ten - she looked so fragile. 'She was taking laxatives to keep herself thin and some days she would not eat at all. I was buying her clothes for 11 to 12 year old children. 'She sank into a deep depression and would spend hours in bed under her quilt. All she thought about was weighing herself. If she put on even a pound she would be besides herself.' 'Anorexia is such a cruel disease and there is no support for children under 18 really. 'It was the worst time of my life too - I just couldn’t pull her out of her obsession. I really thought she might die. 'She is now on the road to recovery and I have my daughter back.'

A 37-year-old Czech fireman says he is able to live 'like a healthy man', after having his heart removed and replaced by mechanical pumps six month ago. Jakub Halik no longer has a pulse after becoming only the second man to undergo the procedure - the first died a month after surgery in Texas last year. The father-of-one still lives in the hospital and . is confined to his wheelchair for much of the day but says he is lucky . to be alive at all. He hopes to receive a donor heart and eventually return to the force. Mr Halik had to have the . extraordinary surgery after he was diagnosed with an aggressive tumour . growing inside his heart. He couldn't  undergo a standard transplant because the drugs he would require afterwards cannot be taken by cancer patients. So, . on April 3 this year his heart was removed in an eight-hour operation . led by Czech cardiologist Jan Pirk. In its stead they placed two . modified Heartmate 2 pumps, manufactured by US company Thoratec Corp. Mr Halik said: 'It . was hard for me but I didn't have any other chance at all. It was . acknowledged that with the tumour I can survive for about one year and I . decided to fight and do it this way,' he said. Professor . Pirk's team used two pumps, which look like an eight-inch piece of . plumbing to the untrained eye. Inside, is a propeller that spins at . 10,000 rotations per minute replicating the pumping action of the heart. Thoratec . makes the pumps for people with damaged or diseased hearts as they . await a suitable heart for transplant. The pumps are powered by . batteries worn externally that connect to the device via a controller . and flexible cable beneath the skin. Jakub Halik's siutaion however was unique. Reuters reported that with no heart at all, he required two pumps. Each pump is designed to perform the separate tasks of the left and right sides of the heart. One of the devices pumps blood to the lungs for oxygenation while the other sends the oxygenated blood back into the ciculatory system. The continuous-flow pump should last . longer than other artificial hearts and cause fewer problems as each . side had just one moving part. The one thing they cannot replicate however, is the pulse. 'I . don't even realize it, because the functions of the body are the same, . only my heart is not beating and I have no pulse anymore,' Mr Halik . said. 'This is the only difference but otherwise I am functioning like a healthy man at present.' Mr Halik sits in front of a graphic explaining how the two heart pumps keep him alive . This X-ray shows the dual-heart pump of Craig Lewis, who was the first man to receive dual pumps. Mr Halik has had a very similar device implanted . The first time the procedure was . attempted, it extended the life of Craig Lewis, 55, for more than one . month before the disease that made the procedure necessary, travelled to . his kidneys and liver and killed him. Jakub . Halik, a husband and father of one, is hoping that his pumps will keep . him alive until a suitable donor heart becomes available. 'It . was hard for me on both sides - psychically and more physically - this . just from the beginning. Later more psychically because I was . undertaking the search for more tumor cells (metastasis). At present I . feel very good physically and psychically as well.' Mr Halik would one day like to return to fire-fighting . Mr Halik must carry a battery that supplies the pumps with him everywhere he goes. But he isn't bed-bound. He said: 'My usual day goes like breakfast, hygiene, than lunch and after that I have usually visit, because my family visits me every day. Than I am doing rehabilitation like walking - sometimes I go to walk outside, which is very pleasant.' 'I am looking forward to going home, to meet my whole family, my dog, to be with them again. Then in summer I would like to make holidays at the sea.' Dr Pirk says he is delighted with his patient's progress. He said: 'Mr Halik has a very strong personality and I am satisfied with the result. We didn't know how it will go on and from the very beginning it was not easy, his health status was very serious and only thanks to the systematic hard work of the whole team of doctors and nurses. 'Mr Halik is now in this good condition. He is doing his best, he is training hard because after two months of laying on bed the muscles are getting weak and he has to make them stronger now.' Jakub Halik is one of 24 patients in the Czech Republic who are waiting for a new heart. At the Institute for Clinic and Experimental Medicine (IKEM) the average waiting time is eight months.","Father-of-one is only man in the world to have two artificial pumps working side by side instead of a heart .

Two months after delivering a petition with 84,000 signatures to the editor-in-chief, Julia Bluhm has convinced Seventeen against altering and airbrushing its models to tiny and blemish-free proportions. Seventeen’s editor-in-chief, Ann .

Victory: Seventeen's editor-in-chief, Ann Shoket (left), responded to Julia Bluhm (right) and campaign in the magazine's latest issue, vowing that the magazine will never change the shapes of girls' bodies or faces . Ms Shoket acknowledged that the magazine had been contacted by . readers who felt it was digitally enhancing photos and wondered if the . magazine had 'gone too far,' after teenagers gathered outside Seventeen . magazine's New York office to protest Seventeen's fervent use of airbrushing two months ago. The eight-grade student started the . online petition to the teen magazine in hopes it would change its . Photoshopping policies and in turn help promote more positive, and . realistic, body images among teen readers. The teenagers also demanded that . editors of the Hearst title 'commit to printing one unaltered - real - . photo spread per month.' 'Seventeen listened!' Miss Bluhm wrote Tuesday in a message posted on Change.org, a social petition facilitation website. 'They’re saying they won’t use Photoshop to digitally alter their models. This is a huge victory, and I’m so unbelievably happy.' After her success with Seventeen magazine, Miss Bluhm has now decided to tackle Teen Vogue, posting a new online petition asking the teen fashion magazine to follow Seventeen’s example and 'pledge not to alter any model’s body or face and to celebrate beauty in all its forms'. Miss Bluhm said during the May protest outside Seventeen magazine's offices: 'I know much how much pictures in the media have an effect in the self esteem of girls and their body image.' Rea teens: Julia Bluhm, 14, stood outside the magazine's Midtown headquarters and led a protest against the industry's fervent use of Photoshop, before hand delivering her petition with 84,000 signatures . The magazine said it invited Miss Bluhm to its offices after seeing her petition, called Seventeen Magazine: Give Girls Images Of Real Girls! Ms Shokot’s letter to readers also . provides insight into the magazine’s photography and why it decided to . create a Body Peace Treaty, endorsed by the National Eating Disorders Association and the Commission for Positive Images of Women and Girls, which it hopes will help young girls stop obsessing about their bodies. Shokot said Seventeen retouches . images, removing wrinkles in fabric, stray hairs, pimples and bra . straps, but never alters the way the girls 'really' look. She admitted the petition campaign made her realise that the magazine had to be more public about its commitment, which led to the Body Peace Treaty. The treaty contains eight conditions . that Seventeen magazine’s staff must abide by, including 'never change . girls’ body or face shapes (Never have, never will).' The treaty says the magazine will . 'celebrate every kind of beauty in our pages. Without a range of body . types, skin tones, heights, hair textures, the magazine and the world . would be boring.' Seventeen's support: The magazine said it invited Miss Bluhm to its offices to meet with Ms Shoket after seeing her petition, called Seventeen Magazine: Give Girls Images Of Real Girls! The teenager originally uploaded the Seventeen magazine petition on the campaigning website change.org. Spread through social media, Miss Bluhm's petition gained around 6,000 signatures in ten days. With the help of a press release from a San Francisco PR firm, major news sites and blogs picked up the story and the number quickly grew to over 20,000. 'This is really exciting,' Miss . Bluhm told Jezebel in May. 'I now know that there are a lot of girls who feel . the same way as I do about this.' Miss Bluhm, who is also a regular . blogger for the 'girl-fueled' activist group Spark Summit, an organization that fights the sexualization of girls, wrote in . her petition that 'those pretty women that we see in magazines are . fake.' She continued: . 'They're often Photoshopped, airbrushed, edited to look thinner and to . appear like they have perfect skin. A girl you see in a magazine . probably looks a lot different in real life.' Editor's letter: In this month's issue, Ms Shoket acknowledged that the magazine will take steps to ensure models' are bodies are no longer altered . She also claimed that the constant use of airbrushing by the title has led to low self-esteem levels among her friends. The . petition read: 'Girls want to be accepted, appreciated and liked. And . when they don't fit the criteria, some girls like to fix themselves. This can lead to eating disorders, dieting, depression and low . self-esteem.' Miss . Bluhm, who is also enrolled in ballet classes at her middle school, . recalled some of the comments she hears at school, in the petition. They include 'It's a fat day' and 'I ate well today but I still feel fat.' The . outspoken teenager also targeted the media, claiming that it 'tells us . that pretty girls are impossibly thin with perfect skin.' While . such criticism is often voiced and discussed among adults, the words . are less commonly heard through children or teenagers. The news comes after Vogue's new health initiative, which was announced at the beginning of May. Condé Nast International and the editors . of Vogue’s 19 international editions agreed to 'encourage a healthier . approach to body image within the industry'.","A petition started in April by 14-year-old Julia Bluhm gained 84,000 signatures .

The Moroccan belly dancer at the centre of Silvio Berlusconi's sex trial told friends he was ready to pay millions for her silence, according to wiretaps published today. Karima El Mahroug, aka Ruby the Heartbreaker, said the former Italian Prime Minister was 'crazy for me' and promised to 'cover her in gold' if she kept their 'friendship' quiet. She also revealed, in conversations recorded by investigators in October 2010, he was paying her €47,000 each week and she had demanded €5million to ensure her silence. Scroll down to listen to the recordings . Wiretaps: Conversations between Karima El Mahroug (left) and her friends reveal Silvio Berlusconi (right) was paying her €47,000 per week . Claims: Karima El Mahroug, aka Ruby the Heartbreaker, said the former Italian Prime Minister was 'crazy for me' and promised to 'cover her in gold' if she kept their 'friendship' quiet . The wiretaps contain no substantial new revelations about the lurid 'bunga bunga' scandal which overshadowed Berlusconi's final months in office. But they reinforce allegations that he made frantic efforts to quell news about his relationship with Ruby. The Rubygate affair is the most spectacular of the many sexual scandals surrounding Berlusconi and is particularly dangerous for him. This is because it centres on the allegation he had paid El Mahroug for sex while she was still a minor - a criminal offence. He is also accused of using his office to have her released from police custody after she was accused of theft in an unrelated case. Both he and Mahroug deny they had sex and Berlusconi denies ever paying for sex with anybody. Belle of the ball: Ruby made an appearance at Vienna Opera Ball in 2011 . More famous faces: Veteran actor Larry Hagman, aka Dallas' JR Ewing, was also among invited guests at last year's high-society ball . In other tapes, Ruby tells friends that Berlusconi told her to 'act crazy' and in one, says she and her lawyer had asked for €5million to ensure her silence. Audio of the conversations were made available on the website of the daily La Repubblica newspaper. Since the opening of his trial in Milan a year ago, a number of young women have described striptease 'bunga bunga' parties at Berlusconi's luxury villa outside Milan. He has long insisted they were no more than elegant, convivial dinner parties. But speaking last week during his first appearance at the trial, Berlusconi said the young women took part in 'burlesque games'. He said he made payments to help a number of young women whose reputations had been ruined by the sex scandal. In the taped conversations published today, El Mahroug and her friends appear amused at the agitation her antics were causing at the Italian prime minister's office. Money maker: Audio of the conversations were made available for the first time today . 'Mamma mia! What have you gone and done now?' one asks with a laugh. 'I told you I knew Silvio...What's coming out is me being Silvio's lover,' Ruby is heard telling the friend, identified as Antonella. 'He called me yesterday and said I'll give you all the money you want, I'll pay you, I'll cover you in gold but the important thing is that you hide everything and don't tell anyone anything,' she said. Asked what she means by knowing Berlusconi, she replies: 'That I go to his house, that we've been friends for a year. It's just that people think the worst straight away. 'They see a beautiful girl who goes to Silvio's house, that he throws money at her - because he gave me €47,000 every week. Payments: Ruby said she was paid €47,000 per week and demanded €5million for her silence . 'They say 'Why does he do that for her? because he'd certainly have got something out of it, he'd have had sex'. It's not like that.' Asked by a friend whether she was afraid following the explosion of media interest in the story, she said: 'No I'm not afraid of anything. I'll have a lot of money, I'll be famous. What should I be afraid of?' Berlusconi, undermined by sex and corruption scandals, was forced from office last November and replaced by technocrat Prime Minister Mario Monti after Italy risked being plunged into a Greek-style debt crisis. He says left-wing magistrates have waged a campaign for decades to drive him from power and subvert democracy.","Taps reveal former Italian PM paid Ruby the Heartbreaker  €47,000 per week .

"Damien Noonan, 25 and two accomplices were jailed for kidnap, causing grievous bodily harm and conspiracy to supply drugs . His family is famous for appearing in At Home With The Noonans on the Crime & Investigation Network . By . Sara Malm . PUBLISHED: . 11:50 EST, 14 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:08 EST, 15 May 2012 . Wannabe gang boss: Damien Noonan, 25, was warned that 'celebrity status' wouldn't keep him out of prison . A “celebrity” crime family who have become reality TV stars have been warned they will never be untouchable - after one of them began almost seven years in jail. Damien Noonan, 25, was arrested after he plotted to flood the streets with a banned dance drug and arranged the brutal abduction and torture of a man. He had believed he could get away with his crimes after his crimelord uncle Domenyk, 46, agreed to star in a fly-on-the-wall TV documentary made by broadcaster Donal MacIntyre about his life as the head of one of the UK’s most notorious crime families. Damien Noonan Jnr. was jailed at Preston Crown Court for six years and nine months for kidnap, causing grievous bodily harm and conspiracy to supply drugs - as TV’s Crime and Investigation continued to screen their At Home With The Noonans. Two other men from his crime mob, Dwayne Devaney and Forbes Edwards, both 23 were also sentenced to six years and nine months each. Today Detective Chief Inspector Rick Jackson from Greater Manchester Police’s Serious Organised Crime Group said: 'This case clearly illustrates that irrespective of who you are or think you are, we are determined to catch up with you and make you face the consequences of your actions. Damian Noonan's 'crimelord' uncle Domenyk Noonan at the funeral of his brother Desmond in 2006 . 'These offenders were witnessed attacking and kidnapping a lone individual in what was a cowardly attack. The sentences received reflect the significant menace they posed to the community. 'They ruined lives by striking fear and intimidation within their local community to feed their egos and it is for that reason that these are exactly the types of individuals we will continue to tirelessly target. 'We will bring all the necessary resources to bear on those that ruin the quality of life for others.' Mr Noonan and and two other masked thugs had abducted 29-year old Steve Barton in the street in Chorley, Lancs, in October last year as children played nearby, then bundled him into a Nissan Qashqai car and bound him with tape. Witnesses said the masked men punched, kicked and stamped on their target and given a 'severe beating' until he passed out before dragging him into the car. During the victim’s hour long ordeal, the gangsters threatened to shoot him in the knees and burn his fingers off with a blowtorch. But when armed police stopped the kidnappers’ vehicle in a pub car park in Whitefield, Manchester and drew their guns, Noonan fainted. Behind bars: Forbes Edwards (L) and Dwayne Devaney (R) were also jailed alongside Noonan . A cosh and meat cleaver were found in the thugs’ car. Preston Crown Court was told Noonan carried out the kidnap for a friend who was a love rival of Barton. Barton received treatment for his injuries in hospital which were consistent with a severe beating. Jacob Dyer, prosecuting, said: ,During the man’s incarceration one voice said they would blow his kneecaps off another said: ""don’t forget the blowtorch we’ll burn his fingers off"" 'Armed police acting on a tip off stopped them soon after. The officers were forced to smash the car windows and throw CS gas canisters inside to detain the men and rescue their victim who had been almost stripped naked during the struggle.' The kidnap occurred whilst Noonan was on bail after he was caught arranging for 890 grams of methcathinone, smuggled into the country from China, to be sold to a gang. Officers from the Serious Organised Crime Agency had the conspirators under surveillance and seized the consignment, worth around £18,000 on the street, after a handover. Noonan had previous convictions for violence including affray and common assault. After the case Detective Superintendent Neil Hunter from Lancashire Police’s Force Major Investigation Team said: 'The motive for this heinous offence is still unclear as the defendants elected to maintain their right to silence when questioned. Donal MacIntyre at the funeral of Desmond Noonan in 2006. He followed the notorious crime family for the fly-on-the-wall documentary At home With The Noonans . 'But it is important to stress that kidnaps of this nature are extremely rare in fact even rarer than homicide. 'The shocking nature of this offence was that it was committed in broad daylight in full view of young children playing out and on a very nice housing estate in Chorley. 'This was a particularly vicious assault carried out by a ruthless organised crime group. 'The hostage, Steven Barton, was chased over parked vehicles and through gardens until he was eventually caught. 'He was viciously assaulted and dragged screaming into the car where he was stripped naked, bound and gagged and forced into the boot of the vehicle before being driven away from the area. 'This was an excellent of cross . border cooperation between Lancashire Constabulary and Greater . Manchester Police and I cannot praise them highly enough as when the . stolen car was stopped by police the hostage was found naked in the . vehicle, still restrained by the ankles and legs, gagged with a broken . jaw and other injuries. 'Mr . Barton was extremely fortunate as I’ve no doubt that without the police . intervention his injuries would have been far more serious, if not . fatal.' Desmond ""Dessie"" Noonan was the 'political fixer' for the Noonan family and was stabbed to death in 2005 . Domenyk Noonan has more than 40 convictions for a wide range of offences including armed robbery, police assault, possession of firearms, prison escape and fraud and has spent 22 years in prisons across Britain. He and his late brother Desmond were the subject of a 2006 documentary A Very British Gangster directed by MacIntyre. The latest documentary series features interviews with Noonan from behind bars. He had been freed last year halfway through a nine and a half year prison sentence after a gun was found under the bonnet of his Jaguar car - but he was recalled to prison on a number of occasions for breaching the terms of his early release. His parole board hearing, which had been due to take place earlier this month, has been delayed indefinitely. It is understood Noonan, who changed his name to Lattlay-Fottfoy, was filmed for the series while he was out of jail and he also spoke to the documentary makers on the phone when inside.","Damien Noonan, 25 and two accomplices were jailed for kidnap, causing grievous bodily harm and conspiracy to supply drugs .

"Jury deliberates whether missing woman's father-in-law Steven Powell filmed girls, 8 and 10 . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:24 EST, 15 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 21:49 EST, 15 May 2012 . The Powell family have released never-seen-before home video to fight the opinion that Susan Cox-Powell was frightened of her father-in-law Steven Powell before she went missing in 2009. The website was unveiled by Steven Powell's daughter Alina and shows Susan and her husband Joshua spending time with their young sons Charlie and Braden. It came as the jury began deliberating this morning in Tacoma, Washington over the trial of Steven Powell who is accused of 14 counts of voyeurism - including charges that he  filmed and photographed two girls, aged eight and ten, as they used the bathroom in the home behind his home in 2006. Happy family: Steven Powell show in home video footage with his daughter-in-law Susan Powell and two grandsons Charlie and Braden . Day trip: Susan Powell swings with her two young sons at a park while her father-in-law looks on . They had not reached a decision by the end of Tuesday. Powell faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on each of 14 counts against him. If convicted of all counts, he could face up to 70 years in prison. A jury of 12 men and women and two alternates were finally selected out of 70, who had to answer questions about whether or not they were biased or had formed an opinion on the high-profile case. Powell, 62, is the father-in-law of Susan Powell, who disappeared from her home in West Valley City, Utah, in late 2009. The new website, West Valley and Pierce County Malfeasance, featured tapes of the Powell family and 'Grandpa Steve' visiting a dam, playing at a park, walking on the beach and making dinner together. Lost innocence: Charlie and Braden were both killed in February by their father after he set an explosion at his Washington home . Togetherness: The family of Steven Powell, who is standing trial on voyeurism charges, released the unseen footage to show the world that Susan Powell was not afraid for herself or her sons to be around her father-in-law . One video is addressed to Susan Powell's parents Chuck and Judy Cox, another to Jennifer Graves, an estranged sister of the Powell family, and later a friend of Susan Powell's Kiirsi Hellewell who told various TV stations how much Mrs Powell did not like her father-in-law. The site stated: 'If Susan had really thought that Steve Powell were a danger to her children, as the police are trying to claim, there's no way she would have allowed him access to her children in so carefree a manner as demonstrated in the videos. 'Susan was a caring mother and an excellent judge of character. The police have misrepresented Susan's writings in bad faith.' Publishing the site was aimed at giving the Powell family's side in the ongoing feud with Susan's family who believe her husband and father-in-law had something to do with her disappearance. Strain: Steven Powell appears at court in Tacoma, Washington yesterday where he faces up to 70 years in prison for allegedly filming girls aged eight and ten from his home . For the past two years, Joshua Powell had been the only true person-of-interest in the case. He claimed he took his young sons, then four and two, camping on the freezing winter night around 12.30am back in 2009. He said he believed his wife ran off with another man. Authorities searched the desert for twelve days in the area where Josh Powell said he went camping that night. At one point, they said they found a 'shallow grave' after cadaver dogs alerted them to the spot. But they found no human remains. In February, Susan's husband Josh Powell, attacked Braden, seven, and Charlie, five with a hatchet and ignited an explosive fire in which he and the boys died at his Washington home. Destroyed: Susan Powell disappeared in 2009 and her husband Joshua was the sole person-of-interest. The father took his own life and that of his sons earlier this year . Cozy: The grandfather is seen serving up food for his grandson while daughter-in-law Susan looks on. Her family have accused Powell of knowing more about her disappearance than he says . Among the images recovered from Steve Powell's home were many of Susan Powell that appeared to have been filmed without her knowledge, investigators said. There were also journals in which Steve Powell detailed his obsession with Susan Powell, they said. Much of that evidence has been barred from the trial as unduly prejudicial against the defendant. Steve Powell was not charged with acts of voyeurism involving Susan Powell because authorities can't prove she didn't know about the filming. Susan Powell's father, Chuck Cox, said it was obvious that the images of Susan were recorded without her permission. 'Clearly their strongest evidence on anything is on Susan being a victim,' Cox said. 'I don't get it. Does she not count?'","Jury deliberates whether missing woman's father-in-law Steven Powell filmed girls, 8 and 10 .

A cheat who pretended he needed to use a wheelchair so he could claim benefits has been jailed after investigators caught working as a window cleaner. Thomas Kenny claimed more than £33,000 in incapacity benefit and disability living allowance over a five-year period. The 52-year-old - who had been jailed back in 2009 for a different case of benefit fraud - was emotionless as he was sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court to eight months in prison. The father-of-two was caught on surveillance by the Department for Work and Pensions carrying a ladder and taking a tyre out of the boot of his car. Grey-haired Kenny was charged with failing to notify the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) of a change in circumstances when he started work as a window cleaner in 2007, having claimed incapacity benefits since 1997 for a bad back. He was also charged with fraudulently claiming Disability Living Allowance (DLA) from April 2008 until his arrest last September. He pleaded guilty to both charges at Liverpool Magistrates Court in March. The 'serial fraudster' claimed £11,554.30 of DLA from April 2008 until September 2011. He also fraudulently claimed £22,129.50 of incapacity benefits from June 2007 to August 2011. He fraudulently claimed a total of £33,683.80. Bootle-born Kenny claimed on his DLA application form that he used a walking stick, and sometimes used a wheelchair. He also claimed that he could not wash or dry himself, needed help climbing the stairs, and that it took him three to four minutes to walk five metres, but had been working as a window cleaner since 2007. Kenny claimed he only took on the window cleaning work from his father, who had suffered a fall in 2007 which resulted in a brain injury. An earlier sentencing date was adjourned last month as Kenny’s father died while he was in court. Nicola Daley, prosecuting, said: 'He (Kenny) has been in receipt of incapacity benefits since 1997 and was unfit for work. 'It was not fraudulent from the outset, but there was a failure to notify the DWP of the change in circumstances. 'In more recent times he was working as a self-employed window cleaner.' Kenny was also jailed for four months in 2009 for failing to notify the DWP of his wife’s occupational pension, after claiming income support for the couple since 2002. Under surveillance: Thomas Kenny claimed his back complaint was a disability... but was caught on camera lifting a ladder . Heavy load: In one image, Kenny is seen lifting a tyre from the boot of his car . Only a quarter of that sentence was served, and it did not deter Kenny, who continued to receive DLA and incapacity benefits following his release. David Birrell, defending, said: 'By explanation and not excuse, the window cleaning round Mr Kenny carried out had been his father’s round. 'His father suffered an accident when he fell from a ladder in 2007 and suffered what would end up as a fatal brain injury. 'Mr Kenny was asked to step in by his mother and he said he felt obliged to do so. He is 52, married, with two children. His daughter sits in court today, and his family are devastated. 'He is a man who works and volunteers driving disabled children around - there is good in him.' Judge Mark Brown, sentencing, said: 'Mr Kenny, you said it took you several minutes to walk a short distance and needed a walking stick and needed help with personal issues. Exposed: Kenny is captured on camera by investigators working as a window cleaner . Easy does it: Far from being incapacitated, Kenny lifts the ladder on to the roof of his car with ease . 'There was significant dishonesty here and your position is considerably aggravated by the fact that in 2009 you were sentenced to four months in prison for making false statements to obtain benefits over the course of five-and-a-half years. 'Following your release from prison, you continued to claim incapacity benefits and DLA and did so fraudulently. 'It is clear to me that you are something of a serial fraudster. You are a repeat offender when it comes to duping the state. 'It has been said time and time again that this country cannot afford to pay out these kind of monies. 'Money that could be put into health care and social services. It could be used to support people, not put into your back pocket.' Kenny was sentenced to eight months in prison, and waved to his daughter, who burst into tears as he was led from the dock.","Thomas Kenny claimed his back complaint was so bad he couldn't walk .

The picture of an origami heron holding a goldfish in its beak sprang up overnight in Lyme Regis, Dorset, on a wall next to the River Lym. Although he eschewed the typically gritty urban settings for this artwork, it bore all the hallmarks of the mysterious artist and its authenticity was confirmed when he posted it his website.

Quiet countryside setting: Unlike usual graffiti, Banksy's work has been known to cause the values of nearby property to skyrocket . It is the second new Banksy piece to have appeared this month, after another was painted on the wall of a Poundland shop in Haringey, north London. That rather more political piece showed a young boy hunched over a sewing machine with real Union Flag bunting attached - a dark reflection on the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Someone later removed the bunting, which was similar to a kind sold in the nearby discount shop. In the past, graffiti by the elusive artist has the values of nearby property to skyrocket. In 2008, a Portobello Road wall adorned with his name fetched £200,000 on eBay. Sharp political message: This image of a boy slaving over a sewing machine with bunting attached appeared next to a Poundland shop in north London just in time for the Jubilee .

But residents have become alarmed at some far from family-friendly activity on their tree-lined avenue – NHS workers cavorting in their cars. Police have been called repeatedly after nurses, hospital technicians, support workers and cleaners were seen indulging in lewd behaviour. Controversy: Residents claim staff leave vehicles in their roads to avoid paying for parking at Darent Valley Hospital (pictured) The incidents, on Powell Avenue, in Dartford, Kent, usually take place during meal and shift breaks at Darent Valley Hospital, just three minutes' walk away. Now police have stepped up their patrols in an effort to stamp out the behaviour. The problem has been linked to a reduction of parking spaces at the hospital. Staff started parking on Powell Avenue to avoid paying for a space. Mother-of-one Kelly Purvor, 29, said she was 'disgusted' after seeing NHS staff engaged in a 'sex act' in a car parked outside her home. She called the police, who traced the driver and quizzed him, but ended up taking no action due to lack of evidence. 'They really need to wait until they get home': Residents say they have been forced to call police after catching couples in the act (file photo) Miss Purvor said: 'We are trying to raise young children and we don't want to explain to them what is happening in these cars.' Neighbour Colin Pearson, 34, said he spotted two hospital workers – one man wearing an NHS tabard or apron and a female nurse – in a car on the road. He said they spent around an hour in the car and that it did not take much imagination to guess what was going on. He said: 'They really need to wait until they get home.' Neighbours have given some of the staff nicknames. 'Mr VW', for example, and a mystery woman, both dressed in nurse uniforms, were spotted in his Polo. Miss Purvor said: 'They said they were just eating their lunch. But I know what I saw.' Kent Police confirmed that the neighbourhood police team was 'monitoring' the area. A spokesman for the 478-bed hospital refused to comment, but Susan Acott, the chief executive of Dartford and Gravesham NHS Trust, said: 'I am sorry to hear about the difficulties caused by the cars in Powell Avenue.'","Residents claim couples were still wearing their NHS uniforms and ID badges .

'We just held her. That's all we did,' she said. The new mother savored the few precious moments she had with her fragile daughter, who didn’t even open her eyes. Kaylee died within minutes and Sherman was forced to leave the hospital with no baby. Adding to her pain, Sherman was billed, not only for her own care, but for that of her dead baby, who she said received no medical attention.

A Premier League academy footballer is today being held over the killing of his 15-year-old girlfriend who was knifed to death at a house party. Stoke City midfielder Andrew Hall, 18, was arrested after Megan-Leigh Peat was attacked at the gathering in the early hours of Saturday. The young footballer has not yet been questioned by detectives as he is being treated for a partially severed finger. Arrest: Andrew Hall, 18, who plays for Stoke City's under 18 team, is being held over the killing of Megan-Leigh Peat, 15, right, who was stabbed to death at a house party in Ampthill, Bedfordshire . It is believed Megan, who wanted to train as a midwife, had been in an on-off relationship with the suspect. Megan's father David, 39, laid a floral tribute to his daughter at the scene of the murder in Ampthill, Bedfordshire, yesterday. A card attached to it said: 'Megan . Moosay, miss you more than words can say. You will always be in my . thoughts and forever in my heart. Love you forever, Dad.' Megan’s devastated father and her mother Nicola, also aged 39, faced the grim prospect today of viewing the schoolgirl’s body. At the family home, where Megan lived . with her mother, brother and her mother's partner, a relative said: . 'Megan’s mum and dad are going to see her in hospital today. 'It’s been pretty full on recently. They are just not ready to talk about what happened. It’s still just so soon.' Megan wanted to train as a midwife and had been in an on-off relationship with the suspect . At the family’s red-brick home, tucked . away behind hedges, in Westoning, Bedfordshire, a window box had been . placed outside and was today filled with bunches of flowers laid in her . memory. Friends and relatives also turned the . front garden of the semi-detached home where she was killed into a . memorial to her life, with touching handwritten messages, lanterns and . floral tributes. Rumours spread among friends who . arrived with flowers yesterday that the arrested man was Megan’s . boyfriend, named locally as Andrew Hall. Hall plays for the Stoke City . under-18s team. He scored a crucial goal earlier this year to send his . team through to the fourth round of the FA Youth Cup. A spokesman for the club told The Sun: . 'the club are not prepared to comment at this stage other than to say . that the thoughts of everyone here are with Megan's family at this . tragic time.' Some of the teenagers who attended the . party on Friday night and Saturday morning had been seen reportedly smoking . cannabis in the cellar bar of a nearby pub in the hours before the . attack. It is believed Megan had gone to the house with at least one friend and may have been joined by others later. Paramedics went to the house at 1.30am . after calls saying a girl had been fatally injured. Despite attempts to . revive her, she died at the scene. Police arrested the suspect in a nearby street shortly after the stabbing. A trail of blood ran from the house and a neighbour's Vauxhall Astra had blood spattered on the tyres.

An Iowa mom helplessly watched as the speedometer on her Kia Sorento surged forward due to a stuck accelerator, and she was left to hold on for dear life. The mechanical malfunction on Sunday sent Lauri Ulvestad on a fast and furious, 59 mile journey down a Missouri highway in 35 minutes. Scroll down for video. Terrifying speed: Lauri Ulvestad (in the black SUV on the left) frantically tried to avoid other vehicles as she maneuvered her speeding SUV down Interstate 35 . Squeezing by: The driver had to move into the road's shoulder under this bridge to avoid a collision . The driver somehow managed to maneuver her unstoppable SUV by weaving in . and out of traffic, swerving to avoid cars and barreling through a . construction zone, in footage captured by state troopers. Luckily, no injuries resulted from the fast-moving ride north on Interstate 35. 'I knew I was going to die,' Ulvestad, 47, told KCCI-TV. 'I didn't have any doubt about. I really thought I was going to die... and no matter what I did, I couldn't slow it down.' Unstoppable: Footage from Missouri State Troopers show Iowa driver Lauri Ulvestad swerving into the median to avoid hitting cars . Close call: The driver narrowly missed veering into a construction zone as she tries to steer clear of a sedan . Though her foot was not even on the accelerator, the rapid moving . car continued on and the brakes had no power to bring the vehicle to a . halt. The freakish malfunction occurred when Ulvestad was returning . to her home in Ames, Iowa after a weekend with friends in Kansas City, . Missouri. After she stopped for gas and returned to the road, near Bethanny, Missouri, she noticed her car speeding up. And then the out-of-control Sorento took off. Clear the road: Missouri State Troopers used sirens to try and clear the road for the speeding SUV . Half hour of hell: Lauri Ulvestad sped from Bethanny, Missouri to Osceola, Iowa, a 59 mile journey, in 35 minutes . Ulvestad was able to call 911 and state troopers with blaring sirens came to her aid to move traffic out of the way. A . 911 operator stayed on the phone with her during the petrifying ordeal . and passed on advice on how to get the vehicle stopped. But despite their best efforts, after a half hour nothing worked. 'I had a little angel that said, 'Don't drive faster than I can . fly,'' Ulvestad told the local news station, choking up just thinking . about those harrowing 30-minutes behind the wheel. 'And I think that's what helped me.' Finally, the troopers suggested she try and lift up the accelerator and push on the brake at the same time. Relief: The 47-year-old (in red sweater) fell into the arms of an officer when her car finally started to slow down . Take it: A Missouri State Trooper prepares to get behind the wheel and get the vehicle to a complete stop . 'I did that, and it slammed me from 119 mph to like nothing. It . slowed down enough that I jumped out, and [the car] kept going and then . the officers went and tracked it down and unhooked the battery,' she . said. Footage shows Ulvestad jumping out of her vehicle and falling into the arms of an officer, overwhelmed with relief and emotion. 'I went and hugged him and said, 'I'm safe, I'm safe, I'm safe, I'm safe -- Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!'' Grateful: After the frightening ordeal Lauri Ulvestad thanked her guardian angel and the 911 operator who stayed on the line with her during the ride . After the Sunday incident, Kia Motors looked at Ulvestad's car and issued . a statement saying they cannot identify what caused the accelerator to . stick. 'Our technicians have been unable to duplicate the issue and this appears to be an isolated incident. KMA will continue to investigate and analyze the facts of this situation and will work with the customer to resolve the matter in a timely manner,' the company said. Investigation: Kia Motors is looking into what could have caused the malfunction but still has no answers. The South Korean automaker began producing the Sorento (pictured) in 2002 . In the meantime, Kia has provided Ulvestad with alternative transportation as they study her vehicle. The Sorento is a mid-size crossover SUV (or CUV) that has been produced since 2002 by the South Korean based automaker. The Sorento is assembled at Kia’s first U.S. factory, located in West Point, Georgia. Recent feedback on the vehicle has been positive, with one reviewer on Edmunds.com praising the Sorento for being 'smooth and quiet, the handling is secure and the driving position puts you at a commanding height.'","Kia Sorento sped from 70 mph to 120 mph in a matter of minutes .

Gone may soon be the days when litres of unpleasant liquid laxatives are the unwelcoming first step before a virtual colonoscopy, and researchers hope colorectal cancer too. Researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona have unveiled four small pills they say have the same bowel-cleansing effect of the previously prescribed self-cleansing liquid required before the cancer screening. The unpleasant process of drinking several litres of the liquid laxatives has been linked to patients delaying or skipping the cancer's recommending screening all together, according to the doctors. Scroll down for video . Revelation: Researchers have unveiled a new pill shown where four taken have the same bowel-cleansing effect of previously prescribed liquid laxatives needed for colonoscopies . That effect has added to colorectal cancer being the second leading cause of cancer deaths among Americans, the Mayo Clinic reports. 'Some become so anxious about drinking so much liquid that they avoid the entire procedure, putting them at risk of undiagnosed cancer,' the clinic states. But now with the four tiny pills, pictured the size of a round aspirin, there's another option which they say provides the same results of standard liquid laxatives. The catch is: They are only effective for virtual colonoscopies - the first screenings undergone by patients for potentially cancerous polyps. Outdating: Patients previously had to drink several littres of a liquid, pictured, found unpleasant to most before completing a virtual colonoscopy . For 88 per cent of colonoscopy patients, however, it's the only one required the Mayo Clinic says. The exception, or the 12 per cent, would be the cases that they find something requiring a standard colonoscopy. 'Our hope is that this will make people less anxious and more likely to get screened and will ultimately result in fewer deaths from colorectal cancer,' said C. Daniel Johnson, M.D., chair of the Department of Radiology at Arizona's Mayo Clinic in a release. Doctors at the Mayo Clinic, which was the first to offer the screenings for routine care, recommend regular screenings for people over the age of 50 but admit that most do not. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be 103,170 new cases of colon cancer this year, with 40,290 new cases of rectal cancer. The lifetime risk of a person developing colorectal cancer is approximated at 1 in 20. New treatment over the years has resulted in more than 1 million survivors of the cancer in the U.S. alone.

Google Chief Executive Larry Page has reassured employees about his health, but the company on Friday shed little additional light on an unspecified condition affecting his voice that will side-line him from two high-profile events in the coming weeks. Page told employees in an email on Thursday that there was 'nothing seriously wrong with me,' according to a source who had seen an internal staff memo. The 39-year-old Google co-founder sat out his company's annual shareholders' meeting on Thursday because he had 'lost his voice,' according to Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, who informed attendees of the news at the start of the event. The condition will also cause Page to miss Google's annual developer conference next week as well as its quarterly results announcement next month. Page continues to run Google's business, but has been asked to rest his voice, according to a Google spokeswoman. The company declined further comment on his condition. The prolonged absence from the public spotlight raises questions about his condition, and the company's obligation to disclose issues of concern to shareholders. Seen recently: Page spoke during a news conference at the Google offices on May 21, 2012 in New York . Sick leave: The 39-year-old Google co-founder sat out his company's annual shareholders' meeting on Thursday because he had 'lost his voice,' according to Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt . Corporate governance experts say Google has met minimal disclosure requirements but will face increasing pressure while Page remains out of sight. On Friday, Google's shares rose 1.1 per cent to $571.48, lifted along with the rest of the Nasdaq. 'It gets them over the first disclosure hurdle, that is they've alerted shareholders to the fact he's going to have this health effect,' said James Post, a professor of management at Boston University who specializes in corporate governance issues. 'The tough questions still lie ahead, and there will be continued pressure to keep answering those tough questions.' While many people, including senior business executives, prefer to keep health matters private, public company CEOs have responsibilities to a 'wide set of constituents, some of whom have a legitimate claim to know about material information,' said Post. Honesty: Apple Inc was criticized for being less than forthright about the health of CEO Steve Jobs, who died in October after a long struggle with pancreatic cancer . The issue came to the fore several years ago when Apple Inc was criticized for being less than forthright about the health of CEO Steve Jobs, who died in October after a long struggle with pancreatic cancer. NAME: Larry Page . AGE: 39 . EDUCATION: Bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan, master's degree from Stanford University, on leave from Ph.D. program at Stanford. PERSONAL: Married to Lucy Southworth. PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE: Took over as Google Inc.'s CEO in April 2011, having left the post in 2001 to become Google's president of products. Co-founded Google in 1998 with Sergey Brin and served as founding CEO. NET WORTH: $19 billion, according to Forbes magazine. Source: AP . 'With the concerns over Steve Jobs, people are quick to jump to a conclusion that may not be the right conclusion to jump to,' said Needham & company analyst Kerry Rice. Page's health could be regarded as an especially significant issue because he, along with Schmidt and co-founder Sergey Brin, have majority control of the Internet company through special voting shares. Wall Street analysts mostly took the news of Page's extended absence in stride, though some expressed concern about the lack of information. 'It's the number one thing I'm concerned about today just because there's so little data available,' said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis. JP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth noted that Page has not posted any messages to his Google+ profile since May 25. 'We have no specific reason to think there is anything more to Larry's condition, but we find it odd that the company would already rule him out of the 2Q call, which is likely still a few weeks away,' Anmuth wrote to clients late on Thursday. 'This could raise some questions among investors.' Simon Best, a head and neck surgery specialist at the Johns Hopkins Voice Center, said most cases where a doctor might order a patient to rest their voice involved either a vocal cord haemorrhage, or throat surgery of some sort. 'We actually very rarely put people on complete voice rest where they are not cleared to talk or allowed to talk,' West said. 'There are probably some practice differences between physicians and whoever is treating him, but there are only two scenarios where we put people on voice rest: if they've had vocal cord surgery, or if they've had a vocal cord haemorrhage.' Best, who has not treated Page, said haemorrhages were easily treatable, but a wide variety of conditions might necessitate surgery. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the details of Page's internal memo on Friday. During the shareholder meeting on Thursday, Google's Schmidt tried to lighten the situation by relaying comments that co-founder Brin had made about Page's condition: Sergey 'has said that this problem will make Larry a better CEO because he's going to have to choose his words very carefully.'","Google CEO Larry Page told employees in an email Thursday there was 'nothing seriously wrong with me' after missing annual meeting .

Rielle Hunter, the mistress who derailed John Edwards' political career, says she was not the only lover the two-time presidential candidate had outside his marriage. In her explosive new book about her affair with Edwards and the child she had with him, Hunter claims the North Carolina Democrat had two other mistresses while he was with his wife Elizabeth. But, Edwards lied when he first met Hunter, she says, and told her had even more lovers. Hunter seems to excuse Edwards' attacks on the people around him, especially his cancer-stricken wife Elizabeth, whom she called a 'witch on wheels.' Tell-all: In an interview with ABC News, scheduled to air on Friday, Rielle Hunter describes her life as a political mistress . Together: John Edwards in pictured in New Orleans in this December 2006 photo with Rielle Hunter, who worked as a videographer for the campaign . Under siege: Elizabeth Edwards, pictured here three months before she died of cancer, is called abusive and 'venomous' by Hunter . ABC News reports Hunter claims that Edwards never told her the truth about his affairs until last year, two years after she testified under oath to a grand jury. Hunter's book, 'What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me,' is a tell-all about the life of a political mistress. She describes waiting for hours at hotel bars for her lover to swoop in off the campaign trail. They often shared hurried dinners over take-out before short, passionate romps. Then, Edwards had to leave and return to his cancer-stricken wife and his life in the public eye. Her 'What Really Happened' is due out June 26. An extensive interview with ABC News will air Friday on '20/20.' The book contains a full-throated defense of her lover -- even as she is coy about the status of their relationship. Hunter attacks Elizabeth Edwards, who died in December 2010 of breast cancer, calling her 'crazy,' 'venomous' and a 'witch on wheels.' She says her abusive behavior toward John Edwards drove him into the arms of other women. Other accounts of the 2008 presidential campaign, including 'Game Change' by journalists John Heilemann and Mark Halperin back up Hunter's portrait of Elizabeth Edwards as controlling and potentially abusive. He also blasts Andrew Young, John Edwards top aide, who helped hide the affair for several years. She says it was Young's idea for Edwards and Hunter and lie and say Hunter's baby, Quinn, belonged to him and not the presidential candidate. Hunter repeated the lie in an interview with the National Enquirer and Edwards, famously, told ABC News during an August 2008 broadcast that the baby was not his. The pair met in February 2006 at a Charlotte hotel when Hunter approached Edwards, who had just given up his US Senate seat, and told him 'You are so hot.' He called her over minutes later and invited her up to his hotel room. Shot at redemption: After his acquittal on campaign finance violations last month, John Edwards pledged to rebuild his public image . Speaking up: Rielle Hunter, with her daughter Quinn, speaks to Chris Cuomo for 20/20 . After they slept together, she says, he lied and told her he was also involved with three other women in Chicago, Los Angeles and Florida. For five years, he controlled Hunter's emotions with tales of his trysts with other women. She says he lied about the additional affairs to keep her from getting 'too attached.' In fact, she says, Edwards admitted in 2011 that he had two previous affairs, but both ended before he had met her. 'My reality in our relationship had been ripped out from under me,' she writes. However, Hunter ends up justifying Edwards' decision to lie to her, and to the country. 'Johnny didn't do anything out of character. He has a long history of lying about one thing only -- women -- and I mistakenly thought I was different,' she writes. When Edwards faced the prospect of an indictment that could put him behind bars, he calmly told Hunter he would probably wind up in a low-security prison in Virginia more like a country club than a jail. She quickly responded that she and their daughter would move there to be near him if that happened. The book also included 48-year-old Hunter's mixed views on Edwards' parenting of their daughter Quinn and descriptions of his wife Elizabeth's outbursts. Hunter was pictured for the first time being interviewed on camera for 20/20, sitting with her daughter Quinn in her lap. Disgraced: Former senator John Edwards was acquitted on one count of accepting illegal campaign funds and a mistrial was declared on the five other counts . At the end of the book, Hunter says she still has romantic feelings for Edwards but doesn't know how their relationship will turn out. The book also provides a window into Edwards' psyche as federal prosecutors began their case against him. Days before his indictment Hunter asked: 'So if you went to jail, what kind of jail would it be? One of those country clubs?' 'He said, ''Yeah.'"" 'Where?' she asked. 'Probably Virginia.' 'So Quinn and I will move to Virginia. Virginia is a great state.' The only low-security federal prison in Virginia is in Petersburg, where former Washington, D.C., mayor Marion Barry once served time. On the day of the indictment, the two shared a surreal phone call as a newspaper reporter banged on her door in Charlotte, while the man she refers to as 'Johnny' throughout the book called her cell phone to say that he was also being pursued. 'I've got helicopters circling my house,' Johnny said. In the public eye: Hunter's affair with John Edwards which resulted in their daughter Quinn, cost the former senator his bid for the White House . New York publishers had said they were not interested in Hunter's book, citing her negative image, so it is instead being released through a Dallas-based boutique publisher, BenBella Books, on June 26. Federal prosecutors spent a year prosecuting Edwards, culminating in a six-week trial that ended last month. Jurors acquitted Edwards on one count of accepting illegal campaign contributions and deadlocked on five other felony counts. The judge declared a mistrial. Federal prosecutors then said in a court order earlier this month that they wouldn't retry Edwards, and the charges against him were dropped. Neither Edwards nor Hunter testified. Prosecutors had accused Edwards, 59, of masterminding a scheme to use about $1 million in secret payments from two wealthy political donors to hide his pregnant mistress as he sought the White House in 2008. The trial publicized intimate details about Edwards' affair with Hunter as his wife, Elizabeth, was dying of cancer.

A father killed himself and his seven-year-old daughter in a pre-planned house fire intended to wipe out his entire family, an inquest heard today. Philip Braithwaite had been suffering from mental health problems and had racked up significant debts when he set the family home on fire last year, Teesside Coroner's Court heard. The 49-year-old had researched methods on the internet before hand and had left notes suggesting he meant to kill his wife Christine and two daughters in the May day blaze, the inquest was told. A picture of happiness: Jessica Braithwaite, left, pictured with her sister Catriona, right, before she died in a fire started by her father . His youngest daughter Jessica, died in hospital the following day while eldest daughter Catriona, now 10, who has cerebral palsy, suffered significant injuries. Mrs Braithwaite managed to escape the 'inferno' and raise the alarm. Investigations following the fire revealed Mr Braithwaite had disconnected the home’s smoke alarms and brought a petrol can into the family home,  just yards from the sea in Redcar, Teesside. In a statement read out in court Mrs Braithwaite said her husband began suffering mental health problems about nine months before the fire. She said: 'Up until July or August 2010 I would describe Philip as being a good husband and a wonderful father. He was a fantastic dad who really adored the children.' Problems: Philip Braithwaite had been suffering from mental health problems and had racked up debts when he set the family home on fire . The court heard that Mr Braithwaite had run his own health and safety consultancy firm Cotswold Safety Ltd. But after falling ill in 2010 he had struggled to cope and complained of money problems, including a £17,000 credit card bill. During his illness he made two suicide attempts, the inquest heard. He had been treated by mental health teams and at one point spent a six-week spell in hospital. On the night of the fire Mrs Braithwaite was watching television in a downstairs living room. Her husband started the blaze in another livingroom, used as the children’s play room. Catriona and Jessica were upstairs in different bedrooms at the time. Mrs Braithwaite said she became aware of the fire at about 11.30pm in a hallway. She said: 'As I walked out I was greeted by what I can only describe as an inferno. 'There was a wall of fire that appeared to reach the top of the door whichcompletely filled the doorway with thick, acrid, black smoke gushing out of the room which was choking me. 'I was hysterical, I shouted out ""what the hell have you done?"" I couldn’tunderstand how a fire could have got so big and intense so quickly. I rantowards the stairs and tried to go upstairs but was immediately choking on the smoke and couldn’t go up.' The distraught mother then grabbed her mobile phone, rang 999 and ran into the street shouting 'the kids are in there'. Neighbours frantically tried to help but couldn’t get past the flames. Tragic: Mr Braithwaite had researched methods on the internet before starting the fire at the family home in Redcar, Teesside on May day last year . Redcar MP Ian Swales described it as a 'shocking tragedy' and Councillor Bob Stanway, a neighbour, said it had devastated the whole street. Both father and daughter died as a result of smoke inhalation, pathologist Dr Nigel Cooper told the hearing. Assistant deputy coroner Clare Bailey recorded the verdicts that Mr Braithwaite killed himself and Jessica was unlawfully killed. Detective Sergeant Paul Husband, who was part of a four-month investigation into the incident, told the inquest Mr Braithwaite had researched his method online. He said: 'In order to do this, and building upon his existing professional knowledge, he researched the spread of house fire onthe internet.' The detective added: 'Notes written by Philip indicate that he intended to kill himself and his family and it seems probable that his actions werepremeditated, although he was suffering from mental illness at the time.'","Inquest told Philip Braithwaite, 49, had researched methods on the internet before starting fire .

Her devotion to her career and husband has ensured Zara Phillips a reputation as one of the more down-to-earth royals. But the hard-working ethos has not always been her approach to life, her father has admitted. Zara was 'a brat' when she was a child, Captain Mark Phillips has . revealed - although he readily admits he was not a great father to her . and her brother Peter. Crossing the line: Captain Mark Phillips, pictured with his daughter on her wedding day, said the sporty 31-year-old used to be rather disobedient . The Queen's granddaughter, 31, is now preparing to compete in the Olympic eventing team, but there was a time when was far less hard-working and well behaved. The ex-husband of the Princess Royal said he struggled when she was a small child, but tried to instil a sense of responsibility in her as she grew up and had the run of the family's country pile Gatcombe Park, in Gloucestershire. Zara's older brother Peter 'knew where the line was and he didn’t cross it', Captain Phillips told the Sunday Times magazine in an interview. 'Zara, on the other hand, who came along four years later, was much more difficult, much more of a brat. I don’t think she accepted that line at all.' The siblings were sent to boarding school but returned to the home of their father and Princess Anne in the holidays. 'They knew that to have freedom they had to earn it,' said Captain Phillips. 'They also didn’t want their father peering over their shoulder every time they went off and did something by themselves. 'They knew that if they were going to have a party here, they could have fun, but they also had to respect things. So if there was spilled wine on the carpet, or a broken vase on the table, they knew Father, for one, wasn’t going to be pleased.' Naughty little sister: Princess Anne and Mark Phillips with baby daughter Zara and son Peter . Now and then: Zara Phillips and husband Mike Tindall after her show jumping trials, left, and the Queen's granddaughter as a child, right . The captain later married second wife Sandy Pflueger, an American dressage rider, but recently reportedly left her for equestrian Lauren Hough, 35. He said his son was a 'great father' to his two daughters with Canadian wife Autumn Kelly. 'Peter has already proved to be a great father — a much better father than I ever was. I was never good with small children. Once Peter and Zara could walk and talk, and be useful, I could relate to them much more.' His son backed up this view, saying his father was not home as much as he would have liked to have been, largely because of his relentless work ethic. The 34-year-old added: 'Would I leave my children in the care of my father? Probably not, to put it bluntly. I think he’d possibly get distracted by something horse-related and wander off leaving them.' Captain Phillips is coaching the US eventing team for London 2012, so is not able to have much contact with Zara or lend her support during the competition. But he declared himself thrilled for his daughter and delighted she could 'tick the Olympics box' after ticking so many others.","The 31-year-old was more 'difficult' than her brother and 'crossed the line'

The gastronomic son of the Duchess of Cornwall made the controversial comments on ITV's This Morning - during a cooking segment in which he demonstrated how to make family-friendly fish cakes from sustainable cod and salmon - and tweeting vegans were not amused. Food for thought: Meat-eating Tom Parker Bowles upset tweeting vegans with his comments on ITV's This Morning that forcing a vegan diet upon young children was 'child abuse' While adding butter to his potato mix, Parker Bowles told presenters Philip .

'All . these ridiculous hippies who bang on and tell us that we shouldn't be . eating this, we should be eating vegan raw diets...for children, that's . child abuse, I think.'

"Mike Dowdall suffers morning sickness and sore nipples alongside his pregnant partner . Not medically recognised but often occurs with two very close partners . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 09:58 EST, 10 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:45 EST, 11 September 2012 . From strange cravings and morning sickness to painful contractions, pregnancy is no fun experience and women need the full support of their husbands. But for one woman, there are no foot rubs and back massages because she has to comfort her partner who is experiencing the exact same symptoms as her. Mike Dowdall, 25, is suffering from the rare Couvade syndrome with which he endures a phantom pregnancy. Scroll down for video . Mike Dowdall who is experiencing all his girlfriend Amanda Bennet's pregnancy symptoms has a rare medical condition known as Couvade Syndrome . Although it is not medically recognised, Mike from Manchester is experiencing morning sickness, bloating and even sore nipples - and his symptoms coincide exactly with his pregnant partner Amanda's. Speaking on This Morning, the muscular tattoo artist said: 'I was quite ill, I went to my GP and told him what I was experiencing at the same time as Amanda.' After some research it was identified that Mike was suffering from a sympathetic pregnancy. 'I burst out laughing when he said it was a sympathetic pregnancy, as an avid gym goer and jack the lad,' he said on the show. The rare syndrome often happens to men who are very close to their partner- Mike and Amanda have known each other since they were eleven . His partner Amanda Bennet, who has just six weeks to go until the big birth, explained how when her morning sickness began, so did Mike's and it also ceased at the same time. She said: 'I think I was about 9 weeks and I started feeling sick and being sick in the mornings, and he did and I thought ""maybe we've eaten something"", but when it lasted two weeks you think maybe we should go and have this looked at.' And although Amanda has been experiencing the side effects of pregnancy herself, she is very sympathetic towards Mike, who she is expecting a little boy with. Gym regular Mike is annoyed about his two stone weight gain . 'I did show him sympathy, I'd rub his back maybe,' she said. And if the sore nipples and morning sickness isn't bad enough, avid gym-goer Mike has gained two stone, with all the weight piling up around his stomach. 'I don't want to believe it, I want to still go to the gym every day and lose the weight,' he said. 'It's been hard where friends are . concerned, I am quite a laughing stock at the moment but as far as me . and Amanda are concerned it has been the loveliest thing that could have happened to us.' Resident doctor Jonty Heaversedge said: 'What is interesting is that the symptoms have coincided, it can't be serious but it clearly does correlate with this syndrome.' Research states that men who suffer from this syndrome are often those who are extremely close to their partners. Mike and Amanda, who met aged eleven at school and recently etched matching tattoos on each other, have worked together and have always been incredibly close. The bad news for Mike is that he may even endure painful contractions and even post-natal depression. He said: 'If afterwards I don't snap out of it then I will be banging on my doctors door, crying probably.' Couvade syndrome, also known as sympathetic pregnancy, is a condition in which a man experiences some of the same symptoms and behavior of an expectant mother- usually when the pair are very close. The symptoms most often include minor weight gain, altered hormone levels, morning nausea, and disturbed sleep patterns. In more extreme cases they can include labor pains, postpartum depression, and nosebleeds. The labor pain symptom is commonly known as sympathy pain. Couvade syndrome is not a recognised medical condition and some believe it to be a psychosomatic condition, while others believe it may have biological causes relating to hormone changes.","Mike Dowdall suffers morning sickness and sore nipples alongside his pregnant partner .

Thousands of JLS fans were lashed by torrential rain for two hours because of a health and safety ban on umbrellas at an open air concert. An audience of nearly 7,000 went home drenched to the skin after being told off by an on-stage presenter for opening brollies at the rain-sodden amphitheatre in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. The teenagers sat shivering while heavy-handed security staff ensured no one breached the brolly ban throughout the show at the Open Air Theatre on Saturday night. I'm with the band: JB Gill, Marvin Humes, Oritse Williams and Aston Merrygold of JLS were covered by a roof - while those watching them were drenched . While the band were covered by a section of roof, the crowd - who had paid £33 per ticket to see their idols - were forced to suffer. A local councillor said the ban at the venue had been standard from its opening, because large umbrellas 'could poke out someone's eye'. But concert-goers were less impressed, with one teenager claiming her tonsils were so inflamed by the morning that she could neither speak nor swallow and needed emergency antibiotics. Ice cream parlour worker Paige Taylor, 17, from Barrowcliff, Scarborough, now faces at least a week off work. Illness: Paige Taylor, 17, was left with inflamed tonsils and forced to take a week off work after having to stand for two hours in torrential rain at the gig . She said: 'By 8.30 it was absolutely pouring down. A lot of people were putting up their brollies and the security guards were telling everyone to put them down. 'Everyone was shocked and some people started refusing because it was torrential rain. 'Then a presenter came on stage and said, everyone needs to put their brollies down because it’s a health and safety hazard. 'He said ""No one wants their eye poked out"". JLS were under a canopy but we had no shelter at all. 'I could have walked out but I am a big JLS fan and had been looking forward to the concert for weeks.' Her furious mother Lesley, 47, added: 'It’s absolutely disgusting. She came home drenched with all her make-up running down her face. 'You are allowed umbrellas at Wimbledon and football matches which also have seated areas so why not here? 'She was wet through and freezing and was laid up all night awake with painkillers. 'It was a disappointing end to what should have been a great experience. 'The concert should have been cancelled when it started pouring down and everyone given their money back.' Scarborough Council and tourism bosses from Welcome to Yorkshire hosted the event at Europe’s largest open air theatre. Councillor David Jeffels, of Scarborough Council and Welcome to Yorkshire, said the theatre’s umbrella ban had 'been a standard rule from the word go'. He added: 'If you put up one of those big golfing umbrellas you could really clobber someone - or poke them in the face or eye. 'It is generally accepted that you can’t put umbrellas up. You can sit around on a bank at a stately home with umbrellas but not in an auditorium setting. Sunnier times: The open air theatre has no sliding roof protection for visitors - 'because it would have been too expensive' 'It is just one of those hazards. It was unfortunate it was such a poor night. I just hope that the majority of people were adequately dressed.' The theatre, closed since 1986, reopened in 2010 following a £3.5million revamp, paid for by the profits made by redeveloping council-owned land on the seafront. 'If the theatre was covered it would make it a more attractive venue. We did consider putting a sliding roof on. 'But it would have added £1.5m to the cost and the council had already spent a lot of money restoring the theatre. 'I don’t think it is possible to cancel these things when they are being held under contract. They go ahead come what may.' Thank goodness it didn't rain on Her Majesty! The Queen watches a performance at the venue before officially re-opening it in 2010 . However, Scarborough Council had already put the concert back a week. JLS’s management said they had had to juggle with the tour dates to give the boy band more time in the recording studio. John O’Connell, research director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'It’s ridiculous that so much was spent making this venue water-tight, and now the slightest shower has ruined this event. 'Taxpayers will wonder where their hard-earned cash has gone, given that the Council has to make necessary savings. 'Local authorities have to reassess their priorities and reduce spending, and spending like this can be cut out and re-focused on frontline services.'","Freezing conditions left one teenager with inflamed tonsils .

Wellies, rain ponchos and stoic expressions... what better way to face the Bank Holiday weekend washout? Although these revellers at the Leeds Festival had to brave the occasional shower, others across the country found themselves in a marathon 12-hour deluge. Many of us had already rolled the barbecues back into the garden shed, resigned to the fact that the sunshine was over. Are those sunglasses really necessary?

Raining on their parade: Performers shelter from the wet weather at Notting Hill Carnival in west London . Then the heavens opened – and stayed open in some areas from first thing in the morning to well into the evening. And forecasters predict it's not over yet – heavy and persistent rain will sweep through large swathes of Britain today. Long rainy spells are due in the north west, west and Scotland with the wet weather continuing into tomorrow in many areas. Britons who had their hopes of a glorious Bank Holiday dashed by persistent rain are now dealing with another unpleasant side effect of the weather - an explosion in the mosquito and flea populations. The wet and humid conditions have created a perfect breeding ground for midges and mozzies and huge numbers of people have already reported bites. There are even fears of a new 'superflea' evolving - one that is resistant to existing sprays and creams used to tackle the problem. Tesco saw sales of creams shoot up by 150 per cent last week, while the number of people calling NHS Direct for advice on treating bites is at its highest level in three years. Sales of flea treatments are up 25 per cent year on year, according to BBC Radio 4's consumer programme You and Yours. Dr Tim Nuttall, veterinary dermatologist at the University of Liverpool, said the flea population has been rising for the past five years but that it has spiked more dramatically in the past two. He said the increase in numbers is almost all down to the cat flea, which - despite its name - also lives off dogs, ferrets and humans.

They could go as low as  3C (37F) overnight on Thursday.  Forecasters believe the summer of 2012 never . really got off the ground. Brendan Jones from Meteo group summed it up. 'Already the summer we never really had is drawing to a close,' he said. 'Given that June was one of the . wettest since the mid 1800s and July was another very wet month –if you . add all those together you're looking at a fairly cool wet summer. 'And there are some decent bouts of . rain to come.' Scotland faced the worst of the bad weather over the . weekend, with strong winds, and heavy rain leading to minor floods.

A widow claims her house has been turned into a 'goldfish bowl' by a 60ft high school being built yards away. Pamela Burbery, 76, says her life has been ruined by the new development which dwarfs her four-bedroom detached home in Bordesley Green, Birmingham. Many classrooms overlook the property and pupils will be able to stare straight into her bedroom, because their new school stands just 20ft from the bottom of her garden. Living in a goldfish bowl: The New Waverley School looms over Pamela Burbery and her house, which she claims will ruin her life . The grandmother-of-eight has been unable to sell her £240,000 home after buyers were put off by the fact that students will be able to see everything going on there. Retired receptionist Pamela and her late husband Ray, who died this year . aged 77, battled the council for three years before the building work . began. Mrs Burbery says she cannot continue to live in the shadow of the New Waverley School - which will cater for 2,000 pupils from January. 'I am dreading the school term because I know that it won’t be long before literally thousands of pupils will be overlooking my house,' she said. Painful: Pamela Burbery, has been unable to sell her £240,000 home because the giant building is 20ft from her back fence . 'Almost every classroom will have a birds-eye-view of my bedroom and I’ve worked it out that I won’t even be able to make a cup of tea without being watched. 'I feel like I’m under siege. Since my husband passed away this year I’ve been trying to sell up but no one wants to buy because of the new school being built. Tragic: Pamela Burbery's late husband Raymond, pictured, had fought with her to stop the building of the New Waverley School, but he died this year . 'There’s going to be 2,000 children there, there’s going to be three playgrounds. It’s enormous. 'When I complained to the council I was told not to worry because the pupils will be facing the other way but that’s not the point - my home will be like a goldfish bowl with nowhere to hide. 'We’ve had some good weather this summer but I can’t go out in the garden and I can’t hang washing out because the builders are all there. 'And it will be the same when all the children are there. I haven’t been in my garden for 12 months and it’s not going to change now. 'The school overlooks my house, it’s at least 60ft high. I used to look out over fields but now I’m going to be viewed from wherever I am in my house. 'Lots of the windows look over my garden and into my house. If I am standing inside by my french windows then they can see me.' Birmingham City Council granted planning permission to build the school on allotments at the back of her property 12 months ago. Deborah Carpenter, Pamela’s daughter, said: 'We’re just nothing to the council, it’s a joke how people can be treated like this. 'They just sit there shrugging their shoulders. 'It’s absolutely disgusting what can be done to a 76-year-old woman. 'The council should have bought my mum’s house under a compulsory purchase order.' Disruption: Since planning permission was granted a year ago the building has sprung up at an incredible pace . Blot: This digger shows just how close the work has been to the grandmother-of-eight's home . Council bosses have maintained that the plans were passed after consultation with residents. A planning report to members recommended approval on the grounds that it was far enough away from houses and would not result in extra traffic.","Pamela Burbery says life in her Birmingham home has been wrecked by the 60ft high building feet from her back fence .

Hero: SAS man John Thompson, pictured during an underwater training exercise, took part in the Iranian embassy siege and the Falklands War and is selling his impressive collection of medals . An SAS hero who took part in the infamous Iranian embassy siege and daring raids during the Falklands War is selling his medals. Warrant Officer John Thompson, 69, says he only found out they were valuable after going on the ITV antiques programme Real Deal and now hopes to get £12,000 for them at auction next month. The collection from his distinguished career includes one from the UN for his work in Cyprus . in the 1960s, General Service and Northern Ireland medals, a South . Atlantic Medal and the Republic of Korea Service Medal. But despite his television appearance, he should be better known for his bravery in battle. During the 1980 siege of the Iranian embassy, six gunmen took 26 hostages, killed one and threw his body out of the building. Mr Thompson was one of a SAS team flown into London by helicopter who then stormed the . building by abseiling from the roof in a successful rescue bid that . killed five of the terrorists. Thompson and one of his three colleagues from A squadron were sent to . the front of building where they fired gas canisters into the embassy - . and were pictured doing so. He was also one of several brave troops used successfully to attack Argentine forces on the Falklands ahead of the main British assault in 1982. Thompson was secretly dropped in a full three weeks before the full British army arrived, killing the enemy and passing on important information back to the UK without ever being detected. For sale: John Thompson's medals (l-r) U.N Medal, Cyprus; General Service 1962 1 clasp; South Atlantic 1982, with rosette; Regular Army; Republic of Korea service medal . In action: SAS man John Thompson is shown here on the left outside the Iranian Embassy during the siege in 1980, where he fired in gas canisters . Incredibly he is also the only SAS man top take part in the dramatic siege in Kensington and operations in the South Atlantic after Argentina invaded the British Falkland Islands. His story came out after earlier this year he took some axe heads and other ancient artefacts he . found while metal detecting to a TV valuation and at the last minute put . his own medals in his back pocket. He was told by experts his finds would not get him on the programme but he then remembered he had his medals so offered them up instead. Incredible: John was one of the men who led the siege of the Iranian embassy in London in 1980 after he and others entered the Kensington building after being dropped in by helicopter . Famous: The six day siege of the embassy was ended by the SAS after commandos, including John Thompson fired in gas canisters, pictured, and went on to kill five Iranian gunmen inside . A dealer offered him £10,000 pounds and said that if they went to auction the pair would split anything raised above that sum. They are now to go under the hammer at the Dix Noonan Webb saleroom in London during a two day sale staring on September 12. The father-of-two is now hoping for an unexpected windfall when his medals go for auction. Thompson, who is originally from Liverpool and now lives in Anglesea, . with his wife, said: 'I wasn’t intending to sell my medals until I went . to an antiques programme. Bravery: John Thompson was on the Falklands a full three weeks before Britain took them back from the Argentinians. Pictured here the Union flag flies over Port Howard, West Falkland for the first time in more than two months following occupation . 'My daughter saw that Real Deal was filming in Bangor and I decided to . take some of my finds from metal detecting. I had some bronze axe heads . and spear heads. 'On the way out I put my medals in my back pocket, but I didn’t know why I did. 'On the programme the experts gave me valuations for the metal detecting . finds, but there was no way they were going to get me on TV. Warrant Officer Thompson enlisted into the Royal Electrical . Mechanical Engineers where he successfully completed his parachute training, and was eventually posted to Cyprus . on New Year’s day 1964. He was among the first British Paras to remove their red berets and . exchange them for the light blue beret of the United Nations, when the . UN took over responsibility. Thompson transferred to the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, Parachute Brigade, in 1969. Five years later, in 1974, together with his Brigadier, he gained the . rare distinction of being presented at a parade with the Republic of . Korea Service Medal after a year there. In 1978 he successfully applied for and completed his SAS selection and was posted to Boat Troop, “A” Squadron. In May 1980 Thompson was told he was required for a job at the Iranian embassy.The raid by 55 SAS men lasted 17 minutes and all but one of the terrorists were killed. One hostage was killed during the raid. The following year Thompson moved to Boat Troop, “G” Squadron, which . was fortuitous for an eager soldier because that squadron was sent to . the Falklands. Along with his colleagues, Thompson was dropped on the islands and full three weeks before the invasion.He risked his life gathering intelligence on the Argentinian troop movements and spent the conflict taking out enemy patrols. 'My daughter looked disappointed, then I remembered the medals and I got them out they made a lot of phone calls. 'They put me on and the dealer just kept putting thousands of pounds . down on the table. I had no idea they would be worth anything like that. 'I don’t think I said anything, he just kept putting more money down until there was 9,000 pounds on the table. 'After that David Dickinson who hosts the show said we’d finish the deal . after lunch and then we agreed a price of 10,000 pounds. And if it sold . for more than that at auction we’d split the rest. 'I’ve decided to sell because my two children don’t want the medals and I’ll soon be 70. 'And as they say, if you don’t let your medals leave, you’ll leave you medals. 'And the money will be useful of course.' Thompson said he was the only SAS operative to take part in the Iranian . embassy siege and the Falklands because he switched squadron. He said: 'We were on standby when the embassy siege happened and an MoD policeman said we were needed. 'I didn’t want to go because I was just leaving to watch Liverpool play . in Birmingham in the third replay of the FA Cup semi final. 'I remember saying 'find somebody else', but in the end I was pleased I didn’t go because we lost 1-0 against Arsenal.' Pierce Noonan, from the saleroom, said: 'There will be interest in these . medals because Thompson was at the Iranian embassy siege and the covert . intelligence gathering operations in the Falklands, which is unique.' They are in huge demand from collectors because of the story they tell of an incredible SAS soldier’s life who was the only one at the Iranian siege and the Falklands.","John Thompson didn't realise they were valuable until he went to a TV antiques valuation and now hopes for £12,000 at auction .

A restaurant manager who arranged sham marriages and assisted bogus immigration visas has been told to expect a 'substantial' prison sentence after being found guilty by a jury. Gyash Uddin, 39, who ran the Moja restaurant in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, had claimed he was not suspicious about the high number of marriages between his relatives from Bangladesh and Polish women who often worked in the restaurant. The prosecution at Luton Crown Court maintained that Uddin was motivated to bring in relatives to the UK and then ensure they would be able to remain by marrying an EU national. He and eight other people involved in the scam will be sentenced within the month. Six had pleaded guilty and two were convicted by the jury alongside Uddin after a month long trial. Uddin conspired with others to arrange sham marriages for those family members to European nationals who worked for him at Indian restaurants that he owned or ran. Giving one example Will Noble . prosecuting said that on December 13 2010, Dorota Wysocka and Mohammed . Razul Miah attended Milton Keynes Registry Office and registered their . 'Notice of Marriage'. Mr . Noble said 'The registrars noted that Mohammed Razul Miah and Dorota . Wysocka were unable to communicate with one another due to a clear and . obvious language barrier - neither spoke English. He couldn't speak . Polish and she couldn't speak Bengali. The registrars were, as you can . well imagine, understandably suspicious.' Plan: Uddin conspired with others to arrange sham marriages for those family members to European nationals who worked for him at Indian restaurants that he owned or ran . In attendance was Gyash Uddin who purported to act as a Bangali interpreter. 'As well as an inability to communicate with one another, the registrar also noted that there was no interaction whatsoever between Wysocka and Miah during the process,' said the prosecutor who went on 'Due to concerns about the legitimacy of this proposed wedding, the registrars subsequently submitted a 'Suspicious Marriage Report' to the authorities asking them to investigate.' In February 2010 Miah and Wysocka filled out a 'checklist of requirements' for the Registry Office in advance of the wedding indicating that the bride would be unaccompanied, there would be no bridesmaids, no music, no readings or poetry, no camcorders or photographers. Then on February 19 2011, the couple attended the registry office in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire and undertook a civil marriage ceremony and were formerly married. A reception was held at the Moja restaurant but within half an hour of the meal finishing the bride and groom were back working in the kitchen. Mr. Noble said the couple did not live together and Wysocka had a partner in Luton. Uddin, 39, a father of five, from Ivy Road in Luton, Mohammed Razul Miah, 35, of the same address and Mohammed Dolon Miah, 29, of Spencer Road in Luton all pleaded not guilty to charges alleging that they conspired to facilitate a breach of immigration laws by non EU citizens. The prosecution claim Mohammed Razul Miah is Mr Uddin's brother-in-law and Mohammed Dolan Miah is Mr Uddin's nephew. Uddin has British National status. He was found guilty of eight charges of conspiring to facilitate a breach of immigration laws by non EU citizens and the two Miah's were each convicted of two similar charges, which they had denied. Uddin was cleared of possessing articles for use in fraud. Judge David Farrell QC remanded them in custody until all nine can be sentenced together. He told Uddin: 'A substantial sentence is inevitable. You were at the centre of these matters.'","Uddin conspired with others to arrange sham marriages for those family members to European nationals who worked for him .

A rich property broker who owns a Mayfair company with a £1.5m turnover has been convicted of dodging a £28 cab fare. Hugh Wade-Jones, 31, tried to flee without paying the taxi driver after being driven home from a day of heavy drinking with colleagues on June 22. Disgraced Wade-Jones manages 11 people as director of Enness Private Clients, which deals with clients seeking loans of £2.5m for high-value properties. Tom Nicholson, defending, told the court: 'The real risk to his business is going to come from the FSA looking at the conviction. 'There is a real risk not only to impact on him, but to the 11 people he employs.' Wade-Jones had lunch in Marylebone with colleagues from Deutsche Bank on June 21 before meandering through a string of pubs and clubs on his way to Liverpool Street. The high-flying company director hailed a black cab at about midnight to make his way home to exclusive Hampstead, north London. Wade-Jones, who is described on his website as 'goal driven', confessed to having had 'a huge, huge amount to drink'. He jumped out of the cab without paying after being dropped off in Hampstead High Street, Highbury magistrates' court heard on August 23. Driver Patrick James called police after following the drunken businessman to his home 'keeping the meter running until his passenger reached his door.' After a boozy day, the property broker tried to flee from the cab without paying . Mortified Wade-Jones denied making off without paying but was found guilty of making off without a fare, and given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £37 compensation and £600 to the Crown Prosecution Service. The keen marathon runner said he was convinced he had already paid an agreed fee when he jumped in at Liverpool Street. Wade-Jones said: 'All along my gut reaction is I am not someone who is going to run away from taxis. 'I can only stand by my gut feeling, but I am not going to hide the fact that I was extremely drunk.' District Judge John Perkins said: 'By his actions, as recorded by Mr James, he was at that time trying to avoid payment for a taxi, something he would never dream of doing usually. 'I ask myself why he was behaving in a manner that was so out of character? Wade-Jones was driven to exclusive Hampstead before he fled (his home is not pictured here) 'I conclude that a huge amount of drink as often is the case is the cause, but I don't find that it was to such an extent that his intention at that time was dishonest.' His company website says that Wade-Jones is highly-respected in his industry. It says: 'Property is in Hugh’s blood: he grew up in a family of property investors and rapidly rose to be a director of London’s largest mortgage broker. 'Our clients benefit from his unrivalled network of contacts in private and offshore banks. 'His views on the mortgage market are often sought and quoted in the national press as well as writing regular columns for a number of financial publications. 'Outside of work he is equally goal-driven: he is a sub-3 hour marathon runner and his next target is to box as a competitive amateur.' A spokesman for Mr Wade-Jones claims: ""The conviction has been disclosed to the FSA, there is no inquiry and the 'fit and proper person' test does not apply.""","Company director claimed he thought he had already paid fare .

He survived nearly three years as an inmate in the death camp, before making a daring escape. But he was later executed . It could hardly have been a riskier mission - to infiltrate Auschwitz and chronicle Nazi atrocities. Witold Pilecki survived nearly three years as an inmate in the death camp, managing to smuggle out word of executions before making a daring escape. But the Polish resistance hero was crushed by the post-war communist regime tried on trumped-up charges and executed. Six decades on, Poland hopes . Pilecki's remains will be identified among the entangled skeletons and . shattered skulls of resistance fighters being excavated from a mass . grave on the edge of Warsaw's Powazki Military Cemetery. The . exhumations are part of a movement in the resurgent, democratic nation . to officially recognize its war-time heroes and 20th century tragedies. 'He . was unique in the world,' said Zofia Pilecka-Optulowicz, paying tribute . to her father's 1940 decision to walk straight into a Nazi street . roundup with the aim of getting inside the extermination camp. 'I would . like to have a place where I can light a candle for him.' More than 100 skeletons, mostly of men, . have been dug up this summer. On one recent day, forensic workers and . archaeologists wearing blue plastic gloves and masks were carefully . scraping away at the soil and piecing together bones as if working on a . jigsaw puzzle. The front of one skull had been blown away by bullets; another had apparently been bludgeoned; a skeleton showed evidence of multiple gunshot wounds. Near the pit where the bodies were dumped under cover of night stand the well-tended tombstones of the very judges and prosecutors who sent these World War II heroes to their deaths under orders from Moscow, which was fearful that the Polish patriots might use their seasoned underground skills to turn the nation against its new pro-Soviet rulers. Held: In this photo taken in 1940, Witold Pilecki is seen as an inmate of the Auschwitz Birkenau death camp . Discovery: Poland now hopes Pilecki's remains will be identified among the skeletons of resistance fighters currently being excavated from a mass grave on the edge of Warsaw's Powazki Military Cemetery . 'The perpetrators have not been punished . and the bodies of the victims have not been found,' said Krzysztof . Szwagrzyk, a historian in charge of the dig. 'Those times will be coming . back to us until we find the bodies and bury them with due honors. 'We . are doing them justice.' Pilecki's son Andrzej and dozens of other relatives of victims have been swabbed in the hope their DNA will be a match for the skeletons. Initial work is being carried out to determine age, sex, height and injuries of the victims. It will take several months to determine if Pilecki, who was killed by a bullet to the back of his head, is among them. Thousands of resistance fighters were killed across Poland; the remains of up to 400 are believed to have been dumped in the Powazki mass grave. Pilecki was 38 when Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, triggering the start of World War II. He helped organize a resistance campaign during which many fellow fighters were caught and sent to Auschwitz, which in the early war years served more as a camp for Polish resistance fighters than Jews. Grim: More than 100 skeletons, mostly of men, have already been dug up this summer. In this photo an archeologist uncovers a skeleton during works at the cemetery . Patience: A forensic worker sorts through bones during work at the cemetery. It will take several months to determine if Pilecki, who was killed by a bullet to the back of his head, is among them . That inspired him to hatch an . audacious plan: He told other resistance commanders that he wanted to . become an Auschwitz inmate to check on rumors of atrocities. Carrying . documents bearing the alias Tomasz Serafinski, the Catholic cavalry . officer walked into the German SS street roundup in Warsaw in September . 1940, and was put on a train transport to Auschwitz, where he was given . prisoner number 4859. He was 'exceptionally courageous,' said Jacek Pawlowicz, a historian with Warsaw's Institute of National Remembrance. Pilecki is the only person known to have volunteered for Auschwitz. His terse dispatches to the outside world were slips of thin paper stitched inside clothes of inmates leaving the camp or left in nearby fields for others to collect. They included only code names for inmates who were beaten to death, executed by gunfire or gassed. As sketchy as they were, they were the first eyewitness account of the Nazi death machine at Auschwitz. Pilecki survived hard labor, beatings, cold and typhoid fever thanks to support from a clandestine resistance network that he managed to organize inside the camp. Some of its members had access to food, others to clothes or medicines. Past: The exhumations are part of a movement in the resurgent, democratic Poland to officially recognize its war-time heroes and 20th century tragedies . Remembrance: Zofia Pilecka-Optulowicz, daughter of Witold Pilecki, attends a ceremony marking the archeological work at the Powazki cemetery . He plotted a revolt that was to . release inmates with the help of an outside attack by resistance . fighters; it was never attempted because considered too risky, Pawlowicz . said. Pilecki escaped . in April 1943 when he realized that the SS might uncover his work. With . two other men he ran from a night shift at a bakery that was outside the . death camp's barbed wire fence. After his escape, Pilecki wrote three detailed reports on the extermination camp. One describes how his transport was met by yelling SS men and attacking dogs: 'They told one of us to run to a post away from the road, and immediately sent a machine gun round after him. Killed him. 'Ten random colleagues were taken out of the group and shot, as they were walking, as ""collective responsibility"" for the ""escape"" that the SS-men arranged themselves.' Difficult: A forensic worker cleans a skull during the excavation . Pilecki's heroics were for the most part in vain. Even though his accounts of gas chambers made it all the way to Poland's government-in-exile in London and to other Western capitals, few believed what they were reading. After escaping, Pilecki rejoined . Poland's Home Army resistance force and fought in the 1944 Warsaw . Uprising, the city's ill-fated revolt against the Nazis. In 1947, he was arrested by the secret security of the communist regime, imposed on Poland after the war, and falsely accused of planning to assassinate dignitaries. The Soviet plan after World War II was to subdue the Poles by crushing resistance and erasing any sense of Polish identity or history. Today, more than two decades into . Poland's democracy, however, enough documentation and funds have been . gathered to restore the banned past and try to find and identify the . heroes' bodies. In . addition to Pilecki, the search is on for the remains of other wartime . resistance heroes, including Brig. Gen. August Emil Fieldorf, a top . clandestine Home Army commander who once served as emissary to Poland of . the country's government-in-exile. He was accused of ordering killings . of Soviet soldiers charges that Poland's communist authorities later . admitted were fabricated and hanged in 1953. Szwagrzyk . is not sure if Pilecki will be found at Powazki cemetery because it is . not the only such clandestine site in Warsaw or the rest of Poland. Respect: Soldiers and scouts stand in front of coffins containing remains of World War II heroes during a ceremony ending the archeological works at the Powazki cemetery . But his place in history is gradually . being restored. A street in Warsaw is now named after him, as are some . schools across the country.

A 'chancer' who killed four members of the same family when he shunted their car off the road and into a reservoir while rushing to work was jailed for four years yesterday. Mechanic Gordon Dyche, 24, had recently completed a driving ban when he tried to overtake two cars in a row on a winding country road because he was worried he would lose pay if he was late. He passed a Volkswagen Passat which was travelling at 40mph but his Mondeo clipped the back of a people carrier being driven by dedicated foster mother Denise Griffith as she attempted to turn right into  a lay-by to admire the view at a beauty spot. Her Peugeot 807 careered 20ft down a rocky bank and hit a boulder before somersaulting into the reservoir and sinking 50ft. Mrs Griffith's husband of 26 years Emyr, 66, a power station worker, her 84-year-old mother Phyllis Hooper and foster sons Peter Briscombe and Liam Govier, both 14, were trapped inside and drowned. Only Mrs Griffith, 55, and the family dog Milly survived by swimming to safety from Llyn Clywedog Reservoir near Llanidloes, mid Wales. Dyche, who had a history of minor driving offences, had completed a three month ban for driving without insurance just three weeks before the accident on the B4518 in April last year. He denied causing the deaths by careless driving but a jury found him guilty. He was cleared of four counts of causing death by dangerous driving. Judge Niclas Parry told Dyche at Caernarfon Crown Court he had put his own interests above the safety of others. 'You are a chancer behind the wheel,' the judge said. 'You are prepared to put your own interests above the lives of other road users. Bubbly: The biological mother of victim Liam Govier, 14, described him as a lovely, smiley little chap whose favourite school subject was cookery . 'You were late for work. You knew from previous experience the consequences would be docked wages.' Dyche, of Llanbrynmair, mid Wales, who . is married with a young child, was also handed another six month jail . term after it emerged he was serving a suspended prison sentence for . handling stolen goods at the time of the accident. He was also banned . from driving for four years. Tragedy: Autistic Peter Briscombe, aged 14,  died with his foster brother in the accident on April 20 last year . Gordon Dyche, left,  was found guilty of causing death by careless driving when he overtook Denise Griffith's, right, car which crashed into a reservoir killing her husband, mother and two foster sons . Support: Mrs Griffith arrives at Caernarfon Crown Court with her two brothers and other family members for the start of the trial earlier this week . 'Lonely place to be': Mrs Griffith returns to the scene of the crash, which happened when a driver hit her from behind while she was turning into a lay-by next to the reservoir . Drowned: Mrs Griffith's husband, . Emyr Griffith, foster sons, Peter Briscome and Liam Govier, and mother Phyllis Hooper (pictured), all died in the crash . After the verdicts a tearful Mrs .

Oprah's hitting the national airwaves and her return will likely brew some friendly rivalry with her best friend-turned-competitor Gayle King. The 'queen of talk' is slated to be one of the star substitutes who will fill in for Good Morning America host Robin Roberts while she is out on medical leave of absence. While parent company ABC is promoting Oprah's return as a ratings boost for the morning news show, her arrival will also pit her directly against her best friend Gayle King who is one of the hosts of 'CBS This Morning'. Competing for viewers: By filling in for Roberts, Oprah (left) will be in direct competition with her best friend Gayle King (right) who anchors the CBS morning show . Emotional farewell: Roberts (second left with her sister Sally, left, and co-presenters Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer) announced on Thursday morning's show that she was taking her medical leave . Playing favorites: Oprah has appeared on King's program CBS This Morning in the past . Winfrey's return to network television comes as Roberts is leaving her anchor post due to a scheduled bone marrow transplant to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS. The 51-year-old Good Morning America host opted to make Thursday her final show instead of her previously-scheduled Friday departure, saying that she needed to take care of her elderly mother in Mississippi. There has been no exact timetable set regarding Roberts' return, The Huffington Post reports that the network is lining up high0--wattage replacements. A majority of their cadre of stars come from within their own schedule, including regular guest hosts Diane Sawyer, Katie Couric, Barbara Walters, Elisabeth Vargas, and Amy Robach. ABC's ladies: Former GMA anchor Diane Sawyer (left), soon-to-be ABC chat show host Katie Couric (center) and current morning chat show host Kelly Ripa (right) will all take turns filling in for Roberts . Switching chairs: Chris Rock has also been announced as one of the stars who will guest host in Robert's absense . Pulling from other networks: Unlike the female anchors who all have contracts with ABC, Rock and Rob Lowe (pictured) are involved with shows on other FX and NBC respectively . Kelly Ripa, whose own show airs directly after Good Morning America, is also slated for the substitute roster. In addition to their news contributors, the network will also pull from their entertainment division, with the cast of Modern Family leading the charge. Rob Lowe and Chris Rock were also named in the line-up, though their connection to the network and the show is unclear as they both are involved with shows for rival channels NBC and FX respectively. Out of them all, Oprah still reigns supreme, and the fact that GMA producers were able to get her to spent time away from her own fledgling network shows a remarkable get. While the morning show will likely have a major boost from Winfrey's addition, GMA has been doing well on its own regardless, beating the Today show for the first time in 16 years earlier this summer. That said, King's program on CBS remains in their consistent third place position behind NBC and ABC. The departure of Roberts is not a sudden one, as she has been very vocal about her disease and the planned treatment ever since she announced her diagnosis on the show in June. Her sister was found to be a perfect match as a donor for the disease which attacks blood cells and bone. Last day at the office... for now: Robin greets fans and well-wishers outside the New York studios . Roberts, who survived a breast cancer in 2007, said on GMA one of the toughest things she had to do was to move her dog, KJ, out of the house while she undergoes the surgery. She met friends from Maine in Portsmouth, New Hampshire over the weekend and handed over KJ and added on her Twitter account that she 'Cried like a baby.' Roberts previously said: 'KJ has been in my life almost 15 years. She's up in Maine now because when you have a bone marrow transplant you don't have an immune system for a while. And you're very susceptible to infection. And having a dog coming in and out ... that was really hard.' Producers of GMA plan a segment called 'Robin's journey' to show viewers of where she stands with the illness. Roberts told viewers last month that she was anticipating a medical leave in late August, though she had not set a specific date until the announcement on today's GMA.","ABC released a list of stars who will guest-anchor while Good Morning America host Robin Roberts is out on medical leave of absence .

'Relax: Foreign Secretary William Hague said in an interview that Britain should move on from its past and look to the future . Britain should abandon its 'post-colonial guilt' as the rest of the world does not care about the old empire any more, William Hague said today. The Foreign Secretary also said most countries will have a positive view of the UK because of the Olympics, adding this can be used to be more ambitious on the international stage. He added that Britain belongs to a 'networked world' where old grudges against us are dying out. 'I think we should just relax,' he said. 'It’s a long time ago, the retreat from empire.' Mr Hague went on: 'You know, Hillary Clinton comes on the line to discuss Syria and the first thing she says is, ""Congratulations to Britain on the Olympics"". And that’s true of every single foreign minister.' In Africa the older generation will still think of Britain 'in colonial terms', he acknowledged. 'But that is a small minority of the population there. This is a new and equal partnership,' he said. 'It’s a world where networks defeat hierarchies and where the world is not in blocks. It is the networked world and Britain is a natural centre.' He said Harold MacMillan’s wind of change speech, acknowledging independence movements in Africa, was in 1960 'before I was born'. 'It’s a different generation. Britain is seen in a different light', he said. 'We have to get out of this post-colonial guilt. Be confident in ourselves. The lessons we should take from the admitted need for austerity, saving money, is that we actually need to be more ambitious, not less.' Positive: Mr Hague said London 2012 had changed the world's view of Britain and this can be used to be more ambitious . As well as his role in the Foreign Office, Mr Hague is also First Secretary of State and one of the most senior members of the Cabinet. Reports have suggested he could become Tory party chairman or even replace George Osborne as Chancellor in Mr Cameron’s first major reshuffle. But Mr Hague said: 'I’ve always been clear I came back into frontline politics to do foreign policy and that’s what I’m here doing. 'When I was leader of the party there were always polls showing I was the least popular. Since I took no notice of these things I’ve become more popular. So I propose to go on taking no notice whatsoever.'","'I think we should just relax. It’s a long time ago,' The Foreign Minister said.

Charged: Katrina Marie Culberson, 20, was charged with kidnapping and aggravated arson in the death of Celeste Fronsman, 29 . A 20-year-old woman was today charged with the kidnapping, arson, and gruesome death of a 29-year-old woman who police said lived only five miles apart. In addition to aggravated murder, 20-year-old Katrina Marie Culberson of Canton, Ohio was charged with kidnapping and aggravated arson in the death of 29-year-old Celeste Fronsman, according to the Muskingum County Sheriff's Office. Fronsman was found by a truck driver on a remote strip of a central Ohio road, naked and screaming in horror that someone was trying to kill her. There was also a strap around her neck. The sheriff acknowledged the two women were connected, but would not elaborate. After the driver called 911, she was flown by emergency helicopter to Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, but died two days later. Dr Jan Gorniak, the Franklin County coroner, ruled the death a homicide but said it will take four to six weeks before the exact cause of death can be determined because of extensive second-, third- and fourth-degree burns. Scroll down for video . Horrific end: Celeste Fronsman, pictured after two separate arrests, was found by an unnamed truck driver naked and covered in burns . The burns covered more than 80 per cent of her body, the coroner said. Muskingum . County Sheriff Matt Lutz told the Associated Press that Culberson was . arrested Wednesday and that detectives have interviewed her, although he . declined to discuss the contents of their talk. Criminal record: Fronsman had more than 20 previous arrests, many of them for prostitution and cocaine charges . Lutz also declined to say what . detectives believe was the motive or whether anyone else participated in . the killing, saying only that 'there are other people of interest that . investigators are trying to contact.' 'We're going to do everything we can do to prosecute all the people involved in it,' said Lutz, who has called Fronsman's killing 'one of the most gruesome things I've ever seen in 23 1/2 years in law enforcement.' He also has said investigators believe that whoever killed Fronsman knew her. 'This was not a random thing,' he said. Culberson has been arrested at least six times in the last two years on charges that include soliciting for prostitution, theft and burglary, court records show. In the prostitution case, Culberson pleaded no contest and was sentenced to two months in jail. She was found guilty on the burglary charge, while the theft charge against her is pending. Online records show that Culberson lived about five miles away from Fronsman in Canton. No phone number was listed for her. Court records also show that Fronsman was involved in prostitution and was living a dangerous life, having had dozens of brushes with the law since 2003. In less than 10 years, Fronsman was arrested more than 20 times on charges mostly involving domestic violence, cocaine possession and prostitution, records in Canton and Stark County courts show. Desolate: She was found by a truck driver on this stretch of Keyes Road in Muskingum County . Makeshift memorial: A cross has been erected at the site Fronsman was found screaming for help . In all, Fronsman was arrested and convicted of soliciting for prostitution six times since 2005, most recently in March. Her most recent arrest occurred on May 28 for having drug paraphernalia. Her sister, Sarah Gulosh, told the Zanesville Times Recorder that despite her trouble with the law, Fronsman was a loving mother and a good sister and never failed to tell her grandparents how much she loved them. 'This is one of the most gruesome things I've ever seen in 23 1/2 years in law enforcement. This was not a random thing.' -Sheriff Matt Lutz . 'She was a good person,' she said, adding that Fronsman had a heart of gold. Gulosh said her sister was left tortured by the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Jordyn, in 2005, and the death of her mother in 2009. 'We always told her she needed to stop what she was doing and ask God for forgiveness,' Gulosh said. 'But she loved God, and she told us she had asked him for forgiveness.' Her father told the Columbus Dispatch that he last saw his daughter when she and a friend borrowed his truck, promising to return shortly. The father, whose name has not been released, said that he contacted authorities that morning. 'This is a vicious animal,' he said of the murderer at large, adding: 'They ought to be taken off the street and put away.' Evidence: Empty gasoline containers were removed from the scene by investigators . Not a random act: Sheriff Matt Lutz said the crime was the most gruesome he had seen in his career, and that the two women knew each other . The sheriff agreed, and the investigation continues as crime scene examiners were seen removing empty gas containers from the dumpsite. 'This is one of the most gruesome things I have ever seen in 23 and a half years in law enforcement,' Mr Lutz said. 'I can't imagine the pain that this lady went through.'

Labour contacted 91 of England's 151 PCTs - 56% of them reported a decrease in the number of surgeries offering extended opening hours . Nearly 500 more GP surgeries across England have closed their doors at weekends and evenings, fuelling a million extra visits to over-stretched A&E departments. Some patients are being forced to wait up to three weeks to get a basic appointment with their GP, according to figures. And the number of patients forced to languish in hospital corridors for four hours or more has also doubled. There has been a 5.7 per cent drop in the number of clinics offering out-of-hours appointments in the last year. Only 11 bodies governing GPs reported an increase in surgeries seeing patients after hours. The figures, released by Labour’s ‘NHS Check’, were based on the responses of 91 of the 151 Primary Care Trusts and extrapolated to give an estimate for all of England. They come a month after some GPs took industrial action over the future of their pensions. Before the last election, David Cameron said patients should be able to get a GP appointment until 8pm, seven days a week. But Labour shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘The Prime Minister promised patients would be able to get evening appointments with their GP, but our figures show things are heading in the opposite direction – with almost five hundred more surgeries now shutting earlier. ‘The NHS Check revealed a major fall . in the number of GPs’ surgeries offering evening and weekend . appointments – leaving patients unable to see their GP at a convenient . time and with some people waiting up to three weeks for an appointment.’ Mr Burnham added that the Government’s ‘calamitous’ decision to overhaul the NHS had allowed the system to drift. Andy Burnham said Cameron broke his pre-election pledge that all patients would be able to see their local GPs until '8pm seven days a week' The Coalition also stopped the . national monitoring of GP surgeries’ opening hours, which critics said . sent the wrong signal to the NHS. The annual number of visits to A&E departments across England rose from 20.5million to 21.5million. Desperate patients have also increasingly seen after-hours GP services outsourced to private agencies. Last night, the Tories hit back at . the figures, claiming Labour had inflated its numbers on corridor . waiting times by comparing six months of last year’s emergency room . waiting times with 12 months of this year’s. A spokesman said: ‘It is more than a . bit rich for the Labour Party to lecture this Government on access to .

A mesmerising pair of identical twin sisters - cabaret queens more famous for their stunning looks than their talent. In many ways, Janzieska and Roszieska Deutch - better known as Jenny and Rosie Dolly - were the first people in the world who were famous simply for being famous. The Dolly Sisters: Rosie and Jenny - originally Rosika and Yansci - wearing the costumes of showgirls with ostrich feather headdresses, sitting on a low dresser, holding hands, in a dance revue in Paris in 1923 . And now a stunning Art Deco sculpture remembering the fabulous 'Dolly Sisters' - whose allure was the downfall of many a rich man, including Harry Selfridge, founder of Selfridges - is expected to fetch £200,000 at auction next month. The Dolly sisters were born in Budapest on 25 October 1892 to a photographer named Julius and Margarethem the original ambitious mother, who had them performing on the American stage aged 13 after the whole family had emigrated to America. Historical figures: The Chiparas sculpture, left expected to fetch £200,000 at auction next month, and Harry Selfridge, right, who lost most of his £2million fortune thanks to an obsession with the twins . They perfected a single-sex 'tandem' dance act under the name 'The Dolly Sisters' and were making money performing it in beer halls as early as 1907. But the act itself didn't really matter. Jenny and Rosie were pouting, purring, mirror-image dolls for whom audiences went wild. Their lack of actual talent was remarked upon, but no one cared - they were stunning creatures who combined an air of innocence with a seductive, racy, wild side. The stunning ivory and bronze Art Deco sculpture being auctioned in London next month pays tribute to their beauty. Made in 1925 by Romanian-born Demetre Chiparus, it is expected to fetch up to £200,000 at Bonhams in London on 14 November. Tandem twins: Rosie and Jeny Dolly were born in Budapest, Hungary in 1892, and made their name in vaudeville before touring the world with their 'tandem' dance act . In the Bonhams Magazine, writer Neil Lyndon says: 'In the Twenties the Dolly Sisters were celebrities on a scale that dwarfed most movie stars, plutocrats and princes, Yet today not one person in 1,000 could tell you who they were. 'The Dollies were stunningly good looking. Their straight but delicate noses, wide-set eyes and rosebud mouths gave them a seductive air of innocence while their dark eyes and skin suggested depths of gypsy wildness. 'Slight and trim but full-breasted, they were obviously a terrific turn-on for men when they danced together.' Fit for royalty: Men fell at the feet of the twins, and when they arrived in London in the Twenties they danced for Prince George and Prince Henry, the youngest sons of King George V . Thanks to their looks, their vibrant personalities, and the . simple fact that there were two of them, men all over the world were . smitten, and they managed to climb from the vaudeville stage to . the heights of Broadway as cabaret dancing act. With a penchant for feathers, a knack for dressing identically whether on stage or off, and a routine they perfected by practicing in front of the mirror, the sisters created a dynamic, intriguing, seductive package that men could not resist. Men fell at their feet, and when they arrived in London in the Twenties they danced for Prince George and Prince Henry, the youngest sons of King George V. They both married and divorced very young, and soon after became the object of many a devoted admirer, including Harry Selfridge, founder of Selfridges department store in London, who became obsessed with them. Smitten: Thanks to their looks, their vibrant personalities, and the simple fact that there were two of them, men all over the world were in their thrall . Can you tell us apart: The girls always dressed identically, whether on stage or off . At 67 he was twice Jenny's age when he fell in love with her, but that didn't stop him purchasing t her a chateau in France and proposed marriage every week - never receiving the answer for which he dreamed. Selfridge showered the twins with gifts, money and jewels in hope of winning their true affections, and even more so when they developed serious gambling addictions. He paid off their debts with his fortune, and by 1931 was close to bankruptcy after they had whittled away his £2million estate. But the Depression proved to be their downfall. The free money dried up and in 1933 Jenny was involved in a near-fatal car crash that destroyed her looks forever and led her to suicide in 1941. Her sister Rosie attempted unsuccessfully to follow her in 1962, eventually succumbing to heart failure in 1970. The pair had never been able to accept that celebrity can be fleeting.

Heart attack hospitalisations declined by an average of 15 per cent after communities passed laws banning smoking in areas such and restaurants . Smoking bans dramatically reduce the number of people hospitalised for heart attacks, stroke and respiratory diseases such as asthma and emphysema, new research has shown. In the largest analysis of smoke-free legislation to date, American researchers found the more stringent the laws, including those for workplaces, restaurants and bars, resulted in the highest health benefits. The research, published in the American Heart Association journal Circulation, analysed 45 studies covering the US and other countries such as New Zealand and Germany. It found heart attack hospitalisations declined by an average of 15 per cent after communities passed laws banning smoking in areas such as restaurants, bars and workplaces. Admissions for strokes declined by 16 per cent, while hospitalisations for respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were rapidly followed by a 24 per cent decrease in hospitalisation. Exposure to cigarette smoke induces rapid changes in blood chemistry, making it much more prone to clotting. In someone who has narrowed or damaged coronary arteries, smoke exposure can tip the balance and cause a heart attack. The findings are consistent with other studies that have found smoking bans are linked with a decline in cardiac problems. Department of Health figures found the number of heart attacks in England plummeted by 10 per cent in the year after the ban was imposed in July 2007. A similar drop was also recorded in Scotland where another study discovered a 14 per cent decrease in the year after the ban was introduced there. Around 114,000 people die every year from smoking-related diseases. But while many link smoking to lung cancer, the connection between it and heart attacks is less well known. About 275,000 people suffer heart attacks in Britain each year, with 146,000 of those dying.Commenting on the research, Maureen Talbot, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation (BHF), said: ‘The risks of passive smoking on our health are well known and this is the reason smoking legislation was introduced throughout the UK in 2007. ‘Restrictions on smoking in public can help smokers to cut down or quit as well as reducing our exposure to second hand smoke. 'This study provides encouraging data about the benefits of a smoke-free environment on our heart health and shows that the right decision was made five years ago. ‘If we want this downward trend to continue, policy makers should introduce further measures to reduce the appeal of smoking, such as plain, standardised packaging for tobacco.'","The more stringent the laws, the better the health benefits, American researchers found .

A Mexican street dance is putting a spring back in the step of British dementia patients. Twice-weekly sessions of Danzón, Latin ballroom-style dance, improved the mood and behaviour of care home residents. Processing and practising the simple-to-follow steps, enjoying the music and having fun with others also reduced apathy and agitation, both of which are usually treated with powerful drugs. People dance Danzon in the main square of Oaxaca, Mexico. Doing the steps improved the mood of care home residents in the UK . Researcher Guzmán García, who knew the dance from growing up in Mexico, said: ‘I found that these dance classes helped calm agitation and improved mood and quality of life for people with dementia. ‘There are also obvious advantages in terms of physical fitness. ‘I witnessed the joy people got from taking part in the dancing and for residents who were watching, the laughter and happy memories it generated.’ Danzón originated in England in the 17th century and was popular in Jane Austin’s era before becoming fashionable in France, Haiti and, finally, Latin America. It is still popular in Mexico today, with older adults in particular enjoying impromptu dance sessions on the streets. Staff at the Rosewood Villa Residential Home in Newcastle, said that the patients found the 30-minute sessions mentally stimulating and quickly became immersed in the activity. The classes, which formed part of Dr García’s PhD at Newcastle University, were so successful that carers now sometimes use a ‘little Danzón in the corridor’ to help patients unwind. Staff at the Rosewood Villa Residential Home in Newcastle said residents found the dance mentally stimulating . Mary Watson, the home’s owner, said: ‘We could see how much people enjoyed the dancing and it brought back some lovely memories which they were able to share with us of when they were younger. ‘We found that the men wanted to join in with the dancing and this is important to us as it can be harder to find activities that they want to take part in. ‘On the days when the dancing was on, the men made an effort to dress smartly and told us how they were looking forward to it which was really nice.’ Resident Hilda Dumbarton, 92 said: ‘I enjoy everything about the dancing.‘I was the youngest of a large family and most of us danced. I love dancing - I met my husband dancing and he was very good - it brings back happy memories.’ Dr Ian James, who supervised the study published in the journal Dementia, said: ‘The Danzón activity was enjoyed by both the residents and staff and improved the communication between the two groups. ‘Reductions in residents’ agitation and apathy were also seen, which is noteworthy because often these conditions are treated with medications known to have highly problematic side-effects.’ Dr García said: ‘I would encourage all care homes to consider structured and regular dance sessions because of the benefits it brings in terms of behaviour and social interaction which means it can be considered positive for dementia care.’","Danzón originated in England in the 17th century and is still popular in Mexico today .

Parts of London, Essex, Berkshire and Hertfordshire also saw snowfall. Snow that far south in October is a 'one in one hundred years event', . according to The Weather Outlook. Alive and kicking: A red squirrel jumping from rock to rock in Northumberland (pictured above and below) Planes were delayed by up to three hours at Stansted Airport and . flurries were reported at London City Airport, while up to two inches of . snow fell in Scotland, Newcastle and parts of Yorkshire. Meanwhile it is being predicted that Britain could have an incredibly cold winter. Weathermen fanned fears of a repeat of the December 2010 big freeze by revealing indications for more high pressure cutting off mild Atlantic air. This pattern allows Arctic plunges and caused -22C Christmas 2010 chill and weeks of transport chaos. The Met Office still produces long-range forecasts - but stopped publicising them after 2009’s non-existent “BBQ summer” blunder. Forecasters said they were briefing their winter outlook to the Cabinet Office, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, as well as transport leaders, councils and emergency services. More snow could fall than last winter, which was much drier than average in England. This winter shows a 'preference' for average precipitation levels, meaning more moisture-carrying clouds dumping snow if temperatures tumble. There is little hope of a repeat of last year’s mildest winter since 2007-08. Ocean warmth has plunged, with the ‘El Nino’ effect weakening and warm north Atlantic temperatures falling, the forecast said.

The Met Office said its winter forecast is more accurate than ever, after a study showed a new computer programme spots extreme cold patterns missed by the old system. Study author David Fereday said: 'Investment in science is yielding results.' Government meteorologists said their winter outlook was based on forecast models, past observations and 'expert forecaster judgement.' Councils have put thousands of extra staff on winter snow-clearing standby as UK salt stocks nudge a record three million tonnes, beating last winter’s 2.75million. A DfT spokesman said: 'The transport sector is prepared.' Scotland’s Transport Minister Keith Brown said: 'I’m confident we can keep Scotland moving.' British Weather Services has forecast a colder-than-average winter with “significant” snow, -18C temperatures and transport disruption.","Warmer weather fights back in time for half term after parts of UK were colder than Moscow over the weekend .

Staring ahead: Radical Islamic Abu Hamza al-Masri poses for this mugshot following his extradition from Britain to the U.S. Hate preacher Abu Hamza is to be given a new prosthetic hands after U.S. authorities refused to allow him to wear metal hooks in place of his missing hands when he is outside of his jail cell. The radical Islamist cleric is facing U.S. terrorism charges after finally been extradited from Britain after an eight-year legal battle. The Egyptian-born preacher, lost his hands and left eye after mine exploded while he was fighting the Soviet army in Afghanistan. Hamza's lawyer, Jeremy Schneider, told reporters outside the courtroom his client would have his prosthetics changed on Tuesday. They will be paid for by the U.S. government. Mr Schneider said the prosthetics he is allowed to wear, only inside the maximum security jail cell where he is being held, cause pain and irritation on his skin. 'I have no idea what the new prosthetics look like,' Mr Schneider said. Hamza, known for his signature metal hooks, appeared in court without prosthetics on Friday, his arms visibly red. The white-haired and white bearded cleric, who has asked to be referred to in court by his birthname, Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, pleaded not guilty to 11 criminal charges on October 9. He is being held in the maximum security section, known as South 10, of the Metropolitan Correctional Center next door to the courthouse in lower Manhattan. Hooked-handed: The Egyptian-born preacher, pictured here in 2007, lost his hands and left after . mine exploded while he was fighting the Soviet army in Afghanistan . Hamza was accused in 2004 of participating in hostage-taking in Yemen in 1998 that led to the deaths of three Britons and an Australian. U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest set a trial date of August 26, 2013. He is also charged with providing material support to the al Qaeda network by trying to set up a training camp in Oregon and attempting to organize support for the Taliban in Afghanistan. On Friday, Forrest asked both sides about the potential size and scope of the case, which spans 14 years and three continents. The prison: Hamza, who is being held in the top security Manhattan Metropolitan Correction Centre in New York city (pictured), is having to eat all his food through a straw . Jeremy Schneider, his lawyer, and Abu Hamza, who pleaded not guilty to terror charges in a New York court earlier this month . Abu Hamza was arrested at his London home in May 2004. Ironically, he was processed using 'fast track' rules which were introduced at the start of 2004 in a bid to avoid lengthy legal wrangles when extraditing to the U.S. Previously, it took around a year for extradition to go ahead. But it would be EIGHT YEARS and five months before Hamza set foot on American soil. By removing the need for presentation of a prima facie case it brought procedures between the UK and U.S. more in line with extradition arrangements to European countries. But, even then, Hamza had two opportunities to appeal - and when those failed his lawyers used every excuse they could to further delay his removal from the UK for years. The then Home Secretary, David Blunkett, boasted about the new system: 'It will mean much closer co-operation and cut out much of the paperwork which has led to unnecessary delays in the current system and allowed criminals to exploit loopholes and deliberately thwart justice.' Federal prosecutor Edward Kim said 47 boxes of documents and evidence would need to be shipped from Britain. Schneider requested more lawyers to work on the case and said his client would help in preparing his defense. The . judge said the defense could have two law firm partners, two associates . and two paralegals, ""resources to put on a full and fair defense."" She scheduled the next hearing for December 14. During his initial court appearance his lawyer Sabrina Shroff asked a judge to return the metal hooks - but was turned down. Hamza is having to eat all his food through a straw. New York based prosthetic maker Arimed said the hands would be custom made for Hamza. Non electric prosthetics costs between $5,000 and $8,000 each, while high spec models featuring sensors can cost up to $55,000. Hamza, who faces months in jail . before being put on trial, will be given the cheaper option, according . to law enforcement sources. 'We have people on contract. We'd have someone come in a do it,' said a law enforcement source. 'The rule is you give the guy what they had before. Not anything better.' Caged: While he waits to go on trial - which could take anywhere from nine months to two years - Hamza will remain in a bleak New York jail .","Arrived in New York earlier this month following his extradition from Britain .

"By . Victoria Wellman . PUBLISHED: . 10:48 EST, 2 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:59 EST, 2 November 2012 . A historically black women’s college in Atlanta has pulled the plug on its collegiate athletics programme in order to channel the funding towards a campus-wide health and fitness initiative. Spelman College is a liberal arts college that counts prolific African Americans such as Pulitzer prize winning author Alice Walker, Bill Cosby’s daughter and his fictional daughter Rudy – actress, Keisha Knight Pulliam – among its alumni. The announcement on Thursday comes in recognition of the overwhelming number of cases of Type 2 diabetes and obesity affecting one in two students while staggering statistics show four out of five African American in America women are obese. Changing times: Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia, said that it will redirect money that was dedicated to its intercollegiate sports programme - serving just 4 per cent of students - to all 2,100 on campus . The school said it would use the . nearly $1 million that had been dedicated to its intercollegiate sports . program, serving just 4 percent of students, for a campus-wide health . and fitness program benefiting all 2,100. ‘When I was looking at the decision, . it wasn't being driven by the cost as much as the benefit. With $1 . million, 80 student-athletes are benefiting,’ said Dr. Beverly Daniel . Tatum, Spelman's president. ‘Or should we invest in a wellness program . that would touch every student's life?’ Spelman's decision won't influence . the Georgias and Ohio States of the world - where sports have become . inextricable from the identity of the university. But it could attract . notice at a broader band of colleges struggling with budget cuts and . agonizing over whether the cost of college athletics is compatible with . their missions. For Tatum, there is also an element of social responsibility. ‘I have been to funerals of young . alums who were not taking care of themselves, and I believe we can . change that pattern not only for them but for the broader community,’ Tatum said. The Division III school has been part . of the Great South Athletic Conference in seven sports, including . basketball, softball and tennis. Going for a run: The decision comes at a college with a small National Collegiate Athletic Association programme in comparison with the likes of Georgia and Ohio State . Tatum said the school was sending a . letter to the NCAA saying the school would be withdrawing from the . conference and would no longer have an athletics program. Instead, the . school plans to expand wellness programs and renovate fitness . facilities. David Ridpath, an associate professor . of sports administration at Ohio University, called the announcement . eye-catching and predicted it could serve as a model at similar schools. 'With $1million, 80 student-athletes are benefiting. Or should we invest in a wellness programme that would touch every student's life?' Dr Beverly Daniel TatumSpelman College president . ‘I don't really look at this as a . complete anomaly,"" said Ridpath, who is also president-elect of the . Drake Group, a national faculty organization advocating for changes in . college athletics. ‘I think there might be other schools . that try to get out of the rat race and get back to the original view . of we need to worry about the mind and body of our students.’ Spelman is unusually well-suited for . such a move as it will likely face little uproar from alumni. Tatum . acknowledged that Spelman's student-athletes were disappointed when they . were told last spring, but said she was hopeful it would not discourage . them or future students. ‘They are passionate about what they . do and want to keep doing it,’ Tatum said. ‘Students who really want to . be at Spelman will still come to Spelman. Athletics has been important . to those students who have participated but to the overall campus . community it has not been a major emphasis.’ The cost of athletics can be . particularly painful at HBCUs, which have struggled to maintain . enrollment in recent years, due to the weak economy and tighter credit . requirements that have made it harder for some of their often low-income . students to get loans to pay for college. College choice: Spelman's decision could attract notice at a broad band of colleges struggling with budget cuts and agonising over whether the cost of college athletics is compatible with their missions . Earlier this month, all-male . Morehouse College - Spelman's sibling institution in Atlanta - announced . it would furlough faculty and make other budget cuts due to . lower-than-expected enrollment. The economics of college athletics . vary widely from big-time programs to Division III schools where . intercollegiate athletics are little more than another extracurricular . activity. 'I think there might be other schools that try to get out of the rat race and get back to the original view of we need to worry about the mind and body of our students' David RidpathOhio University associate professor . At most places, they lose money for . the college and typically, schools say that's fine. They argue there's . educational value in athletics, and they run all sorts of programs to . benefit students that aren't expected to pay for themselves, from jazz . bands to the English department. It's part of the college experience. But athletics are a part of the . experience for only the tiny percentage of students who participate . directly. According to the NCAA, there are about 400,000 . student-athletes nationwide, but there are 18.6 million undergraduates. New ideas: The Division III school has been part of the Great South Athletic Conference in seven sports . The median Division 1 athletic . program, including those without football, is losing about $10 million . annually, according to NCAA figures. At programs like Spelman, the losses . are less severe but expenses are rising rapidly. For Division III . schools with football programs, expenses from athletics have nearly . doubled since 2004 to $2.9 million for the median school. At schools . without football, such as Spelman, costs have more than doubled to about . $1.4 million annually. At Spelman, the wellness initiative . includes spending money to help renovate the school's Read Hall, which . was built in the 1950s, to make it a state-of-the-art fitness facility, . with expanded hours and programs. ‘We are trying to meet students where . they are in terms of their interest, but also helping them understand . that the elements of wellness ... are the kinds of things that are going . to help them avoid the kinds of illnesses that are killing . African-American women far too early,’ Tatum said. Keeping fit: The school is informing the NCAA that it will withdraw from the conference and no longer have an athletics programme .

More than 20 years after raping and murdering a nine-year-old girl, Donald Moeller was put to death as the victim's mother watched on. Before being given a lethal injection at a South Dakota penitentiary, Moeller, 60, was asked if he had any last words. ‘No sir,’ he said, then added: ‘They’re my fan club?’ Condemned: Donald Moeller (left) was killed by lethal injection for the crime of raping and murdering nine-year-old Becky O'Connell (right) in 1990 . He was given the injection at 10.01pm. and took eight, heavy, final breaths. His eyes stayed open as his skin took on a pink hue before darkening to purple. A coroner checked him for vital signs and pronounced him dead at 10.24pm. His victim, Becky O’Connell, had gone to buy sugar from a convenience store to make lemonade when Moeller kidnapped her in 1990. He drove her to a secluded area near the Big Sioux river, raped her and slashed her throat. Her naked body was found the next day.

Determined: Curl (pictured with her daughter) did everything from throwing fundraisers to selling possessions to raise the money for the 1,400 mile trip to see Moeller die . Savage attack: Authorities say the little girl was lured by Moeller into his truck before driving her to a wooded area near the Iowa state line, raping her, stabbing her, and leaving her to bleed to death . Start to finish: Becky's mother, pictured, raised money last month after she was unable to afford the 1,400-mile road trip from her home in New York to South Dakota to witness the execution .

Crime's impact: Moeller's death sentence in 1992 was the first handed down in South Dakota in 45 years . He even protested against further motions filed on his behalf to stop the execution.

Vince was banned from . owning pets for life and was given a 12-week custodial sentence, . suspended for two years. She was also ordered to pay £500 in costs. RSPCA Inspector Rebecca London said: 'When I first saw the six dogs it was completely shocking. 'Compared to how fit and healthy huskies usually are, these dogs were almost like skeletons.'

'There is no way on earth I would starve dogs. I thought maybe in later years I could take on an old dog, it is like being in a nightmare.' Chantal Vince testified against her mother after the dogs were dumped on her doorstep last December. The 41-year-old who lives three doors down from Vince said she was 'flabbergasted' at the state of the dogs. She said: 'I couldn’t recognise who was who.

'They were ravenous, trying to get anything they could, but one was so lifeless I wasn’t sure she would make it through the night.' Ms Vince said the family had struggled to come to terms with what had happened. She said: 'I still can’t get my head around it, neither can my dad, it is all we have been talking about, trying to figure out what triggered it.

Harold Smith, prosecuting, said: ‘The . defendant said he had been left with a weakness in his left side and . couldn’t walk more than 75 metres in five minutes. He said he walked . with a limp and needed someone with him, seven days a week, to ensure . his safety.’ But after a tip-off, officials from . the Department for Work and Pensions began filming Connor and caught up . with him as he took part in the triathlon in September 2010. Benefits: As well as disability handouts Connor also claimed income support, housing and council tax benefit . It also emerged he had become  a self-employed floor polisher,  carrying tools and equipment without difficulty. The court heard the benefit over-payments from June 2010 to July 2011 amounted to £17,000. Chris Joseph, defending, said Connor . had entered the triathlon as a ‘challenge to himself’ and was . ‘completely out of action’ for some weeks after. Mr Joseph said the . recovery process from the stroke was ‘complex’. ‘Some days he felt he could get up . and work but some days he felt he could be wiped out for days on end,’ he said. ‘In that grey area he became reliant on his benefits and took . it too far.’","Anthony Connor, 39, said a debilitating stroke left him with a limp and he could only walk 75 metres in five minutes .

Three would-be suicide bombers applied to disgraced payday lender Yes Loans for cash to fund an attack more deadly than 7/7, a court heard today. Ashik Ali, Irfan Khalid, both 27, and Irfan Naseer, 31, were cautioned about the sky-high interest rates but believed they would never have to make repayments, it is alleged. Ali also tried to raise funds by applying for an £18,000 business loan and claiming he was setting up his own double glazing firm, Woolwich Crown Court was told. Accused: Irfan Naseer (left), Irfan Khalid (centre) and Ashik Ali (right) applied to disgraced payday lender Yes Loans for cash to fund an attack more deadly than 7/7, a court heard . In the run-up to the planned attacks, . the three discussed buying gifts including quad bikes for themselves so . they could enjoy the final weeks before their martyrdom, jurors heard. The trio are alleged to have planned a . series of explosions at unknown targets across the UK between December . 25, 2010, and September 19 last year. Naseer, known as ‘Chubbs’ or ‘Big . Irfan’ because of his size, and Khalid had travelled twice to Pakistan . to learn about bomb-making, weapons and poisons, the court has been . told. But they were recorded by police . probes as they planned the attacks in a series of conversations in . Naseer’s green Volkswagen Passat. The trio are said to have used . codewords and slang to hide their true intentions, with the Arabic word . handiya - or cooking pot - referring to a bomb. During one exchange, Khalid also . mimicked a Formula One commentator as he joked: ‘It’s the four suicide . bombers driving around ready to take on England.’ In the dock: The trio were cautioned about the sky-high interest rates on payday loans, but believed they would never have to make repayments, it is alleged . He and the others were caught discussing finances with fundraiser Rahin Ahmed, 26, on September 14 last year. ‘Before leaving the car, Naseer told . Ahmed to check with Yes Loans in the morning and all other loans,’ said . prosecutor Brian Altman QC. ‘In fact, two days later, on September 15, Ahmed did submit an online application to Yes Loans for a loan of £20,000.’ Ahmed cautioned the others about . the high interest rates offered by the payday lender, but Naseer said it . would not matter if the ‘ammal’ - Arabic for ‘right way’ or ‘right . path’ - was carried out. He was recorded as he told the others: ‘If the interest rate is 95 per cent but you’re gonna do the ammal, yeah? ‘Who gives a s*** what the interest rate is because you’re not gonna go up anyway? ‘But you’d only be worried and have some worry if the ammal doesn’t take place or I don’t do the ammal, yeah.’ Terror trial: The trial at Woolwich Crown Court (pictured) is expected to last 10 weeks . If the ammal did not take, Naseer said he would leave the country. Ahmed was subsequently disowned by the . other three after he lost £9,000 gambling online using money the group . had raised by posing as collectors for Muslim Aid, jurors have been . told. Yes Loans, based in Cwmbran, south . Wales, was forced to close in March this year after its credit licence . was revoked for dishonest business practices. Two days earlier, Ali had visited a . branch of Barclays in Stratford Road, Birmingham to apply for a £15,000 . business loan, the court heard. Ahmed had visited another branch in . Frederick Street earlier that day to as about the possibility of a . separate £18,000 loan, said Mr Altman. ‘On that same afternoon there was . further secretly recorded conversation in the VW Passat, particularly . between Naseer and Khalid in the initial stages, while Ashik Ali finds . himself in yet another another Barclays Bank, this one on Stratford . Road,’ Prosecutor Brian Altman QC told jurors. Ashik Ali's estranged wife, Salma Kabal, 23, will also go on trial next year accused of failing to inform the authorities of her knowledge of the terror plot . ‘And he’s applying for a £15,000 bank . loan. And in that bank he was overheard by a surveillance officer . claiming dishonestly he was registering a double glazing company called A . Ali, which he told the personal advisor had started trading on the . previous Friday. ‘He gave his home address, said his . total outgoings were £600 a quarter and that he was a driver, spending . £60 per week on petrol.’ He had previously discussed posing as a carpet fitter with the others, the court has been told. Later the same day, Naseer and Khalid . were recorded talking about treating themselves to gifts in the run-up . to their martyrdom, jurors heard. Khalid said: ‘When you know your time’s coming to an end and you want to enjoy something - that’s fair play, innit? Just do it. Get what you want, chill out or whatever but do it within limits.’ Naseer added: ‘At the end of the day, I wouldn’t mind riding a quad bike. It’s good fun, yeah, but I wouldn’t do it on the road - that’s not befitting, bro. ‘A guy with a beard and that sitting on top of that doesn’t look good, bro. People will laugh at you.’ Police later uncovered a note containing bomb-making instructions which one of the gang had tried to destroy by setting fire to it at Ali's home, the court heard. It was created after they began to step up their preparations on September 16 last year, it is alleged. They agreed to buy a 'cold pack', used to treat sports injuries, from a pharmacy using a cover story about a bogus ailment, believing it contained an ingredient they would need to make a bomb. Naseer, of Sparkhill, Birmingham, denies five counts of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts. Khalid of Sparkbrook, Birmingham, denies four counts of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts.

'Murdered': Shaun Corey (pictured), the boyfriend of Karen Otmani who allegedly killed him then kept his body in a wheelie bin in her bedroom for 11 days . A woman killed her boyfriend and kept his body in a wheelie bin in her bedroom for 11 days, a court heard today. When police found Shaun Corey, 42, his body was so decomposed they could not say how he died. Karen Otmani, 42, had been talking about getting rid of her on-off lover and had even asked another boyfriend to experiment with some blue liquid to see if it would knock him out, Bobbie Cheema, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey. Miss Cheema said: 'But when she began to speak about killing Mr Corey, he did not take it seriously. Mr Corey was last seen at Otmani’s home in Forest Hill, south London, on June 4 last year. Miss Cheema said he was heard arguing with Otmani in her bedroom before they were joined by Bernard Beddoe, 60, who she called uncle. After about 10 minutes, it went quiet and Otmani and Beddoe went into the kitchen to make a drink, the court heard. Miss Cheema added: 'Shaun Corey died at the hands of these two defendants. 'His body was found during a search of Karen Otmani’s bedroom. It was hidden inside of a large green wheelie bin.' 'Uncle': Bernard Beddoe (pictured) denies murder and an alternative charge of assisting Otmani knowing she had killed Mr Corey . The court heard Mr Corey was tied to Otmani's bed before he was killed. A post mortem found an 'acute dose' of a drug Xanax in his body - a treatment for anxiety which causes drowsiness, sedation and a reduced alertness. Miss Cheema said Beddoe had gone to Otmani's flat when Mr Corey was still alive. The victim was drugged, taken into Otmani's bedroom and tied to her bed. 'He had been shouting - no doubt from fear having found himself being tied up on Otmani's bed,' Miss Cheema said. 'Beddoe was a willing accomplice before, during and after the murder of Shaun Corey.' The body was wrapped in four layers of tarpaulin and packaging before it was packed into a blue plastic box. It was then put into the wheelie bin in the bedroom. Trial: A post mortem found an 'acute dose' of a drug Xanax in his body - a treatment for anxiety which causes drowsiness, sedation and a reduced alertness, the Old Bailey (pictured) heard . When the packing was examined shoe prints belonging to both the accused killers were found on the tarpaulin. Otmani will admit taking part in the killing of her boyfriend but will claim that she acted out of a 'sudden loss of control.' She will also say she was the victim of 'battered women' syndrome and had been attacked by both Mr Corey and other men. But Miss Cheema said: 'She was an emotional and manipulative woman.'She had toyed with the idea of killing Shaun a long time before June 4.'Beddoe will deny taking part in the murder at all. A boy who heard Mr Corey being killed told police in a video taped interview that Otmani and the victim were 'always arguing.' He said they were shouting at each other before he got up on the morning Mr Corey was killed. The boy said he went upstairs to watch television but could still hear them yelling at eachother. 'Ten minutes later the arguing stopped. They stayed down there for a little while. 'Then they came up. They were making drinks and that. I thought they may have killed Shaun.' But he said after the incident both Beddoes and Otmani 'acted as normal.' Otmani and Beddoe deny murder. Beddoe, of Brockley, south-east London, also denies an alternative charge of assisting Otmani knowing she had killed Mr Corey. The trial continues.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:01 EST, 30 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:50 EST, 31 May 2012 . Police have been accused of wasting £5million prosecuting senior firemen over the deaths of four colleagues in a warehouse blaze – while failing to catch the arsonists who set the building alight. A jury yesterday threw out the case against Timothy Woodward and Adrian Ashley, who were accused of manslaughter through gross negligence in their handling of the fire in 2007. In the worst loss of life for the fire service in 35 years, part-time firemen Ashley Stephens, Darren Yates-Badley, John Averis and Ian Reid died trying to put out the fire. But while police never found the criminals who started the fire in Atherstone-on-Stour, Warwickshire, £4.7million has been spent over five years trying to pin blame for the losses on the managers who let the firemen enter the building even though all employees had already been accounted for. Cleared: Watch Manager Adrian Ashley and Station Manager Timothy Woodward were found not guilty of . manslaughter following the deaths of four firefighters killed when a roof collapsed during warehouse blaze . A third defendant, Paul Simmons, was acquitted on the direction of the judge earlier in the trial at Stafford Crown Court. After the verdicts, critics said . firemen may now hesitate before trying to save lives for fear they could . be arrested. Andy Dark, of the Fire Brigades Union, said: ‘Firefighters . are furious at the police and prosecutors. We believe that the Crown’s case, . which was essentially that firefighters should stand aside and watch . buildings burn, must be challenged by the Secretary of State, if not the . Prime Minister himself.’ The police officer in charge of the . inquiry, Detective Superintendent Ken Lawrence, insisted the . investigation was justified and said he hoped the fire service had . learned lessons from the tragedy. Station Manager Timothy Woodward, 51, and Watch Manager Adrian Ashley, 45, who acted as incident commanders, were charged with gross negligence . manslaughter in February last year following a criminal inquiry which . cost taxpayers £4.6 million. But after hearing six weeks of evidence jurors decided Mr Woodward and Mr Ashley  had not acted illegally during their command of the incident on the evening of November 2 2007. Speaking outside the court, . Warwickshire’s Chief Fire Officer condemned the decision to press . criminal charges against three members of his brigade in the first . place. Anger: Warwickshire Chief Fire Officer Graeme Smith said the charges should never have been brought . Graeme Smith claimed the defendants had . been treated like 'common criminals' and is now calling for the Home . Office and Ministry of Justice to investigate how and why the . prosecution was allowed to proceed. Mr Smith, who was present in court . during much of the six-week trial, said: 'It is crystal clear that these . cases should never have been brought to court in the first place. 'But today neither I nor any of my colleagues in the Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service feel any sense of relief. 'Rather we feel a sense of sorrow and remembrance for the four brave firefighters who died at Atherstone-on-Stour in 2007.' Both Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service and the Chief Fire Officers Association have serious concerns about the case. Mr Smith and both bodies will be . writing to the Home Secretary and to the Justice Secretary to seek a . formal investigation into the prosecution. Mr . Smith was also critical of 'undue aggression' shown towards the . firefighters charged with manslaughter during their time in police . custody. During two days in the custody of . Warwickshire Police, Mr Simmons, Mr Ashley, and Mr Woodward had their . belts and shoelaces taken away and were also held at a police station . overnight between interviews. Mr . Smith said: 'I am seriously concerned - and the public should be . seriously concerned - that today, up and down the country, fire officers . will be asking themselves... why on earth would I ever want to be an . incident commander and face an unjustified legal attack in the way these . three men have?' There were . two independent reports into the blaze, one commissioned by the police . and another commissioned by the Warwickshire Fire Service, which was . seized by the police before Warwickshire Fire Service had a chance to . consider it. Station Manager Timothy Woodward speaks to the media flanked by . Watch Leaders Paul Simmonds and Adrian Ashley outside Stafford Crown . Court. The three men have been cleared of causing the deaths of four . colleagues . Verdict: After hearing six weeks of evidence jurors decided Mr Woodward and Mr Ashley had not acted illegally during their command of the incident on the evening of November 2 2007 . Mr Smith said the investigation had been handled poorly and had put firefighters’ safety behind the needs of the police. He said: 'The police investigation into this fire took a wrong turn very early on. 'The . police treated decent fire officers like common criminals. The court . heard they were locked up in the cells overnight and even had their . shoelaces taken away from them. 'It has taken almost five years and . five million pounds of public money to construct a flimsy case against . these three men and when it was presented in court it simply fell . apart.' Tragedy: Firefighters Ashley Stephens, Darren Yates-Badley, John Averis and Ian Reid were killed as they tackled the blaze in Atherstone-on-Stour, Warwickshire, in 2007 . Collapse: An aerial view shows the roof of the warehouse after it collapsed killing the four firefighters . The Fire Brigade Union said it was absurd that the arsonists who started the blaze had never faced trial, while those who struggled to put it out were 'relentlessly pursued' by police and the CPS . He added: 'Both of these reports . contained safety critical information of vital importance to the safety . of firefighters up and down the country. 'Neither of them was released to the fire service until May 2011 - an incredible three-and-a-half years after the fire. 'I am outraged that the secrecy surrounding these reports meant that firefighters remained at risk for so long.' The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) hit out at police and prosecutors after the two remaining firefighters were cleared. Victims: (clockwise from top left) Darren Yates-Badley, Ashley Stephens, Ian Reid and John Averis were killed  tackling the blaze in Atherstone-on-Stour, Warwickshire, in 2007 . The union said it was absurd that the arsonists who started the blaze had never faced trial, while those who struggled to put it out were 'relentlessly pursued' by police and the CPS. FBU assistant general secretary Andy Dark said: 'This was the first time firefighters at an incident were accused of the manslaughter of their colleagues. 'This prosecution cast a shadow across the whole fire service and caused anger and concern. 'We are relieved at the not-guilty verdicts but firefighters are furious at the police and prosecutors. 'The criminals who started the fire are still free, but those who tried to put the fire out were arrested, charged and brought to trial.' Difficult decisions: Detective Superintendent Ken Lawrence . The officer in charge of the £4.6 million inquiry into the Atherstone-on-Stour tragedy conceded that 'difficult and unpopular' decisions were taken during the investigation. But Detective Superintendent Ken Lawrence believes the scale of the joint inquiry by Warwickshire Police and the Health and Safety Executive was justified by the fact that three men were charged and brought to trial. Describing the inquiry as one of the most complicated undertaken by Warwickshire Police, Mr Lawrence said: 'I think that the investigation has answered a number of important questions, in particular for the families that have lost loved ones. 'I very much hope that the fire service generally will take on board some of the lessons learned from this tragedy and reflect upon them.' Critics of the decision to charge Paul Simmons, Adrian Ashley and Timothy Woodward with gross negligence manslaughter claim too much weight was given to the evidence of one expert witness on firefighting techniques. But Mr Lawrence said the inquiry had been proportionate, appropriate and had sought to establish the reasons for the 'unnecessary' deaths. Mr Lawrence said: 'There have been many challenges to overcome, difficult decisions to make and unpopular actions to take throughout the four and a half years. 'Whatever the result of the trial, the investigation has been successful and has had a number of positive outcome for the families of the four men who died and firefighters in Warwickshire and across the country. 'I promised that we would do everything that we could to determine how the four men - Ashley Stephens, Darren Yates-Badley, Ian Reid and John Averis - died and to find some answers for their families and loved ones. I believe we have done that.' During the inquiry, Mr Lawrence added, some safety critical issues had been discovered which were of great importance for firefighters across Britain. 'As a result of those findings, I believe that there have been some changes to training for the use of breathing apparatus and fire behaviour. 'Investigating the deaths in the way, and to the extent, that we did was the right thing to do and has been justified by the fact that three men were charged and brought to trial.' The probable cause of the blaze was found to be a naked flame - after all other possibilities were excluded - and Warwickshire Police arrested several people on suspicion of arson. But although migrants workers at the vegetable packing plant were interviewed through interpreters in around a dozen languages, there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone with arson. Asked about criticisms of his force’s treatment of the defendants who stood trial, Mr Lawrence said he had led a highly professional inquiry in an independent manner. 'Where there is a loss of life, nobody is above investigation,' he said. “We must never ever lose sight of the fact that four people lost their lives.'","Four firefighters died tackling .

A self-styled Lord and four other fraudsters targeted 600 pensioners from a series of 'sucker lists' in a £6million investment scam, a court heard. Bowler hat-wearing Hugh Rodley, 64, who bought his title and is not a real peer of the realm, tricked elderly people into backing various companies with the promise of 'rich rewards', a jury was told. He was joined in the scam by Julian Silver, 43, Phillip Dennett, 41, Adam Corbett, 31, and Sonny Willis, 28, prosecutors said. They allegedly spent the cash on a lavish lifestyle including a fleet of luxury cars, such as an Aston Martin, Range Rover S3 and a Lotus Elise. The men used high-pressure sales techniques to convince members of the public to invest in firms, claiming they would soon be floated on the stock market, Southwark Crown Court heard. They claimed the cash would be invested in 'exotic' and 'fail-safe' projects such as land development Europe and Asia and water projects, including one for 'desalination by reverse osmosis', it was said. One 87-year-old man was said to been persuaded to invest more than £800,000. But the firms were not floated and investors did not receive any returns, it is alleged. The defendants cherry-picked their targets using so-called 'sucker lists', detailing people who had already invested in some shares. Prosecutor Simon Farrell explained that one of the men in the dock, Lord Rodley bought his title and was 'not a peer of the realm'. He told the jury: 'This case concerns the dishonest extraction of several million pounds from payments of investors who were all promised rich rewards for their investments. 'The proceeds were laundered, converted and transferred to cash between 2004 and 2007. 'Individual members of the public began to receive unsolicited telephone calls from people purporting to be brokers and were convinced to invest substantial amounts of money, often through a hard sell, into various companies. 'They were all told they would quickly make handsome profits as their companies were due to be floated on the AIM - Alternative Investment Market.' It is alleged the gang spent the money on luxury cars including a Lotus Elise, like the one pictured . But none of the companies were in fact floated and none the investors received any profit - they simply lost their money, the court heard. 'This type of trick involving the dishonest selling of worthless shares is colloquially known as a boiler room fraud,' Mr Farrell said. 'There term is used to describe high pressure sales techniques often targeting elderly and vulnerable victims. 'A large number of victims in this case were subjected to high pressure sells and repeated calls until they agreed to invest. 'One 87-year-old gentleman, Mr Birch, unfortunately parted with £828,000 investing in most of the companies. 'Many of the elderly victims are not fools by any stretch of the imagination; they are all successful, responsible individuals who eventually gave in to sales patter.' The first person who tried to target Mr Birch gave up and passed it on to someone else, who later secured the deal, said Mr Farrell. Those who agreed to invest were almost always sent a contract setting out the amount of shares they agreed to, the price per share and a letter providing details of how their share made payment. 'Many of the elderly victims are not fools by any stretch of the imagination; they are all successful, responsible individuals who eventually gave in to sales patter.' Prosecutor Simon Farrell . But most people gained little or no contact afterwards, the court heard. Most people who complained received littly by way of response and those that did were 'fobbed off', said Mr Farrell. 'The companies appear to have done little if any real trading and none of the investors received any return at all. 'Substantial amounts of money from victims were passed through bank accounts either controlled by or for the benefit of the defendants. 'All of the defendants face charges of defrauding the victims out of their money. Other charges represent money laundering.' Mr Farell said at the heart of the scam was a 'floor book' - a list of hundreds of investors. The document was seized after being discovered on Rodley's computer when his property was searched following his arrest . Southwark Crown Court where Lord Hugh Rodley, 64, Julian Silver, 43, Phillip Dennett, 41, Adam Corbett, 31, and Sonny Willis, 28, are on trial . 'Many of the victims are not rich, they just have some savings,' Mr Farrell said. 'The floor book gives us a very interesting picture into how many victims we are talking about. 'But we have to approach it with some caution because the fraud was going on before the start date and after the end date, in fact to early 2007. 'Some people on here were tricked again to con more money out of them. There are also very many victims who are not on this book at all. 'The book has in excess of 1000 names, 600 of which handed over money for investment. They didn't all hand over money, but hundreds did. 'The floor book records around £6million worth of investment and marks as received a figure in the region of £3million. 'But what the bank accounts show is what was actually received that can in fact be traced back to the floor book - around £2.7million. 'The defendants used so-called sucker lists, detailing people with small shareholdings, and started phoning people up offering shares in exotic land development buildings in Europe and Asia and water desalination projects. 'One project was desalination by reverse osmosis.' Mr Farrell described the schemes as 'push button investments', adding: 'Not only was this a wonderful investment, but it's a really good idea and it's going to save the planet. 'People were told it was impossible for it to fail.' Rodley, of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, Dennett, of Warrington, Cheshire, Willis, of Billericay, Essex, Silver, of Ashford, Kent, and Corbett, of Camberley, Surrey, all deny conspiracy to defraud. They are alleged to have committed the offence with Bernard Davies, who died having committed suicide in 2009. They are accused of defrauding customers through companies including World Aqua Tech PLC, ART IT PLC, Mediatel PLC, BMHC PLC, European Land Development Agency PLC, and Eurowaste Recycling PLC, between January 1, 2005 and June 30, 2007. Rodley, Willis and Corbett also deny defrauding customers through Northface Trading Ltd, Datawave Systems Inc and Novopal Limited from January 1, 2005 to December 3, 2005. Rodley, Dennett and Silver deny fraudulent trading in relation to World Aqua Tech Limited between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006. Silver and Dennett deny fraudulent trading in relation to ART IT Limited between January 1, 2005 and June 30, 2007. All five defendants deny converting and transferring the proceeds of the fraud between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006. They each separately face a single charge of converting and transferring criminal property on the same dates. The trial, which is expected to last nine weeks, continues.","Hugh Rodley, 64, who bought his title, 'tricked elderly people into investing with the promise of rich rewards'

A rare vase worth up to £4million was sold for the relatively knock-down price of £550,000 – because a previous owner had turned it into a lamp. The 15th century Ming dynasty vase had been transformed with metal  fittings at the top, and a hole had been drilled through the bottom to attach  a wooden base that obscured the tell-tale six-character mark of Emperor Xuande. It had originally been an incense burner and was possibly used for ceremonial purposes during the emperor’s reign between 1425 and 1435. History: Bidding for the 15th-century vase began at just £5,000, but the price shot up into the hundreds of thousands of pounds. Experts believe that, without the damage, it could have could have sold for millions . The porcelain piece was highly sought after at auction, even though its two halves had been roughly stuck together. Bidding at the sale began at just £5,000, but the price shot up into the hundreds of thousands of pounds. Experts believe that, without the damage, the item could have sold for up to eight times as much as it fetched. Chinese porcelain specialist Richard Peters, of London-based Richard Peters Antiques, said: 'If you believe it is old, and if had been in good condition, it would have been millions - possibly £3million or £4million. 'There has never been anything like it available at auction. 'The only other one like it is in a museum in Taiwan.' Mr Peters agreed that the previous owner who converted the vase into a lamp had made a costly error. 'It certainly doesn't help in terms of value when people start drilling holes through vases,' he said. The vase’s elderly owner had been . given it as a present some time ago and had no idea of its value when he . took it to Duke’s auction house in Dorchester, Dorset. Luckily, Anthony du Boulay, the saleroom’s consultant in Chinese ceramics, identified its heritage. Damaged: A hole drilled into the base of the vase obscured a special six-character mark of the Chinese Emperor Xuande, which would have clearly revealed its rich heritage . The distinctive blue decoration exhibited a technique termed 'heaped and piled', which gives the painted outlines a slightly blurred appearance. This type of decoration is found on Ming ceramics and later Chinese porcelain imitating masterpieces from the period. The vase, which was 15 and a half inches tall including the wooden base, was decorated with leafy tendrils, flowers and crashing waves in a style associated with highly prized early Ming porcelain. The unusual form of the vase was derived from an Islamic prototype in metal and it relates to a rarefied group of Yongle and early Ming porcelains represented in major museums around the world. Guy Schwinge, from Duke’s, said: 'It is tempting to speculate how many millions the vase would have fetched if it had not been damaged when it was converted to a table lamp. Unknown quantity: The owner of the vase received it as a gift - after the wooden top had been bolted on - and had no idea of its value . 'It had been converted long before the vendor was given it and when removing the base, specialist conservators discovered the six character mark of the early Ming Emperor Xuande. 'They also discovered the mark had been partly obliterated when the vase was drilled to convert it to a lamp. 'Chinese porcelain from the reign of Xuande bearing the imperial marks of the Emperor are extremely rare and highly prized by a new breed of collectors from mainland China.' The vase is not the first Chinese work of art to be uncovered by Duke's from an unlikely location. Another vase, which was used as an umbrella stand with a large crack in a house in Swanage, Dorset, sold for £750,000. And a display cabinet in another Dorset property was found to contain jade and other treasures from the Summer Palace, which were sold by Duke’s for £1.5million.","The lamp's elderly owner had no idea of its real value .

A first-born daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will become queen even if she is born before new laws have been passed, Nick Clegg said yesterday. The Deputy Prime Minister revealed that the new rules were effectively already in place, and had been since a meeting of Commonwealth leaders in Perth, Australia, last October. The 16 countries who share the British monarch as head of state agreed to change the current 300-year-old law which gives male heirs priority in the Royal line of succession. Annoucement: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their wedding day - a first-born daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will become queen even if she is born before new laws have been passed, Nick Clegg said yesterday . Speaking in the Commons, Mr Clegg said: “If the birds and bees were to deliver that blessing to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and indeed the nation, then that little girl would be covered by the provisions of these changes of the rules of succession because they operate from the time of the declaration of the Commonwealth summit last October. ‘It is very important to remember that the rules are de facto in place, even though they have yet to be implemented through legislation in the way that I have described.’ Birth: Speaking in the Commons, Mr Clegg said that the girl 'would be covered by the provisions of these changes of the rules of succession' A source close to Mr Clegg said the change in rules was needed now because it would take too long to wait for each of the 16 Commonwealth countries affected to pass a new law. Mr Clegg’s comments came after a question from Tory MP Helen Grant. The MP for Maidstone and The Weald said: ‘If the birds and the bees of the very romantic Isle of Anglesey were to conspire and bless our future King of England and his wife with the patter of tiny feet before this law was enacted, and if that royal baby turned out to be a little girl, would she succeed to the throne?’ The rule change was given fresh urgency by the marriage of William and Kate - as it could have provoked a constitutional crisis if their first child is a girl. But there are fears that the change could fuel the republican movement in Australia, where campaigners could use the opportunity to amend legislation to oust the Queen. The current law of male primogeniture only allows Elizabeth II to be queen because she did not have any brothers. Rules: The current law of male primogeniture only allows Elizabeth II, pictured at the Chelsea Flower Show, to be queen because she did not have any brothers . It also means that the Princess Royal, the Queen’s second born, is just tenth in line to the throne behind her younger brothers Andrew (fourth) and Edward (seventh). In Japan, the Chrysanthemum Throne was rocked by a public backlash over succession laws favouring men when Crown Prince Naruhito and Crown Princess Masako had a girl, Aiko, Princess Toshi. The 15 other countries where Elizabeth II is queen are Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Jamaica, Barbados, the Bahamas, Grenada, Papua New Guinea, the Soloman Islands, Tuvalu, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Antigua and Barbuda, and St Kitts and Nevis. The Commonwealth leaders also agreed to overturn the 1701 Act of Settlement, which means that only the Protestant heirs of the Electress Sophia of Hanover, granddaughter of James I, can become king or queen. The law was brought in following the Glorious Revolution - when a Dutch invasion helped overthrow a Papist king - so that a Catholic could never sit on our throne again.","Revealed that the new rules were effectively already in place, and had been since a meeting of Commonwealth leaders in Perth, Australia, last October .

Despite his age, 37-year-old Beckham had . hoped his efforts to bring the Games to his native east London would get . him into manager Stuart Pearce's side. But is dream has been cruelly taken away. And there has been huge uproar since it was announced today. Back to the day job: Beckham appeared to take the snub in his stride when he was pictured today training with his club side LA Galaxy in California . His pal James Corden, who got to know him through Comic Relief, said: 'To ask David Beckham to give everything to winning the Olympics for . London and then not picking him to take part is so disrespectful.' Ronan Keating tweeted: 'Don't understand why David Beckham was not picked for Olympic team. One of the greatest ambassadors for the game. And still totally capable.' Former Deputy prime Minister John Prescott also said: 'David Beckham deserves to be in Team GB. Played a crucial part in the bid & least he'd be good at penalties!' Beckham has been widely credited with helping win the Games for London in 2005 and has been involved ever since. Only last month icon he flew in from Los Angeles to light the Olympic torch when it landed in Cornwall from Greece, marking the flame's arrival on UK soil. 1975: Born Leytonstone, east London. 1991: Joins Manchester United as trainee. 1996: Helps United to Premier League and FA Cup double. 1999: Helps United win the Premier League, FA Cup and European Cup . 2000: Collects fourth championship winner`s medal as United win title by a record 18 points. 2003: Awarded an OBE, above right, in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to football.

He was also a key part of the delegation that travelled to Singapore in 2005 and won the Games. The rival Paris bid had been expected to win but in an amazing turnaround London beat them. He also represented Britain at the closing ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics by kicking a golden football. Beckham, who has more than 100 England caps and is seen as one of the country's greatest ever players, had . seemed to be certain to be part of the summer event but Micah Richards, . Craig Bellamy and Ryan Giggs have been picked as the over-23 players. Beckham said today: 'Everyone knows . how much playing for my country has always meant to me. So I would have . been honoured to have been part of this unique Team GB squad.' He . added: 'Naturally I am very disappointed, but there will be no bigger . supporter of the team than me.

The celebrated midfielder is also a proud Londoner, so the snub is a double blow. Whenever he's in the capital, Beckham always makes the effort to visit a restaurant for his favourite meal, pie and mash, . having been a fan of the traditional English meal since childhood. In fact, Beckham . paid for a delivery of pie and mash for all the Tottenham Hotspurs . players when he finished training at White Hart Lane last year. He had trained with Spurs during the . US close season in order to try to play for England again after he was . dropped by Fabio Capello. Yet Pearce called dedicated Beckham onWednesday night . to inform him of the decision to leave him out, explaining that he had enough . midfield players and he wanted to add experience to his defence.

A shopping addict and 'hoarder' siphoned £560,000 from a hospital charity fund, spending the money on more than 100 cars has been jailed for three years. Eccentric accountant Brendan Joyce, 57, shunned luxury vehicles like Ferraris and Porsches to buy run-of-the-mill family motors like Vauxhall Carltons and some collectable vehicles including vintage Morris Minors and funeral limousines. He stored 105 cars in more than 80 lock-up garages situated across his home city of Bristol which cost him £4,200-a-month (£50,400-a-year) in rent alone. Bristol Crown Court heard how Joyce, . of Whitchurch, Bristol, trawled online auction sites including eBay to . bid on a range of vehicles, from caravans to a low level trailer. Father-of-two . Joyce was jailed for three years after he admitted five charges of . fraud and asked for a further 152 similar offences to be taken into . consideration. Judge Michael Roach criticised him for . the thefts which were carried out when he worked as an accountant for a . charity raising cash for hospitals. The judge said: ‘It went on for an appreciable length of time. Hoarding at home: When police searched Joyce's Whitechurch home, they found evidence of hoarding with floor to ceiling stacks of boxes full of items and papers . ‘You took considerable efforts to ensure what you were doing was covered up, by paperwork that you were responsible for. ‘As a result the companies and the club have lost over half a million pounds. The effect is obvious. ‘At a time when the medical charities need all the money they can get, they have been put to very considerable loss. Costly compulsion: Joyce bought family cars and collectable vehicles like this vintage Morris Minor, hiding them in 80 garages around Bristol which cost £4,200 a month to rent . ‘The damage to their reputation has to be acknowledged.’ Joyce worked as an accountant for . Above and Beyond, a charity raising money for the nine central Bristol . hospitals, for 17 years. Bosses at the charity began examining finances after sacking Joyce for forging their fire alarm certificates. Investigations . revealed that Joyce had paid himself £562,029.51 from funds relating to . two companies and a charity swimming club. The . companies were Education Centre Management Ltd, which facilitates . management services to University Hospitals Bristol NHS Trust Education . Centre and Pentamed Ltd, which provides training in the use of . anaesthetics. Online shopping: Joyce would buy the cars online on eBay, including this Triumph Stag . Forged signature: Joyce forged the signature on 676 cheques made payable to himself to buy the cars, many of which were of 'relatively low value', prosecutor James Bennett said . Dolphin Swimming Club, based at Bristol Royal Infirmary, was also targeted by Joyce. Prosecutor James Bennett told the . court: ‘In essence, the defendant stole money from two of these . companies and the charity by drawing 676 company cheques made payable to . himself or made payable to cash. ‘This . involved him forging a signature on each cheque. First, he created . fraudulent invoices for work that was not carried out to justify the . drawing of the cheques. ‘Second, . he moved money away from the two companies into the bank account of the . charity to balance the charity's end of year accounts.’ Joyce . was arrested at his home on July 21 last year after Above and Beyond . finance director found discrepancies in his accounting. Defending: 'He was addicted to buying them, he would bid on eBay and this went on and on,' the defendant's lawyer Tabitha Macfarlane said . He told police officers he could no longer afford to pay rent on garages where he kept his cars and matters were ‘down to me alone and no one else was involved’. Mr Bennett said Joyce admitted having a ‘collecting compulsion’ and his ability to exploit his position fuelled his condition. When the defendant's home address was searched there was evidence of hoarding. His home was cluttered from floor to ceiling with boxes of items and papers. Mr Bennett said: ‘The police made inquiries about the defendant's comment about collecting cars. 105 vehicles were traced, including two caravans and a low level trailer. ‘The majority are of relatively low value but others are of some value including Triumph Stags, Jaguar XJs, two funeral limousines and two vintage Morris Minors.’ No large amounts of money were discovered in Joyce's bank account, although he does own his home as well as a property in Brislington, Bristol and a 0.25 acre plot of land behind it. Defending Joyce, Tabitha Macfarlane said the father-of-two was subject of a divorce and his father had died of Parkinson's Disease in 2005, which he had struggled with. She added: ‘He bought motor vehicles. Was there an air conditioned hanger to house them? Were there Porsches and Ferraris? ‘There could be nothing further from the truth. Only one or two were of some worth. ‘He was addicted to buying them, he would bid on eBay and this went on and on. There are 80-plus garages and the cars are of little value to anybody.’ Detective Constable Tim Shortman, whose work on the case alongside Mr Bennett was praised by the Judge, said: ‘Mr Joyce is an eccentric, but clever and very creative. ‘The people he worked with have been devastated by what's been uncovered.’ In a statement Above and Beyond said: ‘We are deeply shocked and saddened to find ourselves a victim of this situation. ‘This criminal behaviour involved a complex and sophisticated fraud which affected the charity's subsidiary company, Education Centre Management Ltd.’ Joyce will appear back at the court on December 6 for a Proceeds of Crime Application.","Brendan Joyce, 57, chose run-of-the-mill cars over luxury vehicles .

"PUBLISHED: . 07:05 EST, 24 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:23 EST, 26 July 2012 . Soldiers struggling to cope with the horrors of war are behind a shocking toll of violence back in Britain, a report has found. One in eight service personnel has attacked someone in a rage after returning from the battlefield. Wives and partners are often the victims. Academics confirmed a strong link between psychological trauma and aggressive behaviour at home. One in eight soldiers has attacked someone after coming home, a new study has found . The findings are especially worrying because British forces have seen a decade of intense conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan. Thirteen thousand troops were . questioned for the study, which was  led by Deirdre MacManus of the . King’s Centre for Military Health Research in London. Nearly 13 per cent admitted being . violent in the weeks following their return from a war zone. The figures . were twice as high for combat troops. And those who experienced multiple . traumatic events on the battlefield – including handling bodies, aiding . the wounded and seeing comrades maimed or killed – were four times more . likely to lash out violently. ‘Army personnel returning home often . find it difficult to adapt to civilian life after deployment,’ said Dr . MacManus. ‘Violence was more common among those who showed aggressive . tendencies before joining the Army, but even when we took that into . account, there was still a strong link between exposure to combat and . traumatic events during deployment and violence on return home.' Former soldier Aaron Wilkinson, 24, (left) shot dead his landlady Judith Garnett (right) after returning from Afghanistan . Earlier this month Aaron Wilkinson, . 24, was jailed for shooting dead his landlady Judith Garnett, 52, at her . farm in Leeds just weeks after serving in Afghanistan with the . Territorial Army. The killer, who was convicted of manslaughter, had . been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder but was not monitored . or treated. Lord Dannatt, the former head of the . Army, said: ‘The whole issue of psychiatric injury, which in its extreme . form expresses itself in PTSD, is going to be expressed in domestic . violence,’ he added. ‘The scale needs to be quantified and more action . needs to be taken.’ Retired colonel Tony Gauvain, a . qualified psychotherapist and chairman of the charity PTSD Resolution, . said soldiers were conditioned to live in a state of hyper-vigilance and . heightened awareness to cope with the dangers of battle. ‘When they get home they are still on this wavelength,’ he said. Col Gauvain added: 'Many find for days, weeks, months and years that their families and people around them don't understand what they have been through. 'There is an immediate communication gap and this becomes a catalyst for temper and anger.' Dr Walter Busuttil, director of medical services at Combat Stress, said: 'We aren't surprised by these findings. Studies from abroad have found instances of violent behaviour in returning troops. 'We know from veterans that anger management issues can ruin their lives. Veterans and their families need to make sure they seek help as soon as possible - not years down the line or after their relationships have suffered irreparable damage.' The Ministry of Defence said it was putting in place measures to improve mental health support for soldiers. Members of each unit are trained in trauma risk management enabling them to recognise signs of stress in their comrades. Anyone identified as being at risk is interviewed to check how they are coping with their problems. An MoD spokesman said: ‘We are determined to make the mental health services our armed forces receive the best in the world.’ PTSD Resolution can be contacted on 0845 021 7873.

Mr Valenzuela admitted to the indiscretion, telling police investigators he had signed up for a 12 step program for sex addicts following the affair, a one-time misdemeanour lasting just 30 minutes. Perry Edwards, the husband of the woman Mr Valenzuela had sex with, became suspicious of his wife after he found sexual text messages to the police officer on her phone. Mr Edwards told 3TV that: ‘I don't think any officer should be able to stay on the force if they've been caught having an affair with somebody else's wife while they're on duty.’ Mr Edward’s sister, Roberta Schneider was equally disgusted. She said: ‘He is supposed to be serving our community, not making booty calls in the back of his car.’ On duty: The disgraced cop drove to the woman's house in his patrol car and in uniform for the one-off 30 minute encounter which cost him his job . Maricopa police chief Steve Stahl said: ‘He showed remorse, he was embarrassed and he wishes to go on with life and hopes that this goes away. ‘He risked his career in this behaviour and the behaviour in and of itself and the penalty in and of itself of losing your career as a law enforcement officer is a pretty heavy penalty to pay. ‘I want to ensure the residents as soon as we found out about the conduct it was investigated very quickly and it was handled very quickly.’ According to the state, Mr Valenzuela’s certification is suspended until September.

Edward Loudell, pictured outside Blackfriars Crown Court, changed his plea to guilty and admitted assaulting trainee solicitor Ross Knight . A disgraced city lawyer is facing jail after today admitting a drunken attack on a trainee colleague after an office party, leaving his career in tatters. Edward Loudell, of prestigious law firm Pinsent Masons, put trainee solicitor Ross Knight, 26, into a headlock and punched him repeatedly in the head after the firm's event to celebrate a London office move. Loudell, 28, was 'arrogant' and 'evasive' when police arrived on the scene on March 25 last year, smirking at them and reeking of alcohol. He had left the work party with Mr Knight, who required hospital treatment for his injuries, at roughly 11pm to continue drinking in another pub. As the pair walked through Hatton Garden, London's famous diamond and jewellery quarter, to their third pub of the night, Loudell put down his briefcase, grabbed Mr Knight in a headlock and shoved him into a shop doorway. He initially denied the charge and claimed he was acting in self-defence after giving the younger man a warning about earlier drunken behaviour, saying that Mr Knight became aggressive towards him and yelled 'I'm going to bash you up!' But the shamed solicitor, who has a 2007 conviction for affray, changed his plea to guilty, admitting acutal bodily harm at Blackfriars Crown Court today. He has since resigned from Pinsent Masons and plans to go abroad to teach English if he is spared a jail term when sentenced at a later date. Mark Graffius, defending, told the court: 'The long and short of it is this has been a disaster for his career.' Jurors were shown CCTV footage which showed the alleged attack by Loudell, of Clarelawn Avenue, Sheen. Ross Knight, pictured, was a 26-year-old trainee solicitor with Pinsent Masons at the time of the attack by senior colleague Edward Loudell in March last year . Tim Devlin, prosecuting, said: 'There were four people - Mr Loudell and Mr Knight were walking behind. 'As they were walking Mr Loudell suddenly set upon Mr Knight. He put his bag on the floor, grabbed Mr Knight around the neck, pushed him into a shop front down onto the floor. 'Mr Loudell was striking Mr Knight. Mr Knight fell to the ground, eventually getting on his side and is trying to ward off hits from Mr Loudell. 'Mr Loudell is talking to him and eventually allows him to get up. What happens next is that they then speak to each other and Mr Loudell grabs Mr Knight around the neck again. 'He puts him in a headlock again back onto the floor. They get up and fall down again and then roll behind a tree.' Police and the ambulance service were called to the scene on Greville Street by concerned neighbours. PC Victoria Borley told the court how Loudell had deliberately misunderstood her line of questioning. The brawl happened after a party held by prestigious law . firm Pinsent Masons to celebrate its London base moving to new offices . in the City of London, pictured . She said: 'He smirked. I noticed that he smelled very strongly of alcohol and he appeared to be drunk. I also noticed that he did not appear to have any visible injuries. 'I would describe his demeanour as arrogant and evasive to questions. I felt he thought he was cleverer than me and he could deliberately appear to misunderstand very simple questions that I was asking him.' When asked to give examples of her questions and Loudell's answers, PC Borley said: 'When I asked if he was injured he said what do you mean by injured? 'Mr Knight by contrast was very shocked. He was clearly shocked. He was upset and had visible facial injuries.' Giving evidence, Mr Knight said: 'I was on the floor. At the time I had no idea where it was. After I was told where I was found - it was outside. 'Edward Loudell is on top of me and I am being punched on the head. A police car comes around the corner - I can see the blue flashing lights.' He added: ""I can remember trying to put my hands up to try and say stop.'","Edward Loudell initially denied causing actual bodily harm but changed plea to guilty halfway through trial .

Details have emerged of the conditions in which murderers Joshua . Komisarjevsky and Steven Hayes are being kept in as the pair await execution in a tough penitentiary. The notorious killers are being . detained at Connecticut's Northern Correctional Institution in Someras . and, while they are only two of 11 inmates in the death penalty section . of the prison, they have no direct contact with one another. On death row: Joshua Komisarjevsky, left, and Steven Hayes, right, are being segregated from other inmates . Both men are now on death row at the Northern Correctional Institution in Somers, Connecticut (pictured) Komisarjevsky and Hayes tortured and murdered Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, in a horrific home invasion. The only person to survive the 2007 attack was husband and father, Dr William Petit, who was beaten, tied . up and taken to the basement. He managed to escape and hop, roll and crawl across a yard to a neighbour's house for help. They are both now on death row, awaiting execution. In an interview with Radar Online, . Brian Garnett, the facility's director of external affairs, revealed . how death row prisoners spend 22 hours a day in their cells with two . hours of recreation. He also said those awaiting execution . are segregate unlike other prisoners who are permitted to socialise by . playing sports and board games. Garnett told Radar Online: . 'We keep them separate for safety and security reasons after instances . in the past where there were very serious assaults between death row . inmates.' Victims: Hayes was convicted in 2010 raping and strangling Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, before tying her daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela, 11, to their beds and setting the house on fire. Father and husband, William Petit, was the only survivor in the horrific 2007 attack . While they are banned from conversing face to face, inmate are able to communicate through cell doors or through ventilations shafts, Garnett added. Garnett told Radar Online: 'They talk to staff so it’s not a situation where they don’t have communication with the folks around them.' The inmates spend much of their time in 8ft by 12ft personal cells. Mental health specialists meet with them three times a week and they are also allowed a once-weekly meeting with a chaplain, two 15-minute phone calls a day as well as unlimited professional visits with their attorneys. The 11 inmates currently . on death row at the facility will be the last to face execution since . capital punishment was abolished in the state. Despite the change in law, the inmates - who range in age from 20s to 60s - will still face execution. Garnett added: 'They are still eligible for the death penalty but no one going forward will be. 'We have had one execution in 2005 . and the last one prior to that was in 1960. The one in 2005 was the . result of the inmate giving up his appeal and volunteering.' Both killers are due to be killed by lethal injection. Horror: An image shown to the court shows the charred bedroom of Hayley Petit after the attack . Earlier this year it emerged that Steven Hayes came up with a bizarre plan to end his own life by lying about other victims. Hayes wrote letters bragging about how he had killed 17 other victims and raped dozens of women.

Police admitted today that there is something 'just not right' in the disappearance of a Hollywood executive who went missing three months ago. Gavin Smith, 57, was reported missing on May 2 when he failed to pick up his teenage son for school in Los Angeles. Authorities have said they strongly suspect foul play over what happened to the former UCLA basketball player.

John Creech, a drug dealer, was being held by police for an unrelated matter but the couple had not been entirely ruled out. According to a source who spoke the LA Times in June, Smith was allegedly having an affair with Mrs Creech whom he met in a drug rehab program four years ago.

Sentenced: Alain Bhatupa was jailed yesterday for sexually assaulting two women who visited him for help . A self-proclaimed spiritual healer who targeted devout Christians was jailed yesterday for sexually assaulting two women who visited him for help. Alain Bhatupa, 37, called himself ‘The Prophet Alain’ during appearances on a satellite television channel which he used as a platform to peddle his bogus healing techniques. A court heard two women approached him at his television station office after watching him promoting healing during his regular slot on the religious Wonderful TV channel. Bhatupa was jailed for nine years yesterday at Harrow Crown Court in North London, almost a month after he was convicted of five counts of sexual assault. Metropolitan Police officers began their investigation last August when the first victim, aged 61, reported that Bhatupa had molested her when she approached him at the office off the North Circular Rd in North London for treatment for severe back pain. The pervert examined her, sexually assaulted her, then asked for a financial ‘offering’ amounting to more than £500. In early September, a second victim, aged 40, reported to police that she had visited Bhatupa the previous month for treatment for an inflamed foot. She was also assaulted and asked to make a £600 ‘offering’. Both victims had seen Bhatupa, of . Upper Edmonton, North London, performing ‘spiritual healings’ on . television and had arranged appointments with him in good faith . believing that he would help them overcome their conditions. Police . raided the Congolese ‘healer’s two business addresses and seized . telephone records, medical swabs and CCTV which linked the victims to . the bogus prophet and Bhatupa. Jailed: Bhatupa was jailed for nine years yesterday at Harrow Crown Court in North London, almost a month after he was convicted of five counts of sexual assault . On his website, Bhatupa claims to be the leader of the ‘International Prophetic and Teaching Ministries in the name of Jesus Christ’. He describes himself as ‘Prophet Archbishop Alain’ and said he appeared four times a week in TV ministry on the African TV channel, which stopped broadcasting earlier this year.. Detective Sergeant Peter Walker, from the Met’s Sapphire unit which specialises in investigating rape and sexual assault cases, said Bhatupa used the televisions station to target ‘devout Christian viewers’. Det Sgt Walker added: ‘He used his position of trust and his television credibility to go on and sexually assault women behind closed doors. It is possible that there are further victims who have been affected by the actions of Bhatupa, and I urge them to come forward and speak to us. ‘The Met takes all matters of rape and sexual assault seriously no matter what the circumstances are, no matter when the crime was committed. Together with our partners we will ensure that victims receive the maximum support possible and be treated with the utmost respect and dignity.’ Bhatupa’s arrest came 18 months after he was cleared of similar offences after a trial at Inner London Crown Court. In that case, a jury were told the Bhatupa, who was described in court as a pastor, had assaulted three women members of his flock after promising to purge them of their demons. He was cleared of two indecent assaults, two counts of assault by penetration and one of exposure, after claiming to be the victim of a malicious campaign by the ex-husband of a woman he was dating.","Alain Bhatupa, 37, was jailed for nine years .

Jimmy Ho, 25, said he was left panic-stricken after being caught up in the security drama caused by his aftershave bottle . Mr Ho, of Ipswich, Suffolk, was flying back to Heathrow after enjoying a mini-break in the Scottish capital with his friends. The insurance worker said he knew something strange was going on when security staff did not return his hand luggage after putting it through a scanning machine. The Spicebomb aftershave, which comes in a grenade-shaped bottle, is made by designers Vikor & Rolf . 'I noticed that everyone was looking at me really strangely, and I had absolutely no idea what was going on,' he said. 'I was waiting quite a while before anyone actually said anything and then they asked me why I had a hand grenade in my luggage and I was totally shocked. 'I had no idea what they were talking about and then I realised it was my fragrance. 'The next thing I know I am surrounded by police and I just felt really panicked. 'I didn't really know what to do - you don't think anything like this will ever happen to you.'

Mr Ho said: 'They went and checked it all out for about 30 minutes so during that time I didn't know what to think. 'Thinking back now I guess it was really silly and I think the design of the bottom is really bad considering. The drama unfolded at Edinburgh Airport after a scanner picked up the Spicebomb aftershave in Mr Ho's hand luggage .

Fighter: Lauren Scruggs, the model who lost her left eye and arm in a horrific plane propeller accident last December, has spoken out for the first time. Her new left eye can be seen . Confident: Speaking to Savannah Guthrie on the Today show, Lauren also showed off her new left arm . 'I've realised God's in control of my life and there's a purpose in this story... I've gained a new perspective. I'm learning to live by faith and not by sight. I'm feeling good.' Lauren, who also showed off her new prosthetic left arm, said she wanted to speak out to assure people she was on the road to recovery and to offer a message of hope to others. 'I just know that a lot of people have been following this story... and it's just good to be out in public as I am, letting people know that I'm doing okay and healing up,' she said. Of the accident, she said she could only recall very little. Inspiration: Lauren, who is in London for the Olympics, said she was inspired by the perseverance of gold-meal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who made an appearance to meet the model . Support: Gabby said she was excited to hear she had inspired Lauren and her recovery . At ease: Lauren laughed with the teen champion, who wished her the best in her recovery . Lauren almost lost her life when she . walked into a plane propeller after taking a short flight in a family . friend's aircraft to see the Dallas Christmas lights from the sky on . December 3. As well as injuries to her face and arm, she suffered a fractured skull, a broken collarbone and brain injuries. Doctors announced they would have to remove her eye two weeks later. 'I remember . my feet touching the ground, getting out of the plane, but that's all I . remember,' she said, adding that she would go into further detail in . her upcoming autobiography, Still Lolo. 'It . was really healing for me personally just to talk about the accident,' she said of writing the book. 'I've gained a new perspective of life and . I feel like I need to use my message of hope and healing to inspire . others just like others have inspired me.' When . asked who she was inspired by at the Olympics, Lauren named Gabby .

"By . Amy Oliver . PUBLISHED: . 06:49 EST, 10 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:11 EST, 11 August 2012 . The Pentagon's F-35 fighter jet programme has been plagued with problems and spiralling costs. But this week, the Department of Defense was keen to put the aircraft's troubles to one side to launch its first weapons test - using an inert bomb with no target. The test marks something of a step forward in the programme, which may yet be axed to reduce the $1.4trillion U.S. deficit. Current Pentagon plans call for . buying . some 2,443 F-35s for the Air Force, . Marine Corps and Navy through to the mid-2030s at a cost projected to . top  $396billion (£254billion). In February last year the Pentagon said . the price of each fighter jet could rise to a staggering $304.15million (£194.8million). Scroll down for video . Test complete: The Pentagon this week successfully carried out its first weapons test on an F-35 jet to see if it could drop an an inert bomb on no particular target . The 1,000lb inert bomb was released over the Atlantic, the Naval Air . Systems Command said in a statement. Wednesday's test checked the jet could actually release a bomb from its . carriage systems and path away from the aircraft but did not check for targeting. 'The . targeting aspect will come further down the road,' said Victor Chen, . spokesman for the F-35 integrated test facility at Patuxent River, . Maryland. He declined to say when however. The event, which was captured on film, is one of thousands being tested this year and starts the 'validation' of the . ability to drop precision weapons on the ground and in . the air, the command added. Dogged by problems: In February last year the Pentagon said the price of each fighter jet could rise to $304.15million (£194.8million) The F-35B is the short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) variant of the F-35A aircraft. It has just two-thirds of the A system's fuel capacity in order to make room for its vertical flight design. Unlike other F-35 designs, the B aircraft has no landing hook. Instead, it sends jet thrust straight downwards during vertical take-offs and landings. Captain Erik Etz, director of test for the naval . versions, said in the statement: 'While . this weapons separation test is just one event in a series of hundreds . of flights and thousands of test points that we are executing this year, . it does represent a significant entry into a new phase of testing for . the F-35 programme.' The Pentagon this year postponed . production of 179 F-35s until after 2017, stretching out development and . testing to curb costly retrofits. But the . latest restructuring, the third such major revamp, has added 33 months and an extra $7.9 billion to the development plan. Last year The commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps  General James Amos defended the programme and said there was 'no plan B' if the plans were axed. He said at the time: 'To do the things that our nation requires of this Marine Corps, we need this airplane. So I don't speculate: ""Will it make it through probation?"" I'm absolutely confident it will.' Hundreds of additional F-35s are . expected to be purchased by U.S. friends and allies, including eight . co-development partners - Britain, Italy, Turkey, Canada, Australia, . Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands. The . F-35, also called the Lightning II, is designed to replace a range of . fighter, strike and ground-attack aircraft, including the F-16, . the world's most widely used fighter jet.

A multi-millionaire who spent £40,000 on a 'Tarzan' climbing frame for his children in the grounds of his country mansion has been ordered to move it - and says the work will cost up to £50,000. Father-of-five Dominic Wainford, a 44-year-old director whose London-based Wainford Holdings investment firm which has been valued at £30 million, owns historic Heathfield Park in Sussex, a Grade II* listed manor house set in 350 acres of landscaped grounds. He built the huge adventure playground for his children three years ago and says he was never told he needed planning approval. Not happy: Dominic Wainford next to the £40,000 climbing frame outside his home in Heathfield Park which he has to move as Wealden Council thinks it's 'bulk and visually unsympathetic' Now he’s been ordered by Wealden Council to rip it down, with planning officers saying he should have applied for consent and it is 'bulky and visually unsympathetic' and must be shifted. Mr Wainford has been forced to apply to the council for permission to dismantle it and move it almost 100 feet to the other side of his driveway - work he says will cost £50,000. He said: 'When we bought the climbing frame, we were told it didn’t need planning permission. You can’t see it from the road and if you had enough strong men you could lift it up, so I was surprised when a planning consultant said we needed permission.' The playground, which includes a timber play house, climbing frame and slide, is nearly 35 feet long and more than 13 feet high, with three chutes, two slides, bridges and swings. He said: 'I’ve got five small children from nine months old to seven years and we can see them playing from the window. Sometimes with their friends, there can be 50 children on there and moving it further from the house will make it less safe. 'By the time I’ve paid for planning consultants and everything, it could have cost me £50,000 to get the job done. On the move: The playground, which includes a timber . play house, climbing frame and slide, is nearly 35 feet long and more . than 13 feet high, with three chutes, two slides, bridges and swings but has to be relocated . 'I’d much rather have been told where to put it in the first place and given the money to charity. It’s not fixed to anything and we’re just very disappointed.' 'There’s no animosity towards the council but I’m very disappointed about the whole thing. There’s been some suggestions that we’ve done this deliberately, but that’s not the case. 'We’re going to have to change the drive, put some gates up, and change the flow of traffic, because our main concern is to protect the safety of the children, and where it’s going to is a less safe environment.' The revised planning application has been agreed by council officers using delegated powers. Heathfield and Waldron Parish Council clerk Diana Francis said: 'My council supports the revised application and considers it a more suitable site, which would not impact upon the listed building.' Tom Foxall, historic buildings inspector for English Heritage, said: 'We previously expressed serious concerns about the positioning of a large children’s play area to the east of the Grade II*-listed Heathfield Park, but do not wish to object to this revised proposal to re-site it.' A Wealden council spokesman said: 'A structure of this size so close to a Grade II* listed building and inside a Grade II historic park, requires planning permission because it dominates its surroundings. 'We have been taking enforcement action to have it moved. We are pleased the owner has now obtained planning permission to move the climbing frame to a location that is more in keeping with the historic landscape at Heathfield Park.'","Dominic Wainford built the playground for his children three years ago and says he was never told he needed planning approval .

Ministers have failed to devise a . ‘credible’ growth strategy and must put the country on an economic ‘war . footing’, according to Tory grandee Lord Heseltine. The Tory grandee, who raised eyebrows in Whitehall by commissioning a cartoon for the cover of his report, calls on the Prime Minister to establish a National Growth . Council to rival the National Security Council and to appoint a . Minister for Growth. He adds that David Cameron and George . Osborne must act now on immigration, airports and energy policy if they . want to boost growth, but his comments were seized on by Labour as proof the government's strategy is not working. Lord Heseltine commissioned this cartoon for the front cover of his report . Lord Heseltine – who helped to . revitalise Liverpool and London Docklands when he was Margaret . Thatcher’s Environment Secretary in the 1980s – also calls on the . Government to take a much more hands-on approach to  funnelling cash to . the regions. In his report published today - No Stone Unturned In Pursuit of Growth - he urges the Coalition to ‘clarify . urgently’ where it wants to build a new hub airport before the next . election and seek approval from voters in 2015, rather than delay any . decision until after the election. The Government should also ‘accelerate . the pace at which it is tackling illegal immigration, overstayers and . the backlog of residency applications’ with an immediate injection of . resources and staff, he adds. Only when illegal residents are . removed, he says, will the Government be able to persuade more skilled . workers to come to the UK. Today Mr Osborne said: 'I wanted Lord Heseltine to do what he does best: challenge received wisdom and give us ideas on how to bring Government and industry together. 'He has done exactly that. This is a report bursting with ideas and we will study it very carefully.' Lord Heseltine's wide-ranging report demands George Osborne do more to intervene to stimulate growth. The . Chancellor was out jogging in Westminster yesterday before Cabinet met in . Downing Street . Some in Whitehall think the report will be quietly shelved. Lord Heseltine takes aim . at ministers squabbling over nuclear power and renewable energy, saying . they must ‘set out a definitive and unambiguous energy policy’ so . businesses have the certainty they need to invest. The report, entitled No Stone . Unturned: In Pursuit of Growth, says the Growth Council should send . money to Local Development Partnerships in struggling areas and work . with a series of Industry Councils in key sectors of the economy. He . adds: ‘A National Growth Strategy must be created in consultation with . the business community, setting out a progressive vision for wealth . creation over the long term.’ Lord Heseltine also demands that everyone works harder to promote growth. He said: ‘Too often we think of he . country’s economic problems as something beyond us as individuals ... We . all need to raise our game, and keep raising it.’ Asked if Mr Cameron needs to put the country on an economic war footing, Lord Heseltine said: ‘We have a national crisis. ‘We need to engage the war psychology, . that we’re all in this together. And this can only happen with . concerted national leadership. Labour leader Ed Miliband said Lord Heseltine's report proved the government's economic strategy is 'not the answer' ‘It’s a war against complacency and . indifference, and on all those who feel they don’t have a role to play, . when they do.’ At Prime Minister's Questions today Labour leader Ed Miliband said Lord Heseltine's criticism was proof the government's economic strategy is not working. Mr Miliband told Mr Cameron: 'You say Lord . Heseltine's report says you're on the right track; goodness knows what . his report would have said if he had said you're on the wrong track. 'He said there was no strategy for jobs and growth, business had no . confidence (and) deregulation - your chosen approach - is not the . answer.' Lord Heseltine said in his report there were people who were 'resistant' to his recommendations. Mr Miliband added: 'We know who they are; the Chancellor and the Prime Minister. 'The evidence of the last two years is that deregulation, sink or swim, their answer is not the answer. Lord Heseltine is right and they're wrong."" But Mr Cameron today hailed the 'excellent report' and repeatedly denied it criticised current Government policies. 'What he is saying is that over decades in our economy, it became too centralised, regions and nations of our countries fell behind, manufacturing halved as a share of national income during the last government, and, for instance, during the boom years in the West Midlands there were no net private sector jobs.' The report was commissioned by Mr Cameron’s former policy . guru Steve Hilton, who left to work in the US earlier this year. Mr Osborne is expected to adopt some of his proposals in the autumn economic statement to Parliament next month. Despite his criticisms on growth, Lord . Heseltine, 79, does explicitly back the Government’s economic strategy, . saying it has  ‘rightly focused on getting debt under control’, which . has ‘cut the deficit by 25 per cent and reduced the cost of borrowing’. Shadow Treasury Minister Rachel Reeves . said: ‘It’s a  damning indictment of this government that, halfway . through this parliament, a former Conservative cabinet minister is still . calling for a plan for growth.’","Business Secretary tells MPs the Prime Minister's Growth Implementation Committee has not met - before remembering it has, and he was there .

A picture of the retired magistrate who starved herself to death after  20 years of suffering . from multiple sclerosis has been released by her heartbroken family as her death rekindles the 'right to die' debate. Monica . Cooke, who was inspired by Tony Nicklinson who lost his own High Court battle to . 'die with dignity', told . her family in the days before she passed that she wanted her death to . help the fight to change the law on assisted dying. An . inquest heard how the 74-year-old, once a keen tennis player and an . active member of several choirs, was cruelly robbed of her ability to . move, taste and smell by the debilitating degenerative condition over . two decades. Her husband of 40 years, David, said . that she had taken the decision to end her life by starvation 'in a . controlled and rational way.' A . family statement read to the coroner said: ‘Having embarked upon the . intended course of action, Monica let it be known within the family that . her perception and intent should be used in any way to extend and . inform the debate on the assisted right to die.’ The . mother from Cheddar, Somerset, closely followed the High Court cases of . Debbie Purdy and Mr Nicklinson, who both battled for the legal right to . be allowed to die. Mrs . Cooke, who has been descried as a cheerful, courageous woman with sharp . intellect, had first expressed her wish to end her lengthy battle with . the crippling disease earlier this year. On August 30, she told her husband that . she was preparing to stop food and fluid after taking courage from Mr . Nicklinson, 58, who died following the collapse of his legal case on . assisted dying. Monica Cooke said she wanted her death to help the fight to change the law on assisted dying, after being inspired by Tony Nicklinson (pictured with his wife Jane) who campaigned for the right to die . The father-of-two, who was left . paralysed after a stroke, died from pneumonia on August 22 after . refusing food and fluid; a week after the High Court had rejected his . request to ‘die with dignity’ with the help of medical professionals. Despite . intervention by her GP, Weston Hospice, daughter Miranda and friends, . Mrs Cooke remained resolute and died on September 7 at her bungalow; . eight days after first refusing food. Mr Cooke said Mr Nicklinson’s final struggle gave his wife the strength to make her wish to die a reality. Resolute: Monica Cooke, 74, stopped eating and died eight days after first refusing food . Speaking . after the hearing on Thursday, he said: ‘The time and manner of Mr Nicklinson's last few days gave her the . courage to put her long-declared intention into action. She wished to . intervene and end her life when she chose.' He added: ‘Needless to say she paid close attention to the various cases in the national press and High Court that addressed the individual's right to seek assistance in the ending of life under extreme circumstances. 'Having embarked on her intended course of action Monica let it be known within the family that her perception and intent should be used in any way to extend and inform the debate on the 'assisted right to die'.' West . Somerset coroner Michael Rose said normally a verdict of suicide would . be recorded but in these exceptional circumstances he was adopting a . narrative verdict. At the . hearing in Taunton, he said he did not “support or condone her decision” as “it was a matter for Parliament to make legislation”. But added: ‘No-one who heard her story could fail to be moved.’ He said: 'There is no dispute in my mind that her death was brought about somewhat prematurely by refusing food. 'I in no way either support or condone the action. Anyone who has been here today cannot help but be moved by what happened. 'Clearly Mrs Cooke was of sound mind and therefore any further action by GP Dr Davies was extremely limited, he could not intervene unless she was mentally unstable - but she clearly wasn't.' In . the statement read to the inquest on Thursday, the family of Mrs Cooke . said she was disappointed with the outcome of fellow MS sufferer Debbie . Purdy’s legal fight. ‘The . Nicklinson case raised similar emotions and led us jointly to the . conclusion that the courts could not act unilaterally and the . politicians would not act because of the lack of political kudos in . addressing such a controversial subject involving small numbers,’ the . statement said. ‘She had . addressed the subject with a detached logical and informed way, . resulting in her strongly held belief in the right to self-determination . and identifying the fallacy of those who believed that palliative care . necessarily restored a tolerable quality of life.’ Mr Cooke told the inquest his wife was an active and outgoing woman, who was slowly crippled by the degenerative disease. She was a marriage guidance councillor for 30 years, enjoyed playing tennis and singing in choirs, and was also a Justice of the Peace in Shepton Mallet and Mendip, Somerset. But the disease had left the once-sprightly magistrate unable to move, taste and smell. Monica was confined to a wheelchair in 2002, which was swapped for an electric one in 2004. Debbie Purdy, multiple sclerosis sufferer, fought for the right to die . The disease had destroyed her body to such an extent that she had to retire as a magistrate because she could not lift the book of sentencing guidelines. He husband says by 2011 Monica was a virtual ""shut-in"", who restricted the number of people who came to see her because she did not want to lose her dignity. He said: 'Nevertheless she remained relatively cheerful as can be witnessed by the various care staff, and nurses who attended her for various reasons and her handful of close friends. 'She engaged them in lively conversation, sharing her wide knowledge of this country, politics, world events, literature and culture. 'After another short infection in April 2012 she started to express to all these people her wish not to continue her life. 'The reasons given were the total loss of any sensations that could give pleasure, a total loss of dignity, and a prospect of further loss of the minimal remaining physical capacity. 'It was done in a matter-of-fact way - nevertheless, all were saddened by the down turn in her attitude. 'This attitude remained unchanged from then until August 2012 when it turned from attitude to resolve.' Right-to-die . campaigners have said the death is another tragic example of why the law . on assisted suicide needs to be changed. Former . MS sufferer Emma Boultwood, whose condition went into remission two . years ago, said: ‘There needs to be a change in the law so that people . can have help when they have reached the end of wanting to live. ‘They . should be given a dignified death and they should not be put in the . position where they have to take drastic measures themselves.’","Magistrate Monica .

Expensive: British pub-goers pay up to ten times more tax on beer than . other European drinkers . British pub-goers pay up to ten times more tax on a pint of beer than other European drinkers. A group of MPs is urging the government to scrap their 2008 beer duty escalator which has seen a 42 per cent increase on beer tax in the last four years. With Britons paying an average of £177 a year in beer tax and a 15 per cent drop in beer sales, the MPs are set to debate the issue tomorrow in parliament. In Spain and Germany, pub-goers pay just £15 in comparison and in France, the Netherlands and Belgium the bill is £21 to £39. Since the introduction of the beer duty escalator, which increases the duty by two per cent above inflation each year, some 6,000 pubs closed their doors as beer taxation cost pub owners around £66,000 per year. The British Beer and Pub Association have welcomed the MP's campaign after an e-petition was signed by more than 100,000 people. Brigid Simmonds, the association’s chief executive, said: ‘I welcome this decision; which shows many MPs are indeed listening to the public on this issue. ‘This is about consumers - pub goers, beer drinkers and licensees who hate the tax which hits everyone hard. ‘The task now is to persuade the Government that excessive tax hikes are the wrong policy, hurting jobs and pubs when instead, we could be delivering growth and employment.’ Tory MP Andrew Griffiths told politics.co.uk: ‘Every time someone drinks cider instead of bitter the Treasury lose 50p. Declining customers: With the increased tax, around 6,000 pubs have closed . their doors with the tax costing pub owners around £66,000 per year . ‘Is it any wonder the cider industry is benefiting because it's able to spend that money marketing its product? ‘The Treasury's own figures reveal that even with the escalator it'll raise no extra revenue over the next two years, because it's hitting beer sales and encouraging people to drink other things.’ A Treasury spokesperson said: ‘The revenues from alcohol duty make an important contribution to tackling Britain's debt crisis. ‘Budget 2012's duty increase and increases to 2014-2015 form part of our credible plan to reduce Britain's debt, which is required to ensure low interest rates and a stable platform for growth. ‘British drinkers are being penalised with disastrous results.’ Drop in beer sales: Britons pay an average of £177 a year in beer tax while in Germany, drinkers pay just £15 .","A group of MPs is urging the government to scrap the beer duty escalator .

A border terrier dog trapped four feet underground has been rescued using equipment usually reserved for finding earthquake survivors. Border terrier Boh was found using state-of-the-art seismic detection equipment after she was trapped underground for four days when he chased a rabbit down a badger’s sett. When fire crews rescued the 23-month-old dog from the hole in Alvechurch, Worcestershire on Wednesday, she still had the dead rabbit in his mouth. Trapped underground: Fire crews used seismic detection equipment, usually reserved for finding earthquake survivors, to find and rescue Boh the border terrier who was trapped 4ft underground for four days . Crew Commander Phil Ball said the team identified a series of entrances to the sett before using seismic and acoustic detection equipment to pinpoint the location of Boh underground. He said: ‘Using an acoustic listening probe, we could hear the sound of heavy breathing which we were pretty sure was an animal in distress, rather than simply a badger inside its sett. ‘We then used a “snake eye” camera and we were able to locate the dog in a 10ft long tunnel around four feet below the ground. ‘It would seem that the dog had become trapped in the sett with the rabbit wedged in its mouth. ‘This had made it impossible for the dog to breathe through its mouth and so had been struggling to breathe through its nose, hence the laboured breathing we could hear with our detection equipment.’ Boh, who was hungry and dehydrated, was taken to the vets and given fluids and antibiotics for an eye infection. Rabbit hunting: Boh was trapped after she chased a rabbit down a 10ft-long badger sett. When she was rescued she still had the dead rabbit in his mouth . She has since been reunited with his relieved owner, dairy farmer Adrian Bytom, 50, in Alvechurch, Worcestershire. He said today: ‘Boh is an adventurous dog and just chases everything she can. ‘She was out walking on our land and she just disappeared, we were worried sick but she’s a tough little thing. ‘We’re very relieved to have her home and she’s enjoying all the attention she’s getting.’ Wife Alison Bytom 48, feared Boh was dead when the 23-month-old dog didn't come back after going for a walk with her farmer husband Adrian, 50, on Sunday morning. Mother-of-three Dr Bytom, a GP, who lives on a 100-acre farm, said: 'Boh and our other border terrier Dilly, who is actually Boh's mother, were out in the fields with Adrian on Sunday morning when she just disappeared. 'She doesn't normally do that so we thought that she must have gone down a hole. 'We searched all that day and the next day and just couldn't find her. 'The next day I had to go to work but my sister called the fire and rescue people and the RSPCA because we needed a licence to move badger's setts. 'They searched three setts and when they came to the fourth one they heard groaning from inside.' Eyes in the dark: Fire crews used a 'snake eye' camera like this one to locate the dog down a 10ft-long badger's sett . 'They brought her out and she was a bit wobbly and collapsed. But we took her to the vets and she had fluids and antibiotics and is gradually recovering.' Their 10-year-old son Olly was so worried about Boh that he stayed with her the night she was rescued in case she stopped breathing. She added: 'The kids were so distressed and there was so much interest in finding her thanks to Facebook and their Blackberry messaging. 'Olly got his sleeping bag out and slept with Boh on the hard floor all of Wednesday night to make sure she was okay. 'She feels a bit sorry for herself at the moment but she hasn't learnt her lesson. 'We've got a pet rabbit we keep in the garden and she is still incredibly interested in running after it. 'It's like she gets red mist when she sees a rabbit and ignores everything else.' Before Boh could be rescued, officers from Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service had to get permission from English Heritage to dig up the sett because badgers are protected. The equipment can pick up noises from trapped victims by converting vibrations created by the victim into audible and visual signals that are then detected by the equipment. It is used mostly to find victims trapped under collapsed structures and earth caused by earthquakes, explosions, landslides and mine disasters.","Boh the border terrier dog was trapped underground for four day .

A close friend of Jimmy Savile today revealed his shame at failing to spot any of the alleged abuse of young girls by the TV star. DJ . Dave Eager, who worked with Savile in the 1960s, spoke of his guilt for the first time today as police investigate 300 potential victims of the Jim'll Fix It host. The 64-year-old declared he 'should be punished' for not realising what was happening throughout their 40 year friendship. Scroll down to watch video . 'Eager helper': Dave Eager was so distraught at Savile's funeral in November last year he wore a 'Jim fixed it for me' badge and jumper but has since said he feels guilty for failing to notice any of the alleged abuse done by Savile during their 40-year friendship . But the DJ, who wore a ‘Jimmy’s eager . helper’ jumper and ‘Jim fixed it for me’ badge as tribute to the star at his funeral in November last year, claims he never saw anything to make him suspect Savile was abusing girls. He told The Sun: ‘I just don’t recognise this so you end up blaming yourself. ‘I just don’t know what’s going on. I feel I should be punished. I’m very distressed about the whole thing.’ The pair worked together at the Top . Ten Club in Manchester in the 1960s where they formed a friendship, . continuing to stay in touch throughout their careers. 'Would have spoken out': Mr Eager said that if he had seen anything to . suggest the alleged abuse done by Savile, pictured left on Top Of The . Pops in 1976 and right in 2007, he would have spoken out . Mr Eager said: ‘You look up to somebody for years and then suddenly wham, bam, wallop, thank you, what have I been doing? ‘There . is nothing I recognise at all. I can’t help but blame myself and there . must be other people like me. You think, “Hang on, if we’d seen . something we would have spoken out”. ‘The 70s were the 70s and we were having fun. A lot of it was a bit of a blur because we were all having a bit of fun. ‘But when I read in the paper something about a nine-year-old boy, or whatever, I think, “This can’t be real”.’ DJ pals: Mr Eager knew Savile from working together at the Top Ten Club in Manchester in the 1960s and remained friends throughout their careers . As the scandal went public and . the allegations worsened, Mr Eager decided to leave his home in Thornton . Cleveleys, Lancashire and headed for Spain. Of their 40-year friendship, Mr Eager . said: ‘I knew him through working as a DJ. I was based at the Top Ten . and I met him originally when I was in a band. ‘Jim tended to keep things in compartments and people only knew a few of his friends. ‘After . the Top Ten, Jim moved out of Manchester and people at the club hardly . ever saw him. I kept in touch and we’d bump into each other every now . and then.’ Mr Eager found it hard to believe that none of those close to Savile had not known about the abuse that carried on for years. He . said: ‘Everyone knows Jim was a canny fella. Compared to Jim, I’m . insignificant but he was mixing with people who were equally as shrewd . and canny and had reputations to protect. ‘What . I can’t get my head around is if there were so many shrewd and canny . people around him, how come they didn’t see anything? ‘For . them all to say they didn’t notice, well it all sounds unbelievable. Like a lot of others I’m completely and utterly gobsmacked. ‘You . feel traumatised and sorry for the people abused by Jimmy but equally . you think, “Why the bloody hell didn’t we see something?”’ Mr . Eager’s comments come after it was revealed that Savile was barred from . any involvement with the BBC's Children In Need charity. Repeated complaints were made by victims made to police, including officers in Surrey, . Sussex and Jersey but officers found that there was not enough . evidence to proceed with the allegations they received. Two potential . victims came forward to Scotland Yard - one of whom claimed she had been . abused in the 1970s but did not want to pursue a criminal . investigation. An . independent probe has been launched into the BBC's ‘culture and . practices’ during Savile's career, led by former Court of Appeal judge . Dame Janet Smith.

With two divorces behind him, one of which revealed his taste for drinking and prostitutes, the queen’s cousin may have been forgiven for turning his back on the institution of marriage. But the 18th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne has now walked down the aisle for a third time. Michael Bowes-Lyon, 55, made   former shop manager and divorced mother-of-two Karen Baxter his new Countess last weekend in a low-key ceremony in the grounds of his £12 million seat, Glamis Castle, near Forfar, Angus. Newlyweds: The Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne is pictured with his third wife, Karen Baxter . The troubled aristocrat’s family, including his mother Mary, Dowager Countess of Strathmore, and his four sons are said to be ‘delighted’. The happy couple, who became engaged last year, first met while Mrs Baxter was manager of an ironmongers near Forfar. The Earl acquired the business six years ago while still married to his second wife, Damaris. Mrs Baxter later became financial manager of one of Strathmore’s companies and, following the end of his second marriage,  is said to have become a ‘highly positive’ influence on him. Royal links: Michael Bowes-Lyon is a first cousin once removed of the Queen, pictured above during a visit to Northern Ireland in June . Yesterday, a spokesman for the peer, who is one of Scotland’s richest men, said: ‘The Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne married Karen Baxter in a quiet ceremony at Glamis on Saturday, August 4. Both families are delighted.’ The former Scots Guards captain – known as Mikey to his friends – and his first wife, Isobel, split in 2004 after a 20-year marriage. They have three sons. It was during the break-up that the Earl was exposed in a Sunday newspaper for hiring three prostitutes and indulging in a four-day ‘sex marathon’ at his second stately home, Holwick Lodge, in Co Durham. After the revelations, the Earl expressed his regret, issuing a statement saying the event had happened during ‘an extremely difficult phase’ in his life. His solicitor also said the Earl had been drinking heavily.

A North Carolina grandfather who disappeared during a New Hampshire vacation after falling, hitting his head and losing his memory has been reunited with his family. After falling down a ravine during a solitary walk, 72-year-old Hugh Armstrong lost his memory and hitchhiked 1,000 miles to his home state, gradually collecting clues about his life on the journey. Now safely home after a 16-day fugue, today he told ABC, ‘I'll tell you something, it's very nice to know who you are.’ Scroll down for video . Reunited: Hugh Armstrong lost his memory after falling and hitting his head in New Hampshire; he then traveled 1,000 miles to his home state of North Carolina and was reunited with his wife, Ellen, on Saturday - 16 days after he disappeared . On July 25, the retired IBM employee decided to go for a walk around a nearby lake. Armstrong recalled leaving a note saying he’d be back by 9 to have a pancake breakfast with his grandchildren. But he never returned. The grandfather doesn’t remember falling down a ravine but just recalls waking up after dark with no idea of who he was. ‘The only thing I could remember at that time was I didn't know who I was, but I had to go south and west, so that's where I started going,’ he told the news station. From there ensued an incredible journey home that will surely thrill Hollywood script writers. Unable to recall his name, Armstrong hitchhiked and walked 1,000 miles south. He said a farmer in Pennsylvania or Virginia hired him to help hay. The good Samaritan farmer paid him, put him up, fed him and drove him to Roanoke, Virginia. Incredible odyssey: North Carolina man Hugh Armstrong hitchhiked and walked 1,000 miles home from New Hampshire in a two-week fugue, without knowing who he was. A breakthrough then came when he was hitching a lift from a truck driver. After telling the driver that he thought he was from North Carolina, the man started listing towns. When the driver said Asheville, Armstrong knew that was where he needed to get to. Another stroke of luck came at a McDonald's when he heard a mother calling for her daughter, Emma. He remembered that he had a granddaughter named Emma living in Wilmington, North Carolina and began writing her a letter. He wrote, 'I don't know who I am, but hopefully you will,’ reported ABC. He signed the letter with the initials and date he found on the inside of his wedding ring. However, he couldn’t recall her address. But watching TV that night he heard someone mention a .410 shotgun which triggered him to remember the number of Emma’s address. He then scoured a phone book to find the right address. Desperate for someone to recognise him, Armstrong traipsed round parks and shopping malls. No idea who he was Armstrong was put up for several days by a Good-Samaritan farmer in Pennsylvania, who eventually gave him a ride to Roanoke, Virgina . Sixteen days after he disappeared, he was finally found by a sheriff's deputy, walking along U.S. Highway 70 in North Carolina at 1:30 a.m. Saturday morning. He was about 230 west of his home in Clayton. 'He's my hero. That's just a remarkable feat,' said Deputy Brian Walker of the McDowell County Sheriff's Department following the end of the remarkable tale. He told officers he didn’t know his name, only his initials, and thought he was around 71-years-old. After using a missing person’s database, officers were able to discover his identity. At 3.30am his wife, Ellen, then got the call she had been desperate for. After talking to him on the phone, she drove with their daughter to the sheriff's office to take him home. As soon as Ellen stepped out the car, Armstrong said, 'That's my wife,' the sheriff's deputy recalled. Ellen Armstrong told ABC that her husband gave them the ‘biggest bear hug’ when they walked through the door. The retired IBM employee was reunited with his family after he overheard his granddaughter's first name in a N.C. McDonald's, found her in a phone book, and penned her a letter . Not knowing who you are is ‘the worst feeling in the world’, says Ellen. ‘He just had to sit there and hopefully somebody would recognize him. [But] we knew if anybody could find his way out of the woods, it would be him,’ she told ABC. Armstrong is suffering from headaches and is more emotional than normal which doctors assure the family are symptoms of a mild concussion. The family celebrated Armstrong's miraculous return with a small pizza party as they rebuild their lives again. More than 60 people including volunteers had been looking for Armstrong in New Hampshire, searching the Stinson Lake area day and night and using helicopters, boats and dogs. By July 31, the search was scaled back to a small crew of about five divers who focused on the lake. 'I really didn't expect this outcome,' said son-in-law Craig Black. 'I'm just glad to have him home.' 'He's very, very resourceful,' said his son-in-law Craig Black. 'He's very strong. He just knows how to survive. He knows how to figure out where he needs to go, how he needs to get there.'

Unexplained death: William Rudloff, 13, shot himself in the head in Sloatsburg, New York on August 2 . A teenage altar boy committed suicide by shooting himself in the head on a quiet village street. Hundreds attended the funeral of 13-year-old William Rudloff on Monday. His distraught mother asked the congregation to focus on how her son had lived and not on his death. Police have closed the investigation into the teenager's death on August 2 which left his small community reeling. William walked out into the street, close to his home in Sloatsburg, New York and fired a gun at his head. He died two days later in Westchester Medical Center, Valhalla. Officials said there was no criminal wrongdoing, calling the death a 'tragedy'. In the two weeks since his death, there has been little information released. It was not known how the 13-year-old got hold of a gun or who it belonged to. William was honored at St Joan of Arc Church as a generous child who gave his birthday money to charity. His mother Gaetana Maiano said: 'William was our rock, our pillar of strength. He loved and cared for everyone.' William's father Mark, who is separated from his mother, was also at the service along with his younger siblings Alison and Andrew and extended family. The teenager was buried at Ascension Cemetery in Airmont. The family asked that donations be made in William's name to his church or St Jude Children's Research Hospital. The shooting earlier this month was witnessed by 20-year-old Victor Sanchez Jr who told lohud.com that he was 50 feet away when he saw the boy raise the gun to his head and fall to the ground.

At the age of seven, Ezekiel Stoddard said he had a calling from God that led him to the pulpit. 'I had a dream,' the boy from Temple Hills Maryland recently told ABC. 'God was telling me that he wanted me to do his will.' Today, at the age of 11, Ezekiel preaches and sings most Sundays before young and old alike at the Fullness of Time in Temple Hills where his parents are both pastors. Scroll down for video . Calling: At the young age of 11, Ezekiel Stoddard is an ordained evangelist in Maryland after reporting a calling from God at the age of seven . He’s the church’s newest addition, having been ordained as an evangelical minister last May by his mother and step-father. 'A lot of grown-ups will look at me like I'm just a joke and I need to sit down,' he told the Washington Post. 'It doesn't matter the age that you can be licensed. It just matters ... how much word do you have and how much God has called you,' he said. Young? Absolutely. Motivated? That too. Talents: The boy who was ordained in May and often preaches on Sundays at his parents' church writes his own sermons and says he is able to speak in tongue and heal people . 'This is something that God called me to . do and that's something that God wants me to do, and this is what I . want to do,' he told ABC. The 11-yer-old affirmed his faith to ABC after questioned whether others, like his mother and father, have put him to it. Ezekiel, who says he writes his own sermons and is gifted by God in his ability to speak in tongue and heal the sick, is not the first preacher to gain attention under the age of 18. One of the most famous child preachers was four-year-old Marjoe Gortner of Southern California who took Pentecostals by storm in the 1950s. Busy: Ezekiel is seen delivering a sermon to a crowd at the Fullness of Time Church in Capital Heights, Maryland, an activity that keeps him busy alongside his musical group God's Blessings No Chains Holding Me Down . It was years later in 1972 he came out in a documentary titled Marjoe admitting that it was all a money-making scheme dreamed up by his parents - his father also a minister - after discovering his talent for mimicry and fearlessness. More similar in terms of youth, other tiny ministers speckle websites like YouTube, with recent four-year-old YouTube star Kanon Tipton seen handed a microphone by his parents in their Mississippi church when he was only 21-months old. Another example could be the Rev Al Sharpton who at the age of four delivered his first sermon in Brooklyn, New York. Others: This 21-month-old boy from Mississippi named Kanon recently took believers by storm after his knack for preaching before his father's congregation . Growing up: Seen last year, Kanon has continued on with his work offering sermons before the congregation . At the age of nine, he became an ordained minister by the Pentecostal church. Today, 48-years later, he's still going strong. Ezekiel's parents say they are getting paid from his preaching and the gospel music he performs but his mother tells ABC her son can stop at any time of his choosing. 'But he will still be taught the word of God still continually,' she said. That much may be shown with Ezekiel's parents surprising him at any time with Bible pop quizzes. While seen singing online with choreographed dancing among his three brothers and sister, his mother says he still has time for things like tennis and taking a trip to the pet store or eating pancakes with his siblings. Booming: Arriving with his parents Pastors Vasconsellas Smith and Adrienne Smith, Ezekiel is seen exiting a chauffeur provided by his father's cousin before performing with his musical group . Sibling band: From left Corinne Stoddard, 15, Hezekiah Stoddard, 13, Micah Stoddard, 7 (far back), and Ezekiel Stoddard, 11, are seen after a performance Ezekiel also preached at . Telling the Post, 'these children are not entertainers or performers. They are music ministers,' she adds her hopes they one day earn a big-time recording contract as she posts their videos on YouTube. Coming together even closer as a family, after students at Ezekiel’s middle school continuously teased and bullied him over his faith and preaching, he and his siblings were pulled out for home schooling instead. His mother Adrienne Smith tells the Post it was because her children weren't learning enough where they were. Speaking of the bullying, Ezekiel told the Post that a lot of his friends dropped him after telling them about Jesus. Childhood: Micah Stoddard, 7, follows behind his brother Ezekiel on scooters outside their home in Temple Hills with his parents affording him time for play . 'A lot of them will say, ""what happened to you? Are you still Ezekiel in there? Are you still Zeek in there?"" he told ABC. 'And I say, ""yes, I am. But I'm different in my spirit."" 'I'm blessed where I am,' he said. 'I know if I stick in the Word, God will bless me for it.' Recently hearing one of the boy's sermons Rev. George Gilbert Jr., assistant pastor at Holy Trinity United Baptist Church spoke with the boy, cautioning to give equal time to his childhood as well. 'God has time for us to be children, and he has time for us to be adults,' Rev Gilbert told him, according to the Post. 'Keep doing what you are doing, but don’t stop being a child.

Pozer, who had the New York Yankee's Derek Jeter as a neighbour, appeared on season two of the hit Bravo series that attempts to match single rich people with potential wives or husbands. During his appearance on the show, Pozer, who is father to two young boys, told the audience that he was the multi-millionaire CEO of Xchange Agent Inc, an online payment service for people in South America. Viewers saw his 33,000 square-foot home set on 26 acres and discovered that despite all his apparent wealth he could not find a wife to share it with. His appearance on the show was not successful after Prozer upset his date Elana by showing off on a jet ski. Michael appeared on the Bravo television show Millionaire Matchmaker. He is pictured here with his date, Elana, which ended in failure. He used the program to bolster the impression he was giving people that he was a millionaire . However, a federal indictment in April of 2010 exposed the fact that Pozer took a loan from the Park Avenue Bank based on fake, non-existent collateral after asking a man named Fedor Salinas, a Wachovia Bank employee, to falsify documents verifying the existence of these funds. Basically, Prozer paid Salinas $25,000 to pretend that he had $21 million in assets and therefore secure a $3 million loan with which he began renting the mansion and joined a scheme to share a private jet. Prozer told the bank, which has now closed down, that he also required operating funds for his business.

Michael Prozer's rented $4 million mansion gave him the facade of wealth . It all fell apart for the conman when he ran out of money and could not transfer one fraudulent scheme to another . Assistant U.S. Attorney Sara Sweeney said that Prozer was a skilled conman and intended to use his appearance on the Bravo show to bolster his front as a millionaire to con more money out of investors. 'That's a pattern we saw again, and again and again,' said Sweeney. 'Everybody trusted Mr. Prozer. He was very good at putting on a facade that he was wealthy.' Sweeney revealed that Prozer had initially tried to scam $18 million from Park Avenue Bank, but dropped this amount because the bank could clear $3 million quicker. Sweeney asked U.S. District Judge Virginia M. Hernandez Covington to impose the maximum sentence under federal guidelines – nine years. In addition, Fedor Salinas was sentenced to 27 months after he too pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail, wire and bank fraud.","Michael Prozer fraudulently scammed $3 million dollars from a provincial bank and appeared on 'Millionaire Matchmaker' boasting he was worth $400 million .

The officers had reportedly noticed a car being driven erratically by a motorist who failed to stop. Santos, from Sao Paulo in Brazil, was picked up by officers close to Arsenal’s training ground in London Colney in Hertfordshire, just inside the M25 motorway, last Friday morning. The next day, the father of one was on the substitutes' bench for Arsenal's first match of the season against Sunderland at the Emirates Stadium. The Sun newspaper reported that a car was driven for several miles at speeds of up to 130mph. Santos, who joined Arsenal last year from Turkish club Fenerbahce, could be jailed if found guilty of dangerous driving. A police source told the Sun: 'The allegation is that he was travelling at speeds up to 130 mph. 'Further enquiries are ongoing to verify the speed using on-board police cameras and technical equipment.' Bailed: Santos was arrested by officers only a couple of miles from his club's training ground . A witness who saw the footballer after he was stopped told the newspaper: 'Two police cars were there and two or three officers were talking to the driver.' A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Shortly after 9.30am on Friday August 17, a 29-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and failing to stop for police on the A1, near to Junction 22 of the M25. 'Officers’ attention was drawn to the vehicle due to the manner of its driving. 'The man has been bailed to return at a date in mid-September to a North London police station.' The man was not breathalysed, police added. Powerful: Santos is believed to have been driving a Maserati GranTurismo supercar like the one in this picture .

One of Princess Diana's closest friends has defended Prince Harry's naked Las Vegas antics by insisting he has done nothing 'wrong or immoral'. As nude photographs of the prince made headlines around the world, Rosa Monckton said that Harry's mother had always believed in the distinction between her public and private life. Ms Monckton told the Evening Standard: 'The same distinction should apply to her sons, both of whom are serving their country. 'He is first and foremost a soldier. He has served one tour in Afghanistan and will be returning. 'Young men in that situation always have it in the back of their minds that they may not come home. The second tour of duty is much harder than the first. So they party. 'He isn’t married. He has the absolute right to privacy in his private time. He hasn’t done anything wrong or immoral.' Ms Monckton posted a message of support for 'top ging' Harry on her Twitter page, including a picture bearing the message: 'Sometimes you just have to pick yourself up and carry on. The pictures of the naked royal with an unidentified naked woman in a Las Vegas hotel suite, first revealed to the world on U.S. celebrity gossip site TMZ, have not been published in the British press. To see the pictures, the public has had to access TMZ, or scores of other internet pages across the globe carrying the images. Although the incident is embarrassing . for Harry, who is due to embark on the next phase of his military . career, he will not face repercussions from army bosses. The Ministry of Defence confirmed to the Evening Standard that military officials will not take action against the young royal. An official said: 'Since this all happened in private and was not against the law, it is not a breach of military discipline.' Today a leading lawyer said that editors are respecting past rulings on privacy and their own press watchdog by not publishing the candid pictures. British newspapers complied with a request from St James's Palace, made via the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), to respect Harry's privacy and not use the images as they were taken in a private hotel room. Media commentators said the newspapers have been 'neutered' by Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry into media ethics. But media lawyer Mark Stephens said editors realised they had to comply with the wishes of St James's Palace: ""It's because they were asked not to by the PCC and they accepted it was probably the better way to go. Harry was also pictured preparing to race Olympic swimmer and gold medallist Ryan Lochte, in the white t-shirt, in a Las Vegas swimming pool . Surrounded by partygoers, the prince and Lochte were pictured discussing their race . 'We have seen many examples, going right back to Mrs Simpson when she was being courted by the former king (Edward VIII), when the British press declined to publish a story that was widely available. 'What we have is a story running on social media which the reasonable media here haven't taken up.' He added that a number of high profile court cases involving celebrities had changed the way the press handle privacy. 'The courts have said for a long time that photographs are more intrusive (than words), like the Jamie Theakston case,"" said Mr Stephens. In 2002 a judge allowed a Sunday newspaper to publish the details, but not the photographs, of Theakston visiting a prostitute in a Mayfair vice club. Mr Stephens said: 'We don't need to see the pictures, they are gratuitous. It's for that reason they stay away from it.' Former News of the World executive editor Neil Wallis said he would have published the photos before the inquiry into media ethics began, and the Leveson hearings had ""neutered"" the press. He told BBC's Newsnight: 'The situation is fun, it's a good, classic newspaper situation. The problem is, in this post-Leveson era where newspapers are simply terrified of their own shadow, they daren't do things that most of the country, if they saw it in the newspaper, would think ""that's a bit of a laugh"".' One non-mainstream British website to publish the pictures was the Guido Fawkes political blog. Harry was pictured wearing a top borrowed from a female partygoer in a Las Vegas pool . As the revealing photographs hit the internet, Harry was spotted in Los Angeles ahead of a flight back to Britain . And the Sun also broke ranks, splashing on the story by creating a mock-up of one of the images with naked staff posing as Harry and the woman. The prince is back in the UK and is not expected to attend the opening of the Paralympics next week but is likely to attend some of the events to support the country's disabled athletes if his military duties allow. A PCC spokesman confirmed that St James's Palace had contacted the organisation so the regulatory body could raise the Palace's concerns with editors. He said it was a procedure open to all members of the public: 'There wasn't a formal complaint, this is a system available to people at the heart of a news story who feel the Editors' Code of Practice is likely to be breached. 'They thought Prince Harry had a reasonable right to privacy, being in a private hotel.' TMZ said the photos were taken last Friday after the prince and his entourage met some women in a hotel bar and invited them up to the royal's suite. The group played a stripping game and someone in the party is thought to have captured the image of the naked prince on a camera phone. In the first photograph, the royal is shown wearing just a necklace and a wristband with his hands around his genitals as a seemingly topless woman stands close behind him. The nude prince is shown in another picture shielding himself behind an unknown woman who is also naked, with his bare bottom facing the camera. But there is no suggestion that anything other than horseplay is going on between the royal and the unnamed woman. A source said the prince was just 'letting off steam' before the next important phase of his military career. The pictures are the latest gaffe by the prince, whose past indiscretions include smoking cannabis as a teenager, being photographed in a Nazi uniform at a fancy dress party, and scuffling outside a nightclub with a photographer. A number of the prince's charities have refused to comment about the pictures.","Rosa Monckton tells Evening Standard: 'He isn't married. He has the absolute right to privacy in his private time.'

But one village is so incensed by the inconvenience of having their road closed they have allegedly taken to heaping verbal abuse and threats on to the contractors trying to improve their street. The residents of genteel village Chestfield, in Kent, have screamed, sworn and challenged workers to fights, the contractors claim. Dave Pullen, 47, one of the sub-contractors fitting underground water pipes says wealthy locals have branded him and his co-workers t***s, lazy w****** and a*******s and shrieked at them on 60 different occasions. 'Threatened for doing their job': Dave Pullen says that the villages have hurled abuse at him and his co-workers . Now the sub-contractor says the abuse he and his colleagues have received from villagers in is so awful he is now considering quitting after 27 years on the job. He said one irate villager, furious about having to drive around the closed road, screamed: 'You should get your f***ing fingers out and do your jobs you a*******s' Another well-spoken man in his fifties, wearing an 'expensive grey suit,' even challenged Mr Pullen to a fight because he was so angry about the road closure, he says. But the employees, who work for Clancy Docwra, which are contracted by South East Water to carry out the work, are actually on course to complete the pipe works ahead of schedule. The father-of-three, who has worked across the UK, now says he would rather work in crime-riddled areas in London, rather than on the leafy streets of Kent. Chestfield is an exclusive commuter village, just an hour-and-a-half from London, near the north Kent coast, filled with huge detached houses, which sell for up to £1 million. Mr Pullen, who lives in Medway, Kent, . with his wife Deborah, 44, said: 'I'm no shrinking violet and I've . worked all over the place, including in Brixton and Peckham, where there . was usually a stabbing every day. 'But I'd rather work there than Chestfield. Fury: The road closure has prompted a backlash from local residents, the sub-contractors claim . 'The abuse has been unbelievable and I have been shocked, not only at the swear words, but at the aggression as well. 'It's not from youngsters either - the worst has come from middle-aged people. 'It is a very wealthy area but that does not stop them. Some of them must be millionaires. 'Some of them seem to think that because they have a bit of money they have a God-given right to treat people like this. 'It has been pretty bad and unrelenting, but it came to a head on Friday when a woman came along and clicked her fingers in front of my face and a man came up and started egging me on to hit him. 'They know we can't do anything and can't defend ourselves and just have to take it. 'It was so bad we were at the point of walking off the site. I have never felt like that in 27 years of doing this job.' Mr . Pullen said the abuse started on the day they set up three weeks ago, . even though locals had been told well in advance about the work and the . road closure. The work, . which forced the closure of Chestfield Road in the centre of the town, . is scheduled to be finished on Monday but the company hopes to have the . work completed by Saturday. Mr . Pullen says he and his team have been starting work on the site at . 7.30am and carrying on until 8pm or 9pm including at weekends, to get . the work finished as soon as possible. Grief: Residents from Chestfield, Kent, have tried to drive through the barriers, the road workers claim . But some residents have accused the workmen of taking too long to complete the works. One lady demanded the workers finish the updates in just 24 hours to stop her being inconvenienced, Mr Pullen claimed and another neighbour has allegedly been spotted filming the team every time they stop for a break. There have also been claims from Mr Pullen's company's employers South East Water that drivers have been trying to force their cars through the road works. Mr Pullen added: 'One woman asked why I couldn't work 24 hours a day to finish faster and another woman took photos of us every time we stopped for a break. 'The residents right by where we are working, where all the noise is, have been fine. It is a few people who live further away who have been the worst. 'They have sworn at us and come out with patronising comments. 'We have been polite and answered their questions. It has been absolutely shocking and all we are trying to do is improve their water supply. 'They have tried to drive their cars down the verge to get by because they don't want to go a longer way round. 'I love my job but for the first time ever I have dreaded going to work. 'In these situations all we can do is appeal to people's better nature, but there are a bunch of people in Chestfield Road who don't appear to have a better nature. 'We are due to finish this job on Monday but, barring bad weather, we should finish on Saturday. 'I can't wait. I am thinking of having a party when I get off this site. I don't want to do another job in Chestfield ever again.' Mr Pullen is a sub contractor for Clancy Docwra, who have been replacing underground water pipes for South East Water. The current road works have forced the closer of Chestfield Road and a divert has been put in the place. Graham Webb, Delivery Manager at South East Water said: 'Since the road closure came in drivers have been trying to force their ways through the barriers. 'This not only puts the lives of our contractors at risk, but also other motorists and pedestrians too. 'On top of this, the gang on site has been subjected to a stream of verbal abuse. This kind of behaviour is disgraceful and wholly unacceptable. 'The construction workers are doing a great job to make sure that people in the area have a constant supply of clean drinking water and they should not have to put up with this. 'The road closure has been agreed with Kent Highway Services. 'I strongly urge motorists and passers-by to please respect the traffic management and follow the diversion signs. 'The short term pain of a road closure will be far outweighed by the benefits that this new pipeline will bring to the area for many years to come.'","Sub-contractors say they have been screamed at and threatened on at least sixty different occasions .

The Taliban beheaded 17 people in a remote corner of southern Afghanistan – apparently for attending a party. Two of the victims were women and all were described as ‘civilians’. Local officials said they were killed because they were at a music event, were dancing and both sexes were present, all of which are against Taliban law. Slaughter: 17 civilians including two women were beheaded by the Taliban in Afghanistan for taking . part in a village music festival. Pictured: Musa Quala . district where the killings took place . However, other reports claimed that . those who died – who may have been shot before being decapitated – were . victims of a crackdown on government informers, or even that they were . killed as a result of two Taliban leaders arguing over the women. The executions were carried out on Sunday night in Helmand province’s Musa Qala district in an area controlled by the Taliban. District government chief . Neyamatullah Khan said the victims were part of a large group that had . gathered for a celebration involving music and dancing. He said the Taliban slaughtered them . to show their disapproval of the event and added that information was . trickling out only slowly because the area is completely under the . Taliban’s control. However, his version was disputed by a . Helmand police official who said there was a possibility that those who . were killed were suspected of being informants. Yet another offical put the killings . down to a dispute between two Taliban leaders. Afghan President Hamid . Karzai condemned the atrocity and said the killings were against Sharia . law. ‘The killing of innocent civilians by the Taliban is an unforgivable crime,’ he said. The Musa Qala district of . Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan is an area said to be completely . under the control of insurgents . However, the Taliban denied that they were involved. Spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi said: . ‘No Taliban have killed any civilians. Neither were Taliban commanders . fighting each other. We don’t know about this thing. Whether it happened . or not, we were not involved.’ The deaths contradict the Taliban . leadership’s orders for their fighters to avoid killing ordinary . Afghans, suggesting a breakdown in discipline and a further fracturing . of the insurgency. Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar . urged his commanders earlier this month to ‘employ tactics that do not . cause harm to the life and property of the common countrymen’. The insurgents’ supreme leader has . issued such edicts from hiding before, perhaps trying to soften the . extremist movement’s image, but the order appears to have been widely . ignored. A UN report last month said 1,145 . civilians were killed and 1,954 others were injured in the first half of . the year, 80 per cent of them by militants. In fact, while the Taliban seek to . soften their image, the beheadings recall the days of public executions . during their rule in the five years before the US-led invasion in . October 2001. British soldiers are seen on patrol in Musa Qala in 2007. In a separate incident 10 Afghan soldiers were killed and two Nato troops shot dead in what has been described as an 'insider attack' The deaths heralded a violent 24 . hours in Afghanistan. More than 200 insurgents took part in an attack on . a checkpoint in the same region yesterday in which ten Afghan soldiers . were killed and six more seized. There are fears that the Taliban will . again control southern Afghanistan and impose their strict . interpretation of Islamic law on the region as foreign troops gradually . withdraw in the next two years. Nearly all foreign troops are to . leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014 and the US-led Nato coalition hopes . that Afghan security forces will be strong enough to take control. As . the drawdown progresses, there has been a surge in attacks by Afghan . forces against their allies. An Afghan soldier killed two US . troops in eastern Afghanistan’s Laghman province yesterday, bringing to . 12 the number of foreign soldiers who have died this month. The Afghan soldier is said to have . used a rocket-propelled grenade and was himself killed as he fled by . forces called in by the Americans to help deal with an attack by . insurgents. The chief spokesman for Nato forces in . Afghanistan said coalition forces were not pulling back from . collaborating with the Afghans despite such incidents.","Local officials said they were killed because they were at a music event, which is against Taliban law .

Disturbing footage has been uncovered of two teenagers surfing on the back of a moving bus through a busy city centre. At one point a rider is shown tumbling off the vehicle in Perth, Scotland, and could have easily fallen under the wheels or in front of another car. Furious safety campaigners fear a spurt of copycat attempts and want the 'dangerous and foolish' video banned. Scroll down for video . Uproar: Footage of these two young boys shows them on the back of a moving bus in Perth, Scotland . Slip: The film shows the left teen at the moment he lost his grip of the bus and seems to be suspended in mid-air before crashing to the floor . Tumble: The one remaining rider looks down to his left as his friend is seen in a heap on the floor close to the rear left tyre after falling off the back . The footage was apparently filmed for 'comedy' Facebook page Perth Memes. Although the fallen boy managed to narrowly escape injury, safety charity RoSPA Scotland has branded the actions of the young people involved disgraceful. Worryingly the video has already been 'liked' by more than 700 Facebook users and shared by almost 100 people so far. Kathleen Braidwood, road safety officer with RoSPA, said the boys’ behaviour could have resulted in a serious accident. Brainless: The two boys are shown here as they jumped on the bus in Perth . 'We would encourage teenagers not to give into peer pressure by copying this behaviour,' she said. Donald Pover, community safety convener on Perth and Kinross Council, described the footage as a display of 'utter stupidity'. 'Not only are these youths putting their own lives at risk, they are also putting other road users in danger,' he said. 'The people involved might have seen this as a bit of fun, but it could very easily have had tragic consequences.' Holding on: After his pal fell off the other teen stayed on down the hill . End: As the bus approaches a junction the boy jumps off, incredibly not having been injured . A spokesman for Stagecoach Perth, who run the bus service, said the footage was 'very worrying'. 'This is a very dangerous activity where those involved are putting themselves, as well as other road users, at risk,' he added.

"By . Peter Allen In Paris . PUBLISHED: . 07:03 EST, 30 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:26 EST, 31 August 2012 . Nicolas Sarkozy is contemplating a £200,000-an-hour job with banking giant Morgan Stanley. If the former French president accepts the job with Morgan Stanley he will be following a similarly lucrative path to the one trodden by his old friend and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who earns millions in his role as an advisor to investment bank JP Morgan. But critics on the other side of the Channel have already expressed disgust at once-elected politicians effectively using their reputations to enrich themselves to the tune of millions. Lucrative: Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, left, is said to be mulling over an offer from Morgan Stanley. Tony Blair, the former British Prime Minister, right, has amassed a fortune since he left the post in 2007 . Since quitting as PM in 2007, Mr Blair has bought at least six homes, travels the world by private jet, and has an income of at least £20 million a year. Around £2.5 million of that comes from his role as an advisor to the U.S. investment bank JP Morgan. Leisure time: Sarkozy was pictured on holiday in Cap Negre in the south of France earlier this month . According to the French investigative weekly Le Canard Enchaine, Morgan Stanley has offered Mr Sarkozy a quarter of a million euros for one hour's work. He will be expected to make a speech of 45 minutes and then pose for pictures for a further 15. The controversial Mr Sarkozy is currently facing a number of corruption allegations in France, including claims that he accepted illegal cash payments from Lilian Bettencourt, the l'Oreal heiress and France's richest woman. But the conservative politician's five years spent running France are considered of huge interest to international companies, and Mr Sarkozy is in a good position to exploit this. The offer from Morgan Stanley is far . more than the £17,000 odd a month he earned as President, but it . is still a lot less than the fees Mr Blair can command. Referring . to Mr Sarkozy, French agent Nicolas Teil, said: 'As a head hunter I can . see why a company would spend so much money for (Mr Sarkozy's) economic . expertise.' But Mr . Teil added: 'This is a very taboo subject in France at the moment. You . will never get a former president boasting of having sold his services . to a company as it would offend public opinion.' Mr Blair has regularly been accused of abusing his former position to make massive profits. He . also runs a financial advisory service, Tony Blair Associates, which . has deals with the oil and gas-rich governments of Kazakhstan and Kuwait . and sovereign wealth funds in China and Abu Dhabi. Before . the murder of Colonel Gaddafi during the Arab Spring, Mr Blair . regularly met the dictator in Libya, and advised companies on how to . make money in the oil-rich country. Mr . Blair, who speaks French, has been a frequent visitor to Paris over the . years, both officially and as a friend of Mr Sarkozy's. Neither have commented on the claims in the latest edition of Le Candard Enchaine .
