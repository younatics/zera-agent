When Molly Anne Dutton was crowned homecoming queen last week her adopted mother Peggy was by her side. But it was her birth mother, who made the decision to continue with her pregnancy after being the victim of rape, who inspired Molly to put herself forward to be Auburn University's 100th Miss Homecoming. Alabama adoption charity Lifeline Children's Services helped Molly's biological mother continue her pregnancy after her husband ordered her to get an abortion or face divorce. Scroll down for video . Tears of joy: Molly Anne Dutton is hugged by her adopted mother Peggy after being named homecoming queen . Radiant: Molly Anne's homecoming platform was adoption, to celebrate the chance she had at life . 'Because that resource was made . available to my mother, she decided to give birth to me, and here I am . 22 years later,' Molly proudly said. The horticultural student dedicated her homecoming platform to the adoption charity under her Light Up Life campaign that quickly found support on campus. 'It was an easy decision,'; Molly said of her adoption advocacy platform. 'However, it wasn't an obvious decision.' The 22-year-old had initially wanted to work towards a plant-based cause or campaign against human trafficking. But as she discussed ideas with friends over lunch, one of them suggested that she should advocate a cause that had impacted her directly. Second chance: Light Up Life helped Molly's mother continue with her pregnancy and find a loving family for her daughter . Celebration: Molly tried to make her campaign fun, saying she was concerned about the stigma associated with her story . 'One of the girls said, ""Molly, what do you think about sharing your story"",' she said. 'I had shared it with a smaller audience. I am honored to carry that story.' Her interview panel were equally moved by her story, as were the 25,000 students on Auburn's campus. For a week, Molly's team distributed yellow daisies and sold green and yellow T-shirts across campus, with proceeds going to Lifeline Children's Services. The charity had helped arrange her adoption and Molly said she grew up in a loving home, the youngest of six children, four of whom had been adopted. Her team campaigned for her under the slogan Light Up Life, as Molly pushed her platform of adoption. 'We had to think of a way to gain momentum and get other students invested,' John Canada, who helped Molly campaign, said. 'The only answer we could think of to do that was simply tell her story and celebrate how radiant life is,' he added. As Molly's story captured the attention of her fellow students, donations started flowing in for Lifeline. 'That has just rippled out,' she said. 'That's been the biggest [change], to know that it's not just students who know my story, but men and women across the nation.' Delight: Peggy Dutton cries and cheers as the youngest of her six children is crowned homecoming queen . Molly said she was comfortable sharing her story but hadn't been prepared for the way it encouraged other students to share personal details about their lives. 'It was a very emotional time. Vulnerability breeds vulnerability,' she said. 'That was a very special part of the week.' She told Fox News and Friends that finding a way to tell her story had been difficult, but her and her friends wanted to get across the message that life is radiant. 'We knew there was a lot of stigma. Sexual assault or abortion carry negative stigma,' she said. 'We wanted to make [the campaign] fun and to know that life is so light and radiant.' Unlike many Miss Homecoming candidates, Molly ran without the support of a sorority or other large organization. She was funded by a club within the horticulture department, the Professional Landcare Network and said the small department has been supportive of her campaign. 'I went to class and I did get a ""Congratulations"" from my professor, which was awesome,' Molly said. Now that her whirlwind campaign is over, Molly is looking forward to carrying out her Miss Homecoming duties, which includes acting as a liaison between university students and alumni. Proud: Peggy kisses Molly, who campaigned for the adoption charity that placed her with the Dutton family . 'It wasn't ever running against; it was running with four other girls,' Molly said of her campaign. 'Every day last week, when I put my head on the pillow, I just felt so accomplished.' She added that she was 'full of gratitude' for the Auburn student body that supported her platform and her personal experience with adoption. '[I was given grace to carry that story,' she said. 'My story is a voice for the voiceless.'","Auburn University student shares emotional journey to raise awareness for charity and celebrate her life .

"By . Paul Bentley . PUBLISHED: . 16:09 EST, 18 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:51 EST, 18 October 2013 . He's clearly a sharp dresser with his own distinct style. And if you heard him speak, his cockney accent would be as broad as the River Thames. This is Derek Hockley, the wheeler-dealer who David Jason has revealed he took as his inspiration when playing Del Boy in Only Fools and Horses. As well as draping himself in gold jewellery and wearing a camel-hair coat, Mr Hockley regularly told his family ‘we’re going to be millionaires’ and had the swagger of an ‘I’m-a-Mr-Someone-Special’. Inspiration: Derek Hockley, left, gave David Jason the pattern for his inspiration in playing Derek Trotter, right, and he picked up on many of Hockley's mannerisms, and imitated his dress sense . Sir David first met Mr Hockley when he was working as an electrician on a building site almost 20 years before the hit show was created by writer John Sullivan. Pictures from the 1950s released to the Mail by Mr Hockley’s daughter Jan Wilson show just how true Del Boy was to her father. Sir David imitated not just his sense of style, but also his accent, mannerisms and catchphrases. The actor has told that he was initially suggested for the part of Granddad in Only Fools and Horses, but insisted on auditioning to play Derek Trotter after reading the script and thinking: ‘I know this man.’ In his book My Life, Sir David wrote: ‘Right there in my flat as I read [the script], I was spun back to the days going round to builders’ yards and literally knocking on the door in search of electrical work. 'In the East End of London we had happened on a contractor called Derek Hockley – a real East End player in a camel-hair coat, with immaculately greased hair and sharp clothing. ‘He had a cockney accent you could have rolled up and beaten someone over the head with, and a habit of bringing his top lip slightly forward and flexing his neck as if trying to get the collar of his shirt to settle down. Family Ties: Mr Hockley's daughter Jan Wilson, pictured with her father (left) and now (right) provided the Mail with pictures of her father and explained how he always had his eye on being a millionaire, just like Del Boy . Wheeler-dealer: Mr Hockley, like Del Boy, was always on the look-out for a way to make money . ‘I could hear Derek Hockley’s voice and see his manner as clear as day in the character on the typewritten pages in front of me.’ While renovating properties during the day and selling on old furniture at night, Mr Hockley would insist on being impeccably presented at all times. And it seems the Trotters’ yellow three-wheeled Reliant Regal could have been inspired by the bright yellow Austin Healey Sprite Mr Hockley surprised his wife Joyce with. While the scriptwriters thought Del Boy – who lived in Peckham, South East London –  should be scruffy and have a fat belly, Sir David resisted. ‘I pressed hard for taking him in the direction of Derek Hockley – this cockney who dressed like a fashion model but spoke like a docker,’ he wrote. ‘Derek Hockley became the image I took for Derek Trotter.’ Sir David owed much to Mr Hockley, who gave him a lot of work as an electrician and much-needed cash when he was a struggling young part-time actor. He was concerned that being associated with Del Boy ‘had upset him or even ruined the poor bloke’s life’ but Mr Hockley’s daughter wrote to assure him her father was delighted with the imitation. Mrs Wilson, 65, who lives in Spain with her husband Richard, used to run a bar called  Del Boy’s in Torrevieja on the Costa Blanca in memory of her father. Memorial: Mrs Wilson poses in her backgarden bar, named Del Boy's II in honour of her father . Her father remained close to Sir David, who visited him when he was dying in hospital to show him an award he had won playing Del Boy. Mr Hockley grew up in Newham, East London, and served in the Army in the Second World War as a caterer. He married Joyce in 1945 in his uniform. They had two daughters, Jan and Julia, before they separated when the girls were in their teens. ‘David Jason would always say to Rodney, “This time next year, we’ll be millionaires!” and my dad always used to say the same – “We’re going to be millionaires!”,’ said Mrs Wilson. ‘He worked very hard and he did quite a lot of wheeling and dealing. He wasn’t doing anything bad. Relationship: David Jason remained in touch with Mr Hockley. Mrs Wilson poses here with a later from Sir David to her father. ‘He would buy up old properties and renovate them. If the people said “just clear everything out” he would keep some of it and sell off the rest. ‘He would always come up with something, an antique, some sort of bargain.’ Mrs Wilson said Mr Hockley’s flamboyant dress sense was something that ran in his family. ‘He had this camel-haired coat, which he would walk onto the building site with. With gold, he loved gold: The necklace; the rings. ‘His mother and father were very well dressed. Nanny used to have a chest of drawers with silk clothes in them and lovely jewellery. Loads of beads. They were all very well dressed. It’s a family thing. ’ Above all, Mr Hockley, like Del Boy, is said to have had a big heart and a wicked sense of humour. ‘When they laid dad out, he wanted to be in his cravat and his suit. It was a red cravat because he always wore very loud clothes,’ Mrs  Wilson added.","Derek Hockley gave David Jason work when he was an East End electrician .

David Cameron will this week launch a YouTube attack on Ed Miliband and Ed Balls - branding them 'Mystic Ed And His Crystal Balls' for falsely predicting Britain's economic slump would get worse. Headlined 'Mystic Ed, The World's Worst Clairvoyant,' the internet  cartoon film is designed to convince voters the Labour leader and Shadow Chancellor were wrong to denounce the Coalition's 'austerity Britain' policies. Tory chiefs hope the spoof advertising campaign on the video-sharing website will be widely circulated. Devised by Conservative HQ, its release comes just days before new figures are published this week that are expected to show the economy is continuing to grow. Last week, other figures showed a drop in the number out of work. Internet cartoon film is headlined 'Mystic Ed, The World's Worst Clairvoyant' But the 'Mystic Ed' video triggered an angry response from Labour. Told of the Tory campaign, a Labour insider said last night: 'Puerile attacks like this are an insult to the millions of people who are struggling to make ends meet.' It marks the unofficial start of the campaign for the next Election, not due until May 2015, when the economy is likely to be the deciding factor. Mr Cameron is convinced the economic recovery will help him win and that Labour is on the back foot. Labour believes its pledge to freeze energy bills has showed the Tories are vulnerable to claims that they have not curbed the cost of living. The 'Mystic Ed' film is the  most aggressive Tory publicity attack on Labour since Mr Miliband became Labour leader  in 2010, though not the first time such a campaign has sparked  controversy. In the pre-YouTube 1997 Election, Labour produced posters portraying Tory Prime Minister John Major as 'Mr Dither', based on the Mr Men children's cartoon books, but the idea was vetoed by the series author Roger Hargreaves. The Tories hit back by producing notorious 'Demon Eyes' posters featuring Tony Blair in an attempt to suggest that, behind his smile, he was a dangerous Left-winger. Mr Blair won by a landslide. When William Hague succeeded Mr Major, a Labour campaign in the 2001 Election featured Mr Hague with a Margaret Thatcher-style blonde wig superimposed on his bald head - to suggest he shared her outdated views. Mr Hague lost by a landslide. A Labour poster in the 2010 Election portrayed Mr Cameron as TV detective Gene Hunt, played by actor Philip Glenister in the Life On Mars series, but it backfired spectacularly. It showed Mr Cameron sitting on the bonnet of Hunt's trademark Audi Quattro with the slogan: 'Don't let him take Britain back to the 1980s.' It was intended to link the Tories to the social unrest of that period. But Mr Cameron said he was 'flattered' to be compared to Hunt and adopted the image, replacing the slogan with: 'Fire up the Quattro. It's time for change.' David Cameron will this week launch a YouTube attack on Ed Miliband and Ed Balls . The Tory YouTube film will feature economic forecasts made by Mr Miliband and Mr Balls and claim that they have repeatedly not been borne out by events. In one comment highlighted by the Tories, Mr Miliband said in October 2010: 'They have a programme which will clearly lead to the disappearance of...a million jobs.' The video says 1.4 million private sector jobs have been created since 2010. It also refers to a letter to Chief Secretary Danny Alexander from Mr Balls in September, 2010, in which he warned of a 'double dip recession' caused by Government cuts. The film says neither claim turned out to be true. A Conservative spokesman said: 'Ed Miliband constantly tries to say the country faces disaster under our economic policies - only to be proved wrong time and again. We can make one prediction - if Labour's plan for more spending, borrowing and debt were to be enacted, we really would be in trouble.'","Tory chiefs this week launch a YouTube attack on Ed Miliband and Ed Balls .

Natalie Rowe makes claims about George Osborne's youth in her new book Chief Whip which is due out later this month . A former dominatrix who claims to have been close friends with George Osborne says she watched him fight with her boyfriend after she licked his ear. Natalie Rowe, who used to be known as 'Mistress Pain', says the the Chancellor became involved in a 'tussle' with her then-boyfriend William Sinclair in her flat opposite Kensington Palace. George Osborne strongly denies all the allegations against him. Speaking about her and Osborne's close relationship in the Sunday People, Rowe says Sinclair - a former drug addict and crack cocaine user - had become enraged after watching her lick Osborne's ear. In her new book, Chief Whip, Rowe says: 'They started tussling with each other. As I leapt out of the way the sofa tipped over and they rolled out on to the floor, still fighting. 'It was the hugging-and-rolling kind of fight, rather than punching-and-kicking. I thought it was hilarious. I told them, ""Come on, stop it, this is ridiculous!"" By the time they’d calmed down and made up, nobody had thrown a punch.' She says the fight happened at an all-night party at her flat in the early 1990s where guests took cocaine and ecstasy and paid for sex with prostitutes, although it is not suggested Osborne was involved in either. Discussing the parties, Natalie adds: 'Thirty or 40 people would come. At this time Thatcherism was triumphant. There was so much money around and the bars and clubs were full of energy. 'These were golden years for hookers. Even the recession didn’t slow things down. The crowd I hung around with certainly didn’t care about anyone who was suffering economic hardship. They were unscathed.' Rowe also claims that Osborne, Sinclair, and another friend Christopher Coleridge - descendant of poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge - hung around her flat while she was with clients, sometimes even talking to them when they were finished. When Miss Rowe met Mr Osborne, she was dating Sinclair, a member of one of the country’s biggest landowning families. He and the future Chancellor were members of Oxford University’s Bullingdon Club, a male-only institution with a reputation for heavy drinking and riotous behaviour. George Osborne strongly denies any wrongdoing and says he met Natalie occasionally during 1993 . Miss Rowe has previously claimed that Mr Osborne knew that she had an escort agency and once discovered whips and sex toys in her apartment. She said he had 'found it quite amusing.’ Last week Rowe had her home raided by police weeks before the release of the new book. Up to 12 drugs squad officers searched Natalie Rowe's flat for two hours but found nothing. Miss Rowe, who once used the name 'Miss Whiplash' claimed it was an attempt to smear her ahead of the book's publication, though Osborne has denied any involvement in the raid. Eight years ago a picture of George Osborne sitting next to Rowe appeared, next to a line of what appeared to be cocaine. She said the party was held to celebrate her becoming pregnant by Mr Sinclair. She added: ‘It was definitely cocaine on the table. ‘I remember vividly on that particular night I said to George, jokingly, ""When you are prime minister one day I will have all the dirty goods on you"" and he laughed. Although the picture was taken before Mr Osborne entered politics, it was published when he had taken centre stage in the Conservative party as shadow chancellor. His response was to deny that there was cocaine on the table and insisted that any suggestion that he took drugs was 'defamatory and completely untrue.' A previous statement by Osborne said: 'A friend of mine went out with a woman called Natalie and they had a child together. I met them occasionally in the autumn of 1993 and it soon became clear my friend had started to use drugs. 'He became more and more addicted and I saw his life fall apart. With his other friends I tried to persuade him to seek treatment. 'After rehabilitation he has now recovered and put his life back together.'","Natalie Rowe - aka Mistress Pain - is releasing a new book .

Missing: Madeleine McCann was last seen in a flat in the Algarve in May 2007 and is the subject of a global police search . Police have identified a new suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann and are set to release an 'e-fit' photograph of him, it was claimed today. Officials apparently hope the photograph will enable them to track the man down, more than six years after Madeleine went missing from a flat in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz. Sky News reported that the picture is set to be released by the Metropolitan Police, which has taken over the investigation into the girl's disappearance from Portuguese police. The man was apparently seen near the flat around the time that Madeleine, then aged three, disappeared while her parents Kate and Gerry were dining at a nearby restaurant in May 2007. Scotland Yard today refused to confirm or . deny the claims, saying that it was planning 'a series of public . appeals' in a variety of countries. A police statement said: 'We are not prepared to discuss, comment or speculate on the content of the upcoming appeal in relation to the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. 'This has been weeks in the planning and each element of the investigation must be set into the overall context of the appeal. 'We will be asking for help from the public in a number of countries, delivered through a series of public appeals. 'We will do nothing to jeopardise the effectiveness of these appeals and we have repeatedly stated that media speculation can be damaging to our efforts. 'The MPS will release the relevant material at the relevant time.' Parents: Kate and Gerry McCann are currently suing a disgraced Portuguese police chief . The image will be released within a few days and will form part of the new push to find Madeleine, according to Sky News. The possible breakthrough has apparently . been warmly received by the McCanns, who are confident that the search . for their daughter is progressing. However, police are currently unsure how the man might be connected to the case and are appealing for more witnesses to come forward. British detectives launched a fresh investigation in July this year - two years into a review of the case - and a BBC Crimewatch appeal on the case is to be aired on Monday. The appeal will include a reconstruction . of the 'latest, most detailed understanding' of the events around the . time Madeleine went missing. Aged: This image of how Madeleine might look now was released by police last year . Scotland Yard has revealed a comprehensive record log of mobile phone traffic could be the key to finding out what happened to the girl. Madeleine's parents have said they remain 'optimistic' of finding their daughter and will not accept she is dead until they are presented with clear evidence. The Metropolitan Police now has a team of six Portuguese detectives based in Faro who are carrying out inquiries on its behalf. Several e-fits of possible suspects have emerged since Madeleine's disappearance - including one, dubbed the 'egg with hair', which sparked ridicule because of its lack of facial features. Police refused to release the picture to the public, citing strict Portuguese laws covering investigations, but those who saw it were convinced that it was completely useless. In January 2008 the McCanns' team released an artist's impression of an olive-skinned man with straggly, collar-length hair and a drooping moustache based on a statement given by a British holidaymaker. Court case: Gerry McCann pictured in Lisbon outside the libel trial of former police chief Goncalo Amaral . In July 2008 Portuguese authorities . shelved their investigation into Madeleine's disappearance, and the next . month thousands of pages from the official police files were released. The . documents included computer-generated e-fits of two suspicious men seen . around Praia da Luz before Madeleine went missing which were never made . public by detectives. The McCanns are currently suing former Portuguese police chief Goncalo Amaral for libel after he claimed that they were responsible for their daughter's disappearance. Both Kate and Gerry McCann have asked to give evidence in the trial in Lisbon over the policeman's book, The Truth of the Lie. The couple say Amaral's allegations that they hid Madeleine's body after she died in an accident, then faked her abduction, damaged the hunt for the girl and exacerbated their grief.","E-fit photograph of man 'will be released to public within a few days'

A minor crab bite has left a . 77-year-old Florida man fighting for his life after he was infected with . the flesh-eating virus that claimed its ninth victim over the weekend. George . Clarke, of Yulee, was out crabbing Saturday night in Nassau County at the . Georgia-Florida state line when a crustacean snapped at him, infecting . the elderly man with Vibrio vulnificus. So far, 27 cases of the flesh-eating infection have been confirmed in Florida this year, nine of them fatal. George Clarke, 77, of Yulee, was infected after . being pinched by a crab. This is Clarke's arm. Since this photo was . taken the bacteria has eaten away all of the swollen skin pictured, . according to his family. Case No. 27: George Clarke, 77, contracted a potentially deadly infection caused by the Vibrio vulnificus bacteria . (pictured), which so far this year has affected 26 people, killing nine of them . The latest victim of the outbreak was . identified this week as Henry Konietzky, 59, who passed away from the . infection just over a day after he went crabbing in Halifax River in Volusia . County Saturday. News of . the latest incident involving the deadly bacteria was first reported by . the Orlando Sentinel, which recieved a call from Mr Clarke’s grandson . Bob Karstetter, of Delaware. 'His arm . turned completely black, and they have given him five antibiotics,' Karstetter told the paper of his grandfather’s condition. The 77-year-old patient is currently being treated at Baptist Medical Center in Jacksonville. His . grandson decided to contact the media about the health scare in order . to warn the public of the danger, saying that the bacteria is extremely . fast-moving, and seeking immediately medical attention could make all the . difference between life and death. In . a phone interview with MailOnline Thursday afternoon, Clarke's . granddaughter-in-law, Kimberly Kartstetter, said that the 77-year-old . married father of four is currently stable, but his condition is ‘hour . by hour.’ ‘He's a fighter,’ Kimberly told MailOnline. ‘He’s the toughest man I know.’ Crabbing gone awry: Clarke's grandson said that the man was bitten by a crab in Nassau County, Florida, over the weekend . Mrs Kartstetter explained that doctors are getting ready to perform a third surgery on her husband's grandfather to remove more necrotic skin from his right arm. Since the 77-year-old was admitted into the Jacksonville hospital, the team of medics treating him has removed all the skin and tissue on the affected limb down to the muscle. Kimberly Kartstetter added that her elderly relative, who is affectionately known to his family as ‘pop-pop,’ remains heavily sedated. According to the woman, Clarke’s doctors remain ‘cautiously optimistic’ at this time that they may be able to save his arm in large part thanks to the fact that the infection has not reached the muscle in the limb. Experts who have spent the past five days struggling to save Clarke’s life have recently found what is believed to be the right combination of antibiotics to prevent the infection from spreading further, according to Mrs Karstetter. On Saturday, Mr Clarke was fishing for blue crabs near his home in Yulee, Florida, when one of the critters pinched his finger. Kimberly said the 77-year-old, who has a degree in fish farming from Rutgers University in New Jersey, usually rinses his hands with alcohol after handling sea creatures, but for some reason he had failed to sanitize the wound Saturday. Clarke went to bed that evening, but woke up at around 4am Sunday with 105-degree fever and pain in his right arm, which has become swollen and quickly turned black. The man immediately went to a local hospital and was later airlifted to Baptist Medical Center in Jacksonville. Mr Clarke has remained in the hospital since Sunday, with his extended family, including his wife of 59 years, Shirley, by his side. ‘We all have hope,’ Kimberly Karstetter said. This was the first sympton that manifested on Henry Konietzky after he was infected with the Vibrio vulnificus bacteria in a Florida river at the weekend. Mr Konietzky died on Monday after the infection overtook his body . Florida resident Henry Konietzky . passed away 28 hours after noticing a small lesion on his foot, which . appeared a day after he went crabbing with his wife. Mr Konietzky had stepped on some ants before getting into the water, sustaining small bites. Doctors believe this was the gateway that allowed him to become infected by the flesh-eating bacteria, which is considered one of the deadliest strands of bacterium in the world and usually forms every year in the warm saltwater swimming holes of Florida. It is the ninth death in 2013 connected to the Vibrio vulnificus bacteria in the Volusia and Flager counties, with health officials warning locals to take serious care when visiting saltwater spots, especially with open wounds. Horrific: Henry Konietzky had no previous medical issues before encountering the bacteria . However, two men have recovered from the infection after contracting it fishing in the Indian River Lagoon, reported 10 News. Vibrio . vulnificus is a naturally-occurring bacteria in warm seawater that . belongs to the same family of bacterium as cholera and requires salt to . live. According to the . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the bacteria can also . be contracted from eating contaminated raw seafood like oysters. When open wounds on otherwise healthy . people are exposed to warm seawater containing the bacteria, the skin . can become infected, leading to a breakdown and ulceration of the skin. Immunocompromised people suffering from liver diseases and other ailments face a . deadlier risk: they have a higher possibility of the bacteria invading . the bloodstream, leading to potentially fatal complications. If the bacteria is ingested, healthy people can experience vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. For . people with weaker immune systems, consuming Vibrio vulnificus can . infect the bloodstream, leading to 'a severe and life-threatening . illness characterized by fever and chills, decreased blood pressure . (septic shock), and blistering skin lesions,' according to the CDC. Deadly bacteria: The bacteria can be contracted by eating contaminated raw seafood which can lead to vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, or through open wounds such as insect bites that contact the water . Bloodstream infections by the bacteria are fatal about 50 per cent of the time. Patients . are treated with antibiotics, and according to the CDC, infected wounds . must be treated aggressively - sometimes meaning amputation of an . infected limb. Between 1988 and 2006, CDC received reports of more than 900 Vibrio vulnificus infections from the Gulf Coast states .","George Clarke was out crabbing in Nassau County, Florida, when he was bitten .

A boy had to be treated by his own mother after he was taken to hospital when a firework hit him in the chest setting fire to his jumper. Amy McCabe was on duty at Yorkhil Hospital, Glasgow, when Ben, four, was taken to A&E following a display outside their home in Cumbernauld. A rocket misfired, hitting him in the chest, setting his shirt on fire and causing severe burns. Amy McCabe was on duty when her son, Ben, was brought in with third degree burns . Ben's body is now covered in scars from where the firework burned his flesh after getting stuck in his coat . 'It was horrific,' said Mrs McCabe. 'Watching sick children come in is hard enough, but there's no bigger . shock than when it's your own child.' Ben underwent seven skin grafts and is now fronting a campaign against non-official firework displays. Husband . Alan, 39, family and neighbours had gathered to set off some fireworks. Everyone was kept at a safe distance, but in a freak accident one fired . into Ben's jacket. 'Nobody could see where the rocket had gone,' Amy said. 'The next minute Ben started screaming. We can't understand how it happened but the firework went inside his coat and set his shirt on fire.' Mr McCabe wrapped Ben in wet blankets until an ambulance arrived. But by the time he arrived at hospital, the intense heat had burned through his skin. He was rushed to theatre where doctors discovered third degree burns on his neck, chest and behind his left ear. Surgeons performed seven skin grafts to mend the damage. Ben spent three weeks in hospital, after contracting MRSA - a common infection in burns victims. When he was eventually allowed home, he needed to be treated with creams and have his dressings changed four times a day.. The firework display was outside Ben's house where he with family and friends . 'We . soon realised Ben was very fortunate,' Mrs McCabe, who is now a dental . technician, recalled. 'Thankfully the burns hadn't affected his . respiratory system.' 'His burns are looking better every day.' The family were supported by the Scottish Burned Children's Club, run voluntarily by firefighter Mark Stevenson. 'The SBCC has allowed Ben to spend time with other victims, and get a break from feeling 'different'. 'His confidence has improved tenfold,' Mrs McCabe said . Now Ben, 6, has agreed to front the charity's campaign warning of non-official firework displays. SBCC is also lobbying the Scottish Government to change the law so people would have to prove they've completed a course on using fireworks safely before buying them. Amy said: 'Having fireworks banned from retailers altogether would be ideal, but regulating who can buy them is the next best thing. 'We'll never forget what happened - and never stop fighting to prevent it happening to someone else.'","Firework got stuck in Ben McCabe's jacket burning his chest and arms .

Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, moved nearly $57 million into a cemetery trust fund in 2007 specifically to shield it from lawsuits by victims of clergy sexual abuse . Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, moved nearly $57 million into a cemetery trust fund in 2007 specifically to shield it from lawsuits by victims of clergy sexual abuse, according to documents released on Monday. The documents were released as part of a deal reached in federal bankruptcy court between the archdiocese and victims suing it for fraud. Victims and their attorneys have accused Dolan of bankruptcy fraud, pointing to the June 2007 letter in which he told a Vatican office that moving the cemetery care money into a trust would provide ‘an improved protection of these funds from any legal claim and liability.’ The Vatican moved swiftly to approve the request, the files show, even though it often took years to remove known abusers from the priesthood. In a statement, Dolan called any suggestion he was trying to shield money from victims an ‘old and discredited’ attack. Jerry Topczewski, chief of staff for current Archbishop Jerome Listecki, said the money was always set aside in a separate fund for cemetery care and moving it to a trust just formalized that. Church law requires bishops to seek Vatican approval for any property sale or asset transfer in the millions of dollars. The correspondence was made public on Monday along with thousands of pages of other documents detailing sex abuse by dozens of priests in the archdiocese covering southeastern Wisconsin. Dolan called any suggestion he was trying to shield money from victims an 'old and discredited' attack . Victims have accused the archdiocese of transferring abusive priests to new churches without warning parishioners and covering up their crimes for decades. Although Dolan has no direct connection with the abuse, he has long been suspected of helping to protect the Church from its repercussions, particularly during his tenure as the archbishop of Milwaukee. Lawyers for the victims said the documents would prove that he transferred $130 million from the church’s books - about $55 million in a cemetery account, and $75 million in an investment account - to shield the money from abuse victims. The documents also show that Dolan oversaw a plan to pay some abusers to leave the priesthood. They included John O'Brien, who was convicted of fourth-degree sexual assault in 2000 in a case involving a 17-year-old. At least four other victims later came forward. The archdiocese barred O'Brien from ministry and celebrating Mass. In 2003, it offered him $10,000 if he would voluntarily agree to leave the priesthood and another $10,000 when Vatican officials announced their decision about his future. O'Brien took the deal but was not officially defrocked until 2009. Jeff Anderson, the attorney representing most of the 575 plaintiffs with sex abuse claims in bankruptcy court, said cases like O'Brien's show that the church put predators before children. Former priests John Wagner, left, was accused of making advances to students at the University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan in the 1980s, and Daniel Budzynski, right, repeatedly abused children and showed no remorse . He and many victims find it especially heinous that the church paid a priest who had already been convicted of a crime, and they fault Dolan for that. But Topczewski said the archdiocese had adopted the practice of paying priests leaving the priesthood years before Dolan took over. Most of the priests were not accused of wrongdoing, and the money helped them transition into their new lives, he said. At least three priests accused of sexual abuse received payments when they left the priesthood before Dolan's arrival, according to the documents. Six more left under Dolan, with deals calling for them to receive $20,000 each. Topczewski said the money covered the men's health care, but it also got ‘priests out quicker. That's what victims were asking for.’ In 2003, nearly 40 years after some of the earliest reported abuse took place, New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who was then archbishop of Milwaukee, sought permission to have the priest, Daniel Budzynski, officially defrocked. The Vatican office in charge of sex abuse cases, then led by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI, took more than a year to formally dismiss Budzynski . Despite the egregiousness of the . priest's crimes, the Vatican office in charge of sex abuse cases, then . led by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI, took . more than a year to formally dismiss him. The Budzynski case was among at least a half-dozen Dolan inherited when he took over the archdiocese in 2002 amid the growing clergy abuse scandal. It shows some of the difficulty church leaders had in dealing with serial molesters and a church bureaucracy that in many cases sat on pleas for priests' removal for years. Another case shows just how difficult it was to get rid of priests who wouldn't go voluntarily. John C. Wagner was accused of making advances to students at the University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan when he was in campus ministry in the 1980s. Weakland tried in the 1990s to get Wagner to voluntarily leave the priesthood, but Wagner refused. In 2005, as settlements with clergy sex abuse victims were piling up, Dolan wrote to the Vatican office in charge of the matter and recommended it kick Wagner out. Last week Dolan called the Supreme Court's DOMA ruling a 'tragic day for marriage and our nation' that went against 'the common good of all, especially our children' ‘The liability for the Archdiocese is great as is the potential for scandal if it appears that no definitive action has been taken,’ he warned, adding that. Wagner showed no remorse, and ‘his only concern has been his financial status.’ Dolan said that if the Vatican agreed to dismiss Wagner, an archdiocese fund could pay for his needs until he was eligible for a pension. Dolan didn't receive a response until 2008, when he re-submitted his request along with details of new allegations against Wagner. Archbishop Angelo Amato responded on behalf of the Vatican office and recommended Dolan ask Wagner to leave voluntarily, which Dolan did. Wagner's attorney rejected the request, saying the $20,000 payment that Dolan offered wouldn't cover the priest's expenses for the two years until his retirement. Wagner wasn't officially defrocked until 2012. Last week Dolan issued a joint press . release calling the Supreme Court's DOMA ruling a ‘tragic day for . marriage and our nation’ that went against ‘the common good of all, . especially our children.’","In June 2007 Dolan sent letter to the Vatican saying moving the money would provide 'an improved protection of these funds from any legal claim'

Adult Americans have ranked third last in a new international survey graphing basic numeracy skills across the world's 23 leading labor countries. And the literacy results are not much better, with the US proving well below the international average in the first-ever survey, which tested 5000 Americans aged 16 to 65. Overall only about one in eight Americans turned in a top performance in reading. Scathingly, some 112 people were unable to complete the survey's standard background questionnaire 'because of a literacy-related barrier: either the inability to communicate in English or Spanish or a mental disability'. The main problem identified by the data - developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development - was with younger American workers, who lagged in nearly every category. The oldest Americans in the sample turned in a higher-than-average performance in reading, with 9% of test-takers between 55 and 65 years old scoring at the top proficiency level, compared to just 5% worldwide. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said the findings were troubling. Back to school: Adult Americans have been toppled in a new international survey graph of basic literacy and numeracy skills, which extensively tested 23 countries . Above average: Older Americans fared well in the survey, identifying a major gap in the workforce, with younger Americans showing the worst results. Here people read inside the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. 'Adults who have trouble reading, doing math, solving problems and using technology will find the doors of the 21st century workforce close to them,' said Education Secretary Arne Duncan . 'Adults who have trouble reading, doing math, solving problems and using technology will find the doors of the 21st century workforce close to them,' Duncan told USA Today. 'We need to find ways to challenge and reach more adults to upgrade their skills. Interestingly, Japan and Finland ranked first and second in both categories, while Italy and Spain took the bottom two spots in both. The survey test was scored on a scale of 0-500. 1. Japan.................................................2882. Finland...............................................2823. Belgium.............................................2803. Netherlands......................................2805. Sweden.............................................2796. Norway...............................................2786.

France..............................................25421. United States..................................25322. Italy....................................................24723. Spain................................................246 . In numeracy - defined as 'the ability to access, use, interpret, and communicate mathematical information and ideas, to engage in and manage mathematical demands of a range of situations in adult life' - American adults achieved an average score of 253 out of 500, nosing out Italian adults who averaged 247 and Spanish adults who averaged 246. In literacy - defined as 'understanding, evaluating, using and engaging with written text to participate in society to achieve one’s goals and to develop one’s knowledge and potential' - American adults achieved an average of 270 out of 500. That put Americans well ahead of Italy and Spain, whose adults scored 250 and 252, respectively, but far behind Japan and Finland, whose adults scored 296 and 288 respectively. Harvard University professor Paul Petersen said the most 'distressing' point was the time in which it will take for these results to actually take effect. 'There's a 20-year delay between the quality of the education system and its impact,' he told USA Today. 'It's sort of like watching a car crash in slow motion.' 'Other countries have been catching up for some time. 'At one time, we had a really significant lead, but those people are disappearing from the workforce.' The 23 countries that took part in the survey - which was conducted August 2011 and April 2012 - were: Japan, Finland, Belgium, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Slovak Republic, Czech Republic, Austria, Estonia, Germany, Australia, Canada, Cyprus, Republic of Korea, United Kingdom, Poland, Ireland, France, United States, Italy and Spain. Japanese adults led the field in numeracy, averaging 288 out of 500. They were followed by the Fins, who averaged 282; and the Belgians and the Dutch, who both averaged 280. Donald Block, executive director of the Greater Pittsburgh Literacy Council, said a major contributing factor to the results of the United States was a decline in resources for basic adult education. Mr Block said this has been happening for past six years. 'We really have in this country ignored adult literacy as an important part of education,' Mr. Block said.","Survey of 23 industrialized countries ranks United States at 21 for numeracy, just in front of Italy and Spain .

Medics told him they would have to perform an emergency caesarean to stand any chance of saving Lauren's life, but that the couple's daughter would probably not survive such an early birth. Evie with parents Lauren Raphael and Kyle Moynan. Kyle faced losing both when Lauren went into labour . Terrified Kyle was forced to give the go-ahead for emergency surgery aware that both his wife and daughter may not survive. Although surgeons managed to stabilise Lauren, tiny baby Evie was kept in intensive care for months while doctors tried to help her grow strong enough to survive. But now, they are celebrating after Evie, now seven months, has been allowed to come home for the first time - a day Kyle feared he'd never see. Kyle said: 'There was a time when I feared I'd never have either my wife or my baby at home again - to have them both here is amazing. 'It was the worst experience of my life. It was so traumatic and I could do nothing but just stand there and watch while the doctors tried to save Lauren and baby Evie. 'I was worried I was going to lose them both. Medics told him they would have to perform an emergency caesarean to stand any chance of saving Lauren . 'I am just so relieved to have them both home and safe now. I am grateful to all the doctors who saved their lives.' Lauren was rushed into the Cumberland Infirmary after going into labour in the middle of the night when she was just under six months pregnant. Doctors quickly established she was suffering from pre-eclampsia, leading to organ failure. HGV engineer Kyle said: 'Lauren was wired up in the hospital bed. It was horrendous. All I could do is just stand there and watch while the doctors rushed around. 'There wasn't time for them to explain what was going on, so I had to just stand there and wait. I knew it had to be serious because of the way they were rushing around but I didn't have a clue what was happening. 'After what felt like forever a nurse pulled me to one side and told me that Lauren's life was in danger and in order to save her life they would have to deliver Evie.'

'We have two other daughters, Faye, eight, and Sophie, five, and I had to stay strong for them.' Lauren said: 'I was so ill and they were pumping me full of drugs. I had cannulas in both arms and doctors all around me. I was just terrified that I would lose my baby.' Luckily Evie was safely delivered but weighed only a tiny 1lb and 3oz and Kyle only had five minutes to see his newborn before she was rushed to Newcastle's Royal Infirmary by ambulance, where medics fought to regulate her breathing. Lauren said: 'We didn't know if baby Evie would survive but because I was so poorly myself I didn't really know that much about it.' Lauren stayed in hospital for a further two weeks and Evie was kept in an incubator in intensive care, where her life hung in the balance for two months later as a result of her being delivered so early.Dedicated parents Lauren and Kyle travelled to the hospital every day to visit baby Evie, who spent two months in intensive care and one in high dependency before being transferred to the Special Care Baby Unit at the Cumberland Infirmary, from where she has just been released.

The family are now relieved that Evie has been finally allowed home, aged seven months. Lauren, who works as a nursery practitioner was still working until the day Evie was born. She said: 'I had only just started to think about getting things for Evie - we didn't have her room ready or any clothes for her.' Baby Evie still has to use an oxygen canister to help her breathe but now weighs a more healthy 12lbs. Lauren said: 'I can't believe I was so close to losing my own life, and my baby's. It was such a whirlwind but I am just glad we are home and safe and Evie is doing so well.'

Car buyers are being forced to pay extra if they want the vehicle in a colour that the manufacturer says is beyond the norm, an investigation has found. It can cost buyers hundreds of pounds for basic colours. Even white now costs extra as it overtakes metallic tints in the popularity stakes. Experts fear motorists are becoming victims of ‘fifty shades of rip-off’. Pricey: This Seat Alhambra would cost you extra as it is not in the standard Salsa Red, according to Auto Express . An investigation by Auto Express magazine reveals that most mainstream brands now offer only one ‘flat’ or basic colour free of charge. And in most instances, customers will have to ‘upgrade’ to get greater choice - which pushes the price of the paint job beyond £500 for the majority of makers. The report says Spanish car maker SEAT - part of the giant Volkswagen Group - only sells a new Alhambra in Salsa Red at no extra cost. It notes: ‘However, if you want white paint, you’ll have to shell out £175. Prefer Deep Black metallic? The price rises to £500. Go a step further to the bronze-like Boal, and you’ll pay £635.’ 'Norm': This white Citroen DS3 comes at no extra cost, but any other colour commands a premium . Explaining why drivers are being forced to stump up more for a colour other than a flat red, a SEAT spokesman told the magazine: ‘The trend for white paint over the past five years has had the effect of diminishing the take-up of metallic over the same period. 'Obviously, paint is something we as a manufacturer have to purchase. And with fewer buyers choosing metallic as a cost option, we have to plug the financial gap by charging a nominal fee for certain ‘flat’ paints.' The Nissan Juke has only white as a ‘no-cost’ paint. The Auto Express investigation found that car makers charge the following range of prices for a non-standard paint job, depending on the exact colour and finish: . Audi: £340 to £715 . Citroen: £450 to £600 . Fiat: £300 to £460 . Ford: £495 . to £545 . Honda: £450 to £500 . Hyundai: £435 to £495 . Jaguar: £650 to £790 . Land Rover: £550 to £800 . Mercedes-Benz: £570 to £645 . MINI: £450 to £720 . Nissan: £450 to £550 . Peugeot: £450 to £550 . Porsche: £558 to £801 . Renault: . £495 . Toyota: £450 to £700 . Volkswagen: £460 to £595. The magazine says: ’Any other colour is offered as metallic only, and carries a £500 price tag. Similarly the Citroen DS3 has a flat white colour as the sole no-cost option. Nor does the cost to the customer of these flat paint finishes vary according to the size of the car. SEAT’s non-metallic white costs the same £175 on smaller models like the Mii city car as it does on the much larger Alhambra seven-seater. At the super-luxury end of the market, Bentley customers can pay up to £20,000 for their preferred satin finish and colour on a Continental GT Coupé or Convertible. It’s a similar tale with Ferrari for its historical tints such as Azzurru California, and Rosso Dino. Auto Express editor in chief Steve Fowler said: ‘Never mind Fifty Shades of Grey. One has to wonder whether motorists are victims of fifty shades of rip-off when it comes to a car’s paint job. ‘ . Paint specialist Paul Normyle who runs ‘Shine smart repair told Auto Express that several factors were to blame including an EU directive in 2006-07 that all paints must be water-based rather than oil-based adding to research and development costs. He said: ’This, of course, has a knock-on effect - and somebody has to pay for it.’ Improved paint quality also comes at a price: ‘Look at a red car from 10 years ago, and it’ll be pink because of oxidisation from the sun. That no longer happens.’ And the fashion for greater personalisation is giving car-makers some extra margin: ‘About 30 to 40 per cent of the paint price is the genuine cost. The rest is what you have to pay for the ability to personalise your car.’","Auto Express investigation found the true cost of car colours .

Under . an archaic Texan law to relieve overcrowding in prisons, Jones could . legally be released from prison in February 2018 having served less than . a third of the 99 years she received in 1984. Jones, . a pediatric nurse, was only convicted of murdering 15-month-old Chelsea . McLellan by intentionally injecting her with a paralytic drug, but she has always been suspected of killing as many as 47 other infants in a similar manner. Marina Rodriguez is allowing her dead son Feliciano to be dug up in a bid to get a fresh conviction for Jones . Following a recent . public outcry over her impending release, dozens of parents have come . forward claiming that Jones was involved in the dead of their children. A new conviction is the only course of action that would prevent the killer nurse from being released in the coming years. One . of the parents to come forward is Marina Rodriguez, whose son, . Feliciano was just five months old when he died at a San Antonio clinic . in 1981. Jones was the . nurse administering routine immunizations shots to Feliciano, but soon . afterwards he went into cardiac arrest and died. Monster: Nurse Genene Jones, shown left in 1984 and right in more recent times, was convicted . of using a powerful drug to kill baby Chelsea McLellan, but has always been suspected of killing as many as 46 babies . Rodriguez told CBS News that she is willing to have her son's body dug up and tested in an effort to ensure that the woman she believes killed her child never gets out of prison. ‘We . deserve to be heard,’ Rodriguez told Click2Houston. ‘I mean our . children were murdered and nothing was done. Feliciano will get . justice.’ Earlier this month Bexar County District Attorney Susan Reed pledged to re-examine all the baby deaths linked to Jones. ‘This is an individual who should never be out of prison,’ she told KENS5.com. ‘She was implicated in the deaths of 47 little babies and my goodness we cannot have someone like that free, period.’ Reed is now working with Rodriguez, to try find evidence to ensure Jones remains in prison.

Killer: Nurse Genene Jones, in custody of Kerr County Deputy Clay Barton, left, and Williamson County Deputy Loretta Pickett, right, arrives at Williamson County Courthouse on February 16, 1984 for her sentencing . ‘We will do whatever it takes to keep this monster behind bars,’ said Rodriguez. Even . though Jones was sentenced to 99 years in prison, she is scheduled to . be released in February 2018, according to state prison records. At . the time of her conviction Jones was sentenced under an old Texas law . that allowed violent offenders to be given early release by . demonstrating good behavior behind bars. The law has since been changed. Jones only convicted of one murder in 1984 because . the now-shuttered Bexar County hospital had shredded thousands of pounds . of records relating to the deaths of the other children, making . prosecution of those cases difficult. It is believed Jones killed as many as . 46 babies under her care at Bexar County Hospital while she worked there . from 1977 - 1982. If she gets out, she will have served less than one year for every infant death she is suspected of being involved in. Petti McClellan said: 'I need to find someone else, another family that was a victim of Genene Jones. That's the only way to keep this woman in prison. This is my mission now' Victim: Jones was sentenced to 99 years in prison for the 1982 murder of 15-month-old Chelsea McClellan who died under her care at Bexar County Hospital . Victim's Rights Advocate Andy Kahan has spent years pushing for investigators to re-examine all the cases linked to Jones. ‘Genene . Jones will be the first serial-killer to be legally released, not just . in the state of Texas, but across the country,’ victims' advocate Andy . Kahan, who is working on the case, told CBS News. ‘This will be . unprecedented.’ In July, Petti McClellan, whose daughter Chelsea was just 15-months-old when she was repeatedly injected with a lethal substance by Genene Anne Jones in 1982, made a desperate plea to find more . victims so Jones doesn't get released from prison. 'I need to find someone else, another family that was a victim of Genene . Jones. That's the only way to keep this woman in prison. Who knows what . she can do if she gets out.

His long blond hair has been shaved off, he has lost weight and he gets more tired than he used to. But the beaming smile and glint of hope in his eyes say that he is doing well. This is Neon Roberts, the little boy taken on the run by his mother Sally after she refused to let doctors treat his cancer with radiotherapy because she thought it would ‘fry his brain’. Neon was in desperate need of treatment – having just had a brain tumour removed – and the pair were discovered by police following a four-day nationwide hunt. Good news: Neon Roberts' last scan was cancer-free and he is recovering from the radiotherapy which he finally underwent despite his mother's fears . Neon’s last scan was cancer-free and he is recovering from the radiotherapy which he finally underwent despite his mother’s fears. His family say his bravery is an ‘inspiration’ as he continues chemotherapy. In a Channel 4 documentary to be shown on Tuesday, the eight-year-old speaks for the first time of how doctors discovered that he had cancer in October last year. Neon said: ‘At school, my neck went funny. It was twisting. My mum [took me] to hospital. They just did little things – like little movements. I had to move my neck and stuff like that. I had to stay at home for about two days and then go back there.’ What unfolded next was a nightmare: . doctors discovered that he had a brain tumour the size of a 50p piece. His father Ben Roberts, 35 – an IT consultant who is in charge of his . care during his treatment – described the moment he found out. Worrying: Neon Roberts was taken on the run by his mother Sally after she refused to let doctors treat his cancer with radiotherapy. He is pictured with his father Ben . He said: ‘I just remember seeing a computer screen with a scan of his head. I remember a tumour taking up a large portion of the screen. They were very insistent . . . this was a big thing that is growing fast and needs to be dealt with immediately. ‘It was so bang-bang-bang-bang-bang that there were no decisions to be made. ‘Obviously I had to sign a piece of paper before he went into surgery, but there was obviously no reason for me ever to consider anything [else].’ But Neon’s mother – who is estranged from her husband – had other ideas following the removal of the tumour. She packed a small bag of belongings . and fled with him to West Sussex to an alternative medicine centre. She . didn’t tell Mr Roberts where she had gone – and he now accuses her of . kidnapping Neon. Mr . Roberts, who lives in London, said: ‘I didn’t know where she was. The . window of opportunity for the radiotherapy to be done, on time, and for . the results to be as effective as possible, was getting shorter and . shorter. ‘The police then got involved because of the seriousness of this situation, and the hunt began. [She had] kidnapped my son.’ The pair were discovered by police four days later following a dawn raid. A . court ruled that Mrs Roberts’s judgment had ‘gone awry’, and Neon was . placed in the care of his father during the course of his treatment, . which is ongoing. In the documentary, an unrepentant Mrs Roberts, 38, said that ‘death by doctor is very common’. She . said: ‘Hospitals do him [Neon] no good. Everyone loves to think that . the doctors can have these almighty powers and heal us and do the right . thing by us and, oh yes, they really care, but I beg to differ. They’ve . been through a very corrupt system where they’ve been brainwashed. ‘We like to believe that they’re going . to do the best thing by us, but really, they’ve done the best thing by . the pharmaceutical companies. Concerns: Sally Roberts packed a small bag of belongings and fled with Neon to West Sussex to an alternative medicine centre. It sparked a police hunt . ‘Death by doctor is very common, but thankfully, because of the internet these days, a number of us have educated ourselves. 'There’s so many other options that we’ve been deprived of, denied. And it’s time for us all to wake up.’ Neon is halfway through his chemotherapy course and his family are overjoyed with his progress.His father told the Mail: ‘Neon is recovering well. He is much steadier on his feet these days. ‘Both his physical strength and inner confidence are growing on a daily basis. The doctors are happy with his progress although we would all like to see him eating more as he is still underweight. Playful: Neon is pictured before his traumatic cancer ordeal . ‘His hair is growing back nicely and his skin around his radiotherapy treatment areas is much softer, less dry and no longer slightly discoloured. ‘He is almost halfway through his chemotherapy treatment now and is coping well with the monotonous routine blood tests and trips in and out of various hospitals. ‘It is admirable and humbling when I see how he just gets on with it all and does not complain at all: an inspiration to all that have been close to him through this incredibly testing journey.’ You’re Killing My Son: The Mum Who Went on the Run airs on Tuesday on Channel 4.","Neon Roberts was taken on .

More than three dozen people who were brought into a Washington state jail on misdemeanor charges have come forward claiming inappropriate conduct and invasion of privacy after they were allegedly forced to strip naked on camera. The total number of complaints have tripled since 11 women and one man filed a lawsuit against Puyallup city jail in August, claiming cameras in their holding cells recorded their most intimate moments as they changed into jail uniforms or used the bathroom. 'You're basically treated like an animal, like a piece of meat,' one victim told King5. 'And these people are supposed to be upholding the law.' Almost all complainants were being held on suspected DUI offenses, for which they are typically released in a matter of hours. Scroll down for video . 'Sick': More than three dozen people being held in Puyallup city jail in Washington State on DUI charges have complained about their treatment at the facility after discovering intimate moments, such as going to the bathroom, were being recorded by CCTV cameras . Vulnerable: One woman claims that, after changing into a jail uniform, she was ordered back into her cell and told to take off her underwear, which was being filmed on camera . Indecent: Some of the videos, which were obtained by public record requests, show the women undressing . One female complainant said that, after changing into a jail uniform, a jailer asked her to go back into her cell and remove her underwear. 'What possible security reason could they have ... she's going to hand herself with her panties?' said Seattle attorney James Egan, whose law firm is handling the case. 'She's about to be released and out the door.' Egan has obtained several surveillance tapes from Puyallup city jail through public record requests, which were released to King5. He said the women were unaware their actions were being recorded on a monitor that was watched by mostly mail jailers. Scene: The jail at the center of the action is inside this Puyallup Police building in Washington state . Leading the case: Seattle attorney James Egan first filed a lawsuit on behalf of 11 women and one man in August. He has since been contacted by more than two dozen other people with similar stories . Attorney's acting on behalf of Puyallup city jail say the camera operations inside the facility are standard practive . One woman from Kings County, who chose not to be identified, was arrested for suspected drunk driving in April and said she refused to change her clothes until a female officer was present because she was comfortable with the four male guards nearby. 'Basically I was harassed for not doing it and put back in the holding cell and made to stay there for about 12 hours,' the woman said. Another woman said there was no reason for her to strip naked. 'I thought maybe it was for seeing if we have contraband of something, but we are already patted down,' she said. 'So then why would there be a camera still?' 'I just didn't feel comfortable with the situation so I wasn't going to do it': This woman, who asked not to be identified, refused to undress on camera after being arrested on suspected drunk driving . Jail experts say such levels surveillance were extremely unusual. Kenneth Burns, an architect who has designed 40 jails, said he was 'stunned' by the recently released videos. 'We do have lots of cameras but (usually) you cannot watch anywhere where someone is using the shower, toilet facilities or a changing area,' Burns told King5. However Puyallup City attorney Kevin Yamamota, speaking on behalf of the jail, said placing cameras in common areas and cells was standard practice and that there are no plans to change such methods. 'The jail videos we've watched so far don't show any inappropriate activity,' Yamamota said. Payallup City attorney Kevin Yamamota maintained jail officers had acted 'very professionally' 'In fact the corrections officers are acting very professionally.' A female victim was quick to disagree after seeing herself in the videos. 'It's so sick,' she said. 'Oh my god, I (didn't) believe my own eye. 'I feel sick to my stomach.' The case continues.

An astronaut aboard the International Space Station has become the first person ever to control a robot on earth from space. Flight engineer Chris Cassidy remotely controlled the K10 rover based in California from space to simulate deploying a radio telescope. The mini mission was designed to test how well a crew member in space can remotely control a robot, whether it is on the surface of a moon, planet or asteroid. Cassidy took the rover, based at the Ames Research Centre in California, on a remote test drive before using it to deploy the simulated antenna. NASA's K10 rover, based at the Ames Research Centre in California, performs a surface survey controlled by an astronaut on the International Space Station . Aboard the space station, he used live video from the rover and virtual terrain displays to give him a view of the rover's activities on Earth. The technology demonstration aimed to explore how communication delays over vast . distances affect an astronaut’s ability to take supervisory control of . an automated rover if it gets into a difficult area. Terry Fong, director of the Intelligent Robotics Group at Ames said: 'We successfully conducted the first ""surface telerobotics"" test session with the International Space Station. 'Cassidy used K10 to perform a surface site survey and to begin deploying a simulated Kapton film-based radio antenna.' Astronaut Chris Cassidy controls the rover from the Surface Telerobotics Workspace aboard the International Space Station . Cassidy uses the surface telerobotics technology (pictured) to drive the rover on earth before performing the delicate operation of deploying the simulated antenna. The demonstration aims to explore how the communication delays over vast distances affect an astronaut's ability to operate a robot . Fong told Space.com that further test drives between the rover and the space station will take place in July and August. They will concentrate on completing and inspecting the antenna deployment as well as studying the interaction between the human and the robot. The test is the first simulation of a human-robot 'waypoint' mission, which involves an idea to deploy a telescope on the far side of the moon. The concept is proposed by experts at the University of Colorado and Lockheed Martin, which is building the multi-purpose Orion spacecraft for Nasa. The K10 rover carries out a surface study using its cameras and on-board laser system. Such a robot could be used to deploy a radio telescope on the far side of the moon in the future . The proposed mission to the Earth-moon L2 position, would see astronauts on board an Orion spacecraft remotely place a low radio frequency telescope on the far side of the moon, using robots. The aim of the mission is to track down the 'cosmic dawn' of the universe that followed within 100 million years of the Big Bang. The location has been chosen as it is a 'radio quiet place' in the inner solar system, which will allow sensitive observations to be made about the first stars and galaxies. Cassidy was one of the astronauts to make a rare, hastily planned space walk from the International Space Station in May this year. He helped to replace a pump outside the station to plug a serious coolant leak. Ammonia coolant was leaking from the power system on board the International Space Station.","Chris Cassidy remotely controlled the K10 rover based in California from space to simulate deploying a radio telescope .

Government services across the US may have all but ground to a halt, but there is one that remains open for business as usual: the Presidential paradise of Camp David. The woodland retreat has stayed immune to the shutdown because it falls under the aegis of the Department of Defence, whose staff are designated as active-duty military personnel. More than 250 chefs, gardeners, electricians and anybody else who keeps the camp running in Catoctin Mountain Park in Frederick County, Maryland, should the President drop by are not only still working, but are also getting paid, according to website TMZ. Meanwhile, almost a million federal workers across the nation are sitting at home wondering when their next paycheck will drop through the letterbox as they wait for a resolution to the long-running dispute. Presidential paradise: U.S. President Barack Obama reads briefing material while meeting with advisors inside his cabin at Camp David, Maryland, last year . But their situation showed little sign of improving today as lawmakers consumed day three of the shutdown with a stalling game revealing no end in sight until the next crisis hits Washington around October 17. Meanwhile, in a speech at a Maryland . construction company yesterday, Obama challenged Republicans to 'stop . this farce' by allowing a straight vote on a spending bill. He . reiterated he will not negotiate on the spending bill or the debt . ceiling. Danger: The situation gives 'every appearance of getting dangerously close to the conversation on the debt ceiling,' Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Minority Leader of the House of Representatives . Obama said . there were enough Republicans willing to pass a spending bill . immediately if House Speaker John Boehner would allow a vote on a bill . without partisan conditions attached, a so-called clean vote. But Obama . said the speaker was refusing to do so because 'he doesn't want to anger . the extremists in his party.' The 180-acre compound has been a home from home for US presidents to relax in since  Franklin D. Roosevelt converted it in 1942 and renamed it 'Shangri-La', after the fictional Himalayan paradise. It was renamed Camp David by Dwight D. Eisenhower, in honor of his father and grandson, both named David. It has a swimming pool, tennis courts, a skeet range, a bathhouse, a bowling alley, a horseshoe pit and many cabins for the president's guests. Camp David is not open to the general public. Catoctin Mountain Park does not indicate the location of Camp David on its official park maps due to privacy and security concerns. (Pictured: George W bush and former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown during a visit to camp David in 2007) 'My simple message today is 'Call a vote,'Obama said. 'Take a vote. Stop this farce, and end this shutdown right now.' Congress . must raise the nation's borrowing authority or risk default by October . 17, and members of Congress now expect it to be the flashpoint for a . larger clash over the U.S. budget as well as President Barack Obama's . healthcare law. The . situation gives 'every appearance of getting dangerously close to the . conversation on the debt ceiling,' Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Minority . Leader of the House of Representatives. In fact, she said, 'we're in the conversation on the debt ceiling.' At . the same time, hopes that the debt ceiling fight could be resolved . without a catastrophe were raised by reports in The New York Times and . Washington Post that House Speaker John Boehner told other lawmakers he . would work to avoid default, even if it meant relying on the votes of . Democrats, as he did in August of 2011. A . spokesman for Boehner would neither confirm nor deny the reports, . restating previous public statements by the Speaker that 'the United . States will not default on its debt.' Senator Charles Schumer, the . second-ranking Senate Democrat, reacting to the reports, said, 'This . could be the beginnings of a significant breakthrough.' The . New York senator added, 'Even coming close to the edge of default is . very dangerous,' as he urged quick passage of legislation to raise the . $16.7 trillion cap on borrowing. Closed: Staff at National Parks and museums across the country were stopped from coming to work, closing those sites to the public . Deserted: The usually-crowded Statuary Hall, site of the original US House Chamber, is empty of visitors after tours were closed . Safety first: Airport-screening staff will remain at work during the shutdown with safety being a top priority . There was little action along with . the talk on Thursday. The Republican-controlled House continued what has . become a long process of voting to fund publicly popular federal . agencies - like the Veterans Administration, the National Park Service . and the National Institutes of Health - that are now partially closed. Republicans . know that neither the Democratic-controlled Senate or President Barack . Obama will go along with such an approach, but it allows them to accuse . Democrats of working against the interests of veterans, National Parks . and cancer patients. Up to one million U.S. federal workers have been on furloughs without pay since Tuesday morning. All military personnel continued in a normal duty status but a large number of civilian employees may be temporarily furloughed. The employees who have been put on unpaid leave are those classified as excepted workers, meaning that the president's staff of 1,265 at the White House will dwindle to 436. Staff at National Parks and museums across the country were stopped from coming to work, closing those sites to the public.

Thomson may have fathered a secret love child with classical violinist Eugenia Choi, it was revealed today. The ex-Citigroup executive's wife Melissa is divorcing him, due in part to an incident six years ago when he famously flew CNBC anchor Maria Bartiromo, on the group's private jet to an event in Asia and bankrolled $5 million to sponsor a . Sundance special Bartiromo was supposed to host. Court papers filed by Melissa's lawyers allege that in April of this year, her husband - now CEO of Headwaters Capital - admitted to 'a base, . immoral and disreputable act he had committed', and that the sight of him now disgusts and traumatizes her. The divorce papers by his wife of 25 . years demand that Choi, 36, hand over all court filings and . correspondence about the paternity of her daughter. Named in divorce battle: Married Wall Street executive Todd S. Thomson may have fathered a secret love child with classical violinist Eugenia Choi . Plan: Todd was served with the divorce papers in the most humiliating way possible because Melissa Thomson, second from left, wanted to cause him maximum embarrassment . According to the New York Post's Page Six, the divorce suit includes a deposition order . for the Juilliard-educated Choi, which demands she 'produce all . correspondence...and all court filings pertaining to the paternity, support or other . legal issues with respect to your daughter'. It was revealed earlier this week that 'Money Honey' Maria Bartiromo may be called as a witness in the bitter divorce battle after Melissa was granted permission by a Connecticut court to depose the 46-year-old. 'Certain facts which are in issue, or which directly assist in proving . the Plaintiff’s case, are within the knowledge or power of [Bartiromo],' the court said. Sources close to ­the anchor insist she has not yet been . served with papers and has no knowledge of the battle between the estranged spouses.

For the past six years Thomson has insisted that his relationship with Bartiromo, who is married to investor Jonathan Steinberg, was 'appropriate'. The court has heard already that the reason for divorce is that the marriage had 'broken down irretrievably', but they have also deemed it necessary to depose classical violinist Eugenia Choi. Incident: In 2007 Todd Thomson flew Maria Bartiromo on his corporate private jet owned by Citigroup back from a conference in Asia - a decision which was roundly criticized and was a contributing factor in his firing from Citigroup the same year .

Speaking out: Cecilia Attias has detailed the breakdown of her marriage of Nicolas Sarkozy . A . former wife of ex-French president Nicolas Sarkozy has claimed that when the pair split . her  friends immediately moved to divorce their husbands in the . hope of ensnaring the former French . president. But their hopes were dashed when Mr Sarkozy married Carla Bruni  following a whirlwind romance of just 80 days. Cecilia Attias, 55, who left him for another man just as he became head of state in 2007, will publish her long-awaited autobiography next month. In the book, extracts of which were published in Le Point and Elle magazine, the former first lady reveals that she felt compelled to leave the 11-year marriage because she felt after his 2007 election victory that he had 'sort of forgotten me'. The autobiography  'Une envie de verité (A desire for the truth) sees Ms Attias describe how Mr Sarkozy was transformed from 'dynamic' politician to an 'agitated' president, prone to 'terrible rages,' reported The Independent. 'It . is strange,' she writes 'that this man who was totally placid in his . private life, a man who never raised his voice at home… managed to . project such an impulsive public image.' It has often been suggested that Ms Attias, who has a 16-year-old son with Mr Sakozy, was the driving force behind her husband. She acted as an unpaid adviser when Mr . Sarkozy was finance minister in 2004 and headed his private office at . the ruling Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party. 'Contrary to what has been written, I . never sought to influence my former husband,' she writes. 'I never . advised him to take one direction rather than another.' Moving on: Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla married only 80 days after meeting - they met at a party a month after her split with his second wife . Happier times: Cecilia Attias married Sarkozy in 1997, but they divorced 11 years later . The potentially highly explosive memoire . will be of great concern to Mr Sarkozy, who is fighting corruption . allegations. Ms Attias, is expected to discuss meetings with . former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, whom Sarkozy is accused of . illegally accepting the equivalent millions of pounds in cash from. She helped secure the release of five Bulgarian nurses and a . Palestinian doctor being held captive, with many suspecting underhand . dealings. The mother-of-three also addresses Sarkozy's controversial decision to hold his election party at a luxury  club on the Champs Elysée. Following criticism Sarkozy implied that she had suggested it, but Ms Attias stresses it was a joint decision. Elections: Nicolas Sarkozy and Cecilia after casting his ballot at the Ile-de-la-Jatte in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris in 2007 . Cecilia Attias said her friends rushed to try and ensnare her former husband but Carla Bruni caught his eye . She also insists that the decision to take a trip on the billionaire’s yacht after his victory, was Mr Sarkozy’s idea and designed to entertain their son. 'Wherever we would have gone that night, we would have suffered heavy fire from the critics.' Just as controversially, there have been persistent claims . about Mr Sarkozy’s behaviour towards Ms Attias. Among the allegations in . ‘Love, Rupture and Betrayal’, a 2008 book by the highly respected . French author Hubert Coudurier, were claims of a vicious row between Mr . Sarkozy and his then wife before the presidential elections of May 2007. It led to a complaint to police, although no action was taken against . Mr Sarkozy, said Mr Coudurier.   Instead Mr Sarkozy moved out of the . family home after being warned by the then interior minister, Francois . Baroin, about the complaint. His ex-wife famously refused to vote for . her husband during the presidential election, and did not attend his . victory celebrations. When she finally surfaced, she looked haggard . and tearful. She was so depressed at the time that she was briefly . admitted to hospital and put on antidepressants. During a split from . his second wife in early 2005 and before he met current wife Carla . Bruni-Sarkozy, Mr Sarkozy used to spend nights with Anne Fulda, a . political journalist. New love: Mrs Attias married French PR executive, Richard Attias in 2008. They live together in New York . Even while he was sleeping with Mrs Fulda, Mr . Sarkozy would text and telephone Cecilia constantly, even though she was . conducting her own affair with Moroccan-born events organiser Richard . Attias, whom she subsequently married. In early 2006 Mr Sarkozy and . Cecilia were briefly reconciled, before Mrs Fulda returned to Mr . Sarkozy, and Cecilia to Mr Attias, whom she eventually married. Mr . Sarkozy desperately tried to win Cecilia back when he was elected . president, suggesting that she would be the 'new Jackie Kennedy' and . sending her off on the controversial mission to Libya to rescue the . prisoners. ‘He is extremely considerate to people when they're on his . side,’ said Coudurier. ‘But he can also be brutal.’ Ms Attias has previously spoken said the 5ft 6ins former president couldn’t keep his admirers away.

Stephen Owens was just a child when he testified against his mother, Gaile, who was sentenced to death after hiring a hit man to kill her husband. For 25 years Mr Owens, who had found his father's brutally beaten body in the family's Memphis home, had shunned his mother but he now says he has learned the power of forgiveness. He appeared with his mother, who was released on parole in 2011, at a book panel yesterday, to discuss how he came to terms with her crime. Support: Gaile and Stephen Owens pictured on the day she was freed from prison . 'I was so angry,' he told the Tennessean as he talked about the day his mother was sentenced to death. 'When I walked out of there, I thought to myself that we would never see each other again, if I had my way.' His mother had hired a contract killer in downtown Memphis, then made sure her and her two young boys were at a relative's house on the night of the crime. Mr Owens, who was 12 when he discovered his father's body, said: 'When I walked into the house that night I knew something was wrong.' They had appeared to be a normal Christian family but days after Ronald's murder, Mr Owens' mother was arrested. 'Not only had I lost one parent, I'd lost both,' Mr Owens said. His mother was found guilty of arranging for her husband to be beaten to death with a tire iron and was set to be the first woman to be executed in Tennessee for more than 180 years. Reconciliation: Stephen Owens wrote about coming to terms with what Gaile, pictured after her arrest, did . As she came to terms with her crime and sentence, Owens said she was desperate for contact from her two sons and family. 'I can remember months and years, birthdays and holidays, just wanting one card, and they didn’t come,' she said. The 61-year-old, whose execution had been scheduled for September 2010, finally had her death sentence commuted to life and she was released on parole in 2011. Supporters of the grandmother had urged . her release, claiming she was a battered wife who didn't use that . defense because she didn't want her young sons to know about the . physical and sexual abuse. The first thing the grandmother did after being freed was to hug her son. It was the moment that had kept her going through all her years in prison. 'I knew . that there was still hope that one day I would see Stephen, and one day I . would be able to tell him I did wrong, and that I was sorry,' she said. The pair had had no contact for decades but, as Mr Owens' resentment and anger slowly started to fade, he finally visited her in jail in 2009, 24 years after last seeing her in a Tennessee courtroom. He made the decision to see her after a fellow teacher at the Nashville school he was working in told Mr Owens he had been working with his mother in jail. At their reunion in the women's prison where she was being held, Owens was finally able to tell her son how sorry she was. 'She told me she couldn't change anything but that she was sorry,' Mr Owens told BH Publishing. New beginning: Gaile Owens leaves prison in 2011 after her death sentence was commuted to life and a parole board agreed to release her . He put his ability to forgive his mother down to time and faith, adding: 'Every step, that anger and resentment . releases.' His path to forgiveness has been documented in the book Set Free, co-authored by Ken Abraham, and their story was described by former Tennessean editor John Seigenthaler as going 'to the heart of what a caring, loving, all-embracing society we can be'. Mr Owens said: 'I realized mother and I both needed to be set free, my mother from the walls of prison, and me from years of resentment.'","Stephen Owens was a child when he discovered his father's body at home .

Daniel Chipchase, 20, has been given five life sentences for a string of child sex abuse crimes after the judge heard he showed 'sexualised behaviour' when he was just three . A man who began displaying 'sexualised behaviour' when he was just three years old has been jailed for life after admitting raping and abusing a string of young children. Daniel Chipchase, 20, was ordered to serve a minimum of six years before he could be considered for parole after the judge at Lincoln Crown Court told him children were at 'significant risk of serious harm' from him doing the same again. The court had heard that Chipchase had shown worrying signs of an unhealthy interest in sex from the age of three and four, when he drew indecent pictures and tried to assault other young children. It also emerged that Chipchase had escaped custody for raping a 10-year-old girl several years ago before going on to rape and sexually abuse three more young children. Chipchase, who was taken into care when he was five, was first referred to social services as a potential sex offender in February 1997, at the age of three, because of his 'sexualised' behaviour, the court was told. The following year, when Daniel had started school, a teacher reported him for sexually touching another boy in class, Chipchase's barrister said. Alexander Dunn said: 'Perhaps the most important mitigation is the background.  He has himself been subjected to serious sexual abuse and he has also witnessed abuse and violence perpetrated against his mother. 'It is clear that Mr Chipchase's formative years have had a profound and lasting effect on him. He is an extremely damaged individual. He was displaying sexualised behaviour from an extremely young age. 'He has also witnessed abuse . and violence perpetrated against his mother.' Mr Dunn added: 'In July 1997, at four, there was concern about sexualised behaviour as a result of drawings he made of genitals', and he said he used explicit language. The lawyer said that in December 1997, when Chipchase was still only four, he was reported for trying to perform a sex act on another young boy. 'In 1998 a teacher noted an incident at school where Daniel had his hand on another boy's groin', he said. In the same year Daniel was also seen trying to indecently assault a young girl. Mablethorpe beach: Daniel Chipchase was overheard raping a six-year-old boy in public lavatories at this resort . Mr Dunn said that Chipchase appeared to regard such incidents as normal behaviour and added 'In some ways Mr Chipchase has never had a chance.' He told the court that Chipchase was . taken into care two days after his fifth birthday. He initially stayed . with foster parents, but after his first conviction for rape he lived at . a specialised children's home where attempts were made to deal with his . sexualised behaviour. Mr Dunn quoted a probation report . which stated: 'It is clear that Mr Chipchase’s formative years have had a . profound and lasting effect on his well being.' 'It is clear that Mr Chipchase's formative years have had a profound and lasting effect on his well-being.' - Chipchase's barrister Alexander Dunn . He added: 'He is sorry for what he has . done. It is clear from the psychiatrist’s report that what he needs is . one-to-one counselling and help. That can be given to him in prison.' Mark Van der Zwart, prosecuting, said . that Chipchase was convicted in 2007 aged just 13 when he was given a . three-year supervision order after pleading guilty at Mold Crown Court . to raping a 10 year old girl. In October last year he was arrested . again after raping a six-year-old boy in a public toilet on a caravan site at . Mablethorpe, Lincolnshire. Police were alerted by a holidaymaker who was shocked by what he overheard while using an adjoining cubicle. Later further charges were brought . after two young girls came forward in his native North Wales to report . they had been sexually abused by Chipchase. One of the girls told how . she had been raped aged five while the other girl was subject to a . series of sex attacks starting when she was six. Chipchase admitted raping and assaulting the six-year-old boy, and a string of rape and sexual assault charges involving two girls when they were aged between four and eight. Lincoln Crown Court: Chipchase was given five life sentences after admitting a catalogue of sex abuse . Judge Sean Morris gave Chipchase five concurrent life sentences and placed him on the sex offenders' register for life. Passing sentence at Lincoln Crown Court, he told Chipchase 'You have pleaded guilty to a catalogue of sex crimes... 'You represent a significant risk of serious harm to children from further such offending. I am of the view that if you were to be alone with any young child, male or female, your sexual urges would get the better of you and you would commit serious sexual offences against them. 'This is a case where there are multiple victims and multiple rapes. Life is the only sentence that will provide lasting and enduring protection for the public.' Det Sgt Alison Smith of Lincolnshire Police said 'Daniel Chipchase is a predatory danger to children.' 'His future detention, supervision and monitoring will be of paramount importance.  It is frightening to think what might have happened to other children had his reign of terror and abuse carried on unchecked.'","Daniel Chipchase, 20, of Rhyl, north Wales, was taken into care at age five .

Victoria Elizabeth, a 29-year-old from Orlando, Florida, told MailOnline that a rapid maturation during puberty combined with comfort eating to cope with bullying led to her weight-gain during high school. But one day, when she glimpsed her 214lb self wearing a backpack in a picture taken by a classmate, 'I was horrified. I had no idea that I was wider than my overstuffed red bag,' she said. Scroll down for video . Fat to fabulous: Victoria Elizabeth, a 29-year-old from Orlando, has told how she was shocked by a high school picture of herself (left) into shedding 80lbs from her 214lb frame . 'It . was a hard reality to accept. This was not me,' said the five-foot-two aspiring writer. 'I was a bubbly, . energetic person. How could such an enthusiastic person be buried inside . someone so large?' Calling this moment her biggest . breaking point, Victoria describes how seeing her 'two chins' and realizing 'my arms were thicker than the thighs of most girls my age' motivated her lose weight. 'And that's really when it clicked that I needed to do something,' she explains. After skipping meals, with no avail, the then-16-year-old was enrolled in Navy Junior Reserves Officer Training Corps, which saw her running and doing calisthenics every morning. 'When 20 students depend on you to keep doing your pushups to avoid punishment, it's amazing how much willpower you can find buried inside you,' she explains in a piece on Huffington Post. Before: It was a hard reality to accept. This was not me. How could such an enthusiastic person be buried inside someone so large?' she says of her bigger high school years . Thanks to the high-octane exercise class, Victoria says she lost 44lbs by the end of high school, and a double shift as a waitress in college led her to shed even more weight. 'I was bubbly. How could such an enthusiastic person be buried inside . someone so large?' What's more, not having enough money . in college to afford 'luxury' foods forced her to stick to bare basics . like lean meats and frozen vegetables. Though she ultimately dropped to a healthy 134lbs, Victoria says it's still a battle to maintain her weight, which she writes about on her blog, Memoirs of a Yo-Yo Dieter. 'I struggle to still maintain my healthy weight and fitness patterns,' she told MailOnline, adding that she is currently trying to establish a career as a freelance fitness and nutrition journalist. After: Now, Victoria follows a mostly Paleo diet - which sees her avoiding grains, beans and dairy - but says the key to her healthy lifestyle is the occasional indulgence . 'Fortunately, I have more good days than bad as I have established fitness habits and a regimen that help keep me on track.' The regimen involves a mostly Paleo diet - also known as the caveman diet - which sees her avoiding grains, beans and dairy.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:23 EST, 3 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:53 EST, 4 October 2013 . Twitter has finally laid itself bare in an 800-page filing released late Thursday as it prepares for an eagerly anticipated IPO. The documents reveal that Twitter is planning to raise $1 billion for its upcoming IPO. With its initial valuation expected to be more than $10 billion, those with a large stake in the company are expected to get a huge payday when it goes public. But the major stakeholders identified in the documents exclude one key player - Twitter co-founder Biz Stone. Stone, who founded the company with CEO Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams, isn't listed in the documents, meaning he doesn't own enough stock to trigger legal disclosures. That suggests he likely unloaded at least a portion of his stake when he left the company in 2011. Jack Dorsey founded Twitter in 2006 when he was 29 years old. He now serves as chairman . As for Dorsey and Williams, the IPO will make them billionaires. Williams, Twitter's former CEO, owns a 12 percent stake in the company. If Twitter turns out to be worth at least $17.60 per share in the IPO, . Williams will be a billionaire at 41 years old. He remains on Twitter's . board of directors. Another board member, Peter Fenton, and his venture capital firm, Benchmark Capital, own a 6.7 percent stake. Next . in line with a 4.9 percent stake is Jack Dorsey, who came up for the . idea for Twitter with Stone and Noah Glass. Glass's shares aren't listed . in the documents. Many . of Twitter's 2,000 employees could become rich, too, if the company's . stock fares well. They won't be allowed to sell their stock until Feb. 15, at the earliest. Through the first half of this year, Twitter's revenue totaled $254 million, more than doubling from last year. If Twitter maintains that growth pace through the second half, the company's revenue will surpass $656 million this year. All told, Twitter generated $317 million in revenue in 2012. Twitter gets 87 percent of its revenue from advertising. The rest comes from licensing agreements that give other companies better access to the flow of tweeting activity on its service. Meanwhile, Twitter ended June with 218 million users, up from 30 million in early 2010. More than three-quarters of those users, or 169 million people, are located outside the U.S. Twitter's fastest growing markets are in Argentina, France, Japan, Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa. Bust the company isn't profitable. It takes more than cultural heft to build a business of substance, as Twitter is learning. The company has suffered uninterrupted losses of $419 million since its inception. That's something Twitter has been able to afford because it has raised $759 million from investors. The company still had $375 million in the bank at the end of June and hopes to raise at least $1 billion more in its IPO. But shareholders of publicly held companies don't tolerate losses for very long, and it could still be a while before Twitter turns a profit. Twitter's losses widened during the first half of this year to $69 million, up from $49 million in the same period last year. In contrast, both social networking leader Facebook Inc. and professional networking leader LinkedIn Corp. were profitable when they went public. To make money, Twitter will likely get more aggressive about showing ads. In the three months ending in June, Twitter generated revenue of $139 million, or an average of just 64 cents per user. In contrast, Facebook generated second-quarter revenue of nearly $1.2 billion, or an average of $1.58 per user, while LinkedIn posted revenue of $364 million, or an average of $1.53 per user. Growth by numbers: The company has only been in existence for seven years but has clearly made a dent . Twitter . co-founder Jack Dorsey (right) attended the Allen & Company Sun .

As Twitter cranks up its marketing . machine, it runs the risk of alienating an audience accustomed to seeing . relatively few ads in their news feeds.

The move to go public is one of the most highly . anticipated IPOs in tech history with Twitter the last of the major . social networking sites to go public. It comes after Facebook floated on . the US stock market in May 2012 for $104 billion (£66.2 billion) and, . despite seeing an initial slump in shares, has since had a resurgence. It . is thought that like Facebook, Twitter bosses' hands were forced by the . Jobs Act which requires a U.S firm to file an IPO once it has reached . 2,000 investors. The company has been ramping up its advertising products and working to boost ad revenue in preparation for the IPO. But it is still small in comparison to Facebook, which saw its highly anticipated IPO implode last year amid worries about its ability to grow mobile ad revenue. Twitter site was founded in March 2006 and has become one of the world's most popular social networking sites over the past seven years. Jack Dorsey's interest in programming . began at the ripe age of eight, according to a 2011 Vanity Fair article. He . came up with the idea for Twitter in his 20s and shared it with Biz . Stone and Evan Williams, two of his bosses at San Francisco software . start-up Odeo. Williams embraced the idea and made Dorsey, who was 29 at the time, the founding CEO of the new company. Stone, 39, and Williams, 41, have also helped create Blogger, Medium, and a host of other Internet ventures. Dorsey is currently thought to be worth around $1.1billion. Stone's wealth is estimated to be worth $200million while Evan . Williams, thought to be the richest of the three, is worth about $2billion. Faring better: Twitter will surely try to learn from the mistakes of Facebook, as the social media giant's stock price took a massive and prolonged hit after a much-hyped IPO in 2012 though just recently it bounced back . Twitter was created back in March 2006 but its popularity soon went through the roof with more than 500 million users registered worldwide as of last year and more than 500 million tweets sent a day.

If anyone doubted Cara Delevingne's catwalk supremacy then this year's Fashion Weeks will have surely convinced them. The 21-year-old model has graced a host of top designers' catwalk shows across the four fashion weeks, including Chanel, Valentino, Stella McCartney. And now, as if more proof were needed that the English model is every designer's pet, she has been spotted heading out in hot-off-the-catwalk outfits, something even the top supermodels don't manage to wangle. Cara wore the suit out (right) just two days after it was shown at the Spring/Summer 2014 Saint Laurent show in Paris on Monday (left) Cara attended the 'Mademoiselle C' cocktail party held at Pavillon Ledoyen in Paris with Rita Ora . Cara was seen at the Mademoiselle C premiere in Paris alongside friend Rita Ora in a sleek black bodysuit, slashed the navel, which had only just been seen on the Saint Laurent catwalk. The party, which followed a showing of a movie about former French Vogue editor, Carine Roitfeld, was attended by a host of A-list stars and fashion royalty. On Monday the quirky model left Stella McCartney's Paris Fashion Week show wearing the trouser suit she had modelled on the catwalk just minutes before. The gold suit may have been dressed down by Cara with trainers and a beanie hat, but it was unmistakably the same outfit she had just showcased in front of hundreds in the show. During Milan Fashion Week Cara was also seen heading into the party thrown to celebrate the opening of Stuart Weizmann's new flagship boutique in a Fendi dress which her friend Georgia May Jagger wore during the Fendi show earlier in the day. Cara managed to nab the Fendi dress Georgia May Jagger had worn on the runway just hours before and wore it to a party that evening, pairing it with a red jacket and shoes and a yellow bag . Cara walked the runway during Stella McCartney show in the gold suit (right) that she was then seen wearing out later, dressing it down with trainers .

She was then seen after the show seemingly leaving the building in the dress she had worn on the catwalk, carrying her classic black court shoes and still in her full stage make-up and wig. However, few models, no matter how famous, are given the new seasons clothes to keep, as there is generally only one or two versions of each outfit made for the catwalk. Cara’s staggering popularity, and the certainty of her being photographed wherever she goes means that even top designers are willing to bend the rules for her.

A Palestinian man has been accused of an horrific act of animal cruelty after posting a picture on Facebook apparently showing him torturing a mouse that he claims ate his wages. The picture, posted by a Facebook user from Gaza, shows the mouse suspended by its legs with rope from a ladder. It has been claimed that the man was punishing the mouse for destroying two bank notes worth 200 Israeli Shekels (around £35) that were in his closet. Cruel: A picture posted by a Palestinian man on Facebook appears to show a mouse being tortured after it ate his wages . The man said that he had just been handed his weekly wage and hid it in the cupboard for safe keeping. But many people are claiming that the picture and the Palestinian man's story is a fake and that it appeared on several other websites as a joke earlier in the year. Nevertheless the image provoked a strong reaction when it was picked up by the Gulf News website, with most readers appalled at the man's actions. One reader from the United Arab Emirates posted on the site: 'As desperate as the man must be to lose his money, torturing a helpless animal is not a good thing to do and not a solution. 'Another mouse may come and what will he do then? Repeat this stupid act!?!' Fake? The man also posted a picture of the two notes that he claims were destroyed by the mouse . But some questioned the outraged response of others claiming that people were more concerned about the mouse's fate than the plight of the Palestinian people. Similar actions landed a London teenager in hot water earlier this year. Andre Yankey, then 19, was spared jail by magistrates in July after making a homemade film showing him butchering a mouse. Yankey called himself a 'mouse killer' as he used a power tool to slice the rodent open and drill into its eye. The personal trainer said on camera the mouse would be 'terminated with The Blade of Doom' as he tortured and eventually killed it. But he was arrested when he sent the footage to a friend who was so disturbed by what she saw that she called the RSPCA. He was given a 12 week prison sentence suspended for 12 months and a two-year ban from owning animals.","The man posted the picture of the rodent tied up in Gaza on Facebook .

Republican governor Tom Corbett has compared the marriage of same-sex couples to the marriage of a brother and sister. The Pennsylvania governor this morning agreed his lawyers' comparison of the marriage of gay couples to the marriage of children in a recent court filing was 'inappropriate', before stunning the television anchor with a new analogy. 'It was an inappropriate analogy, you know,' the first-term governor  said on WHP-TV in Harrisburg. 'I think a much better analogy would have been brother and sister, don't you?' Scroll down for video . Controversial: Republican Governor Tom Corbett has compared the marriage of same-sex couples to the marriage of a brother and sister . Corbett is widely considered 'one of the country's most unpopular governors', with the latest polls showing only 20 per cent of voters feel his . performance in office to date merits his re-election. Nearly 70 . per cent believe that it is time for a change, according to the latest Franklin & Marshall College poll. F&M poll director and political science professor G. Terry Madonna told PENN Live Corbett has 'serious re-election problems' for 2014, because his priorities are out of step with voters. He . said Corbett's emphasis on privatizing the state's liquor stores in . addition to cuts to education funding have made him deeply unpopular . with his electorate. Corbett, a lawyer, former federal prosecutor and state attorney general, has been married to Susan Manbeck Corbett since 1972. They have two children: Tom Corbett, a project manaer for Electronic Arts in California, and Katherine Corbett Gibson, a former city prosecutor in Philadelphia. Corbett Gibson has reportedly separated from her husband Gerold Gibson, a 17-year veteran narcotics officer accused of stealing money and clothing from targeted drug homes. The couple has a son, Liam. Conservative: Governor Tom Corbett, left, with his wife Susan Manbeck Corbett and their son Tom Corbett, center .

Corbett also said this morning that he does not think a pending legal challenge to Pennsylvania's ban on same-sex marriage belongs in federal court. 'The Supreme Court left it up to the states to determine under their laws as to what is and isn't a marriage,' Corbett said. 'The federal court shouldn't even be involved in this. But if they say they are, then they're going to make a determination whether the state has the right to determine that a marriage is only between a man and a woman and not between two individuals of the same sex.' Messages left for a Corbett spokesman were not immediately returned. State attorneys in August included a reference to children in a legal brief involving same-sex couples seeking marriage licenses. In the court filing opposing allowing same-sex couples to intervene in the state's lawsuit to bar a suburban Philadelphia county from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, the lawyers made an analogy to a pair of 12-year-olds, saying if the children were issued a marriage license and tried to defend it in court, they wouldn't be taken seriously because the license was never valid. Corbett later rejected that analogy, saying the case revolved around the question of whether a public official had 'the authority to disregard state law based on his own personal legal opinion about the constitutionality of a statute.'","Republican Governor Tom Corbett has compared same-sex marriage to incest .

Children born last year are more likely than any previous generation to see their parents split up, research suggests. Nearly half will experience family breakdown, according to a report by the Marriage Foundation think tank. Its researchers estimate that 354,000 out of the 729,674 children born in England and Wales in 2012 will have parents who are separated by the time they reach the age of 15. Half of children born last year will see their parents split up, research from the Marriage Foundation suggests . The report also suggests that married couples are much more likely to stay together than those who are unmarried. The vast majority of children whose parents will still be together by their mid-teens will have a mother and father who are married, the report said. Only 5 per cent will have unmarried parents. Harry Benson, of the Marriage Foundation, said: ‘We continually hear about divorce rates shooting up and causing the exponential rise in family breakdown, but this is demonstrably not the case. ‘The percentage of marriages ending in divorce has actually fallen since 2005 to 42 per cent. For all marriages lasting over ten years, the divorce rate has barely changed since the 1960s. Chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw linked social problems in Britain to bad parenting . ‘It is the declining rates of marriage which provide the only conceivable explanation of the doubling of family breakdown since the 1980s. ‘Of the teenagers not living with both parents, just 32 per cent of cases involved divorce.’ Last week a report by the  chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw linked social problems in Britain to bad parenting. He criticised ‘hollowed-out and fragmented families’ where parents suffer a ‘poverty of accountability’. Sir Michael said many children were ‘alienated’ from their fathers, and warned of social problems resulting from ‘making excuses’ for bad parents. ‘Some people will tell you that social breakdown is the result of material poverty – it’s more than this,’ he said. ‘These children lack more than money: They lack parents who take responsibility for seeing them raised well. It is this poverty of accountability which costs them. ‘These children suffer because they are not given clear rules or boundaries, have few secure or safe attachments at home, and little understanding of the difference between right and wrong behaviour.’ Findings from the Centre for Social Justice have shown as many as one million children are growing up without a father. The report suggested married couples are much more likely to stay together than those who are unmarried . The Centre has also linked family breakdown to the likelihood of children being involved in truancy, juvenile delinquency and alcohol or drug abuse. The Marriage Foundation called on ministers to do more to help married couples and protect families in which children are raised. It was founded by the High Court judge Sir Paul Coleridge and seeks to improve public understanding of marriage. Its study comes at a time when the popularity of marriage is at an historic low. There were 241,100 weddings in England and Wales in 2010 compared with more than 400,000 a year in the early 1970s. In 2009, there were only 232,443 weddings – the lowest number since Queen Victoria was on the throne.","Marriage Foundation said half of children will experience family breakdown .

It’s a slice of fantasyland for the four-legged set and it’s been paid for by cash-strapped Uncle Sam. TriBeCa, one of Manhattan’s most affluent neighborhoods put a federal windfall worth millions into play this past summer. Local brass decided to spend the $5million earmarked in 2005 not on subways or bridges but to bankroll a dog run and install an immaculate landscaping along a waterfront park, MailOnline has learned. Scroll down for video . Decadent Dog: These paw-activated sprinklers set taxpayers back hundreds of thousands of dollars; at the TrBeCa Dog Run in the $5million renovated Hudson River Park . And last night the same group who plunked down the millions of dollars worth of sod and cement feted a star-studded gala to raise $2million in hopes to fund the Hudson River Park because they claim it ‘does not have a continuous allocation of city, state or federal funds.’ The entire pricey project cost $4.8million to groom the grounds in between Piers 25 and 26. The swath of park snakes for five miles along the Hudson River’s edge and includes manicured lawns, dotted with planters and meticulous landscaping befitting its boldface natives including: Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Connelly and husband Paul Bettany who are dog owners, as well as Gwyneth Paltrow, Robert DeNiro, Jay Z and Beyonce, Russell Simmons, Jenna Bush, Amanda Peet and husband David Benioff, and Leonardo DiCaprio amongst others. Luminaries like Mayor Mike Bloomberg and Brooke Shields lent their support to help raise funds for the Hudson River Park trust Thursday night. Of the millions that were spent to spruce-up the Hudson River Park, $642,000 was dumped on the yin-yang shaped Tribeca Dog Run. The decadent dog oasis allows puppies (K-9s that are 23 pounds or less) to frolic free from bigger dogs who have their own set of bricks to do their business. Demand has risen for dog roaming space because of the neighborhood's dog boom, says one longtime local. ‘There’s over 400 dogs in just one building—they’re dog crazy around here,’ a source told MailOnline. Stewards from the Hudson River Park Trust (HRPT), the state and city partnership chaired by third-term Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s girlfriend Diana L. Taylor, unveiled the dog run to the public this summer after successfully winning over New York Congressman Jerrold Nadler to shake D.C.’s moribund money trees. Hudson River Park Trust Chair and Mayor Bloomberg's girlfriend Diana L. Taylor delivers speech with their labradors Bonnie and Clyde . Congressman Nadler managed to procure the millions in federal funds to bankroll the spanking 5,000 square-foot stretch of grey-blue esplanade; taking pride in the amenities including: scaled down cabana umbrellas and even paw-activated fresh water fountains. Asked about the multi-million dollar dog park’s price tag paid for by the nation’s taxpayers Congressman Nadler’s office reverted back to a statement from August 5 when wagging tails (dogs and pols alike) triumphed during a ribbon cutting ceremony before mugs and snouts were photographed. ‘I am proud to have been able to bring over $4 million dollars in federal funds to the continued expansion of this park, which has become an invaluable resource to New Yorkers and visitors alike,"" said Congressman Jerry Nadler in a statement. 'The addition of the new dog run and recreational space on Pier 25 adds another layer to the many amenities Hudson River Park provides to the surrounding neighbourhoods. I am thrilled to join HRPT and the community in celebrating this new section of the park.' A day later, in a surprising about-face congressman’s camp told MailOnline that the monies for the park’s revamp were actually not federal. ‘No federal funds were used to construct the dog run.’ The congressman’s aide pointed to the 2005 bill where $5.6million dollars appropriated for ‘a pedestrian walkway along Route 9A in Hudson River Park, NY.’ Nadler's office offered no specifics on how those millions were spent. Federal money is often line-itemed to maintain beautification standards along the country’s scenic highways. Aerial view of the 5,000 sq ft plot of waterfront land before dog run was built . Still, at a September 26 meeting Madelyn Wils, the Trust’s president and CEO stood at a lectern before her peers and thanked Congressman Nadler for the federal cash and rejoiced in the dog run’s birth; the fourth dog run in the area. Wils lauded the landscaping of the 30,000 square feet of urban utopia and doted on the pristine grounds first ‘christened’ by none other than the Mayor Bloomberg’s yellow labradors Bonnie and Clyde. The schematics for the dog park used by some of Manhattan's elite dog owners . ‘Congressman Nadler appropriation of $4.8 million transportation funding made this opening possible.’ But Wils also couldn’t explain how federal transportation funds were allocated to construct the sultan dog digs and passed the buck to Congressman Nadler. ‘One might wonder why federal transportation dollars were being used to open a dog run,’ she said to an orchestra of laughs. ‘But maybe [Nadler] can explain it.’ More canned laughs filled the New York City’s Planning Commission hearing room. In lieu of this week’s federal government shutdown, few would feign to laugh now. Last night’s gala, co-chaired by Juliane Moore was hosted by actor Hugh Jackman (his wife's on the Gala Committee) and featured comedian Denis Leary. The list of notables also welcomed Hollywood staples such as Gala Committee members Brooke Shields, Martha Stewart, Edie Falco and Goldman Sachs partner Paula Madoff. Kerri Lyon, of The Hudson River Park Trust called the outdoor addition ‘an amazing gem along the Hudson River’ and stressed that the pricey dog run and landscaping were only part of a much larger project that also includes a restaurant. She defended Thursday's glitzy gala to raise funds for the trust that honored none other than Goldman Sachs. She said cash is in short supply to keep the park self-sustaining. Martha Stewart pledged her support of the Hudson River Park Trust at Thursday night's gala . ‘Hudson River Park does not have a continuous allocation of city, state or federal funds,’ she said. ‘It was designed to be self-sustaining so that the park is responsible for raising the funds (from a variety of public and private sources) required to operate and maintain itself.’ According to the Parks Department there are approximately 60 dog runs throughout the five boroughs and their price tags and upkeep vary. An average New York City dog run goes for around $375,000-while some navigating around waterlines can surge to $600,000. Like Tribeca’s K-9 kingdom, a dog run in Juniper Valley Park in Queens was built for $600,000. Steven E. Greer, the founder of BatteryPark.TV and 13 year resident of the area isn’t laughing and called the dog run and its surrounding upgraded parkland a disaster. ‘Give me a backhoe, concrete, and $20,000, and I can make a dog run. For $50,000, professional contractors can make one for a private company.’ While Greer acknowledged that government contracts often are ‘inflated many-fold’ this particular  park expansion and pampering for well-to-do pooches is beyond redemption. ‘Five million dollars is astronomical, egregious, even by government standards.’ Vincent D’Accolti, 25, who runs WeBuildLI.com and has begun installing dog runs on Long Island in addition to his home improvement offerings. He said the cost of a six-figure dog park was hard to imagine. ‘I thought a $15,000 dog run was elaborate.' Ultimately, D’Accolti says the rich or run-of-the-mill dog run need only accomplish the same call of duty. ‘When I think of a dog run it’s a place where a dog can piss and s---.’","Millions of federal tax dollars earmarked and spent on $642,000 dog park along Manhattan’s waterfront .

Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for giving Jackson an overdose of the anesthetic propofol in 2009, spoke to the Today show from prison on Thursday - just weeks ahead of his release. He said that he felt relieved that the world could finally hear facts in the recent case Jackson's mother had brought against AEG Live LLC - facts the world had not been able to hear in his own trial. 'My immediate reaction was one of tears,' he said of the verdict, which was reached on Wednesday. 'I cried only because for once the world was allowed to hear some of these facts.

'I was not given a fair chance to defend myself. [My lawyers] were not given a fair chance to defend me. I was very relieved that at last the world had a chance of hearing some of the facts.' Murray was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter for causing Jackson's death and is due to be released this month after serving two years out of a four-year prison sentence. But his lawyer, Valerie Wass, told Matt Lauer that the outcome of the recent AEG case will not affect Murray's conviction because that was based on the facts of the criminal case. When Lauer added that after the verdict the jury foreman said Murray was 'unethical,' the doctor argued with him. 'What the juror said was that if ethics were the issue, the conclusion might be different,' he said.

Murray said he plans to spend time with his children, family and supporters after his release. 'God . willing, I would be a model to show the world that despite adversity, . and when bad things happen to good people, they can restart their life . and succeed,' he said. His medical licenses were suspended after his conviction, but he could regain them, his lawyer said. Earlier this week, the jury in the wrongful death trial ruled that the concert promoter was not negligent in hiring Dr Conrad Murray because he was not 'unfit or incompetent'. Katherine Jackson claimed AEG Live should have done a thorough background check on Murray and was seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages for herself and her son's three children. The company denied hiring Murray and said he had been picked by the singer as the doctor for his upcoming shows. Accusing: Jackson's mother Katherine (right, pictured with his daughter Paris in January 2012) had brought the case against the concert promoters - a case which Murray called 'frivolous' Ruling: Superior Court Judge Yvette M. Palazuelos gathers the verdict documents in the case on Wednesday. The jury determined that AEG Live was not liable in Jackson's death . Witnesses said he saw the 'This Is It' concerts as a chance for personal redemption after being acquitted of child molestation. But as the opening date of the shows approached, associates testified that he had bouts of insecurity and agonized over his inability to sleep. They said he turned to the drug propofol and found Murray, who was willing to buy it in bulk and administer it to him on a nightly basis even though it is not meant to be used outside operating rooms. Testimony at the civil trial showed that only Jackson and Murray knew he was taking the drug. 'The jury's decision completely vindicates AEG Live, confirming what we have known from the start - that although Michael Jackson's death was a terrible tragedy, it was not a tragedy of AEG Live's making,' AEG Live attorney Marvin Putnam said.","Jury found AEG Live LLC was not negligent in hiring Murray to care for Jackson because the doctor was not 'unfit or incompetent'

A repeat drunk driver who plowed his pickup into a Seattle family earlier this year, killing two grandparents and badly hurting a mother and her newborn son, broke down on Thursday as he pleaded guilty to charges of vehicular homicide and vehicular assault. Mark Mullan, 51, faces a recommended term of 18 years in prison when he is sentenced in King County Superior Court next month. Mullan, a journeyman electrician with five prior drunken driving arrests, had a blood-alcohol content about three times the legal limit when he hit the family as they crossed a street in the Wedgwood neighborhood in broad daylight March 25. Emotional: Mark W. Mullan, pictured, pleads guilty to charges of vehicular homicide and vehicular assault, Thursday, October 3, 2013 in Seattle . He was on probation from a recent case, his license was suspended, and he was supposed to have installed an ignition interlock device in his truck. New grandparents Judy and Dennis Schulte, retired teachers from Kokomo, Indiana, who had recently moved to Seattle, were killed. Their daughter-in-law, Karina Ulriksen-Schulte and her son, Elias, were injured. Ulriksen-Schulte suffered a broken pelvis and head injury, and her injuries caused a stroke that has limited her speech. But her husband, Dan Schulte, said she is walking and talking more, is almost ready to come home from a rehabilitation center, and sees their son almost every day. Elias, who was 10 days old at the time, sustained skull fractures. He has had one major brain surgery and is due to have another when he turns 1, to relieve pressure caused by fluid on his brain. He is mostly acting like a normal baby, Schulte said, but there are concerns about his vision. Guilty: Mullan, 51, faces a recommended term of 18 years in prison for killing two grandparents and critically injuring a mother and her baby . Court: Mark W. Mullan, foreground, sits in court as family members are seen behind him. He will be sentenced to a possible 18 years next month . While he would have preferred to see Mullan sentenced to life in prison, Schulte told reporters after the court hearing that the plea would allow the family to focus on recovery as well as the legacy of his parents. 'While nothing can undo the damage to our family,' Schulte said, with his sister by his side, 'we're relieved he has decided to accept responsibility for his actions.' The case prompted calls for tougher DUI laws. The family has sued the city, alleging it failed to monitor Mullan. Schulte sat in the courtroom behind Mullan as the defendant looked down, frowning and sobbing briefly as he repeated 'guilty' five times, including to a charge of violating the ignition interlock device law. Mullan dabbed his mouth with a tissue as he regained his composure. Judge Ken Comstock read Mullan's statements about the offenses as described in the plea agreement. 'While I was driving I hit four people who were legally crossing the street,' the judge read before asking whether the statement was true. 'Yes, it is,' Mullan responded. King County Prosecutor Dan Satterberg noted that the Legislature's decision to toughen vehicular homicide laws in 2012 provided for a longer prison term for Mullan, and he said keeping Mullan off the roads for 18 years was the best his office could do. Some 150 people a year are killed by drunken drivers in Washington, and Satterberg credited Schulte for promoting the 'ongoing cultural change we need in this state to make people think twice before they drink and drive.' In July, Schulte joined Governor Jay Inslee as he signed a law requiring that anyone suspected of a second impaired driving offense face mandatory arrest and have an interlock device installed on their vehicle within five days of being charged.","Seattle man Mark Mullan, 51, faces 18 years in prison for the crash, which killed two grandparents and badly hurt a mother and her newborn son earlier this year .

Expenses: Chancellor George Osborne among nine ministers claiming housing and travel expenses for their children . Scores of MPs including cabinet ministers are claiming housing and travel expenses for their children, it has been revealed. The watchdog which monitors their expenses says 148 MPs made claims to rent larger properties for their young families, and claimed back money for their children’s train journeys. These arrangements are within the rules, which were changed after the 2009 expenses scandal to allow MPs with children to claim thousands of pounds more than others. However critics say such arrangements, revealed last night under freedom of information laws, would be unthinkable in the private sector, and are still too generous. Such expenses revealed last night by the regulator involve nine minsters, including Chancellor George Osborne and culture secretary Maria Miller. Labour leader Ed Miliband and shadow front bench couple Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper - who all have young children - have claimed allowances for them under the rules. The latest claims in the Daily Telegraph come as MPs are poised to receive a £10,000 pay rise, recommended by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa). Ipsa’s chairman Sir Ian Kennedy is expected to defend the move today, with a speech in which he will argue ‘you get what you pay for’ But Danny Alexander, the Treasury chief secretary told the Mail that voters would be ‘appalled’ if politicians accepted a huge rise while salaries in the rest of the public sector have been capped. Mr Alexander said: ‘I think the British public would be appalled at the prospect, particularly given the state of the public finances. ‘MPs have not seen the proposals as yet but I hope that when they come forward that they reflect the pay situation in the rest of the public sector and the very difficult economic circumstances we are in.’ Ipsa will not publish its long-awaited proposals for MPs’ pay and pensions until next week, and it is not expected it will come in until 2015. But the body, which was set up in the wake of the expenses scandal, is widely expected to propose a pay rise of up to £10,000, coupled with cuts to MPs’ gold-plated pension. The pay recommendation will also cast renewed scrutiny on the wider package of MP perks, including their expenses - claimed by 148 MPs for 300 children. Claiming: Culture Secretary Maria Miller is also among the nine claiming. These arrangements are within the rules, which were changed after the 2009 expenses scandal . Many MPs insist that the necessity to have two bases means that they must be compensated for the costs associated with their children . Their basic wage is £66,000 and child benefit has now been axed for other working families earning more than £60,000. Since 2010, MPs have claimed almost £140,000 for their children’s travel. They are allowed to claim £2,425 for each child who ‘routinely resides’ with them. But more than 90 MPs have claimed above the accommodation cap of £20,000 a year - even for flats. Divorced Greg Barker, the energy minister, claimed £23,904 between 2011 and 2012, for a two-bedroom flat in central London - £2,150 a month. Meanwhile his ex-wife and children live in his constituency of Bexhill and Battle for £697 a month.Mr Barker said: ‘All of the claims were pre-approved by Ipsa and fully comply with the Ipsa rules.’ Chris Ruane, the Labour MP for the Vale of Clwyd, claims £1,906 a month for his London flat. He has two children and his eldest daughter turned 18 in November. He also owns a flat about three minutes’ walk away. Mr Ruane said: ‘I have acted completely within the rules.’ The biggest travel claimant was Mary Creagh, the Labour MP for Wakefield, who has two children and claimed £4,061 in one year, mostly on rail tickets. On the BBC’s Question Time last night Dr Sarah Wollaston, Tory MP and GP, said MPs should have a pay rise in return for giving up expenses and second jobs to make it a more ‘professional’ system. But Labour’s Margaret Hodge said: ‘The timing is absolutely dire. Why should we be different from teachers and other public sector workers?’","Chancellor George Osborne among nine ministers claiming .

Alex Rodriguez has sued Major League Baseball and its commissioner, saying they are trying to destroy his reputation and career. Rodriguez took a swing for the fences and accused Major League Baseball and Commissioner Bud Selig of pursuing him in a 'witch hunt' designed to smear Rodriguez’ character and cost him tens of millions of dollars.The lawsuit was filed Thursday in New York State Supreme Court by lawyers for the Yankees third baseman. It seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for what it alleges was a relentless campaign by the league and Selig to 'destroy the reputation and career of Alex Rodriguez.' Lawsuit: Alex Rodriguez has sued Major League Baseball, accusing the league of engaging in 'tortious interference' in an effort to force him from the sport and potentially cost him tens of millions of dollars . Under fire: Alex Rodriguez has sued Major League Baseball and its commissioner, saying they are trying to destroy his reputation . • Baseball is paying $5 million to Anthony Bosch, the proprietor of the now-defunct Biogenesis anti-aging clinic suspected to be a source of illegal PEDs to players, for his cooperation in its case against Rodriguez.• Baseball has repeatedly violated terms of a confidentiality agreement between the parties by leaking information damaging to Rodriguez to selected news outlets.• MLB investigators have bribed and intimidated witnesses, and on at least one occasion impersonated police officers.• Baseball attempted to buy Biogenesis records from Porter Fischer, a former Biogenesis employee, for $125,000, and that after Fischer reported the documents stolen, an MLB employee eventually bought them from an undisclosed source for $150,000 in cash that was 'handed off in a bag at a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., area restaurant.' The suit claims Selig and MLB tried . to smear Rodriguez’s reputation to 'gloss over' Selig’s past inaction . and tacit approval of the use of performance-enhancing substances in . baseball, which the lawsuit said had turned the 'Golden Age of Baseball' into the 'Golden Age of Steroids.' The lawsuit said Selig hoped to redeem himself and secure his legacy as the “savior” of America’s pastime. Rodriguez is appealing a 211-game suspension for violating baseball's drug agreement and labor contract. The . lawsuit says the suspension will cost him tens of millions of dollars . in salary and could prevent him from meeting certain performance goals . in his contract worth millions of dollars. 'Taking down Mr. Rodriguez would vividly demonstrate that Commissioner . Selig had learned from the errors of his previous explicit or tacit . tolerance of steroid use,' the lawsuit said. MLB spokesman Matthew Monte says the league has no comment. Appeal: Rodriguez is appealing the 211-game suspension levied against him in August by MLB for his alleged involvement with Bosch and Biogenesis . Defiant to the end: Mr Rodriguez blasted the Yankees and MLB during a minor league rehab assignment in August, saying they were conspiring to keep him off the field . The lawsuit was filed as Rodriguez . appeals a 211-game suspension for violating baseball’s drug agreement . and labor contract. The suspension stemmed from baseball’s investigation . of the Biogenesis of America anti-aging clinic. The suit accuses . the league and Selig of planting negative stories about Rodriguez in . the news and trying to muddy his name while protecting a witness under . investigation for allegedly providing steroids to minors. 'Such . are the lengths that Commissioner Selig and MLB have stooped to in their . witch hunt against Mr. Rodriguez — paying and protecting someone under . investigation for providing steroids to minors,' the lawsuit said. The . court papers noted that Rodriguez’s suspension was four times the . length of the other 13 players suspended in connection with the . Biogenesis probe and the longest non-lifetime ban in baseball history. They said the suspension was also 161 games longer than the 50-game . suspension contemplated by the Joint Drug Agreement in the players’ contract. The lawsuit said the suspension will cost Rodriguez . tens of millions of dollars in salary and could prevent him from meeting . certain performance goals in his contract that are worth millions of . dollars. It also said two potential sponsors — Nike Inc. and . Toyota Motor Corp. — have terminated negotiations with Rodriguez for . potential sponsorship contracts and Rodriguez’s voice work as a hero for . an animated movie, 'Henry & Me,' has been cut. The movie chronicles . the Yankees’ history and features baseball stars, past and present. Questions remain: The suit does not address whether Rodriguez used banned substances . Worked his way back: Despite all the forces working against him - age, rehabilitation after a second hip surgery, a looming ban - A-Rod worked his way back to the Majors after a successful Minor League rehab . Mr Rodriguez was suspended for his involvement with the now-closed Biogenesis of America clinic in Coral Gables, Florida. The 13 other players penalized accepted their suspensions, which included a 65-game ban for Mr Braun and 50-game penalties for the others. MLB said Mr Rodriguez's was suspended under baseball's joint drug agreement 'based on his use and possession of numerous forms of prohibited performance-enhancing substances, including testosterone and human growth hormone over the course of multiple years.' He also was disciplined under the collective bargaining agreement 'for attempting to cover up his violations of the program by engaging in a course of conduct intended to obstruct and frustrate the office of the commissioner's investigation.' Mr Rodriguez is being treated as a first offender under the drug program, which means any suspension doesn't start unless upheld by an arbitrator. Following hip surgery in January and a leg injury sustained during a minor league rehabilitation assignment in July, Mr Rodriguez returned to the Yankees on the day he was suspended. The 38-year-old hit .244 with seven homers and 19 RBIs in 44 games. 'I'm really looking forward to at least one full off season of hardcore training,' said the oft-injured third baseman. 'I haven't had that in quite a long time - then come back in tremendous shape and help this team win. This team has a lot of things to do over the winter. Obviously my situation is going to play a big part in it.' A-Rod and New York squawked at each other in the summer, with Mr Rodriguez maintaining the Yankees were trying to keep him from returning. The team denied the accusation. He is owed $86 million by the Yankees over the last four seasons of his record $275 million, 10-year contract. If he is suspended for the bulk of next season, the team has a chance to get under the luxury tax threshold of $189 million.","The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages .

Tough line: The Prime Minister is preparing to take proposals for reform to a European summit in an attempt to renegotiate the relationship with Brussels ahead of a referendum . David Cameron will this week demand the return of powers from Brussels amid new evidence of the massive cost of EU regulation to Britain. A report published today by the Open Europe think-tank claims that the top 100 EU regulations are costing the UK more than £27billion a year, outweighing benefits in a quarter of cases. The Prime Minister is preparing  to take proposals for reform to a European summit in what is seen as the first stage of attempts to renegotiate the relationship with Brussels ahead of a referendum. EU leaders are meeting to discuss ways to improve growth and competitiveness. Open Europe is publishing a list of the 100 most costly EU regulations to the UK economy using Government data. It concludes they cost the economy £27.4billion a year – more than the expected revenue from council tax. In at least 24 cases, the Government’s own impact assessment finds estimated costs outweigh the estimated benefits. The rules include a ‘temporary agency workers directive’, giving temporary staff more employment rights, and an ‘energy performance of buildings directive’, which requires all properties sold, built or rented to have an Energy Performance Certificate. Benefits are also said to be vastly over-stated and in the case of the flagship climate change regulations, Open Europe estimates that 95 per cent of envisaged benefits have failed to materialise. Difficult balance: EU diktats cost the UK £27bn a year including £4.5bn for banking rules, £3.4bn climate and energy legislation and £4.1bn for the Working Time Directive . Analyst Vincenzo Scarpetta said: ‘It is hard to understand how policymakers can knowingly impose costs on the economy that outweigh the stated benefits of regulation.’ Annual figures for the five costliest EU regulations are capital rules for banks at £4.5billion; the Working Time Directive, £4.1billion; the EU Climate and Energy Package, £3.4billion; the Temporary Agency Workers Directive, £2billion; and the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, £1.5billion. Business leaders have also condemned rules on working hours and the hiring of agency workers, environmental and food labelling and plans to require 20 weeks’ maternity leave on full pay.","Think-tank Open Europe is publishing a list of the 100 most costly EU regulations to the UK economy according Government data .

Attack: The hacker was able to remove customer names, encrypted credit and debit card numbers, expiration dates and other information (stock image) Adobe said a cyberattack on its systems has exposed credit-card information of 2.9 million customers. The maker of Photoshop and other software said on Thursday that the attacker accessed Adobe customer IDs and passwords on its systems. Through that, they were able to remove customer names, encrypted credit and debit card numbers, expiration dates and other information related to orders from customers worldwide. The company does not believe attackers removed credit and debit card numbers that weren't encrypted. Adobe is notifying customers and resetting passwords. It has alerted banks processing Adobe payments to help protect customer accounts. It is also working with federal law enforcement on its related investigation. 'Cyber attacks are one of the unfortunate realities of doing business today,' Brad Arkin, Adobe's chief security officer, wrote in a blog post on Thursday. 'Given the profile and widespread use of many of our products, Adobe has attracted increasing attention from cyber attackers.' The California-based company says it is also investigating illegal access to the source code of numerous Adobe products and believes the attacks are related. Adobe shares fell 64 cents to close at $50.88 on Thursday and were unchanged in after-hours trading. Chris Petersen, chief technology officer and co-founder of security specialist LogRhythm, said the incident was a ‘chilling reminder’ to all software companies. He said: ‘When it comes to the source code breach, the first risk Adobe is concerned with is that malicious code was inserted into product source code and then distributed to customers in a compiled form. Adobe has alerted banks processing Adobe payments to help protect customer accounts . ‘The second risk is their source code being out in the open to would be attackers. Having access to product source code can allow attackers to identify software vulnerabilities that have been undiscovered to-date. ‘Both risks could result in a treasure trove of zero-day exploits against Adobe software. If indeed the source code stolen pertains to ColdFusion and Acrobat, this could leave thousands of web servers open to at-will compromise and make it easier to compromise end-user systems. ‘This breach is a chilling reminder that all software companies should be on guard, as they too could be a stepping stone to other targets.’ Tony Neate, CEO, Get Safe Online, said: 'Unfortunately these types of attacks do happen, despite how much companies do to protect confidential customer information. 'Adobe has been great at keeping affected customers updated by email, but we must be wary that criminals may decide to jump on the bandwagon and send emails posing as the company.

A . member of the New York Bar, Farrow, like his mother, Mia, has shown a . special interest in protecting children caught in armed conflict zones . and those suffering with AIDS. If Farrow was to join MSNBC's new weekend lineup, it would signal something of a minor shakeup for the network. Last month, MSNBC announced that .

Indeed, Al Sharpton was added to the lineup in 2011 and has been a success and according to the Hollywood Reporter, Griffin has been in discussions with Farrow for a while. Special role: Ronan is a former U.S. Global Youth Issues envoy and worked alongside Hillary Clinton . Colleagues: If Ronan Farrow joins MSNBC he will join Alec Baldwin (left) who is hosting a new prime-time variety show on Fridays and long-time stalwart Rachel Maddow (right) Ronan Farrow's precocious intelligence was recognized at age 11 when he became the youngest student to attend Bard College at Simon's Rock in Massachusetts.The school for gifted students usally accepts first-years at age 16 but he complete his senior thesis in political science and philosophy and graduated at age 15.Accepted into Yale Law School in Connecticut, Farrow deferred his admission until he was 18 so that he could work as an adviser to Richard Holbrooke, the former United States Ambassador to the United Nations.He was present the night that Holbrooke tragically died in December 2010 from complications arising from a torn aorta.From 2001-2009, he worked as a UNICEF spokesperson and visited Nigeria, Angola and Sudan, writing pieces on the protection of Darfuri refugees in Sudan.In additions to his studies at Yale, Farrow has worked at the State Department as an Obama administration appointment and one official speaking on condition of anonymity referred to him as 'a friggin' genius,"" adding that ""he’s young but he has a depth of experience that many people twice his age lack.'He has written extensively as a journalist, especially on his experiences in Africa and in 2013 he co-authored an attack on the Congressional investigation of the 2012 Benghazi attack.He was serving as Special Adviser to the Secretary of State for Global Youth Issues but has left that post after accepted as Rhodes Scholar to Oxford University this fall. The network refused to comment on the speculation. Farrow himself has not commented on the MSNBC report, but did offer up a humorous tweet referencing his alleged father, Frank Sinatra. 'Listen, we’re all 'possibly' Frank Sinatra’s son,' he wrote to his 130,000 plus followers this morning. Rumors about the parentage of her son Ronan, 25, have long dogged Mia Farrow, and she finally addressed the issue in an interview with Vanity Fair saying the legendary crooner was 'possibly' his father. Farrow, now 68, said that Sinatra was the great love of her life, and says, 'We never really split up.' When Vanity Fair asked Sinatra's daughter about Ronan being treated as if he were a member of her family, Nancy Sinatra Jr told them: 'He is a big part of us, and we are blessed to have him in our lives.' Farrow married Sinatra in 1966 in Las Vegas when she was 21 and he was 50. The marriage fell apart 18 months later when she refused to drop her critically-acclaimed performance in Rosemary's Baby to star in a movie with her husband. They divorced in 1968. In 1980, Farrow started a long-term relationship with Woody Allen, although the two never lived together. Farrow became Allen's muse and starred in 13 of his films, most notable Hannah And Her Sisters in 1986. Her relationship with Allen ended in 1992 when she discovered he was having an affair with her oldest adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn, then 22. It was believed that the news Allen may not be his father could be welcome to Ronan - the pair had a very public falling out when Allen began his romantic relationship with Previn. 'He's my father and married to my sister. That makes me his son and his brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression,' Ronan has said. 'I cannot see him. I cannot have a relationship with my father and be morally consistent... I lived with all these adopted children, so they are my family. To say Soon-Yi was not my sister is an insult to all adopted children,' Ronan said of the relationship. Sense of Humor: Ronan Farrow plays with the 'possibility' that his real father is legendary singer Frank Sinatra and not legendary comedian Woody Allen . Possible Father: Portrait of singer and actor Frank Sinatra taken in the 1950s as his career experienced a resurgence . Ronan's Twitter page is full of celeb photos including one with Jemima Khan, right and left with Katy Perry . Old life: Allen is pictured with Farrow and two of their children, Dylan Farrow and Satchel - now Ronan . Following the discovery of naked photos of Soon-Yi in Woody's possession, Farrow launched a messy custody battle over their three children. And the strained relationship with his father doesn't seem to have held Ronan back; and he has been deemed a child prodigy. He enrolled in Bard College at the age of 11, graduating at 15, and moving on to the prestigious Yale Law School and graduating by the age of 21- a year younger than most students finish their undergraduate degree. Since leaving school, Ronan has worked as a special adviser to the State Department, specifically focusing on the youth issues in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He has lent his face and name to charitable causes for years, serving as a UNICEF spokesperson from 2001 to 2009. After working under Hillary Clinton in the State Department, Ronan is now moves into the ranks of her husband, former president Bill Clinton, with Monday's Rhodes scholarship nomination.","Ronan Farrow, 25, is said to be in talks to present his own MSNBC show as the network seeks to engage with a Millennial audience .

Former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton today claimed paying a £1,020 fine for drink-driving would be difficult 'because his finances are complicated' as he was banned from the road for 20 months. The 63-year-old pleaded pleaded poverty as he admitted the charge during a 15-minute hearing at Colchester Magistrates’ Court this morning after arriving with his glamorous blonde girlfriend. The football legend is currently going through a divorce after he split from his wife Sue, which was used as an excuse as to why he couldn't pay the court costs in full. The court heard that he was found to have more than double the legal amount of alcohol in his system when he was breathalysed on February 24 following an anonymous tip by a member of the public. Peter Shilton arrives at court with his partner Stephanie Hayward to answer a charge of drink driving . He was driving a 2010-registered Jaguar XF near the home of his girlfriend, Stephanie Hayward, in Manor Road, Colchester, Essex, at time and was caught after an anonymous tip-off to police. As he left court, Shilton, England’s most capped player, said: 'I’ve nothing to say, really - just that I had a very fair hearing.' He left in a taxi from the nearby Colchester Town railway station. Magistrate Ilona Perkins-Van Mil banned Shilton from driving for 20 months and ordered him to pay fines and costs totalling £1,020.

The court heard that Peter Shilton was found to have more than double the legal amount of alcohol in his system when he was breathalysed . Prosecutor Joseph Stickings said police were called to Ms Hayward’s home at about 8.35pm. They had received an anonymous tip-off that a man, who seemed drunk, had been driving nearby. 'As police were speaking to a woman at the address, Mr Shilton pulled up behind the police car,' Mr Stickings said. 'The officer spoke to him and could smell alcohol on his breath. He was tested and provided a positive breath test.' Shilton, of Burton Green, Kenilworth, Warwickshire, wore a charcoal suit with a tie today and spoke only to confirm his name and address and enter a plea.

He arrived with singer Ms Hayward, who sat in court wearing a black dress with lace sleeves.

He added: 'He’d had a very pleasant day at a family celebration and had consumed wine with meals throughout the day. 'He had gone to move his car closer to his partner’s address because he had an early start. 'He didn’t travel far, just a couple of streets, and wasn’t driving very quickly at all. 'He was aware he had consumed alcohol but it was throughout the day so he did not think he was over the limit - if he had, he would not have pulled up behind the police officer.' Mr Tawn described the arrest as a 'matter of deep regret' for Shilton, who has three points on his licence following a speeding offence in March 2011.

New York City might soon get a new type of subway car that allows more circulation in trains. Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials are envisioning a subway car of the future that will end the era of the captive car. A 142-page document released this month outlines the needs for the next 20 years, in which the authority noted the benefits of articulated trains. The trains are similar to accordion-style buses that have no doors between cars, allowing unrestricted flow throughout the length of the subway. New subway cars: The idea is to have articulated trains similar to accordion-style buses that have no doors between cars, allowing unrestricted flow, like this train in Berlin, Germany . This is a similar model adopted in cities like Berlin, Paris and Toronto. According . to the authority, the move will ‘both maximize carrying capacity’ and . allow passengers to ‘move to less-crowded areas of the train, balancing . loading and unloading times at all doors’. It will also provide refuge from mariachi bands, other performers and preachers of all types, commonly seen roaming throughout the New York subway system, if people so choose to escape. The cost difference between the current model and the proposed models has not been made clear. Adam . Lisberg, the authority’s chief spokesman, said that increased capacity . could improve ‘dwell time’, which is the period during which a train is . stopped in a station, often because of overcrowding - and allow more . trains to run, according to the New York Times. He cautioned, though, that with a 109-year-old system, any major change required extensive review. ‘If you make a bad call on changing equipment in a new subway car order,’ he said, ‘the consequences can be pretty serious.’ Crowded: The move will allow passengers to move to less-crowded areas of the train, balancing loading and unloading times at all doors¿ and find refuge from performers, if they wish . Freedom: The new cars would allow passengers to move throughout the train. Here, a break dancer performs in a subway car in New York City . In 1924, the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation introduced plans for the ‘Triplex’, with a hinged, multi-sectioned body. It operated on the B, D, N, Q and R lines for 40 years, representing ‘the height of transit modernity’ at a moment when elevated lines often still featured wooden cars, according to the New York Transit Museum. Today, many of the city’s subway cars are well past their prime, most strikingly those on the C line, known by their model number, R32, and for the tin-can siding that will continue rolling beneath Eighth Avenue for at least a few more years, said the New York Times. Follow suit: This is a similar model adopted in cities like Berlin, Paris and Toronto, pictured . Behind the rest: Richard Barone, Director of Transportation Programs at the Regional Plan Association, says the current trains ¿don¿t function right now to allow people to circulate' Transit planners have urged the authority to consider articulated trains for future fleet upgrades. ‘We’re one of the largest systems in the world that doesn’t do it,’ said Richard Barone, the director of transportation programs at the Regional Plan Association. ‘Our trains don’t function right now to allow people to circulate.’ Andrew Albert, a member of the transportation authority’s board, recalled that separated cars had served another purpose for the city in a different age. ‘Remember the time when we were in the high-crime era and gangs were roaming through the trains?’ he said. ‘Everybody loved the locked end doors.’ The report from the transport authority does not state when the project would come into effect and start rolling on the tracks under New York City.","Metropolitan Transportation Authority releases 142-page report this month on the future of the subway system .

Forfeit: Sir James Crosby today offered to give up 30 per cent of his £700,000-a-year pension . The disgraced boss who was the 'architect' of the collapse of Halifax owner HBOS yesterday became the first man to forfeit his knighthood for more than 60 years. In a sensational admission of guilt, Sir James Crosby said he was 'deeply sorry' for the disaster that unfolded at the banking giant after he left in 2006. It comes after a damning report by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards last week singled him out as 'the architect of the strategy that set the course for disaster' and savaged his 'reckless incompetence' as chief executive. The 57-year-old has also offered to forfeit 30 per cent of his gold-plated pension of £580,000 a year every year until he dies. This is equal to around £175,000, which he hopes will be given to a charity or the shareholders of Lloyds – which controversially rescued HBOS in 2009 – whose nest eggs have been decimated. In a final humiliation he was last night forced to quit his £125,000-a-year job as a senior independent director of the catering giant Compass, having already lost two other major roles in the wake of the scandal. Sir James, whose knighthood was awarded under Tony Blair in 2006 for 'services to the finance industry', said he believed 'it is right that I should now ask the appropriate authorities to take the necessary steps for its removal'. Last night, there were calls for other bankers to follow his lead by either forfeiting their knighthoods or sacrificing a part of their pensions built up during their reckless leaderships. John Mann, the Labour MP who sits on the Treasury Select Committee, said the move is 'highly appropriate', adding: 'This sets the benchmark for others. 'At last, we have a banker who is prepared to say he got it wrong and wishes to make amends. 'I hope now that this is not an isolated stance and others will follow his example and give up some of the grandeurs of power and pension benefits that they have gained on the back of poor leadership of the banks.' Sir James was among three HBOS chiefs who were savaged over their 'catastrophic failures of management' by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards. 'Chastening': Sir James, pictured giving evidence to the Treasury Select . Committee admitted that the Parliamentary Commission report made . for 'very chastening reading' Country pile: Sir James Crosby's large home near Harrogate. He has . offered to surrender 30 per cent of his £580,000-a-year pension pot . He was singled out as one of the . leaders who steered the bank to the brink of collapse – saddling . taxpayers with a £28billion bill to bail it out. The report said the former bosses' 'high-risk' strategy, 'reckless lending' and 'deluded' leadership all . contributed to the disaster – yet all three have since moved on to . lucrative positions in the City. In a heartfelt statement yesterday, . Sir James said the report had made 'very chastening reading'. He offered . his 'sincere regret for events' and added: 'I am deeply sorry for what . happened at HBOS and the ensuing consequences for former colleagues, . shareholders, taxpayers and society in general.' Under investigation: Former HBOS chief executive Andy Hornby and ex-chairman Lord Stevenson who could potentially face being barred from working as company directors for life . Banking disaster: Former HBOS chief executive Sir James Crosby was heavily criticised in the Parliamentary Commission last Friday . A friend of Sir James said last night: . 'He saw the newspapers and decided he didn't want to become part of a . Fred Goodwin-style witch-hunt. 'He wanted to be able to meet friends and business acquaintances in the eye and know he'd done the right thing.' It marks a dramatic fall from grace for a man who was known as former prime minister Gordon Brown's favourite banker. Pension pot: Sir James Corsby has built up a pension pot worth an estimated £25million . Renouncing a knighthood after accepting it is almost unheard of. It . is thought the last time it happened was in 1948 when an Indian lawyer . and politician called C P Ramaswami Iyer (pictured) renounced his . following Indian independence. The . year before, the Maharajah of Vizianagram had renounced his knighthood . on the grounds it was not in keeping with the ideals of Republican . India. In 1969 John Lennon returned an MBE he received in 1965 in protest over Britain’s involvement in Biafra. If an honour is to be taken away, evidence is put to the shadowy honours Forfeiture Committee, a group of senior civil servants. Their recommendation goes via the Prime Minister to the Queen who makes her decision. A notice is then published in the London Gazette that the honour has been forfeited. The . process can take weeks or months. But anyone writing directly to the . Forfeiture Committee to tell them they are returning an honour is likely . to see their case dealt with slightly faster, a source said. He lost his lucrative high-profile job . at Bridgepoint, the private equity firm, and his trusteeship of the . charity Cancer Research UK in the wake of the damning report. But he . will still enjoy a pension of around £400,000 a year. David Ruffley, the Tory MP and a . senior member of the Treasury committee, said Sir James's move was . 'better late than never'. He said: 'Frankly, the relinquishing of 30 per . cent of his pension is a highly arbitrary figure. It still sees this . walking advertisement for corporate incompetence taking home over . £400,000 in pension every year until he dies.' Sir James's contrite behaviour is in . sharp contrast to the lack of any public displays of regret by Mr . Goodwin, the former chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland. He had to . be stripped of his knighthood by the Queen and agreed to forfeit part . of his pension only after a long and bitter campaign, although it is . still worth £342,500 a year. Mr Mann said the man who replaced Sir . James as HBOS chief executive in July 2006 – Andy Hornby – and its . former chairman, Lord Stevenson, should be in the firing line. When Mr Hornby, now 46, left the bank . in disgrace three years later, his pension was worth £240,000 a year. Pension experts said it is likely to be worth around £320,000 a year . when he reaches 50 and can start claiming it. An ordinary saver would have to build . up a pension pot of around £11million to generate the same pension . income, according to financial advisers Hargreaves Lansdown. Mr Hornby has received the 'complete . backing' of bookmaker Coral, where he receives a package of more than . £500,000 as chief executive. Lord Stevenson has also received the support of bookseller Waterstones where he is an independent director.","Sir James Crosby has a pension pot worth an estimated £25million or £580,000-a-year .

Up to 20 retired British soldiers could face arrest and prosecution as part of a police inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday. The prospect of murder or manslaughter charges was last night condemned by former senior military figures as ‘disgraceful’ and ‘politically motivated’. The men, mostly in their sixties and seventies, face questioning under caution about the events that took place in Londonderry on January 30, 1972, when 14 civil rights marchers were killed. Flashpoint: Troops grab a marcher on Bloody Sunday in 1972 . Lawyers that have been hired by the Ministry of Defence will represent the ex-soldiers. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) last year launched what it expects to be a ‘lengthy and complex’ criminal investigation. The force’s historic inquiries team is looking at thousands of killings that took place over the 30 years of the Troubles. Families of those who were shot dead have called for members of the Parachute Regiment to be prosecuted. But Richard Kemp, a former colonel in the Royal Anglian Regiment – which was also in Londonderry on the day – said it was disgraceful that troops faced arrest and potential prosecution. An armed soldier attacks a protestor on Bloody Sunday when British Paratroopers shot dead 14 civilians on a civil rights march in Derry City . As many as 20 British Paratroopers could face murder charges for the deaths of Irish protestors on Bloody Sunday in 1972 . ‘Although I utterly condemn  the unjustified killing that took place on Bloody Sunday, it is  despicable that 41 years later  law officers are planning to prosecute the soldiers involved for murder,’ he said. ‘This ridiculous, politically motivated prosecution is not in the public interest and should not be permitted.’ Colonel Edward Loden commanded the unit involved in the Bloody Sunday shootings . He called for senior officers to face legal action if charges are brought against those who served under them, adding: ‘If these men acted improperly or unlawfully on that day, and charges are brought against them, then charges must also be brought against those who commanded them.’ It is understood the PSNI will begin interviewing military personnel who fired shots on the day in about a year. But the investigation faces serious practical obstacles. Some witnesses have died and some evidence has been lost or destroyed. The Bloody Sunday Inquiry by Lord Saville, which began in 1998 and published its report in 2010, gathered testimonies about the events of the day. But the evidence cannot be used for any prosecution as soldiers, who spoke to the judge anonymously, were assured their evidence would not be made available to the police. Prosecutors will have to satisfy themselves that bringing charges is in the public interest. If prosecutions are brought for murder, manslaughter or other serious crimes, it raises the prospect that soldiers could be put behind bars for actions during a military operation of more than 40 years ago. At the same time, as a result  of the Good Friday Agreement, terrorists who committed atrocities aimed at the police or the Armed Forces in Ulster have been released from prison. Patrick Mercer, the independent MP and former infantry officer, said: ‘Justice must be done. But should a prosecution occur, it has got to be weighed very carefully against the Good Friday Agreement. Fourteen unarmed protestors were murdered at the march which was held in the name of Catholic civil rights in Londonderry . A mural by by the Bogside Artists, in Bogside, Derry, pays homage to the protestors whose lives were taken by British paratroopers on Bloody Sunday . ‘Convicted murderers were pardoned and released. ‘This puts any potential military offenders in an extremely difficult positions and presents the government with a political, social and military landmine.’ The Bloody Sunday Inquiry into one of the most notorious days in the history of the Troubles spent £200million over 12 years examining what happened. The soldiers gave anonymous evidence at the Saville Inquiry which cannot be used to pursue criminal charges . Lord Saville concluded that those shot by paratroopers during a Roman Catholic civil rights march in the Bogside area of Londonderry were unarmed and that the killings were ‘unjustified and unjustifiable’. His report prompted an apology to the families of victims by Prime Minister David Cameron. A PSNI spokesman said: ‘For the investigation to be as comprehensive and effective as possible, police will be asking for public support in the form of witnesses who gave evidence to the Saville Inquiry now making statements to detectives.’ A Catholic priest prays above one of the shooting's victims on Bloody Sunday which killed 14 .","Up to 20 retired British soldiers could face arrest and prosecution as part of a police inquiry into the events on January 30 1972 .

The League Against Cruel Sports is targeting people hunting illegally, hare coursing, badger baiting and other wildlife crimes (file photo) The charity will use cameras mounted on remote-controlled aircraft to monitor land previously off-limits (file photo) Chief executive Joe Duckworth said: 'There is a war in the countryside and whilst there are still individuals determined to flout the law and seek new ways to avoid detection, the League will continue to explore safe, tested and innovative technology to further our charitable aim of ending cruelty to animals in the name of sport.' The charity said the use of drones would support its teams on the ground already gathering intelligence and evidence of illegal activity. It maintained that all its operations were 'proportionate, necessary and justified' and were only carried out when there was a 'strong possibility of cruel criminality taking place'. Mr Duckworth added: 'We are excited to be the first animal welfare charity in Great Britain to be exploring drone technology. 'We are confident that it will make a fantastic contribution to bringing wildlife criminals to justice.' The charity is working with non-profit aerial surveillance and monitoring organisation ShadowView to use the drones. Tim Bonner, of the pro-hunting Countryside Alliance, said the League Against Cruel Sports was becoming 'increasingly desperate' and was living in 'cloud cuckoo land'. 'We think this is completely impractical and the League Against Cruel Sports has spent the last three years talking about the investment in what it calls ""surveillance"",' he said. 'They haven’t had a single conviction under the Hunting Act of a hunt as a result of their activities in the last three hunting seasons. 'We think they are increasingly desperate. The idea that flying a drone over a hunt is suddenly going to lead to convictions [...] They are living in cloud cuckoo land. 'The fact is that the law is unworkable and in our view a ridiculous piece of legislation. 'The chance of multiple prosecutions of hunts are very, very limited.' Mr Bonner said there were also civil liberty questions to answer on drones flying over private property filming. Activists from the League Against Cruel Sports staged a protest against proposed badger culls in October, and now the charity is to use drones to spy on wildlife crimes . 'They are some really quite profound arguments going on about whether a non-Governmental organisation should be able to carry out these sort of activities without proper scrutiny,' he said. 'If this was a serious attempt to bring hunts to court we would have expected to have heard about it in the courts and from lawyers - and not in the newspapers. 'They are increasingly desperate and when you look at the effort organisations like the League Against Cruel Sports put on using the legislation, we consistently beat them in the courts. 'There have been a handful of hunts prosecuted in the last eight years. 'There are nearly 300 hunts in the country and between 20,000 to 25,000 individual hunting days each season, and from that you are seeing a tiny number of prosecutions - most of which fail.'","The League Against Cruel Sports is to monitor land previously off-limits .

David Cameron was accused of presiding over a damaging 'fudge-a-rama' on Heathrow last night – as it emerged that an independent review of airport capacity will not report back for three years. The Prime Minister told MPs that he would be announcing an independent commission in the coming days in a bid to settle the vexed question on where new airport capacity in the South East should be put. Former CBI boss Sir Howard Davies will lead the review, which ministers hope will win cross-party backing. Scroll down for video . Finger pointing: Boris Johnson has vowed to fight any Heathrow expansion and challenged David Cameron to rule it out 'forever' But the appointment of Sir Howard, who made his name as an advocate for business, is likely to raise eyebrows. Green groups also drew attention to his time as a special adviser to former Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson, who is now one of the country's leading climate change sceptics. Sir Howard, who oversaw the creation of the Financial Services Authority, hit the headlines last year when he was forced to quit as director of the London School of Economics following revelations about its links to Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi. Boris Johnson and David Cameron are good friends - but they have a funny way of showing it. The Mayor of London has regularly launched attacks and poked fun at the Prime Minister. Mr . Johnson was elected for a second term in charge of the capital in May, . but used a speech to supporters to admit they did it despite the Prime . Minister. Mocking him Boris said: 'We survived the rain, . the BBC, the Budget - and the endorsement of David Cameron.' Four years earlier, Boris turned on Mr Cameron over his claims that British society was 'broken'. He . said that the now Prime Minister's claims were 'piffle' adding that the . success of British Olympians in Beijing proves youngsters are far from . 'aimless, . feckless and hopeless, addicted to their PlayStations'. But . it was just last month that the Mayor launched an extraordinary attack . on David Cameron yesterday, warning him to stop ‘pussyfooting around’ on . the economy. He urged Mr Cameron to be more . ‘ambitious’ by cutting taxes, cutting regulation and investing in . infrastructure such as a new airport in the South-East. And now today he has tried to embarrass the Prime Minister over Heathrow. But his report will not be published until the summer of 2015, after the next election. The decision will cause dismay in the business community which argues that an urgent decision is needed to keep Britain competitive. London Mayor Boris Johnson launched a furious attack on the Government's stance, saying it was 'madness' to even consider expanding Heathrow. Mr Johnson, who is promoting his own scheme for a new runway on an island in the Thames estuary, said the decision to hold a three-year review would damage business. He said: 'It's just a fudge, it's just a fudge-a-rama and it's just an excuse for a delay – there's almost three years to run until 2015. 'If such a commission were not to report until after the next election we'd have lost a huge amount of time. I don't think British business would be remotely satisfied with that answer. 'What I worry about is that we are now seeing a stealthy U-turn being carried out which I don't think is in the interests of London or indeed of the country as a whole.' Asked if he would lead a campaign against expansion at Heathrow he replied: 'You bet I will, yes.' Mr Johnson acknowledged that No 10 was 'very cross' about his intervention and refused to rule out seeking a return to the Commons at a by-election to fight any attempt to expand Heathrow. Prominent Tory Zac Goldsmith, a former adviser on the environment to Mr Cameron, said he feared a U-turn on Heathrow was underway. He said this week's removal of Transport Secretary Justine Greening, who was firmly opposed to Heathrow expansion, showed that 'the Government is at least trying to open the door to the possibility of a third runway'. New Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin is said to have an 'open mind' on Heathrow, although his new deputy Simon Burns has in the past described the idea of a third runway as 'environmental vandalism'. In the Commons, Mr Cameron insisted that Government policy had not changed. He said: 'While I believe we need to establish a form of review that will bring parties together and make a decision about airport capacity, I will not be breaking my manifesto pledge.' Ed Miliband said he remained 'sceptical' about the case for a third runway at Britain's only international hub airport. Nick Clegg insisted a third runway 'will not happen' under the Coalition. 'My party's manifesto is against a third runway and the Coalition Agreement could not have been clearer – we have ruled out giving the go-ahead to a runway during this Parliament. It will not happen during this Parliament,' he said. Tory backbencher Tim Yeo, who last week called on Mr Cameron to show whether he is 'a man or a mouse' on airport capacity, said: 'We need more runway capacity in the South East in the 2020s – not in the 2030s.' Shoved out: A sombre Justine Greening (right) leaves No.10 just after David Cameron told her she is no . longer Transport Secretary. Boris Johnson (left) accused ministers of . being bent on a 'simply mad' plan . Expansion: Debate has raged for years over a 3rd runway at Heathrow and the reshuffle intensified speculation there could be a u-turn on the issue . Anger: Tory Zac Goldsmith says he would stand down over the issue as he believes his party must protect those under the Heathrow flight path . Mr .

'It is simply . mad to build a new runway in the middle of West London. 'Nearly a third of the victims of aircraft noise in the whole of Europe live in the vicinity of Heathrow. 'Now it is clear that the Government wants to ditch its promises and send yet more planes over central London. 'The third runway would mean more . traffic, more noise, more pollution – and a serious reduction in the . quality of life for hundreds of thousands of people. We will fight this . all the way.' He told Sky News's Sunrise programme: 'There's lots of stuff been coming out of Whitehall to suggest that a U-turn is in progress and they want to build a third runway at Heathrow - all the pressure from businesses to do the third runway, that's where the Treasury seems to be focusing its hopes. 'I think that is a profound mistake. It is not deliverable, it would do massive environmental damage, not just in West London but for residents accross the city. There are much, much better solutions that will deliver long-term growth and jobs.' Prominent Tory MP Zac Goldsmith told the Today programme: 'I think it’s impossible to pretend that this isn’t a sign, because we haven’t just lost Justine Greening from this Department, we’ve also seen Theresa Villiers moved out – both of whom were absolutely rock solid on this issue in terms of defending what is still the Government’s line officially. 'The Conservative Party made an unambiguous promise before the election, as did the Liberal Democrats – it could not have been clearer; the Coalition Agreement immediately after the election could not have been clearer.' He again reiterated his threat to trigger a by-election if the Government did perform a U-turn. 'I promised people before the election that if the Government performed a U-turn, I would trigger an immediate by-election and that people in this constituency would have a chance to have their say. Absolutely [I stand by that],' he said. Ministers have come under intense . pressure from business to approve a third runway at Heathrow, Britain's . only international hub airport. Some Tories are also calling for a . U-turn, with former minister Tim Yeo saying the issue was a test of . whether the Prime Minister is a 'man or a mouse'. No 10 denied that Miss Greening's removal signalled a shift in aviation policy. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said a planned review of airport capacity would still go ahead. Farewell but not goodbye: Ken Clarke was moved aside as Justice Secretary but will be staying in the cabinet . Supporters of expansion at Heathrow . will be invited to make their case, but the spokesman said the Coalition . agreement, which rules out a third runway before 2015, still stood. But Andy Atkins, executive director of . Friends of the Earth, said Miss Greening had been 'shunted out of her . transport job because of her opposition to a third runway at Heathrow' adding that more airports or runways in the South-East 'would have a . devastating impact on local communities and the environment'. On HS2, Mr McLoughlin will face . opposition from Tory voters who live close to the proposed route. He . will also be under pressure to limit next January's planned 6.2 per cent . rise in rail fares.

Jeff Fleming, pictured, pleaded guilty to battery with a deadly weapon on Thursday. He was accused of shooting a golfer who broke a window in his home with a stray golf ball. Fleming, 53, has expressed remorse and shock over his reaction to the . broken window, Deputy District Attorney Sean Neahusan said. Fleming apparently has no felony . criminal record. 'I'm not sure what was going on, but from what I've read and heard, it definitely sounds out of character,' Neahusan said. The golfer and his partner ran away after the shot was . fired -- and it wasn't until they were safe that the golfer realized he had . been hit, according to police. At least one shotgun pellet had to be removed from the golfer's body at a hospital. He was also treated for minor injuries to an arm . and both legs.

Neahusan also said he's unsure what motivated the shooting and referred . queries about Fleming's mental state to his lawyer, Larry Dunn. Dunn did not immediately return phone calls.

Former investment banker: Lord Freud said many of the poor turned down jobs because they were worried about losing their handouts . Some of the poor are stuck on benefits because they are unwilling to take risks, the welfare minister claimed yesterday. Lord Freud, a former investment banker, said many turned down jobs because they were worried about losing their handouts. Describing the current system as ‘dreadful’, Lord Freud said his reforms would encourage the poor to take risks because they will ensure that, unlike at the moment, work always pays. He added that the welfare system is so complicated that many claimants have no idea which benefits they would keep if they found work. Many also lose so many benefits when they get a job that they end up being worse off, he said. Lord Freud told The House magazine, which is circulated in Parliament, that this discouraged the poor from taking risks. ‘People who are poorer should be prepared to take the biggest risks; they’ve got least to lose,’ he said. ‘We have, through our welfare system, created a system which has made them reluctant to take risks so we need to turn that on its head and make the system predictable so that people will take those risks. I think we have a dreadful welfare system.’ Stress: Lord Freud said the welfare system is so complicated that many claimants have no idea which benefits they would keep if they found work (file picture) He said that the new Universal Credit . payment will simplify the system and ensure those who decide to take a . job do not lose out financially. Lord Freud went on: ‘What we’ve got today is a welfare system that is so complicated, with so many odd, unexpected effects, and so difficult for individuals to predict what will happen if they change their circumstances in some way, that it is really dangerous. 'What we’ve got today is a welfare system . that is so complicated, with so many odd, unexpected effects, and so . difficult for individuals to predict what will happen if they change . their circumstances in some way, that it is really dangerous' Lord Freud . ‘It’s dangerous because if you don’t know how the system will adjust when you change, go to work for instance, it freezes people in immobility.’ The current system encourages people to ‘have a lifestyle off benefits’, he said. Lord Freud defended plans to put a cap on the amount of money a family can have on benefits. ‘The point about the benefit cap is it is making a statement about what are the limits of a welfare system,’ he said. ‘It’s saying that people should not get more by living on welfare than the average person in the country gets from earnings, so it’s a very basic statement around fairness.’ He added: ‘The welfare system is there to support people back to independence; it is not there as a lifestyle choice.’ Challenged over whether he could ever understand the life of a poor person when he earned a fortune as an investment banker, he replied: ‘I think you don’t have to be the corpse to go to a funeral, which is the implied criticism there.’","Former investment banker Lord Freud: Welfare system is too complicated .

A Missouri man who vanished over the summer after leaving suicide notes has been found alive and accused of trying to cover up child sex abuse. Raymond Avett, 45, was charged Wednesday with concealing a felony along with his ex-girlfriend Jennifer Callaway, 34, the mother of the 6-year-old victim. Avett disappeared in June after leaving several letters suggesting that he was planning to end his life. He had recently learned that Callaway's daughter disclosed the alleged sexual abuse. Two of a kind: Raymond Avett (left) was charged with concealing child sex abuse along with his ex-girlfriend Jennifer Callaway (right) Heinous crime: A relative came to Callaway saying that he had discovered a diary written by her 6-year-old daughter stating that Avett had performed a sex act on her . The suspect was not located until mid-July when he was stopped by police in Maryland. Police say he cashed out more than $100,000 from a retirement account,St Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Callaway allegedly forced Avett to give her his home, luxury SUV, boat and life insurance policy naming the child as beneficiary in exchange for her silence. The suspected sex abuse came to light in late May when a family member told Callaway that he had discovered a diary written by her 6-year-old daughter, in which the girl mentioned that Avett had allegedly performed a sex act on her. Following the revelation, the mother moved out of Avett's home, but never reported the alleged sex crime against her daughter. Three weeks later, investigators say Callaway texted her ex-boyfriend that she was going to send him a document he needed to sign within 48 hours to prevent her from going to the authorities. Blackmail plot: Callaway (left) allegedly forced Avett (right) to give her his home, luxury SUV, boat and life insurance policy naming the child as beneficiary in exchange for her silence about the sex crime . Property: Callaway moved into Avett's $120,000 condo in the 3000 block of Flatboat Station . The letter, which Avett received later that day, detailed Callaway’s' demands, stating that her ex-boyfriend must give up his $120,000 condo in the 3000 block of Flatboat Station, his H3 Hummer and his boat called ‘Anita Cocktail.’ Elaborate ruse: Avett vanished in June after leaving behind several suicide notes and abandoning his car by the river, but turned up alive in Maryland three weeks later . As part of the deal, the 45-year-old . suspected molester also had to take out a life insurance policy that . would benefit the 6-year-old girl in case of his death. Avett complied, promptly moving out of his house and handing over his possessions to Callaway June 17. The following day, the man vanished, leaving behind several suicide notes, one of which was found by police inside his Ford Explorer strategically parked near the riverfront. Police had spent three weeks searching for the missing man, increasingly believing he had taken his own life, until he turned up in Maryland July 12. St. Charles County Prosecutor Tim Lohmar said that Avett is not facing child sex abuse charges because his ex-girlfriend had failed to report the alleged crime, making it virtually impossible to get to the bottom of the case. The prosecutor explained that they have no concrete evidence proving that the abuse had taken place beside Avett's apparent willingness to go along with Callaway’s extortion. Avett was ordered held on $250,000 cash bail, while Callaway's bail was set at $200,000.","Raymond Avett, 45, and Jennifer Callaway, 34, the mother of the 6-year-old victim, have been charged with concealing a felony .

An eight-year-old girl suffered horrific injuries after being mauled by dogs while playing in her own back yard. Rescuers alerted by her screams had to pull terrified Broagan McCuaig from the powerful jaws of two American bulldogs. The girl’s parents then endured an agonising wait in hospital as she underwent a seven-hour operation for  ‘serious’ injuries. Witnesses said the dogs grabbed Broagan and shook her like a rag doll as she screamed in pain . Following the incident in Garthamlock, Glasgow, on  Friday afternoon, police seized two American bulldogs and two people were charged under the Dangerous Dogs Act. Last night, Broagan’s parents Tracy Cox and Neil McCuaigh said doctors at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Yorkhill, Glasgow, could not say if she would walk again. Mr McCuaigh said: One of the dogs snapped her ankle. She has had several metal pins inserted to hold the bone straight and a brace to keep her leg straight. ‘She will need to go into theatre several more times this week to keep an eye on it. ‘They don’t know whether she will be able to walk. It’ll be around Christmas time before they can tell us.’ It took two passers-by to rescue her, with one man kicking one dog until it released her, while another carried her inside . Miss Cox said: ‘She’s in intensive . care but she’s stable. She just keeps asking if the dogs have been taken . away. She hasn’t seen herself. 'She asked tonight about her face – she . thinks she looks stupid now but it’s because it’s swollen on the left . side and she can’t open her eye.’ It is understood the incident happened in a gated patio area behind the girl’s flat as she played a game of ‘tig’ with friends. Witnesses said the dogs, which are not an outlawed breed, grabbed Broagan and shook her like a rag doll as she screamed ‘Help me, help me, please can you help me?’. It took two passers-by to rescue her, with one man kicking one dog until it released her, while another carried her inside. Broagan's parents Tracy Cox and Neil McCuaigh said doctors could not say if she would walk again . Neighbour and family friend James Moffat, 44, said his wife Linda, who carried Broagan, covered in blood, upstairs to the girl’s flat on the second floor, was distraught. He said his wife was struggling to sleep and would not be able to forget the scene. Mr Moffat, who is known to Broagan as Uncle James, said: ‘She’s a wee skinny girl, there’s nothing to her, it’s remarkable she’s making a recovery. She’s full of beans, a lively girl. Police seized two American bulldogs and two people were charged under the Dangerous Dogs Act . ‘She’s got the will in her, she will fight back. We’re a close-knit community and we’re all behind each other.’ Broagan’s 17-year-brother Kiefer witnessed the attack. She also has a sister, Denise McIllhatton, 20, who was on holiday in Amsterdam at the time, and a brother, Niall, two. The Scottish Government introduced legislation allowing control orders to be applied to any dog in February 2011. Under the Dangerous Dogs Act, specific breeds are outlawed but it is often difficult to establish whether or not a dog is on the list. Last Monday, the 34-year-old owner of a Staffordshire bull terrier was left in a serious but stable condition after being savaged by the dog in Larkhall, Lanarkshire. Earlier this year, 14-year-old Jade Anderson was mauled to death by four dogs in Wigan, Lancashire. Her family said they were ‘disgusted’ when the dog owner walked free from court with a suspended sentence last Friday. Glasgow Provan Labour MSP Paul Martin called for a more ‘robust regime’ to deal with owners who used dogs to ‘put themselves in charge of the local community’. He said: ‘Kids should be able to live in their local community without fear. Pledging to raise the issue at Holyrood, he added: ‘We have to decide if these types of dogs should exist. Questions must be asked about their nature and tendency to attack.’ A Police Scotland spokesman said: ‘An eight-year-old girl suffered serious facial injuries after being bitten by two dogs believed to be American bulldog types in Garthamlock, Glasgow, at 5pm on Friday. ‘The girl was taken to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children where she is being treated for her injuries. Both dogs involved have been seized. A male aged 34 and a female aged 33 have been charged under the Dangerous Dogs Act.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Broagan McCuaig was shaken 'like a ragdoll' by two American bulldogs .

The mega-club is threatening to overtake gambling as Las Vegas' most lucrative draw-card, with nearly 30 per cent of casino-goers preferring to dance than bet. Analysts say gambling is no longer king in post-recession Sin City, as a new influx of younger tourists spends less on the slots and more on luxury shopping, concerts and clubbing. Desperate to cash in on the emerging 'club bubble', casino programmers are fiercely competing to . offer novelties that party-goers would never see at their local dance . spot. Club bubble: Sin City now boasts 21 of America's 100 most profitable nightclubs, including the five-story Hakkasan at the MGM Grand . This shift in the structure of the Vegas economy began about 10 years ago but has recently accelerated, according to Center for Business and Economic Research director Stephen P. A. Brown. While Vegas' sprawling casinos . accounted for 59 per cent of total revenue on the Strip in 1984, . gambling contributed just 36 per cent last year. Even . though more visitors than ever are hitting Vegas, they are spending . less money per trip - $1,021 per visit in 2012 compared with $1,318 in . 2007. 'Gaming went down more than total visitor spending, by a greater percentage,' Brown told New York Times. 'The visitors who have come back are here for clubs and shopping. They’re buying swimsuits to go to the day clubs and evening clothes to go to the nightclubs. That’s the big growth. 'I think what’s going on here is we’re seeing a shift away from Las Vegas as the only gaming destination in the United States to being one of many gaming destinations. But it is holding up as a tourist destination.' Some of the biggest casino owners which are . saddled with debt, including MGM and Caesars Palace, are tapping into . the booming nightclub business to attract more tourists. Vegas now boasts 21 of the country's . 100 most profitable nightclubs, according to the trade publication . Nightclub & Bar. Game-changer: Nearly 30 per cent of casino-goers now eschew wagering, and Vegas' growing mega-clubs are threatening to become the most lucrative draw for a town built on betting . The town also dominates the top 10 spots, with . seven clubs bringing in more than $25 million a year. The other three . clubs with earnings in the same range are LIV and Mango's Tropical Cafe . in Miami Beach, and LAVO in New York City. But New York Times reported Vegas officials are worried the 'club bubble' could be nothing more than a flash in the pan that will hurt the city in the long-run. In the meantime, clubs are ramping up their efforts with more extravagant shows and big-name performers. 'Clubs want to add an extra element of wow,' Mary Canavan, owner of the laser company YLS Entertainment Inc, said. 'It used to be you were lucky to have two lasers on your show. Now you might have 26.' Pauly Freedman, director of operations for Encore Beach Club, Surrender and Andrea's at the Wynn Las Vegas, said clubs are offering the 'full package'. 'The DJs come in and they have their music, but they're also bringing lighting directors in,' he said. 'So it's up to us when we're working alongside them to make sure we have the latest and greatest in our clubs.' Last month, Surrender distributed 3D glasses at the door so dancers could take in the graphics popping out from behind DJ Morgan Page. Freedman is currently awaiting a new LED wall making its way on a boat from China. He promises it will be the brightest in the city. Cashing in: Casino programmers are making club events more and more extravagant to attract tourists. Last month, Surrender distributed 3D glasses at the door so dancers could take in the graphics popping out from behind DJ Morgan Page . At Flutter Fetti, which provides confetti for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the new thing this year is canons that sync automatically to a DJ's music, so that dancers are covered in metallic strips just as the track reaches its climax. 'Casinos need to create a celebration, and our products create the celebration,' CEO Ronee Holmes said. Several clubs are investing in individual confetti canons, cardboard tubes that range from $1 to $6 each. Hakkasan at MGM Grand likes to give a tube to everyone who walks in the door, Holmes said. Ghostbar at the Palms has purchased branded confetti throwers emblazoned with the club's name. Canavan's laser installations might cost a club $9,000 for the night, but with table service starting at $10,000 at many Las Vegas venues, it's a small investment. Of course, everyone has a competitor. The laser vendors are worried about clubs embracing CO2 as an alternative stimulus overload. Many clubs have begun periodically spraying bursts of icy air into the faces of sweaty dancers. For the confetti contingent, the concern is indoor fireworks. Luckily, most casinos still ban those.","Mega-clubs are threatening to overtake gambling as Las Vegas' most lucrative draw-card .

Cherie Blair said employers should be encouraged to create more part-time and family-friendly jobs . Cherie Blair has called for stay-at-home mothers to get Government-funded training and subsidised salaries to help them get back to work and boost the economy. The wife of former prime minister Tony Blair said more women could get back on the ‘ramp into employment’ if the state offered support in the first six months of their return to work. Mrs Blair suggested ‘returnerships’, which would be ‘like an apprenticeship but for those who have been out of the labour market due to caring responsibilities’. And she said employers should be encouraged to create more part-time and family-friendly jobs to encourage women to return, boosting the national workforce. In an essay for the charity 4Children, the barrister wrote: ‘The businesses that get these measures right – in a world in which human capital matters more and more – will win the battle for talent. ‘Helping families, especially mothers, back on the “ramp” into employment … has to be a priority.’ The mother-of-four said that her own experiences had led her to campaign for more jobs that allow women to care for their families and work at the same time. ‘I was so intent as a young lawyer on beating the men at their own game that I didn’t take any real maternity leave with my three younger children,’ she wrote. ‘It is only looking back that I realise I wasn’t beating the system but reinforcing it.’ There are currently two million women and around 200,000 men out of work because of caring responsibilities. Two thirds say they stay home out of choice. 'Returnerships', which would be 'like an apprenticeship but for those who have been out of the labour market due to caring responsibilities' Mrs Blair, 59, said a bigger change is needed in ‘the culture of work’ so that women don’t miss out on opportunities:  ‘Many of the big decisions over progression, promotion and future career trajectory are taken when people are in their late twenties and thirties, putting women at a huge disadvantage because this is the very time they are most likely to be having a break to have children. ‘But changing our society so  our workplaces are truly open  to the talents and life choices of women, and indeed people of all backgrounds, needs real leadership and effort.’ In her essay Mrs Blair suggested introducing back-to-work schemes for men and women who have been caring for their children could be key to economic recovery. ‘At a time when boosting economic growth is at the top of every politician’s “to do” list, this would be a good place to start,’ she said. Mrs Blair said her views are influenced by her mother’s work ethic. ‘[She] gave up her career as an actress to look after my sister and me, was abandoned by her husband and, with no maintenance forthcoming, took a job in a fish and chip shop to support us,’ she said. ‘This experience, as well as my professional ambition, instilled in me a strong feeling that maintaining a career and a family life was both desirable and necessary.’","Called for stay-at-home mothers to get Government-funded training and subsidised salaries to help them get back to work and boost the economy .

Thousands of children as young as eight years old have been caught with alcohol by police, highlighting the disturbing problem of child binge drinking. Police in Burnley, Lancashire, have stopped more than 2,000 youngsters for drinking alcohol on the streets and in parks while others, including a 10-year-old boy, were admitted to casualty because of alcohol consumption. In a photo released by the force, officers are shown standing next to a haul of 280 litres of alcohol, the equivalent of 492 pints, which was seized by underage drinkers during a three-month operation. Young drinkers: Lancashire Police seized 266 litres of beer and cider and 13 litres of spirits from 2,000 children as young as eight years old . Lancashire police said that the eight year old boy who was stopped by the police was issued with a 'protecting vulnerable people' referral. From July to September this year, 266 litres of beer and cider and 14 litres of spirits were confiscated from children found in possession of alcohol. In the three month period, 2,193 youngsters were spoken to, 154 licensed premises were visited, 76 youth referrals were issued, 54 young people were taken home by police, 23 youths were collected by their parents, six arrests were made, five cannabis warnings were handed out, seven fixed penalty notices were given and there were also two directions to leave issued. The operation was mounted after figures . revealed 184 children had been admitted to hospital in Burnley and . neighbouring Blackburn for alcohol-related problems in the last three . years. Officers from the . Special Constabulary worked alongside local neighbourhood policing . teams in a bid to combat anti-social behaviour by targeting underage and . vulnerable youths drinking alcohol. Problem: Royal Blackburn Hospital where children have been taken to casualty after they had been drinking . Labour Councillor Tony Harrison, Burnley Council’s executive member for community services, said: 'The amount of alcohol seized from children in this operation is worrying and makes you wonder where they get it from. 'Residents across our borough are suffering from anti-social behaviour fuelled by alcohol and they will be glad to see operations like this taking place to tackle the problem. 'Burnley Council will continue to work with the police and other partners to deal with the issues surrounding underage drinking but we need support from parents and other adults, and shops that sell alcohol, to prevent it getting into the hands of children in the first place.' Specials Inspector Luke Davis, of Lancashire Police said: 'Underage drinking is something that we will continue to tackle through the CAN operation and I am happy that we have managed to confiscate such a large amount of alcohol that could have been drank by underage teens with potentially dangerous consequences. Treatment: Burnley General Hospital, where children had stomach pumped or were admitted because of physical injuries they had suffered as a result of alcohol consumption . 'We know that underage drinking can make youngsters very vulnerable and this operation isn’t just about punishing those found to be drinking below the legal age limit, it’s as much about protecting them from getting into harmful situations and causing a nuisance to other members of the community. 'I would advise adults and parents not to buy children alcohol as there are all sorts of dangers and risks that come from providing them with it. 'We will continue to tackle this issue by running the CAN initiative.' Labour Councillor Janice Hanson, Lancashire County Council cabinet member for public protection, said: 'Alcohol misuse can present health risks and cause careless behaviour in all age groups, but is even more dangerous for young people. 'Because young people’s bodies are still growing, alcohol can interfere with their development, making them particularly vulnerable to the long-term damage caused by alcohol. 'Drinking alcohol lowers people’s inhibitions, and makes them more likely to do things they wouldn’t normally do. Young people are particularly at risk because, at their stage of life, they are still testing the boundaries of what is acceptable behaviour. 'For example, young people may go further than they wanted to in a sexual experience after drinking alcohol. In the most serious cases, it could lead to them becoming the victim of a sexual assault.' Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act show 69 under-18s were admitted to Royal Blackburn or Burnley General hospitals in 2010. The figure rose to 71 the following year but last year the figure fell to 44 - although one of the casualties was a 10-year-old boy. These children may have had their stomachs pumped after binge drinking while others suffered physical injuries as a result of alcohol consumption.","Officers in Burnley, Lancashire caught 2,000 youngsters drinking .

Sir Stephen House, Chief Constable for Scotland has provoked mixed reaction from colleagues for his pro-active approach to policing . The most senior police officer in Scotland has been warned against making arrests - because of fears that he is putting himself at unnecessary risk by enforcing the law. It comes after Sir Stephen House flagged down a motorist on the M8 near Glasgow as he was travelling on a police motorcyle. He was later joined by traffic officers but this apparently was not enough to justify the risk to his personal safety. It is not the first time Sir Stephen has intervened to tackle motorists he suspects of drink-driving or speeding. Last week Police Scotland told The Sunday Times that the Chiref Constable 'regularly undertakes journeys in uniform ... on a marked police motorbike.' They added: 'The chief constable has on occasion had reason to deal with members of the public when issues such as driver behaviour have come to his attention.' Although some of applauded Sir Stephen on his hands-on attitude to policing others have questioned whether his actions are appropriate given his level of seniority and in their statement . Police Scotland refused to give details of exactly what he had done. There is a worry that by carrying out policing without backup from his colleagies Sir Stephen could leave himself open to bogus complaints from a member of the public. Although this is an issue faced daily by rank-and-file officers some believe that given his position it is a risk that the Chief Constable need not take. Graeme Pearson, a former police officer who is now a Labour MSP and member of the Scottish parliament’s justice sub-committee on policing, told The Sunday Times that not only was he concerned about that vulnerablity of the Chief Constable but also that he ought to find better uses for his time. He said: 'I understand the concerns expressed by police officers about their chief constable acting in this way, particularly given he is head of the national service. 'Without a colleague on hand, Sir Stephen could find himself in difficulties not only in terms of a complaint but also in circumstances that escalate at the roadside as a result of his intervention. 'I would always expect a police officer to intervene when a crime is being committed or life is at risk, but if the chief constable has the time to stop speeding motorists instead of calling in road patrol, I think on his salary he would be better occupied dealing with the many strategic issues facing his staff and the public.' Sir Stephen is well renowned within the police force for his enthusiasm for street policing. When he became Chief constable of Strathclyde police, which was previously Scotlan's largest police force, in 2007 he continued to regularly go out on patrol. Newly Appointed: Chief Constable Sir Stephen, pictured last year, earns £208,000 a year leading some critics to question whether pulling over speeding motorists is the best use of his time . He is also thought to have joined his colleagues in a policing of a march by members of the far-right Scottish Defence League in Edinburgh last August. But despite concerns Sir Stephen, who earns £208,000 a year, has been congratualted on his actions be senior officers. David O’Connor, president of the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents, said: 'Police officers can work in pairs for reasons of corroboration and health and safety, but you take the oath and you’re expected to do the job. 'Our mission is to keep people safe and if you’re on duty, in uniform, and see something that needs dealing with, it would be remiss not do so and could impact on public confidence. 'I think it’s laudable we have a chief constable who is highly visible. There are many police officers who carry out their duties alone.' And it appears Sir Stephen is not alone in his proactive stance - in June, Dave Jones, the new chief constable of North Yorkshire police, was applauded for chasing suspected criminals through Richmond town centre on his first day in the job.","Sir Stephen House was alone when he flagged down a motorist on the M8 near Glasgow as he was travelling on a police motorcyle .

The Essex officer’s self-sacrifice was honoured at the Police Bravery Awards, organised by the Police Federation of England and Wales. Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May joined dozens of police officers at the annual event in Central London. Among them were frontline officers who tackled armed robbers, rescued people from burning buildings and dived in freezing water to save drowning children. Mr Cameron said it is ‘humbling’ to read the extraordinary acts of heroism undertaken by officers in the line of duty. ‘Every single day, around our country, the police put themselves in harm’s way to keep us safe,’ he said. ‘Without the rule of law, there is no freedom worth its name – and it is right that we recognise the work of those who do so much to uphold it.’ ‘Britain’s police are the best in the world, ordinary men and women who do extraordinary things.’ Theresa May honoured Pc Dibell at the London event .

Aliens may have travelled from beyond the stars to make first contact - choosing Shipley in West Yorkshire to unveil their existence to humanity. What appears to be a UFO hovers above the scenic skyline of the town in this picture taken by chance by local man Emil Ziemczonek. He took some pictures of his local neighbourhood to show to a friend, and it was only when he looked back at the image later that he spotted the eerie sight. The 24-year-old said: 'I could clearly see that there was a UFO in the picture. The residents of a Yorkshire town are seemingly not alone after a saucer-shaped object appeared in the skies above them. 'I didn't see it when I was taking it, but that's probably because it was moving so fast at the time. 'Some people are calling me crazy but I don't think there's anything else it could be.' Mr Ziemczonek, a manufacturer at the nearby Denso plant, was travelling back to his home just after 10am last Sunday October 6, when the flying saucer was also seemingly on the move. He said: 'I've got a friend coming to visit from London and I wanted to show him how beautiful the landscape is around here. 'Only something from space looks that strange, it's not the right size or colour for a bird or a plane. 'I do believe in UFOs, I have never seen one before but I will certainly be looking out for them all the time from now on.' Emil Ziemcszonek believes he photographed a UFO in the skies above the town as he took a snap to show a friend the area's natural beauty. A website called www.uforth.com documents UFO sightings and sorts them into different categories and shapes. The mystery object photographed could fall into one of the most common categories of alien spacecraft. The site shows pictures similar to the one taken by Mr Ziemczonek and states: 'Of all known craft, the domed disc is perhaps the most instantly recognisable, and has been portrayed countless times in the media, but in reality the shiny silver disc so often represented is one of its many variants.' Mr Ziemczonek admits that many suspect that he has altered the picture for effect - a claim he adamantly denies. 'A lot of people have asked whether something has been done to the picture, but of course not,' he said. 'I'm absolutely amazed, and I think it's interesting to think there could be other life out there.'","Mysterious craft appears in photograph of beauty spot .

With their well-pressed shirts and Cath Kidston totes at the ready, these shoppers look like they're waiting patiently for the farmers' market to open, or perhaps a new branch of Boden. In fact, the queuers - all 300 of them - are waiting for a new Aldi store to open - the discount supermarket that has become the darling of the recession-hit middle classes. Demonstrating perfectly how the well-heeled have taken the German chain to their hearts, they parked their Aston Martins, Jaguars and Range Rovers and then queued politely from 3am for the opening of the supermarket in Knutsford, in Cheshire. Cath Kidston totes at the ready: Middle-class shoppers queued round the block for the new Aldi in Knutsford . An Aston Martin was among the expensive cars parked outside the budget German supermarket . Affluent locals in Knutsford, once dubbed Tory Utopia, were keen to get their hands on an Aldi bargain . Having an Aldi, which does not do internet delivery, nearby is now something to be proud of rather than ashamed, and the Cheshire set were happy to wait in line for the no-frills supermarket to open its doors. Locals in the town, deep in Chancellor George Osborne's solidly middle-class constituency of Tatton, Cheshire, rejected Aldi when it tried to open a supermarket there in 2008. But times have changed. Voted both Grocer Of The Year and Supermarket Of The Year last month, Aldi is now a shop to be seen in, with those in the know boasting of their finds there. It does not stock any of the big brands like Hellmann's or Kellogg's, but it has won awards for the taste and quality of its own brand alternatives, which come at a fraction of the price. Middle-class shoppers flock to Aldi for its Prosecco, its rose wine, and its seeded bread.  Its cleaning products are also highly regarded, as is its gin. Bargains: Shopper Judith Crouch was one of thousands who went to Knutsford Aldi's first day of business . Shoppers at the new Knutsford Aldi were quick to stock up its award-winning Prosecco, right, and foods . What to buy: The Grocer magazine named Aldi Grocer Of The Year and gave 16 products a coveted gold medal . The Knutsford shoppers knew all this: more than 2,500 people visited the new Aldi on its first day of business, hundreds of whom had queued since dawn to be sure of getting in when the doors opened at 8am. Staff arriving for their first day trading were surprised to see the queue snaking round the car park, and handed out Willy Wonka-style golden envelopes containing prizes to the first 100 people in line. There were also prizes of Prosecco and flowers, televisions and hampers, as well as samples of its award-winning range of foods. Store manager Mike Taylor said: . 'There has been a hugely positive response from the Knutsford community . to the opening of our new store, and it was so pleasing to see hundreds . of shoppers queueing outside before 8am. Gleaming cars waited in the car park - Knutsford is known for the affluence of its 13,000 inhabitants . Affluent Knutsford, in Cheshire's Golden Triangle, rejected Aldi in 2008 but has embraced it now . Aldi has seen sales rise by 31.5 per cent this year, outpacing Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons.  It keeps its overheads down with minimalist store interiors, few staff, and charged-for plastic bags. The supermarket has made a huge effort to attract the middle classes, introducing a range of superior products at budget prices on olive oils, spirits, wine, coffee, and Aberdeen Angus steaks. Its own-brand Champagne, gin and Prosecco have all won awards, while many of its wines have been hailed by critics. With its wine bars and designer boutiques, affluent Knutsford is the epitome of comfortable, aspirational Tory Britain - the perfect location for a new Aldi. Desirable: Knutsford lies within George Obsborne's Tatton constituency and is a sought-after place to live . Lying within the Cheshire Golden Triangle of villages favoured by celebrities and entrepreneurs, Knutsford is surrounded by rolling countryside but also just 15 miles from Manchester and five miles from its airport. With 13,000 inhabitants, the leafy town is staunchly Conservative, barring a blip from 1997 to 2001 when independent former television journalist Martin Bell stole the seat of Tatton from Tory Neil Hamilton, in disgrace over the cash for questions row. George Osborne won the Tatton seat back for the Conservatives in 2001 and has held it ever since. Popular local events include the RHS Tatton flower show, and the Cheshire County Show in nearby Tabley.","Well-heeled locals queue as budget supermarket opens in Knutsford .

Britain is being flooded with tonnes of a potentially dangerous stimulant drug in a last minute ‘gold rush’ before it is banned. These pictures show how dealers are racing to cash in on the thriving market for khat before it is made illegal next year. In just one delivery last week 160,000 sticks of the mind-bending drug were delivered to a warehouse in Southall, West London. A large delivery of 160,000 sticks of khat arrives at a warehouse in Southall, West London, from Kenya . Every week it receives four deliveries from Kenya, thought to be worth a total of almost £2m, with each stick selling for £3 and a box of 40 costing £35. There are believed to be several other importers in Britain, profiting from a thriving but little-known trade estimated to be worth at least £80million a year. The capital’s Somali community is one of the biggest markets for the plant which is chewed to deliver a stimulant rush. Officials fear chaos next year when the drug is outlawed in line with other countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, France and the U.S. In July, Home Secretary Theresa May said she will make it a class C drug after hearing concerns it could be linked to mental illness and psychosis. Those caught possessing it will face up to two years in prison, the same penalty as users of anabolic steroids and ketamine. The drug, pictured at the warehouse, is sold in the UK for £3 per stick and creates a high when chewed . There are also concerns that the trade helps support Al Shabaab, an Al-Qaeda-inspired group behind the recent Nairobi mall atrocity. Campaigner Abukar Awale, a former addict, said: ‘There is a big gold rush going. Every one of them is rushing to sell as much khat as they can before the ban comes in. ‘My concern is that, as it is legal, people think it is safe. It destroys people. The Home Office is protecting vulnerable communities. Every week the warehouse, pictured, receives four deliveries from Kenya, thought to be worth a total of almost £2m . ‘Khat took seven years of my life. Days become months, months become years. I lost my confidence and became aggressive and paranoid. ‘This is what khat does to a young man. Its availability in cafes segregates Somali youngsters from wider society.’ Khat is a flowering shrub that produces a mild high when chewed and is popular in Somalia and across the Horn of Africa. It is harvested early in the morning, sorted and then wrapped in banana leaves to keep fresh ready for use. Users chew the bitter oval leaves and young shoots of the plant, swallowing juice and storing the residue in their cheek. They contain the drug cathinone, an addictive stimulant with effects similar to but less intense than that of methamphetamine or cocaine. The main effects are euphoria and stimulation but the side effects can include disorientation, hallucination and hyperactivity. Campaigners believe the drug may be linked to mental and make users more vulnerable to being influenced by fundamentalists who peddle it. Experts estimate there are dozens of khat cafes across Britain where young men chew the drug in relative privacy. Many supporters say it does little harm and the vast majority of users lead ordinary lives and provide for their families. News of the scale of its use emerged as Miss May is sued by a khat supplier, who has the backing of the Kenyan Government. Theresa May announced in July that the drug is being outlawed in line with other countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, France and the U.S. Documents lodged at the High Court claim the ban breaches the human rights of khat users and said Miss May should have followed advice to keep the drug legal. The decision to ban khat in Britain caused uproar in Kenya where it is an important source of export income and supports thousands of farmers. In July, Miss May said she feared Britain has become an international hub for khat trafficking. She said: ‘Failure to take decisive action and change the UK’s legislative position would place the UK at a serious risk of becoming a single, regional hub for the illegal onward trafficking of khat. ‘The Government is concerned that we risk underestimating the actual harms of khat in our communities owing to the limitations of the evidence base available.’","Last week 160,000 sticks of khat - a flowering shrub that produces a high when chewed - were delivered to a warehouse in Southall, West London .

A teenager who ‘killed’ his best friend when he crashed his driving instructor father’s dual control car while drunk driving has been jailed. Marc Lutman, 19, was nearly two and half times over the alcohol limit when he lost control of the speeding car with Ian Deer, also 19, in the passenger seat. Undergraduate student Lutman gave in to Mr Deer’s requests for a 1am drive of his father’s instructor vehicle after they were both thrown out of a party for being ‘worse for wear,’ a court heard. Mr Lutman, a student at Leicester University, did not have insurance or permission to drive the vehicle which belonged to his father, Phillip. Just ten minutes into their nightly journey, Mr Lutman lost control of the silver Vauxhall Corsa while speeding over the 60mph limit going down a rural road near their homes in Stickney, Lincolnshire. Shortly before the crash Mr Deer had pressed the dual controls and pulled Mr Lutman’s arm away from the steering wheel, Lincoln Crown Court heard. Mr Deer, from Revesby, Lincolnshire, was not wearing a seat belt and was thrown from the vehicle as it flew over 80 metres in to a field. He died from his injuries despite Lutman’s efforts to give him first aid. Lutman flagged down a passing taxi driver and called 999. When police arrived he was still trying to save his friend. Mark Knowles, prosecuting, said Lutman admitted to being the driver and was overheard to say ‘What have I done, I’ve killed my best friend.’ Tests later showed he was nearly two and half times over the drink drive limit with a reading of 84 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath compared with the legal level of 35. The court heard Lutman was an ‘exemplary student’ with no previous convictions. Alison Summers, mitigating, said a custodial sentence would inevitably lead to the end of his University career, but added it was clear from text messages sent by Mr Deer that it was his idea to take the car keys. One text message sent in reply to Mr Deer from a friend even read ‘Oh dear. This won’t go well.’ Behind bars: Marc Lutman was sentenced to 40 months in a young offenders institution at Lincoln Crown Court . Miss Summers said: ‘At the time that message was sent Mr Deer was in the driver’s seat and he was going to drive to McDonald’s.’ Lutman eventually gave in and drove off himself. ‘Both were in high spirits. Mr Lutman says Mr Deer pressed the dual controls, ‘Miss Summers added. ‘There was some tom foolery. Mr Lutman says Mr Deer pulled his arm away from the steering wheel. A short time later he lost control and went in to the field.’ The court heard Mr Deer’s mother, Christine, who sat in the public gallery during the hearing, did not blame Lutman for the crash and met him the day before he appeared in court to be sentenced. Miss Summers added: ‘It is testament to Christine Deer that she does not blame the defendant when he blames nobody but himself.’ Lutman, of East Keal Fen, Lincolnshire admitted causing death by careless driving while over the drink-drive limit following the crash on 30 August last year. Passing sentence Judge Michael Heath said Mr Deer had contributed to the crash with some of his actions but there could be no alternative to a custodial sentence for the driver. Lutman was sentenced to 40 months in a young offenders institution in a young offenders institution, banned from driving for five years and ordered to take an extended driving test. Judge Heath told Lutman he could have said ‘No’ to his friend on several occasions. ‘This is a case of youthful folly fuelled by alcohol with tragic consequences,’ Judge Heath added. ‘The attitude of Mrs Deer to what you have done and to you is remarkable.’","Marc Lutman, 19, was two-and-a-half times the limit when car crashed .

House proud: Kirstie Allsopp said the Swedish home store is good at what it does but hampers traditions . Ikea is creating a ‘throwaway culture’ that has destroyed the art of homemaking, according to Kirstie Allsopp. The 42-year-old TV presenter said families no longer passed down furniture to the next generation and instead were too quick to dispose of household items. ‘I have nothing against IKEA but ultimately it encourages this buy and throwaway culture which we live in,’ she said. ‘It also encourages people to have homes which all look the same’. Miss Allsopp hosts Location, Location, Location, in which she scours the country in search of the perfect home for buyers. She said Ikea was ‘very good at what it does’, but had helped kill the tradition of passing on furniture. ‘At one time people would get married or move in together and a member of family would give you an item or a piece of furniture to start your home,’ she said. ‘It was never a case of we will buy all new, and it is a shame. ‘The great thing about handing things down is the history and the story behind objects. ‘I would be horrified if any of my children felt the need to go and buy a chest of drawers because they would have absolutely no need. ‘They have been brought up to appreciate great furniture so I hope they would never shop there.’ She said there is ‘something wonderful’ about unearthing furniture in antique stores, second hand shops or at auction. Miss Allsopp, has two sons – Bay, seven, and Oscar, five – with her partner, property developer Ben Andersen, 51. They also share custody of his sons from his previous marriage, Orion and Hal. The family live in London during the week and spend weekends at a rural retreat in north Devon. Speaking to promote B&Q’s Textile Trade In, in which shoppers can donate unwanted cushions and curtains that will be passed on to the British Heart Foundation, she also confessed to having obsessive tendencies on all matters home-related. ‘I’m very particular about where I have cushions in my home and how plumped they are,’ she said. ‘With the cushions, my partner and the kids are allowed to touch them but I like to encourage otherwise. Blasted: Ikea is known for its affordable, flat-pack furniture and home sets. But Kirstie is not such a big fan . Miss Allsopp - who has two sons with her partner and shares custody of his other two - prefers heritage . ‘With the sofa, I will sometimes get an idea of where I want it in the middle of the night and you will find me moving it around. ‘I think my OCD [obsessive compulsive disorder] ways are challenged by toys – I want to keep them all in boxes in a particular corner. However I have accepted over time that it isn’t going to work that way. ‘My wardrobe is coded in terms of styles, I have certain styles of dresses which have to hang together. So if I have the same dress in a variety of colours they all hang together. ‘I also have a thing about straightening picture frames. Always straightening picture frames. ‘I suppose I am just extremely house proud.’ IKEA first opened in 1958 in Sweden and has become popular in Britain with its affordable, self-assembly furniture. The Location Location Location presenter said: 'I would be horrified if any of my children felt the need to go and buy a chest of drawers because they would have absolutely no need.' She raised them to 'appreciate furniture' Miss Allsopp has written two books – Kirstie’s Homemade Home and Kirstie Allsopp Craft – on how to create furniture and fabrics for your home. Her advice on interiors ranges from how to make a canopy for your bed out of a wedding veil, to how to make a memory box out of an unused cabinet. In her interview she said she would give up her work ‘in a heartbeat’ for the sake of being a mother. ‘My home will always be more important than my role on the television,’ she said. ‘I have a team of five people around me helping me ensure I fulfil that role at home. ‘If I had to give it all up because my children missed out on their mum I would because they are more important to me.

Henry Stangroom, 21, suffered fatal stab wounds to the heart and lung in the attack at his Clapham home . A young chef was stabbed to death just months after he escaped prison for killing a teenager in a hit-and-run. The body of Henry Stangroom, 21, was discovered with fatal stab wounds to the heart and lung at his home in trendy Clapham, South-West London. A 30-year-old man, believed to be his flatmate, was discovered at the scene with neck injuries after apparently attempting to kill himself. He was taken to a South London hospital where he was arrested on suspicion of murder, the Met said last night. It is understood that the suspected murderer is being examined for mental health problems. Last year, Mr Stangroom escaped jail after killing a 19-year-old man in a horrific hit and run accident on a rural road in Hampshire. He drove three miles in a severely damaged car claiming he was not aware he had hit and killed 19-year-old Jack Bland. He was sentenced to a suspended eight month prison term after admitting dangerous driving as a judge said his actions ‘beggared belief’. Detectives believe Mr Stangroom was killed early last week in Lavender Sweep, a short distance from Clapham Junction railway station. The young man, who worked as a pub chef in Greenwich, on the other side of the capital, moved into the property after his older sister Michelle moved out last year. His body was discovered by police officers who broke down the front door shortly before 9pm on Thursday night. Neighbours said the victim’s sister pleaded for help to get inside the flat before his body was discovered by police. One man said: ‘My housemate had a friend visiting from Australia for two weeks. She heard the doorbell ringing but she ignored it because it wasn't her place. ‘But after a while she went downstairs and there was this hysterical girl who begged her to help her get into the flat saying, ""my brother's in there, he needs help."" ‘They called the police who came and said there was no sign of life in the flat, to keep her back, and then the rest of the emergency services showed up.’ The man added that detectives believe Mr Stangroom may have been dead for more than a day before they found him. Detectives believe Mr Stangroom was killed early last week in Lavender Sweep, Clapham (pictured) Candida Wooldridge, 26, who shares a house with Michelle, said her family is ‘dealing with a horrible thing’. She said: ‘Michelle does not live here anymore, she might be coming back, but after what happened she is understandably spending time at home.’ Neighbours said young people often gathered at the ground-floor flat for noisy late night parties. They were shocked to discover that a murder had taken place and feared the victim may have lain undiscovered for some time. Bennedict Austen, 75, said: ‘I feel so scared and frightened. I've had trouble sleeping since Thursday, I haven't been myself, I feel like I've been going potty. ‘Seeing all that going on, seeing the body bag being fetched out, it was like Midsomer Murders. ‘This is such a nice street, lots of lovely people who work and have high-paid jobs or work in TV. I have lived here for 25 years and I have never seen anything like this. ‘They have come and spoiled it now. You don't know what people are like once they have locked their doors.’ Metropolitan Police detectives have arrested a 30-year-old man on suspicion of murder . Speaking about the flat, she added: ‘You couldn't keep tabs, there were too many people always coming and going in and out. ‘They were very noisy, drinking and all that. Sometimes they were in the back garden, they would laugh loudly and drink all day in the summer.’ Mr Bland was killed by Mr Stangroom as he walked home from a wedding reception along the A287 in Odiham, Hampshire, on September 11, 2011. He was found by a taxi driver but died hours later in hospital. Mr Stangroom, who had three penalty points for speeding, was criticised for driving home after his car was badly damaged. He claimed he thought he had hit a deer and refused to answer questions at an inquest as he did not want to further incriminate himself. His ground-floor flat has been boarded-up with perforated metal sheeting after forensic teams finished their work. Bags of rubbish and items of clothing are strewn across the front of the house, with empty McDonalds cartons and other refuse piled up by the door. A Met spokesman said: ‘Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with this investigation at this time. ‘Detectives believe the arrested man was known to the deceased.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Henry Stangroom suffered fatal stab wounds to his heart and lung .

Scroll down for video . Scary: A Buenos Aires commuter train, pictured, slammed into the bumper at the end of the line Saturday at the same station in Argentina's capital where 52 people were killed in a similar crash last year . Police in riot gear then took control of the Once station after the angry crowd broke glass and threw stones in the street outside. At least 80 people were injured, including an 8-year-old boy, according to the Security Secretariat. Of those, five people had broken bones, but none of the wounds were life-threatening, said Security Secretary Sergio Berni. Some of the injured here hit by shattered glass from the train's windows, he said. Berni said it was too early to say why the train failed to stop, crashing through the bumper at the end of the line and ending up wedged between the floor and ceiling of the platform. One end of the huge iron hydraulic bumper that protects the end of the line was driven deep into the train car, while the other end was lifted over the platform and jammed into the turnstiles. Transportation Minister Florencio Randazzo said that driver Julio Benitez had registered negative for alcohol during a routine test before his work shift. Injuries: At least 80 people were injured, including an 8-year-old boy, according to the Security Secretariat. Of those, five people had broken bones, but none of the wounds were life-threatening . The newspaper Clarin quoted Randazzo as saying the driver had taken the disc from the security camera that recorded the accident but police later confiscated it from him. He also said President Cristina Fernandez knew nothing about the accident because she was in strict repose after her recent head surgery. Jorge Ramirez, a 47-year-old cook, entered the train's second car nine stations before the end of the line. He told The Associated Press that the driver overshot several platforms and had to go in reverse before opening the doors, and that he bypassed one station altogether. Other passengers, however, said that the train seemed to be proceeding correctly. 'This is all a tragedy. I saw people hurt, shouting, others thrown on the floor. The people in the first wagon ended up piled on top of each other,"" Ramirez said. Not again: The crash happened at Once station in Buenos Aires where 52 people were killed in a similar crash last year . 'Murderer': A mob quickly formed, unleashing its fury at the train operators. Passengers chanted 'murderer, murderer!' at the injured driver through the shattered cabin window . Berni said some of the injured were waiting on the platform and were hit by glass as the train's windows shattered. Firefighters, police and medical personnel evacuated the wrecked train, but many passengers didn't wait, kicking out windows to escape cars whose doors were stuck. 'Suddenly the train wasn't stopping. It came off the rails and crashed into the ceiling, which stopped it. Then an impressive cloud of smoke came out,' said Maxi Jaquet, who sells hot dogs in the station. 'We ran and began to help.' The Sarmiento line is the busiest commuter rail line serving Argentina's capital and is usually packed with passengers. The February 2012 crash killed 52 people and injured hundreds as the following cars crumpled. Saturday's accident caused less damage to other cars in the formation and happened shortly after 7 a.m. on a weekend morning, so the toll was not as severe.","The Buenos Aires train slammed into the bumper at the end of the line Saturday at the same station 52 people were killed in a crash last year .

But, according to experts, stay-at-home mothers are facing an increasingly vicious backlash by those who think they are lazy, stupid and unattractive. A top academic has said full-time mothers are now subjected to ‘motherism’ - a prejudice that in many circles was unspoken but highly damaging. Bedtime reading: But according to experts, stay-at-home mums are facing an increasingly vicious backlash by those who think they are lazy, stupid and unattractive . Dr Aric Sigman attacked the clichés that shape derogatory attitudes towards women at home, and said they should be treated as seriously as racism and sexism. The leading child development expert told a conference that the rise of prejudice had helped make it socially unacceptable to argue that children benefit from ‘full-time’ parenting. He added that evidence from biosciences showed that mothers provided ‘unrivalled benefits’ to young children that other people, including fathers, could not. Dr Sigman said: ‘You should take on “motherism” - the prejudice against stay-at-home mothers - a prejudice that expresses itself in derogatory clichés like: “You gain a baby and lose a brain” and comments that refer to “schoolgate mother mentality”, or to being “willingly self-lobotomised”. Concerns: Dr Aric Sigman attacked the clichés which shape derogatory attitudes towards women at home . ‘The implication is that by being a full-time mother you are “subjugated and servile” and even sexually unattractive once you are a mother - a quality only associated with women who return to work with their high heels and clipboards.’ He added: ‘Motherhood must not hide its light under a bushel. Greater maternal contact in the early years, especially during infancy, is greatly advantageous to the child. ‘Society must be asked why this could possibly be construed as contentious.’ The event was organised by the Mothers At Home Matter group, which has campaigned against taxpayer-funded child care support for parents who both work, reported The Sunday Telegraph. The group recently challenged the Chancellor George Osborne over his remark that being a full-time mother was a ‘lifestyle choice’. Recent figures show the majority of mothers now work, with many seeing full-time parenting as something confined to the rich or those on benefits. Experts disagree over whether having a mother go out to work impacts on a child’s development. Some studies show those who go to good nurseries or childminders can be better prepared for school and are able to communicate more efficiently. But Dr Sigman, a fellow of the Society of Biology and associate fellow of the British Psychological Society, has argued in the past that there may be long-term effects of sending toddlers to full-time day care. The academic, who has four children, said that the derogatory attitudes towards stay-at-home mothers appeared to be the result of a political and economic agenda. Sally Goddard Blythe, an expert in child development at the Institute for Neuro-Physiological Psychology, agreed. She said: ‘We are the only mammal that deliberately separates its young from its mother for economic and social reasons before it is physically able to fend for itself.’","Academic says 'motherism' is prejudice unspoken but highly damaging .

Form of expression: This gesture is commonly used by Silvio Berlusconi as a sign of disbelief . Waving your hands in the air is as undeniably Italian as buffalo mozzarella, bankruptcy and bunga bunga. But the well known tradition of gesturing is not just an expression of their extensive range of emotions – Italians use around 250 distinct hand signals in everyday conversation, experts have revealed. Gestures, most of which originated in Naples, generally include fingers flying horizontally from the chin, exaggerated shrugs and upheld palms, and lots of exasperated cries and raised eyebrows. Some are offensive – meaning ‘gay’ or ‘cuckold’. But many are mundane: ‘can I have a cigarette’, ‘call me’. Or ‘tastes good’, virtually all now internationally recognised gestures. Perhaps the best known is the one used regularly by Silvio Berlsuconi to express disbelief at the stupidity of what someone is saying. The hands are slightly cupped, with the finger tips forming upward-pointing cones which are shaken more or less violently, depending on the degree of exasperation. Very common in Naples, it translates as ‘What do you want?’ Professor of psychology at Roma Tre University and an expert on gestures, Isabella Poggi has identified 250 individual signs, that she says are akin to a language in their own right. The signs can have quite complex meanings, she told the NY Times; ‘There are gestures expressing a threat or a wish or desperation or shame or pride,’ she said. The sign for ‘I don’t give a ****’ is an act of defiance.: ‘It’s a rebellion against power, a way of reacquiring one’s own dignity.’ The only thing that separates hand gestures from sign language is that they are used individually, she said. Meaning: The range of signs can have quite complex meanings, from desperation to shame. Here, Berlusconi seems to be pinching his lips, telling someone to stop talking . Talking with hands: The only thing that separates hand gestures from sign language is that they are used individually . No one knows for certain why the system of gestures developed. One theory is that Italians developed them as an secret language of communication during centuries of foreign occupation — by Austria, France and Spain in the 14th through 19th centuries, Professor Poggi said. And in busy cities like Naples, gesturing was a way of marking one’s territory. ‘To get attention, people gestured and used their whole bodies,’ she added. Recognisable: Some of the signs are easy to decipher. Here, the Italian Minister for Integration Cecile Kyenge is raising her hand to stop someone mid-speech . Salute: Bank of Italy deputy governor Fabrizio Saccomanni gestures during a meeting. The hand movements developed from a time when people gestured with their whole bodies . Hand gesturing appears to be an ancient phenomenon. Gestures used by the figures painted on ancient Greek vases found in the Naples area can be easily compared to those used by today’s Neapolitans. Italian writer Italo Svevo wrote in a letter to his wife from England in 1901. ‘It seems that in this country, I’m actually a laughing stock on account of my way of gesturing... Hands in pockets - only then can you speak English.’","Gestures originated in Naples are now internationally recognised .

Caroline Seeds used to be so scared of heights she avoided going up tall buildings but now she is a trapeze artist . A woman who was afraid of heights has become a solo trapeze artist with a travelling circus. Caroline Seeds, from Sawtry in Cambridgeshire, used to avoid going up tall buildings and walking over high bridges. But now, the 27-year-old has conquered her fear by flying through the air nearly 20ft above ground in the big top of Billy Smart’s Circus. Miss Seeds, who originally joined the . circus as a dancer, now swings from the trapeze at least twice a day. 'I’ve always been scared of heights and avoided going anywhere high, unless I was strapped in,' she said. 'The first time I went up high on the trapeze I was a nervous wreck and very scared. I was shaking so much I fell off. 'But . I love performing so much I have managed to get over my fear of heights . and I’m often so caught up in what I am doing that I forget how high . above the ground I am.' Miss Seeds started dancing when she was 11 and attended as many classes as she could including ballet, tap, modern and jazz. After leaving school she did a Btec in . dance at Peterborough Regional College in Cambridgeshire, then joined a . cabaret show in Menorca for two seasons. When she returned she decided to join the circus after seeing a job to be a dancer advertised. 'I never planned to join the circus, but the opportunity came up, then I met a boy there and although we later broke up, I decided to stay,' she said. Miss Seeds decided to take on an actual act and her then boyfriend offered to teach her tricks on the trapeze. New heights: Caroline Seeds said she never planned to join the circus but saw a job as a dancer . The 27-year-old conquered her fear by flying through the air nearly 20ft above the ground . Caroline now swings from the trapeze which is as high as a house at least twice a day . 'I’d never been on a trapeze before and to start with we practised with it on the ground so for a while it didn’t cross my mind that I would be performing in the air,' she said. 'When it was hoisted into the air, I was so scared I fell off and didn’t try it again for a while.' But her confidence was boosted when she went to a circus in the Netherlands as a magician’s assistant and practised daily with a flying trapeze troop. She used a safety harness and suddenly the act didn’t seem quite so scary. 'It helped me get over my fear of heights and after that I decided to learn properly,' she added. Class act: Caroline poses outside the big top at Billy Smart's Circus in Cambridge . No fear: Caroline's act includes everything from swinging, balancing and even hanging on with her toes . 'Initially I was quite weak in my arms, so it took a while to build up the strength required to be able to do it. But now I love it. I feel very free when I’m flying through the air.' Miss Seeds' act includes everything from swinging, balancing and spinning to jumping off and catching the bar with her arms or legs and hanging on with her toes. She has fallen off several times, but says someone has always been there to catch her. The dancer has now got her own caravan at the circus based in Cambridge where Caroline performs . Caroline Seeds stands outside the booking office at Billy Smart Circus in Cambridge . She said: 'My mum is always worried and holds her breath until I’ve finished my act.

Security camera footage of soldiers appearing to loot goods during last month's Nairobi shopping mall siege has infuriated Kenyans who had initially praised troops for their courage in battling the Somali attackers. Gunmen from the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab group massacred at least 67 people when they raided the upmarket Westgate mall, hurling grenades and spraying bullets at shoppers as a punishment for Kenya sending troops to Somalia. Kenya's security forces have previously denied any wrongdoing. Looters: Footage shows Kenyan soldiers walking through the devastated mall carrying bags containing the goods they stole . Callous: The men appear totally oblivious to the blood stains on the mall floor where a victim was shot dead by a terrorist only hours before . Caught on camera: Kenya's security forces have previously denied any wrongdoing . Packed: A group of Kenyan soldiers walk past the store many carrying full white shopping bags . Soon after the attack began Kenyan officials put a security cordon around the mall, allowing only security forces and a few government personnel to pass through. When the attack was over, some who owned shops inside the mall complained of looting. Closed-circuit television footage obtained by Reuters shows soldiers taking goods that appear to be unpacked mobile phone boxes from a phone store while others are in a mobile money transfer shop. A couple of metres from the shop, a pool of spattered blood identifies the spot where a wounded man, crawling on the floor, was shot five times at point-blank range by an unidentified gunman, another scene captured on video.

The September 21 attack - the worst on Kenyan soil since al Qaeda bombed the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in 1998, killing more than 200 people - initially united Kenya's multi-ethnic community and sparked an outpouring of support for the military. But support for security services evaporated as shop owners returned to the mall to find their stores ransacked, with many reporting phones, expensive Swiss watches and designer suits stolen. Cash from tills was also missing, traders said. 'It was an injustice. These are people that we are looking up to for security and they let us down,' said Anne Njiru, a teacher. Public servants in Kenya - including police, firefighters and soldiers - are poorly paid and frequently accused of corruption. An investigation into a massive fire at Nairobi's airport in August revealed that first responders had looted electronics, a bank and an ATM during and after the blaze. Kenya's Interior Minister Ole Lenku also announced three bodies of 'terror suspects' had been recovered from the mall during the week and today the body of what was believed to be a fourth attacker was pulled from the rubble. Lenku said the government would not comment on the nationalities of the attackers until forensic investigations were complete. Four AK47 assault rifles and 11 magazines used by the gunmen were also recovered, he added in a statement.","Soldiers seen looting mall in Nairobi as the battle with militants raged .

Voters would rather see Ed Miliband in charge of the economy than Boris Johnson, a new poll reveals in a blow to the London Mayor’s political ambitions. Almost two thirds of people would not trust a Tory government led by Mr Johnson to take the right decisions to manage the economic recovery. The findings lay bare the challenge he would face in proving that the country’s best known political joker was also capable of taking tough decisions for the country. Challenge: Boris Johnson has been widely tipped as a future Prime Minister, but voters are not convinced the economy would be safe in his hands . The coalition is expected to be boosted by growth figures on Friday, which are expected to show the economy expanded by 0.7 per cent in the third quarter of 2013. Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne have been bolstered by the sense that the recovery is gaining momentum but warn that Britain is not out of the woods yet. Mr Johnson, long tipped as a future Tory leader, sought to present himself as a more serious political figure with a five-day visit to China. Talking up immigration and investment in London, he backed Mandarin lessons in British schools and urged the UK government to give the go ahead for a new airport in the south east. But attempts to sell Britain's relationship with China misfired with a Harry Potter analogy which lacked magic. The London Mayor was talking up how closer links with China, claiming it was like the wizard's first girlfriend 'Cho Chang - who is a Chinese overseas student at Hogwarts school'. However the boast quickly unravelled, with fans of the JK Rowling series pointing out that Cho Chang was British, and their relationship fell apart soon after starting. In a poll commissioned to mark the fifth anniversary of the news that the British economy plunged into recession, Mr Johnson has not emerged as its saviour. High flier: The London Mayor took a spectacular helicopter ride over Hong Kong as he arrived in the city as part of his trade mission to China last week . Fears: Almost two thirds of people fear Mr Johnson cannot be trusted with the economy . Just seven per cent of voters said they would trust Mr Johnson 'a great deal' with the economy and 20 per cent 'a fair amount', compared to 12 per cent and 23 per cent who backed a Tory government led by Mr Cameron. Just over half of people (58 per cent) said they would not trust Mr Cameron with the economy, compared to almost two thirds (62 per cent) who said the same of the London Mayor. It means Mr Cameron had a net score of -23 per cent, much better than -35 per cent for a Conservative government led by Mr Johnson. A Labour government led by Ed Miliband had a net rating of -32 per cent, also better than Mr Johnson. The next preferred option was a power-sharing deal between Mr Cameron's Tories and Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats. Coalition: Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) is more trusted on the economy than Mr Johnson, but voters would trust him less if he went into coalition with Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg . Voters were less impressed by a Lib-Con coalition with Vince Cable leading the Lib Dems, with only a net rating of -44 per cent. A Labour-Lib Dem coalition between Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg had a net trust rating of -53 per cent, the worst of all options put to the people polled. The YouGov poll was commissioned lobbying and media relations firm PLMR. Kevin Craig, managing director of PLMR, said: ‘On the 5th anniversary of the start recession we wanted to see who the British public trusts most to lead us into a recovery, and the results are not encouraging for any of the contenders. ‘There is a hint that local politicians seem to, “Get it” a little more than the national leadership contenders but clearly all politicians have work to do when it comes to inspiring confidence in their economic policies.’","New poll reveals people would rather trust Labour's Ed Miliband .

The Vatican's chief accountant has been ordered to remain in prison following his arrest over an alleged plot to smuggle 20 million euros from Switzerland to Italy. Monsignor Nunzio Scarano, was denied house arrest and will remain at Rome's Queen of Heaven prison until a decision is made as to whether to indict him. Scarano, the bishop of Salerno, was taken into custody last week along . with an Italian secret agent Mario Zito and broker Giovanni Carenzio. Arrest: Monsignor Nunzio Scarano, the bishop of Salerno, the chief accountant for the Vatican's vast property portfolio, has been taken into custody . Scarano, . 61, who worked at Deutsche bank before taking ecclesiastical vows, is . accused of fraud, corruption, and other charges, as part of a wider . investigation into the IOR Vatican Bank.] . His nickname in Vatican circles . was reportedly ‘Don 500 Euros’ thanks to his habit of showing people . that he had only the largest bank note in his wallet. Friends of his had allegedly asked him to negotiate with Carenzio to return 20 million euros they had given him to invest. After persuading Carenzio to return the money, he and Italian secret service agent Zito, allegedly went to Switzerland to smuggle the cash back aboard an Italian government aircraft. Scarano is also under investigation for alleged money-laundering . stemming from his account at the Vatican's bank, called the Institute . for Religious Works, or IOR. The investigation concerns transactions he made while an official at the Administration for the Patrimony of the . Apostolic See, in 2009. He reportedly took 560,000 euros ($729,000) in cash out of his personal IOR bank account and carried it out of the . Vatican and into Italy to help pay off a mortgage on his Salerno home. The Vatican bank, formerly known as the Institute for Religious Operas, IOR, inside the Vatican and Monsignor Nunzio Scarano, the chief accountant for the Vatican's property portfolio . It is the latest in a long series of financial scandals which have rocked the Vatican bank and embarrassed the papacy. Last week, Pope Francis named five . people to head a commission of inquiry into the bank, the Institute for . Religious Works, or IOR, to get to the root of the problems that have . plagued it for decades and mired the Vatican in scandal over the years. At the start of this week, the top two managers at the IOR resigned. Their boss, bank president Ernst von Freyberg, had just weeks earlier . praised Paolo Cipriani and Massimo Tulli as 'truly happy' and helpful . collaborators as the bank worked to comply with anti-money-laundering . norms. Von . Freyberg said it was clear that the bank needed new leadership 'to . increase the pace' of the IOR's transformation - a suggestion that the . two managers had in some way held back that transformation. And by the end of the week, von Freyberg was even more blunt in briefing the bank's board about the Scarano case. 'The . internal investigation that I have initiated has proven effective and . discovered clear failings,' von Freyberg told the board, according to . excerpts of his remarks obtained Friday by The Associated Press. 'That . should serve as a stark reminder of the urgency of improving (the) IOR's . processes.' He said the . bank was reviewing each of the IOR's 19,000 accounts 'and we will . systematically identify and eradicate wrongdoing of clients in our . institute.' The high profile arrests come just 48 hours after Pope Francis announced the line up for his commission into the Vatican Bank . One of those Italian investigations formally wrapped up on Friday as prosecutors prepare to request indictments: In 2010, Rome prosecutors placed Cipriani and the IOR's then-president, Ettore Gotti Tedeschi, under investigation for allegedly violating Italy's anti-money-laundering norms with a routine bank transaction involving an IOR account at an Italian bank. Police seized 23 million euros, though it was later ordered released. Italian news reports said prosecutors would exonerate Gotti Tedeschi, given he had nothing to do with the day-to-day functioning of the bank, but would likely seek indictments against Cipriani and Tulli, though the exact nature of the accusations against them remains unclear. The Pope has hired Swiss-born anti-money laundering expert Rene Bruelhart to lead the Holy See's push for greater financial transparency. Yesterday he was heading to Sun City, South Africa, for the annual meeting of the Egmont Group, a gathering of financial information agencies from 130 countries. Despite . the news of the resignations the Holy See won coveted membership in the Egmont Group this . week, joining a club that aims to share financial information in the . global fight against money laundering and terror financing. For . Bruelhart, dubbed the 'James Bond of the financial world' by some . media, joining Egmont means that the Vatican now is part of a trusted . 'family' and has more help in combating financial crimes - even if it . can't root them out entirely. 'With . this membership, we are a credible player in the international and . global fight against money laundering and terror finance,' Bruelhart . said in a telephone interview Thursday from Sun City. 'They trust us. That is very important.' The Egmont Group, which was created . in 1995, aims to smooth the exchange of information and improve . cooperation among its members. Those members are the financial . intelligence units of countries' central banks - the departments that . collect and investigate reports of suspicious financial transactions. Bruelhart . headed Liechtenstein's financial intelligence unit for eight years, and . led the Egmont Group for two before being tapped by the Vatican as a . consultant last year. The Holy See eventually named him director of its . own financial intelligence unit to oversee all its financial activities. Then-Pope Benedict XVI created the Financial Intelligence Authority, or . AIF, in 2010 as part of the Vatican's push to comply with international . norms to fight money laundering. The Pope has hired Swiss-born anti-money laundering expert Rene Bruelhart to lead the Holy See's push for greater financial transparency . The Vatican's newborn AIF was faulted on several fronts when it was evaluated last year by independent European inspectors, though a follow-up evaluation is scheduled for December. Bruelhart has said that amended laws and regulations are in the works ahead of the December progress report, and that for now the Holy See was content to have passed the milestone with Egmont. Asked how Egmont could have cleared the Holy See when there are still clearly problems at the bank, Bruelhart stressed the Egmont evaluation criteria was transparent and formal, with on-site visits and evaluations of its legislative framework and regulations. 'No country in the world is 100 percent perfect,' he said. 'What's important is if something is happening, you have the competent authority and you have the tools and measures to take relevant action.' The next step for Bruelhart is to ink . a bilateral agreement with Italy to share financial information - a . critical step given that the Italians have been the harshest critics of . the Vatican's murky financial dealings, convinced that people have used . the IOR to shield money from Italian tax authorities. As it is, Italian . prosecutors have various investigations under way targeting the Vatican . bank and people who may have used it for less than holy ends. 'We've identified the countries which are of relevance and important for us, and amongst them is Italy,' Bruelhart said.","Monsignor Nunzio Scarano, the bishop of Salerno, will remain in prison .

Today she was starting a 13 year sentence behind bars which included six years of drug offender probation. Miller claims she woke up one day to find the baby had died. She told the court she panicked and hid the baby’s body in a freezer behind her boyfriend’s house in Titusville, Florda. Paying tribute to little Ja’veon, who would have been three year old today, Assistant State Attorney Julia Lynch told FloridaToday.com: ‘He would have been talking, running, playing.

Robert Jones said that he was grabbed by the arm and that the assault lasted less than half an hour (stock image) A charity worker claims he was sexually abused by a female soap star when he was just 16. Robert Jones, now 48, claims the actress targeted him in her home when he was a vulnerable teenager and pulled him into her bedroom. The father-of-three, who waived his right to anonymity, says that he has come forward only now because he wants the woman to 'answer for what she did'. He told the Daily Mirror that he was grabbed by the arm and that the assault lasted less than half an hour when he was 16 in 1981. Mr Jones told the newspaper: 'I remember going to a small place within myself. 'I kept thinking ""Just get through it, it'll be over soon"". 'This is something that I've never really got over and has hung over me most of my life.' A Metropolitan Police spokesman said they were considering the allegations. They said: 'A man contacted police on 16 October to report an incident which allegedly took place in 1981. This report is being considered.' The allegation comes after a study showed a rise in reports of sexual offences; which was put partly down to greater numbers coming forward to report historical sexual offences to the police following the Savile inquiry. The Office of National Stastics said: ‘There is evidence to suggest that these increases are partly a result of the Operation Yewtree investigation, initiated in October 2012 and connected to the Jimmy Savile inquiry. A study showed a rise in reports of historical sexual offences to the police following the Savile inquiry . ‘Whilst some of these increases will be a direct consequence of the crimes reported as part of Operation Yewtree there is also evidence to suggest that there has been a wider “Yewtree effect”, whereby there is increased willingness on the part of the victims to come forward and report historical sexual offences that are not directly connected to Yewtree. ‘Additionally the publicity surrounding Operation Yewtree may have encouraged more victims to come forward and report more recent abuse cases.’ The scandal shows no sign of dying down, as BBC chiefs Lord Hall and Lord Patten will be grilled by MPs this week over an alleged ‘cover-up’ in the £3million inquiry into the Corporation’s failure to expose the Jimmy Savile scandal. The Mail on Sunday understands the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee will call up Lord Hall, the BBC’s director-general since April, and Lord Patten, BBC Trust chairman, on Tuesday. They will be asked about their refusal to investigate why key evidence about ex-BBC director-general Mark Thompson was excluded from the Pollard Review – the report into Newsnight’s axed expose of the disgraced DJ.

French officials last night confirmed they are not even searching for missing schoolgirl Megan Stammers – because her maths teacher Jeremy Forrest is not considered a ‘criminal suspect’. The authorities in France also said they will make no attempt to arrest the 30-year-old, even if he is found, because he has not broken any of the country’s laws, despite eloping with his 15-year-old pupil without her parents’ permission. The revelation will fuel fears too little is being done to find the pair – who left Britain last Thursday night after Sussex Police began investigating their relationship. Hunt: Teacher Jeremy Forrest and Megan Stammers were last . seen on CCTV getting on a ferry to France almost six days ago and have . vanished without a trace . Even the suggestion that French police . have been waiting for Forrest to use his bank or credit cards in order . to track his movements was rubbished. The lack of interest in France in the . runaway pair emerged as police in Britain faced searching questions . about their own response to reports of what would have been a . potentially criminal relationship. As Megan’s parents waited for information it emerged: . While the schoolgirl’s disappearance . has been making headlines across Britain, the coverage on the Continent . has been much more muted, hindering efforts to track the pair. New pictures: These images, released today, show how Megan is a fun-loving teenager, but she has also started an inappropriate relationship with her teacher - a man twice her age . First pictures: These stills taken from CCTV . camera footage filmed aboard a Dover to Calais ferry last Thursday show . 30-year-old teacher Jeremy Forrest with his arm round runaway schoolgirl . Megan Stammers in one picture and walking hand in hand with her in the . other . Distinctive: Forrest had this image of a young . girl wearing a hat and walking a dog (left) tattooed on his arm earlier . this year. He also has a floral display (right) on his other arm . The step-father of Megan Stammers had worked with the teacher she has fled to France with in 2010, it has been revealed. Martin Stammers, right, said today that he thought that Jeremy Forrest 'seemed a nice bloke'. The . teenager's mother and stepfather have said they were unaware of any . relationship, and Sussex Police was only made aware of it last week. Mr Stammers, 43, told The Sun that he worked with Forrest two years ago at The Causeway School in Eastbourne, where he teaches. 'I knew Forrest as a colleague. He worked at a twin school. 'He did some work for us about two years ago. He seemed a nice enough fellow - there was nothing out of the ordinary about him. 'But this is all about Megan and getting her back - then the police can deal with him.' The age of consent in France is 15, meaning any intimate relationship between them would not be deemed illegal. French prosecutor Jean-Philippe . Joubert said Megan was old enough to travel with Forrest voluntarily, . and unless the authorities received a criminal complaint from their . British counterparts, she would simply be treated as a ‘missing person’. Mr Joubert, the prosecutor of . Boulogne-sur-Mer and one of the most senior judicial figures in northern . France, said Forrest is not a criminal suspect so it would effectively . be illegal for police to arrest him. ‘The couple will only be stopped if . they are spotted during an identity check on the road, or if someone . recognises them from photos,’ he said. The use of CCTV footage is much less . common in France. Officials at Calais Port only began reviewing images . yesterday, almost a week after the pair entered the country. While some French media have shown a . picture of Megan, many refuse to do so because of a fear of falling foul . of privacy legislation, while others have had no hesitation in . describing the couple as ‘lovers’. Denial: The Bishop Bell Church of England school in Eastbourne claim they have robust procedures in place to protect their pupils . Missing since Thursday: Schoolgirl Megan Stammers, 15, fled to France with her 30-year-old maths teacher . Police in Britain are believed to have been in possession of Megan’s mobile phone before she ran away. The teenager’s friends also claimed that her mother had confiscated the phone in the days before she vanished. The revelations will fuel questions about how much was known about the girl’s relationship with Forrest. Megan was interviewed by officers a few days before she fled the country, according to one relative of the missing couple. And Forrest was due to be suspended from school last Friday, the day the alarm was raised over their disappearance. Poignant: Megan Stammers's mother Danielle .

Distraught: Megan Stammers' mother Danielle Wilson and step-father Martin Stammers can't hold back the tears as they speak to the media at Sussex Police Headquarters in Lewes . A friend claimed Megan’s mother, Danielle Wilson, confiscated her phone just days before she ran away. The 15-year-old friend, who spoke to . the Mail with her mother present, added that this was not the first time . Megan’s mother had taken the phone. She said that on August 29 she . received a message from Megan asking her not to text her as her mother . was due to take it away and would see her messages. The text from Megan read: ‘Hi, could you not text after this as my mum is taking my phone away. Hahahahaha.’ Married: Maths teacher Jeremy Forrest, 30, pictured with his wife Emily on their wedding day in Brighton . The revelations follow confusion surrounding Sussex Police’s response. In Britain, police have said that they . were only told about Megan’s relationship with Forrest last week, but . have declined to specify which day. They also first said that the pair . left Britain in a Ford Focus, but subsequently corrected this to say . they were in a black Ford Fiesta. It was also unclear if officers . initially realised that the couple had booked return ferry tickets from . France to come back on Sunday night.

Anne Diamond caused outrage yesterday after she flippantly dismissed the hunt for Megan Stammers as ‘a bit so whatish’. The former breakfast TV presenter said the age gap between the missing teenager, 15, and Forrest, 30, was ‘not sickeningly huge’. Her comments – made during Tuesday evening’s paper review on Sky News – prompted a wave of angry comments from viewers who said the 58-year-old was ‘out of touch’. Miss Diamond, who has four children, began by telling Sky News presenter Anna Jones: ‘Clearly, this is wrong. 'He shouldn’t have done it and he must be tracked down and he must be brought to book for it, but it’s just got everybody talking about relationships others had with their teachers. ‘She’s 15, he’s twenty-something.’ The presenter interrupted to correct Miss Diamond about Forrest’s age but undeterred she continued: ‘At any rate it’s not a sickeningly huge age gap.’ Ignoring the fact that Megan is still classed as a minor, she added: ‘I’m not making light of what is a crime here...but nevertheless, again I feel it’s a bit so whatish.’ Miss Diamond’s remarks sparked an almost immediate backlash among Twitter users. Jennifer de Santos wrote: ‘Anne Diamond just said “So what?” regarding Megan Stammers on Sky News. How utterly appalling and senseless.’ Lynn Ede wrote: ‘Cannot believe Anne Diamond on Sky News is saying can’t understand “big” press on runaway pupil with teacher! Have to say, presenter on Sky News also looked pretty shocked at Anne Diamond’s views...’ Richard Dixon wrote: ‘Bizarrely complacent attitude from Anne Diamond on Sky News re girl running off with teacher at school with poor safeguarding record.’ Search continues: Megan Stammers, 15, was last . seen on CCTV boarding a ferry to Calais on Thursday night in a car driven . by Forrest . Another user told Miss Diamond: ‘I cannot believe what I have just heard you say. Out of touch. That teacher is a disgrace to all in the profession.’ Paul Bradley added: ‘Anne Diamond on Sky papers. What a travesty. More clueless than she was in the 80s!’ Miss Diamond, who presents a radio show on BBC Berkshire, was unavailable for comment last night. A spokesman for Sky News said: ‘We do not necessarily condone or agree with comments made by our guests.’ Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator, said it had so far not received any complaints about Miss Diamond’s comments.

The man suspected of killing the 2-year-old biological son of NFL star Adrian Peterson apparently feels indignant enough to see himself as a secondary victim. Joey Patterson was the only other person in the Sioux Falls, South Dakota apartment when he called police to report that his girlfriend's son Tyrese was choking. Patterson has since been arrested and charged with aggravated battery and assault but the charges may be increased to murder since the toddler was taken off life support following the injuries sustained to his head.

Shocking: The spike missed Josh's heart by a mere two inches when he was impaled on the fence near his home in Essex . These shocking pictures show how a schoolboy cheated death after a metal fence spike pierced his chest - missing his heart by two-and-a-half inches. Josh Hassan, 12, was leaning over the railing near his home in Ilford, London, to look for his football when he lost his footing and became impaled on the fence. His horrified mother was helped by neighbours to support his body to stop the blade doing further damage as they waited for the emergency services to arrive and cut him free. Dawn Hassan told of her horror at discovering her son 'hanging' from the fence after being alerted by his screams. 'It took three of us to hold him up so the spike didn't . do any more damage,' she said. 'But Josh was so brave. He didn't cry once. He was a . right little soldier.' The mother-of-two, 30, said waiting for paramedics and firefighters to cut her son free from the fence 'felt like an eternity'. Josh was rushed to hospital with the blade still piercing his chest, and doctors later told the family the spike had missed his heart by less than three inches. A photograph of Josh's injury and an X-ray scan showing the enormous spike in his chest reveal the extent of his lucky escape. Pain: Josh Hassan had an agonising recover at his home in Chadwell Heath, Essex . Impaled: The spike from the gate that pierced Josh's chest . Scarred: Josh at home with his mother Dawn Hassan . The schoolboy had been playing . outside when he kicked his football over the spiked metal gate . around the corner from his house. Leaning over the fence to see how far . the ball had gone, Josh slipped and was speared by the steel shaft . which pierced his flesh. His mother said: 'He's the kind of child who's more worried about everybody else than what's happening to him. Dangerous: The gate where Josh was climbing when he fell onto the spike . Lucky to be alive: Joshua was taken to hospital with the spear from the fence still jutting through his chest - as seen in this X-ray image . 'Brave': Josh's mother raced outside to find her son impaled on the railings when she was alerted by the sound of him screaming . Terror: Josh's mother Dawn said waiting for firefighters and paramedics to free her son felt 'like an eternity' 'I can't thank the people who helped him enough. They're our heroes. If it wasn't for them Josh might not be here now. 'The doctors said the spike was only two and a half inches away from his heart,' she went on. 'I . still can't believe he climbed over the fence in the first place. He's . not a daring child. He was just seeing where his ball went. 'And for that to happen - he won't be climbing over any fences in the future,' she added. Josh was rushed to the Royal Free Hospital following the incident on Tuesday and immediately operated on by surgeons. Julie Spalding, 43, a mother-of-three . who lives close to where the accident happened, said her daughter . Amber, 13, who had also been playing outside when Josh was impaled on . the fence, dashed into the house calling for help. Close shave: Josh, 12, seen left where the spike was cut away from the railings while still attached to him, was held up by neighbours and his mother Dawn, right with her son, who was alerted by his screams . Spike: Josh is now recovering after an operation to remove the lengthy piece of metal railing from his chest . Pierced: The railing, topped by sharp metal spikes, where Josh became impaled outside his home . Freed: The gap in the railings where firefighters cut away the spike that had pierced Josh's chest . 'My son Chris rushed out,' she said. 'Josh was screaming. He was in so much pain. Support: Chris Spalding, 22, was among those to come to Josh's aid by supporting the weight of his body as he dangled from the fence . 'The spike on the top of the gate had gone in just under his left nipple and came out the same side. 'Chris held Josh to support him so he . didn’t fall down further onto the spike while we waited for the fire . brigade to get there,' Ms Spalding added. 'Josh’s parents Dawn and Darren came running down to the gate. 'They were absolutely beside themselves. It took ages to get him free. 'The firefighters had to cut the metal . railings and then Josh went to hospital with the spike still inside him. 'It was such a gruesome sight,' Ms Spalding said. 'The railing came so close to his heart and lungs, Josh is seriously lucky to be alive.' Neighbours say this is the second time a child has been impaled on the same fence. Two years ago a 14-year-old boy got . his arm caught on a spike, but because it is private housing nobody has . taken responsibility for it, they say. Ms . Hassan said: 'I'm disappointed nothing was done about it before but . even if it means I have to go out there with an angle grinder myself I . will. 'I couldn't live with myself if it happened to another child and what if its not a near miss next time.' Josh said he was 'doing fine' but is in a lot of pain, adding that it hurts to sneeze, cough or giggle. 'I've told my little brother Logan to stop making me laugh,' he said. He has decided to keep the spike which went through his chest as a souvenir.","Shocking images show spike piercing Ilford schoolboy Josh Hassan's chest .

The adoptive mother of a 10-year-old Californian boy who stabbed his 12-year-old best friend and killed him last year has broken her silence to claim that her son was suffering side-effects of an anti-deppressant prescribed to control an incorrectly diagnosed behavioral issue. His mother Julie, who is not using her surname to protect her son, has revealed that she has only now discovered that her boy's violent behavior stems from the fact that he suffers fetal alcohol syndrome - an extremely rare condition which affects only one-percent of the population. Speaking out now, Julie has said that she will campaign tirelessly to raise the public awareness of fetal alcohol syndrome which she says has caused her son a lifetime of physical and mental issues and is the real reason for his actions that day. Undiagnosed: The unidentified 10-year-old boy (left) who stabbed and killed his best friend Ryan Carter (right) who was 12-years-old in January 2012 in El Cajon, San Diego . Ryan Carter, 12, was fatally wounded on Martin Luther King Jr. Day last year in El Cajon by his 10-year-old best friend after a game of sword-fighting with foam sticks they were playing outside spiraled out of control. In an in-depth interview with the San Diego Union Tribune, Julie explained how her son's condition, which was caused by his birth-mother drinking excessively during her pregnancy, caused the otherwise 'sweet and very loving' boy huge behavioral problems. These began when he was eight-years-old and expressed themselves in aggressive fits during which he would break furniture around the house and kick out at doors on their car. Julie admitted she would have to watch her son around other children, 'because he would get upset and he would try to hit somebody, and I would try to intervene,' Julie said. 'I could hear him. He had a war cry.' Eager to control his anger, Julie said that about a month before the fatal attack, he was prescribed an antidepressant called Anaphranil, and his personality changed. 'He got much more aggressive. … He punched me in the face twice,' Julie said. 'He’d never done that before. He bit my arms and left big marks. So that’s when I started emailing the doctor, going, ‘This isn’t right. This is very wrong.’ Tragic: Ryan Carter was stabbed to death after a play fight went wrong at the home of his friend in January 2012 . On January 16th, 2012, at their home in El Cajon, Julie told the Union Tribune that her son was playing a mock battle with Nerf swords with Ryan, when another kid was left without a partner. This child complained to Julie, who called her son into to tell him to let the other kid play. People who suffer this rare disorder exhibit abnormal facial features, learning disabilities and behavioral problemsThe condition is caused by excessive drinking during a pregnancy There is no cure, however quick and early treatment — such as medication and therapy — can lead to a higher quality of life for the child . This caused her 10-year-old to lose his temper and he grabbed a steak-knife and ran outside with it, seemingly intent on using it. However, Julie managed to grab her son in the nick-of-time and brought him back inside. Suddenly, her child grabbed another knife from the kitchen and ran outside again, this time to be met by his best-friend Ryan, who often stayed over and who said wasn't going to let him past. Julie watched in horror as her boy stabbed Ryan and despite her best efforts as she administered CPR, Ryan later died in hospital. 'At the time, he had a heartbeat,' said Julie, who has emergency medical training. 'I had my thumb over the wound. It was just a little thumb-sized wound.' The case stunned the nation and her son became one of the youngest ever defendants charged with murder in San Diego County. He spent a year-and-a-half in Juvenile Hall and has only recently been released following the tragic incident. 'He was a great kid,' she said of her son's victim, adding that Ryan would spend the night at her house a couple of times a month. 'He had a big heart. He had a lot of patience.' Adopting her son as a five-month-old baby when she was 40, Julie, who is unmarried, said that when she first saw his picture from the adoption agency she noticed his 'small, wide-set eyes, thin upper lip and flat mid-face.' Indeed, Ryan's bereaved parents, Lisa and Glen Carter have incredibly, only offered sympathies to Julie, despite the death of their son . She told the San Diego Union Tribune that she remembered thinking: 'Wow, he’s kinda peculiar looking, but cute.' What she now knows is that his features were indicative of fetal alcohol syndrome. As he grew up he began to lag developmentally and showed obsessive traits - such as refusing to go anywhere without a security blanket and becoming frightened by public places with lots of people. Julie says he would only speak in one word sentences and began acting out in school by hiding under tables. But Julie never gave up on him. 'He’s my child,' she said she would tell herself. 'Even now, that’s not an option. He’s my son.' It was only after the stabbing that an attorney put Julie and her son in touch with Dr. Kenneth Lyon Jones, the man who originally identified fetal alcohol syndrome with Dr. David W. Smith in 1973. In Juvenile Hall, he diagnosed the boy with the condition which affects only one percent of the U.S. population. Dr. Edward Riley, a San Diego State University professor who studies alcohol-related birth defects, added that children exposed to alcohol in the womb tend to have smaller brains and trouble with communication and social interaction. Stabbed during a game: This is the home of Julie and her 10-year-old son who killed his friend Ryan Carter in January 2012 after a friendly game spiraled out of control . 'This is a brain-based disorder and we need to think about it in those terms,' Riley said. Tragically, Julie revealed that despite her son being labeled a 'problem child', one of his only friends was Ryan Carter. Indeed, Ryan's bereaved parents, Lisa and Glen Carter have incredibly, only offered sympathies to Julie, despite the death of their son. After the District Attorney’s Office charged the 10-year-old with murder and assault with a deadly weapon, it was announced he would receive psychiatric care in a place where he would have regular access to his mother. 'He doesn’t understand why he can’t come home, but he has difficulty controlling his anger and he does need to be there,' Julie said. 'If you took this all away, he would still need to be there.' This pleased Lisa. 'We’re thankful that he will get help,' Lisa Carter said at the time. 'The only way this tragedy could be made worse is if (Julie) were going through what we’re going through.' She said she hoped the boy would someday lead a normal life. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with them,' added Glen. Since the January stabbing on her own door-step, Julie has become vice president of the local chapter of the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.","Unidentified 10-year-old boy in El Cajon, California stabbed Ryan Carter, his 12-year-old friend to death after a bad tempered game last year .

Foreigners and immigrants who fail a residency test are to be barred from receiving legal aid for civil court cases. The ban would include claims made under human rights and health and safety laws which, according to a report published yesterday, threaten to undermine British military operations. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling told the Daily Mail he had decided to press ahead with a ban on non-Britons using public money to pay for civil claims. It will take effect early next year. Legal aid: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling decided to push ahead with the ban . The decision is the latest in a series of Government measures designed to stop Britain being seen as a  ‘soft touch’. Migrants will not be able to obtain the funding until they have lived legally in Britain for at least a year. The Government aims to cut the £1.7billion legal aid bill by around £300million. The report, by the Policy Exchange think tank, warned of a rise in claims against the government. Author Tom Tugendhat, a former assistant to the Chief of the Defence Staff, said human rights claims in the past decade have ‘undone safeguards Parliament drew up to ensure military commanders have the  freedom … to make vital decisions on the ground’. The report highlights cases in which foreign detainees argued  their human rights were breached because they were shouted at during interrogation. Such claims would not be funded by legal aid under the new ban. The Justice Secretary said: ‘I am very firmly of the belief that, in principle, individuals should have a strong connection to the UK in order to benefit from the civil legal aid scheme.’ Belief: Chris Grayling said he thought people should have a 'strong connection to the UK' to benefit from the scheme .","Foreigners and immigrants who fail a residency test are to be barred from receiving civil legal aid .

A mosquito species that can transmit both yellow fever and the dengue virus has been spotted in California. The species, known as the aedes aegypti, is known for its dark color with white markings around its legs, Medical Daily reports. It adds that unlike other mosquitoes, it prefers to bite people during all hours of the day, as opposed to only at night. The mosquitoes are extremely difficult to contain because they need as little as a teaspoon of water to lay their eggs, the website adds. The aedes aegypti mosquito, seen here in this file photo, can carry yellow fever and the dengue virus...and has been spotted in California . The insects' impact would be enormous for California residents, Tim Phillips of the Fresno Mosquito and Vector Control District told the Associated Press. 'If it gets away it will change the way we live in California. You may not be able to sit on your patio and enjoy a cup of coffee during the day without getting bit,' he said. The Associated Press adds that so far none of the mosquitoes trapped and examined in Clovis, California have carried diseases. Officials are concerned, however, that if they bite someone infected, there could be an outbreak. California officials are concerned about the potential spread of aedes aegypti mosquitoes, like the one seen in this file photo. Florida has battled an outbreak earlier this year . There have been approximately 200 cases of dengue fever since 2010, the Associated Press continues. Health officials think this outbreak of mosquitoes could have originated from eggs on containers imported into the country. The Las Vegas Guardian Express reports the California is a prime target for the mosquitoes' attack, since they die in cold weather. In September NPR reported that health officials in Florida were trying to control a dengue fever outbreak spread by the mosquitoes. Until 2009 when there was a Key West outbreak, dengue fever hadn't been seen in Florida for over 70 years. Dengue fever symptoms, The San Francisco Chronicle writes, include including high temperature, headaches and intense pain in muscles, joints and bones. Severe cases can lead to capillaries leaking, with patients dying from circulatory failure. Symptoms for yellow fever, the Chronicle says, include fever, headaches, and body aches. More severe symptoms may develop, including bleeding and death. While there is no specific treatment for yellow fever, there is a vaccine. Countries in other parts of the world, like the Paraguay patients seen here, frequently combat dengue, which is spread by the mosquitoes .","Aedes aegypti species will bite all hours of the day, need only TEASPOON of water to lay eggs .

An accident that resulted in the tragic deaths of two Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) workers is being investigated by the National Transport Safety Bureau (NTSB). Union officials have named the two deceased as Chris Sheppard, a BART worker and member of the AFSCME union and Larry Daniels who was a contract worker, according to ABC. The two men were killed when a train on a routine maintenance run hit them as they performed track inspection. Sad day: Christopher Sheppard (pictured) of Hayward and Larry Daniels were killed by a train just north of the Walnut Creek station on Saturday . The . accident in the East Bay city of Walnut Creek occurred shortly before . 2pm on Saturday as the train was on a routine maintenance operated by non-union . staff members, Bay Area Rapid Transit officials said in a statement. BART . officials said an 'experienced operator' was at the controls, but did . not specify who it was. The train was being run in automatic mode under . computer control at the time of the accident, the statement said. The NTSB held a media briefing Sunday about the ongoing investigation into the deaths. 'My concern coming out here, as it is with every investigation, is to find out what happened, gather the facts,' said NTSB Investigator-in-Charge Jim Southworth. 'And on scene, that's all we'll do is gather the facts. We'll make the measurements, we'll open every door, we'll spread out the expertise that we'll get from the parties, and we'll look at very single part of what went on out here and make a determination as to what happened.' On Friday, BART employees went on strike for the second time in four months over union demands for shorter workdays and overtime pay. According to the Los Angeles Times, the two unions representing BART workers had warned of the safety risks if managers were allowed to operated the trains during work stoppages. 'The managers may very well have been train operators at one time, but still it's a bit of a struggle to come up to speed on short notice,' Des Patten, a spokesman for Service Employees International Union Local 1021, said in a phone interview. Tragedy: A BART police officer looks along the BART tracks along Jones Road in Walnut Creek, where a moving BART train struck and killed two people . One of the BART workers who was killed was a member of the AFSCME union who had crossed the picket line to return to work. Investigators have not said who was at the controls of the train when the deadly incident occurred. They will be examining video recordings from inside the trains to see who was in the cabin at the time of the accident. They'll also be looking into the training and safety records of individuals operating that train. Inside Bay Area published the radio transmission that was made moments after the accident. The . train operator said: 'BART emergency! BART emergency to Central! We . just struck some individuals [at a track location] ... Central be . advised it may be BART employees.' Later, he said: 'Both are deceased and definitely BART employees.' Grim work: A BART officer both covers the body of one of the men struck and killed by the train and then inspects the outside of the train car . According . to a statement from BART, the two workers were performing track . inspections and both had 'extensive' experience working around trains. The inspection procedure requires that one person inspect the track and the other act as a lookout for oncoming trains. It is unclear if the two BART workers were following this procedure. BART . said the train was being run by an 'experienced' operator who was shuttling graffiti-covered cars to be cleaned. It was in . automatic mode and under computer control at the time of the accident. The bodies of the two deceased were spaced about 160 feet apart from each other on the tracks.

Almost 6 million young people are neither in school nor working, according to a study released Monday. That's almost 15 per cent of those aged 16 to 24 who have neither desk nor job, according to The Opportunity Nation coalition, which wrote the report. Other studies have shown that idle young adults are missing out on a window to build skills they will need later in life or use the knowledge they acquired in college. Without those experiences, they are less likely to command higher salaries and more likely to be an economic drain on their communities. Big problem: Almost 6 million young people are neither in school nor working, according to a study released Monday by The Opportunity Nation coalition . 'This is not a group that we can write off. They just need a chance,' said Mark Edwards, executive director of the coalition of businesses, advocacy groups, policy wonks and nonprofit organizations dedicated to increasing economic mobility. 'The tendency is to see them as lost souls and see them as unsavable. They are not.' But changing the dynamic is not going to be easy. The coalition also finds that 49 states have seen an increase in the number of families living in poverty and 45 states have seen household median incomes fall in the last year. The dour report underscores the challenges young adults face now and foretell challenges they are likely to face as they get older. A young person's community is often closely tied to his or her success. 'They just need a chance,' says Mark Edwards, executive director of the coalition of businesses, advocacy groups, policy wonks and nonprofit organizations dedicated to increasing economic mobility . The Opportunity Nation report tracked 16 factors - Internet access, college graduation rates, income inequality and public safety among them - and identified states that were doing well for its young people. Topping the list of supportive states are Vermont, Minnesota and North Dakota. At the bottom? Nevada, Mississippi and New Mexico. Community's fault: Charlie Mangiardi, who works with Year Up, a nonprofit that trains young adults for careers and helps them find jobs, says their destiny is 'too often determined by their ZIP code' 'Their destiny is too often determined by their ZIP code,' said Charlie Mangiardi, who works with Year Up, a nonprofit that trains young adults for careers and helps them find jobs. 'We have the supply. We don't have a lack of young people who need this opportunity,' Mangiardi added. Just look at some of the nation's largest cities. Chicago, Houston, Dallas, Miami, Philadelphia, New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Riverside, California, all have more than 100,000 idle youth, the Opportunity Nation report found. 'Often times they lack the social capital in life,' Mangiardi said. 'There's a whole pool of talent that is motivated, loyal and hardworking.' They just can't get through an employer's door, he added. That's why Year Up spends a year working with high school graduates to teach them career skills such as computer programming or equipment repair they can use when the program ends. It also includes life coaching so they can learn skills such as time management. More than 4,500 young adults from urban areas have completed the program and 84 per cent of them have found work. Nothing to do: Some of the nation's largest cities. Chicago, Houston, Dallas, Miami, Philadelphia, New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Riverside, California, all have more than 100,000 idle youth . Across the country: 49 states have seen an increase in the number of families living in poverty and 45 states have seen household median incomes fall in the last year . But it's a far tougher time for other young people. In Mississippi and West Virginia, 1 in 5 young people are idle - higher than their older neighbors. Mississippi has an overall unemployment rate of 8 per cent, while West Virginia posts about 7 per cent. Like most states, they saw their unemployment rate fall since 2011, but researchers caution that shift could come from fewer residents looking for work and from more who had simply given up their search for jobs. Way forward: Rob Denson, president of Des Moines Area Community College in Iowa, has helped rally community organizations in his city to develop a pilot program to help students as young as 14 find summer work . And it's not as though the challenges emerge from nowhere. Quality early childhood programs help students from poor families overcome societal hurdles, and on-time high school graduation rates often follow quality schools - other factors Opportunity Nation examined in its report. 'A lot of times we don't want to look at data because we don't want to be depressed,' said Rob Denson, president of Des Moines Area Community College in Iowa. But it's an uncomfortable reality that needs to be addressed, he said. Using previous years' reports from Opportunity Nation, Denson helped rally community organizations in his city to develop a pilot program to help students as young as 14 find summer work. Starting next summer, Des Moines students will be placed in paying jobs, part of a citywide collaboration to help its urban communities. It will help older adults, as well, because crime rates are expected to fall, he said. 'If they're not in school or at work, they're not usually doing something positive.'","15 per cent of those aged 16 to 24 who have neither desk nor job, according to report by the The Opportunity Nation coalition .

A key witness in the case of the father gunned down with his wife and mother-in-law has claimed he saw a 4x4 vehicle with UK number plates heading towards the crime scene around the time of the killings. The anonymous French forestry worker also said he saw a man on a motorbike in the lay-by near Lake Annecy where Saad al-Hilli, 50, his 47-year-old dentist wife Ikbal, and her elderly mother Suhaila al-Allaf were killed last September. Iraqi-born Mr al-Hilli's eldest daughter Zainab was shot, beaten and left for dead - but survived. Her four-year-old sister Zeena lay hidden under her mother's corpse and was only discovered eight hours after the murders. In a BBC Panorama documentary to be aired this evening, the local man explains that he passed the parking area as he went down a quiet mountain road just minutes before the shooting. He says that the motorbike was white and black, with panniers on either side, and the rider - who investigators have suggested may have been the shooter - was dressed in black from head to toe. Minutes later he passed another vehicle going up the mountain, while colleagues told him they saw the motorbike further up the road and spoke with the rider, describing him as a man with 'a bit of a beard'. 'The car was a BMW 4x4, X5, grey metallic, in good condition, clean, it looked pretty new,' the forestry worker said.

Investigators have repeatedly stated . that they believe Sylvain Mollier was in the wrong place at the wrong time . when he was shot dead on September 5, 2012. But this month a close friend of the late Mr Mollier told the local Essor newspaper in Annecy: ‘One day he told me that he had to be careful when he walked down the street, that he feared he would be shot.’ Mr . al-Hilli, a father of one who works as a payroll manager and lives in . Chessington, south-west London, said he was willing to take a lie-detector test to prove his innocence. Following the killings, speculation was rife about a dispute between the al-Hilli brothers over their inheritance. Zaid, a widower, has admitted there were tensions over the £825,000 home in Claygate, Surrey, where the satellite engineer and his family lived. The older brother was left his mother's 50 per cent stake in the property after she died from a heart attack in 2003 and claims Saad began demanding that share of the property in 2011. After his brother allegedly pinned him to a bed, the two did not speak again except through lawyers.

Mahmoud Yousef Hindi, a former doctor from Louisville, Kentucky, was found hanged in his police cell on Saturday afternoon while awaiting trail for the murder of two neighbours . A man awaiting trial for the alleged murder of two of his neighbours has hung himself in his cell. Mahmoud Yousef Hindi, a former doctor educated in Jordan, was being held at Louisville Metro Department of Corrections in Kentucky when he committed suicide by hanging himself. Centre director Mark Bolton said Hindi was not on suicide watch, and was seen praying 10 minutes before his body was found at 3.55pm on Saturday. He added that workers had performed CPR before taking Hindi to a medical centre, but he was pronounced dead around an hour later. In September last year Hindi allegedly shot two of his neighbours dead a homeowners' meeting inside Springdale Community Church. Association president David Merritt, 73, and member Marvin Fisher, 69, were thought to have been targeted because of a long-running dispute over a driveway and fence they claimed Hindi had built without proper planning permission. Around 20 people were inside the church when the killings took place, including a bible group, though nobody else was hurt. The housing association had taken Hindi to court multiple times and Hindi became so frustrated he wrote a note threatening to shoot any trespassers on his property, before taking a loaded gun to the meeting. Hindi's driveway (pictured) had caused a long-running dispute with the housing association which had lead to Hindi threatening to shoot any trespassers . The association said the driveway and this fence did not confirm to regulations in one of Kentucky's most exclusive communities and had threatened to take Hindi to court . In the letter, Hindi cites the Quran, the theory of creationism, the idea that America has gone to Communism and accused neighbors of stealing his 'no trespassing signs' in the dispute over the fence. Hindi, who one prosecutor labelled 'the epitome of danger to the community', also wrote that he tried to make peace with the neighbors, but became frustrated. In a videotaped interview with police, Hindi said he went to the meeting hoping to resolve the issues with Merritt and Fisher. 'I was hoping that I could reason with them,' Hindi told police. 'But I said to myself, if they are not going to resolve peace(fully) with me, honestly, I had to kill them. So I took my gun.' There were around 20 people in the Springdale Community Church when Hindi opened fire, including a bible group, but only two members of the housing association were shot . A July 2014 trial date had been set for Hindi, who could have faced the death penalty. He also faced seven charges of wanton endangerment. Hindi continued his erratic behaviour while in jail. He was hospitalized in March after a fight with officers. On New Year's Day he was accused of throwing water on an officer and threatening to kill him, leading to two more charges against him.","Mahmoud Yousef Hindi was awaiting trail accused of two murders .

This is the latest in a series of works by British graffiti artist Banksy to be put up in New York as part of his 'residency' Better Out Than In . British graffiti artist Banksy's new work was nearly defaced within hours of being discovered in New York on Sunday. The painting, which shows the silhouette of a child swinging a sledge hammer at a fire hydrant, appeared on the Upper West Side. Rival graffiti artists, angered by a new presence on their 'turf', have raced to destroy the works, leading to some residents putting up metal shutters and plexiglass to protect them. Several masked men tried to scrawl over the new work, but were apparently stopped by onlookers. While hundreds of street art enthusiasts have welcomed the Bristol-born tagger to their city, Mayor Michael Bloomberg has said he does not consider the work art and the illegal activity 'should not be permitted'. The work is Banksy's 20th in the city, as he puts up one a day for his show entitled Better Out Than In. Vandals have so far removed the doors and wheels from a car painted by Banksy, while other works have been painted over and pieces chipped from walls which have been 'tagged'. One rival was even unmasked and tackled by a security guard on camera after defacing a painting, though he escaped before police got there. As well as his traditional graffiti, during his stay in the city Banksy has also set up a street stall in central Park selling original signed works for $60 each, despite being worth an estimated $30,000. Scroll down for videos . While lovers of Banksy flocked to take pictures with the new painting, others reportedly tried to deface it just hours after it was found . Only three shoppers bought eight canvasses between them, with others apparently unconvinced that the stencils were real. His other works have included two paintings hung in an underpass in Chelsea, a car and wall painting depicting horses hunting men, and spray-painting the words 'the musical' after other slogans painted on walls. Two trucks were also used as moving works of art, one featuring a 'living painting' set up inside which drove around the city, and another slaughterhouse van which had toy animal heads stuck out from between the slats. It is the 20th artwork to be unveiled in the city as part of a month-long exhibition which has seen a new one appear every day . The 'art' has sharply divided opinions, with some property owners putting up shutters and screens to protect the works scrawled in their buildings, while Mayor Micheal Bloomburg said the activity 'should not be permitted' Several attempts have been made to unmask the as-yet unidentified artist during his stay across the pond, with one determined follower attaching a tracking device to the slaughterhouse van, though a note on Banksy's website later revealed 'you're now following a car service in Queens' after the device was moved. Another Twitter user posed pictures of three men packing away one of the vans in a Red Hook cap park, saying he had found Banksy because one of the men spoke with a British accent. Since rising to fame during the early 2000s Banksy's work has appeared all over the world, from Paris to Palestine, and he has even made a film called Exit Through The Gift Shop. Other art shows have attracted thousands of viewers including his first American show in LA in 2006, entitled The Elephant In The Room, which featured an actual painted elephant and attracted the likes of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.","Hammer Boy was discovered on Upper West Side on Sunday .

Sales of traditional British apples are being pipped to the post by a crisp, sweet interloper from the other side of the world. As homegrown favourites such as Cox’s Orange Pippin and Granny Smith decline in popularity,  shoppers cannot get enough of Jazz apples from New Zealand, whose sales are growing faster than any other variety. Demand for the Jazz, which was first grown commercially in 2004, has risen 89 per cent in four years, from 5,449 tons in 2009 to 10,320 in the past 12 months. Sales: Demand for the Jazz has risen 89 per cent in four years, while sales of traditional favourites have fallen . In contrast, sales of Cox’s Orange Pippin, which was created in Buckinghamshire in 1825, have fallen by more than 30 per cent in four years, from 43,420 tons to 30,031. The fall of the Granny Smith has been even greater, with sales down 40 per cent since 2009, falling 24,500 tons to 35,069. In fact, the Jazz – a cross between the biggest sellers, the Royal Gala and the Braeburn – is becoming such a fruitbowl favourite that it is grown in orchards across Britain. The Cox’s demise will be hard for traditionalists to swallow. The sweet-smelling, juicy, orange-red apples have been enjoyed for generations, but they are difficult to grow and susceptible to disease, which makes them less profitable than modern varieties. The New Zealand growers behind the Jazz carefully control who is allowed to grow the trees. In Britain, the growing licence is held by Worldwide Fruit, which began the world’s largest single apple plantation programme in this country in 2006. Fall: The rise of the Jazz comes despite the fact that apple consumption in Britain has fallen for the first time in four years (file picture) The £5million project means there are now 21 British Jazz growers. Some 340,000 trees have been planted, with another 275,000 to follow by 2018. The rise of the Jazz comes despite the fact that apple consumption in Britain has fallen for the first time in four years, following a 15 per cent rise in prices.

A shocking study has revealed that nearly one in three children in Britain have contemplated suicide by the age of 16. Stress over exams, fear of failure and concern about body image are just some of the pressures harming teenagers' mental health, the major survey discovered. The worrying findings by MindFull.org - a new website launched today which aims helping youngsters find counselling - has led to growing calls for teens to be given mental health lessons in school. The report, called Alone with my thoughts, based on the experiences of more than 2,000 16- to 25-year-olds across Britain, said: 'We are at risk of failing a generation . of young people'. Pressure: Fear of failure, the burden of exams and worries over body image are thought to be major reasons for large numbers of teens sinking into depression. (File photo) It added that a 'transformation in the way we address young . people’s mental health' was needed. It also recommended . mental-health lessons be included as part of the national curriculum, with counselling in . schools, and improved services which address the needs of children and . are focused on 'early intervention'. Research showed that 32 per cent of young Britons have had suicidal thoughts, while a similar proportion (29 per cent) of young adults deliberately harmed themselves as teenagers. And more than one in 10 (12 per cent) felt a failure almost every day when they were under 16. Issues around anxiety, stress and . body image lead to poor emotional wellbeing, leaving children less able . to cope. Unchecked, this can spiral into acute, long-term mental . illness, says the report . And the problem was compounded as a taboo surrounding discussing mental health issues prevented many teenagers seeking help, the report found. It called for more services to be provided to prevent a generation falling victim to suicide and self-harm. Fears: Taboo surrounding mental health is stopping teens from seeking help, the MindFull study found. (File photo) Founder and chief executive of MindFull Emma-Jane Cross said too many children are 'being let down or simply ignored,' 'It’s . unacceptable that so many are having to resort to harming themselves on . purpose in order to cope, or worse still are thinking about ending . their own lives.' And Lucie Russell, director of policy, . YoungMinds, said: 'These shocking statistics highlight what YoungMinds . has been saying for many years – that... young people’s mental health is . a vital issue that must be prioritised.' MindFull, an offshoot of the . BeatBullying charity, is backed by clinical psychologist Professor Tanya . Byron, Labour leader Ed Miliband, and child-protection expert Professor . Eileen Munroe. It will work with schools to educate . young people on how to cope with mental-health issues, and has created a . website to give free, confidential counselling for 11- to 17-year-olds. Of the 850,000 young people with a diagnosable mental-health problem, almost 75 per cent get no treatment, says the report. And for those who do, cuts to mental-health services often mean they don’t receive the long-term, intensive treatment they need. Mental . health should be given the same importance as physical health, . according to Professor Byron. Welcoming the new mindfull.org website, . she said: 'Teenagers naturally look to the internet as a source of . information and advice, so that’s where we need to be in order to help . the hundreds of thousands of young people who are getting no support.' And . Barbara Rayment, chair of the Children & Young People’s Mental .

The shocking picture comes from a video revealing the devastating effects man’s rubbish is having on wildlife. In the footage, seals and sea lions are seen with fishing lures hanging from their mouths or their necks bound by rubber bands and the plastic packing bands usually used to secure boxes. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A sub-adult male with a packing band around his neck . In a second image, the swelling and damage caused by one of these bands around a sea lion’s neck is painfully visible.

Shoppers are . also being urged to cut up plastic loops or rings from packaging before . they throw them into the bin. A study of eastern Steller sea lions, . which are in danger of extinction, was carried out between 2000 and . 2007 along the coast of Alaska and northern British Columbia. Researchers found that at least 386 animals had become entangled in or had swallowed debris. Plastic packing bands and  rubber bands were the most  common items found around their necks. Metal flasher lures, which  are used when fishing for salmon, were the most likely to be ingested. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game released the video to highlight the effect discarded fishing gear like this plastic band and other debris is having on marine animals . But the researchers said they could . have missed out some animals because they didn’t come to the shore or . were not visible among large  crowds of sea lions. Wildlife biologist Lauri Jemison . said: ‘We are certainly underestimating the number of animals entangled. We go out every summer here in southeastern Alaska and we try to visit . every haul out [where animals come to shore] and rookery [where they . breed] at least once.’ Sea debris can also be . life-threatening for other marine wildlife, including sea birds and . turtles. As well as the Steller sea lions, northern fur seals are also . badly affected. Although the researchers found that . they don’t swallow as much fishing gear as the Steller sea lions, they . are likely to get the plastic bands trapped around their necks. The Alaska Department of Fish and . Game is now looking for funding to work with the fishing industry to . help prevent sea lions and seals from becoming trapped in fishing . equipment. Sadly, any positive action has come too late for the sea lion trapped in the windsock.

This is the moment two lazy binmen were caught on camera filling a bin so they did not have to empty it. The men rearranged the refuse inside the large wheeled container to ensure the lid was jammed open, even picking up rubbish from the ground and piling it on top. They then took a photograph of their handiwork as ‘proof’ that the bin was too full for collection, and strolled off. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Utterly ridiculous': Mr Ahmed said he could not believe the footage of the binmen stuffing extra cardboard boxes into the wheelie bin . But the work-dodging pair were not as clever as they thought – their antics had been caught on CCTV footage. Now Cambridge council, which employs them, has issued a humiliating apology for the ‘inexcusably poor service’, and has promised to discipline the men after an investigation. But the shopkeeper who fell victim to the scam – and was left with the jam-packed bin after it should have been taken away – said the ‘moronic and inexcusable’ duo may have pulled the same stunt on countless other taxpayers. The CCTV footage shows the two men arriving at the back of the Dars Express convenience store in the city. Caught on camera: The workers had no idea they were being filmed as they put extra cardboard into the bin . One of the pair finds the large . wheelie bin comfortably full, with the lid propped only slightly open. He immediately begins ‘plumping up’ the rubbish inside to make it appear . more full, and pulls a flattened cardboard box partly out, to jam the . lid wide open. His colleague then joins in, taking . out a camera as he prepares to get the photographic evidence to justify . them leaving the bin behind. Several more cardboard boxes from the . ground are stuffed casually inside the bin, before a black bin bag is . picked up off the ground and placed on top, as the grubby icing on their . cake of lies. Only then is the photograph taken, . and the pair stroll off. Their whole deceitful operation has taken a . minute, which could have been spent emptying the bin. Red-handed: The pair are seen 'puffin up' the rubbish so the bin looks even more overfilled . The first that shop owner Iftkhar . Ahmed knew of the affair was when he found his bin – which he shares . with the neighbouring Seven Days Chinese restaurant – still full. He called the council for an . explanation, but was promptly told the authority had photographic . evidence the bin had been overloaded. Mr Ahmed said: ‘We checked our .

These actions are moronic and inexcusable.’ Mr Ahmed added: ‘In the footage it is . apparent that the bin was filled sufficiently and set to be emptied. But the bin collectors chose to be indolent and deceitful. Not happy: Mr Ahmed described the binmen's behaviour as 'moronic' ‘Not only did they refuse their duty . but added to the waste, filling it past the maximum capacity where the . bin could no longer close and put a bin bag on top of the bin lid. Their . purpose was clear in making it appear as though we had over-filled the . bin. ‘Not having suitable waste facilities . has created an unsafe and unhygienic environment for our customers and . employees.

Two friends from New Hampshire are lucky to be alive today after their boat capsized off the Massachusetts coast, leaving them to fend for themselves in the chilly water for 15 hours until they were rescued by a passing fishing vessel. The New Hampshire men spent Friday night sitting on a plank over two hulls of 25-foot trimaran as waves left them soaked and cold. George Reynolds said he and Fred Schaeffer recited Scripture verses and prayed for strength — and calm seas and wind — as their muscles cramped and they violently shivered as they tried to stay warm. Scroll down for video . Lucky survivors: Fred Schaeffer, left, and George Reynolds, right, sit in a car after being rescued in waters off of Salem, Massachusetts, where they had spent 15 hours following a capsizing . ‘It was a real test of my faith,’ Reynolds, of Derry, said from his home. ‘I said, “Lord, whatever your will is, I'm in the mercy of your hands, and if this is going to be the end, I'm trusting in your mercy.”’ Reynolds, 62, and Schaeffer, of Raymond, who's in his late 40s, put Reynolds' boat, the Ark Angel, in the water in Salem, Massachusetts, on Friday with plans to sail to Boston. But with winds blowing hard and the boat flying along at more than 25 knots, they decided part-way through the trip that it would be safer to turn back toward Salem. A strong gust of wind flipped the boat between 4 and 4.30pm a couple of miles from the mainland and more than a mile from the nearest island. Schaeffer's cell phone would not work once it got wet. Stranded: The men spent Friday night sitting on a plank over two hulls of a 25-foot trimaran called Ark Angel (pictured right) as waves crashed over them . The fishing boat that came to the stranded friends' help called the U.S. Coast Guard for assistance . Reynolds took off his life vest and tried waving it to get the attention of a faraway fishing boat, but the wind blew it out of his hands into the water. So he and his best friend put a plank across the hull and hunkered down, back-to-back to give each other warmth and support. Through the night, with the air temperature dropping into the 40s and water temperatures at 58 degrees, the water lapped onto their plank and on occasion crashed over them. Saturday morning's sunrise was a welcome sight. ‘When the sun rose, that was the most beautiful sunrise I've ever seen,’ Reynolds said. Lifesavers: Eddie Pereira (far left), who was captain of the rescue boat that scooped up the two men, said they were very cold and filled with gratitude . Sometime after 7am, they got the attention of a passing fishing boat named Fishy Business, which rescued them and brought them to shore in Salem. ‘They were very cold. They were very thankful that we found them and that we took them in,’ Eddie Pereira, who was captain of the rescue boat, told ABC News. The capsizing survivors suffered from slight hypothermia and were shaken by the ordeal, but denied medical treatment and set out for home after being examined by first responders. Salem Harbormaster Mil McHugh told the station WCVB that the armature seafarers had no waterproof means of portable communication or any distress equipment aboard the Ark Angel. Unscathed: Schaeffer (pictured) and his friend were examined by paramedics, but declined medical attention and set out for home . Reynolds, who owns a small welding fabrication business, said that he's been teaching Bible courses at a New Hampshire prison for more than 25 years and that he and Schaeffer attend church together. ‘My best friend was with me and we kind of dealt with it the best way we could,’ Reynolds saidUnfortunately your browser does not support IFrames.","George Reynolds and Fred Schaeffer were sailing to Boston in their 25-foot trimaran when the wind picked up .

A mother who was battered unconscious by a woman in an unprovoked attack was offered £150 by police to drop the charges - so they could avoid filling out paperwork. Hayley Clayton, 32, spent a night in hospital and needed 10 stitches after she was punched in the head and knocked out during a night out in Spalding, Lincolnshire. She received a call from police three weeks later saying they believed they knew who her attacker was and were making an arrest. Victim: Hayley Clayton, pictured left, needed 10 stitches, pictured right, after a Lithuanian woman punched her in the head during a night out in Spalding, Lincolnshire . The mother-of-one, from nearby Moulton Seas End,  then got another call the next day telling her they had a Lithuanian woman in custody and she had admitted the assault. But she was 'disgusted' when officers said she would not be prosecuted because it was a waste of taxpayers’ money. Mrs Clayton claims police said her attacker could either be cautioned or write a letter of apology and pay her £100 compensation. When Mrs Clayton and husband Mark, 39, turned down the offer, police called back and said the woman had a solicitor with her and was willing to offer an extra £50. Despite again turning down the offer of cash, police still refused to press charges and let the woman off with a caution. Mrs Clayton, pictured with her husband Mark and two-year-old daughter Kacey, was told her attacker could pay her compensation or be cautioned but would not be taken to court . Mrs Clayton today blasted police and said she had lost confidence in the law. She said: 'I was so offended I told them to stick their money and chose the caution because I wanted her to have a record in case she does this again. 'It is disgusting that you can buy your way out of committing a crime. What is our country coming to? 'I don’t blame the officers because they are doing their job. 'But the system is not right, people shouldn’t be able to offer money to get out of having a criminal record when they have punched someone unconscious for no reason whatsoever.' Mrs Clayton, who works as a team leader at a florist factory, lives in her husband and their two-year-old daughter Kacey. Lincolnshire Police today defended their decision not to prosecute the woman. Inspector Jim Tyner said: 'The aim of the adult caution scheme is to offer a proportionate response where the offender has admitted the offence. 'Cautions are designed to deliver swift, simple and effective justice that also carries a deterrent effect for first-time offenders. 'We also record an individual’s criminal conduct for possible future reference. 'This is not about taking short-cuts, but cautions are effectively used to increase the amount of time my officers spend dealing with other crime and reduce the amount of time they spend completing paperwork and attending court. Proportionate: Lincolnshire Police defended the decision not to prosecute Mrs Clayton's attacker and said the adult caution was proportionate to the crime committed . 'Like most people, I would much rather my officers are out on patrol. 'Where a victim has suffered financial loss as a result of an assault, they can apply to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority.' The force uses three out-of-court disposals for crimes which can be dealt with by police without clogging up the courts, including warnings with compensation and cautions. Chief Inspector Philip Baker, from the force's criminal justice department, said: 'Without knowing the full details in this case a caution or condition caution with compensation may have been appropriate. 'A restorative resolution, where compensation or an apology is made without a caution is usually applied in low level crimes such as when children put a window through.'","Hayley Clayton, 32, needed 10 stitches after she was punched in the head .

Nine-year-old Jaiden Newcomer had won the 255-pound giant pumpkin after correctly guessing its weight at a local Oktoberfest celebration near his home in York City. The pumpkin was so large that it took four adult family members to lift it and a wheelbarrow to manouvre it when the family went to take it home. Jaiden Newcomer, 9, had won the giant pumpkin - reported to weigh 220-pounds - after correctly guessing its weight at a local Oktoberfest celebration near his home in York City, Pennsylvania . Jaiden had been proudly displaying his prized possession on his family's front porch until it was stolen last week. Amy Newcomer, Jaiden’s mom, admits the family though they had seen the last of the pumpkin and she assumed that someone had destroyed it. ‘I never thought it would actually be returned,’ she told YorkDispatch.com. Then on Sunday evening the family returned home after being away for the weekend to find the pumpkin had been mysteriously returned to their front porch. Even more surprising, there was a note attached apologizing for the theft. The note said: ‘I'm really sorry about taking your pumpkin, it was wrong of me, you earned the pumpkin, I didn't think my actions through nor realize who they were affecting.

Landmark case: An appeal against the sentence given to Stuart Hall could be among the first cases to be televised live later this year . An appeal against the 'lenient' jail sentence given to sex attacker Stuart Hall could be televised live on television this October. The former broadcaster's 15-month prison term for indecently assaulting young girls over three decades prompted outrage from campaigners last month. The Attorney General Dominic Grieve has received around 150 complaints and is currently considering whether to appeal the sentence. If the appeal goes ahead, it could be one of the first cases to be heard live before television cameras which are to be allowed in courts in England and Wales for the first time since 1925. The move comes as a landmark documentary is due to be shown on Channel 4 which captures an entire murder trial. Award-winning documentary maker Nick Holt was allowed unprecedented access to all proceedings in the retrial of Nat Fraser - a . businessman who was convicted for murdering his wife Arlene. After three years of negotiation, Holt's team was given permission to film . the judge, lawyers, defendant and witnesses. Her . body has never been found, there is no weapon, no crime scene and her . husband appeared to have a cast iron alibi for the day she disappeared. With . over 70 witnesses and 104 pieces of evidence the complex case was . dissected firstly by the prosecution QC Alex Prentice and then the defence QC John Scott. Judges' verdicts and sentencing will be allowed in the Royal Courts of Justice from October . Nat . Fraser was first brought to trial in 2003 for the murder of his wife and was found guilty. But Fraser argued that the trial was a miscarriage . of justice and challenged the verdict. His conviction was quashed in 2011 but Fraser was sent back to court for a fresh trial in April last year. He was found guilty of murder for a second time and sentenced to a minimum of 17 years in prison. The two-hour documentary, The Murder Trial, will be broadcast on Tuesday July 9 at 9pm on Channel 4. Nick Holt told the Independent: 'We . have a right to see this process which costs us an enormous amount of . money and which we are very good at and very thorough at. 'There is . nothing to hide, nothing shameful going on. The process of filming . demystifies the legal process.' Unprecedented: In a legal first, a documentary crew were able to film the retrial of Nat Fraser, left, convicted of murdering his wife Arlene, right, at the Scottish High Court for a second time . Access: Cameras were allowed to follow an entire case - including to its court room climax - for the Channel 4 documentary Murder Trial, pictured . Historic: In a first in British legal history, cameras recorded legal proceedings from inside the court room . Warning: Some legal experts have warned opening up the court room to cameras could harm justice . Broadcasters . will be allowed into the Court of Appeal from October and this is . likely to be extended to crown court prosecutions. Lord Judge said he takes 'a very strong view' about cameras being turned on during sentencing . It will be for the broadcasters to determine which cases are televised, subject to necessary judicial checks. That . means the cases likely to be carried live will be high profile trials . involving celebrities and child murderers, like Soham killer Ian . Huntley, Stuart Hazell, who was recently convicted of murdering Tia . Sharp and Mark Bridger, the killer of April Jones. The opening up of courts to cameras has sparked a heated debate within the legal profession. Earlier this year The Lord Chief . Justice warned that allowing court broadcasts would lead to judges being . booed and heckled when verdicts are announced. Lord . Judge said: ‘I’m very troubled about having cameras just swanning . around,’ he said, saying he takes ‘a very strong view’ about cameras . being turned on during sentencing. Judges will have the final say over which cases can be televised. A senior source said: ‘In some cases it will not be in the interests of justice to broadcast footage.’ The judges will be able to ban the cameras in those cases but will have to explain their reasons. ‘The presumption will be that the cameras are allowed in unless there is a very good reason why not,’ the source said. Open justice: In future, the trials of child killers such as Stuart Hazell, left, and Mark Bridger, right, could be broadcast live on television . At the outset, cameras will be placed in certain courts at the Royal Courts of Justice. Prime Minister David Cameron and . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling have pushed for greater openness in the . courts in England and Wales following criticism that the antiquated . courts system is unaccountable and old fashioned. A . No 10 source said: ‘This is an important step in opening up the court . process. Allowing the public to watch justice in action will help build . trust in our judicial system. ‘Hearing why verdicts have been given and watching the sentencing process will add to public confidence in the courts.’","Former broadcaster's case could be one of the first to be televised .

Helen Southall works as a grass analyst, making sure gardeners and groundsmen have cut their lawn to the right length . The green-fingered grass expert works at British Seed Houses, Lincolnshire making sure the grass is growing in the most efficient way possible. The 43-year-old said: 'People do think it’s strange when I tell them my job is to watch grass grow, but I think it’s fascinating and I wouldn’t do anything else. 'I monitor different types of grass seeds and make sure they grow properly and the plants are fit for purpose. 'It’s so rewarding seeing a stretch of perfect green grass and knowing that it has grown right because of my work. Green-fingers: The grass expert works at British Seed Houses, Lincolnshire, making sure the grass grows in the most efficient way possible . Scientific: Helen Southall will take some samples into a lab where they are tested . Tedious: Her working day begins by counting out 400 grass seeds and goes through each blade by hand every week to ensure the growth is right . 'Sometimes grass grows too tall too quickly which damages the roots, and sometimes it doesn’t grow enough because of disease. It’s my job to watch for this and discover the reason why it is happening.' Mrs Southall from Timberland, Lincolnshire, went straight into seed testing after leaving school and has taken special grass related courses to build up her knowledge. A typical day’s work sees her individually counting out 400 grass seeds - and going through each blade by hand every week to measure growth. Perfect length: The grass experts says blades of grass should grow by about 5cm every two weeks . She added: 'I have to make sure that each grass seedling is not damaged, broken or split. 'The grass should reach about 5cm in 14 days and if I can see it hasn’t grown that much then I know there is a problem.' Mrs Southall looks after the quality control of the seed and ensures the grass seed meets standards for germination and purity so that grass seed buyers get high quality seed and value for money. She said: 'We plant grass seed in fields in September and inspect the grass in its natural environment.' Passionate: Her job might sound boring, but the 43-year-old tells people it is fascinating and loves spending all day outdoors . Despite her seemingly dull job description, Helen loves her job and the challenges involved in creating golfing greens and well seeded sports pitches. She said: 'Although aspects of my job can be a bit tedious, like individually counting out grass seeds, it changes throughout the year with the agricultural season.

Murdered: Drummer Lee Rigby was hacked to death near Woolwich Barracks in south east London on May 22 this year . The father of murdered soldier Lee Rigby has blasted the Ministry of Defence for scrapping his unit under controversial military cuts . Grieving Ian Rigby said ministers were 'hurting a lot of families' by disbanding the 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (2RRF) to save money. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has ignored critics to press ahead with axing some of the Army's most distinguished battalions to reduce personnel from 102,000 to 82,000 - its lowest strength in more than 250 years. Yet campaigners claim the 2RRF is one of the best recruited regiments in the Armed Forces, while some battalions that have been saved are hugely under-strength. Mr Rigby spoke out as hundreds of veterans attended a protest march in Westminster on Tuesday against the scrapping of a historic battalion. His 25-year-old son, a married father of a little boy, survived bombs and bullets in Afghanistan with his regiment only to be hacked to death in a terror attack in broad daylight outside Woolwich Barracks, south-east London, in May. Two men have denied his murder. Urging the Government to rethink the decision, Mr Rigby said: 'They [2RRF] are like a clan of brothers, and that family has closed around us. They've taken us into their family, and that's what the Fusiliers is all about. 'Take away the heart of a regiment, it takes away the history, and it hurts a lot of families. Once a Fusilier, always a Fusilier.' Wearing distinctive red-and-white plumes in their berets, the former Fusiliers marched to the sound of a fife and drum band as they delivered a petition opposing the cuts to Downing Street. The 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers has five companies with 600 personnel. It is an infantry battalion of the regiment which has served in conflicts since 1674. Fusiliers Association chairman Colonel Ian Brazier - who heckled the Defence Secretary as a 'disgrace' during his Conservative Party conference speech last month - led the parade. He said: 'It makes absolutely no sense for 2RRF to be disbanded. Protest: Former members of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers march from Downing Street after handing in a petition to save the battalion earlier this week . Marching on Parliament: The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers will be cut as part of government plans to replace 20,000 regular forces with 30,000 reservists . Brothers: Colleagues acted as pall bearers carrying the coffin of father-of-one Lee Rigby earlier this year, Mr Rigby this week described how his family had been supported by his son's former regiment in the aftermath of his murder . Grieving: Lyn and Ian Rigby pictured at their son's funeral at Bury Parish church in Greater Manchester in July . 'The Government has spoken about efficiencies and cost savings, but there is no explanation for this unfathomable decision. 'This has been a striking demonstration of poor management and leadership on the Government's part, to say nothing of the betrayal of the hundreds of men who have served in the battalion.' Fusilier groups from key recruiting grounds of Northumberland, Lancashire and Warwickshire joined the march. Tory MP John Baron, a former Fusilier, said: 'The axing of 2RRF proves the Government's mishandling of these army reforms. 'It makes no sense to save less well-recruited - and therefore more expensive - battalions. 'It is yet more evidence that Government plans to replace 20,000 regulars with 30,000 reservists are on the rocks. 'Replacing regular troops with reservists will be expensive and lead to unacceptable manpower and capability gaps, but the Government seems determined to plough on blindly.' The MoD said the cuts were planned to make the Army more 'adaptable to future challenges'. A spokesman said: 'We have been clear that the regular Army is becoming smaller and over a year ago we also announced changes to its structure so it is more reflective of the complex global situation. 'To suggest decisions were taken on recruitment performance alone is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Army's process.' * Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, have pleaded not guilty to murdering Drummer Rigby. The pair also deny separate counts of attempting to murder police officers who arrived at the scene in Woolwich.","The 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers are being disbanded as part of government money saving measures .

Nottinghamshire council says there is some evidence that better pavements encourage people to use them more. But residents in the county are baffled by the council's priorities, questioning why so much money is being spent on improving adequate pavements, and how the council thinks better walkways will help tackle the growing problem of obesity. Big problem: The East Midlands has the worst levels of obesity in the country. Nottinghamshire Council hopes improving its pavements will help tackle the problem . Emma McFarlane, 68, of Stapleford, said: 'We hear that money is tight, so why is the council spending money on pavements that are all right?' She added: 'How will that help obese people get fit anyway?' Her skepticism was also shared by Jo Eftekhari, who runs the Stapleford branch of Slimming World. 'Improving the pavements isn’t the first thing that I would think of when it came to ways to beat obesity,' she said. Councils across the country were awarded grants earmarked for improving roads and pavements as part of a government scheme. Extreme weather in recent years has left many roads and walkways needing repairs, left with cracks and potholes. The council has selected areas with the highest incidence of obesity, including Stapleford, pictured, for pavement improvements . Obese: The East Midlands is officially the fattest region in Britain according to recent research . In Nottinghamshire's case, the council was given £1.5million to improve roads and £500,000 for its walkways. A council spokesman told the Mail Online that this amount was just a 'drop in the ocean' compared to what was needed to improve the entirety of the council's pavements. Therefore, councillors decided to prioritise improvements where levels of obesity were highest, in a bid to encourage people to walk more, as opposed to drive. The spokesman said: 'There's evidence to suggest that where that has been implemented before it has been associated with a better use of pavements.' He said that when pavements near schools have been improved, there was 'anecdotal evidence' to suggest that more parents were walking their children to school. Earmarked: The government cash was earmarked for road and pavement improvements. Eastwood will be getting a makeover since there is a high rate of obesity among its residents. Right, a pavements in Stapleford . He said that the 'bottom line' was that the council 'hoped it would encourage healthy lifestyles'. People in the East Midlands are officially the fattest in Britain, with more hospital admissions for obesity-related illnesses than anywhere else in the country. The council's public health department drew up a list of areas in Nottinghamshire where levels of obesity were highest. The Nottinghamshire district of Bassetlaw had the most obesity-linked hospital admissions with 2,878 per 100,000 people last year. However, this district is not on the list for improvements. Councillors selected five areas with the highest incidence of obesity, coupled with the highest need of walkways repairs, and decided to improve the pavements in these areas. They are: Eastwood, Brinsley, Stapleford, East Retford, Central Newark. Andy Warrington, the county council’s service director for highways, said: 'It’s all about encouraging people to lead healthier lifestyles and is part of a wider package.' Opposition spokesman for highways and transport Richard Jackson said: 'I support the investment in pavements, but don’t think it will have the desired outcome of tackling obesity.' Work will now begin to identify footpaths to local schools and shops that need revamping to encourage people to walk more using obesity prevalence data and footway condition surveys.","Nottinghamshire Council selected 'fattest' areas for pavement improvements .

Researches are refusing to hand over a . list of buildings in Los Angeles which they say are liable to collapse . if an earthquake strikes. Professor Jack Moehle, from UC Berkeley, previously said he would hand the list to city officials without making it public for fear of being sued. However, . a spokesman for the Mayor Eric Garcetti said that when his office . requested the list in order to make a head-start on tackling the . problem, they were told they couldn't have it. Which ones? A list of Los Angeles' buildings in danger of crumbling in the next big quake is being held back by UC Berkeley researchers . Last weekend scientists warned that a . 6.7 magnitude earthquake is almost certain to happen on the West Coast . in the next 30 years and if it does 1,500 ageing buildings in LA could . turn into death traps. The research team, lead by engineering professor Moehle, looked at public records and . did a walking survey in order to establish which properties were at . risk. The team found modest homes, . millionaire high rises, and factories with outdated . concrete constructions that had slipped through the cracks of city ordinances. The Los Angeles Times reported Sunday . that the buildings are susceptible . because they do not contain enough steel reinforcing bars to sustain . them during the sideways shaking triggered by a large quake. Neither Professor Jack Mohele, who lead the study, nor any of his team responded to requests for comment by the Times. LA . officials have known about the dangers for more than 40 years but have . failed to force owners to make their properties safer or to compile a . list of endangered buildings, according to the Times. The . Times compiled its own list using many of the same methods the . scientists did. The newspaper had a team of reporters research thousands . of city and county records to identify older buildings. Awaiting disaster? The iconic Capitol Records building (left) was identified by the LA Times as one of 1,000 outdated structures in danger of collapse in the next big Southern California earthquake, as was Hollyood's Guaranty building, now home to the Church of Scientology . The . reporters visited the buildings themselves, checked building . permits and interviewing owners to see what if any quake-safety upgrades . had been made over the years. The . analysis concluded that more than 1,000 structures are at risk, with . more than 50 in Los Angeles likely to fall down, putting thousands of . people at risk. Many of . these at-risk buildings include landmarks and . buildings frequented by many of LA’s 40 million visitors per year—such as the Capitol Records building, Pantages Theater, the . Hollywood Guaranty building, home to the Church of Scientology, and the . Avalon Hollywood nightclub. Many of the at-risk buildings were found to be in the Hollywood area, which is bisected by a fault capable of rocking the area with a direct 7.0 earthquake. Full house: The study pointed out the historic Avalon Theater as in danger of falling down in the next quake thanks to outdated construction. It is now a popular nightclub with a capacity for 2,000 people . LA’s downtown area, full of outdated . textile factories, is also at risk. This includes Scott Kim’s family . business, which his family paid $5 million for 10 years ago. ‘It . went through other earthquakes, and it's still here,’ Kim told the . Times. ‘I know back in the day they built buildings much sturdier than . buildings today.’ Metal skeleton: This reinforced concrete column shows today's construction. Metal rebar throughout prevents collapse. Older buildings lack such steel skeletons and are in danger of buckling and crushing those inside . However, Kim admits that no one walked him and his family through the seismic risks when they bought the place. Two earthquakes, Sylmar in 1971 and Northridge in 1994, killed 125 people, injured more than 9,000 and toppled two hospitals, an apartment building and several freeway overpasses, including one that was rebuilt after falling during the 1971 quake. More than 40,000 buildings were damaged across Southern California. A 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan . killed 6,000 and many were in concrete buildings. Another 133 people died in a . 2011 New Zealand quake after two non-reinforced concrete office . buildings were toppled. A . 2008 forecast gave 99 percent chance of a 6.7 magnitude quake in the . next three decades, and 46 percent chance of a 7.5 or greater, with . Southern California at the epicenter. Researchers . like Thomas Heaton of Caltech’s Earthquake Engineering Research . Laboratory worry it will take a deadly tragedy to create change. ‘We . know darn well that if a bunch of people die, there will be lots of . stories, lots of reports, things will change,’ Heaton said. ‘But the . question is, do we have to have lots of people die in order to make this . change?’ Historic: Hollywood's Pantages building is also at risk of collapse due to non-updated construction says the LA Times and scientists say the next big quake will likely come within the next 30 years . CONCRETE BOOM . The . City of Angels saw a massive population influx in the 1920s and a huge . rush to build homes and business to accommodate the new Angelenos. The era saw a concrete structures spring up en-masse, helping to pave the way toward the sprawling Los Angeles seen today. In the 1970s, concrete towers began to line LA's famous avenues, like the historic Capitol Records building. Pancaked: An aerial shot of an LA building that pancaked following the 1994 Northridge quake. Outdated, non-reinforced concrete structures routinely collapse during powerful earthquakes and many such buildings remain in LA . CONCRETE BUST . In 1971, the 6.6 Sylmar earthquake killed 52 people after the concrete structures failed to withstnd the tremor. On such building was the 3-storey San Fernando Valley VA Hospital which collapsed, crushing patients in their beds. The magnitude 6.7 Northridge earthquake in 1994 saw even more concrete structures destroyed. As . a result of the two disasters the city tightened regulations for new . buildings and began retrofitting older sites with steel beams. However, attempts to force building owners to update their properties have largely been a failure. The work is costly and owners are either unwilling or unable to foot the bill.

Surgeon Puthur Damodaran has been accused of following a woman patient to her car and groping her while she trustingly let him re-examine her for back pain . A 'pervert' hospital surgeon followed a . patient to her car after examining her for back pain - and groped her . while she trustingly let him re-examine her, a jury has heard. The . 24-year-old blonde woman was molested in a secluded corner of the . hospital car park after the 40-year-old orthopaedic specialist climbed . into the car with her. The . jury was told that Puthur Damodaran allegedly felt her through her . clothes before putting one hand under her jeans and pulling at her top. The . woman, who had been upset at her back pain not being resolved during . the hospital appointment, said she became suspicious of Damodaran . continuously looking towards the hospital building and she asked him to . get out. She waited for a few minutes before returning to the orthopaedic clinic and reporting his behaviour to nurses. Prosecutor . Ruby Selva told the jury at Guildford Crown Court: 'There is a special . relationship between a medical professional and a patient. These are . professionals we should be able to trust. 'We leave ourselves wholly open, . especially if we are in pain. It is in these circumstances that this . defendant sexually assaulted the complainant. 'He did so to satisfy his own perverse needs, banking on the implicit trust we, as members of the public, have in doctors.' She explained the woman had gone to Leatherhead Hospital, in Surrey, on July 9 last year, to receive the results of a scan. Her . usual doctor was not there and she was seen instead by 40-year-old . orthopaedic surgeon Damodaran, with a nurse 'chaperone' present. The scans had apparently not shown anything to explain her back and leg pain and a full report had not been completed, and the patient left upset and angry. She made another appointment and left the building and was walking to her car when she noticed someone trying to get her attention. It was the surgeon. 'He was saying: ""Don’t get so upset. I’m sure we’ll be able to do something"",' she told police in an interview played to the court. 'I thought it was really nice of him to try to calm me down and cheer me up.' After some general chit-chat and asking about her pain, he was alleged to have said to her: 'I think I forgot to check something but I need you to sit down'. 'Basically he invited himself to my car,' said the patient. He quickly went to his car to drop something off, before returning. With her sitting in the driver’s seat, he got into the passenger seat and began feeling the areas she said were painful. Patient: The woman, who can not be named for legal reasons, had gone to Leatherhead Hospital, in Surrey, on July 9 last year, to receive the results of a scan . She said he asked her to put her seat back and continuously told her to relax, as the 'examination' went further. 'I should not have done it but he was a doctor. I trusted him,' she told police. 'I felt really weird and awkward about it but I thought because he’s a doctor there isn’t anything to worry about. 'I noticed he kept looking towards the hospital and I realised. I said: ""I’m just going to wait for the scan result"". 'He said: ""Are you sure?"" And I said: ""Yes, please can you leave my car?”' She told the police Damodaran then stood by her car, still talking to her. 'It was wrong, the way he was looking at me,' she said. The interviewing officer then asked: 'How would you say he was looking at you?' 'Like a pervert,' said the woman. She explained that after waiting for . five to 10 minutes to ensure the doctor had left, she went back into the . hospital, asked to see the nurse who had been in the appointment and . told her what had happened. Trial: Dr Damodaran is being tried at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey. He denies a single charge of sexual assault . The . nurse reported the matter to a supervisor and they apparently told the . patient that what had happened was wrong and they apologised and gave . her details of how to make a formal complaint. Damodaran, . of Tanyard Way, Horley, Surrey, was arrested and interviewed twice. He . issued police with a prepared statement in which he admitted brushing . the woman’s genitals through her clothes accidentally during the . appointment but denied conducting an examination in her car. He denies a single charge of sexual assault. Under cross-examination the woman victim insisted that the account she had given was correct. 'I felt really weird and awkward about it but I thought because he’s a doctor there isn’t anything to worry about' Woman Patient . Brendan . Finucane QC, for the defence, said: 'I don't deny, that because you . were still very upset, he said he would sit in your car and talk to . you.' 'I don't think so,' said the complainant. Mr Finucane asked: 'Well, how did he get in your car then?' She replied: ""He said he needed to check something and I needed to straighten my leg.' The defence put to her that there was no need to examine her further or ask any of the questions she alleged were put, as it had already been covered during the hospital appointment. Mr Finucane also suggested the layout of her small car would have made what she had alleged impractical. He asked whether a later appointment had been brought forward by the hospital following her complaint, which she said had happened. Judge Christopher Critchlow then asked her: 'Did you make a complaint in the hope you would get seen sooner?' She answered: 'Definitely not. I just wanted to make sure it didn't happen to anyone else. 'It could have been your family, your daughter, sister. He's meant to be a doctor and not touch you the way he touched me and not in my car. 'I've learned my lesson. I'm not as naive and trusting. I've got no reason to make this up.' The trial, before Judge Christopher Critchlow at Guildford Crown court, continues.","Puthur Damodaran, 40, accused of groping patient while re-examining her .

Sydney Cawsey died alongside his father John, 39, after their Merchant Navy vessel was shelled on March 12, 1917. The Devon teenager worked as a cook on a 172 tonne wooden schooner called the S.V. Reward, which was mastered by his father John Carter Cawsey. Medals: The medals awarded posthumously to Sydney Cawsey have sold to an anonymous telephone bidder for £1,000 . The father and son were . part of a crew transporting troops and coal from Falmouth in Devon to . Guernsey when they came under heavy fire from a a German UC-72 . submarine. Sydney . received the British War Medal and Mercantile Marine War Medal . posthumously, becoming one of the youngest ever recipients of the . awards. Yesterday the . pair of medals sold to an anonymous telephone bidder for £1,000 at an . auction in Hazel Grove, Cheshire - beating its estimated sale price of . between £600 and £800. Valour: Sydney Cawsey, seen left with his older brother Jack, was one of the youngest victims of the First World War . Medals . Expert Andrew McCann, from Maxwells Auctioneers, who handled the sale, . said: 'It really was quite a special piece because of the fascinating . back story and I think that is what generated the interest. 'It is very rare to get this much for such normal medals that would have been widely dished out among ordinary seamen. 'They don't really tell the full story of the boy's bravery. 'The . boys age meant there was a lot of interest in the lot and they . eventually went to a private collector who bid by telephone,' he added. Sydney . was among 10 other boys aged under 15 who served in the Merchant Navy . during the Great War, and one of only a handful who were killed in . action. His father gained the Torpedo Badge medal, which he was posthumously awarded for his service on a different vessel. Figures show 14,287 British merchant navy sailors died during World War One. The deadly German UC-72 submarine downed 38 ships during the war using a deadly combination of torpedoes and mines. Mr McCann added: 'Only a handful of boys Sydney's age would have served in the Merchant Navy. 'There has been some confusion over his age, because his descendants who gave us the lot believed him to be 15. Poignant: John Carter Cawsey, left, died alongside his teenage son, right, on board the Merchant Navy vessel . 'But records in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission show him to be 14. 'However, . when we dug further we saw that the 1911 census put his birth year as . 1904, which would make him 13 years and nine months old - one of the . youngest sailors in the war. 'The . fact he died with his father makes it such a poignant story, because in . all my years of historical study we have never encountered a similar . instance.' Sydney and . John were sailing with ship's mate John Mactaggart Taylor, Dubliner . Andrew McLoughlin, and Edward Campbell, who was born in Barbados. Despite . the risk of attack from enemy submarines John's wife Mary Anne and his . daughter would sometimes accompany them on their trips up and down the . channel.

Hundreds of protesters have clashed with police in Brazil as the government was set to announce the result of a controversial auction of exploration rights for the country's biggest oilfield. But it seemed that some Brazilians retained their laid-back cool amid the scenes of upset, by continuing to sunbathe throughout. Brazilian security forces and protesters clashed in Barra da Tijuca, near Rio de Janeiro, where today the government was auctioning the massive - and potentially lucrative -  Libra offshore oil block. The government deployed more than a thousand troops around the beach front Windsor hotel where the auction will take place.

Officers cordoned off streets to prevent . protesters from disrupting an event that President Dilma Rousseff has . billed as a crowning achievement of an energy plan aimed at ending . poverty and vaulting Brazil to the ranks of developed nations. The . field was discovered in 2010, and could almost double Brazil’s oil . reserves, garnering more than £100bn investment over 35 years. The protesters include members of unions representing oil workers, who have accused the government of 'selling off' and privatising Brazil's natural riches. Members have been on strike since Thursday at more than 40 oil platforms and refineries. Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras, would be the sole operator of the field according to the terms. As part of the agreement more than 40 per cent of recovered oil would go to the state. Brazilian officials are counting on the oil riches to quickly catapult the nation to developed-world status. State officials are locked in arguments about how to split royalties that haven't surfaced, the Navy is buying submarines to protect the fields and left-wing protesters like those demonstrating on Monday demand that the entire industry be nationalised so Brazil doesn't share a drop of the wealth. But the technology hurdles to reaching the riches are intensely challenging, even for Petrobras, considered a world leader in offshore development.

A Brazil's Forca Nacional security member aims his shotgun at activists demonstrating in front of the hotel. Police were said to have fired rubber bullets into the crowds . The deep-water reservoirs lie some 185 miles (300 kilometers) offshore in the Atlantic, more than a mile below the ocean's surface and under another 2.5 miles  of earth and corrosive salt. The salt beds can break loose and shear off piping, making it one of the toughest substances to drill. With a slowing economy and delays in producing that offshore oil, some say the Brazilian government will loosen rules to make them more business friendly when the next auction is held in two to three years. The New York-based Eurasia Group said in a research note that Petrobras' 'growing operational and financial constraints' along with government pressure to stoke a lagging national economy means changes are expected at the next auction. About 300 protesters hoping to halt the oil auction tossed tear gas canisters back at police and overturned the car of one local TV channel, setting it aflame . A bloodied protester is helped after being injured during clashes with the national guard . A masked activist shows rubber bullets shot by security forces at demonstrators . 'Allowing international oil companies to develop the pre-salt side by side with Petrobras would kill two birds with one stone,' Eurasia Group wrote. 'It would lead to a quicker pace of production in the pre-salt with more investments, and provide needed relief to Petrobras.' It added that 'it isn't lost on government officials that the shale gas and tight oil technological revolution in North America has reduced Brazil's leverage to attract capital.'

The demonstration was originally called by striking oil workers, whose union has long been against any foreign involvement in Brazil's petroleum production.","Security forces and protesters clashed in Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro .

A California teenager convicted of murdering an aspiring boxer after baiting him with a fake Facebook profile has been sentenced to life in prison. Manuel Edmundo Guzman Jr, 19, of San Jacinto, was convicted earlier this year of setting up a fake Facebook profile using the picture of an internet model and then killing Eddie Leal, 23, when he showed up to meet the non-existent woman. Mr Guzman was only 17 when he shot Mr Leal to death, prohibiting the prosecution from seeking the death penalty, according to the Los Angeles Times. Edmundo Guzman Jr, left, used this picture of a 'curvy', 'seductive' model, left, in a false Facebook account for a fictional woman known as Rebecca Santhiago to lure men. Prosecutors claim he then shot a man who came to meet the fictional woman in a 'thrill kill' Mr Guzman admitted to the killing during a preliminary hearing, officials skipped the trial and went directly to the sentencing, the Times noted. The murderer will spend the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole after officials claimed . Guzman's motive was to kill for a 'thrill.' Mr Guzman's 'thrill kill' of Mr Leal came after exchanging messages with the professional bantamweight . boxer with the fake account under the name Rebecca Santhiago, officials said. The account is still active on Facebook. The account paints a picture of a single 21-year-old, who 'loves to kick it at house parties or clubs' and asks for men to 'show some love and maybe we can hang out.' Prosecutors described the photo used as showing 'a curvy, attractive, young brunette in a tight dress who was smiling seductively.' Mr Leal began Facebook messaging 'Santhiago' and a meeting was arranged in a San Jacinto park at around 2 am on May 30, 2011, it is alleged. The prosecution claims that when Mr Leal arrived he encountered Mr Guzman, who shot him several times, in what attorneys describe as a 'thrill kill.' Upcoming boxer, Eddie Leal, 23, was found shot dead in his car. Prosecutors claim that he was lured to a meeting point and then murdered by Manuel Edmundo Guzman . Mr Leal died at the scene and authorities found the up and coming boxer in the driver's seat of his Toyota Corolla in Roanoke Street, San Jacinto. After a year-long investigation, detectives allegedly tracked the bogus Facebook profile to a computer at Mr Guzman’s mother’s house, where he lived. Investigator Tony Pelato, a computer forensics expert, told The Press Enterprise that he had 'no doubt at all' that Santhiago’s chat messages were typed on Mr Guzman’s computer. A copy of the Facebook page and the chat messages were reportedly also found on the victim's computer. Guzman was arrested and charged on April 10, 2012. He was already on probation for a juvenile conviction the previous year. According to the prosecution, the victim came to meet the fictional woman at this street corner but instead was fatally shot .","Edmundo Guzman Jr, 19, accused of using a picture of an internet model in a false Facebook account to lure men .

The General Dental Council has now announced that Trail, who also used her ill-gotten gains to send her grandchildren to private school, had been struck off following a hearing of its Professional Conduct Committee. A spokesman said: 'The gravity of Trail’s convictions offended fundamental standards of behaviour expected of a member of the dental profession. 'Her convictions go to her character and her actions are incapable of remedy. She has brought the profession into disrepute and remains subject to the lengthy custodial sentences imposed upon her by the court.'

Marjorie and Winifred, who live in a nursing home, are known as 'the Twins' and do everything together. Winifred’s son Nolan Witt said: 'They are inseparable - it has always been that way, from the day they were born, to the day they will die. 'There were times when we didn’t know which one was which, even as their children. I’m sure there were some boyfriends along the way who were the same.' The pair were born in 1913, and through their childhood they shared clothes, books and even a bed.Marjorie’s . daughter, Ann Eccleshare, said: 'I remember my Auntie Win saying to me . she cried herself to sleep the night Marjorie got married, because that . was the first night she had ever slept alone. It’s lovely the way they . have grown old so happily and sweet-natured together.' Together forever: the twins aged just six months (left, with Marjorie on the left) and aged 81 (Marjorie on right) Both sisters married aged 21 but they were determined not to live apart and so they moved both their families into one house in Pontrhydyrun, South Wales, during the war.

Gwyneth Virgo, manager of the nursing home they share, said: 'They are real characters the two of them. They come alive at night.

Previous collections have made liberal use of snakeskin and sequins, and this latest range sees Twiggy rock the leather look, with a metallic gold skirt just in time for the festive season. The AW13 and SS14 collections see the return of some of Twiggy’s personal favourites, from the perfect lace dress to the classic 'jegging' and jersey t-shirt, alongside some exciting new wardrobe must-haves including leather and knitwear, such as a colour block shift dress with figure flattering jersey panels. Twiggy models items from her new collection out on Thursday, including a festive jumper and smart work suit . The SS14 collection, due to launch in February, has a distinctive new look and feel, incorporating stunning new prints and modern shaping into the collection.

Mr Blackburn told the first-tier tribunal that he and wife abjure the use of computers, the internet, televisions and mobile phones in their home. The contents of some TV programmes and websites were ‘contrary to the Bible’s teachings’ in his view and he wanted to ‘protect his children from bad influences’. The beekeeper said people were obsessed by their mobile phones - treating them as ‘idols’ - and that the flood of electronic communications had ‘blinded the minds of non-believers’, giving them no time for religion in their lives. Most businesses have been required by law to file their VAT returns online since April last year, and HMRC lawyers argued that the couple’s stance was ‘really a personal preference and not part of their religion.’ The beekeepers, who run Cornish Moorland Honey, refuse to use the internet or watch TV (file picture) Philip Woolfe, for the tax authorities, pointed out that the Seventh Day Adventist Church does not ban its members from using the internet - merely extoling them to avoid ‘unwholesome’ or ‘sordid’ influences in the mass media - and in fact has its own website. However, Tribunal Judge Barbara Mosedale ruled that by refusing to exempt Mr and Mrs Blackburn from online filing, HMRC had breached their right to freely manifest their religion, enshrined in Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights. She said the couple’s decision not to use computers was more than just a preference to keep ‘bad’ content out of their home and away from their children but was an expression of their fundamental religious beliefs. She said: 'I find that, by entirely shunning computers, the Blackburns considered they were acting, as the Bible required them to do, in accordance with their religious conscience. 'They were manifesting their religious beliefs by refusing to use computers.' Justifications put forward by HMRC for refusing to exempt the couple were ‘clearly insufficient’, she concluded.","Owners of Cornish Moorland Honey company refuse to use the internet .

Scientists are working to unravel why there has been a surge in the number of beached dolphins found along the eastern coast of the U.S.. A total of 44 bottlenose dolphins were found in July, washed up along the southern part of Chesapeake Bay in Virginia - around eight times as many as normal, according to the Virginia Aquarium Stranding Response Team. Researchers are struggling to work out the cause of the deaths, but suspect a virus is to blame, as a similarly morbid bout of dolphin deaths occurred in 1987 and were the result of a measles-like disease. Scientists are working to unravel the cause of a surge in the number of dolphin deaths as a number of stranded mammals have been found beached along East Coast US states. Volunteers Krystal Rodrique (left) and Liz Schell (right) record observations of a deceased male dolphin in Norfolk Virginia . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric . Administration has asked stranding centres situated along the coastline to record the number of dead dolphins found in a bid to find a pattern in the spikes. Susan Barco, research coordinator for the Virginia Aquarium & Marine Science Centre, told The Virginian-Pilot : 'We've had a steady number coming in at the beginning of the summer, and starting last week, the numbers spiked...We're just trying to keep our head above water.' The states of Delaware and Maryland has also seen a rise in dolphin deaths and according to a report in The Press of Atlantic City, around 10 dead dolphins were found in a month - double that than usually recorded. Scientists in New Jersey have reportedly said necropsy results have indicated pneumonia might be to blame, but a spokesman for NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service admitted no-one knows what is causing the mysterious dolphin deaths but data is being collected. The volunteers load a deceased male dolphin onto a metal stretcher on the beach in Virginia. This was their third dolphin retrieval of the day. Officials are trying to determine the cause of a sharp increase in dolphin deaths in Virginia and other East Coast states . However, the stranding team in Virginia . said the numbers of dolphins found beached reminds them of mass deaths . that occurred in 1987, when over 750 carcasses were washed ashore . between Florida and New Jersey. It took a few years to determine that morbillivirus - a disease similar to the measles - was to blame but the dolphins did show symptoms similar to those of measles and pneumonia. Ms Barco said: 'It's eerily familiar...That is one virus we're looking for now.' Bottlenose dolphins live in pods of . between two and 15 creatures off the East Coast of the US and spend the . majority of the year in the warmer southern waters, before moving to the . bays of the Mid-Atlantic between may and October, Bob Schoelkopf, director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in Brigantine, New Jersey, told The Huffington Post. Five beached dolphins like the one pictured were found in Virginia alone on Thursday. In July, nearly four dozen dead dolphins were found, mostly in Norfolk and along the southern part of the Chesapeake Bay - over six times the number usually picked up in July by the Virginia Aquarium Stranding Response Team . A total of 87 dolphin carcasses including those of the bottlenose species, have been collected by the response team in Virginia so far this year, compared to a usual count of 87 dolphins for the entire calendar year. Volunteers have had the unenviable task of collecting the dolphin remains - many of which are already very decomposed -  which are analysed by marine biologists. It is difficult for the scientists to gain valuable information about any suspected virus when the carcasses are in bad shape. Bottlenose dolphins, among the species found on the beaches, live in pods of between two and 15 creatures off the East Coast of the US and spend the majority of the year in the warmer southern waters, before moving to the bays of the Mid-Atlantic between may and October . While it appears sonar is not to blame for the dolphins deaths,it could be killing blue whales, according to a study by the Cascadia Research Collective based in Washington. It found baleen whale species, which include the blue whale, react to the mid frequency noises by changing behaviour. This includes altering foraging so they miss out on high-quality prey, which could make them weak and decimate numbers through starvation. The soundwaves, developed by the military to track enemies beneath the waves, are between 1 and 10 kHz, which is within the human hearing band. They have been blamed for lethal mass stranding of deep diving toothed whales. Sonar is thought to disrupt the animals’ diving behaviour so much that they suffer a condition rather like ‘the bends’. The volunteers are combing the coast to . find bodies of newly-dead dolphins to give the scientists a better . chance of finding animals that might help them come up with the reason for the deaths. Krystle Rodrique, a volunteer with the Virginia . Aquarium Stranding Response Team described the smell of the pinky-white . carcasses as a cross between a pet shop and rotting fish. She told The Virginian-Pilot: 'You get used to the smell, but I never can really get it off my hands...I try to scrub them over and over again.' Ms Barco said the volunteers have not seen any physical marks of trauma on the dolphins' bodies that would indicate they have gotten tangled in nets or confused by sonar systems used by the Navy, that have been blamed for whale and dolphin beachings in the past. Ted Brown, a spokesman for the Navy's Fleet Forces Command in Norfolk, told The Virginian-Pilot there has been no change or increase in sonar use that could be related to the increase in dolphin deaths. Around 60 volunteers plus interns and permanent staff are working in Virginia to determine the cause of the deaths but they do not have specialist labs and are working from tents.

Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi said in a statement today that the attack on Sunday night was a 'callous and criminal act'. He says such attacks will 'not succeed in sowing divisions between the nation's Muslims and Christians'. Since a popularly-backed military coup ousted the country's Islamist president in July, there have been stepped-up attacks against Egypt's Coptic Christians and their churches. Hundreds of Egyptians gathered in front of the Virgin Mary Coptic Christian church, in Cairo, after the fatal shooting of three people at a wedding . A health ministry official confirmed three people had been killed but said 12 people had in fact been wounded in the attack . Tensions between the two groups . escalated before the country's revolution in January 2011. But many . local people blamed such attacks on the government, claiming they were . to distract people from the country's bigger economic and social . problems. Clashes continued yesterday between police and hundreds of supporters of the country's . ousted Islamist president. Riot police besieged the protestors inside a prestigious Muslim . institution after stone-hurling protesters cut off a main road. Sunday's clashes marked the second day of unrest at Al-Azhar University, Sunni Islam's most prominent center of learning. Many supporters of ousted President Mohammed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood are students at Al-Azhar, a stronghold of the group. The campus is also near where Islamists had set up a sprawling protest camp that security forces raided in August, leaving hundreds dead and sparking days of unrest. The students' protest started with a march inside campus, where protesters hurled stones at the administrator's offices, smashing windows and breaking doors, said Ibrahim el-Houdhoud, deputy head of the university. He told satellite news channel Al-Jazeera Mubashir Misr that he warned protesters against leaving campus and clashing with security forces. Armed guards: Egyptian security forces stood guard at the church last night as hundreds of people stood outside the scene of the shooting into the streets . The protesters however ignored the . advice, marching out of the main gates to hold 'prayers for the dead' - . honoring students killed in earlier clashes between security forces and . protesters in July. The . protests come amid heated debate over a new law that would place tougher . restrictions on demonstrators, which includes imposing heavy fines and . possible jail time on violators. Morsi was overthrown by the military July 3 after millions took to the streets to demand he step down. Since then, Cairo has seen non-stop demonstrations by his supporters demanding his return.

A teenager who threatened to 'cut up' neighbours with his machete after they dared stand up to him has been evicted from his home after terrorising them for nine months. Reece Huskinson, 19, stood at one pregnant woman's back door with a knife, saying 'I'm going to kill your kids', and fired a pellet gun at another woman as she took the rubbish out, Blackpool magistrates were told. The court heard that police recorded 35 separate incidents of antisocial behaviour against Huskinson, who rented the three-bedroom terraced house in the Layton area of Blackpool, with his then girlfriend and her three children. Reece Huskinson, 19, pictured right with machete, has been evicted after terrorising neighbours in Blackpool . The teenager moved into the privately-rented home in Garrick Grove at the beginning of the year . The trouble began almost immediately he moved in to the quiet street of Garrick Grove in January this year and told one neighbour who stopped him racing up and down the street on his mini motorbike: 'You think this is trouble, wait for the trouble that is going to kick in.' He also took pot shots at neighbours with a ball-bearing pellet gun, threatened others with a baseball bat, threw bags of dog waste at children, kicked in doors and clambered across roofs to spy on women in their own homes. The cocky teenager would also be seen parading up and down the streets in just a vest and boxer shorts, and would allow his Staffordshire Bull Terrier to frighten local residents. Police obtained a closure order on Huskinson’s home after collating a dossier of evidence from his neighbours in the seaside resort, which enabled magistrates to grant a house closure order under the Anti Social Behaviour Act, forcing Huskinson out of the terraced house. Mother-of-two Tracy Fisher, 32, who lives in neighbouring Alder Grove, said: 'We are so relieved he’s gone as our lives were made a living hell. 'He didn’t have a job and I think he must have sat there every day plotting what to do next and how to terrorise people - every single person on the street had had a grievance with him. Nightmare neighbour: One resident said the teenager behaved 'as if he owned the whole street' 'We were ready to move because he threatened to petrol bomb the house. I had to keep the doors locked as we believed we were in danger. 'l was heavily pregnant and one night when he was kicking off, I went outside to confront him because my little boy was in bed. But he threatened to cut my kids up. 'I came back inside shaking, but he was up at the back door with a knife - I could see the blade shimmering. 'He said ""I’m going to kill your kids, I swear on my sister’s grave.""  I ended up going into labour two months early. He knew he was intimidating me.' Mrs Fisher added: 'He would rev the engine late into the evenings waking up my two-year-old son, but when I asked him to stop he just hurled abuse at me and it got worse from there. Closure order: A Closure Order made under the Anti Social Behaviour Act is taped to the house's windows . A tip: The terraced property in Garrick Grove has piles of rubbish in the back garden and is now boarded up . 'There was something every single day. He thought he owned the whole street.' She said he encouraged his girlfriend's children to throw dog faeces at people's houses, and sent his Staffordshire bull terrier into the house of a woman whose daughter is frightened of dogs. She added: 'He smeared dog poo on our doors - I was terrified it would get in my children’s eyes. One time he threw it in bags that had been split into the garden just as we were about to have my son’s second birthday party - we had to cancel it.' Mrs Fisher said Huskinson would climb onto the roof of his terraced house's extension and stare at her in her kitchen. She said: 'He used to sit there as I washed up so he could see me, and as I moved he would move along the roofs, leaping across all the extensions mouthing and jeering ‘""Come on come on"". I have never felt so sick in my life.' Good riddance: Huskinson has moved on from the terraced house but is thought to still be living in Blackpool . Another neighbour, Cheryl Cooksey, 26, said: 'He used to sit at the window firing his BB gun as I took the rubbish out. I heard this ping against my door and he had obviously been trying to hit me but thankfully he missed. 'I was forever getting my two children who are two and five back inside because I didn’t like them being outside on their own. I’m glad that he has gone.' 'You used to hear him every night on that bike circling the street, he even put his children on. He caused a lot of trouble.' Prosecutor Chris Keogh told Blackpool magistrates: 'Our evidence shows there was foul language used to adults and children, criminal damage, threatening behaviour, fly tipping and stone throwing. 'There was also incidents where dog dirt was thrown into neighbours homes.' After the case,  PCSO Lucy Hesketh of Lancashire Police said: 'We welcome the decision of the court to grant this initial three-month closure order and give the residents some respite from what was disruptive and disgraceful behaviour.' It is not known where Huskinson has moved on to, though he is believed to still be in the city.","Reece Huskinson, 19, intimidated residents of Garrick Grove, Blackpool .

Revellers caught using city centre streets as a public toilet have been ordered by police to pay up - or clean up. Armed with mops, buckets and disinfectant, police took to the Manchester streets this weekend to shame drunks who relieved themselves in the street. Drinkers spotted urinating in public were handed a warning letter by officers from Greater Manchester Police, before being given the choice of cleaning up their own mess or running the risk of an on-the-spot fine. On patrol: Revellers caught using Manchester city centre as a public toilet have been ordered by police armed with mops and buckets, including Police Constable Dave Willetts, to clean up their mess or face a fine . Although revellers cannot be fined for simply urinating in the street, GMP said that those who ‘kick off’ when challenged may find themselves having to pay up - £80 for drunk and disorderly or £50 for being drunk in public. The patrol - dubbed Operation Urination - caught four young men between 9pm and midnight. Among them were two football fans who had travelled from Ireland to see their beloved Manchester United play, only to be caught urinating in an alleyway across from the city's Deansgate Locks. The men, aged 22 and 27, were on the way to the Printworks complex of bars and restaurants, and said they simply couldn’t wait to use a toilet. Shamed: These two men were spotted by the police patrol, dubbed 'Operation Urination' urinating against walls near to Deansgate Locks, Manchester . Tough choice: Those caught relieving themselves by the police patrol are handed a letter before being given the option of cleaning up their mess or having to pay a fine . One, who works as an engineer in Ireland, said: 'I’ve had about 20 pints today so I was bursting. I thought it would be easiest just to nip down here, all guys do it.' However, Joan Davis, Labour councillor for the city centre, who accompanied police on the patrol, was not impressed by the excuses. She said: 'Not all guys do it. Many men will plan ahead so there is no need to urinate in the street, and you don’t see so many girls urinating in public. Somehow they manage to wait. 'Residents and business owners shouldn’t have to live with the smell and sight of urine. 'It’s unhygienic and unfair that they have to clean up other peoples’ mess.' One business owner with premises in Manchester's Northern Quarter said he faced a constant battle with urination - and even worse - outside the building. Scrub up well: These two revellers spotted urinating near Deansgate Locks chose to scrub the streets instead of running the risk of having to pay a hefty fine . He explained: 'Business is lost if clients come to the building and it looks and smells like a toilet. Bluntly, they will not return.' GMP will now continue to carry and hand out the letters on their regular patrols over the weekends leading up to the festive season. Although everybody stopped by police agreed to clean up their mess, not all were entirely repentant. A 21-year-old student from Baguley caught urinating in a corner of Castlefield said: 'If there were public toilets around here we wouldn’t have to do this. 'If I’m being honest I’d do this again if I didn’t think the police were watching. Although I wouldn’t ever do it outside someone’s house as that’s not fair.' Inspector Phil Spurgeon, who led the patrol, said that revellers often used the excuse of public toilet provision when challenged. He added: 'But in my experience most of those people have recently left premises with a toilet or are on their way to one. 'To put it bluntly, they should tie a knot in it.'","Greater Manchester Police shame revellers spotted relieving themselves .

Hurricane Raymond has strengthened to a Category 3 storm, threatening to hurl heavy rains onto a sodden region of Mexico's Pacific Coast already devastated by last month's Tropical Storm Manuel. Forecasters now fear that the rain could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides along the flooded south-central Mexican coast, where more than 130 people died in September's storm. Hurricane Raymond storm has nearly stalled offshore about 165 miles west-southwest of Acapulco, and it is expected to move a little closer to the coast by Tuesday before veering back out to sea on Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Mexican authorities rushed to deploy emergency crews and said they were considering ordering evacuations of low-lying areas. Flooded: A man drives his motorcycle through a street flooded by rain brought by Hurricane Raymond in Acapulco on Monday. Schools have been closed and emergency crews have been called in . More to come: A resident walks through a street flooded by rain brought in Acapulco on Monday . About 10,000 people are already living away from their homes a month after Manuel inundated whole neighborhoods and caused landslides that buried much of one village. It left behind drenched hillsides that posed serious landslide risks. David Korenfeld, head of Mexico's National Water Commission, said officials were pinning their hopes on a cold front moving from the north that could help steer Raymond away from the coast. 'The cold front coming down is what makes it (Raymond) turn to the left, but that is a model,' Korenfeld said. 'If that cold front comes down more slowly, this tropical storm... can get closer to the coast.' Forecasters said that even if Raymond stays offshore, the storm could dump heavy rain and cause deadly flooding. 'There will be rain for the next 72 hours along the Pacific coast - very heavy rain, torrential rain,' Korenfeld said. Heading for the coast: An image provided by NOAA shows Hurricane Raymond heading for Mexico Monday . Intense: A satellite image provided by NOAA shows Hurricane Raymond in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Mexico as it strengthened to a Category 3 storm early on Monday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:50 EST, 21 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:50 EST, 21 October 2013 . The last piece of legislation President John F. Kennedy signed  - aiming to transform the way people with mental health problems were cared for - turns 50 this month. But the dream behind the Community Mental Health Act -  to build 1,500 centres, halving the number of those living in state mental hospitals - was never realised. Signed on October 31, 1963, weeks before Kennedy was assassinated, the legislation aimed to build mental health centres accessible to all Americans so that those with mental illnesses could be treated while working and living at home, rather than being kept in neglectful and often abusive state institutions, sometimes for years on end. President John F. Kennedy signs a bill authorizing $329 million for mental health programs at the White House in Washington. The Community Mental Health Act, the last legislation that Kennedy signed, aimed to build 1,500 mental health centres . Kennedy said when he signed the bill that the legislation to build 1,500 centres would mean the population of those living in state mental hospitals — at that time more than 500,000 people — could be cut in half. The . legislation did help to usher in positive life-altering changes for . people with serious illnesses such as schizophrenia, many of whom now . live normal, productive lives with jobs and families. In 1963, the . average stay in a state institution for someone with schizophrenia was . 11 years. But only half of the proposed centres were ever built, and those were never fully funded. Meanwhile, . about 90 percent of beds have been cut at state hospitals, according to . Paul Appelbaum, a Columbia University psychiatry professor and expert . in how the law affects the practice of medicine. In many cases, several mental health experts said, that has left . nowhere for the sickest people to turn, so they end up homeless, abusing . substances or in prison, the Associated Press reports. In a special message to Congress earlier that year, he said the idea was to successfully and quickly treat patients in their own communities and then return them to 'a useful place in society.' Recent deadly mass shootings, including at the Washington Navy Yard and a Colorado movie theatre, have been perpetrated by men who were apparently not being adequately treated for serious mental illnesses. But only half of the proposed centres were ever built, and those were never fully funded . Those tragedies have focused public attention on the mental health system and made clear that Kennedy’s vision was never fully realised. The three largest mental health providers in the nation today are jails: Cook County in Illinois, Los Angeles County and Rikers Island in New York. 'The rhetoric was very highfalutin. The reality was a little more complicated, and the funds that were provided were not adequate to the task,' said Steven Sharfstein, president and CEO of Sheppard Pratt Health System, a nonprofit behavioral health organisation in Baltimore. 'The goals of deinstitutionalization were perverted. People who did need institutional care got thrown out, and there weren’t the programs in place to keep them supported,' said former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy, the president’s nephew. 'We don’t have an alternate policy to address the needs of the severely mentally ill.' He is gathering advocates in Boston this week for the Kennedy Forum, a meeting to mark the 50th anniversary of his uncle’s legislation and an attempt to come up with an agenda for improving mental health care. The 1963 legislation came amid other changes in treatments for the mentally ill and health care policy in general, Appelbaum said. Chlorpromazine or Thorazine, the first effective antipsychotic medicine, was released in the 1950s. That allowed many people who were mentally ill to leave institutions and live at home. In 1965, with the adoption of Medicaid, the government program that provided health care coverage for the poor, deinstitutionalization accelerated, experts said, because states now had an incentive to move patients out of state hospitals, where they shouldered the entire cost of their care, and into communities where the federal government would pick up part of the tab. Later, a movement grew to guarantee rights to people with mental illness. Laws were changed in every state to limit involuntary hospitalisation so people can’t be committed without their consent, unless there is a danger of hurting themselves or others. Kennedy’s legislation provided for $329 million to build mental health centers that were supposed to provide services to people who had formerly been in institutions, as well as to reach into communities to try to prevent the occurrence of new mental disorders. Had the act been fully implemented, there would have been a single place in every community for people to go for mental health services. But one problem with the legislation was that it didn’t provide money to operate the centers long-term. 'Having gotten them off the ground, the federal government left it to states and localities to support,' Appelbaum said. 'That support by and large never came through.' Later, during the Reagan administration, the remaining funding for the act was converted into a mental health block grant for states, allowing them to spend it however they chose. Appelbaum called it a death knell because it left the community health centers that did exist on their own for funding. Robert Drake, a professor of psychiatry and community and family medicine at Dartmouth College, said some states have tried to provide good community mental health care. 'But it’s been very hard for them to sustain that because when state budget crunches come, it’s always easiest to defund mental health programs because the state legislature gets relatively little pushback,' he said. The three largest mental health providers in the nation today are jails: Cook County in Illinois, Los Angeles County and Rikers Island in New York (pictured) 'Services are at a very low level right now. It’s really kind of a disaster situation in most states.' Sharfstein points out that most mentally ill people are at a very low risk of becoming violent. He said it’s unthinkable we would go back to the era when people were housed in 'nightmare' conditions at overcrowded, understaffed and sometimes dangerous state hospitals. 'The opportunity to recover is much greater now than it was in 1963,' he said. But for those who do not take their medication, don’t recover from their first episode of illness and don’t seek treatment and support from professionals, they are vulnerable to homelessness, incarceration and death, he said. Linda Rosenberg, president and CEO of the National Council for Behavioral Health, counts among its 2,100 member organizations many of the original community mental health centers that were built under the 1963 legislation. 'Whenever you pass a piece of legislation, people would like to think that you’ve solved the problem,' she said. 'It did some very important things. It laid some ground work. It’s up to us now to move forward.'","Community Mental Health Act was designed to build 1,500 centres .

A fighter pilot was forced to turn on his weapon system in a desperate bid to locate a passing passenger plane during a near-miss incident. The F15-E jet passed just 1,200ft from the Eastern Airlines Jetstream JS41 passenger plane which was had 28 passengers and three crew on-board. The fighter pilot was conducting a 'rapid climb' at 379knots (436mph) from a low level when he was alerted to the presence of an aircraft nearby on May 16, this year. After frantically scanning the skies . from his cockpit, the fighter pilot was unable to spot the other . aircraft and switched on the gun radar to locate it. His attempt failed, but luckily the civilian plane, travelling from Aberdeen to Humberside, was already behind him. The UK Airprox Board labelled the miss as ‘Class B’ which means the safety of the two planes were compromised. In . his comments, the JS41 pilot said he thought the risk of collision was . 'medium' although the fighter pilot claimed it was 'low' - this is . despite neither pilot being able to see the other’s plane.

'immediately switched the radar from its ""search"" mode to ""guns"" mode, a . move which still failed to reveal the JS41, probably because it was . already behind him'. The . Airprox Board concluded the cause of the near-miss was due to the F15 . pilot climbing 'into conflict with the JS41, which he did not see'.

Female MPs are well used to scrutiny over their appearance - whether it be Theresa May's choice of footwear or Louise Mensch's facelift. But it seems women are not the only ones turning for style and beauty help, as the number of 'male peacock' politicians is on the rise. Westminster men are increasingly turning to make-up artists for help under the unforgiving studio lights and using professional trainers to try and avoid negative headlines about their waistlines, say insiders. Sky News political correspondent Sophy Ridge says David Cameron backcombs his hair to hide his bald spot . The Prime Minister is one of a number of 'male peacock' politicians who turn to professionals to make them look better. He is pictured working out with celebrity trainer Matt Roberts . Sky News political correspondent Sophy Ridge says grooming among male politicians is 'the fastest trend in Westminster'. It comes after reports that David Cameron is worried about his bald patch and Nick Clegg is concerned with his paunch. Opposition MPs are also said to be more conscious of their looks and Ed Miliband has faced accusations of covering up his grey hair. Ms Ridge said rolling 24-hour news, HD cameras and bright studio lights is fuelling the trend. She claims the best politicians' aides regularly use make-up to hide the shine on television. On the Telegraph website, she wrote: 'Now even the most macho of male politicos, from Ed Balls to trade union leaders, aren’t brave enough to face the cameras without at least a slick of anti-shine.' Nick Clegg allegedly installed a running machine in the Cabinet Office after negative headlines about his paunch . Mr Clegg, pictured with wife Miriam, looked far more trim at the Liberal Democrats Party Conference last month . The Prime Minister also debuted his new glasses last month. Mr Cameron's wife Samantha is believed to have helped him pick out the rimless style, which have drawn comparisons to the ones worn by Tony Blair. Mr Cameron has previously generated headlines - and raised eyebrows - with his intense workouts with Naomi Campbell's personal trainer. The Prime Minister has regularly undertaken gruelling training sessions with Matt Roberts, who has also helped keep Amanda Holden in shape. However hiding a bald patch is harder than battling the bulge. The Prime Minister has taken to growing his hair long or backcombing to try and mask the bald spot, according to Ms Ridge. Weight is also said to be an issue for Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. In May, he cut a fuller figure as he . appeared to be losing the battle with his middle-aged spread, but after a . raft of negative headlines, he was noticeably slimmer at the Liberal . Democrat Party conference. Ms Ridge said Michael Gove is the 'extreme example' of a male peacock. The education secretary (pictured left in 2012 and right at the Conservative Party Conference last month) spent £2,500 a week at an Austrian fat farm . Ms Ridge said Mr Clegg installed a running machine for the Cabinet Office in a bid to stay trim. However, Michael Gove wins the award for the most 'extreme' example of a male peacock, Ms Ridge says. In September, the Mail on Sunday reported the Education Secretary paid £2,500 a week to lose 2st at an Austrian 'fat farm'. There have been rumours that Mr Gove's motivation was his desire to mount a leadership challenge when Mr Cameron eventually steps down. However, Mr Gove dismissed the speculation, saying he is 'too ugly'. Ms Ridge said far from being a problem, more focus on the appearance of politicians is 'common sense'. She wrote that politicians 'have to play the game' and if MPs are too shiny or wearing appalling clothes then voters are too distracted by their appearance to listen to what they have to say.","Westminster's 'male peacocks' are on the rise, according to Sophy Ridge .

A patient has died on the way to hospital in a police car because there were not enough ambulances to take them. The death of the unnamed person lead to four officers being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The incident is part of a growing trend of vulnerable patients being taken to A&E by police officers because of a shortage of ambulances. Logs kept by Police Federation officials reveal that vulnerable and severely ill patients are being taken to hospital in police cars after ambulances failed to arrive. Four officers were investigated by the IPCC after a woman died while being transported . In another case a 14-year-old girl who had overdosed on diazepam had to be taken to hospital by officers after her parents waited 80 minutes for an ambulance. Police cars were also used to transport a father who had slit his wrists and was bleeding heavily and a woman who had crashed her car and was having heart palpitations, both in the East of England. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham has criticised Jeremy Hunt for failing to address the crisis . In another case in the South East an officer was disciplined after taking a very sick woman to hospital after no ambulance was available nearby. The police control room had told the officer not to take the patient, who died but was later revived, and disciplined the officer for misconduct. The full scale of the crisis has been revealed in incident logs kept by Police Federation officials. One, in the North East, wrote that 'during a shift of 16 officers, eight were in hospital standing by for around four hours.' In another statement the official added: 'On Good Friday we were told there is a seven hour waiting time for an ambulance - so don't call one... you won't get one.' The scandal was uncovered by a Labour probe and shadow Health Secretary Andy Burham blamed Jeremy Hunt for the problems, telling The Observer : 'He has failed to grasp the urgency of the A&E crisis. The chaos is now spreading to other emergency services. 'The alarming fact that police cars are now doubling as makeshift ambulances is a clear sign of how bad things have got on his watch.' The rising use of police cars being used to take patients to hospital is in part due to the much-criticised 111 phone service leading to more patients calling 999 for help. The use of police vehicles has been blamed on the shambolic 111 phone service leading to more people calling 999, and more patients walking into A&E to be treated leading to ambulances waiting for doctors to be free . As more desperate patients preset themselves at casualty wards for treatment the ambulances which are available are waiting longer for doctors to become free. Steve White, Vice-Chairman Police Federation for England and Wales, said: 'Police officers routinely find themselves dealing with medical emergencies, and are placed in positions where they are left with no option but to use police vehicles as makeshift ambulances. 'They are dealing with a variety of casualties, from assault victims to those involved in traffic collisions, and often find themselves waiting for an hour or longer for paramedics to arrive.' Government cuts to NHS Trusts have also placed a bigger strain upon the ambulance service. Earlier this year it was reported that the number of patients forced to wait at least two hours parked outside A&E had risen by two-thirds in one year. Figures from eight of England's 10 ambulance trusts also showed that 3,424 patients waited more than two hours before handover to hospital staff during 2012-13, compared with 2,061 such patients the year before.","Vulnerable and badly injured patients being taken to hospital in police cars .

Drinking a glass of grapefruit juice a day could dramatically increase the effectiveness of cancer drugs, according to a study. Patients who combined the fruit with a specific anti-cancer drug received the same benefits as they would have from taking more than three times of the medication by itself. Researchers from the University of Chicago Medicine said the combination could help patients avoid side effects associated with high doses of the drug and reduce the cost of the medication. Grapefruit affects the enzymes in the intestine, preventing them from breaking down certain medications . Grapefruit juice is known to prevent enzymes in the intestine that break down certain drugs, meaning more can enter the blood stream. This means doctors often tell patients to avoid the fruit when taking particular medications as it can cause serious side-effects or overdose. Scientists now wanted to see if they could harness this effect. Study leader Dr Ezra Cohen said: 'Grapefruit juice, and drugs with a . similar mechanism, can significantly increase blood levels of many . drugs. 'But this has long been considered an . overdose hazard. Instead, we wanted to see if grapefruit juice can be . used in a controlled fashion to increase the availability and efficacy . of sirolimus.' Sirolimus or rapamycin is used to prevent rejection in organ transplantation but is also being tested as a treatment for certain tumours. In a study published in Clinical Cancer Research, the Chicago team showed that patients who drank eight ounces of grapefruit a day increased their sirolimus levels by 350 per cent. Certain substances in grapefruit juice are known to stop an enzyme in the small intestine from breaking down some medications. This allows more of the drug to enter the blood stream and could cause serious side-effects or accidental overdose. Seville oranges affect the same enzyme. While most drugs to not interact there are around 50 that do. The affected drugs include some used to treat high cholesterol such as statins, some medications for high blood pressure, depression, pain, erectile dysfunction, HIV and allergies. Always check the medication bottle for potential interactions and check with your GP or pharmacist if you are uncertain. For more information visit . A drug called ketoconazole that also slows drug metabolism increased sirolimus levels by 500 percent. The effect of grapefruit on the enzymes in the intestine begins within a . few hours of consumption and gradually wears off over a few days. Dr Cohen and colleagues organized three . simultaneous phase-1 trials of sirolimus. Patients received only . sirolimus, sirolimus plus ketoconazole, or sirolimus plus grapefruit . juice. They enrolled 138 patients with incurable cancer and no known . effective therapy. The first patients started with very . low sirolimus doses, but the amounts increased as the study went on, to . see how much of the drug was required in each setting to reach targeted . levels, so that patients got the greatest anti-cancer effect with the . least side effects. The optimal cancer-fighting dose for . those taking sirolimus was about 90 mg per week. At doses above 45 mg, . however, the drug caused serious gastrointestinal problems, such as . nausea and diarrhea, so patients taking sirolimus alone switched to 45 . mg twice a week. The optimal doses for the other two . groups were much lower. Patients taking sirolimus plus ketoconazole, . needed only 16 mg per week to maintain the same levels of drug in the . blood. Those taking sirolimus plus grapefruit juice, needed between 25 . and 35 mg of sirolimus per week. No patients in the study had a . complete response, but about 30 percent of patients in the three trials . had stable disease, meaning a period when their cancers did not advance. One patient receiving grapefruit juice had a partial . response - significant tumor shrinkage - that lasted for more than three . years.

The last friend to see British schoolteacher Lauren Patterson alive has spoken of her guilt at allowing her to get in a car with the men suspected of her murder. Beautician Lea Monet had spent the evening with Lauren in a nightclub in Doha, Qatar, and the pair agreed to the offer of a lift home from two men they had been drinking with. Miss Monet, 22, reluctantly got out of the car at her apartment, leaving  Miss Patterson with the men as the teacher insisted she was in  safe hands. 'Excited to be back': Lauren Patterson, right, was clubbing with best friend Lea Monet, left, before she was killed . One of the men later sent a text message to Miss Monet, saying her friend was ‘all good’ – but hours later Lauren’s charred remains were discovered dumped in the desert. It is believed the 24-year-old was stabbed to death at the home of one of the men. Her body was later burned beyond recognition. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of murder and are expected to face the death penalty if convicted under sharia law. Miss Monet, who is originally from France, described how last Saturday’s events unfolded after Miss Patterson, from Kent, returned to Qatar where she worked at the Newton British School in Doha. She said: ‘After I had finished work on the Friday I went and picked Lauren up from Doha airport as she had been at her grandmother’s funeral in England. ‘We went back to her apartment and got changed to go out to a nightclub. She was really excited to be back and her boyfriend was due to fly out and see her the following week, so she was very happy. Staying until Justice is done: Lauren's mother Alison (right), pictured here with her daughter, has flown out to Doha while police investigations continue . ‘We were listening to music and having some drinks before getting a taxi to Club 7, our favourite nightclub where we went every week. ‘Lauren was in a fantastic mood – she was singing, dancing and catching up with all her friends. There were a group of men who we knew on the table next to us and they kept coming over to our table and giving us drinks.’ The women, who became best friends after meeting in March through mutual friends on Doha’s clubbing scene, left the nightclub at about 1am last Saturday with two of the men from the group. Miss Monet said: ‘Lauren and I wanted to go home and went to get a taxi but one of the men, a tall black man, was being overly friendly and kept trying to put his arm around Lauren. 'Qatar is a very conservative country and I started shouting at him to stop it. We started walking away to a taxi but he called to us, “Why don’t you get in my car and I’ll give you a lift home?” ‘I said OK because we knew him. We used to see him and his mate each week at the nightclub.’ Miss Monet revealed that the pair asked the two men to be taken to Lauren’s apartment in the Gulf city. But they stopped at Miss Monet’s apartment first and she got out. ‘Lauren said she would be fine and the three of them drove off,’ she said. ‘It is a decision I will regret for the rest of my life.’ Settled: Lauren, pictured here with boyfriend James Grima, had many friends in Qatar . Miss Monet texted the driver, whose name she does not want to reveal, asking if her friend had got home safely and he replied ‘Lauren is all good.’ But the next afternoon she still had not heard from her. Miss Monet met the driver next day to ask for an explanation and, noticing a cut on his lip, became suspicious and went to the police. She said: ‘The next day they told me they had found Lauren’s remains in the desert. ‘When I heard, it was the worst feeling in the world. I can’t help but feel that I could have done something to stop it happening. ‘Part of me is still scared that friends of the men will come for me but I want to tell the world the truth about what happened.’ The alleged suspects are thought to have dug a pit in the desert which they filled with charcoal before pouring petrol on Lauren’s body and setting it alight and fleeing. Due to the remoteness of the location, it is unlikely her remains would have been discovered  but for a local falconer who was in the area. His bird of prey was attracted to the burning corpse and led him to it. The falconer is understood to have alerted police, who hid in the sand dunes and pounced on a man when he appeared at the scene checking on the fire. A Doha police source revealed that Miss Patterson’s body was so badly burned that it was reduced to ashes apart from a piece of her skull and her feet. Favourite: Lauren enjoyed an evening at Club 7, pictured, before she was killed . Police are expecting to make more arrests in connection with Miss Patterson’s murder and said the net was closing on their suspects. Forensics have not been able to ascertain whether Miss Patterson was sexually assaulted or raped and a knife believed to have been the one used to kill her was found in the remains of the fire. A mouth brace worn by Miss Patterson is also thought to have survived the blaze. Because her body was badly burnt it has yet to be officially identified. Miss Patterson’s boyfriend James Grima, an IT technician and DJ, was too upset to speak this week at the home in Malta he shares with twin brother Justin. Miss Patterson’s mother, Alison, a reflexologist from Kent, has travelled to Doha. She said: ‘Lauren had made so many friends. She loved travel and loved teaching, so this was the perfect job for her. ‘She recently had a job offer from another school in Hong Kong but turned it down because she liked it so much in Doha. ‘I will be staying in Doha for as long as it takes to see that justice is done for my daughter.’","Lauren's burned body was found in the desert near Doha, Qatar, last week .

An FBI agent told a jury Monday about the 2008 arrest of Bernard Madoff as the government began presenting evidence to try to prove that five of his former employees helped him carry out his multibillion-dollar fraud. Agent Theodore Cacioppi said he was watching television at home on the evening of Dec. 10, 2008, when a supervisor contacted him saying Madoff 'might be running the biggest Ponzi scheme in history.' He said he and three other agents went to Madoff's Manhattan apartment the next morning and interviewed him for an hour before arresting him. Madoff, 75, is serving a 150-year prison sentence after pleading guilty in 2009 to fraud charges. Now behind bars: Bernard Madoff leaving federal court during his 2010 trial . Cacioppi was the author of the criminal complaint that was initially used to prosecute Madoff and to secure court orders to seize his businesses and assets. In the complaint, he had written that Madoff acknowledged he was ""broke"" and ""insolvent"" and that he had decided it 'could not go on' and he expected to go to jail. 'After I stated, `We're here to find out if there's an innocent explanation,' Madoff stated, `There is no innocent explanation,' the agent wrote. Cacioppi was the first witness at a trial that is expected to last several months. In opening statements last week, defense lawyers said their clients could not have been expected to know what Madoff was up to when the former Nasdaq chairman managed to dupe federal regulators, sophisticated financial professionals and investors. Cacioppi said he visited Madoff's midtown offices after arresting him, finding other agents already gathering evidence to show how Madoff managed to squander nearly $20 billion entrusted to him over more than four decades by thousands of investors, including close friends, charities, financial institutions and celebrities such as filmmaker Steven Spielberg and actor Kevin Bacon. Booked: Bernie Madoff's mugshot taken just after his 2008 arrest . Several photographs introduced with Cacioppi on the witness stand captured what Madoff's offices looked like at the time of his arrest. A picture of the 17th floor offices of the private investment business where prosecutors say the fraud flourished included a snowman with a red scarf and gloves. A Santa Claus, candy canes and an empty stocking were on the walls. Prosecutors used the trial's second witness, a 15-year Madoff employee who lost her job when the company closed in 2009, to introduce records that they say demonstrate how Madoff's workers lived large even as the company's days were numbered. Financial records displayed for the jury demonstrated that one defendant, account manager JoAnn Crupi, spent thousands of dollars at a time on trips to Las Vegas and a wine store. A lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission has said that from 2004 through 2008 Crupi accumulated $270,000 in expenses on the firm's credit card for which she never reimbursed the company.The government said she also wired $2.25 million from the firm's main account to an outside account in late 2008 so she could purchase a beach house in New Jersey. Others on trial are Madoff's longtime secretary, Annette Bongiorno, former director-of-operations Daniel Bonventre, and computer programmers Jerome O'Hara and George Perez. All have pleaded not guilty.","Bernie Madoff, 75, ran the biggest Ponzi scheme in United States history .

A British man has died Cyprus in front of his fiancee while trying to save a pensioner from drowning. Keith West, 50, was walking along a promenade on the first day of his holiday in Cyprus, when he spotted an elderly man in difficulty in the sea and ran to his aid. Mr West, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, managed to pull the old man to dry land but lost his own footing in a strong undercurrent, and was dragged beneath the water, disappearing from sight. Keith West, pictured with his fiancee Julie Davies, drowned while trying to help save a pensioner in difficulty . Mr West pulled the pensioner to land but lost his footing in a strong undercurrent and was dragged beneath the water . A lifeguard who was helping with the rescue effort on the beach risked his own life to enter the water - but it was ten minutes before Keith was found and brought to the surface. Keith's fiancee Julie Davies witnessed the tragedy unfold. Mr West's family described him as a hero who carried out life-saving lessons when he was younger . The couple were planning to get married on the Greek island next year, and had travelled there to look for venues for their wedding ceremony and reception. Ms Davies has now been joined by some of Mr West's devastated brothers and sisters, who have flown to Cyprus to help make arrangements for him to be brought home. Floral tributes have been laid on the beach where Mr West, an electrician known as Tufty, lost his life. Speaking on behalf of the family, brother-in-law Garry Fisher, 56, said the death had shattered the family. 'Keith died a hero. It is such a waste of a good man's life and all in the space of a few seconds,' Mr Fisher said, who is married to Keith's sister Yvonne. 'Nobody can believe it - Keith was such a strong swimmer, he did lifesaving badges when he was younger. 'Keith and Julie were walking along the promenade when they saw an elderly couple in difficulty in the water and could hear the woman shouting 'help'. 'They rushed down to the sea and where the man was, and it was only knee high, but there must have been a strong under current because he couldn't get out. 'Keith went in and managed to pass him over to a lifeguard, but then the undercurrent took hold of him and he went under.

'Keith died a hero and we are all very proud of what he did, trying to save someone's life, but we are just devastated at what happened to him. 'He was an absolutely brilliant man with a dry sense of humour. He will be badly missed.' His sister Paula Robjohns, 41, also hailed her brother a hero. 'All he would have been thinking is that he needed to help,' she said.","Keith West and fiancee Julie Davies spotted an elderly couple in difficulties .

The process of labour and delivery usually looms large in a pregnant woman's thoughts, with extensive birthing plans and preparation very much the norm. But in a story sure to terrify expectant mothers everywhere, a mother-of-two delivered her own baby in breakneck speed - whilst she was sitting on her toilet. In just thirty minutes, Charlie Francis-Pape, 27, from Bridport, Dorset, delivered her baby girl after rushing to the bathroom thinking she needed the loo. Charlie Francis-Pape with her husband Jinder Dewhurst-Pape and their new daughter Winter at home . Write caption here . Although she had been in some discomfort for about 20 minutes, but she assumed she would have hours of labour and so did not rush to action. Once on the toilet the English teacher felt a sudden need to push, and her baby fell into her arms just seconds later. Charlie said: 'I'd been in pain for about twenty minutes. 'But all of a sudden I felt like I needed the toilet. I staggered to the loo, sat down, and before I knew it I could see the baby's head. Whilst baby Winter Ami survived her dramatic delivery unscathed, mum Charlie had to be rushed to hospital after haemorrhaging . 'I lifted myself off the seat and . just caught her as she came out. It all happened so quickly, I don't . think I even realised what had happened until afterwards. 'I suppose it's quite funny that I gave birth on the loo - but at the time it was the best place for it.' Whilst . baby Winter Ami survived her dramatic delivery unscathed, mother . Charlie had to be rushed to hospital after haemorrhaging. The couple had carefully planned a hypno birth for Winter (right) after Charlie had a bad birthing experience with her first daughter (pictured left with the family) Luckily, both mum and baby have now recovered from Winter's exciting start to life. Charlie said: 'It's only now that I look back on it all and realise that it was quite exciting. 'At the time I was just following my instincts. 'The funny thing is my eldest daughter Devon, whose bedroom is next to the toilet, slept through the whole thing.' The mum of two had planned on having a relaxing hypnobirth, after suffering a painful 21 hour labour with her eldest daughter. Baby Winter who was born in a incredibly fast thirty minutes, seemed undisturbed by her rather dramatic arrival . Charlie said: 'My husband and I spent . a lot of time and money on hypnobirthing. You use lots of relaxation . techniques and massage, and the idea is that you associate labour with . something positive. 'We wanted to have the baby at home, so had a birthing pool set up in the living room. 'We just expected it to go very smoothly.' However, Charlie's plans were scuppered when she woke up during the night in pain. 'We just expected it to go very smoothly' Charlie admits . Charlie said: 'Devon had woken me up . in the night. I went to comfort her and was just settling myself back . into bed when my waters broke. 'I was astonished because the baby was one week overdue and I just never thought it would happen. 'In the time it took for me to walk downstairs to call my husband - who was at work - the pain had really started. 'But I just lit some candles and put on some relaxing music - I wasn't expecting to meet my daughter for a long time yet.' But whilst Charlie was expecting a slow birth, her baby had other plans. Charlie said: 'Ten minutes later my husband came home and by this point I was getting quite concerned so I asked him to call the midwife. 'But just five minutes later I felt the urge to go to the toilet. 'I staggered across to the landing, sat on the toilet, and before I knew it I'd delivered my baby. 'When she was born I just followed my instincts. I pulled her onto my chest and gave her a rub to get her breathing. 'My husband was still on the phone to the midwife, when the baby came out all pink and wriggling around, so I knew she was ok.' In fact, it was mum Charlie that took a turn for the worse, and was rushed to Dorchester Hospital after haemorrhaging from her womb.

A Brooklyn building owner has hired security guards and installed a metal gate to protect a work by the elusive British graffiti artist Banksy. The rolling gate went up Friday over a wall in the Williamsburg neighborhood where Banksy spray-painted two geishas strolling over a 'bridge' formed by a basement window arch and a bonsai tree spread beneath them. The security measures were taken after a rogue tagger spray-painted over the work and was tackled to the ground by the crowd. Installation: The owners of the building have installed plexiglass and a roller-door to protect the Banksy stencil on their wall . Opening hours: The owners are exercising some crowd control for the hoards who have gathered outside the south Williamsburg building to view the Banksy piece . Others undertook damage control, removing the offending black scribble with rubbing alcohol. Cara Tabachnick, whose family owns the building, write in New York Magazine that her father sent her a text on Thursday morning saying, 'Banksy painted our building last night and a huge crowd is forming. What should we do?' It's not a question to be taken lightly. Banksy canvases sell for upwards of $1 million and art-lovers collect his work with feverish zeal. Just an hour after the work was discoverd, the tagger defaced it and friends and neighbors urged the family to take measures to protect the work. Tabachnick says that she and her family realized that they had unwittingly become responsible for a piece of public art. Secure: The piece has drawn crowds of people since it appeared Thursday morning . Under guard: Feliciano Perez guards the work by British graffiti artist Banksy today in the Brooklyn borough of New York . Tagged: The work was up for less than an hour before a tagger, seen here in a purple scarf, spray painted over it. Two bystanders tried to stop the vandal . Japanese themed: The work uses a brick window archway on the side of a building in Williamsburgh, Brooklyn, to stand in for a bridge . Thwarted: The building superintendent is seen here throwing the tagger to the ground. He called police, but the rival graffiti artist escaped . By late Thursday morning, word had spread and more than 500 people had gathered to view the stencil. The family hired a security guard to stand watch over the artwork, and several more to cover the night shift. Police . and local councilmen weren't interested in helping the family protect . their new acquisition, so they took matters into their own hands. 'We . still haven’t 100 per cent decided what to do,' Tabachnick told the . New York Post . 'But we do have the instinct - and are trying - to preserve it for . the public so it can be viewed and enjoyed, and not destroyed in any . way.' Although the work is . apparently being preserved for the viewing public, new pictures show the . family has imposed some opening and closing hours. Photos . posted to an Instagram account show a sign over the roller door (which . covers a sheet of protective plexiglass) informing people that the door . will come up for viewing at 3pm. Banksy . has caused quite a stir in the Big Apple, where he's undertaking a . monthlong 'residency.' New Yorkers wake every morning to discover a new . work adorning some corner of the city. Defacing street art: The tagger who scrawled over Banksy's work was tackled to the ground by a crowd who had gathered to see the piece . Other . building owners have also been quick to preserve what could be a big . money-spinner, or less cynically, a piece of art for public enjoyment. A . small stencil of the Twin Towers in TriBeCa was covered in plexiglass . and another Banksy of a heart-shaped balloon is under guard and welded . steel. Mayor Michael . Bloomberg said last week that graffiti ruins property and is 'a sign of . decay,' but  said the NYPD is not actively searching for the artful . artist. In . the 19 days since Bansky came to New York City for a so-called . residency, fans of his work have had to race against taggers, who are . intent on covering it with their own marks. Some . of the taggers see Banksy as an interloper intruding on their turf, while some see him as a sell-out. Still others get a thrill out of putting their own mark on work by such a . famous artist.","Banksy spray-painted an artwork on the side of a building in Williamsburg on Wednesday night .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 09:34 EST, 21 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:37 EST, 21 October 2013 . Plans to curb parliament’s  expenses for food, travel and hotels have been condemned by MPs. A £15 allowance for MPs to eat dinner is set to be scrapped as part of a package of cuts which also include a ban on taking taxis before 11pm. But MPs on the Standards Committee have voiced concerns about the plans, claiming they are being stripped of the right to put in for expenses that most private sector companies would pay out for. Complaints: MPs are unhappy at plans to curb allowances for dinner, taxis and hotels . The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) says it wants to put the expenses system that applies to MPs on a footing with other professions. But the Standards Committee claims it is unfair to end the £15 allowance which MPs can claim if the House of Commons sits after 7.30pm. The committee said it had ‘no wish to return to the system in which Members were allowed to make blanket claims’ but said payments for food are commonly given to workers on business away from home. In a report the MPs said: 'If such expenses are not met by the employer, then the employee is able to claim tax relief on subsistence costs of travel between work places.  The rules for MPs are already considerably less generous than this. ‘We also note that when there is whipped business, Members must be within easy reach of the division lobbies. ‘Once again, we consider there needs to be a stronger evidence base before it can be asserted that these are costs which other professionals would expect to meet for themselves, unless they had been dealt with through a salary supplement rather than expenses.’ Fares: Under the rules new MPs would only be allowed to claim for taxis after 11pm . The latest complaints about MPs pay and perks comes amid reports that Ipsa's plans to give MPs an 11 salary rise will be signed off within weeks. All three main party leaders have condemned the idea of a hike at a time when the rest of the country is suffering austerity. The organisation said the £4.6 million extra salary costs would be offset by restrictions to pensions, ‘golden goodbyes’, and expenses - meaning the overall burden on the taxpayer would only go up by £500,000 when the deal took effect after the 2015 general election. Among the changes planned to allowances are a halt to claims for tea and biscuits and ban on using taxis to get home before 11pm. Salary: Sir Ian Kennedy, Chairman of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, has recommended increasing MPs' pay to £74,000 . Hotels would only be allowable if they are booked after 1am and there would also be a crackdown on claims for running two homes, with some costs for TV licences and contents insurance no longer being met. The Standards Committee said it was ‘surprised by the suggestion’ that some of the costs identified are of a kind which workers in other professional jobs would expect to pay for themselves. It said MPs routinely worked 60 or 70 hours a week but since the new system of allowances had been introduced in the wake of the expenses scandal some had taken to sleeping in their offices. ‘We do not consider that Ipsa has made a case for changing the boundary of the existing scheme of business costs and expenses,’ the report said. ‘The proposal to allow taxis to be claimable only after 11pm and hotels to be bookable only after 1am will have the greatest impact on Members for constituencies within the Greater London area, although the proposals for taxis may affect MPs with accommodation within the inner London area, but some distance from Westminster. ‘We find it hard to believe that employers in other sectors would expect their employees to wait until 1am before booking a hotel if it was necessary for them to work beyond the point at which it was possible or sensible to return home and to travel to work in time to start as normal in the morning.’ While MPs' pay is set to go up from £66,396 to £74,000, the existing final salary pension scheme is to be downgraded to career average - as happened across the rest of the public sector some years ago – saving £2.5 million in the first year. Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman said: ‘MPs' pay is a matter for Ipsa. The Prime Minister's view is that the cost of politics should go down not up.’","Expenses watchdog also wants to stop MPs claiming for hotels before 1am .

A dedicated ambulance volunteer sacked for breaking the speed limit during an emergency call-out has been given a reprieve after an 'overwhelming response' from shocked members of the public. Godfrey Smith lost his post as a 'first responder' after ambulance bosses examined his sat-nav and discovered that he had driven at 33mph in a 20mph zone while on his way to save a man's life. News of Mr Smith's dismissal provoked an outcry from shocked members of his community, with hundreds signing petitions demanding that he be reinstated. Reprieve: Volunteer ambulance driver Godfrey Smith has been given a second chance after he was sacked for speeding on an emergency call-out in Oxford . Rethink: Mr Smith, 64, will be allowed to return to his role as a driver as long as he passes a reassessment . The decision has now been overturned, with 64-year-old Mr Smith being told that he will instead undergo retraining, which will pave the way for him to return to his unpaid role. Mr Smith has expressed his joy at being offered his second chance, and said he can not wait to get back to the role, as long as he passes his retest. Although Mr Smith, who had volunteered for the service for 15 years . before he was dismissed in July, drove a marked ambulance, as a first . responder he did not have the same rights to break road laws as . fully-fledged ambulance drivers. Accepting that he had made an error in driving his ambulance Land Rover too fast he has called on bosses at South Central Ambulance Service to re-educate other volunteer responders so that others do not make the same mistake in breaking the speed limit. 'I've never said I didn't do anything wrong,' Mr Smith told the Sunday Telegraph newspaper. 'It is absolutely right that I should have a retest.' Sadness: Mr Smith had described his sacking in September as 'soul destroying' and said that it left him feeling as though his 'heart had been ripped out' A spokesman for South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust confirmed that Mr Smith would be reassessed. Mr Smith had described his sacking in September as 'soul destroying' and said that it left him feeling as though his 'heart had been ripped out'. He was called by controllers on July 23 and sent to the St Clement’s area of Oxford to give emergency treatment to a man who had collapsed with breathing problems. He jumped into his marked South Central Ambulance Service Land Rover to rush to the address, however, following a complaint, he was dismissed for ‘breaching road traffic law’. Bosses who investigated the incident found data on Mr Smith’s  satellite navigation system which showed he was travelling at 13mph faster than he should have done down a high street. He was also criticised for going to the right of a ‘keep left’ bollard. Dismissal: Although Mr Smith drove a marked ambulance, as a first responder he did not have the same rights to break road laws as fully-fledged ambulance drivers . Support: Members of the public rushed to support Mr Smith after his dismissal, and more than 1,500 people signed a petition calling for his reinstatement . However, Mr Smith said the sat-nav did not pick up that the road was a new 20mph zone and was still showing a 30mph limit, and that he drove around the bollard to get past traffic. He said that had he realised he would not have broken the speed limit. Mr Smith usually served in the area surrounding his home in Faringdon, Oxfordshire, but had agreed to work in the centre of Oxford because the professional crews in the city were overstretched. Members of the public were quick to support Mr Smith after his dismissal, and more than 1,500 people, many of them from Faringdon signed a petition calling for his reinstatement. Mr Smith was told on Wednesday that SCAS had rethought its decision at a meeting with chief executive Will Hancock, who told him that the 'overwhelming response' had been taken into account. In a show of solidarity, Mr Smith's son, performing arts student Matthew, 19, who also worked as a first responder, resigned in support of his father. Mr Smith hopes that after he passes his reassessment the teenager would also return to volunteering. 'I would like to work alongside him again,' he said.","Dedicated Godfrey Smith was sacked for driving 33mph in 20mph zone .

This is something people could see in various parts of the community,’ said Pasco Co. Sheriff's Office spokesperson Melanie Snow. After Curto fell from the plane, the pilot circled the location and then returned to the airfield. ‘We were admiring it and my son just said, “mom, look,” and I looked up and we just saw a man just falling out of the plane,’ Atricia Smith, who lives in road where Curto fell, told the station Fox13. Shocking: Curto's body landed in the backyard of a home on in the Grand Oaks subdivision in Land O Lakes . ‘Instantly I thought about him just being out maybe on some adventure and how shocking this is going to be to his family. One minute it was a happy moment to...what went wrong?’ Melanie Snow, a sheriff's office spokesperson, said this appears to be an accident. ‘We are calling it a fall from the plane because his parachute never even opened,’ she said. ‘But he did have a parachute on him and we believe the intent was to parachute from the plane.’ She said it appears unlikely that a medical condition, such as a heart attack, caused the victim to fall. He landed in a homeowner's backyard on McBrine Court. Neighbors ran over to try to help, but it was too late. It is at least the third fatal skydiving accident in the Tampa Bay area in the past three years. In March, two skydivers from Iceland, instructor Orvar Arnarson, 41, and student, Andrimar Pordarson, 25, died in a jump March 23 at Skydive City in Zephyrhills. Fatal mishap: According to one version of events, Curto was skydiving and after he jumped his parachute failed to open . In that case, for an unknown reason neither man deployed his chute, and emergency chutes deployed too close to the ground to save them. And in 2010, Paul C. Luter III, 68, died after jumping at Skydive City when his parachute apparently malfunctioned. In April of this year, Curto lost his wife of 36 years to breast cancer.

From the New Orleans torture attic that inspired the latest series of American Horror Story to the Iowa cottage that witnessed the shocking unsolved ax murders of several children - welcome to America's six most-haunted houses. A shortlist of the most well-documented properties across the United States that are reportedly possessed by ghosts and other supernatural spirits has been compiled on the back of statistics that nearly one third of Americans claim to have experienced an encounter with the undead. According to the 'Haunted House Report' on Realtor.com, 35 per cent of respondents claim they have lived or are living in a place that is haunted. Known warning signs that a house may be inhabited are said to include having a cemetery on the property, if it is over 100 years old, whether it is close to battlegrounds or crime scenes or any quick transitions between owners, according to CBS. Ed Kushins, a global travel expert, has put together a creepy criteria to determine the country's most ghoulish abodes and their gruesome histories. Some are even available to stay overnight. 1.) LaLaurie Mansion, New Orleans . Now: 1140 Royal Street, New Orleans, is said to be haunted by several slaves who died horrific deaths in a torture chamber at the hands of owner Madame LaLaurie . Built in 1832, this New Orleans manor is reputed to be haunted by several mistreated slaves - a story stemming from a fire in the building in 1834, when neighbors helping to save furniture from the flames reputedly found tortured slaves chained up in the attic by owner Marie Delphine LaLaurie, better known as Madame LaLaurie, a prominent Louisianan socialite and, it would later be discovered, serial killer. Then: LaLaurie Mansion in 1832 . The fire had started in the kitchen and upon entering the home, police found an elderly woman, the cook, chained to the stove from the ankle. According to the New Orleans Bee of April 11, 1834, bystanders found 'seven slaves, more or less horribly mutilated ... suspended by the neck, with their limbs apparently stretched and torn from one extremity to the other', who claimed to have been imprisoned there for some months. Upon hearing this and once the fire was out, an angry mob descended upon the house and all-but completely destroyed it. Actress Kathy Bates plays a character based on LaLaurie in the current season of American Horror Story, Coven. The home, which was rebuilt to resemble the original, was owned by actor Nicholas Cage from 2007 until 2009. Not much is known of LaLaurie's life after the fire. However writer Harriet Martineau documented that LaLaurie fled New Orleans during the mob violence, taking a coach to the waterfront and traveling by schooner from there to Mobile, Alabama and then on to Paris. She is rumored to have died in Paris in a boar-hunting accident. 2.) Villisca Ax Murder House, Iowa . It has been a century since Josiah and Sarah Moore, their four children and two visiting children were hacked to death with an ax while they slept. The tiny town where they lived in Iowa has never been the same . This photo, taken in 2011, shows the bedroom of Herman, 11, Katherine, 9, Boyd, 7, and Paul Moore, 5, at the time of the Villisca ax murders. Investigators believe the killer or killers attacked the parents first before moving to the children . On a quiet residential street in the small Iowa town of Villisca  sits an old white frame house. On a dark evening, the absence of lights and sounds are the first indication to visitors that the house is different from the other homes that surround it. Upon closer inspection,it's doors and windows are tightly closed and covered. An outhouse in the backyard suggests that this house does not occupy a place in the 21st century. That's because on the night of June 10, 1912, the six members of the Moore family who lived here and two other children were killed in what remains the state's worst mass murder. Parents Josiah and Sarah and their four children Herman, 11, Katherine, 10, Boyd, 7, and Paul, 5, as well as two of the Katherine's friends Ina, 8, and Lena, 12, were all found with severe head wounds from an ax. Investigators believed that all of the victims except for Lena Stillinger had been asleep at the time of the murders. Investigators also believed Lena attempted to fight back because a defensive wound was discovered on her arm. Lena was found on the bed with her nightgown pushed up to her waist and no undergarments on, leading to speculation that the killer or killers sexually molested her or attempted to do so. While many suspects emerged, Rev. George Kelly, a traveling minister and suspected pedophile, was twice tried for the murders but was acquitted both times. The case remains unsolved. 3.) Farnsworth House, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania . Used to house soliders during the Battle of Gettysburg during the Civil War, Farmsworth House Inn is now a bed and breakfast that is thought to be crawling in ghosts . The famous Civil War battle at Gettysburg was one of the bloodiest in its four-year history. Farnsworth House, named for Brigadier General Elon J. Farnsworth, was home to Confederate sharpshooters, who would shoot union soliders from the windows during the conflict. It later operated as a makeshift hospital, and currently functions as a nine-room bed and breakfast. Five of those rooms are said to be haunted by the ghosts of fallen soldiers, as well as a midwife called Mary, whom many guests have reportedly seen sitting on their beds at night. 4.) Joshua Ward House, Salem, Massachusetts . Joshua Ward House, 148 Washington Street, Salem. This brick mansion was built for merchant Joshua Ward in the 1780s on a foundation that had previously been owned by Sheriff George Corwin, who became known as 'The Strangler' for his role in the killing of many accused witches during the Salem trials of the 1690s. The spirits of his victims are said to still reside in the house today. Inside: One of the rooms of the haunted Joshua Ward House . Today: Robert Murphy, owner of Higginson Book Company, bought Joshua Ward House in 1994, but it has been vacant for two years . The town of Salem, Massachusetts is no stranger to macabre record and disturbing legends and Joshua Ward House is one of its most prominent. The Georgian/Federal style building was constructed by Joshua Ward, a wealthy merchant sea captain, in the late 1780s on foundations built by notorious former sheriff George Corwin. Corwin was a bloody figure whose zeal added to the unfortunate events surrounding the Salem Witch Trials in the late 1600s. Nicknamed ‘The Strangler’ for his preferred method of torture (which included tying his victims’ necks to their ankles until the blood ran from their noses), he is said to be responsible for death of countless witches. One of them was Giles Corey, a man who stood accused of witchcraft who Corwin crushed to death by placing heavy stones on his chest in order to extract a confession. Before he died, Corey curses the Corwin and all the sheriffs that would follow him. Rumor has it every sheriff since Corey uttered this curse has died while in office or has been ‘forced out of his post as the result of a heart or blood ailment’. Corwin himself died of a heart attack in 1696. Today, many of Corwin's victims, including Corey, are said to live in Joshua Ward House. 5.) Dock Street Theater, Charleston, South Carolina . Then: The building that stands on Charleston's Church Street today is not the original Dock Street Theater, though it is thought to be haunted by some of its original actors, theater-goers and a local prostitute . Now: The theatre recently underwent a three-year, $18 million renovation . The tales of those that haunt the Dock St Theater - on the site of America's first theater - is much different from the serial killer, soldier and witch-type ghosts usually heard.It was originally constructed around 1809 as Planter's Hotel by the Calder It's said that there are two entities that continuously wander around the theater. One of them was a famous actor by the name of Junius Brutus Booth, most famously known as the father of the man who killed President Abraham Lincoln, John Wilkes Booth. The other ghostly creature, a nameless prostitute locals call ""Nettie"" who is believed to have frequented the area also in the 1800's. Nettie worked at the hotel and was struck by lightening standing on her porch.She was killed instantly.The theater recently underwent a three-year, $18 million renovation. 6.) Boone Hall Plantation, Charleston, South Carolina . A former major brickyard in South Carolina, at one time the Boone Hall Plantation used up to 225 slaves to keep up with the demand. The many who died working still roam the land, folklore says . These are the brickyard quarters where the slaves would live . Today: The gorgeous grounds of the Boone Hall Plantation in Charleston, . The Boone Hall Plantation, founded by Major John Boone and then sold to brothers John and Henry Horlbeck, is the final place on the list of America's most haunted houses. And like LaLaurie Mansion, it is said to be inhabited by mistreated slaves. The brothers expanded the property's brickyard and set some of their 225 slaves to work operating dangerous kilns for the local building industry beginning in 1817. According to legend, the numerous spirit sightings at the plantation have all occurred within 20 feet of the kiln, and a slave girl and slave boy are the most commonly spotted.","Almost one third of Americans claim to have been to or have lived in a haunted house, says new poll .

"By . Mark Prigg . PUBLISHED: . 07:10 EST, 3 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:17 EST, 3 May 2013 . One of Britain's leading scientists has hit out at Chinese researchers who created new strains of a killer flu virus in a bid to develop vaccines. They claim the 'hybrid' flu, which mixes bird flu virus with human flu, could escape the lab and lead to a global health crisis pandemic killing millions of people. It comes amid rising fears of a flu epidemic as China struggles to contain an outbreak of the virus. The Bird Flu Virus up close: researchers fear an experimental strain of the killer virus could escape from the Chinese lab that created it . Fears over hybrid flu escaping led to scientists imposing a voluntary moratorium on their H5N1 research, banning transmission studies using ferrets. However, researchers decided to lift the ban earlier this year, arguing that they have now consulted widely with health organisations and the public over safety concerns. However, some scientists still oppose the work, saying any work is too dangerous and experimental strains could escape the lab. Professor Hualan Chen, director of China’s National Avian Influenza . Reference Laboratory at Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, deliberately mixed the H5N1 bird-flu . virus, which is highly lethal but not easily transmitted between people, . with a 2009 strain of H1N1 flu virus, which is very infectious to . humans. The researchers claim the work could help develop a vaccine. 'The work of Zhang and colleagues provides a framework for further studies examining how the structure of the avian flu virus influences how readily it could transition to being a pathogen with human pandemic potential,' Science Express, the journal which published the research, said. The study, which was carried out in a laboratory with the second highest . security level to prevent accidental escape, resulted in 127 different . viral hybrids between H5N1 and H1N1, five of which were able to pass by . airborne transmission between laboratory guinea pigs. However, it is feared the mutated viruses could escape, sparking a global pandemic. 'They claim they are doing this to help develop vaccines and such like,' Lord May of Oxford, a former government chief scientist and past president of the Royal Society, told The Independent. 'In fact the real reason is that they are driven by blind ambition with . no common sense whatsoever, and the record of containment in labs like this is not reassuring. 'They are . taking it upon themselves to create human-to-human transmission of very . dangerous viruses. It’s appallingly irresponsible,' he said. It comes as experts warn human cases of a deadly new strain of bird flu that has killed 27 people in China are likely to crop up in Europe and around the world. Quarantine activities at a bay in Hwaseong City, South Korea. Lord May, a former Government science advisor, warned the 'hybrid' flu, which mixes bird flu virus with human flu, could escape the lab and kill millions . In his first media interview since returning from an international scientific mission to China last week, Professor Angus Nicoll, the head of the influenza and respiratory viruses programme at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), said the H7N9 flu outbreak in humans was one that should be taken extremely seriously and watched closely. 'We are at the start of a very long haul with H7N9,' Nicoll told Reuters in a telephone interview. He said there were many scientific questions to be answered about the new flu strain, which was first detected in patients in China in March having been previously unknown in humans. The flu has so far infected at least 127 people in China and killed 27 of them, according to latest data from Chinese health authorities and the World Health Organization. Scientific studies of the virus have established it is being transmitted from birds - probably mostly chickens - to people, making it a so-called zoonotic disease that humans catch from animals rather than from other humans. Nicoll, who visited Beijing and Shanghai last week with a team of international scientific experts, confirmed what the WHO has repeatedly said - that there is no evidence yet of the virus efficiently passing from person to person - a factor that would make H7N9 a serious pandemic flu threat if it were to evolve. A worker sprays disinfectant in a live poultry market in Banchiao, New Taipei City, ahead of a sweeping ban on live poultry slaughter in markets that will take effect across Taiwan in two weeks . Nicoll said the 'most pressing public health question' for now was to identify the source of the circulating virus - the so-called 'reservoir' - that is leading to chickens contracting it and sporadically passing it on to humans. This is likely to take time, with any results unlikely for several months. He said the ECDC, which monitors disease in the European Union, and health authorities around the world should expect that 'imported cases' of H7N9 flu may well begin to crop up elsewhere. Flu experts speaking at a briefing in London on Wednesday said those mutations, together with evidence that H7N9 is still mutating rapidly and probably spreading almost invisibly among birds because it does not make them obviously sick, meant this new flu was a 'serious threat' to world health. 'You can never predict anything about flu, but it is concerning to see those mutations there, Nicoll said. 'That's why it's important Europe should take this very seriously.' Nicoll added that he thought the Chinese were doing an 'impressive job' handling, reporting, investigating and seeking to contain the outbreak.","Former government chief scientist Lord May accused Chinese team of 'blind ambition'

Mrs Sandiford, 57, was caught carrying cocaine worth £1.6 million in May last year. Rizvi, 52, who has a luxury home in . Park Lane, was a major shareholder in Bank Century. He is accused of . moving £900 million of distressed debt securities into accounts around the world along with another . key shareholder. Rizvi, . who also has homes in the Bahamas and Singapore, was this year linked to a buyout of Glasgow Rangers FC, despite being on an . Interpol wanted list. He claims he is the innocent victim of a political . conspiracy. Cashmore, a 34-year-old roofer from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, was convicted last year of smuggling 14lbs of crystal meth. There is no extradition treaty between Britain and Indonesia, but Mr Syamsuddin Indonesia was willing to discuss ‘co-operation on the transfer of sentenced persons’. Scroll down for video . Despair: Mrs Sandiford at her trial earlier this year, when she lost her appeal against a death sentence . Opposed: The Foreign Office said it was against the use of the death penalty . The .

Rizvi's . lawyers claim he could face the death penalty if sent to Indonesia, . should further corruption charges be levelled against him. Speaking after his return to Jakarta, Mr Syamsuddin said he had 'conveyed our hope' for the extradition of Rizvi from Britain. He said he had been told the matter would be raised with the Home Office, which is responsible for the decision. He . also said a request had been made to him for a special case to be made . for Sandiford and Cashmore to serve out jail terms in Britain. A . Foreign Office spokesperson said Baroness Warsi had expressed Britain’s . opposition to the use of the death penalty at the meeting on July 30 . and had appealed for Sandiford and Cashmore to be spared execution.

Sandiford has lost her appeal against her death sentence in Bali in April. A spokesman for Bali High Court announced that the court had rejected an appeal from the 56-year-old from Cheltenham. Sandiford was caught . smuggling cocaine in the lining of a suitcase from . Bangkok to the island last year. She . got a death sentence despite taking part in a sting after her arrest . which resulted in the arrest and conviction of the smuggling plot’s . alleged masterminds, who got lighter sentences. When . the death sentence was first delivered, the judges said Sandiford had . damaged the image of Bali as a tourist destination and weakened the . government's anti-drugs programme. As . it was read out, there were gasps of surprise in Denpasar District . Court as not even the prosecution had been seeking the death penalty. Mule: Sandiford insisted that the drugs found in her suitcase lining were planted . The British grandmother is being kept in Kerobokan jail in Bali, Indonesia. A court official confimed his office had received the appeal request from the prison . In . her witness statement, Sandiford said: 'I would like to begin by . apologising to the Republic of Indonesia and the Indonesian people for . my involvement. 'I . would never have become involved in something like this but the lives of . my children were in danger and I felt I had to protect them.' During . the trial, her lawyer read out a statement from her son which said: 'I . love my mother very much and have a very close relationship with her. 'I know that she would do anything to . protect me. I cannot imagine what I would do if she was sentenced to . death in relation to these charges.' Briton Julian Ponder, 43, the plot’s . alleged mastermind, was sentenced to six years for possessing cocaine . after initial accusations of conspiracy to traffic drugs were reduced. His . partner Rachel Dougall, 38, got one year for failing to report a crime . while a third Briton, 40-year-old Paul Beales, jailed for four years for . possessing drugs.

The Foreign Office also reiterated . the UK's opposition to the death penalty and said it had repeatedly made . representations to the Indonesian government about this case. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We . are disappointed to hear that Lindsay Sandiford's appeal has been . refused by the High Court in Bail. 'The UK strongly opposes the death penalty and has repeatedly made representations to the Indonesian government on this matter. 'We will continue to provide consular assistance at this difficult time.' 'King of Bali': Ponder, 43, seen in the grounds of Kerobokan Prison, had previously bragged that he would not receive a death sentence . Jailed: Ponder's partner, 39-year-old Rachel Dougall, was sentenced for her part in the plot, which involved smuggling £1.6million worth of cocaine into Bali . Let-off: Dougall, left, got a one-year sentence for her part in the plot, and Ponder, right, believes his sentence will also be low . The decision follows Foreign Secretary William Hague's earlier plea not to execute the grandmother from Cheltenham. Mr Hague sent a strongly-worded appeal to the three judges . through the Foreign Office arguing Sandiford’s death penalty is . 'unwarranted because it is an excessive punishment'. The . 14-page submission, shown to the Mail on Sunday by a court insider, . says the British government has 'serious concerns' over Sandiford’s . case. 'The government . requests that the court takes into account the violations of Mrs . Sandiford’s fundamental rights and decide that in these circumstances . the death penalty would not be appropriate,' it says. Foreign Secretary William Hague has urged Indonesia not to execute drug smuggling grandmother Lindsay Sandiford . 'Allegations . of mistreatment of Mrs Sandiford during the initial period in detention . have been raised. This includes threats with a gun and sleep . deprivation. 'The UK . government also has serious concerns at the absence of immediate – and . prolonged delay of – consular notification. This is all the more . concerning given the absence of legal representation and a translator . during the period of detention.' The . document – known as an Amicus Brief  – says Sandiford’s death penalty . should be reduced to a jail term and implies her execution would have . diplomatic repercussions. 'Mrs . Sandiford is a 56 year old woman. She has two sons and an infant . grandchild who would plainly be seriously affected were Mrs Sandiford to . be executed,' it says. 'Mrs Sandiford cooperated with the authorities with a view to detaining others who were involved in the drug trafficking. 'The High Court should take into account this cooperation, especially given that the others involved have now been convicted.' British . embassy officials in Indonesia did not learn of Sandiford’s arrest for . nearly two weeks after her initial arrest as she cooperated in the . drawn-out police sting. 'The . (British) government wishes to draw the attention of the court to the . allegations of mistreatment by officials when Mrs Sandiford was first . detained,' says the document. 'This . mistreatment constituted violations of Mrs Sandiford’s fundamental . rights under international law and Indonesian constitutional law. 'Mrs . Sandiford was also not provided with a lawyer during the period of . interrogation and in addition concerns have been raised about the . adequacy of Mrs Sandiford’s legal representation during parts of the . trial process.' Criticising . the January sentence in the district court in the island capital . Denpasar, document argues: 'It is not apparent that the court took . account of these considerable mitigating factors when making its . decision. 'The fact . that the prosecution did not seek the death penalty gives weight to the . inappropriateness of the death sentence in Ms Sandiford’s case.' Human rights organisation Reprieve has previously said it believes there is evidence to show that Sandiford was threatened and coerced into acting as a courier. Indonesia has an estimated 114 prisoners on death row. Most of the more than 40 foreigners among them have been convicted of drug crimes, according to a March 2012 report by Australia's Lowy Institute for International Policy.","Lindsay Sandiford, 56, was sentenced to death in January by judges in Bali .

Two escaped murderers who were released from a Florida prison after forging a court order were just hours from fleeing the state when U.S. Marshals arrested them at a motel, it has been revealed. A witness captured dramatic cell phone video of heavily-armed federal Marshals taking down Joseph Jenkins and Charles Walker after surrounding their motel room Saturday in Panama City, Florida. Investigators say that the pair, who have been on the run for three weeks, arrived at the motel room separately after a friend book them room for them. They were waiting for a car to arrive from Atlanta. The driver was going to take them out of state. Scroll down for video . Busted: One of the escaped killers is seen here surrendering, kneeling with his hands behind his head . Two U.S. Marshals rush in an apprehend the convicted killer, who lays on the ground after receiving commands from other Marshals on a bullhorn . Great escape: Joseph Jenkins, left, and Charles Walker, right, have been caught after using forged documents to get out of prison where they were both serving life sentences . The video from witness Amanda McComb . shows one of the suspects would out of the motel room with his hands up, . then kneel and put his hands on the back of his head. Seconds later, the second suspect exits the motel room and kneels with his hands behind his head. Deputy Marshals can be seen storming the room to make sure no one else is left, then handcuffing Jenkins and Walker. The arrests came just hours before the convicted killers were about to leave the state, and possibly escape justice forever, ABC News reports. Marshals . flooded the Coconut Grove Motor Inn after a friend of the murderers . tipped off police that they were hiding out there, according to WJHG-TV. Marshals rush into the motel room after the second suspect emerges. About 20 federal agents were involved in the raid Saturday . Walker and Jenkins were mistakenly . released from a Florida prison with forged paperwork, and even showed up . to another prison facility three days later to register as ex-cons. Jenkins, 34, walked out of Franklin . Correctional Institution in Carrabelle, Florida, on September 27 after . submitting a forged order from a judge that reduced his life sentence to time served. Days later, Walker, also 34, used the same paperwork to get his life sentence similarly 'reduced,' as well. He was released on October 8. The men were so convinced that their . scheme had worked, they showed up at another correction facility to . register as ex-cons that had been released into the community. Family members and friends of two convicted killers initially thought their release was legitimate and spent time with them, even planning a birthday party for one. But in the weeks after their release, relatives learned that the men were freed because of forged documents that reduced their life sentences to 15 years. Caught: Both convicts were arrested at the Coconut Grove Motel in Panama City on Saturday evening . Henry Pearson, who was described as . Jenkins' father figure, said he brought the convict clothes when he . picked him up from prison, and drove him to see his mother and . grandmother. Mr Pearson . planned a birthday party at his home for Jenkins, who turned 34 on . October 1, a few days later, but he never showed up. At a news conference on Saturday, family members of both men pleaded with them to turn themselves in. 'We . love you. We believe in you. We just want you to surrender yourself to . someone you trust who will bring you back here safely. We don't want any . harm to come to you,' Walker's mother, Lillie Danzy said. Ms . Danzy said the family thought their prayers had been answered when she . got the call saying Walker would be released October 8. She . was so shocked and delighted that she called the prison back twice to . make sure it was true, and was told the same information each time, an . attorney for the family said. Appeal: Walker's mother, Lillie Danzy, her husband Jeff, listen as Jenkins' uncle, Henry Pearson, calls for the men to turn themselves in . Manhunt: The families of the two escaped convicts made an emotional appeal to them a few hours before Jenkins and Walker were caught . Walker was taken by prison staff to a bus station so he could travel home, and the convict even attended church during his pseudo release. His mother said the family have been cooperating with authorities and made no attempts to hide him. Just like Jenkins, Walker registered . as a felon at the jail three days after he was released. Both men signed . paperwork, were fingerprinted and even photographed before walking out . of the jail without raising any alarms. By . registering, the men drew less attention to their forged release. Had . one of the murder victim's families not contacted prosecutors, . authorities might not have known about the mistaken releases. Orange-Osceola State Attorney Jeff Ashton told the Orlando Sentinel he found out about Jenkins' escape after his victim's family told prosecutors that he had been released. That led to the discovery that Walker also was out of prison. Emotional: Lillie Danzy says she called the prison twice after being told her son was due to be released early . 'We're looking at the system's breakdown, I'm not standing here to point the finger at anyone at this time,' Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said on Friday. The Corrections Department has since changed the way it verifies early releases and state legislators promised to hold investigative hearings. Chief . Judge Belvin Perry, who presided over the Casey Anthony trial, believes . that the two inmates had outside help in forging the documents. Judge Perry told the Orlando Sentinel: 'I strongly believe they had some help. It is unlikely [the documents] were produced by the inmates.' However he has few leads on who might have falsified the documents and it is unclear how they were filed. Investigations are ongoing. Judge Belvin Perry, who presided over the Casey Anthony trial, had his signature forged on fake court documents that led to the early release of two convicted murderers . The court orders appeared legitimate, said Judy Perry,  with the county seal, letterheads and identical formatting to real papers. Whoever created the documents had 'elementary knowledge', according to the judge. It is not the first time a Florida convict has used a forged signature from a judge to secure his release. When Judge Thomas McGrady heard of Walker and Jenkins' escape his 'Reaction was ""Oh no, not again"",' he told WTSP. In 2009 Nydeed Nashaddai, 44, used a forged court order bearing Judge Thomas's name to escape prison, where he was serving a sentence for theft. Walker and Jenkins were doing time for more serious crimes however. Walker was serving life for a second-degree murder committed in Orange County in April 1999. Set free: Both men walked out of the Franklin Correctional Facility in Florida after corrections officers were duped by falsified court documents saying the prisoners had been granted an early release . He told investigators at the time that . he had intended to frighten 23-year-old Cedric Slater whom he said had . been intimidating him. Walker fired three shots, one of which struck . Slater and killed him. Jenkins was also serving life in prison for the first-degree murder of a father of six in Orlando in September 1998. Jenkins and his cousin Angelo Pearson had planned a home invasion at the home of Roscoe Pugh, 28. The father of six died from gunshot wounds.","Joseph Jenkins and Charles Walker, both 34, went on the run after being accidentally released from a Florida prison in the last month .

David Sedaris was one of six siblings, but in May this year that number became five when his youngest sister, Tiffany, committed suicide, shortly before her 50th birthday. Now, for the first time, the author and broadcaster has opened up about her death, her life and his feelings for her. He admits that he didn’t really know her very well – and so some of the things he discovered once she’d passed away gave him a shock. Candid: David Sedaris, pictured here in Seoul in 2012, reveals that he didn't know Tiffany very well and was shocked by some of the things they found at her house . Firstly, there was the will – which stipulated that the family was not allowed to have her body or go to her memorial service, he wrote in The New Yorker. Tiffany’s house, in Somerville, Massachusetts, contained very few belongings – a mattress on the floor and two boxes’ worth of possessions. These were collected by David's actress sister, Amy. And in them were family photos that had been ripped to shreds. He wrote: ‘It seemed such a melodramatic gesture, like throwing a glass against a wall. Something someone in a movie would do.’ The family also discovered that she’d been a regular drug user, when she was young, at least. A classmate had drawn a marijuana leaf beside her name in an old school year book. And someone had written: ‘Call me sometime this summer and we’ll go out and get blitzed.’ David's actress sister Amy, who starred in Shrek the Third, collected Tiffany's belongings . Also in the house were ‘comment cards from a neighborhood grocery store, notebooks, receipts, a paper plate on a dresser that had several drawers missing, a phone number written on a wall, and a collection of mop handles, each one a different color, arranged like cattails in a barrel painted green’. A survey of Tiffany’s house revealed nothing about why she might have taken her own life, he said. The Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls author describes how looking at Tiffany’s possessions was fascinating, because of how little he knew her. The 56-year-old said: ‘Each of us had pulled away from the family at some point in our lives - we’d had to in order to forge our own identities, to go from being a Sedaris to being our own specific Sedaris. Tiffany, though, stayed away.’ Tiffany’s death was something that just didn’t add up for David. He added: ‘How could anyone purposefully leave us, us, of all people? Ours is the only club I’d ever wanted to be a member of, so I couldn’t imagine quitting.’","David's sister had ripped up family photographs and forbidden his family from attending her memorial service .

The victim of a home invasion in St Paul, Minnesota identified the three robbers who held him at gun-point last month by spotting them in rap videos on YouTube. On September 25, neighbors spotted the three men walking around the 600 block of Winthrop Street near Margaret Avenue in East St Paul, seemingly handing out pamphlets. But when the 31-year-old victim opened his door, one of the men, since identified as 33-year-old Teng Vang, thrust a gun in his face and another hit him. Caught online: The victim of a home invasion last month in St Paul, Minnesota identified all three of his attackers in YouTube rap videos. Above, two of the suspects: Teng Vang (left) and Theng Thao (right) Found: Accomplice Chozon Yang Chang managed to allude authorities longer than Vang and Thao. He was finally arrested yesterday . The three men then pushed their way into the house and zip-tied the victim's hands behind his back, demanding $200,000 in cash, drugs and to know where a man named 'Meng' was. But the victim didn't know any 'Meng' and even proved it by showing them his cell phone phone book. One of the suspects threatened the victim that 'they've done this before and know what they're doing'. The men put on blue gloves and two of them started to search the home while Vang kept watch of the victim. While the men were searching the house, Vang took the victim into his daughters bedroom where the 2-year-old was sleeping and pointed a gun at her, threatening to shoot if the victim didn't tell them where the money was. In the end, the victim handed over $2,000 he intended for rent and a deposit. They also made off with a laptop, an iPad, two handguns and a couple of Michelob Golden Light beers. Before leaving, the men took the victim down to the basement there they placed a black plastic shopping bag over his head, moved his hands in front of him and tied them with phone cords. The man was eventually able to bite through the cords, grab his daughter and call police. But just three days later, it was the victim and not police who brought the suspects to justice.

Three police officers were last night accused of using ‘weasel words’ after they denied lying to help bring down former Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell. Inspector Ken MacKaill, Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Sergeant Chris Jones yesterday issued a partial apology for their conduct following a meeting with Mr Mitchell at the height of the ‘Plebgate’ row last year. But they pointedly did not apologise to the former Government chief whip himself. Forced to quit: Andrew Mitchell arriving at Downing Street on his bike . Friends of Mr Mitchell said their statement did not go far enough and called for them to face disciplinary proceedings. Former shadow home secretary David Davis said: ‘After bringing down a Cabinet minister, a half-apology won’t do. These people are guilty of a serious misconduct.’ Mr Mitchell admits losing his temper and swearing after police guarding the gates of Downing Street stopped him riding his bicycle through the gates on a September evening last year. But he has always denied using the toxic word ‘plebs’, as claimed in a ‘police log’ leaked to the media. A secret recording made by Mr Mitchell of the meeting with the three officers in his Sutton Coldfield constituency last October reveals them apparently accepting his account of the incident. But just minutes later the three, all senior members of the Police Federation, told reporters that he had failed to explain what had happened and called for him to resign. Statement: Chris Jones, Stuart Hinton and Ken McKaill, pictured leaving the meeting with Andrew Mitchell, today issued a half-hearted apology for talking to the media . On October 12 last year Andrew Mitchell met three members of the Police Federation to discuss the 'Plebgate' case. A tape recording of the reveals Mr Mitchell going to great lengths to explain what happened in Downing Street. He . said: 'I did not say and I give you my word, I give you my word, I did . not call an officer an f'ing pleb I did not say you are an f'ing moron . and I did not say you should know your f'ing place. 'I would never speak to anyone like that least of all a police officer and you have my word I never said those things.' Later . Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton said to Mr Mitchell: 'I appreciate your candour, and we . appreciate you have gone beyond what you said in, to the media.' But . minutes later outside the meeting, Inspector Ken MacKaill, from West . Mercia Police, accused Mr Mitchell of refusing to give any more detail . of the incident. Mr MacKaill said: 'I think Mr Mitchell has no option but to resign. 'He is continuing to refuse to elaborate on what happened. I think his position is untenable.' The three men were controversially cleared of misconduct last week following an internal investigation by West Mercia Police. But, in an extraordinary intervention, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said the investigation was wrong to clear them. In a statement yesterday the three officers apologised for talking to the media, but denied lying. ‘The reputation of, and public confidence in, the police service is of immense concern to each of us,’ they said. ‘We acknowledge the investigation’s criticism relating to our poor judgment in talking to the media following the meeting with Andrew Mitchell, for which we take this opportunity to apologise. 'We would like to emphasise that in no way did any of us ever plan or intend to mislead anyone about what occurred during this meeting or otherwise.’ But friends of Mr Mitchell dismissed the statement. Mr Davis said: ‘The transcript of the meeting shows that the federation deployed a premeditated line of attack against Mr Mitchell. 'This is not a case of misjudgment, it is deliberate misconduct and they should face the consequences of that misconduct.’ Fellow Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘These weasel words are no substitute for proper accountability of sworn officers for what the IPCC deemed a deliberate lie intended to bring down an elected Cabinet minister in pursuit of a political agenda.’ Tomorrow, the chief constables of the West Mercia, West Midlands and Warwickshire forces, which employ the three officers, will be grilled by MPs on the Commons Home Affairs Committee. David Shaw, chief constable of the West Mercia force, will be pressed on revelations from the IPCC that the internal inquiry’s conclusions were changed at the eleventh hour to clear the three. Mr Cameron led calls for Mr Mitchell to receive a full apology from the three senior officers. Doubts: CCTV footage of the original exchange between Mr Mitchell and police officers at the gates of Downing Street raised questions about the official police log . Speaking at Prime Minister’s Questions, he said the issue at stake was not what happened at the gates of Downing Street but the subsequent meeting. He told MPs: 'The former chief whip had a meeting with Police Federation officers in his committee where he gave a full account of what had happened, they left that meeting and claimed he had given them no account at all. 'Fortunately this meeting was recorded so he has been able to prove that what he said was true and what the police officers said was untrue.' Home Secretary Theresa May also condemned the officers, warning the issue struck at the heart of public trust in the police. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg claimed the three police officers met Mr Mitchell with ‘one intention in mind’ — to end his political career.","Mr Mitchell denies calling Downing Street officers 'plebs' last year .

Katelyn's wish list has produced an outpouring of affection and . generosity towards the teen. The page has raised more than $80,000, most . of which has been donated this week. Donations will be withdrawn from the . site on April 2. The check will be sent to Katelyn and her family, along . with copies of all of the messages of support. The website, GoFundMe.com, takes a percentage from each donation, but the rest of the money will be sent to the family. Some of the money will go to churches . and families that Katelyn wanted to support, she told her mother. The . money will also be used to cover funeral expenses. 'I've never seen this community come . together quite as much as they have over one single person,' said Sharon Shepherd, an instructor at Katelyn's school and prom coordinator.

Big day: Katelyn, who had bone cancer, was hospitalized earlier in the day as she struggled to breathe . 'That was amazing just seeing everybody. Rolling down the windows just saying hi to everybody,' said Katelyn after the event. Originally Katelyn had been due to attend Tuesday night's prom which was held at The . Stables in LaFollette, and had been personalized for the teenager, with the . theme 'Katie in the Sky with Diamonds'. 'She contacted me and said prom must go . on, that's her, and you can't help but feed off that energy, that life,' Sharon Shepard, an instructor at Katelyn's school and prom coordinator, told WATE-TV.

'We . wanted to try to make this day, and this time in her life, special to . her because she makes it special for people in Campbell County,' he . said. Smiling until the end: Katelyn, 14, was diagnosed with bone cancer in her arm in May 2011 . Healthier days: Friends and family have said that Katelyn was headstrong, upbeat and one-of-a-kind . Katelyn's mother, Erica Nelson, . previously said they hoped to complete as many activities as possible as . she spent her last days at home. 'I just want to give her what she isn't . going to see and just try to fulfill what she wants to do. It's not . really much, but it's something to her,' she said.

A tragedy was averted with just seconds to spare when the pilots - two on each aircraft - physically saw each other and took evasive action, with one plane climbing and the other diving. At one point they were only 100ft apart vertically. When the alarm was first sounded the jets were about ten miles apart. Within a minute, they were less than three miles apart horizontally and closing. Despite a lengthy investigation, experts are at a loss to explain how the crews of both aircraft either misheard or misinterpreted their orders. The near-disaster occurred in broad daylight on June 23 at a position about 30 miles north of Glasgow. Tragedy was averted only when the pilots - two on each aircraft - physically saw each other . Near miss: This air control data shows how close the planes came to colliding after pilots ignored warnings about the paths they were on . However, details have only just emerged in a report from the UK Airprox Board, which looks into near-misses in British airspace. It concludes: 'It was apparent that both crews had taken each others' instructions.' But it adds the experts 'found it hard to determine why this had occurred'. 'The board was surprised that all four pilots had misheard or misinterpreted the avoiding action instructions despite at least one of the crews reading them back correctly,' said the report. They could not have confused their callsigns as they were not similar, and the radio transmissions were clear. The report said the crews may have been distracted as they received clearances to cross the ocean and settled into their transatlantic routine, and were caught off guard by the alert. 'Expecting only routine information to be transmitted at that time, they may have been perplexed by the avoiding action information and instinctively responded without properly assimilating it,' it said. The board said that the danger to the aircraft was increased because they had earlier needlessly been ordered by air traffic control to fly at the same height - 34,000 ft.","Planes had 1,000 on board when they almost crashed over Scotland .

Groupon's quirky former CEO, Andrew Mason, has been working hard on a new music album since he was ousted from the online deals company in February. The seven-song album, Hardly Workin’, released this week drops business knowledge on listeners with tracks such as The Way to Work, My Door is Always Open and the hip-hop influenced Stretch. The latter begins ‘we all know that you gotta have goals every quarter’. Groupon's failure to meet such goals was part of the reason the 32-year-old Mason was fired. CEO to musician: Groupon founder Andrew Mason has released a new album, Hardly Workin' Fired: Mason was dismissed as CEO from Groupon in February this year . His ouster had been expected for months given investor concerns about the troubled company's declining stock price and financial problems. Although Groupon pioneered the daily deals business, it spawned many copycats and faced worries that people are tiring of the restaurant, spa and Botox deals that Groupon built its business on. Mason, a former punk band keyboardist, calls the album ‘motivational business music’. It is available for $9.99 on iTunes and is also streamed on Spotify. Reviews of the album have been mixed, with one comment on iTunes calling it 'hilarious'. Another user says: 'Andrew Mason is famous for being a prankster. And I'm pretty sure no self-respecting man would put out this kind of music seriously.' 'I'm debating whether or not this is great or terrible. I find it a little ironic, some of the lyrics. I think I like it but dude...at least become CEO of the record label,' reads another comment. Musician: Andrew Mason used to be a keyboardist in a punk band . Musical couple: Andrew Mason is married to folk musician Jenny Gillespie . Andrew Mason founded Groupon in 2008 with the concept of selling deals to local businesses. In late 2010 it was reported that Groupon’s annual revenue was $800 million. In December that year Groupon turned down a $6 billion acquisition bid from Google. In 2012 Mason was named ‘Worst CEO of the Year’ by CNBC due to his ‘goofball antics’. Mason was fired as Groupon's CEO on February 28, 2013 after the company fell far short of the profit mark. In a letter to Groupon employees on the day of his dismissal, Mason wrote, ‘As CEO, I am accountable’ In the months after his dismissal, Mason started work on his album, Hardly Workin’, which he released this week. The seven-song album is available on iTunes and Spotify. ‘This album pulls some of the most . important learnings from my years at the helm of one of the fastest . growing businesses in history, and packages them as music,’ Mason wrote . on his blog. ‘Executives, mid-level management and front-line employees are all sure to find valuable takeaways.’ Here's the opening line: ‘If you're . seeking business wisdom, you don't need no MBA, look no further than the . beauty that surrounds us every day.’ And it goes on from there. As of Wednesday afternoon, there were no music videos available on YouTube. Mason, who studied music at Northwestern University, is married to folk singer, Jenny Gillespie. He founded Groupon Inc in 2008. To diversify its business, Groupon has expanded into product sales, payments services, restaurant reservations and other areas.

You need to pick the meatiest pumpkin,' Talented: Using his background in high art and his work in designing models for D.C and Marvel comics, Ray Villafane has sculpted intricate faces out of the common pumpkin. Pictured are 'Crying', left, and 'Mechanic' 'Sometimes I pick up a beautifully shaped pumpkin but when I do I realise that it is not heavy enough. Its wall is just not thick enough for the carving rigours. 'I also like a pumpkin with character. One with nobly ridges is good, so that I can utilise that in the carving procedure, like with sculpting noses. 'The sculpting has always been a passion.

A pair of British students have developed a new technology capable of turning anything into an iPad-style tablet computer. Dubbed the 'next big thing in home technology', the system lets people transform normal objects, such as an envelope or a fridge, into a tablet using a projector, depth camera and a PC. The pair even showcased the PhD students' technology at a research conference hosted by Google at its Californian headquarters. Scroll down for video . John Hardy and Carl Ellis from Lancaster University have created a system that lets you turn normal objects, such as an envelope or bed post, into a tablet computer. Mr Hardy, pictured, checks the temperature on his front door before leaving his house . The innovation was created by students John Hardy and Carl Ellis, both 25, from Lancaster University. The software is called Ubi Displays and . uses a projector, a depth camera and a PC to create interactive . multi-touch displays anywhere and on anything. Currently, the device, which is in a prototype phase includes all the technology in a rather bulky box that must sit opposite the object that the person wants to use as a tablet. It does not rely on any other computers or devices. The technology uses a high-tech projector to beam an image of an iPad, alarm clock, or any chosen device onto an object. A webcam see pixels in red, . green and blue along with depth and feeds details of what a person is doing and their movement back . to the user’s computer. The computer then uses their software to . work out where the user’s fingers are and what they are doing within . the projected image to carry out a user's desired task. The innovative software is called Ubi Displays and uses a projector, a depth camera and a PC to create interactive multi-touch displays anywhere and on anything, such as this fridge . This means a user could turn their bed into a high-tech interactive office and do a day’s work without getting up. The pair said they are looking to develop their work commercially and are being supported by their university. They hope that with development, the box of tricks will shrink to the size of a smartphone. A promotional video the pair have filmed for YouTube shows an alarm clock being turned off simply by the touch of a bed post and BBC news headlines running across the headboard. The pair showcased their invention at a Google research conference in America. The technology is used on a fridge, pictured . The video also shows a plain envelope being used just like an iPad. Hardy said the beauty of the software package is that it makes building interactive projected displays quick and easy. He said: 'As our lives continue to 'go digital', we need interfaces that are able to integrate our digital world with our physical lives. 'Phones in pockets or screens on desks are not necessarily the best way forward because they are very restrictive in quite a number of ways. Mr Hardy (left) and Mr Ellis (right) aim to develop their Ubi Displays technology and have created their own company . 'Playing, changing and experimenting with these designs can completely change how people use computers and how they behave as a result. 'Our technology is designed to be is quick and easy to set up and it does not require a hardcore programmer or team to develop interesting content. 'Indeed, in the physical world, being able to make a bedpost glow is in some ways a more compelling interface than a button on an iPhone app.' He believes that the technology will one day be small enough to fit inside a light bulb. The engineers said: 'What is unique about our offering is that it is not about screens any more. We can create interactive furniture, objects and pretty much anything you can dream up.' The technology is used here to show the user, through words projected onto the sideboard, that the kettle is ready . The pair of students, who have launched their own company, Hardy & Ellis Inventions, have made the beta release of their toolkit available online. Mr Hardy said: 'We are very excited by the potential we feel the toolkit and software we have developed has commercially. 'It was fantastic to be asked to go over to California to show what we have to the people at Google.' While the pair acknowledge that the combination of project and touch interaction is not a new idea, Hardy said that their offering moves the idea on 'dramatically'.

Mandy Sellars, 38, has a condition that has caused her legs to grow uncontrollably her whole life. She even had her massive left leg amputated after it became infected with septicaemia. But the stump soon started growing again and within three years measured a metre in circumference and weighed 3stone. Scroll down for video . Mandy discovered she couldn't be fitted with special prosthetics as her legs had grown too big . Ms Sellars has now been told it has no name after genetic testing revealed it was the first case of its kind in the world. The condition makes it incredibly difficult for Mandy to move around and she is housebound during the week. She travels in a specially reinforced wheelchair. Doctors had hoped to fit her with a . prosthetic leg but as her stump kept growing, new legs had to be made . and to date she is still unable to walk. Mandy Sellars, pictured on This Morning in her electric wheelchair, said she has a 'zest for life' 'I find it incredibly frustrating,' Ms Sellars, from Huncoat in Lancashire, said. 'I have such a zest for life and I really want to get out there and live it.' This could now be a possibility, after scientists at Cambridge University took an interest in Ms Sellars' case. Over the past year, Dr Robert Semple has mapped her DNA from blood and tissue samples. Ms Sellars' presumed she had a rare form of Proteus Syndrome - the condition that affected the Elephant Man. However, the analysis revealed she had a unique disorder. 'I'm the first person in the world with it and it hasn't even got a name yet,' Ms Sellars told ITV's This Morning. 'I keep suggesting Dr Semple call it Sellars Syndrome!' As a result, Dr Semple's team have come up with a medication aimed at replacing her unique mutated gene with a therapeutic gene. 'I . started taking it in September and the aim was to stop my limbs growing . further. Actually they have started to shrink a little,' Ms Sellars' said. 'I just kind of accepted my condition would get worse and keep growing but I am more optimistic following the discovery.'

Dr Robert Semple studies Mandy Sellars over-sized right leg. He mapped her DNA and found out her condition was unique to her . 'There was clearly something dramatically different about me when I was born as my legs were so much bigger than my body. Doctors didn't know what it was and whisked me away - they didn't let my mother see me for two weeks. They didn't think I would survive.' Her left leg was three inches longer than her right, and both were out of proportion. But Mandy flourished despite their dire prognosis. 'I could walk around and play football as a child,' she said. 'I had friends and went to a comprehensive school for my GCSE's. But I found it harder to deal with as a teenager as you become more aware. Some people would stare and laugh at me. I find that easier to deal with now.' Her parents encouraged her to be . independent and she moved out of home at 19. She went to the University . of Central Lancashire where she gained a BSc in Psychology.

Visitors to Stonehenge will again be able to experience standing inside the ancient stone circle thanks to a 360-degree cinema. The battle for access to the World Heritage site has been fought for many years, with campaigners wanting to be allowed into the world-famous monument. At last, protestors may partially get their wishes, as English Heritage is developing a solution - a virtual visit in a panoramic cinema. New evidence: Studies of cremated human remains show that a larger stone circle was erected at the same site as a community graveyard . The picturehouse will be the jewel in the crown of a new £27million centre and will include a 32ft landscape wall, on to which computer generated images of the countryside around the circle and other ancient earthworks will be projected. The new auditorium’s 100ft circumference is smaller than the actual stone circle, which is around 300ft. It’s expected to be built just over a mile from the stones. Also planned are films providing information about the monument and prehistoric items, exploring theories over the uses of Stonehenge. Outside the complex, replica Neolithic dwellings are being built, where tourists can find out how early inhabitants of the sites might have lived. The latest analysis of the remains of a Neolithic settlement near the monument show that thousands of people travelled from as far as Scotland to the site, bringing their livestock and families for huge feasts and celebrations during the winter and summer solstices. The plans for the centre were revealed in a series of documents from English Heritage, which wants firms to provide the technological content for the audio visual displays, according to the Telegraph. The documents describe the ‘immersive 360 degree projected film’ as the 'most important and high profile piece of audio visual ever undertaken by EH'. Robert Campbell, the head of interpretation at the centre, said: ‘It’s meant to give people a sense of what it is like to stand in the middle of Stonehenge because most people just won’t be able to do that. 'It won’t feel like you are standing in a computer programme. The idea is to take our visitors back in time.’ Solar power: People celebrate the sunrise at the Winter Solstice at Stonehenge in Wiltshire . New studies of cremated human remains excavated from the site suggest that about 500 years before the Stonehenge we know today was built, a larger stone circle was erected at the same site as a community graveyard, researchers said. ‘These were men, women, children, so presumably family groups,’ University College London professor Mike Parker Pearson, who led the team, said. ‘We'd thought that maybe it was a place where a dynasty of kings was buried, but this seemed to be much more of a community, a different kind of power structure.’ The virtual visits may not win over . all campaigners including Pagans and Druids who want open access to . Stonehenge, which was created about 5,000 years ago. When . it was first opened to the public, it was possible to walk among and . even climb on the stones. However, they were roped off in 1977 due to . problems with erosion. However, English Heritage does permit access during the summer and winter solstice, and the spring and autumn equinox.

The mother of a 27-year-old woman who gave birth in a bar bathroom and stuffed the healthy baby boy in the toilet has revealed her daughter had struggled with 'very severe depression' and hard drugs. Karen H. Giesen, 51, said her only daughter Amanda Catherine Hein, from Pennsylvania, had been hospitalized for mental-health issues and had battled a substance abuse problem. Giesen said her daughter kept her troubles to herself, including her pregnancy: 'I don't know what she was going through because she never told me. She kept that completely to herself.' Held: Amanda Catherine Hein, 27, will remain behind bars while she . awaits trial for killing her baby son moments after he was born healthy . and alive . Hein is charged with murder and could face the death penalty if convicted because of the age of the baby . Prosecutors said Hein gave birth to an 'alive and viable' boy - carried from 33 to 36 weeks - in the bathroom at Starters Pub in Lower Saucon Township on August 18 before continuing to watch a pay-per-view wrestling match with three male friends. She reportedly found out she was pregnant in May or June but didn't tell anyone. Authorities believe Hein tore the umbilical cord with her hands, and cleaned up the stall before leaving the bathroom. She was in the bathroom for about 40 minutes. On August 19, janitors found the infant's body after the toilet wouldn't flush. Opening the tank, they uncovered the body wrapped in a plastic bag that had lined a small garbage can in the stall. The Lehigh Valley Express-Times reported an autopsy found that Hein had given birth to a healthy, full-term baby boy and the child had suffocated to death. Hein is being held in Northampton County Prison awaiting her October 28 preliminary hearing. It is not known who the father is.

'I just wish she would have even texted me and said, 'Please help me',' Giesen, of Coopersburg, said. 'I'm her mother and the thing that breaks my heart is she didn't come to me. She didn't ask for help.' Giesen . said her daughter, who had no significant criminal history, documented . domestic abuse or civil judgments due to financial hardship, was 'very . fragile'. 'She told me she thought I hated her and I don't hate her. I love her,' Giesen said. She said she'd tried to get psychiatric help for Hein, but there was little she could do because her daughter was an adult. Giesen, a born-again Christian, said she and her daughter 'don't see eye to eye on moral issues' and she didn't approve of Hein's lifestyle or ex-boyfriend. 'I don't judge her,' Giesen said. 'Anything I didn't agree with I kept to myself, because what was I going to do?'

In the latest in a series of quality issues, Ford is recalling 465,000 cars and SUVs globally after more than 600 complaints from customers about leaky fuel tanks, which are a fire hazard. The global recall affects the Fusion, Explorer, Taurus, Flex, Police Utility, Police Interceptor and the Lincoln MKS, MKT and MKZ models from the 2013 year. About 390,000 of the vehicles are in . the U.S., with another 23,000 in Canada and 7,600 in Mexico. The rest . are in Europe, South America, Asia and other areas. Popular model: The Ford Fusion has won accolades for the company but has been plagued by recalls for faulty parts and is one of the models involved in the latest recall of 2013 Ford vehicles . In a statement to the Detroit News, the company said the 'condition . could result in customers detecting a fuel odor, or in some cases, . observe evidence of a fuel leak on the ground.' 'While a fuel leak in the presence of an ignition source may result . in a fire, there have been no reports of fires. We are not aware of any . accidents or injuries attributed to this condition,' wrote Ford . spokeswoman Kelly Felker. Total recall: The Lincoln MKT was redesigned for 2013 and has 'a suite of significant improvements that match or exceed more expensive, imported luxury class competitors' but is one of the Ford models being recalled . New models: Lincoln promised seven new models over three years in 2011 - the recalled MKZ, MKS (pictured) and MKT are among the updated models . Ford has said it has a limited supply of . new fuel delivery modules to fix the fuel leak, so some Ford owners . will have to wait until September to have their fuel tanks fixed. Ford is also recalling 500 of its new . 2013 Lincoln MKZ mid-size sedans - 100 in the U.S. and the rest in . Canada - that are equipped with engine block heaters.

It represents another blow for the . mid-size Fusion sedan, which was redesigned last fall and is one of . Ford's best-selling models, but has been the subject of several recalls . since its launch. In the stars: The Ford Taurus was first introduced in 1986 and has been in continuous production for more than 20 years. The 2013 version of the car is among those recalled for a faulty fuel tank . About 80,000 Fusions were . recalled last December to check for engine leaks that could result in a . fire. Another 19,000 Fusions were recalled in November to correct . problems with the lighting system. Ford CEO Alan Mulally said earlier . this year the number of recalls wasn’t a problem, but . instead a sign that the venerable automaker was focused on quality. 'We learned . from every one of them,' he said.

In the heart of the city: Tour Saint Jacques, which is pictured dominating the skyline of Paris, offers stunning views of the French capital . The 62-metre (203-foot) stone tower offers visitors stunning bird's eye views from the heart of Paris - provided they have the energy to walk up its 300-step spiral staircase and pay the €6 euro entrance fee. From the zinc-topped terrace, the capital's most iconic landmarks compete for attention, from the neighboring Conciergerie, Ile-Saint-Louis and Notre-Dame to the Pompidou Centre, the Eiffel Tower, Montmartre and La Defense. Adorned with gargoyles and topped by a 3.5-metre statue of St James the Apostle, the tower is all that remains of the medieval church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie, pillaged and destroyed by French revolutionaries in the late 18th century. The bell tower - which will be open until September 15 - was spared for its beauty and possibly to be used as a watchtower to spot the capital's frequent and deadly fires, curators say.

A subsidiary of chocolate bar-maker Mars has been sponsoring savage bear-baiting contests in in Ukraine, an animal charity's investigation has revealed. Video taken by activists shows tape branded with the name Royal Canin being used at a competition which took place earlier this year near Vinnytsia, at the heart of the Eastern European country. The French pet food company, which was bought by Mars around a decade ago, said it was 'horrified' to learn that it had sponsored the brutal contest. Savage: Hunting dogs attack a chained brown bear in a bear-baiting contest in Ukraine, which an animal charity's investigation revealed was sponsored by the pet food subsidiary of global food giant Mars . Footage released by international animal welfare group Four Paws shows an event staged in woods where several dogs are set on a chained brown bear as a small audience of men look on. The animal has had its claws removed and its movements controlled by several men tugging on the chain, stopping it from mounting an effective defence against the dogs, which continually bite and harry the animal. Eventually the panicked bear begins to foam at the mouth from exhaustion and fear. The video shows a table laden with Royal Canin-branded trophies for the most aggressive dogs in the competition. Royal Canin, which makes food for cats and dogs, promotes itself with the slogan 'respecting the animal nature of dogs and cats'. But the evidence gathered by Four Paws will horrify animal lovers. The charity says it has evidence that Royal Canin has sponsored more than one bear-baiting contest. International animal welfare group Four Paws captured footage of the event near Vinnytsia, central Ukraine, earlier this year. Brown bears are legally protected in the country but are often victims of cruel treatment . The bear in the contest has had its claws removed and its movements controlled by several men tugging on the chain, stopping it from mounting an effective defence against the dogs as they bite and harry the animal . Dr Amir Khalil, a vet and project leader for the charity, speaking to The Observer, questioned Royal Canin's stated commitment to animal wellbeing. 'By sponsoring bear-baiting, Royal Canin is reducing wild animals like the brown bear to the rank of second-class animals,' he said. Four Paws has a memorandum of understanding with the Ukrainian government's department of ecology to eradicate bear baiting. Nevertheless, such contests still take place between four and six times a year, the organisation said. Although brown bears are, on paper, legally protected in the country, it has for a long time faced accusations of cruelty towards the animals, which are often forced to perform in Ukrainian zoos and circuses. 'Cruel lives': There are estimated to be between 15 and 20 baiting bears in Ukraine. They are taken from their mothers at just a few months old, their claws are removed and they are kept most of the time in small cages . 'Humbling': A Royal Canin branded trophy, to be awarded to the owners of the dogs judged to be the bravest. The company said it had taken action to cease its sponsorship of the events after it was alerted to its involvement . There are estimated to be between 15 and 20 baiting bears in Ukraine, according to Four Paws. A spokesman for the charity said: 'They live cruel lives in tiny cages with nothing but a concrete floor, and they are only released from these cages for training or to be attacked by hunting dogs. 'They are usually given insufficient food and water, to make them weaker opponents for the dogs.' Whether sourced from zoos, circuses or the wild, most baiting bears are snatched from their mothers at just a few months old. Most undergo a painful procedure to have their claws removed. Four Paws said Royal Canin had admitted to its involvement in the contest. In a statement to The Observer, the company said: 'Royal Canin has been absolutely horrified to see these images linked with our brand. The sponsorship of this event is not consistent with Royal Canin's animal welfare policy, our philosophy of pet-first or our vision.' Royal Canin said that after Four Paws alerted it to the 'humbling' incident in May it had taken immediate action to cease its sponsorship of bear-baiting contests. MailOnline contacted Mars UK for comment, but at the time of writing was still awaiting a response.","Event revealed in video released by animal welfare group .

Sometimes it's when I eat a . big meal, but other times I can just nibble a biscuit or a piece of . fruit, and my trousers suddenly don't fit.' She added: 'I've almost given up hope that I'll ever find a cure. It's not painful, just uncomfortable and embarrassing. 'I've learned to live with it, and I really have to see the funny side. My friends and family call it my 'food babies'.' While Kerri's condition baffles doctors, many suffer from an uncomfortable distended stomach. Gas and bloating is a sign that food is not being ingested correctly by the body. Bloating has several causes, the most common being accumulation of liquids and intestinal gas. Specific medical conditions like Crohn's Disease can also contribute to the amount of stomach bloating experienced. Too little or too much water will cause excessive stomach bloating. Another cause is fatty foods which cause a formation of fat cells to develop throughout the body and contribute to bloating as well. Food intolerances like lactose or fructose, can contribute to bloating, as well as food allergies. Other causes include irritable bowel syndrome, menstruation, ovary cysts, Celiac Disease and tumours. Some natural remedies can help alleviate symptoms. Exercising and drinking herbal teas or extra virgin olive oil can encourage bowel activity. Kerri first began suffering from extreme bloating when she hit puberty - but the problem has got worse as she has got older. At first, doctors believed she might be suffering from a reaction to gluten - but despite cutting all wheat products out of her diet, she still continued to bloat. She underwent further tests for irritable bowel syndrome - also known to cause bloating - but they came back negative. Kerri added: 'I was convinced it was something that I was eating that caused it, so I cut loads of different food groups systematically out of my diet. 'I spent about a year living as a vegan, with no red meat, wheat or dairy - but it didn't stop my stomach from expanding, and I never got to enjoy my food. 'I decided as it wasn't actually causing me any pain, I might as well eat the foods I enjoy, so I eat what I like now and don't deprive myself. 'Doctors are just as puzzled by it as I am, but as it doesn't seem to be causing any real harm, they've just told me it's one of those things I have to live with. 'Sometimes it comes up instantly, within about 15 minutes of eating, but other times it takes a few hours, and always takes a few hours to go down. 'It doesn't happen every time I eat, but it's at least a few times a week. 'If my friends plan to go for a meal before going out for the night, I always have to skip the food, because I don't want to go out in my maternity wear. 'I have got used to it now - it's something I think I will just have to live with.'",Kerri has had the bizarre bloating condition for a decade .

Marshall Huburn may look like a healthy and happy two-year-old - but he has a crippling disease. The smiley toddler from Birmingham suffers from arthritis. He has it in his jaw, spine, hips, knees, legs, elbows, feet, ankles, each finger and every toe. Every 12 weeks, Marshall goes with his mother Hayley, 23, to have eighty of his joints drained under general anaesthetic at Birmingham Children's Hospital. He also undergoes chemotherapy treatment to ease his pain at home every week. Marshall was diagnosed with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis when he was 18 months old. Mrs Huburn, who is currently pregnant with her fifth child, and her husband Frank, aged 41, knew something was wrong as they watched Marshall attempting to take his first steps. Mr Huburn said: ‘His feet kept on turning outwards when he tried to walk. He would be very clumsy. We took him to our doctor to get him checked out. ‘But we would never have imagined that he could have arthritis. ‘I only thought it was something you got if you were elderly. ‘I was absolutely gobsmacked. The doctor told me ""I know it's a lot to take in"". ‘I still remember the words - it was quite a shock. ‘I was worrying that my other children could have it as well, but they said it was very unlikely two siblings will have it.’ Mrs Huburn, who is three months pregnant and has three children, Frankie, four, Sommer, also four, and Caitlyn, seven months, said she struggled to accept that her son had to have chemotherapy at first. Crippling: Marshall has to go to Birmingham Children's Hospital every 12 weeks with his mother, Hayley (pictured left), to have eighty of his joints drained under general anaesthetic . Side-effects of the treatment can include liver failure, kidney failure and blood cancer. Mrs Huburn added: ‘Marshall can walk. On good days he's still very wobbly and he falls over quite a lot. Then, on bad days, he can't move. ‘He screams for hours. He'll just push himself against a wall to try to get up, or bum-shuffle around the floor. About three or four months after he was diagnosed he literally could not move, he couldn't stand and he was that way constantly, every day. ‘His brother and sister would go and play in the back garden and he wouldn't go out with them. ‘When we have good days now, it is a relief. Family support: Marshall Huburn with his brother and sisters, Frankie 4, Sommer 4, Caitlyn 7 months, and his mother, Hayley, and father, Frank . ‘To see him stand up actually amazes me, it is like I have been given my son back. ‘The other kids are brilliant with him, they play with him. He wants to do, and he does try to do, all the things that Frankie and Sommer will do but he can't always do them. But he still gives it a go. ‘To see him smile is really nice, having seen him in so much pain. It's like he is showing me that I'm doing something right to try to control his condition. ‘It was a big decision for me to actually accept his chemo treatment every week, because of the side effects it can have. ‘I panicked, thinking ""I don't want him to have more problems"". Then I thought ""I've got to, otherwise it's not helping him"". I think it's the best thing I've done. ‘You don't know what each day holds. One day he could get up and be running around, the next day he could not move. He can't talk so it's difficult for him to let us know how he is feeling. ‘Sometimes he might scream in pain, but he's always still got a smile on his face. It makes me feel happy. Cheerful: Marshall manages to keep a smile on his face despite being in pain and receiving treatment . ‘When he's screaming in pain it just feels horrible, I can't do anything to stop it.’ Mrs Huburn said doctors have been unable to identify why Marshall has developed the condition. He has the second most common type of juvenile idiopathic arthritis which affects between 10,000 and 15,000 children in the UK. Now Mrs Huburn is facing another battle, as the council house where she is living with her husband and their four children doesn't have a bath - essential for helping to ease Marshall's suffering. Doctors recommended that Marshall soak in a bath to help ease the stiffness and swelling in his joints. The shower, meanwhile, does not have a proper cubicle, has only released scalding hot water for the last five weeks, and has a rotten tray.

She said as the house had been converted from a two-bedroom to a three-bedroom house, the bathroom is smaller than it should be and there is no room for a bath. The spokeswoman added: ‘Contractors have been out several times to fix the shower and have reported to us they have left it in good working order. ‘Workmen sent the old shower away for testing after they installed the new one in January.’","Marshall Huburn has the disease in his jaw, spine, hips, knees, legs, elbows .

New research has discovered that volcanoes can sometimes 'scream' at ever-higher pitches just before they erupt. Scientists at the University . of Washington analysed an eruption sequence at Alaska's Redoubt Volcano and found what they describe as audible 'screams' that followed seismic activity as the changed from steady pulses to rapid . tremors. The researchers also believe that this research and the rise in the frequency of earthquakes and the tremors they cause in the ground could be used to predict future volcanic eruptions. Scroll down for audio clip . Some volcanoes 'scream' at ever-higher pitches before they erupt, scientists claim. American researchers believe a rise in the frequency of earthquakes could predict volcanic eruptions. They analysed an eruption sequence at Alaska's Redoubt Volcano in March 2009 (pictured) The study said that it is not unusual for swarms of small earthquakes to precede a volcanic eruption. They can reach a point of such rapid succession that they create a signal called a 'harmonic tremor' that is inaudible to humans as it is such a low frequency. The researchers analysed an eruption sequence at Alaska’s Redoubt Volcano in March 2009. They found that the harmonic tremor rose to . substantially higher frequencies and then stopped abruptly just before . six of the eruptions. Alicia Hotovec-Ellis, a doctoral student at  University of Washington, said: 'The frequency of this tremor is unusually high for a volcano, and it’s not easily explained by many of the accepted theories.' The activity hints at a volcano's pressure before an explosion, she said. The findings of the study, published in the Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research, could help scientists to better understand what happens during eruptive cycles in volcanoes. However, the source of earthquakes and harmonic tremor is not known. Earthquakes can reach a point of such rapid succession that they create a signal called a harmonic tremor, which reaches steadily higher frequencies and then stops abruptly before volcano eruptions. The spectacular explosion of the Kilauea Volcano Hawaii is pictured . Some volcanoes emit sound when magma resonates as it pushes up through thin cracks in the Earth’s crust. But the scientists think that in this case the earthquakes and harmonic tremors happen as magma is forced through a narrow channel under great pressure into the heart of the mountain. They believe that the thick magma sticks to the rock . surface inside the channel until the pressure is enough to move it . higher, where it sticks until the pressure moves it again. Each of these sudden movements leads to a small earthquake up to 1.5 on the Richter scale. As the pressure builds and the quakes get smaller but more frequent, they blend into a continuous harmonic tremor. Ms Hotovec-Ellis said: 'Because there’s less time between each earthquake, there’s not enough time to build up enough pressure for a bigger one. 'After the frequency glides up to a ridiculously high frequency, it pauses and then it explodes.' She believes that the pause in noise is when the earthquakes cannot keep up any more and the two sides of the fault slide smoothly against each other. The scientists documented the rising tremor . frequency, starting at about one hertz, which reached around 30 hertz. Scientists think the harmonic tremor they studied was caused by pressure building up in channels at the heart of the mountain. This caused earthquakes that blended into a continuous harmonic tremor which eventually lead to an explosion. A lava flow in the National Park in Kalapana, Hawaii is pictured . While humans cannot hear most of the noise, she said that a person lying on the ground directly above the . magma channel might be able to hear the harmonic tremor when it reaches . its highest point. This, however, is probably not advisable, since the highest-pitched tremor is followed by an explosion. Scientists . at the USGS Alaska Volcano Observatory have dubbed the . highest-frequency harmonic tremor at Redoubt Volcano 'the screams' because they reach such high pitch compared with a  one to five hertz starting . point. Ms Hotovec-Ellis created a 10 second recording of 10 minutes of seismic activity sound and harmonic tremor, which she sped up 60 times. A one minute recording that condenses an hour of activity includes a staggering 1,600 small earthquakes. The next step in the scientist's research is to understand why the stresses become so high.","American scientists have discovered that some volcanoes 'scream' just before they erupt .

Liverpool striker Luis Suarez has underlined his need to leave Anfield despite his love for the club and accused the media and the FA of driving him out. The Uruguay star is in South America preparing for the Confederations Cup and Liverpool have insisted he is not for sale. But Suarez, who is serving a 10-game domestic ban for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic, has again railed against his treatment from the media. Ready to say goodbye: Luis Suarez says he is being driven out of Liverpool . 'Ever since I arrived I have felt bad, they have never judged me for my play but with the attitude that he dives, protests, makes gestures, racism... everything,' Suarez told television show RR Gol. 'They have never spoken well of me. For that reason, when I was told I could win the Player of the Year award, I said, ""I will not get excited as I know that I will never win an important award in England"".' Suarez also feels the FA are against him, comparing his ban for racially abusing Patrice Evra with that of John Terry, who was suspended for half the amount of games after a similar incident with Anton Ferdinand. Suarez suggested the fact he is South American counted against him. Never given a chance: Suarez says he has been portrayed in a negative way by the media . 'Without any proof they gave me an eight-match ban, but with Terry, where they had proof, lip-readers, they gave him four. I'm South American and I think that's the root of all of this,' he added. 'Liverpool is a club that I dreamt about playing for as a boy. I have been with great players there, they know me and I would love to continue for many more years at Liverpool. The stadium is spectacular, the fans are phenomenal: people with tattoos of me, things that I could never have imagined. 'After the [Evra] suspension people would come up to me, this is something that really touched me and they would say, ""Luis forget everything and stay."" 'But I can't forget as it was something that I had to suffer, that my family had to suffer and away from football I have a family to support and who are hurt by these things.' Biting point: Luis Suarez sinks his teeth into Branislav Ivanovic's arm . Unfair: Suarez says his ban for racism against Patrice Evra was too harsh . Asked again where he sees himself going, should he leave he said: 'My agent said to remain calm rather than quiet, remain calm and when there is concrete interest you'll be the first to know.' Suarez also recounted a recent incident during a shopping trip, which affected him and his family. 'About a week ago I was walking in a shopping centre near Manchester and three or four guys asked me for a photo,' he revealed. 'While we were posing for it my wife said to me, ""Luis, get out of the photo"". She noticed they were making biting gestures. I was with my wife and my daughter. Things like that get on your nerves. My wife was on the brink of tears and the blokes ran off laughing. You get tired of stuff like that.' Is this the end? Suarez says he loves Liverpool but has to leave . Suarez has already said he would be open to a move to Real Madrid and added: 'I'm not sure if I see myself in the white (of Real Madrid), the only thing I know is that I have a contract,' he said. 'Any player would like to play for a great team and Real Madrid certainly are that. 'Every player wants to reach the very top and Real Madrid are at the very top, but everything that has been said is just rumours, I have had nothing concrete. 'Obviously Real Madrid is a great team . and every player dreams about them; Real Madrid is Real Madrid and it's . as high as you can go as a player and they will always tempt you.' The good and the bad: Suarez scored plenty of goals and was a favourite among Liverpool fans - but he drew criticism for his diving (below) Suarez says he and compatriot Edinson Cavani don't speak about their respective futures, with the Napoli striker also the subject of transfer interest. 'We have never really spoken about whether this club or that is interested. Obviously we talk about football; he asks me about the Premier League and I ask him about Italy,' he said. 'But we have never talked or even even joked about one of us going to one club or another. 'I would prefer to have him as a team-mate than a rival because he is a great player.

Former Vice President Dick Cheney has revealed that he had a signed resignation letter ready for much of his time in President George W. Bush’s administration in case he became incapacitated by a heart attack. Cheney has had five heart attacks- including one during the month of Bush’s first election- and felt that he had to prepare in case something happened while in office. During an interview on The Today Show, he said that one of his motivations in drawing up the unusual letter was because he looked back at the medical problems of Woodrow Wilson who had a stroke that incapacitated him but kept him in office due to the constraints of the Constitution. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Medical marvel: Dick Cheney has written about the technological advancements that have made it possible for him to survive five heart attacks and a transplant . In case of emergency: Cheney revealed that he wrote this letter of resignation and had it ready in case something happened, adding that George W. Bush was surprised by the move but saw its purpose . Cheney said that because there are no such altered provisions in the Constitution regarding the Vice President, he felt he needed to take his own action. In spite of this awareness, Cheney got defensive when questioned about whether or not his three prior heart attacks should have ruled him out from being elected Vice President in the first place. ‘I didn't seek the job, the president came to me, the party nominated me, the doctors that consulted on it reached a conclusion, the people elected me,’ he said during an interview with Sanjay Gupta on 60 Minutes on Sunday night. ‘At what basis do you want to override that decision making process? Do you want to have an offshoot where we come check with Sanjay Gupta and say “Gee, is he up to the task?” That's not the way it works.’ Opening up: Cheney is promoting a book he co-wrote alongside his cardiologist . Gupta went on to question a campaign doctor’s report who gave Cheney the all-clear, writing that at the time he had ‘normal cardiac function’ in spite of having had three heart attacks and having smoked three packs of cigarettes a day for more than two decades. ‘I'm not responsible for that. I don't know what took place between the doctors,’ he said. ‘There's no question I think based upon the fact that I did it for eight years that they were right.’ The 72-year-old Republican is promoting a book he co-wrote alongside his cardiologist about the ways in which medical advancements have dramatically improved conditions for patients with heart disease like himself. Way too big: Because his heart was too big (left), it made it harder for the organ to effectively pump blood throughout the body, and that problem was fixed with the new transplant organ . Unusual: This picture shows Cheney's old heart immediately after it was removed, and it was noticeably bigger than it should be . They also revealed that they debated . putting in a defibrilltor to help regulate the then-Vice President’s . blood flow, but they were concerned that a terrorist may be able to . remotely gain control of the heart and kill him. The scheme seems outrageous, but it resonates now as it was used as a plotline in the hit television series Homeland where a terrorist used that exact trick to kill the Vice President. ‘I was aware of the dangers that existed,’ Cheney said when asked about the parallels between his life and the fictitious show. ‘I know from the experience we had . and the necessity for adjusting my own device that it was an accurate . portrayal of what was possible.’ Art imitating life: Cheney's fears of a terror attack on a prospective defibrillator were played out in this episode of Homeland where the Vice President is killed by a terrorist remotely operating his heart mechanism . During his 60 Minutes appearance, Cheney and his doctor Jonathan Reiner showed pictures of Cheney’s old heart that was replaced with a transplant in March of last year and the size of the old heart showed just how damaged it was. According to the doctor, a healthy heart is typically the size of two hands clamped together; the heart that was removed from Cheney’s chest was half-a-foot wide. ‘It's one of those situations where bigger is not necessarily better,’ Cheney joked.

'Plain Janes' are often happier at school than the girls who seem most popular and attractive, according to an academic. Sociable and successful pupils often have the worst problems, says Professor Carrie Paechter, from Goldsmiths College in London. Girls further down 'the pecking order' are under less pressure to be perfect and to conform, the education professor will tell headteachers at a conference next week. Dressing the part: Lindsay Lohan (left) learns the importance of being one of the popular crowd in Mean Girls - but is being ordinary better for your mental health? 'There is a lot of pressure to be top of . the social group, but often girls who are popular aren’t well liked - they’re feared because they’re dominant,' she writes in a speech to be given at the Girls’ Schools Association annual conference in Liverpool. Although popular pupils may appear to be part of tight-knit friendship groups, girls who are part of these cliques often turn on each other, as is demonstrated in high school films such as Mean Girls. 'One group we studied at a school was . very dominant and they kept constant surveillance on each other, . checking they had their socks rolled down in the exact way and that . their hair was done properly,' said Professor Paechter, according to The Times. 'There was pressure to be beautiful all the time . or you were letting the group down. One of the girls was whispered about . because her ponytail wasn’t how it should be, and it took her all day to . realise what was wrong, then she was mortified. 'Girls further . down the pecking order don’t notice how their socks should be. Grounded: Prof Carrie Paechter, left, says girls should not worry about looks all the time, while Girls' Schools Association president Helen Wright, right, said the idea that popular girls were more respected was 'a myth' 'If you’re . being picked on that’s awful, but if you’re just ordinary you can have a . decent time at school, keeping out of it.' Superstar Julia Roberts last year admitted that she was not popular in high school. The Oscar-winning actress told Access . Hollywood Live: '[I was] just mediocre, just getting through the . hallways with my girlfriend Paige. 'We weren't losers, but we weren't popular, we were just coasting, that is exactly what we were doing.' Charlize Theron also revealed that she wasn't in the 'in crowd' at school. The Oscar-winning South African actress - who was a muse for John Galliano and has modelled for Christian Dior - told Collider: 'I was pretty much a mess out of primary school. I wasn't really in the popular crowd. 'I wore really nerdy glasses. I was blind as could be, and boys don't really like big nerdy glasses. 'There was a really popular girl at my school, and I was obsessed with her... I'm so embarrassed to say this, but I was in tears one day, because I couldn't sit next to her.' Prof Paechter told Mail Online: 'I was bullied at school at times, but at others times I wasn't one of those people who would modify my uniform to look cool. 'Because my friends and i weren't cool, the whole aspect of how you look just wasn't important to us. Swanlike: Charlize Theron has said she was not not popular at school because of her 'nerdy glasses' 'We found once school in particular in which there was a group of 10- and 11-year-olds who described themselves as the ""Mean Girls"". 'There was constant observation of who you were talking to, what you looked like. 'It was so easy to get excluded - one girl came in to school and was told she had failed the ""friendship test"". She had no idea what that was. 'On another occasion a teacher found some sellotape stuck deeply into a girl's hair. She said she could tell from the look on that pupil's face that she was wondering, ""who put that there?"".'' Helen Wright, president of the Girls' Schools Association, told Mail Online that allowing cliques to 'go unchecked' meant 'setting girl against girl in the wider community. 'People have this myth that people in these high profile groups are more respected. 'They look at celebrities as the ideal. We believe it is important to ground people and teach them to value themselves.' The terms of a cliquey friendship group can change overnight, explains the professor. Makeover: Julia Roberts admitted she was not popular at school - but now she is one of the most famous actresses in the world . The . girls who seem most socially successful can therefore be most at risk . of developing emotional or psychological problems, and teachers should . react quickly to signs of issues. Professor . Paechter's research appears to undermine the idea espoused by famous . teenage films including Clueless, She's All That or Carrie that . unpopular pupils are the unhappiest. In middle-class families, she said, it’s not just . about doing well at school but about being all-rounders. There is often also pressure to excel at sport, music as well as being top of the class. Schools emphasise that to stand out from the . crowd they must be exemplary human beings as well as doing well . at GCSEs and A levels. Professor Paechter said schools need to support success while . reducing what can seem to be a constant pressure to be the best. Pupils should be encouraged to become aspirational without being . perfectionists.","Girls at the top of the 'pecking order' can have the worst problems, she says .

Germans are in fear of a return to the urban terror days of the Red Army Faction after leftists tried to blow up a railway station and derail high-speed express trains. Explosives experts yesterday removed seven petrol bombs equipped with time detonators found by a railway worker in a tunnel leading into Berlin's central station. A left-wing group calling itself Hekla claimed responsibility for the firebombs in an online statement. Terror: The entrance of the Hauptbahnhof, Berlin's main train station. Bottles with flammable liquids were found in a tunnel leading to the station . The group condemned the German army's mission in Afghanistan and demanded the release of imprisoned US soldier Bradley Manning, who is accused of having leaked information to WikiLeaks. The discovery followed an arson attack . on signalling equipment along a line heading towards Hamburg which . caused severe delays to the mainline service between the two cities. The attacks have German politicians and police warning of a resurgence of the kind of left-wing terrorist that plagued West Germany 40 years ago. Already this year 600 expensive cars have been torched in the city by anarchists. Now . the foiled bomb attacks indicate a ratcheting up of the campaign that, . say police, will result in deaths unless they can be contained. Investigation: German policemen from a crime scene unit collect evidence from the scene where the firebombs were found. A left wing group called Hekla has claimed responsibility for planting the bombs . 'We are experience a Renaissance of the Red Army Faction. The leftist terror is on the rise,' said Rainer Wendt, the chief of the German Police Union. The Red Army Faction (RAF) - which grew out of the Baader-Meinhof terrorist clique - shot, bombed, kidnapped and terrorised West Germany in the Seventies. The group targeted numerous establishment figures in their bid to overthrow the state. While the old structures of the RAF have long atrophied, Wendt warned: 'The new terrorist groups are decentralised, loosely affiliated with many individual small groups.' This makes it harder to catch them when individuals know nothing of activists outside their own small cells, he added. Fears: A cameraman films the tracks where the incendiary devices were found. The discovery has raised fears of a resurgence of left wing terror groups . The Red Army Faction (in German: Rote Armee Fraktion) was one of Germany's most violent and prolific left-wing terror groups. Describing itself as a communist and anti-imperialist 'urban guerilla' outfit, the group engaged in armed resistance against what they deemed to be the fascist West German state. With roots in the student protest movement of the Sixties, the RAF was formed in 1970 by Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, Horst Mahler, and Ulrike Meinhof. Though it always called itself the RAF, the group was popularly known as the Baader-Meinhof Gang, after the two most prominent of its founding members. Between 1970 and 1988 the RAF was involved in various terrorist operations across West Germany. They fought what they called an 'anti-imperialist struggle' with bank robberies to raise money, kidnappings, and bomb attacks against U.S. military facilities, German police stations, and buildings belonging to newspaper organisations. It was held responsible for 34 deaths and many more injuries in its 30 years of activity, but nevertheless enjoyed a measure of public support that violent leftists in the U.S., like the Weathermen, were never able to drum up. On 20 April 1998, an eight-page typewritten letter in German was faxed to the Reuters news agency, signed 'RAF' with the group's machine-gun red star logo, declaring that the group had dissolved. Fuelled by a hatred of banks, recruiting young people with no hope of a job, these new radicals are now under the observation of intelligence services in Germany as fears grow of escalating violence. This year numerous police vehicles have been torched in Berlin and the neighbouring state of Brandenburg. Günter Krings, a domestic security expert with the government, believes it is 'premature' to talk of a return to the carnage of the RAF. But he admitted: 'We have to take these attacks very, very seriously. We cannot dismiss them as merely attacks against objects. 'Attacks against things can suddenly change into attacks on human beings. The fire on the railway line obviously endangered peoples' lives.' Uwe Schünemann, the interior minister for the state of Lower Saxony, said; 'The leftists are putting out propaganda on the internet detailing where the weak spots are in police body armour in order to wound officers. They are targeting police vehicles to set ablaze. 'They even have tips on how to attack police officers. We are in the preliminary stages of a new wave of leftist terror. 'I see parallels between the situation today and the start of the RAF. With them it started with fires and then later, people were being murdered. Therefore I say: resist the beginning.' The Office for the Protection of the Constitution also warned in a report in July of the rise of leftist violence stating: 'The attacks by left-wing extremists exhibit a significantly increased aggressiveness and willingness to take risks.'","Leftist group claims responsibility for the firebombs in online statement .

A teenage show jumper died in a freak accident after she was head-butted by her own horse during a competition, an inquest heard. A-Level student Ella Pallister was knocked unconscious when her horse refused to jump a fence and 'pecked', suddenly lifting its head and striking her in the face. She then fell off the back of the animal, named Cocoon II, and apparently hit her head on the jump. Accident: Ella Pallister died when she was struck in the head by her horse Cocoon II during a competition . Hobby: The teenager was a keen show jumper who hoped to compete in the Olympics one day . As her leg was still stuck in the stirrup, she was dragged along the ground by her beloved horse for a short while. Ella, 17, was rushed to hospital after the horrific accident at the Kingston Maurward Equestrian Centre in Dorchester, Dorset on January 27, and was later transferred to a specialist unit at Southampton Hospital. However, doctors were unable to save her and she died three days later. Hayley Greening of Dorset Police conducted an investigation into the accident, which took place in the practice arena during a show-jumping contest. She told the inquest in Dorchester yesterday that the teenager had jumped over the practice fences multiple times and was about to take part in the competition itself. Tribute: Dozens of riders turned out on their horses to remember Ella at her funeral in February . Touching: Villagers lined the streets of Portesham to watch the funeral procession for the 17-year-old . 'In my view Ella was a keen and talented rider,' Ms Greening said. 'It seems the horse refused the jump. The horse's head went down low, pulling Ella forward out of the saddle.' The animal then 'pecked, whereby it lifted its head up and backwards suddenly, striking Ella's forehead'. The officer continued: 'She fell in an unusual position and her left foot stuck in the stirrup, which would have been unlikely had she been responsive. 'The horse stood still before walking, trotting and cantering a short distance. The way she was dragged suggested to me she was not responsive. 'The horse then kicked out, Ella's foot came out of the stirrup and she lay on the ground. This was a tragic and unavoidable accident.' Missed: Ella's father said he and her mother were 'very proud of her' and 'miss her very badly' Dorset coroner Sheriff Payne recorded a verdict of accidental death, saying: 'In this case, as always, it is tragic that a young girl her age came to grief following a sport she loved.' After the inquest, Ella's father Ted Pallister said: 'Her mum and I were very proud of her, we miss her very badly. 'I would hope this is something that never happens to anyone else.' Ella had been studying for business studies and PE A-Levels at school, as well as for a BTEC National Diploma in Animal Science at Kingston Maurwood College. She was part of the Thomas Hardy School horse riding team which recently competed at the National School Equestrian Association's national showjumping finals, and hoped to compete at the Olympics one day. Ella lived with her parents - who run an indoor riding school - and her younger sister in the village of Portesham, near Weymouth.","Ella Pallister's horse 'pecked' and hit her head, knocking her unconscious .
