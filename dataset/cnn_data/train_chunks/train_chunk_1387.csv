"Last year it was all about the ramen burger. But one month into 2015 and New York already has a new It sandwich. M. Wells Dinette, the French-Canadian restaurant at MoMA's PS1 outpost in Long Island City, has been selling up to 100 of its $13 spaghetti sandwiches per day since it was listed on the menu a week ago. The dish sees spaghetti in a tomato-garlic sauce take the place of a patty. The noodles are mixed with pecorino cheese then coated in egg and baked in a blini pan to hold them together. Scroll down for video . The new ramen burger? M. Wells Dinette, in New York's Long Island City, has been selling up to 100 of its $13 spaghetti sandwiches per day since it was listed on the menu a week ago . 'The result is crispy on the outside, and very juicy on the inside,' chef Aidan O'Neal told the New York Post. 'We serve it on a toasted onion roll with extremely delicious garlic butter and a layer of chopped Caesar salad with red pepper flakes.' Of course, this is no diet food. Carb-loading aside, the spaghetti sandwich packs a punch in terms of calories too. A member of staff at the restaurant told us that they try to fit as much  between the bread as possible. This equates to around an appetizer-sized portion of pasta (420 calories according to Calorieking.com) and the same of salad (204 calories). Add the bun (150 calories), pecorino (20 calories) a generous lick of garlic butter (102 calories) and a side of potato chips (160 calories) and the total calories are a shade over 1,000. The concept of the spaghetti sandwich is not actually a new one. The brainchild of restaurant owner Hugue Dufour, it was originally listed on the menu four years ago - much to the chefs' disdain. 'We cooks all kind of scoffed at the idea,' Mr O'Neal told the Post. 'But he was right; it's very, very good.' The spaghetti sandwich fell off the menu a year ago after the restaurant decided to focus more on seasonal ingredients, but following a surge of complaints from regulars, it was reinstated last month. Carb-on-carb-on-carb: The spaghetti patty is served on an onion bun with garlic butter and Caesar salad with homemade potato chips and pickles on the side . And the demand has been unprecedented, Mr O'Neal says: 'It's been insane. We'll get get a ticket to fire up seven at a time for one table, and then another will come in, and another.' In the interests of research, the Femail team took a trip to Long Island City in order to put the sandwich to the test. A little wary of the heavy carb-on-carb action, we figured one sandwich between two would suffice. In fact, it turned out to be carb-on-carb-on-carb as the sandwich was served with homemade potato chips. But one bite in and we were both sold. The combination of textures made perfect sense in reality, if not in concept. Back by popular demand: The spaghetti sandwich fell off the menu a year ago after the restaurant decided to focus more on seasonal ingredients, but following a surge of complaints, it was reinstated last month . 'It was so much tastier than I was expecting,' said Charlie Lankston, Femail's U.S. Assistant Editor. 'And it wasn't anywhere near as ""carby"" as I thought it would be either. The tomato sauce was delicious, and the tangy Caesar dressing really helped to cut through the carbs while adding an extra flavor dimension to the overall taste.' Daters beware though - the spaghetti sandwich is is not a first date dish. 'Maybe save it for the third?' Charlie suggested. 'It was incredibly messy to eat, but well worth the tomato stains on my cheeks - and something I would actually eat again.'","M.

"They began working at the Lindt Cafe at the same time and were close friends but Paolo Vassallo knew he had to leave Tori Johnson behind, if he ever hoped to see his family again. On the 60 Minutes Sydney Siege Special, to go to air on Sunday night at 7pm, the 36-year-old father of two tells Liz Hayes, the prospect of never seeing his wife and two children spurred him into action. He left home early that Monday morning when everyone was still asleep. 'I didn't say bye to anyone,' Mr Vassallo recounted. Scroll down for videos . Paolo Vassallo started working for Lindt Chocolate Cafe in Sydney's Martin Place the same week as manager Tori Johnson. He made the decision to run for his life after the first two hostages escaped . Mr Vassallo started at the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in October 2012, the same week as manager Tori Johnson. But when John O'Brien and Stefan Balafoutis made their move, he made a decision to be next should the opportunity present itself and did it 'knowing that you could possibly never see them (his family) again'. He has two children, one aged three and another just six months old. The fear set in almost immediately, he tells Liz Hayes, when gunman Man Monis ordered Mr Johnson to lock the front door. 'This gun just came out from nowhere, ""I will shoot someone"" he said, I will do it,' said the kitchen supervisor. 'We were all scared, everyone was scared.' Scroll down for more videos . While his co-worker was one of the first to escape, Joel Herat, 21, was one of the last. He followed his mate Jarrod Morton-Hoffman, 19, and three others, in making a run for it at about 2.03am on Tuesday. 'Running, just running for our lives,' he revealed. But with their attempted escape came the risk of being gunned down. 'As we were running he came running out and started shooting at us,' Mr Herat said. 'The spray of the bullets just went everywhere.' 'Running, just running for our lives' said Joel Herat (front). He tells 60 Minutes how the gunman started shooting at them as they made the break for freedom . 'They're your family, I just wanted everyone to get out' Joel Herat breaks down during the 60 Minutes interview as he remembers the final minutes of the Sydney siege . Once out of harm's way, his thoughts turned to those who were still trapped inside, include more co-workers. 'They're your family, you see them every day. I just wanted everyone to get out.' 60 Minutes will air the Sydney Siege Special on Sunday at 7pm after its nightly news. However, in another twist in the battle for ratings supremacy, the Seven Network has flagged an unprecedented step, dispensing with its 6pm news bulletin in favour of an early start to its 'Inside The Siege: The Untold Story'. Tori Johnson (left) and Katrina Dawson (right) were victims of the Lindt cafe siege. Gunman Man Monis took 18 people hostage and most of the survivors have told their stories to the Nine and Seven networks in specials due to air on Sunday night . It will focus heavily on the harrowing accounts by Westpac executive Marcia Mikhael of Katrina Dawson's last living moments. She tells of looking into Ms Dawson’s eyes during the mother-of-three's fearful last moments, as the fire-fight unfolded between the crazed gunman and heavily armed police. Ms Dawson, 38, was killed when the siege reached its bloody end, struck by six fragments of police bullets. ‘Katrina and I look at each other, and you could see the fear on her face and I must have had the same fear on my face as well, because I was terrified,’ Ms Mikhael told Channel Seven. ‘And I took one last look at Katrina and she looked at me. 'Then she puts her hands on her face and she puts her face down like to protect her face. 'I kind of go into a foetal position, you know, and my legs get hit,’ Ms Mikhael said. Ms Mikhael was next to Ms Dawson, she said, facing her as they lay next to each other. When Ms Mikhael next saw Ms Dawson’s face, she wasn't moving. Ms Mikhael was shot and describes the pain as ‘agony’ but suppressed her screams, desperate to remain inconspicuous. She hoped her silence could save her from an attack by Monis, who fired his gun at police at least twice before he was killed. ‘It was just so loud, so many shots, so many,’ Ms Mikhael said of the shoot out during her interview with Channel Seven. Eighteen people were held captive by Man Monis, during the 17-hour-long siege at Martin Place on December 15. 60 Minutes will also document the revelations of Louisa Hope, who tells of the moment Monis made Mr Johnson  kneel down in front of him, before he shot him in the back of the head. Ms Hope, 50, was used as a human shield by the gunman during the 17-hour-long ordeal at Martin Place on December 15. Unable to defend herself due to her multiple sclerosis, she had to bide her time, meaning she was by his side until the very end. Ms Hope and her mother Robyn, 68, had made a visit to the cafe on the morning of the siege during their annual Christmas outing. It was the first time they had ever gone inside. Almost two months after the siege, Louisa remains in hospital recovering from her injuries. A wounded Louisa Hope is taken to an ambulance after the shoot-out inside the Lindt Cafe in the early hours of December 16 . They were on either side of siege victim Tori Johnson in his final moments. In what they thought was their final moments, the mother and daughter swore to each other that they would not leave each other. Ms Hope's comments come after an inquest into the siege  revealed the barrel of the shotgun was held just 75 centimetres from Mr Johnson's head when he was executed, prompting police to storm the Lindt cafe. Seven will also show previously unseen footage from inside the cafe, taken from their locked down newsroom across the way. it will include information about how the second escape took place, when Elly Chen and Jieun Bae managed to run free. Their escape was so silent that Monis did not even realise the young women had fled. Ms Chen, who had only worked at the café for three shifts, became so overcome with the trauma of the ordeal that she suffered a panic attack at the café. She collapsed on the ground and Monis pressed the gun to her back. Jieun Bae and Elly Chen managed to run free during the afternoon. Their escape was so silent that Monis apparently did not even realise the young women . Channel Seven reports that the hostages around her screamed and shouted in anger as Ms Chen’s fear escalated. After Ms Chen recovered, the two café workers noticed that a door in the café was locked by a latch and would allow them to flee to Martin Place. They took several minutes to silently pull the latch open and slip out into the street. The images of the young women running down the street, their faces etched with terror and anguish, beamed around the world who watched on in horror.","Lindt Cafe kitchen supervisor Paolo Vassallo reveals to 60 Minutes his agonising decision to leave his friends behind and make a run for it .

"Snow has hit this morning as Britain was warned to brace itself for Siberian gales bringing  five days of sub-zero weather and temperatures dropping to -11C. London has had its first significant snowfall of the year as flurries moved in across the South East overnight with forecasters predicting a new band of freezing cold air from northern Russia will reach the country by Thursday. There are yellow warnings of snow and ice in place  for eastern counties, the far west of Wales and Cornwall as well as Scotland, Yorkshire and the East Midlands, which will remain in place until around midday tomorrow. Parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland were hit by more snow. Scroll down for video . Snow has hit this morning as Britain, including Kingston upon Thames, pictured, was warned to brace itself for Siberian gales bringing five days of sub-zero weather and temperatures dropping to -11C . Prediction: The Met Office said parts of the UK, in Kingston left and Battersea, right, would awake to a thin carpet of snow today, with sub-zero temperatures expected for some of the country overnight. The big chill: Residents in West London woke to snow on the ground this morning as flurries moved in across the South East overnight . Freeze: Parts of the capital were under a blanket of snow with forecasters predicting a new band of freezing cold air from northern Russia will reach the country by Thursday . Arctic blast: Heavy downfalls of snow are shown here in the Ealing area of West London overnight . The Met Office said parts of the UK would awake to a thin carpet of snow today, with sub-zero temperatures expected for some of the country overnight. While some snow fell in London overnight, the coldest weather was reserved for areas which saw less snow and clearer skies. The village of Dalwhinnie in the Highlands endured -11C, and it was just a few degrees warmer in Katesbridge Co Down where the mercury plummeted to -8C (17.6F). The snow is unlikely to fall in great volumes or lie, said Met Office forecaster Kirk Waite, but he added the cold weather could bring about tricky driving conditions. 'We are not really expecting much in the way of accumulation as it will be mostly a light snowfall,' he said. 'But the cold weather will create some potentially difficult travel conditions through rush hour with a risk of icy patches.' Gritters were out in force in Hertfordshire with salting trucks already on their second run by 4.30am. Later today it will struggle to get above 6C (42.8F) in parts of England, including London, Mr Waite added. For most of the UK it is expected to stay dry with some sunny spells today while there could be the chance of some wintry showers in coastal areas and temperatures reaching zero degrees in Scotland and 4C in the South, according to the Met Office. The cold front will move eastwards tomorrow, with the eastern coasts of Scotland and England still seeing snow showers as well as a strong northeasterly wind. Higher ground in the North York Moors and Lincolnshire Wolds could see up to 3.9ins (10cm) of snow, according to the Met Office, with a yellow 'be aware' warning remaining in place throughout the day. Snow in Scotland and Northern Ireland will gradually die out on Tuesday with some snow showers expected to affect parts of the east coast of England -and even London could see a dusting - as conditions remain cold for the rest of the week. Winds will gradually increase and become strong in the south as the first gusts from Eastern Europe start to sweep in, with the potential of some snow flurries in London.

Cold start: The rowers wrapped up warm for their early morning jaunt on the River Cam as they practiced on the river despite chilly conditions . Siberian gales: This weather map shows a band of high-altitude cold air (blue area) expected to sweep across the UK this week from Russia . Met Office forecaster Laura Young said: 'Nights are forecast to be -11C in Scotland and -5C in England. The south east could certainly see 1-2cm on higher ground including the Chilterns and North Downs. London has the potential for a dusting. 'An easterly flow with air coming from Siberia and Russia will be going right across the southern half of the UK ahead of the weekend. 'It will feel very cold, with days at 3C to 4C days but feeling colder in the wind. 'The North will have a less cold north-westerly flow, which is expected to replace the South's easterlies into next week - although the pattern is expected to flip back at easterlies at times ahead.' Meteorologist, Mark Wilson, added: 'The weather will quieten down after Wednesday and be drier, but it will stay cold.' Forecaster Brian Gaze of The Weather Outlook said: 'Bitterly cold easterly air is due from the continent, with large area of high pressure drawing in some very cold air from Russia, blocking milder westerly Atlantic systems and making the UK cold.'

"Gordon Brown has promised that Labour will go even further in handing new powers to Scotland - including more generous benefits. Hitting the General Election campaign trail the former Prime Minister pledged that the Scottish parliament will have the final say on welfare and not Westminster. Mr Brown - who plans to stand down as an MP in May - said a Labour Government will go further on devolving power to the Edinburgh government than previously promised. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown (left) - with the party's Scottish leader Jim Murphy - has promised Scots higher benefits if they vote Labour . The party will end UK-wide benefit rates, making it possible for the Scottish government to promise top-up payments to people north of the border. The extra money would have to be raised in Scotland, but the plan is certain to spark a fresh row about the promise of more money. Mr Brown declared: 'We will maintain the security of the UK benefits system, with UK benefit rates, underpinned by the pooling and sharing of resources across the UK. 'But we will go further by ensuring that the final say on benefit levels remains in Scotland by giving the Scottish parliament a wider power to top up UK benefits. 'This will ensure that Scotland is protected from Tory welfare cuts - there could never be another bedroom tax in Scotland - and from benefit cuts caused by a fall in Scottish funding due to, for example, the collapse in the oil price.' He argued Scotland should be able to make 'different choices' about the size of benefit payments. 'We will go further by ensuring that the Scottish parliament has the power to introduce new benefits, funded from Scotland, to meet different circumstances and different choices we make in Scotland.' But the move was condemned by the Tories, who warned it would leader to higher taxes and higher spending. Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives,said: 'Scotland's economy is on the road to recovery with welfare changes meaning thousands more Scots are in work. 'But Gordon Brown is yanking the Labour party back to the bad old days of high tax, high spending and high borrowing that crashed the economy in the first place. 'Most Scots understand that it's better to have a job and be bringing home a wage to your family than to be parked on welfare under the Labour state.' Mr Brown outlined more welfare powers for Scotland in a speech to Labour supporters in Edinburgh today . The former party leader was  instrumental in winning last year's independence referendum after making a series of speeches towards the end of the campaign . Mr Brown used his speech to set out a raft of new Labour pledges designed to prevent wipeout at the hands of the SNP. He added: 'While the Tories cut welfare and the SNP cut colleges, we would bring employment and welfare policy together with a positive vision for tackling the low skills, numeracy and literacy problems that hold back adults trapped in long-term unemployment. 'The fourth area where we will go further is in housing benefit. We will fully devolve the housing benefit. A massive £1.8billion in housing benefit is spent in Scotland every year. 'This is a huge sum that should be used not to indefinitely subsidise the private rented sector but to invest in new housing in Scotland. 'The fifth and final area we will go further in is in devolving welfare to local communities.' The speech in Edinburgh today is part of a Labour fightback following polls that have indicated the SNP could win more than 50 seats in May. However, SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie hit out yesterday: 'This is absolutely farcical from Labour. 'Having claimed authorship of the Vow, declared it delivered and called for everyone to move on from the debate, they are now admitting that what is on offer is woefully inadequate and scrambling around trying to make it sound more substantial. 'The sheer panic setting in at the heart of Scottish Labour is palpable.' Meanwhile, the party's election chief has warned the party will not jeopardise the nation's safety by abolishing Trident. Mr Brown will hit the General Election campaign trail with Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy, who has been tasked with getting Ed Miliband into Number 10 . Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander said he would not do a deal on defending the UK. But former First Minister Alex Salmond said that scrapping Trident would have a lot of support across Britain. Mr Salmond told the Murnaghan programme on Sky News that the SNP also wanted the cancellation of the Trident nuclear deterrent 'instead of another bout of austerity from Labour or Conservative'. He added: 'Diverting that funding, £30billion over the next ten years, into health and education and something useful and productive, I think that will have a lot of support in England as well as in Scotland.' Mr Salmond also said that Ed Miliband had managed the 'remarkable achievement' of becoming 'even more unpopular than David Cameron' in Scotland after the referendum. He said a formal deal with Labour after the General Election was unlikely but 'possible'.","Former Prime Minister returns to the frontline ahead of general election .
Brown will promise Scotland can make 'different choices' about benefits .
Plan is likely to spark a fresh row about the promises made to Scotland .
It goes further than the 'Vow' made to devolve powers before referendum ."
"Sending billions in aid to poor countries is not always the most 'appropriate' way for the UK to help them, MPs warn. The number of recipient states in dire need is falling and sending handouts to rapidly growing economies such as India is no longer a 'sufficient response', they say. In a report published today, MPs call for reform to Britain's overseas aid programme, saying taxpayers' money would be better spent on 'co-operation'. Sending billions in aid to poor countries is not always the most 'appropriate' way for the UK to help, according to MPs (pictured relief goods are unloaded in Pakistan) Efforts should be diverted to 'beyond aid' projects – using UK expertise to encourage trade and helping to overhaul tax collection and public services such as health, schools and the justice systems. The document, compiled by a cross-party group of MPs on the Commons international development committee, follows official figures that show the number of 'priority countries' has fallen from 28 to 22. Although the report endorses the much-criticised target to allocate 0.7 per cent of Britain's GDP to poor countries, it calls for a 'new approach'. Tanzania and Kenya (pictured), should be moving to 'beyond aid' programmes within five years, according to Jeremy Lefroy, a Tory MP on the committee . It says: 'The nature of international development is changing... aid remains essential for poor countries, and for some purposes in middle income countries. 'However overall, a new approach is needed which reflects the changing situation. As grants of aid become less appropriate in some countries, so new forms of development co-operation are necessary.' The committee said aid remained vital for 'fragile' countries fighting infectious diseases such as ebola or those embroiled in conflict or humanitarian crises. But it called for more focus on 'beyond aid' policies that address the underlying causes of poverty, a 'modest' investment in which has an impact 'much larger than can be brought about through aid'. Such a move would benefit UK households, who pay about £430 a year towards overseas aid to countries including India – which last year received £169million despite having its own space programme. Jeremy Lefroy, a Tory MP on the committee, said aid recipients such as Tanzania and Kenya, should be moving to 'beyond aid' programmes within five years. He added: 'DfID must make sure that countries which no longer require our cash are instead benefiting from British expertise and helped to run their own public services.' Committee chairman Sir Malcolm Bruce said aid has a role to play in 'building new partnerships' with emergent countries like India, China and Brazil. 'However the number of poor countries is falling, and those that remain often suffer from conflict, so need multiple interventions... that is why development in the future will not just be about aid,' he said. The Department for International Development backed the committee's findings and said the Government needs to 'find new ways of working with emerging powers'. A spokesman said it has already diverted funds away from traditional aid 'with the aim of ending aid dependency once and for all'. Many Tory MPs oppose the 0.7 per cent target and its link to GDP – national wealth – which led to an extra £1billion in aid added last year because of better than expected economic growth.","MPs are calling for reform to Britain's overseas aid programme in a report .

"A young girl has been left with a badly burnt face which could see her scarred for the rest of her life after an accident at her local market at the weekend. Belinda Campos, from Lilyfield in Sydney's inner-west, goes to the Orange Grove Markets every Saturday morning with her husband and daughter Gracie, who is almost three. But on Saturday while Ms Campos was visiting a different stall to usual Gracie decided to take a peek in a pie warmer that was sitting at the front of the stall on a trestle table. 'My daughter was literally standing right next to me and I turned around and she had started screaming,' Ms Campos told Daily Mail Australia. On Saturday Belinda Campos had to rush her daughter Gracie (pictured) to emergency after she suffered burns to her chin . 'She basically looked at the pie, went in for a closer look and burnt her chin,' she continued. 'I asked the guy at the stall if this is hot and he sort of looked past me and went to serve the next customer.' Ms Campos grabbed her daughter and headed home as soon as the accident happened, before calling a close friend who works as a nurse for advice. After rushing to the emergency department at Balmain Hospital, she spent the next few hours there with her young daughter with cold presses on her chin as doctors tried to examine the damage. 'It blistered up really quickly and it has been weeping,' Ms Campos revealed. Sharing her story as a caution for other parents out there, the Lilyfield mother is now looking for answers. Ms Campos said Gracie has not been herself since the accident and also missed out on her first ever swimming lesson which was supposed to take place later on Saturday. Gracie, 3, burnt her face on a pie-warmer at the Orange Grove Markets in Lilyfield in Sydney's inner-west . She spent hours in emergency and could be scarred for the rest of her life . 'You know she's not herself, she's quite an active child but she's just been laying on the couch,' Ms Campos said. 'Until the new skin grows through we've got to be really careful.' Gracie may have permanent scar from the burn, but will be unable to tell for at least the next few months until her face completely heals. 'When fresh skin comes through it's going to be lighter than her olive skin... we wont know for a few months if it will scar permanently,' Ms Campos said. The mother has been in contact with the market organisers - Organic Food Markets - who said while they try and keep an eye on all stall-holders they do not carry out extensive checks each week. 'It's a collaborative process', Steven Choularton, Director Organic Food Markets told Daily Mail Australia. Pictured is the pie warmer which Gracie burnt her chin on at the weekend . Her mother Belinda Campos has contacted the market organisers and the council looking for answers . 'We regret any child being hurt and although it was not something we did directly, we will make every effort to prevent it happening again,' he continued. Mr Choularton has been in contact with the owner of the stall where the incident took place, and said a number of suggestions have been put forward to the stall-holder so that another similar incident can be prevented. Those guidelines were that a sign should be stuck to the pie-warmer to notify people it is hot, although the admitted this would not have helped in this particular case. Another was to 'move it (the pie-warmer) deeper into the gazebo so it was out of the way', and the third was to 'make a wooden skirt' around the over so it couldn't be touched. Mr Choularton also suggested that if people see something out of order they notify market stall holders or authorities. 'Wherever you are no matter how safe or dangerous it's important to keep your eyes open for hazards,' he said. Ms Campos hopes her daughter will heal in the coming months, and is working to ensure the same thing doesn't happen to anyone else . Ms Campos said she was shocked at how quickly it happened and wants to prevent it from happening to others. 'I just didn't think to be honest people would have oven that hot so low, I just assumed it would be warm,' she said. 'I can't believe it, I felt so bad because she was just standing right next to me.' Ms Campos has also contacted Leichhardt Council 'to guarantee that this isn't going to happen again to anyone else.' 'People do need to be aware, at the Orange Grove Markets there's just kids everywhere. 'It's a kids market so it needs to be safe,' Ms Campos continued.","Belinda Campos and her family visit Orange Grove Markets in Sydney's inner-west every weekend .

"A completely new type of fundamental particle may explain the mystery of 'dark matter', the missing material that makes up more than 80 per cent of the universe's mass, according to British scientists. Researchers at the University of Southampton believe the nature of their hypothetical particle may be the reason why no-one has yet managed to detect dark matter directly. Dark matter reveals itself to astronomers in the way its gravity affects stars and galaxies, helping to bind them together and give the universe structure. Scroll down for video . University of Southampton researchers have proposed a hypothetical fundamental particle for dark matter (illustrated). It has a mass only about 0.02 per cent that of an electron - making it extremely 'light'. This would make it unable to pass through Earth's atmosphere - so Earth-based detectors would  not be able to detect it . Its imprint can also be seen in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the 'afterglow' of the Big Bang. But despite extensive efforts the mysterious material has never been directly observed. The new research suggests one reason for this may be that dark matter particles are much lighter than has previously been proposed. When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing. From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the universe. The hypothetical particle has a mass only about 0.02 per cent that of an electron. While it does not interact with light, it interacts surprisingly strongly with normal matter, and may not even be able to penetrate the Earth's atmosphere. If this is the case, dark matter particles are unlikely to be spotted by Earth-bound detectors. 'This work brings together some very different areas of physics: theoretical particle physics, observational X-ray astronomy, and experimental quantum optics,' said Dr James Bateman, from the department of physics and astronomy at the University of Southampton. 'Our candidate particle sounds crazy, but currently there seem to be no experiments or observations which could rule it out. 'Dark matter is one of the most important unsolved problems in modern physics, and we hope that our suggestion will inspire others to develop detailed particle theory and even experimental tests.' The team, whose findings are published in the journal Scientific Reports, hope to incorporate a search for the new particle into a space experiment with which it is already involved. Maqro (Macroscopic Quantum Resonators) will aim to test quantum phenomena - the weird behaviour of subatomic particles - at larger scales. As part of the experiment, a nanoparticle suspended in space will be used to see if its position is altered by the flow of dark matter. The researchers plan to perform an experiment in space to find out if they can detect dark matter. Maqro (Macroscopic Quantum Resonators) will aim to test  the weird behaviour of subatomic particles at a larger scale. A nanoparticle will be suspended in space to see if dark matter alters its position (illustrated) 'At the moment, experiments on dark matter do not point into a clear direction and, given that also the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Cern has not found any signs of new physics yet, it may be time that we shift our paradigm towards alternative candidates for dark matter,' said co-author Dr Alexander Merle, from the Max Planck Institute in Munich, Germany. 'More and more particle physicists seem to think this way, and our proposal seems to be a serious competitor on the market.' Scientists believe dark matter makes up 26.8 per cent of the combined mass-energy of the universe. Normal matter accounts for 4.9 per cent and the even more mysterious 'dark energy' 26.8 per cent. In terms of mass alone, dark matter is thought to make up 84.5 per cent of the the universe.","University of Southampton researchers have proposed a hypothetical fundamental particle for dark matter .
It has a mass only about 0.02 per cent that of an electron - making it extremely 'light'
This would make it unable to pass through Earth's atmosphere .
In turn, Earth-based detectors would therefore not be able to detect it .
This could explain why dark matter has not yet been found .

"Deep within a Cumbrian fell, my head torch flickers as I cling to a rock, heart in mouth. Taking a deep breath, I launch myself into Honister Slate Mine’s newly opened climbing experience, near Keswick. It is an underground version of their celebrated Via Ferrata, where willing victims are clamped to the cliff face. But this is an all-weather sport, as the mine maintains a constant temperature of 11C all year round. Scroll down for video . Down and in: Honister Slate Mine has been repurposed as a venue for action and adventure in Cumbria . Harnessed and helmeted, I follow my guide Joe Weir for 90 minutes through a maze of trails - including dizzying crawls on iron-rung ladders and tiptoes across tight-rope bridges. Metal footholds and cables have been hammered into the walls of vast caverns - blasted open for their precious green slate throughout the centuries. First mined by the Romans, Honister is Britain’s last working slate mine, with 11 miles of tunnels chipped into the 2,126 ft- high Fleetwith Pike, and more still being discovered. Hold on tightly: Visitors can clamber through an underground world that was mined by the Romans . The section that forms the Climb The Mine experience was last worked in 1966 and everywhere you notice the rusting remnants of its past - from old pulleys to decayed pipes. The beam from my head torch picks up a spade, flung on the ground as though its owner had just popped out for a tea break. Low tunnels link the three main climbing caverns, most with tracks running through them on the ground. ‘You’d never be standing upright inside the tunnels,’ Joe says, his words echoing as we duck down. ‘You’d always be stooped from the effort of pushing a cart full of slate out of the mine on these tracks.’ On track: The defunct mine makes for one of Britain's more imaginative venues for a thrilling day out . Mining has a long tradition in Joe’s family - his uncle and grandfather were rivers, splitting blocks of green slate into thin sheets that could then be shaped into everything from roof tiles to headstones. As mine manager, Joe now oversees the blasts - but he also finds peace inside the impossibly black caves, silent but for the occasional drip of water. ‘Sometimes I go deep in the tunnels, turn my torch off and see if I can find my way out using the breeze from the entrance,’ he says. On the outside: Honister Slate Mine is located within glorious Lake District scenery . I soon see what he means as the cold air stings my face the closer we get to one of the mine’s exits, emerging to a dramatic mountain pass view with rugged grey cliffs unfurling beneath us. I’m thankful to be back on terra firma at Scafell Hotel, a former country house in nearby Borrowdale and reward my efforts with a steak and cheese board served, fittingly, on Honister slate.

"Free banking in Britain will be 'dead within a decade' and customers instead asked to pay American-style charges of around £10 per month, experts said today. Those who refuse to pay for using their current account would face restrictions on withdrawals and using branches, a leading firm of consultants has claimed. PriceWaterHouseCooper's report says offering free accounts is becoming 'unsustainable' and increases the risk of future mis-selling scandals. Steve Davies, the retail banking leader at PwC, also said that paying for current accounts as standard could smash the control the big banks have on the UK market. Many experts say free banking is a 'dangerous myth' bankrolled by overdraft fees and rock-bottom interest rates. End of an era: The practice of offering free bank accounts in Britain could come to an end within ten years, according to a report . Most major banks in Britain such as Lloyds and Barclays offer free banking alongside paid-for accounts providing perks such as travel and mobile phone insurance. But the policy remains controversial and some politicians, regulators and bankers have called for it to end, so banks do not attempt to squeeze profits from customers elsewhere. They say ending it would make charges more transparent and improve competition and levels of service. Steve Davies, retail banking leader at PwC, said current accounts were not as free as they seemed. 'UK current accounts are not free at all and are paid for through overdraft charges, penalty fees and uncompetitive or zero rates of interest,' he said. 'The free banking model stifles innovation and competition,' Mr Davies added. Andrew Bailey, head of the Prudential Regulation Authority at the Bank of England (pictured), has called free banking a 'dangerous myth' Millions of customers are paying £400 or more a year in unnecessary overdraft fees because Britain's biggest banks make it too hard  to compare charges, it emerged recently. Alex Chisholm, pictured, head of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), said in November that customers 'cannot be bothered' to move banks because it is too difficult to work out if they will be better off. The CMA has  launched a major investigation to challenge the stranglehold of Britain's big four banks on the finances of families and small businesses. The CMA is concerned that customers are being misled by the finance giants, which promote their services as ‘free banking’. Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC are accused of controlling 77 per cent of the nation’s 65million personal accounts but offering poor service and rip-off deals. The Competition & Markets Authority says not enough customers are shifting to lenders with high levels of service, reducing choice in the market. According to the Daily Telegraph, he claimed free accounts could disappear 'most likely within a decade'. 'It requires new challenger banks to achieve scale very quickly if they are to survive and it fails to reward banks that come up with new ideas as costs cannot be recovered,' he said. Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC are accused of controlling 77 per cent of the nation’s 65million personal accounts but offering poor service and rip-off deals. The report, based on a survey of over 2,000 people, showed a majority were aware accounts appearing free can carry hidden charges. However, one in two said they would be likely to change banks if an upfront fee was introduced instead. Nearly two-thirds said they were not prepared to pay anything up front and 27 percent said they would not pay more than £10 a month. The issue is already being looked at by Britain's competition watchdog, which is considering whether banks should charge customers for holding their personal current accounts as part of a wider inquiry into the industry. Andrew Bailey, head of the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority, has called free banking a 'dangerous myth', while some senior bankers also want it to end. However, the boss of Lloyds, Britain's biggest retail bank, said in November free banking should remain and authorities should not impose charges as part of attempts to shake up the market. Many banks in the US, Canada, parts of Europe and Australia charge monthly fees for their services. Banks in France charge a management fee of €10 (£7.80) for every three months – €40 a year. On top of that, there is typically an annual fee of around €40 for a debit card, or €45 for a credit card that can be used overseas. French banks also charge €1 a month for five text messages giving balance details. A bank might charge €60 to allow a customer to have a long-term authorised overdraft, although the interest rates are capped at relatively low levels. In the US, the Bank of America has a standard fee of $12 (£7.50) a month – $144 a year – for those who do not have a minimum balance of $1,500. There is also a fee of $2.50 for cash withdrawals from machines not owned by the bank. On top of that, overdraft charges can be extremely high, with a fee of up to $35 for every payment that is bounced.","Practice of offering free bank accounts could end by 2025, report claims .

"He has been painted by history as the worst monarch to have ever lorded over the country. But thanks to a ‘medieval tape recorder’ King John is now been able to make his case from beyond the grave. The monarch, who ruled from 1199 until 1216, was the first British ruler to keep copies of his correspondence for posterity. King John, who endorsed the Magna Carta in 1215 is viewed as the worst monarch to have reigned . And these thousands of documents, all written or dictated by the King himself, have allowed his voice to travel through the centuries. The letters are examined in a new BBC documentary, The Last Journey of the Magna Carta King, and experts claim they call into question the view of John as a tyrannical ruler – although are not able to dispel it completely. Professor Stephen Church, who co-presents the programme, said: ‘I think they do paint a more human figure. They paint the picture of a man who is energetic, who is enthusiastic, who is an optimist – he really does believe he can move mountains and can make him happen. ‘But they also show the King John we might recognise more easily, a man who is capricious, who you might even think of as vicious sometimes. 'You get a sense of the threatening John as well as he threatens to confiscate your property and demands you can and see him if you value your life. It gives you a really interesting insight into him.’ Although these documents have been known to exist for a long time, they have been often neglected as a source of historical study and Professor Church believes much more can still be learned from them. In the BBC 1 documentary 'The Last Journey of the Magna Carta King'  the dramatic last days of King John, famous for the creation of the Magna Carta, are retraced . Dr Ben Robinson, who also hosts the documentary which broadcasts tonight, described them ‘as close as we get to a medieval tape recording.’ While other monarchs before John were also prolific letter writers, his are the only correspondence to have survived the centuries, as he ordered copies to be made of every letter he ever sent. Professor Church explained: ‘Most of those letters just disappeared, parchment was pretty valuable stuff, so people often reused it or if not they got rid of it. Although we know John’s brother and father both wrote lots of these letters, we have virtually none that have survived. ‘It’s like your outbox from your email, if you’re not recording what’s going out when you send something then whether it survives or not depends on whether they person you are sending it to keeps it. What’s happening for the first time in John’s reign is that they King has his own sent folder, copies are being kept of the thousands of letters he is sending out. ‘It reveals a huge amount about his personality but one of the most interesting things it shows is that he was a very hands-on king. You can see him not just dealing with the great matters of State – things like treaties and rebellions – but he is also involved in restocking the cellars of the various castles he stayed in as he was travelling around the countryside.’ The documentary, which broadcasts on BBC1 but only in some regions, is part of a series of programmes from the BBC marking the 800th anniversary of the signing of the Magna Carta, which was brought in under King John’s rule. The show also uses technology called Lidar to reveal, for the first time, how much the landscape of the Fenlands has changed since the days of King John. The Magna Carta (pictured) is one of the most valuable windows to the past in existence . The area, in Cambridgeshire, was the backdrop to the monarch’s final journey and, although now intensively farmed, was then a treacherous marshland. Lidar, which was originally developed by the military, maps the contours and undulations of the Earth in great detail. This data can then be broken down and analysed to reveal how the area looked, stretching back to the Neolithic period. Dr Robinson said: ‘It’s the first time we’ve seen in this amount of detail all those historic features of the Fenland region. In the past, aerial photographs have revealed a bit of the landscape at a time and you can map them with other bits of aerial photographs. But what the LIDAR does is show in great detail all the stuff as one big picture. That, we just haven’t been able to achieve before. ‘As an archaeologist who loves the Fenland region and knew the important and interest of the place, to suddenly have it depicted this way is incredible. It’s something I couldn’t have dreamt about at the start of my career. ‘Like anything else, the more that people study these images, the more you look at them, the more you see. There are lots of people working on them. The more you study the more you see and the more questions it raises. ‘Essentially, the images are showing you features that date back to the Neolithic and Bronze Age right the way through to King John’s time and then to present day. It’s an incredible window into the past of the region.’ He added that an understanding of the landscape as it once was is vital to comprehending the full picture of historical events. He said: ‘When we look at events in history we’ve got to think not just about the documents that people left behind but about the landscapes that they were living in and travelling through because that helps explain some of their actions, their motives and how they viewed the world around them and how they responded to it. 'We really need to combine the archaeological evidence with the historical documents to work out what it was really like for people at that time to deal with the world around them. ‘The world has changed but what’s most remarkable is that there are still traces of that ancient world for us to see and explore today. They are often subtle and difficult to tease out, which is why Lidar is so important because it gives you that view. ‘The landscape we have today has built up over thousands of years and still has traces of events and actions and activities that took place hundreds of thousands of years ago. That’s the joy of it, you just have to know how to interpret it. ‘But once you do that and once you walk though that ancient landscape you start to empathise a bit more with the characters and personalities that were around at that time. To walk through places King John would have known, virtually walking his footsteps, it was like sharing his last few days with him, it was a very powerful experience. ‘ . Royal approval: King John signed with a seal the Magna Carta at Runnymede, near Windsor, in June 1215 – a moment hailed as one of the most significant in English history . King John agreed the Magna Carta at Runnymede, near Windsor, in June 1215 – a moment hailed as one of the most significant in English history. Meaning 'The Great Charter', it brought an end to the unlimited power of the monarch and established the principle that everybody, including the king, was subject to the law and had the right to fair trial. It was originally meant as a peace treaty between King John and his barons, with whom he was at war. The original Magna Carta had 63 clauses. Today, only three of the original 63 clauses remain on the statute books. Of these three survivors one defends the liberties and rights of the English Church, another confirms the liberties and customs of London and other towns, and the third gives all English subjects the right to justice and a fair trial. The manuscript has a large influence on the rule of law in Britain today. It says: 'No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgement of his equals or by the law of the land. To no-one will we sell, to no-one deny or delay right or justice.' Once sealed by the king, scribes made many copies in medieval Latin, although only four are known to have survived. The Magna Carta influenced not only Thomas Jefferson when he helped draft the Declaration of Independence, but also the writers of the French constitution and the late South African leader Nelson Mandela, who cited it in his famous speech in his own defence at the Rivonia trial in 1964.","Documentary dispels myth of King John as greedy 13th century monarch .

"While pandas are often criticised as slow, lazy and maybe not the brightest of the bears, the young ones at a Chinese breeding centre are far from that, when motivated enough. In their case, the lure of milk in a neighbouring enclosure is enough to inspire a bit of extra effort from these giant pandas who manage to contort their cumbersome bodies through cell-like bars. These pieces of  footage comes from CCTV cameras behind the scenes at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. The centre is the same one that tourists can go to if they want to volunteer to be a panda keeper for the day for about £35, with a one-minute cuddle with one of the teenage bears an added bonus for £200. And for superfans of the cuddly panda, the cameras show rolling footage of the animals online. Known as PandaCam, the cameras broadcast the daily lives of the animals around the world, allowing viewers to flick between cameras in the cages of both youngsters and adults with their babies. Footage shows how curiosity gets the better of the pandas as they squeeze through the bars of neighbouring cells. The neighbouring enclosure's milk was the inspiration for this panda, who slid easily through the bars . Another panda at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding shows its contortion skills . The first clever one has no problem getting next door without the key on New Year's Day 2014, and shows how much fluff makes up its body mass while going through the metal bars. Of course, it's not so easy for some, especially if they try to go back the other way. Footage of another from December 17, 2013, is a little tough to watch given how cute the creature is as its head gets stuck. This giant panda makes the mistake of, once getting his head through the bars, attempting to retreat. Its friends on the other side first come over to help - or play, it's hard to tell - before a keeper notices the predicament and decides pulling the head through would work. It didn't. In the end, the keeper urged the panda to continue on the originally desired path and soon all the pandas were together on the same side of the bars, with the stricken one looking a bit exhausted.

Gabreski Airport  in Suffolk County, New York, were all temporarily closed due to snow on Monday. Some flights to La Guardia Airport outside of New York City were also delayed. Sky Harbor is encouraging travelers to check on their flight status ahead of time because of the weather uncertainties. Lines were moving well at TSA checkpoints as of 8.40am according to the airport's Twitter account. The airport said in a release: 'The day after Super Bowl XLIX, will be Phoenix Sky Harbor's busiest day on record with a 60 percent increase in traffic. 'An average day at Sky Harbor sees about 110,000 passengers while February 2, could see 180,000 passengers. 'Additionally, an average day sees about 1,200 takeoffs and landings at Phoenix Sky Harbor, while February 2, the airport expects approximately 1,600 takeoffs and landings.' Football fans who went to the Super Bowl are being asked to keep their game programs with their carry-on luggage because they contain metallic ink which can set off alarms during security screening for checked bags. The airport is also advising passengers to check in for their flights and print their boarding passes before coming to Sky Harbor. Sky Harbor, nicknamed America’s Friendliest Airport, is one of the ten busiest airports in the US. According to traveler Peter Carline, who was at Sky Harbor on Monday, 'a plane taking off every three minutes mean there is little Super Bowl hangover in Arizona' Leaving: Sky Harbor airport (pictured) in Arizona is expecting 80,000 passengers to depart on Monday. That is about twice the number of departures for a normal day according to the TSA . Peter Carline of London was traveling back to the UK by way of Minneapolis, Minnesota, after coming to Arizona for the Super Bowl. He told MailOnline: 'I checked in online before travelling, took the light rail to the airport and was intrigued by a sign saying 'early bag check'. 'In less than two minutes I was checked in and relieved of my heavy suitcase. I was advised to head straight to security by the staff, who were terrific. An excellent service. 'Planes were lined up on the runways as I glided over them on the efficient PHX Sky Train. 'I arrived at Terminal 4 at 11:11 and five minutes later a queue of 32 people was quickly moving into the security check area. 'By 11.21 I had passed all checks and was eyeing up food near my gate with an hour and a half to kill. 'PHX brands itself as America's friendliest airport. You could replace the adjective to efficient and it would be equally true.

The programs were printed with metallic ink . In the hours before the big game on Sunday, which saw the New England Patriots defeat the Seattle Seahawks 28-24, dense fog in Phoenix caused numerous delays and cancellations. Sky Harbor's acting aviation director, Tamie Fisher, said: 'Our staff has been preparing for more than a year.' 'We have been working with the airlines, TSA, car rental companies, law enforcement, the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee, the NFL, our restaurant operators and other organizations to develop special operational and staffing plans to give our visitors a world class airport experience.","80,000 passengers expected to depart from Sky Harbor  Airport on Monday .

"Would you choose to cruise on a ship that is owned by Germans, crewed by Germans and almost exclusively filled with Germans? Not sure? I had my doubts, too. Would the food be super-sausaged, schnitzeled and sauerkrauted, the entertainment a mix of oompah bands and the slapping of bottoms in lederhosen? Would I be ‘Herr Villy No Mates’, afloat in a sea of Teutonic banter? Would anyone speak English? Not a sauerkraut sort of place: Europa 2 has been ranked as the world's best cruise ship . Maybe it was time to shake off all those deeply embedded prejudices and step on board Europa 2. One good reason for choosing to cruise on Europa 2 is that she is now rated the world’s best by the authoritative Berlitz Guide To Cruising, with five-plus stars. Guess who Europa 2 knocked off the No 1 perch when she arrived in 2012? Her older sister, Europa 1. That’s sibling rivalry for you. Europa 2 is a space ship. She has the highest ratio of space per passenger than any ship afloat, with wide corridors, high ceilings and floods of natural light. Designed to appeal to a younger market, her look is gently contemporary. There is even a Damien Hirst and a Hockney among her 1,000 original works of art. Other high-spec components include a 15-metre heated pool with a fully retractable roof, an excellent spa, a cookery school, seven different restaurants, a jazz club, a plush theatre and a cigar bar with 37 different varieties of gin. All very elegant: The ship's atrium comes with its own grand piano and a definite air of refinement . Like everyone else in the mainly German crew, Alex the barman could not only speak English but could even do a convincing range of accents, Brummie to Scouse. Luxury is all pervading. Each of the 250 suites comes with a verandah and a bed that can be hardened or softened at the touch of a button. I soaked in a proper, full-size tub while watching a TV screen embedded in the bathroom mirror. To my right, I could see global atrocities on BBC World News, then, turning the other cheek, I tuned into a view of the ocean, framed by the arid landscapes of the Moroccan coast. More than a simple ship: Step on board, and you feel that you are checking in to a luxury hotel . I had joined the ship in Lisbon and sailed due south to Casablanca, home to the immense mosque of Hassan II, a hassle-free souk with the usual spread of pouffes, banana slippers, mint tea sets and fashionable candle lamps, and Rick’s Cafe, owned and hostessed by ex-U.S. diplomat Kathy Kirker - and modelled on the one created in Hollywood for the Bogart/Bergman movie. At Agadir, I went to the beach. An odd thing about cruising is that while the focus is all about the sea, you rarely get a chance to dip you toes in it. Luxury on Europa 2, curiously, is as much about what it doesn’t have as well as what’s there. You won’t find a casino, entertainment overload, set times or places for dining or formal nights. I didn’t see a tie all week, let alone a black one. And another thing missing was noise, with none of the usual barrage of announcements telling you what the weather is like and where the napkin-folding lessons are taking place. It was also easy being a Briton on board. Inga, a waitress from Wuppertal, told me that in the crew’s quarters there is a huge photo collage of every passenger, which helps them put names to faces before we try to order our first breakfast of haferflocken (porridge) or hoppel poppel (scrambled egg with bacon and sausage). Night time attractions: The ship has a host of restaurants and bars where you can while away the evening . Of course, the most luxurious ship in the world doesn’t come cheap. Reckon on £500 a day, including gratuities, but excluding shore excursions, drinks and flights. But perhaps the biggest surprise was finding that Europa 2’s owner, Hapag-Lloyd, is now part of the vast TUI family, making her a cousin, once removed, of Thomson, First Choice and the rest of that familiar clan. The Cruise People (020 7723 2450, www.cruisepeople.co.uk) offers a seven-night cruise aboard Europa 2 from £3,570 per person, departing Kusadasi, Turkey on October 10, 2015, and sailing to Piraeus, Athens. Ports of call include Bodrum, Rhodes, Santorini and Mykonos. Price includes full board, mini-bar in the suite, entertainment, port fees and basic gratuities.

"President Barack Obama is . urging parents to get their children vaccinated in the face of a . measles outbreak that has infected more than 100 people in the . United States. But New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who may run for Obama's job next year, insisted on Monday that moms and dads deserve 'some measure of choice' in the matter. His press aides scrambled in the late morning hours to contain the political damage, trying to clarify and re-frame what he said while touring a biomedical company in Cambridge, England. In an interview taped Sunday before the Super Bown but aired on Monday's 'Today' show, Obama said measles was a preventable disease. 'I understand that there are families that in some cases are concerned about the effect of vaccinations,' he explained. 'The science is, you know, pretty indisputable. We've looked at this again and again. There is every reason to get vaccinated, but there aren't reasons to not.' 'You should get your kids vaccinated,' Obama added. 'SCIENCE IS ... PRETTY INDISPUTABLE': Obama said in an interview aired Monday that parents should vaccinate their children . New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (right) and his wife Mary Pat (center) visited a life science company in Cambridge, England on Monday, where he waded into the global controversy over childhood vaccines . A MOMENT OF PAIN, A LIFETIME OF SECURITY: Vaccines protect against measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Pertussis, and a host of other diseases that used to kill countless children . Christie, a likely Republican candidate for president, said Monday that parents should have some choice on whether to vaccinate their children. Christie's comments came after touring the facilities of MedImmune, the manufacturer of the flu vaccine FluMist, during a three-day trade mission to the United Kingdom. He said he and his wife had vaccinated their children, describing that decision as 'the best expression I can give you of my opinion.' Doing so is an 'important part of making sure we protect their health and the public health,' Christe added. 'But it’s much more important, I think, what you think as a parent than what you think as a public official.' 'I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well. So that's the balance that the government has to decide.' 'It depends on what the vaccine is, what the disease type is and all the rest,' he said. 'And so I didn't say I'm leaving people the option. What I'm saying is that you have to have that balance in considering parental concerns.' 'Not every vaccine is created equal and not every disease type is as great a public health threat as others. So that's what I mean by that so that I’m not misunderstood.' Sensing a backlash, Christie's press office sent a statement to reporters on Monday morning insisting that he 'believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated.' 'At the same time different states require different degrees of vaccination, which is why he was calling for balance in which ones government should mandate,' the statement said. All states currently require children to get certain vaccinations to enroll in school, although California and New Jersey are among 20 states that let parents opt out by obtaining personal belief waivers. Parents in New Jersey seeking a medical exemption have to submit a written statement from their doctor or registered nurse indicating why the exemption is needed.

Chris Christie, right, wearing an Arsenal scarf, sat on Sunday with Rutgers University President Robert Barchi in the stands during the English Premier League soccer match between Arsenal and Aston Villa at the Emirates stadium in London . HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH? Disneyland in Anaheim, California si the epicenter of a measles outbreak which, so far, hasn't killed anyone . The MMR vaccine likely saves tens of thousands of lives each year . There have been 91 measles cases in California, with at . least 58 of those epidemiologically linked to a cluster that . began at Disneyland in December. More than a dozen other cases . have been confirmed in 13 other U.S. states and in Mexico. No deaths have been reported in connection with the . outbreak, which public health officials suspect began when an . infected person from outside the United States visited . Disneyland in Anaheim, California, between Dec. 15 and Dec. 20. The measles outbreak has renewed a debate over the so-called . anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side . effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked research suggesting . a link to autism, have led a small minority of parents to refuse . to allow their children to be inoculated. Some parents also opt not to have their children vaccinated . for religious or other reasons. Hollywood stars including Jenny McCarthy and Kristen Cavallari have urged parents to rethink vaccines, pointing to what they say is an increase in diagnosed cases of autism. McCarthy now insists she's not stritcly against vaccinations – but objects to the compressed schedule along with governments recommend they be applied. Obama said the larger the group of unvaccinated people, the . more vulnerable it made small infants and people who cannot get . vaccinations because of health issues. HEALTH NUT: Satellite radio host and former Playboy centerfold model Jenny McCarthy insists she's not opposed to all childhood vaccines, but her reputation as the queen of the 'anti-vax' movement is solid . Kristin Cavallari (right) believes 'there are very scary statistics out there regarding what is in vaccines and what they cause'; theories about a rise in autism diagnoses connected to childhood vaccinations have been widely debunked . In thousands of cases each year, vaccinated children who are later treated with radiation for leukemia and other cancers find themselves lacking antibodies that fight off communicable diseases. Those children can be at increased health risk if they are around others who haven't been vaccinated. The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, commonly called the MMR, is 97 percent effective at preventing measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. New Jersey requires MMR vaccines for children between 12 and 15 months, and then a second at between 4 and 6 years. The American Academy of Pediatrics says doctors should bring up the importance of vaccinations during visits, but should respect a parent's wishes unless there's a significant risk to the child. 'In general, pediatricians should avoid discharging patients from their practices solely because a parent refuses to immunize his or her child,' according to guidelines issued by the group. Measles is a highly contagious disease that spreads through the air, with symptoms that include fever, runny nose and a blotchy rash. The current outbreak originated at Disney theme parks last month, and Mexico and at least six other U.S. states have recorded measles cases connected to Disneyland.","So-called 'anti-vaccination' movement has raised the issue over and over, with Hollywood figures like Jenny McCarthy and Kristin Cavallari drawing fire for their views .

"An image taken by astronauts aboard the International Space Station has revealed remnants of war from space. In the remarkable image, land fortifications and systems of gun emplacements from the Iraq-Iran war can clearly be seen. The photograph reveals fortifications along a 12-mile (20km) stretch of the Iraq-Iran border, near the coast of the Persian Gulf. Scroll down for video . An image taken aboard the International Space Station has revealed remnants of war at the Iran-Iraq border, shown. In the image Iran is at the top right, the border between the countries is the line below the blue dots and Iraq is to the south . The snapshot, captured by an astronaut during Expedition 41 on 7 November 2014, was first thought to show a series of oil-pad installations. But on closer inspection, the ISS team realised that the strange formations aligned along the international boundary were in fact military fortifications. The lofty vantage point of the ISS has given it access to many scenes of conflict since its permanent habitation began in 2000. For instance, astronauts watched on in horror when they saw the terror attacks in New York on Sept 11, 2001. Poignant footage from space showed smoke rising from New York's Twin Towers, moments after two planes smashed into them in the terror attack which killed thousands of people. And in 2008, cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko used an 800mm telephoto lens to take images of the South Ossetia region shortly after Russian forces invaded Georgia. Systems of large curved earthworks, circular gun emplacements, and straight connecting roads run parallel to the international border. This region of oil refining and exporting was the centre of numerous military actions during the war in the 1980s, especially during the defence of the southern city of Basra. Images and views like this are not altogether rare for astronauts aboard the ISS. In July 2014, for example, the world watched on in horror as the conflict between Israel and Gaza escalated - and its devastating impact reached space. Looking down from his perch on the International Space Station 260 miles (415km) above Earth, astronaut Alexander Gerst was able to see rockets lighting up the troubled area. Gerst tweeted an image of the horrifying scenes describing it as his ‘saddest photo yet’. The image shows Tel-Aviv near the centre with the city lights of Be'er Shiva seen towards the centre left. The Gaza Strip runs along the coast to the far left of the photo. Disturbingly, many of the explosions are seen in the densely populated regions. On 10 November, three days after the Iraq-Iran image was taken, three of the six members on the ISS - Russian Maxim Suraev, American Reid Wiseman and German Alexander Gerst - returned to Earth. During their time aboard the station, the crew participated in research focusing on Earth remote sensing, advanced manufacturing, and studies of bone and muscle physiology. They set a milestone for station science by completing a record 82 hours of research in a single week in July. A key research focus during their mission, Expedition 41, was human health management for long duration space travel, as Nasa and Roscosmos prepare for two crew members to spend one year aboard the space station in March 2015. The crew welcomed five cargo spacecraft during its time aboard the orbiting laboratory. Two Russian ISS Progress cargo vehicles docked to the station, bringing tons of supplies in July and October. The fifth and final European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), dubbed the Georges Lemaitre after the Belgian physicist who is considered the father of the Big Bang theory, launched to the station in July. The patterns were spotted near Basra at the border between Iraq and Iran (shown), a remnant of the war in the 1980s .

Three days later three of the six members on the ISS - Russian Maxim Suraev, American Reid Wiseman and German Alexander Gerst - returned to Earth . An Iraqi soldier with an assault rifle at the Khorramshahr Front in Iran in September 1980. War broke out between Iran and Iraq in 1980 and lasted until 1988 following disputes over border disagreements . Wiseman and Gerst ventured outside the confines of the space station for a planned spacewalk to relocate a failed pump module and configure the station for upcoming additions. Wiseman completed a second spacewalk with fellow Nasa astronaut Barry Wilmore. Suraev also conducted one spacewalk during Expedition 41. In addition to being a scientific research platform, the space station also serves as a test bed to demonstrate new technology. The first 3-D printer to be tested in space arrived at the station during Expedition 41. It will be the first step toward establishing an on-demand machine shop in space, which is a critical enabling component for deep space crewed missions and in-space manufacturing. A new Earth monitoring instrument called RapidScat also was installed and activated on the station during the crew’s time in orbit. RapidScat will measure Earth's ocean surface wind speed and direction, essential measurements used in weather prediction. Many other conflicts have been seen by astronauts from space. Here, looking down from his perch 260 miles (415km) above Earth, astronaut Alexander Gerst was able to see rockets lighting up the area as the conflict between Israel and Gaza escalated in July 2014 .

"For years, scientists have predicted that as global warming heats the Earth, the number of storms will increase. But, new research suggests that instead of increasing in number, these storms will increase in intensity - meaning the same number of storms will occur, but they'll be stronger. The  physicists said that this is because global warming will directly affect how the atmosphere circulates air mass, heat and water using what's been dubbed 'Earth's heat engine.' Scroll down for video . Experts from the University of Toronto predict that as the Earth becomes warmer, as a result of climate change, the number of storms will remain the same, but the intensity will increase. This is because global warming will directly affect how heat, air mass and water circulates through the atmosphere . Researchers from the University of Toronto explained that the Earth’s atmosphere needs fuel to work, which in this instance is energy from the sun. As air is warmed by the sun and moves closer to the Equator, the air mass near the surface ‘absorbs’ water through evaporation. The warmer the air mass, the more water it takes up, and as it reaches the Equator, it begins to rise through the atmosphere, eventually cooling as it radiates heat out into space. Cool air typically holds less moisture than warm air, so as the air cools, condensation occurs, and heat is released. When enough heat is released, air begins to rise even further, pulling more air behind it, which ultimately causes a thunderstorm.

When enough heat is released, air begins to rise even further, pulling more air behind it, which ultimately causes a thunderstorm. The ‘output’ of this atmospheric engine, and storms, is the amount of heat and moisture that is redistributed between the Equator and the North and South Poles. The ‘output’ of this atmospheric engine, and storms, is the amount of heat and moisture that is redistributed between the Equator and the North and South Poles. Frederic Laliberté and his colleagues from the University of Toronto wanted to study how climate change will impact how this engine works. They began by comparing climate records from 1981 to 2012 with climate simulations. These simulations model how Earth and its atmosphere will change, and cover the period 1982 to 2098. This comparison revealed that a third of the atmospheric energy is typically involved with the movement of water through the cycle. But, as a result of climate change, the atmosphere is expected to use more energy during this part of the cycle. This is because the air will be warmer, so will take up more water, which will create more evaporation and precipitation. By using more energy to move the water, less energy is used to circulate the air mass, and an increase in water vapour, put simply, will make the process less efficient. The atmosphere still needs to get rid of the precipitation it collects, but because circulation is affected, it has to do this in fewer, more intense storms. Air masses that are able to reach the top of the atmosphere are strengthened, while those that can’t, are weakened. Thunderstorms get  energy from the heat released by the condensation of water vapour (illustrated). Using climate records, and simulations up to 2098, experts said warming will create more precipitation and less circulation. The number of storms will stay the same, but they will become more intense to get rid of the water . ‘We know that with global warming we'll get more evaporation of the oceans,’ said Mr Laliberte. ‘But circulation in the atmosphere is like a heat engine that requires fuel to do work, just like any combustion engine or a convection engine.’ ‘By viewing the atmospheric circulation as a heat engine, we were able to rely on the laws of thermodynamics to analyse how the circulation would change in a simulation of global warming. ‘We used these laws to quantify how the increase in water vapour that would result from global warming would influence the strength of the atmospheric circulation.’ Put simply, Mr Laliberte added ‘powerful storms are strengthened at the expense of weaker storms’, so over the years, atmospheric circulation will adapt to this less efficient form of heat transfer and will cause 'fewer storms.'","Earth’s atmosphere uses solar energy to run a so-called ‘heat engine’

"Cell phone records for the mom accused of poisoning her son with salt reveal she used her smart device to search for information on ways to commit suicide in the days following the boy's death. Lacey Spears, 27, whose trail begins in Westchester, New York, on Monday is charged with depraved murder and manslaughter in the death of her five-year-old son Garnett-Paul Spears a year ago. Spears' cellphone activity in the days leading up and immediately after January 23, 2014 - when Garnett Spears was declared brain dead - will be included as evidence in her trail. Lacey Spears, 27, whose trail begins in Westchester, New York, on Monday is charged with murdering her five-year-old son Garnett-Paul Spears a year ago . As she faced charges of murder and manslaughter over her son's death, Spears' used her phone to research people who've killed themselves by overdosing on sleeping pills and self-injecting insulin. Records show Spears searched 'overdose on sleeping pills' on Google and also searched for stories about suicide and queried whether overdosing on pills would be effective. A day earlier, she had conducted numerous online searches on insulin, including 'insulin poisoning with suicidal intent,' and the story of 'Kenneth Barlow: the first documented case of murder by insulin.' In the lead up to her son's death, Spears had been highly active on social media as she chronicled Garnett's health issues and posted photos of his declining health. In rulings delivered last week, Spears' messages on Facebook, Twitter and MySpace were determined relevant and are likely to be introduced as evidence. The boy's sodium levels rose to a dangerous point with no medical explanation, prosecutors said, leading to a swollen brain, seizures and death. Mother: Lacey Spears is accused of killing her 5-year-old son Garnett-Paul Spears (seen right) by poisoning him with salt and documenting his decline on social media . They believe his single mother, who was sharing his hospital room at Westchester Medical Center, administered salt through a feeding tube into Garnett's stomach. All the while, she was keeping followers up to date with 28 online postings in the last 11 days of his life, noting his death with, 'Garnett the great journeyed onward today at 10:20 a.m.' She had tens of thousands of entries over Garnett's lifetime, many about his doctor and hospital visits. 'My Sweet Angel Is In The Hospital For The 23rd Time,' Spears tweeted on Nov. 9, 2009, adding a sad-faced emoticon. 'Please Pray He Gets To Come Home Soon. The records show Spears also researched 'dangers of high sodium' and hypernatremia (high levels of sodium in the blood) several days before Garnett was admitted to hospital with seizures on January 17. Spears also searched for iodized salt the morning of January 19, after learning that Garnett was to be released from hospital because he was no longer having seizures. Garnett's sodium levels rose to a dangerous point with no medical explanation, prosecutors said, leading to a swollen brain, seizures and death. They believe his mother,  administered salt through a feeding tube into Garnett's stomach . She then repeatedly took him to the bathroom and he returned visibly ill each time, the papers say. His sodium level spiked to such a degree that he was airlifted to Westchester Medical Center, where he later died. Jury selection began last Monday with a pool of 90 potential jurors on hand at the courthouse. Several told the judge they had seen some of the extensive news coverage of the case. Spears' trial is to begin at 9:30 a.m. Monday. Prosecutors said that after opening statements, they will have several witnesses ready to testify, including Spears' family friend Oona Younger. Younger, who had visited Spears' home, had seen the boy attached to a feeding tube bag before accompanying the two to Nyack Hospital in the days leading up to Garnett's death, prosecutors said in court records. That bag was later seized by police and tested positive for high levels of sodium. The trial before Westchester County Judge Robert Neary is expected to last three weeks.

She greeted well-wishers and accepted numerous bunches of flowers from fellow church-goers . Church-goers gave Her Majesty several bunches of flowers including purple tulips . Her Majesty and Prince Philip walked together through the churchyard into the church for the service . Prince Philip looked dapper in a colourful tie although he sported a scab on his right ear . The Queen seemed in lively spirits, opting to walk and talk to her subjects outside the church of St Peter and St Paul in West Newton, in the heart of the Sandringham estate. Fellow church-goers offered her bouquets of flowers, which a helpful royal aide held in her arms to give the monarch a free hand. Despite the chilly Norfolk weather, the Queen provided a splash of colour and she accessorised her elegant tailored coat with pearl earrings and an amethyst and pearl flower brooch. Braving a sleet flurry, the Queen took a stroll around the church grounds. While usually the Queen and Prince Philip attend Sunday service at the nearby St Mary Magdalene Church, on February 1, the royals instead visited St Peter and St Paul in West Newton, Sandringham.

"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's attorneys are fighting to move his trial from Boston, saying a photo of a bartender shoveling snow from the finishing line last week shows there is still an 'unprecedented level of public feeling' about the event. Lawyers for the bombing suspect filed a motion on Monday after federal prosecutors opposed earlier requests to move the trial from the city. In the motion they included a photo of local bartender Chris Laudani shoveling snow from the finishing line, which was widely shared on social media as people sought to uncover his identity. 'All major Boston media outlets reported on a photograph depicting a 'mystery shoveler' who cleared the Marathon finish line of snow during this week's blizzard,' defense lawyers wrote. 'Boston's bias': Attorneys for Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have argued that this photo of a bartender shoveling snow from the marathon finishing line last week shows he will not get a fair trial . 'Such stories, and the widespread reaction to them, underscore the impossible task of unmasking juror bias in the very community where 'everyone owns the Marathon',' they wrote, the Boston Herald reported. They argue that Tsarnaev, who is accused of setting off two bombs at the finishing line on April 15, 2013, killing three people and injuring more than 260, will not be able to get a fair trial in Boston. A judge has previously rejected two requests to have the trial moved. Another previous motion filed days after the attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris claimed that the violence had stirred 'extraordinary prejudice' relating to the trial and called for it to be delayed - but the request was rejected. Lawyers are in the process of selecting jurors for the trial but on Monday, jury selection was suspended because of a snowstorm battering the area. Proud: The mystery shoveler - later identified as Chris Laudani - said that he did not think the finish line deserved to be under snow. Attorneys argue that the emotion felt by residents will bias the jury . It is the third time bad weather has stalled the already lengthy process in the past week. They need a pool of nearly 70 qualified jurors before selecting the final 12 jurors and six alternates who will serve in the case. So far, U.S. District Court Judge George O'Toole and the attorneys had questioned 114 jurors individually, according to Masslive.com. Laudani, who has run the marathon five times, was unmasked as the snow shoveling hero after a local resident snapped him at work and shared the image online. He explained that he was shoveling snow outside his workplace a few doors away when the idea came to him to head to the finish line. 'The finish line is my favorite spot in the whole city so I wanted to go down there and dig it out because I don't think it deserves to be covered in snow,' he told the Today show on Thursday. Trial: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, left, is accused of detonating two bombs at the finish line in April 2013 with his brother Tamerlan, right, who died in a police shootout in the days after the tragedy . In court: Tsarnaev, left, is seen in a court sketch from January 5 beside U.S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr., right, as O'Toole addresses a pool of potential jurors. Jury selection for the case is still underway . 'Obviously it holds a special place in everybody in Boston's heart but for me it was more about the spirit of the Boston Marathon and the incredible amount of encouragement and positivity that surrounds the event and how much people, including myself, just love the race.' Tsarnaev, 21, has pleaded not guilty to the bombings that he allegedly carried out with his older brother Tamerlan, who was killed during a police manhunt. It is believed that when Tsarnaev's case begins, his lawyers are likely to pin the bombings on Tamerlan, his 'role model'. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was 19 at the time. If convicted, he could face the death penalty.","An image of a mystery man - later identified as bartender Chris Laudani - shoveling snow from the  finishing line was shared online last week .

"Between 16 and 18 June 1889, Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh created one his most famous works from the view out of an asylum window: The Starry Night. Debate on the masterpiece's distinctive ‘swirls’ has raged ever since, with many saying they were extensions of his fragile state at the time. But now an artist has claimed that the spirals actually depict galaxies in the universe, and were likely inspired by drawings of the cosmos at the time. US artist Michael Benson says the Whirlpool Galaxy inspired van Gogh. The Dutch painter created arguably his most famous work - The Starry Night (shown) - in 1889 from the view out of his asylum window . The claim was made by American artist and photographer Michael Benson in his new book, Cosmigraphics, reported PRI. Of particular interest, he says, is a drawing of the Whirlpool Galaxy - official designation M51a - by Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, in the mid 19th century. To observe the night sky, Lord Rosse built the largest telescope at the time - one with a mirror six feet (1.8 metres) in diameter - with which he observed the galaxy and made his drawing. Vincent van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist famous for his psychedelic landscapes and self-portraits. He painted The Starry Night in 1889, inspired by the view outside of his asylum in Southern France, where he was being treated for a string of nervous breakdowns. One of his most famous works, The Starry Night now hangs in New York's Museum of Modern Art. ‘We believe that drawing led directly to Starry Night, the most famous artistic depiction of the night sky,’ said Mr Benson. ‘Either it was in the library of the asylum in the south of France, or he saw it in Paris.’ At the time, van Gogh was in an asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in Southern France - and the painting is a depiction of his view out of the window. The technique of using swirls later appeared in many more of van Gogh’s work - although whether they were inspired by the Whirlpool Galaxy drawing or not may never be known for sure. The Whirlpool Galaxy is about 23 million light-years away and is roughly the size of the Milky Way at about 60,000 light-years in diameter. Interestingly, it was the first galaxy found to have a spiral structure - although at the time astronomers thought other galaxies were nebulae, not galaxies. It was not until 1922 that American astronomer Edwin Hubble first proved that our galaxy was just one of many, many more in the universe. In 1850, an astronomer depicted what a distant spiral galaxy might look like for the first time. Lord Rosse's Whirlpool Galaxy drawing (shown) may have inspired van Gogh, according to Mr Benson. At the time, though, it was thought this was a nebula, and not another galaxy . The Whirlpool Galaxy  is about 23 million light-years away and is roughly the size of the Milky Way at about 60,000 light-years in diameter. This image taken by the Hubble Space Telscope shows the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51A or NGC 5194) on the left, while the smaller object in the upper right is M51B or NGC 5195 . The link between Lord Rosse's drawing and van Gogh's Starry Night is not completely new. In June last year, Dr Omar Nasim, a Newton International Fellow at Oxford University’s Faculty of History, provided his own context and insight into the connection in his book Observing by Hand. 'The Whirlpool Galaxy can clearly be seen at the centre of Van Gogh’s Starry Night, which seems to have been inspired by the artist’s knowledge of Camille Flammarion, a French writer who popularised Rosse’s vision,’ he said. ‘Flammarion described astronomical objects floating, as though “lost in the depths of the sky”, and was moved by the awe and terror they evoked “even in a cold engraving”. 'Van Gogh wrote of a similar sense of wonder shortly before he painted Starry Night. 'He paints the night sky as though newly discovered astronomical phenomena could be seen with the naked eye, expanding human imagination and perception by lending the viewer ""telescopic eyes"".'","US artist Michael Benson says the Whirlpool Galaxy inspired van Gogh .

"It's known as the island where condemned men and women come to die and for Bali Nine ringleaders Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, Nusa Kambangan or 'execution island' is where they will take their final breaths. The tranquil Island off the coast of Java is misleading in pictures. Surrounded by pristine water, luscious green trees and white sand beaches, it appears to be a tourist's dream. However looks can be deceiving and as news emerged yesterday that Sukumaran and Chan will be executed on this  island in the next round of inmates on death row, it will have become their nightmare. Scroll down for video . It was confirmed on Monday that both Chan and Sukumaran will face the firing squad in the next group of inmates to be executed on death row . The men will be housed on Nusa Kambangan for the remainder of their days. There are seven prisons on the island . Nusa Kambangan is deceiving.  It's pristine waters and white sandy beaches are a tourist's dream. However there is a dark side to the island . Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran (above) are scheduled for execution in 2015 . According to Nine News Sukumaran and Chan will be taken in the dead of night from their cells at Kerobokan Prison in Denpasar and flown to Jogjakarta. From there they will take a five-hour journey through the villages of Java before they arrive at the port of Cilicap. The men will then be taken by boat into restricted waters, where they will  get their first glimpse of the notorious correctional centre on Nusa Kambangan. From there the Australian men will be housed in one of the seven prisons on the island , where they will live out the remainder of their days before they are lined up in front of the executioners. Security around the island will be tightened when the inmates are taken into the facility. Previous human rights campaigners have disrupted executions and journalists posing as fishermen have been deported because of their illegal activity. The pair, who have been on death row since 2006, could face death at any stage under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases. Nusa Kambangan is where the Bali bombers faced the firing squad and where six drug criminals were executed two weeks ago. Sukumaran and Chan (above) are on a list of 26 prisoners Indonesia says will be executed this year . It's known as the island where condemned men and women come to die and for Bali Nine ringleaders Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, Nusa Kambangan is where they will take their final breaths . Sukumaran and Chan may only be given several days notice if scheduled for execution, facing the imminent possibility of their death following the recent increase in criminal executions after a five year respite. After living on death row in Kerobokan Prison in Denpasar, Indonesia, for almost a decade, and four failed clemency applications, Sukumaran and Chan are on a list of 26 prisoners Indonesia says will be executed this year. Chan and Sukumaran will be taken from their cells at midnight to face their death with their hands and feet shackled. The pair will be offered blindfolds to wear, and will have white aprons around their neck and a red target on their chest. The tranquil Island off the coast of Java is misleading in pictures. Surrounded by pristine water and white sand beaches, it appears to be a tourist's dream . However looks can be deceiving and as news emerged yesterday that Sukumaran and Chan will be executed on this very island in the next round of inmates on death row, it will have become their nightmare . Each execution takes on the same form. Inmates are asked if they have any final requests, they are then lined up in front of a group of shooters - only three with live ammunition - and shot dead. A common recurrence is that it always happens after midnight. Chan and Sukumaran will also be given choice to stand, sit or lie down when the firing squad carries out their execution from a distance of between five and ten metres, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. Indonesia's attorney-general  confirmed yesterday that Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan are in the next group of death row prisoners to be executed. HM Prasetyo last week said Australians were among the foreign drug offenders in line for executions, but didn't reveal their names. If Chan and Sukumaran are executed under the same conditions that previous inmates have faced, they will be taken from their cells at midnight to face their death with their hands and feet shackled . The members of the Bali Nine were arrested in 2005 on charges of a plot to smuggle heroin into Australia . Asked on Monday if Chan and Sukumaran were on the list for the next round, he told reporters: 'Yes, included in the next round.' The timing was yet to be determined, he said. The pair have been informed that they will face execution together for their plot to smuggle over 8 kilograms of heroin into Australia. Speaking to Nine, Irish priest Father Charlie Brown explained how he had watched two executions in his lifetime. Each lasted for seven to eight minutes and each was 'torturous'. 'The presidents said they’re all going to be executed. That means none of them have any hope anymore and you can't live without hope,' he said. ‘The prisoners after being shot it took them seven or eight minutes to die. They were moaning in pain for that seven or eight minutes and that for me is torture.' In 2008, Nigerian nationals Samuel Iwuchukwu Okoye and Hansen Antonious Nwaolisa were strapped to crucifixes with black hoods over their heads before being shot, reported news.com.au. 'It was simple: one, two, three, then ‘bang’,' said Father Charlie Burrows, who witnessed their deaths. Nestled off the coast of Java, Nusa Kambangan is home to many but it is also the home of Indonesia's most notorious criminals . Speaking to Nine, Irish priest Father Charlie Brown explained how he had watched two executions in his lifetime. Each lasted for seven to eight minutes and each was 'torturous' The pair took nearly ten minutes to be pronounced dead, moaning and bleeding until they succumbed to their injuries. 'I think it is cruel, the torture...The blood came out slowly; they were in pain,' Father  Burrows said during his testimony before Indonesia’s Constitutional Court. Both Sukamaran and Chan's mercy pleas were rejected by the Indonesian government despite the fact that they could prove they had rehabilitated themselves during their ten years behind bars. Julian McMahon, the pair's Australian lawyer, said that executions were 'not clean killings', and that prisoners may be tied to a plank before being shot. 'If the prisoner isn't dead straight away, the commanding officer is meant to walk up and then put a bullet in the head,' Mr McMahon said. Mr McMahon said that Sukamaran and Chan were traumatised by their impending execution, and often dreamed of being shot in the heart by the prison's firing squad. Inmates are taken to the correctional centre via a boat. The water is restricted so only prison officials are allowed to get up close to it . It is highly protected. Security is stepped up just before executions as human rights campaigners have been known to storm the island and interupt the shootings . Sukamaran's mercy plea was rejected by the Indonesian government on December 30th . Sukamaran and Chan attended school together at Homebush Boys High School in Sydney's west, and Chan said the pair had been relying on each other in an attempt to 'trying to stay strong for our family and friends at this difficult time.' 'It is hard to think that our lives are in the hands of two men - Tony Abbott and Joko Widodo - who have the power to grant life and death - please pray for a change of heart for these men and for our families,' he wrote in comments passed onto the Facebook page Friends of Andrew Chan. Mr McMahon labelled the executions 'chilling', and said that he could not fathom simply taking prisoners outside and shooting them. 'It seemed impossible to be true that they would take out these people on the weekend and just shoot them. That was my first reaction,' Mr McMahon said. Mr McMahon labelled the 'injustice' of the situation 'heartbreaking' and said that the pair had made significant efforts to improve their lives and the lives of others in the Indonesian prison system . Mr Abbott (with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, left) said earlier this month that his government would make 'the strongest possible representations' to Indonesia to seek a stay of execution . Mercy Campaign co-founder Brigid Delaney called on Prime Minister Tony Abbott to increase his efforts to save the men's lives, calling his response 'very weak'. Mr Abbott said  that his government would make 'the strongest possible representations' to Indonesia to seek a stay of execution, but admitted he would not risk jeopardising diplomatic relations. 'If this does go ahead I think there will be such visceral outrage and questions will be asked of Tony Abbott - why didn't you do more?,' Ms Delaney said. A spokesperson for Denpasar District Court displays a Clemency Decree for Sukumaran . Lawyer Julian McMahon labelled the executions 'chilling', and said that he could not fathom simply taking prisoners outside and shooting them . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop made a direct appeal to Indonesia's Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, reported The Australian. 'They [the Australian Government] tried their utmost, they asked us to reconsider our decisions because their citizens have shown remorse, have expressed their deepest regrets,' said a spokesperson for Indonesia's Foreign Ministry. Mr McMahon labelled the 'injustice' of the situation 'heartbreaking' and said that the pair had made significant efforts to improve their lives and the lives of others in the Indonesian prison system. 'Myuran and Andrew are not just reformed prisoners leading good lives. They have indisputably changed and improved the lives of many prisoners,' he said.

"Two sculptures that languished in obscurity for more than a century are to be unveiled today as the only surviving bronzes by Michelangelo . Two sculptures that languished in obscurity for more than a century are to be unveiled today as the only surviving bronzes by Michelangelo. A team of international experts has used X-rays and a 500-year-old sketch to build a portfolio of evidence to back the case that they are the works of the Renaissance master. The pair of sculptures – showing naked, muscular men riding triumphantly on two ferocious panthers – were made shortly after Michelangelo completed the marble David and as he was about to begin painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Victoria Avery, keeper of the applied arts department of the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, where the pair will go on public display tomorrow, said the sculptures had been attributed to Michelangelo following 'a Renaissance whodunnit' investigation. 'It has been fantastically exciting to have been able to participate in this ground-breaking project, which has involved input from many art historians in the UK, Europe and the States, and to draw on evidence from conservation scientists and anatomists,' she said. 'The bronzes are exceptionally powerful and compelling works of art that deserve close-up study. We hope the public will come and examine them for themselves and engage with this ongoing debate. It has been a huge privilege to be involved, very exciting and great fun.' Known as the Rothschild Bronzes, the pieces are a metre tall and owned by a British private collector. One figure is older and lithe, the other young and athletic. Dr Avery added: 'Whoever made them clearly had a profound interest in the male body ... the anatomy is perfect.' The pair of sculptures show naked, muscular men riding triumphantly on two ferocious panthers . The sculptures  were made shortly after Michelangelo completed the marble David, pictured in the Accademia Gallery, Florence . The works were attributed to Michelangelo when they appeared in the collection of Adolphe de Rothschild in the 19th century. But since they were undocumented and unsigned, this claim was dismissed and over the past 120 years the bronzes have been attributed to other sculptors. But a neutron scan at a research institute in Switzerland placed the sculptures in the first decade of the 16th century. And studies by Professor Peter Abrahams, a clinical anatomist at the University of Warwick, found the works bore all the hallmarks of Michelangelo. Last autumn Paul Joannides, emeritus professor of art history at the University of Cambridge, connected the work to a drawing by one of Michelangelo's apprentices now in the Fabre museum of Montpellier. In one corner is a composition of a muscular youth riding a panther, which is very similar in pose to the bronzes. The bronzes were compared with other works by Michelangelo and found to be very similar in style and anatomy to his works of 1500-1510; a date confirmed by the preliminary conclusions of initial scientific analysis, including X-rays. Research is continuing and the final conclusion will be presented in July. The bronzes will be on display until August 9. The four original surviving copies of the Magna Carta have been brought together, pictured is 1215 painting 'King John And The Magna Carta' The four original surviving copies of the Magna Carta have been brought together under the same roof for the first time. The document - one of the first steps in the journey towards parliamentary democracy - will go on show at The British Library in central London as part of its 800th anniversary. More than 40,000 people entered a public ballot for the chance to see them with 1,215 winning the opportunity to visit the display. The documents will be at the library for three days before they are taken to the House of Lords for another day, before two are returned to the library and the others go back to their homes at Lincoln and Salisbury Cathedrals. In a joint statement, the library and the cathedrals said: 'King John could surely never have anticipated the enduring global legacy of Magna Carta when he agreed to its terms in 1215. 'Eight hundred years later, the international interest and excitement about this unification event is testament to the extraordinary significance and symbolic power of these four manuscripts. 'We are thrilled to be staging this moment in history together, as partners, at the start of the 800th anniversary year. For each of our institutions, this unique event marks the beginning of our own celebrations in 2015. 'The British Library, Lincoln Cathedral and Salisbury Cathedral will all be staging exhibitions and events later this year to mark the 800th anniversary of the sealing of this iconic document.'","Two sculptures unveiled  as the only surviving bronzes by Michelangelo .

"A law student left paralysed by a rare spinal condition has defied doctors' predictions and landed a dream career as a model. Katie Knowles, 24, feared she'd never walk again after developing disc degenerative disease and spinal stenosis – a condition that usually only affects pensioners - at just 15 years old. She lost feeling in her toes, feet, and thighs and couldn't even get out of bed without help – a devastating situation for a girl who had previously been a ballet dancer, swimmer, badminton player and horse rider. Katie Knowles, 24, has defied medics to become a model (left) despite being struck down with a rare spinal condition that left her paralysed and meant she had learn to walk all over again (right) Ms Knowles was approached by agency Models of Diversity, and is now campaigning for more representation of disabled people in the modelling industry and the media . After years of back pain, Miss Knowles was diagnosed with spinal stenosis due to a slipped disc in her back at just 15 years old. At 20 years old she underwent a nine hour operation  to remove the slipped disc in her back. But when she woke up she had lost all mobility in the lower half of her body . Despite doctors warning her paralysis meant she faced life in a wheelchair, she underwent physiotherapy and fought hard to learn to walk all over again. And though at one point she 'thought her life was over', she has now launched a career as a model, and wants to inspire other people with mobility issues to follow their dreams. Miss Knowles, from Newcastle, said: 'When I realised I couldn't walk I felt like my life was over - I couldn't feel my feet and parts of my legs, it was horrendous - it was like I was paralysed. 'I was so used to being active, I danced regularly, played Badminton for the county, and swam competitively, but suddenly I couldn't do anything at all. 'Learning to walk again was so difficult and frustrating - I got the nickname Bambi at physio because I was so wobbly. 'I was very determined, and taking my first steps was just amazing, but the experience left me with no confidence at all. 'A friend suggested that I should try some modelling, as she had already done it, so I agreed to take some pictures with her for fun. Spinal stenosis is the narrowing of the spinal canal. It can be caused by problems, including overgrowth of bone or other tissue or by a herniated disc. Sometimes called a slipped disc or a ruptured disc, a herniated disc occurs when some of the softer 'jelly' pushes out through a crack in the tougher exterior. When the spinal canal which surrounds the spinal cord gets too narrow, it can squeeze and choke the spinal cord or nearby nerve roots. Spinal stenosis can cause pain, numbness, or weakness in the legs, buttocks, arms, or neck, depending on which area of the spine is affected. This is known medically as 'sciatica'. 'Before I knew it she'd put them online, and I had photographers and brands contacting me to work with them - it was unbelievable.' Despite her condition, Miss Knowles is determined to carve out a successful career for herself. She said: 'I still use my crutches all the time, and on a really bad day I'll use a wheelchair, but I won't let that stop me. 'I'll try anything at shoots because I want to prove to the photographer that I'm a good model. 'I once modelled on a horse, and it threw me off backwards - everyone else was concerned about my back but I was more worried about my hair and make up. 'I did a bridal shoot once, and one of the photographer's helpers had to hide under my dress holding me steady because I was quite unstable on my feet. 'But if there's a pose or a shot that the photographer wants, I'll do everything to make sure I can achieve it.' After years of living with pain, Miss Knowles was diagnosed with disc degenerative disease, where one of the discs in the spinal cord becomes worn away (sometimes referred to as a 'slipped disc'), causing pain in the back. She was also diagnosed with spinal stenosis – in which the spinal canal become narrowed, squeezing and choking the spinal cord or nearby nerve roots - causing pain, tingling and weakness in the back and legs (known as sciatica), at just 15 years old. The disease stunned doctors, who had never seen a case in someone so young before. Miss Knowles said: 'When doctors first suspected I had the condition, they couldn't quite believe it because it's something that only happens to old people. 'They wondered if I'd some kind of trauma, but no one can work out why I have it - it's just one of those things. Though doctors said she faced a life in a wheelchair, Miss Knowles was determined to walk again. As her confidence had been shattered by the ordeal, a friend recommended she tried modelling. She discovered she loved being behind the camera and was approached by other photographers . Doctors were stunned when Miss Knowles was diagnosed with spinal stenosis at just 15 years old, as this condition is normally only seen in pensioners. She lost confidence after being left paralysed, but modelling gave her a new sense of purpose. She is pictured (left and right) posing in her own photographs . Before her diagnosis, Miss Knowles was a keen sportswoman. She is pictured on a family skiing holiday . 'It's funny because now my Nana, who is 82, has been diagnosed with the same thing.' At 16 years old she underwent surgery to remove the part of the slipped disc that was pressing on her nerve, in the hope that it would reduce her back pain. However, four years later the pain returned and so doctors decided to carry out a more extreme operation to remove the  disc entirely. It was after this operation Miss Knowles woke up unable to feel  or move anything in her lower body. Ms Knowles said: 'They took a bone graft from my hip and put it where the disc was, then they put rods either side of the new disc and screwed it all in place. 'It took nine hours and was supposed to be the cure I needed, but I woke up in agony and completely unable to walk.' The once active student woke up to a completely new life - and was horrified to discover that she had lost her mobility. After six months of physiotherapy, and feeling as though her life had been shattered by her paralysis, Miss Knowles is proud to have learned to walk again.After six months of physiotherapy, and feeling as though her life had been shattered by her paralysis, Miss Knowles is proud to have learned to walk again. 'I was so young when I got this condition that there were no other people my age to talk to about it, I thought it was the end of the world,' Miss Knowles said. However, modelling gave her a new sense of purpose . This was a known risk of the surgery - but was unexpected in Miss Knowles' case. Feeling as though her life as she knew it had been shattered, her journey to being able to walk again was difficult. She said: 'I was out of hospital, but I still had a long way to go, plus my confidence was at an all time low. 'I'd put on a lot of weight in hospital, and I just felt like a different person. 'I couldn't dance or do any sports, and I'd lost my independence because I was so unsteady.' But after being introduced to modelling by a friend, she discovered a new sense of purpose. Miss Knowles said: 'My friend, who also has mobility issues, suggested I try modelling, as it had boosted her confidence too. 'I had nothing to lose so I thought I may as well give it a go. 'As soon as I got in front of the camera I loved it, and the response was amazing. Before being diagnosed at 16 years old, Miss Knowles was a keen ballet dancer (left), badminton player (pictured right with a medal) and horse rider. But she was blighted by agonising back pain . Now, Miss Knowles is trying to raise as much awareness of her condition as possible. 'Disabled people receive so little representation in the media, so Models of Diversity is trying to change that. I want to show people that you don't have to let it hold you back - you can still achieve your dreams,' she said . 'I'm now the face of some independent clothing labels, and I regularly pose for photographers.

"Police are investigating whether a fatal car crash, which left three family members dead and a young child fighting for his life, was deliberately caused by the father driving the vehicle. The Milne family were travelling north along Enterprise Drive in Berkeley Vale on the NSW Central Coast on Sunday when their car left the road. The vehicle ploughed into a tree whilst travelling somewhere between 90 and 100 km/h. Sydney residents Darren Milne, 42, his wife Susana, 39, and their eldest son Liam, 11, were all killed in the crash, whilst their 7-year-old son was airlifted to Westmead Children's Hospital in a critical condition.

Darren and Susana Milne were driving with their two sons in a silver Toyota station wagon heading north on Enterprise Drive at Berkeley Vale on the NSW Central Coast on Sunday afternoon when the car veered off the road and hit a tree . Police searched the family's Ryde home and removed documents and a computer . The seven-year-old crash survivor has undergone surgery for extensive head and internal injuries and whilst he is still critical, his condition has stabilised. Police allegedly 'have evidence that the father Darren deliberately drove off the road and into a tree', according to Seven News. An investigation is underway with evidence being collected for the coroner to determine whether the crash was an intentional murder-suicide or a tragic accident. Nine News also allege that strongest line of inquiry is whether Mr Milne intentionally failed to brake. Investigators searched the family's Ryde home and seized a computer and documents. Police allegedly found evidence that Mr Milne had been researching the Berkely Vale road where the accident occurred in the days leading up to their deaths, according to Seven News. Immediately after the accident, Tuggerah Lakes duty officer Inspector Colin Lott said, 'There are many scenarios that could be run by here — it could be inattention, it might be tiredness, so it's far too early to speculate at this stage,' he said. 'It was not a savage turn and the car was only a few metres off the road,' Inspector Lott said. 'Most likely the driver turned to speak to the children.'

"Sales of ukuleles are soaring as the quirky four-stringed instrument enjoys a dramatic resurgence. The instrument, originally from Hawaii, was championed in Britain by the comedian George Formby. His comic music hall songs like When I’m Cleaning Windows and Leaning on a Lamppost became smash hits of the Thirties and Forties. Sales of ukuleles are soaring thanks to new musicians bringing it to the attention of younger audiences . Lately, however, it has enjoyed a resurgence thanks to new musicians – including London folk band Mumford and Sons – bringing it to the attention of younger audiences. Now, The Music Industries Association (MIA) in the UK said combined online and high street sales have doubled in Britain to about 250,000 a year over the past five years. The rise in sales has been helped by the fact it is relatively cheap, with John Lewis selling the instruments for about £25. Paul McManus, chief executive of the MIA, told The Times: ‘We’re seeing a global effect. 'There is the Mumford effect, but also schools are using it as an alternative to recorders as an easy, cost-effective instrument to start learning.’ The instrument, originally from Hawaii, was championed in Britain by the comedian George Formby . London folk band Mumford and Sons has helped raise the profile of the ukulele. Pictured: Marcus Mumford . Hundreds of ukulele clubs have sprung up across Britain over the past few years.

"This is the moment a stunned group of Russian fisherman looked on in horror as their cars disappeared beneath the ice and into the freezing water below. The friends had driven out to Gertner Bay in eastern Russia's Sea of Okhotsk for a spot of ice fishing. They parked up on the frozen water and set up their fishing equipment a little distance off. The group had just drilled their fishing holes and settled down in the subzero temperatures to wait for a nibble when they heard a loud cracking sound. Scroll down for video . That sinking feeling: A group of friends had driven out onto the frozen Gertner Bay in eastern Russia's Sea of Okhotsk when their cars began to disappear beneath the ice . Fisherman Iskander Aksakov, 45, said: 'We all looked at each other and then turned to see what had happened. 'We were all thinking the same thing - that the ice was cracking and we would go in. 'But when we saw it was our Jeeps going in we were completely shocked.' The pictures reveal the men's desperate attempts to save their jeeps before they slipped into the Sea of Okhotsk. 'Someone shouted out 'Noooo' and ran over to try and grab his vehicle but it was too late,' added Iskander. The other men leapt up and ran to try and save their vehicles as the ice melted taking some of the cars under. Stunned Iskander Aksakov, 45, and his friends had left the cars parked up on the ice to go fishing when they heard the ice cracking under their weight and saw them sinking .

Jaroslav Andrejew, 38, said: 'Luckily, I managed to get to my car - a Toyota Surf - before it went down. 'I then tied a rope to the front and the other end to my mate's car and pulled it out. 'But there was no way I could get all of them.' But not everyone was so lucky. Many of the group were not able to get their cars out in time and by the end, a dozen vehicles had been lost beneath the ice. Climate officials in Russia warned that fishing on frozen lakes or sea in the afternoon sun was 'highly dangerous' as the melting ice may not be able to take the weight of a person- let alone that of a vehicle. Weather expert Dmitry Aksyonov said: 'This sort of thing happens every year. 'Those who go out onto frozen lakes at night are generally fine. But for those who are still there in the afternoon, as this group was, it is highly dangerous as the ice is melting. 'Although it might be able to hold a man, it certainly isn't strong enough for a two-tonne vehicle.'

"Former star football player-turned-broadcaster Warren Sapp was arrested in Phoenix for allegedly soliciting two prostitutes early Monday morning, just hours after the Super Bowl. The 42-year-old former defensive tackle and seven-time Pro Bowler was also charged with assault. Sapp, a member of the Football Hall of Fame, was in town covering the big game for NFL Network. Scroll down for video . In custody: Former star football player-turned-TV presenter Warren Sapp was arrested in Phoenix for allegedly soliciting two prostitutes early Monday morning, just hours after the Super Bowl . Storied career: Sapp played 13 seasons in the NFL, first with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and later with the Oakland Raiders . The incident took place early Monday morning at Renaissance Hotel in downtown Phoenix . A spokesperson for the channel said Monday afternoon that Sapp has been suspended indefinitely and without pay pending an investigation. Sapp's biography has since been pulled from NFL Network's On-Air Talent list on its website. The football analyst was booked into the Maricopa County Jail on misdemeanor charges of soliciting prostitution and assault. He has since been released from custody without bail after a judge ruled that he was not a flight risk. According to reporting by AZ Central, police were called to Renaissance Hotel in downtown Phoenix at around 2.30am Monday in response to a noise complaint. A woman told officers that she and another woman were working as escorts and an argument over money in Sapp's room turned physical and spilled into the hallway. Sapp admitted to investigators he had paid one of the women for sex but he denied any assault. Investigators said both escorts sustained minor injuries consistent with a struggle. The women involved in the incident were cited by police and later released. Warren Sapp has been in trouble with the law several times in recent years. In 2010, he was arrested on a domestic battery charge, which was later dropped. Sidelined: The 42-year-old Hall of Famer was in Phoenix covering the big game for NFL Network, which has now suspended him without pay . Light on his feet: Sapp was the runner up on season 7 of Dancing With The Stars . As recently as last June, the 42-year-old football analyst and one-time contestant on Dancing With The Stars was picked up on a separate domestic battery charge in a Miami hotel. Sapp played 13 seasons in the NFL, first with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and later with the Oakland Raiders. He was inducted into the Football Hall of Fame in 2013 - his first year of eligibility. In recent years, Sapp, a divorced father of two, has been struggling with financial problems, which culminated in 2012 when he filed for bankruptcy listing $6.7million in debt, including hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid child support, property and IRS taxes. In November of that year, the Super Bowl champion was forced to sell his palatial home in Florida for $2.1million. Months earlier, Sapp auctioned off a 240-pair collection of rare Air Jordan sneakers worth $6,500 to pay his creditors.","Sapp, a member of the Football Hall of Fame, was in Phoenix Sunday covering the big game for NFL Network .

"When small and medium-sized stars die, they don't explode like their larger counterparts. Instead, they peacefully puff up, releasing their outer layers in the surrounding space and creating beautifully shaped clouds. 'Jupiter's Ghost' is an example of such a star, and an incredible image shows the event as it takes places – a process that could happen to our sun in seven billion years time. 'Jupiter's Ghost' lies some 3000 light-years away. It is an example of a white dwarf shedding its outer layers.  The blue glow filling the inner bubble represents X-ray emission from hot gas, heated up to two million degrees . The star has been named after the planet as it takes up about the same amount of space in the sky as the gas giant. The blue glow filling the inner bubble represents X-ray emission from hot gas, heated up to over two million degrees. The heat is being generated by shocks in the fast stellar winds, gusting at about 1,490 miles per second (2400 km/s) against the ambient gas. The green glow reveals cooler concentrations of gas seen in optical light through the emission of oxygen. The same process is expected to happen to our own sun after it consumes all the hydrogen fuel in its core. Astronomers expect the process to begin seven billion years from now, as our sun expands into a red giant shedding its outer layers . When stars with a mass similar to our sun approach the end of their lives, they swell up into cool red-giant stars. In a last gasp before death, they expel the layers of gas in their outer atmosphere. This exposes the core of the dying star, a dense hot ball of carbon and oxygen called a white dwarf. The white dwarf is so hot that it shines very brightly in the ultraviolet. The ultraviolet light from the white dwarf, in turn, ionises the gaseous material expelled by the star causing it to glow . This reveals the edge of the inner shell in contrast to the more diffuse gas making up the outer shell. The two flame-shaped features, visible in red to the upper right and lower left of the inner bubble, are pockets of even cooler gas, seen also in optical light through the emission of nitrogen. Jupiter's Ghost lies some 3,000 light-years away, and it is visible in the southern constellation Hydra, the water snake. The same process is expected to happen to our own sun after it consumes all the hydrogen fuel in its core. Astronomers expect the process to begin seven billion years from now, as our sun expands into a red giant shedding its outer layers. It will then collapse into a white dwarf and slowly cool down to the background temperature of the universe.","The white dwarf, Jupiter's Ghost, is located around 3,000 light-years away .

"The marriage license of mass murderer Charles Manson and a 26-year-old devotee who believes in his innocence is set to expire without a wedding taking place, prison officials said Monday. California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokesman Jeffrey Callison said weekend visiting for inmates passed without Manson getting married. Afton Elaine Burton and the 80-year-old Manson obtained a 90-day marriage license late last year. It expires Thursday, making this past weekend the couple's final opportunity to hold a wedding inside a visiting room at California State Prison, Corcoran. If the wedding is to happen, the couple must register for a new Kings County marriage license. No wedding yet: Star, 26, says she has been a fan on Manson, 80, since she was a teenager. They had planned to marry, but after 90 days with no wedding, their Kings County, California license to marry will expire . Burton, who goes by the name 'Star' and says she loves Manson, left her home halfway across the country and has spent the last nine years living near the Central California prison. Manson was convicted of killing seven people, including pregnant actress Sharon Tate, the wife of director Roman Polanski. Burton, who maintains websites espousing Manson's innocence, has not responded to recent requests seeking comment on the relationship. Too late: The infamous cult leader had his final opportunity to marry Burton during visitation hours over the weekend before the license expires Thursday . Shortly after obtaining the license, she told The Associated Press the nuptials were imminent: 'Y'all can know that it's true,' she said in November. 'It's going to happen.' Not long after that, Star was spotted fabric shopping and looking at white satin, possibly for a wedding dress to sew for the jailhouse ceremony. Star has been writing to Manson since she was a teen and even moved from her home in Illinois to the California town where he is imprisoned. Previous reports had said the two were already married, but a formal ceremony had yet to be held. The couple filed for a marriage license on November 7, which gave them just 90 days to carry out the nuptials. California Department of Corrections spokesman Jeffrey Callison previously stated that the wedding would have to take place on a visiting day, which happen on Saturdays, Sundays and certain holidays (including Thanksgiving). Callison said the couple would be allowed 10 guests from outside the prison, two guests from inside the prison and an officiant of their own choosing. However, the two are not be allowed to consummate their marriage since Manson's life in prison sentence bans him from receiving conjugal visits. In previous interviews, Star gushed about falling in love with Manson and his 'philosophy' as a teen, and how she already considered herself married to him. James McGrath, a New York City photo agency editor, said that he maintains contact with Burton and that she intends to obtain another 90-day license and go ahead with the marriage. Looked at fabrics: Manson was granted a marriage license to marry Star in November of last year, which would expire in 90 days. Soon after getting the license, Star was spotted out looking at fabrics, potentially to sew a dress with for the ceremony . Postponed? Star's wedding would have had to take place during visitation hours this past weekend but they missed the mark . What's more, Manson's son Matthew Roberts has just recently revealed that one of the reasons his father is set to wed Burton is so that the two can have a child. And while the two are not allowed conjugal visits, Roberts says of his father; 'Somehow he hopes to smuggle his sperm out of the prison.' He then added; 'He wants to see what it might be like to raise a child with more of his own ideas. He is starting to think about how he wants his legacy to be left once he’s gone.' Roberts also said in his interview with The Mirror that his father has wanted this for many years. 'Part of the whole thing with him marrying Star is that he would love to have kids and he was waiting for someone to come along and provide that,' he explained. Manson became notorious in 1969 as the leader of a 'family' of young killers. Manson follower Susan Atkins died of cancer behind bars, but Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel remain imprisoned. So do Charles 'Tex' Watson, Bruce Davis and Robert Beausoleil, who is expected to have a parole hearing Feb. 19. Manson is eligible for parole next in 2027. Matthew Roberts (above) the son of Charles Manson, says his father wants to have another child and Star would be the mother--though, they are not allowed conjugal visits so they'd have to somehow smuggle his sperm .","Manson, 80, and Afton Elaine Burton were issued a 90-day license in Kings County, California but their last available visitation day has come and gone .

"More than 957,000 immigrants who crossed the U.S. border illegally have received work permits since Barack Obama became president, a shocking report revealed on Monday. The Center for Immigration Studies uncovered documents through a Freedom of Information Act request, showing that more than 5.5 million new work permits were issued to aliens overall from 2009 to 2014. That was more than the number of green cards – lawful permanent residence authorizations – and temporary worker admissions in those years. The organization called it 'a huge parallel immigrant work authorization system outside the limits set by Congress that inevitably impacts opportunities for U.S. workers, damages the integrity of the immigration system, and encourages illegal immigration.' The 5.5 milliion number also includes 1.8 million work permits given to to immigrants with temporary visas or visa waivers.

More than 470,000 aliens on tourist visas have received the work permits since 2009; another 532,000 went to foreign students. The Obama administration gave more than 156,000 to dependents of guest workers and students, although deferal law prohibits it. 'Inexplicably,' wrote Center for Immigration Studies director of policy studies Jessica Vaughan. is  1,200 new work permits were issued to aliens who were denied asylum, were suspected of using fraudulent documents, were stowaways, or were refused at a port of entry.' Alabama Republican Senator Jeff Sessions called Monday for 'a full investigation.' 'This massive increase in the labor supply has occurred simultaneously with a steep drop in family incomes and a sharp rise in the number of Americans pushed out of the workforce,' he said. 'All jobs gains since the recession have gone to foreign workers, while the slack labor market has depressed median family incomes almost $5,000 in that time.' Sessions backs a GOP effort to hold up Department of Homeland Security funding past February 27 unless Obama drops his plan to mainstream 5 mllion or more illegal immigrants by guaranteeing them they win't be deported through at least January 2017. The president's plan also calls for green cards and work permits for most of them – but Monday's report suggests many already have the documents. A Gallup poll published on January 29 found that only 7 per cent of Americans want U.S. immigration policy changed in a way that would admit more immigrants.

Because of the circumstances, baby Bella suffered breathing problems, which subsequently starved her of oxygen. As a result of the incident, Leila, 29, decided to improve her wellbeing and has since shed 7st. Leila, from Derby, said: 'I put Bella through hell during birth.

Bella spent two weeks at Sheffield on life support before returning to the Royal Derby Hospital where her condition started to improve. Leila said her pregnancy had been difficult leading up to the point of birth, and blames her size.

"Billionaire casino mogul James Packer has been declared unwelcome in Sri Lanka, with the country's new Prime Minister announcing that the Australian should not 'come to the country in this lifetime'. The strong backlash from the Sri Lanka's new government come after Packer withdrew from long-standing plans to build a $350 million luxury resort in the country's 'commercial capital', Colombo. Packer scrapped his development plans in the wake of the government's ban on new casinos. Unphased: Australian billionaire James Packer (right) grins during a press conference at the newly-opened City of Dreams mega-casino in Manila on February 2, 2015 after the announcement by Sri Lanka's Prime Minister.

A woman past an advertising board at the proposed site for a resort and casino complex by Australia's Crown Resorts Ltd in Colombo January 29 . 'Packer says he will not come. Who asked you to come?' Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in a statement. 'Please don't come - not in this lifetime.' Sri Lanka's new government blocked three casinos approved by the former administration, among them Australian gaming mogul James Packer's Crown Resorts Ltd. Packer is unwilling to construct the resort without a casino and has also been deterred by the incoming government's choice to revoke tax concessions which had been approved under a former regime. Packer scrapped his development plans in the wake of the government's ban on new casinos as he is unwilling to construct the resort without a gaming venue . Packer's much-hyped Barangaroo development in Sydney is also under construction . The previous government, then led by president Mahinda Rajapaksa, had plans to turn Colombo into a regional gaming hub in the hope of boosting tourism. However, on Thursday the government revoked the 5 per cent tax rate that had been granted to Mr Packer. The deal would have seen Packer save up to $1bn in 10-year tax breaks. Mr Packer's project had been approved in December 2013 but construction was yet to commence. President Maithripala Sirisena was elected on January 8 this year and appointed Prime Minister Wickremesinghe on January 9. During their election campaigntook a firm anti-gaming stance . As a result, they received strong support, particularly from the Buddhist monks who have great influence in the country and have been vocal in their opposition of casinos. Today Packer was seemingly unphased by the announcement, grinning widely a press conference at the newly-opened City of Dreams mega-casino in Manila on February 2, 2015.

"A teenage boy was nicknamed 'devil hands' and ostracised by society because he was born with a rare deformity which left his arms permanently extended. But Mamadou, who is now 17, can finally move his left arm after an international medical charity learned of his plight and funded life-changing surgery. For the first time in his life, the teenager's hands and arms no longer stand vertical. And now he has been reunited with his family, who sent him 300 miles away to beg for money, because people would feel sorry for him. Scroll down for video . Mamadou, 17, from rural Guinea in West Africa can straighten his left arm for the first time after medical charity Mercy Ships performed a life-changing operation on the teenager . Mamadou was taunted by classmates who called him 'devil hands' and 'the claw', and his family sent him 300 miles away to the capital Conakry to beg, knowing people would take pity on him. But today the teenager can move his left arm and has been reunited with his family thanks to the Hertfordshire-based charity . As a child Mamadou, from rural Guinea, in West Africa, was taunted by classmates because of his disability, the cause of which is not known. 'Other children used to tease me,' he said. 'They called me 'devil hand' or the 'claw'. 'People didn't want to look at me, so although I could wash and dress myself I knew I'd never be able to have a normal job.' When Mamadou was 15 his parents sent him to live 300 miles in Conakry, the capital of Guinea with an aunt, to beg. He said: 'I was born with my elbows bent inwards and my wrists bent downwards. I couldn't straighten my arms but I learnt how to cope. 'Mum said people would feel sorry for me. She was right. I did quite well but it was a miserable life. 'As the eldest son, I wanted to support my family.' Describing what it was like to beg, Mamadou said: 'I wandered the streets from dusk 'til dawn. 'People handed over cash, wide-eyed at my condition. 'But I didn't want to be a beggar and dreamed of having my own market stall.' When Mamadou discovered a ship had docked nearby in the capital, the Mercy Ship, he went to see if they could help. He heard there were medical staff aboard this ship who might be able to help him. So, without telling his family, he visited it. Doctors warned Mamadou they wouldn't be able to operate on his right arm, for fear it would make his condition worse. But the teenager, pictured right with his mother and one-year-old sister said he was just delighted surgeons could do something to help him . Volunteer doctor Lydia Marx shows Mamadou his latest X-rays, showing his left arm straightened . Mercy Ships, which has a branch in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, is a charitable organisation which offers free medical care to those who would be otherwise unable to afford it. He went alone to see a nurse for an initial consultation. 'I told the nurse I could do so much more than people thought,' Mamadou said. 'I told her I wanted to support my family through begging but I didn't want to do it forever.' The nurse agreed treatment was necessary and Mamadou told his family. He said: 'My condition was a huge burden on my parents. 'There was so much disappointment and shame that I had to beg for the family to survive. 'I wanted to be certain Mercy Ships would do my surgery before I said anything to them.' In summer 2013 his mother and one year-old sister came to stay with him, while his father continued to support the rest of the family – without Mamadou's income. Volunteer plastic surgeon aboard the ship, Dr Tertius Venter, said Mamadou's condition was rarely seen and, due to the severity of the deformity, only his left arm could be repaired. 'If they had tried to fix my right arm, it would have only have made things worse for me,' Mamadou explained. 'I was just happy they could do anything at all.' With only four fingers on each hand, Dr Venter not only straightened Mamadou's arm but moved a finger to create a thumb as well. Mamadou said: 'My condition was a huge burden on my parents.'There was so much disappointment and shame that I had to beg for the family to survive' Mamadou has now been reunited with his family and is helping his uncle run a market stall . He said: 'I don't scare people away anymore. I can support my family properly and without shame' During his rehabilitation, the 16 year old practiced his English with the doctors and nurses helping his recovery. When he left, his uncle in Conakry offered him work on his market stall. Mamadou said: 'I don't scare people away anymore. I can support my family properly and without shame. 'One day I will own my own stall and maybe have a family of my own. I have Mercy Ships to thank for that. 'Without them I'd still be on the streets now. They are my guardian angels.'

"It sounds like something out of a science fiction movie, but scientists have discovered a way to treat jetlag with a flash of light. Researchers claim to have found a master switch in the brain which can ‘reset’ the human body clock. By flicking the switch with beams of light, the U.S. team has worked out how to influence the way people react to long-haul travel or working irregular hours. Using optical lasers - high powered flashes of light shone into the eye - the scientists think they may be able to alter the way people naturally feel at different times of day. Scroll down for video . Scientists claim they have found a way to cure jetlag - and possibly relieve the adverse health affects of working a night shift or help other conditions such as Seasonal Affective Disorder - by using flashes of light to flick the 'reset button' of the body clock . The initial tests on mice suggest the ‘reset button’ is in an area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, situated above the eye. The scientists, from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, found that they could alter the timing of activity in the brains of mice. Their results, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, reveal that the nocturnal mice they treated in this way were made to be more active during the day, when they would usually be asleep. The team think that being able to reset the body’s master biological clock could eventually lead to new treatments for conditions like seasonal affective disorder, reduce the adverse health effects of working a night shift and possibly even cure jet lag. Nearly all living things have an internal mechanism - known as the circadian rhythm or body clock - which synchronises bodily functions to the 24-hour pattern of the Earth’s rotation. Nearly all living things have an internal mechanism - known as the circadian rhythm or body clock - which rules our daily rhythms, including our sleep and waking patterns and metabolism. In humans and other mammals, the clock is regulated by the bodily senses, most importantly the way the eye perceives light and dark and the way skin feels temperature changes. Scientists found ‘re-setting’ the body’s clock can cause feelings of awakeness and alertness, even during times of day it is normal to sleep. They discovered using an optical laser – high powered flashes of light shone into the eyes – can flick the ‘reset button’. This is found in the area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, situated above the eye. In humans and other mammals, the clock is regulated by the bodily senses, most importantly the way the eye perceives light and dark and the way skin feels temperature changes. The mechanism rules our daily rhythms, including our sleep and waking patterns and metabolism. It also determines if we are a ‘morning’ person or an ‘evening’ person. But the pressures of modern living mean we are now increasingly working against our clocks and risking long term health problems from metabolic disease. Separate studies have found that people who work night shifts or who get too little sleep are more susceptible to conditions including depression, cancer and obesity. Professor Douglas McMahon, who led the research, said: ‘We found we can change an animal’s sleep-wake rhythms by artificially stimulating the neurons in the master biological clock, which is located in an area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.’ The team found that the suprachiasmatic nucleus was far more active during a mouse’s natural wake cycle. The scientists found they could artificially make the nervous cells in that part of the brain fire whenever they wanted, therefore making the mouse think it was time to be awake. They did this by genetically altering the cells to make them sensitive to light and then shining the laser into the eye. Nearly all humans have an internal mechanism, known as circadian rhythm, which rules sleep and waking patterns. When sunlight is perceived by the eye, signals are sent to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, where the circadian clock is housed (pictured in pink in the centre of the brain, with a red arrow running through it). Scientists found using optical lasers they could 'reset' the body clock in mice . The same thing could be replicated in humans by injecting them with a virus which alters the cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, then repeating the light treatment. The technique puts control of the body clock under human control for the first time. Researcher Michael Tackenberg said: ‘Of course, this exact approach isn’t ready for human use yet. ‘But others are making progress toward eventually using optogenetics as therapy.’","Scientists found the body clock's ‘reset button’ is in an area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, situated above the eye .

"An American tourist had to be rescued from a luxury cruise ship off the southern coast of Vietnam last night after he suffered a medical emergency. A photo shows the dramatic moment a specialised marine search and rescue team swept in and removed the 89-year-old man from the Seven Seas Voyager on a backboard after he suffered a possible heart attack, according to reports. The ship was met by rescuers some 30 nautical miles from Da Nang, Vietnam as it sailed into the Gulf of Tonkin towards Ha Long Bay, a Unesco World Heritage Site east of the capital, Hanoi. An American tourist was rescued from the Seven Seas Voyager after he suffered a possible heart attack . A spokesperson for the Da Nang Maritime Rescue Coordination Center told Thanhnien News that its members received a distress signal from the all-suite ship, operated by Miami-based Regent Seven Seas Cruises, a subsidiary of Norwegian Cruise Line. Doctors provided first aid instructions over the phone to the ship’s crew, and the man was brought ashore and rushed to hospital about four hours after the distress call, said Thanhnien News. It said strong winds and ‘rogue waves’ made it difficult to reach the cruise ship, but when rescuers arrived the man was able to speak to them despite suffering from chest pains and fatigue. He was reportedly in stable condition in hospital. MailOnline Travel has contacted Regent Seven Seas Cruises for comment. The cruise ship was sailing to Ha Long Bay from Da Nang when a distress call was placed (file photo) The all-suite luxury cruise ship is currently on a 34-night cruise from Singapore to Tianjin, China . The 670ft vessel is currently docked at Ha Long Bay and is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong and cruise across the South China Sea on Wednesday. According to an online itinerary, the Seven Seas Voyager is on a 34-night cruise from Singapore to Tianjin, China, a port city southeast of Beijing. The journey is scheduled to end February 21, although some passengers are on a shorter, 18-night trip that departed the same day and concludes in Hong Kong on Thursday. With nine decks and balconies for every room, the Seven Seas Voyager can accommodate up to 700 guests and nearly 450 crew.","Marine search and rescue team met the cruise ship near port of Da Nang .

"A former Playboy producer who turned to God to campaign against adult movies has been arrested for allegedly having sex with a 13-year-old girl. Pentecostal pastor Donny Pauling Jnr from Redding, California, was charged after a 16-year-old  told sheriffs the pair had been having a three-year affair. The 41-year-old, who claims to have convinced 500 women to appear in adult films, has also been accused of having sex with another under age girl. The alleged victim told detectives Pauling had bought her lingerie so she could pose for erotic photos. He is then believed to have posted the images on Reddit. Allegations: Pentecostal pastor and anti-porn crusader Donny Pauling Jnr from Redding, California, was arrested after a 16-year-old woman told sheriffs the pair had been having a three-year affair . She said to officers she had sex with Pauling because she believed he would buy her things and take her on trips as a result. Detective Robert C. Brokenbrough said Pauling first made inappropriate comments to the first victim about her lips and bottom. He then allegedly had sex with the girl in the summer of 2014. The officer also described how one of the victims found a recording device in Pauling's shower. When she asked what it was, he reportedly said that he wanted to know what her body looked like. The relationship began to unravel when the victim's mother found a picture of Pauling's crotch on her daughter's phone, according to authorities. According to the Marysville Appeal Democrat Deputy District Attorney Anu Chopra submitted 10 photos of the girl into evidence. Some of the photos included the girl posing topless, exposing her bottom. Others included other minors. Pauling, who worked in the porn industry for nine years from 1997, was first arrested in December for having sex with a girl under 14. But last week the Sutter County Deputy District Attorney leveled nine new charges related to a second victim. During a jailhouse interview in December, Pauling told CBS Sacramento Sutter County sheriff's captain Lewis McElfresh Jr tried to get him to have sex with his 16-year-old family member. He said: 'I came over to his house and he tried to get me to sleep with her. He said to me that she wanted to sleep with me.' Pauling quit the adult film industry in 2006 and started giving speeches about the detrimental impact adult films has on women. He has made a number of television and radio appearances around the world. One of his most recent appearances arrest was at the St. Isadore Catholic Church in Yuba City. Claims: One of the alleged victims told detectives during an interview Pauling, 41, had bought her lingerie so she could pose for erotic photos. He is then believed to have posted the images on Reddit . On his personal website he says: 'Yes, I was a porn producer for 9 years, contracting with Playboy and a group of other well known companies. Yes, I have become a Christian. And yes, I now speak publicly about what goes on behind the scenes here on this blog as well as at numerous Churches and Universities (including Yale University – WOOT!) across this great country of ours. 'But the reason I speak about what goes on 'behind the scenes' of porn is NOT because I have become a Christian. I do so because someone needs to do so. Porn is often portrayed as great fun, happy go lucky, and victimless. 'The fantasy shown on screen seems fantastic. The realities of porn, however, are not even close. I am a firm believer in freedom of speech and expression, and it is my personal belief that education, not legislation, is what changes hearts. Therefore it is my goal to educate so that those who hear can make a more informed decision.' During an appearance on ABC's Nightline, Pauling had a debate with two porn stars, during which he said: 'We're intelligent human beings. And when what we're doing is costing someone else and causing pain to someone else, we probably shouldn't be doing it.' Accusations: During a jailhouse interview in December, Pauling (left) said Sutter County sheriff's captain Lewis McElfresh Jr (right) tried to get him to have sex with his 16-year-old family member . Last year he spoke out after health expert Dawn Hawkins said pornography was behind a health crisis. He said he has personally seen the ill effects of the porn business on the women who appear in front of the camera. It came after Miriam Weeks, a 19-year-old women's studies student at elite Duke University,  caused a national stir recently when she came out as moonlighting Internet porn star Belle Knox. Pauling said he doubts she feels as 'empowered' as she has claimed when she revealed her identity. He is currently being held in Yolo County Jail with bail set at $5 million. He has denied the charges.","Donny Pauling from California, is accused of having sex with two minors .

"She's become a global style icon known for her polished looks and Queen Letizia of Spain's appearance today was no different. Looking composed in a plum-coloured suit, the Spanish monarch joined her husband at the ceremony of the Gold Medal of Merit in Fine Arts Ceremony at El Pardo Palace in Madrid, Spain. The 42-year-old, who had clearly carefully co-ordinated her outfit, matched her lipstick and accessories to her clothes. Scroll down for video . Queen Letizia attended the Gold Medal of Merit in Fine Arts Ceremony in Madrid, Spain with her husband . Despite cramming in several royal duties over the past few weeks - as well as helping her husband celebrate his birthday on Friday - the monarch was practically glowing as she presented awards at the event. The couple beamed and applauded as they handed out awards to creatives and proved they're still very much in love as they gazed longingly into each other's eyes. The couple are barely seen apart. At the end of last week, the couple visited the FITUR International Tourism Fair in Madrid when a well-wisher in a grey robe approached, brandishing a map. The royal power couple looked smart and stylish as they made their way through El Pardo Palace . The couple looked very much in love and exchanged a knowing glance as they watched the ceremony . The European style icon smiled broadly as she joined a round of applause for those celebrated . Ever composed, Letizia and husband King Felipe, who celebrated his 47th birthday on Friday, smiled broadly at the man before inspecting the map and moving on. Before that, she compered a meeting of the Spanish Association Against Cancer, an organisation of which she is president. Since taking the throne in June 2014 after former King Juan Carlos tearfully signed his abdication papers following a 36-year reign, Spain's Felipe and Letizia have become two of Europe's most popular royals. Letizia and husband King Felipe, who celebrated his 47th birthday on Friday, spoke intimately at the event . The couple married a year later in 2004 at the Almudena Cathedral, Madrid in a ceremony that was beamed around the world . But Felipe and Letizia have been lauded for their hard work, the couple, who have two daughters, Leonor, nine, and Sofia, seven, have also been praised for their good looks and impeccable dress sense. Felipe, 46, became engaged to 42-year-old Letizia Ortiz y Rocasolano, an award-winning broadcast journalist in 2003, after meeting when she carried out an interview with him. The couple married a year later in 2004 at the Almudena Cathedral, Madrid, in a ceremony that was beamed around the world - with over 25 million viewers in Spain alone tuning in. Since then, Letizia has become a global style icon thanks to her penchant for mixing home-grown labels and the high street.

"Accused murderer Gable Tostee is back behind bars after being jailed for an alcohol-fuelled chase with police across state borders in his father's car. Tostee will serve a six month sentence for his sactions behind the wheel while he was driving while allegedly up to four times over the legal limit in July last year, just three weeks before Warriena Tagpuno Wright fell to her death from the 14th floor of his Surfers Paradise apartment. The carpet layer, who had been out on bail for Ms Wright's alleged murder, will spend his 29th birthday behind bars, and possibly in a  protection wing to prevent his potentially being assaulted by fellow inmates. Tostee - who turns 29 in just 11 days - pleaded guilt in Tweed Heads court to speeding and being involved in a police pursuit which the court heard reached speeds of almost 200km/h and ended with sparks flying from Tostee’s tyre rims after officers deployed road spikes. Back behind bars: Accused balcony murderer Gable Tostee (pictured) is again  in prison - jailed for six months for a drunken car chase with police across state lines after which he was found to be four times over the legal limit for drink driving . He had been over the Queensland border at the Splendour in the Grass music festival at Byron Bay,  the Courier Mail reports, and was sleeping in his father’s car when friends woke him and asked him to drive them back to the Gold Coast. The court heard that NSW police saw a Ford Falcon travelling without number plates on the Pacific Highway at about 150km/h ans commenced pursuit, with the vehicle reaching 195km/h when they threw road spikes onto thehighway. Tostee didn't stop. The friction with the spikes caused sparks on his wheel rims before he finally drew up about 1km back into Queensland. Dad's car: Tostee (pictured leaving prison last November) borrowed his father's car for a booze-fuelled rise across into northern NSW and then back over the border where he was booked by Queensland police just weeks before he allegedly murdered Warriena Wright on a Tinder date . Tragic death: Warriena Wright (pictured) fell to her death from the 14th floor of Gable Tostee's Surfers Paradise apartment in the early hours of August 8 this year, just days before the 26-year-old was due to return home to New Zealand . A police test of his blood alcohol limit registered 0.2, or four times the legal limit. Before he was sent back to prison, his  barrister Peter O’Connor argued that Tostee was 'terrified' of returning to prison after being ‘brutalised’ in a Queensland jail last year. In successfully arguing for bail last November, Mr Tostee said he had been targeted by criminals in prison and that he feared for his safety. In the court on Monday, Tostee's parents sat stunned as he was led to the cells by police. He is due in Southport Magistrates Court in March on the drink driving charge. Since leaving the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre at Wacol in far western Brisbane on bail, Tostee had spent most of his time at his family's home at Carrara, west of Surfers Paradise,on strict bail conditions. He has ventured onto social media once and has tried to avoid being photographed or filmed by journalists. His father, Burleigh Heads carpet salesman Gray Tostee and replacement school teacher Helene put up $200,00 surety with their house as collateral for their son to be released on November 20 last year. Scroll down for video . Tinder date: Gable Tostee (pictured) says he did not murder Warriena Wright,following their meeting via the mobile dating app Tinder in Cavill Mall, Surfers Paradise, then on to his nearby high rise apartment . The Avalon apartments (above) in Surfers Paradise on Queensland's Gold Coast were the scene of the fatal fall by Warriena Wright 14 storeys to the ground at around 2.20am on August 8 this year . At hearings last year, prosecutors said that Tostee's alleged actions in locking 26-year-old victim Warriena Wright outside on a 14th floor balcony was akin to locking someone in a trunk to suffocate. Justice  Mullins told the court the case 'is not in any view a straightforward case of murder'. Mr Tostee was arrested a week later after Ms Wright's death. Following the first, adjourned part of his bail hearing, Tostee replaced his original legal team with renowned Queensland civil liberties lawyer, Terry O'Gorman. Tostee's lawyerssaid that while he was in prison, he was 'always on guard' against fellow inmates. Ms Wright died at around 2.20am, just hours after meeting Mr Tostee at Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise via the mobile dating app Tinder. Mr Tostee denies he murdered Ms Wright. Mr Tostee appointed Mr O'Gorman following the civil libertarian's comments about the release of court documents including an alleged transcript of Ms Wright's night with him, taped on his phone, and a damning police affidavit of what occurred between the two in the hours before Ms Wright's death. Strict conditions: Gable Tostee was living at his parents, Gary and Helene's house (pictured) while on bail,before he was returned for another lagging behind the bars of a Queensland prison . Fatal meeting: Warriena Wright (above, left) was holidaying on the Gold Coast after attending a friend's wedding, when the 26-year-old New Zealand bank clerk fell to her death from Gable Tostee's (above, right) high rise balcony apartment . Devastated: Warriena Wright (above, right) with sister, Reza, who was devastated by the death . The prosecution claims Tostee has a ‘bizarre indifference to Ms Wright's death’ and that she had been affected on the night of her death by alcohol in the form of a ‘white spirit’ made by him. Justice Mullins has made mention during the hearing of the accused’s autism and social anxiety. Crown Prosecutor Sarah Farnden told that hearing Mr Tostee was unlikely to have been on the balcony when Ms Wright plunged 14 storeys to her death. Justice Mullins described the Crown prosecutor's case for murder as 'weak' and 'difficult', but said a case of manslaughter would be 'strong'. Justice Mullins said a diagnosis of autism for Gable Tostee could have a bearing on how the court viewed what allegedly happened inside his Surfers Paradise apartment on the night Ms Wright died. 'If your client was not on the balcony, it makes the murder case a lot more difficult,' she told Mr Tostee's defence, 'but in the context of what happened in the apartment, I would think a manslaughter case is not weak.'

"Multimillionaire Tumblr founder ­David Karp has split with his girlfriend of five years. The 28-year-old whiz kid started dating psychology graduate student and trained chef Rachel Eakley in 2009 but the couple broke up at the end of 2014, it has emerged. The low-key couple, who lived together in a loft in Williamsburg, Brooklyn with their French-English Bulldog, were quiet about the breakup - but Eakley spoke about it briefly on her Tumblr page. She posted a message from another user remarking on the split, PageSix reported. 'They really suck, right?' the user wrote. 'And you built a house together, and probably got left with nothing since you weren't married... Scroll down for video . Split: Tumblr founder David Karp, pictured left attending Tumblr's 2014 Year in Review Party in Brooklyn on his own last November, has split from his long-term girlfriend Rachel Eakley, pictured right in May 2014 . 'Maybe it's better to hear someone agree that it sucks instead of someone telling you time heals all wounds blah blah blah?' Eakley responded to the message, calling it 'sweet and strange'. 'I don't really know what to say when I get stuff like this, so I mostly ignore it,' she wrote. 'You guys are cute. It's sweet that you worry about me and I think it's the best thing about Tumblr. 'I've been being purposefully quiet on this matter and will continue to be. I never really shared much about my relationships and probably won't start any time soon. Mine is more of a school's hard, tv's awesome, look at this food! kind of blog.' Karp, who grew up in the Bronx, New York, dropped out of high-school at age 14 to focus on computers - on his mother's advice, the New York Times reported. He founded Tumblr, a microblogging website with an estimated 17 million users, in 2007. In 2009, he started dating Eakley, a graduate student at NYU, according to the Times. In 2013, he sold his company for $1.1 billion to Yahoo! under CEO Marissa Meyer. He is worth an estimated $200 million, according to Forbes. At the time, Karp told PageSix: 'I don't even know how much money it is. I swear, I ­haven't given it a moment of thought.' Together: The couple, pictured with Eric Kuhn of Layer3 TV (left) and Politico's Gabe Brotman (right) at the Yahoo News/Tumblr White House Correspondents Dinner Brunch last May, lived together in Williamsburg . Success story: Karp, pictured with Obama at the White House last June, dropped out of high school at age 14 to concentrate on computers and sold Tumblr for $1.1 billion to Yahoo in 2013 . Karp, who turns up to press conferences and television appearances wearing shirts, jeans and hoodies, has previously spoken about his modest lifestyle - while denying he is a 'hipster'. He previously shared a small West Village apartment with Eakley but in 2012, they moved to a $1.6 million loft in south Williamsburg. The 1,700-square-foot duplex was featured in the New York Times' T Magazine. He explained how he didn't like seeing screens anywhere inside the home so kept it simple with one TV and a couch. The central feature of the modern home was a restaurant-grade kitchen for Eakley. They also told the magazine how they liked to take their Vespa to brunch at the weekends. He told the Times that he looks forward to philanthropic endeavors in the future - and joked that he should finally be able to afford to go to college.","David Karp and his girlfriend Rachel Eakley, a graduate student, broke up at the end of 2014 after they reportedly started dating in 2009 .

"A poignant tweet from slain journalist Kenji Goto has provided a powerful message for those mourning his loss after he was beheaded by Islamic State militants. The Japanese hostage, 47, is believed to have been killed by a fighter known as Jihadi John after a propaganda video purporting to show his execution was released on Saturday night. Social media users have now embraced a tweet posted by the freelancer four years ago which offers an insight into his time spent reporting in Syria and Iraq. It said: 'Closing my eyes and holding still. It's the end if I get mad or scream. It's close to a prayer. Hate is not for humans. Judgment lies with God. That's what I learned from my Arabic brothers and sisters.' A poignant tweet from slain journalist Kenji Goto (pictured) has provided a powerful message for those mourning his loss after he was beheaded by Islamic State militants . The message of tolerance, posted in September 2010, now has more than 20,000 retweets on Goto's account. It has resonated with thousands of Japanese Twitter users who have expressed admiration for Goto's reporting about the suffering of children in Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and Iraq. The journalist's mother and brother have spoken of their loss following confirmation that he had passed away, although the authenticity of the video has yet to be proven. 'Kenji has died, and my heart is broken. Facing such a tragic death, I'm just speechless,' Goto's mother Junko Ishido said. She added  that her son's death showed he was a kind gentle man, trying to save another hostage. The tweet says: 'Closing my eyes and holding still. It's the end if I get mad or scream. It's close to a prayer. Hate is not for humans. Judgment lies with God. That's what I learned from my Arabic brothers and sisters' The Japanese hostage is believed to have been killed by a fighter known as Jihadi John after a propaganda video purporting to show his execution was released on Saturday night (pictured is a still from video) 'I was hoping Kenji might be able to come home,' said Goto's brother, Junichi Goto, in a separate interview. 'I was hoping he would return and thank everyone for his rescue, but that's impossible, and I'm bitterly disappointed.' Mr Goto's Twitter account was verified  by his friend Toshi Maeda, who heads Tokyo-based venture Pacific Bridge, which created the mobile-video application Goto used for  his reports. 'He was like a brother to me,' he said. 'He was an inspiration. He was a friend and a colleague,' said Mr Maeda. Mr Goto's mother Junko Ishido said: 'Kenji has died, and my heart is broken. Facing such a tragic death, I'm just speechless' This is an alternative translation of Mr Goto's tolerant tweet from the Wall Street Journal . Yuki Watabe, a 15-year-old high school student in Sapporo, northern Japan, was among those who retweeted the message. 'He was such a wonderful person,' he said. 'He had a strong sense of doing the right thing.' An English translation of the tweet, originally sent in Japanese, was also circulating on Twitter. Mr Goto was shown with another hostage and his friend, Haruna Yukawa, in a video purportedly by the Islamic State group last month. Despite negotiations by the Japanese and Jordanian governments, Goto was depicted as dead in a weekend video released on social media accounts affiliated with IS. Yukawa was shown apparently dead in an earlier post. People gather in Amman, Jordan,  for a candle light vigil to condemn the killing of the two Japanese hostages, Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto .

"Nasa today hailed a proposal by President Barack Obama to boost spending for the US space agency by 2.9 per cent. The agency's administrator, Charles Bolden, said this will help Nasa make strides in the journey toward Mars, where a human mission is planned for the 2030s. However, Nasa could be axing its long-lived Mars rover Opportunity mission in 2016 after there were no allocated funds in the White House's fiscal year budget request. Scroll down for video . The agency's administrator, Charles Bolden (pictured), said that Nasa has made strides in the journey toward Mars - where a human mission is planned for 2030s - following the test flight of Orion . The space agency said this was no etched in stone, and they have not yet axed Opportunity — or the agency's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), which is in the same situation. The $18.5 billion budget request, also includes funding for developing a mission to Jupiter's moon Europa, and the agency's asteroid redirect mission (ARM). Although Obama's overall $4 trillion US budget plan faces an uphill climb through Republican-controlled Congress, support for the space agency tends to reach across bipartisan lines. 'President Obama is proposing a fiscal year 2016 budget of $18.5 billion dollars for Nasa, building on the significant investments the administration has made in America's space program over the past six years,' Bolden said. Nasa could be axing its long-lived Mars rover Opportunity mission in 2016 after there were no allocated funds in the White House's fiscal year budget request . The $18.5 billion budget request, also includes funding for developing a mission to Jupiter's moon Europa (pictured), and the agency's asteroid redirect mission . The proposed Nasa budget is up 2.9 per cent. The exploration budget — which includes Nasa's plans to grab either an asteroid or a chunk of an asteroid and haul it closer to Earth for exploration by astronauts — gets a slight bump in funding. But the details within the overall exploration proposal are key. The Obama plan would put more money into cutting-edge non-rocket space technology; give a 54 per cent spending jump to money sent to private firms to develop ships to taxi astronauts to the International Space Station; and cut by nearly 12 per cent spending to build the next government big rocket and capsule to carry astronauts. Congress in the past has cut the president's proposed spending on the private firms and technology and boosted the spending on the government big rocket and capsule. The president's 0.8 per cent proposed increase in Nasa science spending is his first proposed jump in that category in four years. It's also the first proposed jump in years in exploring other planets. It includes extra money for a 2020 unmanned Martian rover and continued funding for an eventual robotic mission to Jupiter's moon Europa. But the biggest extra science spending goes to study Earth. Obama's budget would cut aeronautics research 12 per cent from current spending and slash Nasa's educational spending by 25 per cent. It also slightly trims the annual spending to build the over-budget multi-billion dollar James Webb Space Telescope, which will eventually replace the Hubble Space Telescope and is scheduled to launch in 2018. 'That's a half-billion-dollar increase over last year's enacted budget, and it is a clear vote of confidence in you - the employees of Nasa - and the ambitious exploration program you are executing.' Bolden said key areas of focus for Nasa are continuing to prepare a manned mission to Mars, as well as developing advanced solar electric propulsion systems needed for an asteroid redirect mission. 'We have identified several asteroids that could be good candidates and will make a decision soon on a capture option.' Bolden also touched on a new mission in the works for Jupiter, but gave few details. 'Looking to the future, we're planning a mission to explore Jupiter's fascinating moon Europa, selecting instruments this spring and moving toward the next phase of our work.' In 2011, Nasa sent a billion-dollar solar-powered spacecraft called Juno on a five-year journey to Jupiter. Juno, which should arrive in July 2016, was launched just over two weeks after the final space shuttle mission returned to Earth and the 30-year program was shuttered for good. The European Space Agency already has an unmanned spacecraft in the works to explore Jupiter's icy moons, including Europa. The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or Juice, will be launched in 2022, arriving at Jupiter in 2030 for a mission lasting three years. The proposed Nasa budget is up 2.9 per cent.

"Using a computer, tablet or smartphone in the hour before bedtime significantly delays sleep onset, according to research . Teenagers  who spend more time watching TV, using tablets such as iPads and playing electronic games take longer to fall asleep and get poorer quality rest, warn researchers. Screen time of more than four hours a day results in a 49 per cent greater risk of taking longer than an hour to go to sleep. In particular, using a computer, smartphone or Mp3 players in the hour before bedtime significantly delays sleep onset. Researchers are calling for improved guidelines on the healthy use of electronic devices. Some experts in child health recommend against having a TV or computer in children's bedrooms to reduce screen exposure before bedtime. The latest study says this advice should be extended to other technology including smartphones. A new study suggests the growth in use of electronic media devices by children could harm physical and mental health. In the US, paediatric guidelines recommend that total screen time should be limited to less than two hours per day of educational, nonviolent programmes. There are currently no formal guidelines in the UK. The latest study from Norway involved almost 10,000 teenagers, all of whom were part of the youth@hordaland study in 2012. The 16-19-year-olds were asked how much screen time they spent outside school hours, and on what activities, for any of six electronic devices: computer; tablet, smartphone; Mp3 player; games console; and TV. They were also asked questions about their sleep routine on weekdays and at weekends: when they normally went to bed and got up; how much sleep they needed to feel rested; and how long it took them to get to sleep. Girls spent significantly longer on their computers chatting online while boys spent longer playing games on consoles and computers. Almost all of the teens said they used one or more electronic devices within an hour of going to bed. The study found poorer quality sleep was significantly linked to more time spent on such devices, and it often took more than an hour to drop off. A period of more than half an hour is normally defined as long 'sleep latency' in adults, say the researchers in the online journal BMJ Open (to subs must credit like this). Total daytime screen use of more than four hours was linked to a 49 per cent greater risk of taking longer than 60 minutes to fall asleep. Spending more than two hours on screen devices after school was strongly linked to both longer sleep onset latency and shorter sleep duration. On average, the teens said they needed 8-9 hours of sleep to feel rested. But those who spent more than two hours emailing or chatting online were more than three times as likely to sleep for less than five hours. Screen time of more than four hours a day results in a 49 per cent greater risk of taking longer than an hour to go to sleep . Those spending more than four hours in front of any screen were 3.5 times as likely to sleep for less than five hours. Computers were the device most likely to cause problems. Multi-taskers who used more than one device were also more likely to take longer to fall asleep and get less rest than those on one device. Teens who used four or more devices were a quarter more likely to take more than an hour to fall asleep than those who used just one. Using two to three devices increased the risk by a half of getting less than five hours rest and four or more devices increased the risk to 75 per cent. Dr Mari Hysing, of Uni Research Health, Bergen, said screen use may simply replace sleeping time or it may interfere with sleep by stimulating the nervous system. It is also possible the light emitted from electronic devices may interfere with a teenager's body clock, or circadian rhythm. Greater parental involvement in technology use could be the way forward, she added. She said 'The recommendations for healthy media use given to parents and adolescents need updating, and age specific guidelines regarding the quantity and timing of electronic media use should be developed. 'The current recommendation is not to have a TV in the bedroom. 'It seems, however, that there may be other electronic devices exerting the same negative influence on sleep, such as PCs and mobile phones. 'The results confirm recommendations for restricting media use in general.'","Watching TV and using tablets means it could take longer to fall asleep .

"Coles and Woolworths have stepped up their discounting wars and started slashing the prices of their top selling bread brands. Woolworths fired the first shot last year when it discounted its Homebrand White Bread from $1 to 85 cents, and Helga's range from $5.39 down to $3.50. Coles retaliated on Tuesday by cutting prices of top brands including Abbott's Village Bakery, Tip Top, and Wonder White by up to 34 per cent after a previous round of discounts last month. Coles and Woolworths are slashing the prices of their top selling bread brands including Wonder White . Consumer expert Dr Gary Mortimer said the rivalry between the country's two biggest supermarkets had been progressing through different major food categories . Coles Smart Buy White Toast Bread was also slashed from $1 to 85 cents last September. Woolworths will hit back on Wednesday by cutting the price of Sunblest bread from $2.88 to $2.50. Consumer expert Dr Gary Mortimer said the rivalry between the country's two biggest supermarkets had been progressing through the major food categories. 'This will be referred to as the bread wars, the fight has been taken to the bakery,' Dr Mortimer, from the Queensland University of Technology, told Daily Mail Australia. 'The fight has already been had in meat and milk. 'It's been a very clear staged approach.' Woolworths fired the first shot in the 'bread wars' last year when it discounted its Homebrand White Bread from $1 to 85 cents, and Coles followed suit . Abbott's Village Bakery Light Rye: Coles was $5.39, cut to $3.40 and Woolworths was $5.39, cut to $3. Tip Top The One: Coles was $4.19, cut to $3 and Woolworths was $3.98, cut to $3 . Dr Mortimer said the supermarkets chose one major category at a time and slash prices in an effort to increase foot traffic and sales. 'They identify the best-selling lines and which ones they can they mark down drastically to create a draw card,' he said. Coles . Abbott's Village Bakery down from $5.19 to $3.40 (down 34 per cent) Tip Top 9 Grain down from $4.29 to $3 (down 30 per cent) Tip Top The One down from $4.19 to $3 (down 28 per cent) Wonder White / Wholemeal down from $4.19 to $3.30 (down 21 per cent) Helga's Bread Varieties 680g-850g (excluding low carb varieties) down to $3.50 (down 35 per cent) Coles Brand Bread Varieties 700g down to $2 (down 13 per cent) Coles Smart Buy down from $1 to 85c (down 15 per cent) Woolworths . Homebrand bread down from $1.00 to $0.85 . Helga's down from $5.39 to $3.50 . Wonder White down from $3.80 to $3.30 . Sunblest down from $2.88 to $2.50 . 'Hopefully the customer will buy the cheap bread, but they'll also buy more expensive things. 'They pick from those categories most Australian families will buy consistently - it will probably be eggs in the next six months' time.' On Tuesday, Coles announced it was slashing prices on a range of bread brands. The Abbott's Village Bakery range was cut from $5.19 to $3.40. Woolworths has dropped its Abbotts Village Bakery prices from $5.39 to $3. Coles also dropped Tip Top 9 Grain prices from $4.29 to $3 (Woolworths sells it for $4.39), and Tip Top The One from $4.19 to $3. Woolworths has dropped Tip Top The One from $3.98 to $3. Coles also cut the price of Wonder White from $4.19 to $3.30 – the same price it sells for at Woolworths. Dr Mortimer said Coles and Woolworths copied each other in terms of marketing and discounting because it was effective. 'They know that's how they get the punters in the door, by just replicating,' he said. 'Coles do ""Down Down"", Woolworths do ""Cheap Cheap"".' Dr Mortimer said the move by Coles and Woolworths to discount bread was a deliberate strategy to avoid backlash from the dairy and meat industries following the much-publicised 'milk wars'. 'They won't touch milk anymore, that's still getting a lot of bad media coverage,' he said. 'There are very large lobby groups around dairy farmers. The move to bread by Coles and Woolworths is a deliberate strategy to avoid backlash from the dairy and meat industries . 'Where we're not seeing critics is around bread, because it's mass produced reasonably cheaply out of factories.' Brett Hosking, president of the Grains Group of the Victorian Farmer's Federation (where grain was the state's biggest exports last year), said the bread wars were disappointing for farmers. 'It devalues what we do, effectively,' Mr Hosking told Daily Mail Australia. 'I guess one of the biggest challenges we're facing is our rising cost of production. 'Whilst our costs are rising greater than CPI it's disappointing when supermarket execs think the product isn't really worth as much.' But Mr Hosking said the bread wars would not have the direct effect on grain growers that the milk wars had on farmers. 'I don't believe we'll see significant differences in grain price because we are a bulk export commodity,' he said.","Woolworths fired first shot by cutting Homebrand White Bread to 85 cents .

"The only cinema in Baghdad pulled 'American Sniper' last week after a phone call from a senior government official following sold-out showings and outbursts from audiences. Those who went to screenings said reactions to the film were mixed, with some viewers cheering on Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle as others responded with anger. The Washington Post reports that Fares Hilal, who operates the movie theater, says he stopped screenings after only a week because a Ministry of Culture official threatened to fine and close the cinema. Scroll down for video . Out: The only cinema in Baghdad pulled 'American Sniper' after a phone call from a senior government official following a contentious week of sold-out showings and outbursts from attendees . 'He told me the film insults Iraqis,' Hilal said. 'If we show it, we will be criticized. But if we don’t, we lose money. A lot of people wanted to see this film.' The theater opened last year in the upscale Mansour Mall in central Baghdad, and has screened other new releases like 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' in 3D. In spite of the rejection from the ministry, most screenings of the film had sold out, with some Iraqis having to buy their tickets to the flick a week in advance, the Global Post reports. Mall-goers say action movies are a hit at the theater, and during 'American Sniper,' attendees seemed to become absorbed in the film and even cheered Kyle on. 'Some people watching were just concentrating,' said Gaith Mohammed, about one scene in which Kyle radios for permission to shoot a possible threat. 'Others were screaming, ‘F---, shoot him! He has an IED, don’t wait for permission!' There were brief outbursts of anger from crowds, one during the scene in which Kyle, played by Bradley Cooper, kills a child holding a rocket-power grenade launcher. Entertainment: The cinema at Mansour Mall, an upscale shopping center in central Baghdad attracts patrons eager for action flicks like 'American Sniper' Take your seats: The six-screen movie theater shows new releases from Hollywood as well as some Arabic cinema .

Sarmad Moazzem believed the movie was too simplistic - failing to differentiate between Shiite militias and Sunni extremists, such as al-Qaeda - and portrayed Iraqis only as terrorists. Moazzem, who said he served alongside American soldiers with an Interior Ministry logistics division, stressed 'there are some people who loved the Americans and wanted them to stay to help rebuild our country.' Ahmed Kamal, like many Iraqis, only saw the film in pirated form after downloading it from the Internet, saying he didn't want to pay for a movie that called Iraqis 'savages.' 'I wasn’t prepared to spend money to see it,' Kamal said. 'It portrays Americans as strong and noble, and Iraqis as ignorant and violent.' But Yasser Bakr, a teenager who operates a carousel at the mall, saw the movie and wasn't offended by the depiction of his country. 'It’s just a movie,' he said. 'About something that happened in the past.' The film has also been polarizing in the United States - though almost exclusively stoking anger among political commentators. 'There’s a lot of anger in this country and the people who go see this movie are people who are very angry,' said former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean on Real Time with Bill Maher, adding he thinks there is overlap between the Tea Party and viewers of 'American Sniper.' In theaters, it has been a smash success, earning 247.75million in box office receipts after breaking the record for biggest January opening weekend ever.","The manager of the theater at Mansour Mall stopped showing the film after a Ministry of Culture threatened to fine him and close the cinema .

"A growing number of young women are fuelling dangerous eating disorders by taking 'selfies' to document their weight loss, a leading expert has warned. Dr Alex Yellowlees, medical director and consultant psychiatrist at the Priory hospital group, said more and more young women suffering from eating disorders are taking pictures of themselves and sharing them with friends. This competitive selfie dieting 'diaries' trend, he says, is creating damaging psychological pressures that can exacerbate anorexia and other potentially fatal illnesses. Selfies - a self-portrait photograph taken with a hand-held digital camera or camera phone - have become increasingly popular among social media users over the last few years. Millie Mackintosh has been criticised by anorexia campaigners after her rapper husband Professor Green said a photograph of her was a 'thinspiration' Dr Yellowlees said: 'Some people will take repeated pictures of themselves at various stages of their illness, and send them to others. 'They want to keep a record of their illness and see for themselves, as it were, the progress they think they are making towards anorexia, but they will also transmit the images to other sufferers on occasions. 'It's the younger women doing this. They tend to be in their teens or in their twenties and really into their phones. 'It's only become very apparent to me in the last year. Patients have talked to me about it. 'It's a reflection of the social media age. Devices make it so easy to do and it is a way of people expressing themselves and their attitude towards the illness. It's a new and rising trend to me, and it's certainly happening among increasing numbers of young people.' Student Holly Temple, who took 'thinspiration selfies' to track her dramatic weight loss, spoke out last year to warn others of the dangers. The 17-year-old, from Woking, Surrey, uploaded pictures of her shrinking frame onto a password protected blog as motivation to continue to lose more weight. Geordie Shore star Vicky Pattison regularly posts 'skinny selfies' documenting her dramatic wright loss . She reached six stone and was on the verge of being hospitalised for the second time, before something finally 'clicked' and she began to regain weight. Dr Yellowlees, who works at the Priory Hospital Glasgow, said in some cases, young women were encouraged to reduce their weight to dangerous levels by looking at so-called 'thinspiration' websites. Thinspiration websites, some which display images of concave stomachs and protruding ribs, include blogs written by extreme dieters who upload their 'tips and tricks' to encourage others with eating disorders to lose more weight. Some sites, and hashtags, promote the pursuit of the 'thigh gap', when women try to become so thin that their thighs do not touch even when their feet are together. Disturbing photographs and internet blogs are often accompanied by 'thinspirational' messages such as 'food is the enemy' and 'starving for perfection'. Holly Hagan (left) and Charlotte Crosby (right), who both starred in Geordie Shore, also regularly post pictures of themselves documenting their weight loss . One site, for example, suggested that grumbling stomach noises were in fact 'applause' for self-starvation. Dr Yellowlees's warning, ahead of Eating Disorders Awareness Week (23-27 February), came as the Priory Group, - the UK's largest provider of eating disorders treatments outside the NHS - disclosed it had seen a 15 per cent rise in adult patients admitted with eating disorders in just one year, increasing to 535 in 2014, up from 463 in 2013. Although the largest group of patients were those aged between 18 and 25, with 169 admissions, the largest increase in admissions occurred between those aged 36 and 45 which almost doubled from 40 to 73. Dr Yellowlees said that an increasing number of women in their thirties and forties were also seeking help for eating disorders, caused in part by the stress of juggling a career with a husband, home and children.

"Funny, isn’t it, how trends come around again. I started at Marks & Spencer in the early Seventies, when bell-bottom flares and denims filled the racks. Now, in 2015, they’re back in fashion. What I’m more surprised about is seeing a Seventies throw-back in our politics. Labour’s attack this week on a major British business smacked of the destructive anti-business mood that went out of political fashion decades ago. Stefano Pessina — the boss of Boots the chemist — voiced his fears about the implications of a Labour government. Scroll down for video . Stuart Rose (left), who left M&S in 2010 after saving the company, has branded Ed Miliband (right) a '1970s throwback' following comments which he says 'smack of anti-business mood' Some seemed unhappy about the fact that Mr Pessina is not a British citizen, with the view that somehow he had no right to comment. But more than 40 of the chief executives in the FTSE 100 companies are not British — and a quarter of the chairmen aren’t British either. Why should they be disqualified from speaking about matters which are directly their concern? As a man responsible for 70,000 workers — that’s 70,000 livelihoods supporting 70,000 families — Mr Pessina was perfectly entitled to speak out. What happens in Westminster has a direct impact on his employees and his customers. But Labour reacted with furious attacks. There was a tide of derision from their backbenches; personal jibes about Mr Pessina and his ‘big mansion’; even slights against the boss of one of our best-loved High Street chains from the shadow business secretary himself. Though some might dismiss this as just another political spat, to me it is more significant. It marks a turning of the tide that every business and worker in the country should pay attention to. For a long time, we seemed to have reached a consensus about business in Britain. Mainstream politicians agreed that business was not the enemy but the vital engine that kept our economy moving, creating jobs and opportunities. Stefano Pessina voiced fears about the implications of a Labour government, prompting Labour to react with furious attacks . There was an agreement that enterprise should be rewarded; that wealth-creators should not be squeezed ‘until the pips squeak’, as the Labour Chancellor Denis Healey is alleged to have said in the Seventies — but that they should be welcomed for the contribution they make to our economy, and the dynamism they bring. The old days of punitive taxes on business-people, of class war and the stirring of resentment, seemed hopelessly old-fashioned. Politicians on both the Right and Left were united in a belief that a strong economy was not, in the end, built by officials in Whitehall, but by enterprising individuals on High Streets and in offices up and down the country — and that beyond reasonable regulation and taxation, governments should let them get on with the job. That was then. Now, Ed Miliband and the Labour Party have blown that consensus apart. For the past few years, there has been a steady drum-beat of anti-business policies from Labour. It started with a speech in which Ed Miliband labelled businesses as ‘predators’. Labour has mooted a National Insurance rise that would squeeze small firms and make it less attractive to take on new workers. It has proposed a hike in corporation tax — a policy which might play well to the gallery, but which would see British jobs being lost overseas. Their ill-advised energy price freeze policy threatened investment into the UK. Most important, Labour lacks a clear and credible plan to deal with Britain’s remaining budget deficit. Four decades of experience have taught me that businesses crave one thing above anything else: certainty. As a man responsible for 70,000 workers  Mr Pessina, chief executive of Boots (pictured), was perfectly entitled to speak out, according to Lord Rose . If business leaders are to grow their firms, if investors are to put their money in the UK, they need to know that our economy is built on firm foundations. The prospect of more borrowing, spiralling interest rates and falling confidence is a worrying one, to say the least. And all this is happening against the backdrop of a turbulent global economy — an economy in which winning deals, trading and making a living is a daily battle for businesses in Britain. I know how competitive this global economy is. If Britain gets bogged down in another era of sky-high taxes, over-regulation and business bashing, the jobs and the investment will simply go elsewhere — and the impact will be felt in shuttered shop fronts, empty High Streets and lengthening dole queues. The M&S former chief says there has been a steady drum-beat of anti-business policies from Labour, starting with a speech in which Ed Miliband (pictured) labelled businesses as ‘predators’ These are the very possible real repercussions of anti-business policy and rhetoric. In my view, we need to back British businesses to the hilt; to hear their concerns and not attack them for having them. Last year, during the Scottish referendum, we saw how attacks on businesses can quickly spin out of control. Businesses that voiced their concerns about the impact of independence — and stated their support for the Union — faced withering criticism and threats of boycotts. One senior politician even talked about a ‘day of reckoning’ for businesses and banks that had dared to speak about the potential downsides of independence. It was an extraordinary comment — a chilling comment — for any politician to make during what was a largely good-tempered debate about Scotland’s future. But it underlined the danger of resorting to abuse and personal attacks when people raise genuine concerns. In a healthy, thriving democracy, people must be free to speak out without fear or favour. So I have a suggestion for Ed Miliband and Labour. When you run a major retail business, as I have done, and a lot of your time is spent in boardrooms and meetings, it’s a good idea every now and again to ‘walk the floor’ — to get down onto the shop floor, get to know your staff, speak to customers and generally find out what is happening in the real world. Miliband and his team should try doing the same. They should ‘walk the floor’ in Britain’s businesses to experience the reality they face: earning a living, keeping overheads down, paying the wages each month. If they did, they would see that most firms, large or small, are made up not of greedy tycoons, but of men and women who work incredibly hard, who often commute long hours and who pay their taxes — like the 70,000 people who work for Boots. This is the real face of British business. They aren’t the enemy. They are the backbone of our economy — and they deserve the support and respect of our politicians.","Labour's attack on major British business smacked of destructive mood .

"Energy firms have robbed the average family of £145 over the past year by failing to pass on a sharp fall in wholesale prices, it is claimed today. The estimate, by consumer group Which?, equates to a total extra cost of £2.9billion. The figures paint a damning picture of the Big Six energy companies, which stand accused of lining their own pockets while customers struggle to pay bills. The firms – British Gas, SSE, Npower, E.on, EDF and Scottish Power – have announced small price reductions in recent weeks, ranging from £9 to £35 a year. Energy firms including British Gas have been  accused of lining their own pockets while customers struggle to pay bills . However, the wholesale price of gas has fallen by 28 per cent compared with a year ago, while the price of electricity is down by 15 per cent. Just last week, energy regulator Ofgem published average profit margin figures for the major suppliers, showing an increase of almost 50 per cent in the past year. The watchdog is so concerned that energy firms are failing to pass falling prices on to customers that it has ordered a wide-ranging investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). While this could change how energy firms operate in the long term, Ofgem is unable to force them to cut bills immediately. Which? tracked wholesale prices and energy bills to establish whether customers were getting a fair deal. A spokesman said: 'We analysed the costs to suppliers of buying wholesale energy since 2013 and compared this against what consumers have paid for wholesale costs through energy bills in the same period. Big Six energy firms have robbed the average family of £145 over the past year by failing to pass on a sharp fall in wholesale prices, it has been claimed . 'We found that the failure of retail prices to align with wholesale costs has cost consumers £2.9billion over the last year, an equivalent of £145 per household on standard tariffs.' Which? found that a raft of sharp price rises by firms on gas just before winter 2013 were not justified by any change in the wholesale cost. It said customers' bills have since remained high, despite continuing falls in what the firms are paying. Its figures suggest recent price cuts on gas of between 1.3 and 5.1 per cent should have been much higher – between 8.8 and 10.3 per cent – while firms could have also cut electricity prices by up to 10 per cent. The group has submitted its findings to the inquiry being carried out by the CMA and to the Treasury, which is also investigating. Which? wants the CMA to set up a new regime that will allow Ofgem to establish a 'price to beat'. This would be a gas and electricity tariff it considers fair to consumers, while also allowing the energy firms to make a decent profit. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Our analysis places a massive question mark over how suppliers have been setting prices over the last two years. They now need to explain to their customers why bills don't fall further in response to dropping wholesale prices.' Energy firms have attempted to blame Labour for the fact that recent price cuts have been smaller than customers would like. Ed Miliband pledged to freeze prices until 2017 should Labour win the General Election, making firms reluctant to reduce tariffs. Energy UK, which speaks for the energy firms, said bills are now falling. Chief executive Lawrence Slade said: 'The Which? calculations are based on very many assumptions and do not reflect the cheaper deals we are seeing. 'Because energy companies buy ahead to fix prices and to plan … the gas and electricity we are using today has already been paid for.'","Energy firms have 'robbed' the average family of £145 over the past year .

"Six months after announcing his breakup with fashion blogger Garance Dore, The Sartorialist's Scott Schuman has finally revealed why the once loved-up couple chose to call time on their highly-publicized relationship – and why they decided to officially announce their split by posting statements online. The street style photographers, who met at Paris Fashion Week in 2007, were together for seven years before revealing on their respective blogs last August that they had gone their separate ways. Mr Schuman, 47, told Isaac Likes that he and Miss Dore didn't want end their relationship on their blogs, but they felt like they had to in order to 'make it clear that there was no scandal'. Drama free: Scott Schuman (right) said he and Garance Dore (left) announced their breakup on their blogs in order to avoid speculation about their separation after seven years together . Stylish split: The street style photographer, who met Miss Dore in 2007, noted that they had broken up last August in order to avoid being seated next to each other during September's fashion shows . 'We felt that we were fine, everything’s cool, and we’re still good friends, so we didn’t want anyone else to think or suggest otherwise,' he said. 'It wasn’t easy to do. We didn’t like doing it, It wasn’t fun for either one of us, but out of respect we decided to do it that way.' Mr Schuman also noted that he and Miss Dore had broken up a 'little bit' before they released their separate statements. The photographer explained that they decided to make their separation public because it happened just a few weeks before fashion week and they wanted to avoid being seated together at shows. 'We’re fine, but when you’re just freshly broken up you don’t necessarily want to sit next to your ex-girlfriend at a fashion show,' he said. According to Mr Schuman, he and Miss Dore 'still text' and 'still get along' – and he even admitted to recently contacting his ex to get her opinion on a potential job. 'She’ll never be out of my life, but it’s tough because I still think she’s great. It’s one of those tough things when you see a girl that you still really like but you can’t make it work.' He added that they were just brought up differently and he 'can't blame her for anything'. Always amicable: Six months after their breakup, Mr Schuman said that they still communicate. He also noted that he still thinks his ex is 'great' Better off as friends: The 47-year-old said that even though they weren't able to make their relationship work, he doesn't blame her for anything . Mr Schuman launched The Sartorialist in 2005, while Miss Dore started her eponymous blog a year later. Shortly after they met in 2007, Mr Schuman left his wife of 20 years. He and Miss Dore began dating within months, and she eventually left her home France and moved to New York to be with him. In 2012, the duo won a CFDA media award for their work and cemented their status as a fashion power couple. But two years later, Mr Schuman and Miss Dore had taken to their blogs to share short statements about their separation. 'We’ve shared so much of our creative life (and more) with you, our readers, so we thought it was right to let you know about it,' Miss Dore wrote on her site. Mr Schuman added: 'Our mutual respect and admiration for each other have left us still great friends.'","The fashion bloggers announced that they had broken up by posting statements on their respective websites last August .

"Elnathan John, a writer and lawyer living in Nigeria’s capital Abuja, used the current measles outbreak in the U.S. to poke fun at American’s overreaction to the Ebola virus . A Nigerian writer has used the current measles outbreak in the U.S. to poke fun at American’s overreaction to the Ebola virus during which some politicians called for a travel ban on impacted west African countries. Elnathan John, a writer and lawyer living in Nigeria’s capital Abuja, jokingly called for screenings to prevent the highly contagious measles virus from spreading abroad. ‘Our thoughts are also with the measles-ravaged country America. I hope we are screening them before they come to Africa,’ he tweeted on Sunday. Concerns about people from African countries bringing Ebola into the U.S. reached fever pitch last October after Liberian Thomas Eric Duncan died in a Texas hospital. Politicians, including Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry, quickly called for an air travel ban from countries hit hardest by the virus which is actually much harder to catch than measles. A Reuters/Ipsos poll last October also found that more than 70 percent of Americans supported such a ban on civilian air travel, although experts questioned how useful such a measure would be in containing the disease. Scroll down for video . John jokingly called for screenings to prevent the highly contagious measles virus from spreading abroad . John’s comment has been retweeted more than 15,000 times, with some people applauding him for his snark and others taking offense, reports Raw Story. He later confirmed via another tweet that he had been joking. 'I’m just kidding America. You know I love you – measles, guns, Kim Kardashian and all,' he tweeted. There remains a growing concern that the U.S. could become gripped by a measles epidemic, according to the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, said his agency is 'very concerned' about the possibility of a large measles outbreak in the U.S. His fears come as a growing number of people who have not been vaccinated against the disease are being exposed to the rest of the population. The outbreak is due in to  the ‘anti-vaxxer movement’ - parents who believe that childhood vaccinations can cause autism in children. Vaccination: A child gets a vaccinated, but in southern California, eight percent of kindergarteners fail to get the required immunizations against measles, mumps and rubella . Health officials have pushed back against the movement, pointing out a study often cited by anti-vaxxers has been thoroughly discredited. In the midst of a measles outbreak, President Barack Obama has been telling parents to get their kids vaccinated. The president said a major success of civilization is the ability to prevent diseases that have been devastating in the past. More than 100 cases of the measles have been reported in 14 states since last month. Many cases have been traced directly or indirectly to Disneyland in Southern California. Frieden said in an interview on CBS' 'Face the Nation' on Sunday: 'What we've seen is, as over the last few years, a small but growing number of people have not been vaccinated. John confirmed via a second tweet than he had been joking and then listed the things he loves about America including 'gun and Kim Kardashian' Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC said his agency is 'very concerned' about the possibility of a large measles outbreak in the U.S. 'That number is building up among young adults in society, and that makes us vulnerable. 'We have to make sure that measles doesn't get a foothold in the U.S. It's been actually eliminated from this country for 15 years. 'All of our cases result, ultimately, from individuals who have traveled and brought it back here.' At last count, there were 102 reported cases of measles in 14 states across the country. However, this looks set to grow. The CDC has now launched an aggressive campaign to combat the spread of the disease which can be highly contagious.","Elnathan John used the current measles outbreak in the U.S. to poke fun at American’s overreaction to the Ebola virus .

"Dr Irfan Zafar says the 24-hour surgery is a 'better option' than running a blocked A&E . A hospital is set to open the first 24-hour GPs' surgery in Britain in a bid to ease its A&E crisis. The pioneering service will mean that people who have come to A&E in desperation as they are unable to get an appointment with a GP will no longer clog up waiting times for emergency care. It has been launched in an attempt to solve the major crisis in emergency care at Royal Blackburn Hospital which was so overwhelmed last month that 18 ambulances were seen queuing outside the A&E department. It is thought the move could be copied by health trusts across the UK to help ease the worst winter A&E crisis on record. Waiting times in A&E departments around the UK are at a record high - partly because so many patients are unable to get an appointment with their family doctor. Doctors say the ‘groundbreaking’ plans in Blackburn will involve all 90 GPs from across the borough put on a rota to cover shifts at the 24-hour centre. Nurses and support workers will also be seconded in to cater for minor injuries and ailments, such as an infected wound, sprains or minor burns. Patients who turn up at A&E will be referred to doctors there on a walk-in basis where they will be given a time slot to avoid long waits. Organisers say the appointments will be spread throughout the day to avoid the ‘surges’ that so often leave emergency staff struggling. The surgery aims to transform the fortunes of the hospital’s emergency department, which has been struggling for several years with the sheer volume of patients turning up at the door. Last month Dr Ian Stanley, the hospital’s medical director, said it was ‘unsustainable’ for NHS services in East Lancashire to remain as they are. ‘We need to redesign services to help people manage their long term conditions, rather than having them turn up at A&E,’ he added. The 24-hour GPs' surgery was opened after a major crisis in emergency care at Royal Blackburn Hospital . The hospital was so overwhelmed last month that 18 ambulances were seen queuing outside A&E . The plans have been unveiled by a newly-formed ‘federation’ of GPs, and proposes a new Acute Primary Care Centre to be built near the hospital helipad, close to the emergency department entrance. Dr Irfan Zafar, senior federation member, said: ‘We have known for a long time that a lot of patients go to A&E when they don’t need to, and this is quite a unique idea to help solve that problem. ‘It’s impossible to get an appointment at many GP surgeries, and we believe that patients then turn up at hospital because of this. ‘But with this centre the triage nurse would be able to send patients with more minor problems over to us, which is a far better option than waiting hours and blocking up A&E.’ Dr Zafar said the planned centre could offer 35,000 extra appointments each year, or about 100 per day, and bring an end to the A&E crisis. The emergency department at the Royal Blackburn is known to be the ‘busiest in the North West’ and has repeatedly failed to meet the headline four-hour the situation reached ‘crisis point’ over waiting target in recent years. Eddie Reid, 70, who had to wait hours to be seen in the emergency department, said: ‘Anything they do has to be an improvement. ‘It has become diabolical and the number of people seeking treatment at the hospital because they can’t get an appointment has exploded.’ Waiting times in A&E departments around the UK are at a record high - partly because so many patients are unable to get an appointment with their family doctor . One paramedic said the first weekend of 2015 18 ambulance crews were forced to ‘queue’ for around two hours before handing patients over to staff. He said: ‘This will be a massive help because we hope to reduce the number of A&E attendances by a big margin. It will also link in much better with GP surgeries, because we’ll have easy access to patient records. ‘There are huge delays in the system at the moment, when hospital doctors struggle to find out what medication patients are on, for example, and this puts patients at risk as well. ‘This centre will be much quicker, safer and efficient, as well as being much cheaper than seeing everyone in A&E. We think this is a groundbreaking and innovative bid and hopefully we’ll be successful. It’ll be a huge disappointment if it’s not.’ A formal bid has been submitted to the Prime Minister’s £100m Challenge Fund and has the backing of East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, the council and patient groups. Russ McLean, chairman of the Patients Voice Group for East Lancashire, said: ‘It is absolutely imperative that patients get help when they need it and for many patients, the default seems to be A&E. ‘I am convinced that patients will be seen in a more timely fashion and I am absolutely overjoyed that a not-for-profit organisation is involved in this process. I’m backing them all the way.’ Kevin McGee, chief executive at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said there were also plans for on site services such as chemists and therapists to help meet patients’ needs.","First 24-hour GPs' surgery in Britain to open in bid to ease an A&E crisis .

"A man has reportedly been blindfolded and thrown off a tower block in Syria for ‘being gay’ before being stoned to death after surviving the fall. New images have emerged appearing to show ISIS militants hurling the man off the seven-storey building in the town of Tal Abyad in Raqqa. The man, who was supposedly being punished for having a ‘homosexual affair’, apparently survived the fall, but was stoned to death by a waiting crowd at the foot of the tower block. Scroll down for video . Footage shows the man sat on a plastic chair, while blindfolded, before being thrown off the tower block . It is believed the man was hurled from the building, at least seven storeys high, as punishment for 'being gay' The man appeared to survive the fall, but was reportedly stoned to death by a waiting crowd at the bottom . The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists on the ground, claims the man was thrown from the building before being beaten to death. Photographs of the incident appear to show the man - who is thought to be in his 50s - sat on a white, plastic chair while blindfolded. He is surrounded by at least two masked militants, who are dressed in black clothing and army fatigues. The man is then thrown from the top of the tower block and one photograph shows him falling towards the ground, head first. It is believed a 'judgement' was read aloud before he was thrown, which condemned his sexuality and claimed he should be thrown from the highest point of the city as punishment. After falling to the ground, the man can then be seen sat at the foot of the building, having apparently survived the fall. One photograph shows another man, dressed in army fatigues and carrying a portable radio, seemingly checking on the man's condition. An aerial photograph then shows the waiting crowd forming a circle around the injured man  before hurling rocks and stones at him. It is understood he died from his injuries. Shocking pictures of the execution, which were posted on Live Leak, are the latest to emerge of the horrific killing of men in Syria. Last month, two men were hurled from the top of a tower block and two others were crucified in front of a baying crowd as part of a ‘brutal punishment’ for being gay. And in December last year, photos emerged on social media showing a man, accused of being homosexual, being thrown to his death from a rooftop by eight ISIS fighters. The crowd appeared to surround the man before beating him with stones until he fell unconscious . Aerial photographs show crowds gathering at the foot of the tower block, which the man was thrown from . During the same month, ISIS - also known as Islamic State or ISIL - released a document on social media, explaining the rules of its 'penal code', which is being brutally enforced across ISIS-held territory in Syria and Iraq. Entitled 'Clarification [regarding] the Hudud', the document contains a list of the punishments handed out for crimes committed in the Islamic State, in accordance with the extremist group's radical interpretation of Shariah law. All punishments are carried out after a 'trial' at an Islamic State court and, after the sentencing, the prisoner is taken into the centre of the town or city. Men and young boys of all ages are actively encouraged to gather and watch the punishments. An ISIS fighter then reads out the charges found against the victim before the punishment is carried out in public. All forms of blasphemy against Islam are punished by execution, even if the accuser chooses to repent of their sins. Likewise, committing murder, spying, apostasy or sodomy is punished by immediate death. Anyone found guilty of banditry, specifically murder and stealing, is put to death by crucifixion. According to Islamic State's reading of Shariah law, thieves have a hand cut off. It is unclear whether the victim can choose which hand is removed. Flogging is another common punishment carried out under Islamic State. According to the document, 80 lashes of the whip is given to anyone who drinks alcohol or is found guilty of committing slander. Normally the whipping is not carried out on bare skin. The punishment of stoning, where heavy rocks are thrown or piled on top of the victim, is ordered for any married man or woman who has committed adultery. A hundreds lashes and immediate exile is given to any man or woman who has sex outside of marriage.","Man blindfolded and thrown off tower block by ISIS militants for 'being gay'

"Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb, who will say that that Labour has 'screwed up' on education in Wales . Labour's record on education in Wales is a ‘scandal’ and even worse than its performance on the NHS, the Tories will claim today. In the opening salvo in a new Conservative attack on the Labour-run Welsh government, Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb will say the decline of schools has been ‘woeful’ and Labour has ‘screwed up’ education. He will unveil a series of expert findings suggesting Wales is lagging behind England. Applications from Welsh students to Oxbridge are at their lowest level in ten years, while only 4 per cent of schools are rated ‘excellent’ compared with 29 per cent in England, the Cabinet minister will say. Wales lags behind other parts of the UK and countries including Poland, Slovenia and Estonia in international education rankings compiled by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The principality performed worse than the OECD average and all other parts of the UK in all key measures, including maths, science and reading, Mr Crabb will say. By age seven, the reading ability of children in Wales is behind that of children in England and Scotland, irrespective of whether they are from families with low or high incomes. The A*-C GCSE pass rate in Wales is 70 per cent, compared to 77.8 per cent in England. While the proportion of pupils getting five good GCSEs exceeded that of England in 2000, this has now reversed. A report by former Labour Cabinet minister Alan Milburn last year found that pupils eligible for free school meals in England are 50 per cent more likely to obtain five good GCSEs than their counterparts in Wales. A report last week by Ann Keane, Wales’ chief inspector of schools, said that four in ten primary schools were ranked only as ‘adequate’. Mr Crabb, speaking today at the Sony UK headquarters in Bridgend, South Wales, will say: 'Young people who receive free school meals in Wales are 50 per cent less likely to get good GCSEs than those in England. That’s woeful. ‘When you screw up on education, the kids you fail are the ones from the most disadvantaged homes – that’s Labour’s legacy in Wales. Saying “we took our eye off the ball” doesn’t even come close to the level of responsibility Welsh Labour should be accepting. ‘The Prime Minister is aiming to tackle mediocrity in England. In Wales, Welsh Labour are trying to silence that debate and it’s the parents, pupils and teachers who they are letting down. ‘Ed Miliband said himself there was “lots to learn” from what Labour are doing in Wales, so parents have every reason to be concerned about what a future Labour Government might do in England.’ While the proportion of pupils getting five good GCSEs in Wales exceeded that of England in 2000, this has now reversed (file pic) Mr Crabb, who was raised by a single mother on a council estate and attended his local comprehensive, will suggest that in Wales there had been a ‘retreat from aspiration and excellence for kids from the most disadvantaged homes’. Wales’ education minister Huw Lewis accused Mr Crabb of a ‘base attempt to secure votes in the general election’. He said there was evidence that Wales was closing the gap with England, adding: ‘Our reforms are working, and our pupils are benefiting. 'How sad to see the Secretary of State for Wales – nominally our voice at the Cabinet table in Westminster – rubbish that achievement to please his London masters.’","Stephen Crabb will say Labour's education record in Wales is a scandal .

"Dr Carl Djerassi, the chemist who developed the birth control pill, died aged 91 on Friday . Girls today take it for granted. A rite of passage into adulthood, a hygienic routine, almost a human right. For the great majority, the modern low-dose oral contraceptive arouses little wonder, creates no health anxieties and raises no eyebrows (unless the taker is scandalously far below the age of consent). The Catholic Church still forbids it and some stay faithful to that rule, but as one Irish friend observed ironically: 'It's astonishing how often the Good Lord sends us Catholic families just two babies.' The Pill, in short, is no longer a marvel. Indeed, any young woman who watches Call The Midwife, the BBC TV drama set in the Fifties, will, at some point, ask: 'Why on earth do these women living in hovels with hordes of small children keep having more babies?' To modern eyes, pregnancy is a simple choice. Few women who take the Pill, until reports of his death last Friday at the age of 91, would have known that this can largely be credited to one man, the chemist Carl Djerassi. He arrived in the U.S. as a penniless refugee from Nazi-occupied Vienna, and was himself a virgin when he married at 19. In later years, after his invention, he reflected that — without meaning to — he had sparked a social, as well as a scientific, revolution: not to mention a financial splash as his pharmaceutical company broke records on Wall Street. This major breakthrough in human development, as so often happens, was an accident. In 1951, he was working on an arthritis drug when he discovered a way to make synthetic progestogen — mimicking the female sex hormone known as 'nature's contraceptive' and so preventing ovulation. No egg released, no pregnancy. The first pills were tough stuff, and takers had side-effects: nausea, weight gain and in some cases there was raised blood pressure (I knew one woman who nearly died). Gradually, synthetic oestrogen was added and refinements produced the low-dose combined pills of today. It was in 1960 that Britain got the Pill: it was hailed as a breakthrough, not for general sexual liberation but for domestic and family harmony. Pregnancies now could be spaced out and planned for. The Pill sparked a social, as well as a scientific, revolution and it was hailed as a breakthrough for domestic and family harmony . The old latex contraceptive barriers could be discarded with relief, though a few women mistrusted chemicals and stayed with the good old diaphragm. Initially, the Pill was used only by married women. It wasn't until 1964 that clinics and doctors agreed to prescribe it for single women and young girls. And even a few years later, when I got my first prescription, the family planning clinic was an ordeal. Although some of my 1968 college intake boasted that their mums had 'put them' on the Pill, outside that Chelsea bubble, the truth is that the Swinging Sixties didn't really get going until well into the Seventies. So in a small-town clinic you were still questioned closely about the seriousness of your relationship (it was assumed you had just one) and offered embarrassing advice by a stern nurse. I had one memorably excruciating moment: I disgraced myself in the clinic by clumsily dropping the instructional plastic model of the reproductive system and having to crawl under a table to find a lost fallopian tube. T he next day, after taking my first Pill, I went in to work at the local radio station and my first job was to interview a family planning nurse. The same nurse. We avoided one another's eyes. Djerassi came to understand that he was partly responsible for a sexual revolution: in his book This Man's Pill, he said that the invention made him more interested in how science affects society. Though, he said: 'The explosion was much faster than anyone expected.' The first pills were tough stuff, and takers had side-effects: nausea, weight gain and in some cases there was raised blood pressure . Interestingly, he was fiercely opposed by feminists including Germaine Greer. He recalled some 'unusually bitter exchanges' with her and accepted that some women thought he was to be distrusted as a patriarchal male scientist who was poisoning women with chemicals so men could have their way with them. As for the idea of a male Pill, he memorably said: 'Scientifically, we solved that a number of years ago. But . . . would you, as a woman, put your entire reproductive risk in the trust that he has remembered his Pill?' Good point. And it is the social, psychological consequences we have to reflect on now. Whenever science puts a new tool into the hands of humans — whether it's dynamite, gunpowder, the internet or the Pill — there will be both good and bad ways we use it. The huge benefits of protection from unexpected, unwanted pregnancy are obvious, not only for the young and single. We have lost the stigma of illegitimacy — and good riddance, I am just old enough to remember the era of shame — but even now a missed period can produce heart-shaking horror. A career, a life-plan, a relationship melt before your eyes: the idea of termination is instinctively abhorrent to many, but there is real misery in feeling your body being hijacked, taken over by an uncontrollable alien process you weren't braced for. Before the Pill, remember, that often happened — even to the most instinctively 'moral' girls. We all make mistakes. (Incidentally, Djerassi himself ruefully admitted of his second marriage: 'I, the person who synthesised the first Pill, married another woman because I got her pregnant.' He later had a vasectomy.) But it also became clear that men would take it for granted that women were using the Pill. By the mid-Seventies, the assumption was growing that if a woman wasn't 'fixed up', there was something weird about her. Previously, the risk of pregnancy had at least made it easier for an unwilling girl, even a girl in love, to say 'no' to full sex. It offered a breather, a chance to slow down courtship (what a forgotten word that is) and ask, as in The Shirelles song: 'Is this a lasting treasure, or just a moment's pleasure?' The pressure to 'do it' anyway grew as the Pill became a norm. he was working on an arthritis drug when he discovered a way to make synthetic progestogen, pictured is Dr Djerassi in 1940 . I remember being indignantly told it was 'selfish' not to give in to a particular lad, as if women's bodies were a natural resource it was mean to hoard. That's human nature. It is daft to overstate the 'damage to moral fabric' argument. Djerassi himself admitted that the sexual revolution — the separation of sex-for-babies and sex-for-fun — began before his discovery, and would probably have rolled on anyway, though more slowly. But there is no point denying he speeded it up. A nd that alongside the joy and ease and intimacy and happiness of liberated sex, there has been anxiety and unease and a nasty notion — now at least challenged by young feminists — that women's bodies are a commodity for men's convenience, and that sex, that most marvellous of connections, need not involve any intimacy or trust or faith on either side. The Pill has had one other effect, which no one thought about much at the time, but which now ticks like a time-bomb in the heart of every bright professional woman. The phrase 'family planning' and the rarity of surprise-babies nowadays has deceived too many of us into taking it literally. Djerassi predicted a future when his own invention would become redundant, with men and women doing away with the need for contraception altogether by being sterilised — withdrawing their frozen eggs and sperm from a 'bank' when they were ready to have a child via IVF. Already it is easy to assume that we can put off babies until our 40s, or even 50s, and trust science to give nature a hand. But it doesn't always work. The fact is, the ferocious, uncontrollable, youthful fertility which once bred panic does fade, over long years of contraception. And sometimes, it gets too late to have a baby. But these issues aside, may Carl Djerassi rest in peace. On balance, he gave a great thing to womankind and fearless happiness to millions of honest lovers. As with all inventions, it's up to us to use it wisely.","Dr Carl Djerassi, who developed birth control pill, died aged 91 on Friday .

"Unite boss Len McCluskey (pictured) has called on Blairites to 'stop stabbing Labour in the back' Union baron Len McCluskey came to Ed Miliband’s aid last night telling Blairites to ‘stop stabbing Labour in the back’. The Unite boss rounded on Peter Mandelson, Alan Milburn and John Hutton over their warnings that the party leader is heading for defeat. Mr McCluskey, whose union is Labour’s biggest donor, also urged Mr Miliband to ‘bottle the spirit’ of Greece’s far-left radicals, who have taken power in Athens. Senior Blairites have enraged Labour’s high command in recent weeks by warning that Mr Miliband’s left-wing agenda will lose him the election in May. In a speech to activists in Birmingham yesterday, Mr McCluskey said Labour should ‘ignore these blasts from the past’. He added: ‘The electorate is today poised between fear and hope. Fear is the basis of the Ukip menace – blame someone else for all the problems, usually immigrants or foreigners, and seek refuge in an imagined past. 'But it is hope that is blossoming today as we have seen in last week’s magnificent election result in Greece. ‘Labour needs to bottle some of the Syriza spirit and take that anti-austerity agenda to the people here. ‘What it doesn’t need is the Blairite re-treads – the people who sucked the life out of the last Labour government – attacking every progressive impulse, like the mansion tax and saving our NHS. 'So I say to Peter Mandelson, Alan Milburn and John Hutton – stick to counting your money, and stop stabbing Labour in the back.’ Mr McCluskey said Britain was ‘facing a fight for the future of our society’. He said Tory plans to tighten Britain’s strike laws after the election could result in widespread law-breaking by activists. ‘If a government with the backing of less than one voter in four tries to deny the rights of a movement of millions, we will treat that with the contempt it deserves,’ he said. ‘And if we are pushed outside the law, so be it. If Unite is ever to die, it will not die on its knees.’ Conservative Party vice-chairman Bob Neill said Mr McCluskey’s latest intervention was a sign of Labour’s ‘desperation’. He told Peter Mandelson (left), Alan Milburn (centre) and John Hutton (right) to 'stick to counting your money' Mr McCluskey also urged Mr Miliband (pictured) to ‘bottle the spirit’ of Greece’s far-left radicals, who have taken power in Athens . He added: ‘Ed Miliband is a weak leader whom no one listens to. He’s so desperate for friends he’s turned to Uncle Len. The unions buy the policies and pick the candidates, now they’re trying to restore order to Labour’s internal chaos.’ Unite has given Labour a £12.8 million since Mr Miliband became leader in 2010, and announced a further £1.5 million donation last week. Critics warn that the scale of the donations give the powerful union undue influence over Labour policy. But Mr McCluskey said Unite had a ‘duty to democracy’ to bankroll Labour, and suggested that further seven-figure donations are likely in the run-up to the election. ‘If we lose the election, we understand how much harder that life will be for the people we serve,’ he said. ‘That’s why I’m appealing to each and every one of you – step up to the plate. Do not stand aside from this battle, or let any doubts and reservations paralyse you. We are now facing the fight of our lives.’","McCluskey rounded on Peter Mandelson, Alan Milburn and John Hutton .

"Michael Seres, who has Crohn's, has has been in and out of hospital since age 12 . Michael Seres has had more unappetising hospital meals than he cares to remember. Since the age of 12, the 45-year-old businessman has been in and out of hospital with Crohn's disease - inflammation of the gut - and has often found the meals given to him inedible. So when he was asked if he would like to be an official food inspector for Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, where he has been treated many times, he jumped at the chance. 'I thought this was finally my opportunity to make changes happen and to help make the food better for patients,' says Michael, who lives in Radlett, Hertfordshire. Yet the experience has left him even more despairing. Michael was one of a team of six - at least half were members of the public, the rest trust staff - assessing the service on a number of criteria, including whether patients had a suitable space to eat their meal; whether the food was served at the right temperature; what it tasted like; and what the patients thought of it. The results were to be used for a Patient-Led Assessment of the Care Environment, or PLACE. These were introduced by the NHS in 2013 to help rank hospitals in England - the results are put on the NHS Choices website, so that patients can make informed decisions about where to be treated. Each trust has a team that collates the assessment for the trust - at least half of the team must be members of the general public, and the remainder can be hospital staff. But can these assessments be trusted? The food Michael witnessed being served to patients was - in his words - 'diabolical in terms of taste, service and organisation'. 'There was a ghastly mashed potato that was lumpy and inedible,' he says. 'And a vegetable soup that I can still remember very clearly. It was like dishwater - it tasted dire, with no flavour whatsoever.' After his inspection in 2013, Michael filled in his questionnaire with resoundingly critical views on what he'd seen. Yet when the PLACE assessment was published, Michael found out that the trust had been awarded 78.06 per cent for its food and how it was served. He was asked if he would like to be an official food inspector for Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust . 'I was flabbergasted,' he says. 'Judging by what I saw and experienced of the food on those inspections, they shouldn't have got more than about 5 per cent.' But it wasn't just the food that bothered Michael on his tour of the wards. Many of the meals were served by two people, working down a ward of 30 beds. 'By the time the food got to the last patient, it would be stone-cold and inedible,' he says. 'There would be other instances where the food would be put next to the patient, where they couldn't quite reach it. But because the nurse was so busy, the meal would just go to waste. We saw very high levels of food left on plates.' His concerns about the rating tally with the results of a recent survey of 850 patients at the very same trust. This was conducted by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the independent regulator of health and social care services in England. The results revealed a rather different picture from the high score given by the PLACE. The CQC patient survey rated the food just 5.2 out of ten for how 'good' it was (for choice of food, the score was higher, at 8.9 out of ten). And there is a similar disparity across the country, according to research by the Campaign for Better Hospital Food, run by the charity Sustain. It compared the results of the PLACE ratings of ten trusts with their Care Quality Commission patient surveys. According to their analysis, the average PLACE rating for food was 92.99 per cent, compared with an average of 56 per cent of patients polled by the regulator saying the food was 'good'. The campaign believes that the PLACE assessments should be handed to an independent body. 'An approval rating of 92.99 per cent does appear to be ludicrously high and does not correlate with other evidence, which suggests patients are unhappy with what they are being served in hospital,' says Alex Jackson, who heads the campaign. It wasn't just the food that bothered him - many of the meals for 30 were served by just two people . There is no doubt hospital food is a major concern. When the Daily Mail highlighted the problems recently, readers overwhelmed us with photographs of appalling meals they had been given as patients in NHS hospitals. Many also pointed out that serving such food is no way to help sick and vulnerable people to get better. Last month, a survey by YouGov of more than 1,550 NHS patients and visitors found that 43 per cent said the meals were not tasty, and 62 per cent said they should be more nutritious. To help ensure a healthy diet for patients and staff, the NHS announced that, from this April, it is bringing in new food standards in England to be enforced through legally binding contracts. Among the new requirements, trusts must offer fish twice a week and use seasonal produce. Data from PLACE inspections will be used to help monitor these standards. This worries Mr Jackson - not least because the way the PLACE results are actually compiled is 'complicated and unclear'. Part of the problem, he believes, is that the trusts are managing their own inspections. 'They only have to publish a rating out of 100 per cent, and it's not clear who was on the inspection or what the team actually reported,' he says. 'The results are not reflecting what patients are saying to us, which is that the food is bad. For Michael, the experience has been frustrating . 'Moreover, the actual quality of the food itself only represents a small part of the PLACE inspections, yet the results for the food are wrapped up in a score that includes, for example, whether napkins are provided with the patient's meal. 'This means that the government is using dodgy results to substantiate what it says it's doing to improve food.' In response to criticism that the campaign hasn't compared like-for-like data, Mr Jackson points out that 'patients will nonetheless look at these high scores and assume it means a glowing assessment of the food'. For Michael Seres, the experience has been very frustrating. 'After the inspection, along with the other team members, we sat down with staff at the hospital and gave them feedback,' he says. 'I was part of discussions about how they could change the food, and introduce a menu for those long-term patients who have to keep coming back to hospital. The staff were receptive, but I've since been back to hospital as a patient - and nothing has changed.' Wendy Robinson, the PLACE coordinator for the Oxford trust, points out that its latest results scored 89.06 per cent for the food. She says: 'We are encouraged by this result, and continue to work closely with our patients and nutritional teams to improve the food we provide for our patients.' The Department of Health says: 'Patients deserve healthy, nutritious food when they are in hospital and that's why we've brought in compulsory standards in the terms of hospital contracts to ensure they get it.' The next set of PLACE data, to be published in August, will be based on a more detailed assessment of the food. It will also include ratings such as choice at breakfast and whether fresh fruit is available.","Michael Seres said food 'taste, service and organisation was diabolical'

"Doctors are deserting the NHS to treble their salaries working as locums, MPs have warned (picture posed by model) Doctors are deserting the NHS to treble their salaries working as locums, MPs warn. A growing number are quitting their full-time hospital posts to make a career as professional agency staff. Locums typically earn £1,760 a shift – equivalent to £240,000 a year – more than three times the £75,000 average salary for consultants. A report by the Public Accounts Committee highlights that the NHS spent £2.6billion on agency staff last year, a rise of a quarter compared with 2012/13. Hospital bosses who spoke to the committee admitted that a rising number of doctors and nurses are choosing careers as ‘professional temporary locums’. Andy Hardy, chief executive of University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, said: ‘There is evidence that some doctors and nurses and other professionals are making the choice to become professional temporary staff, but that is not across the whole of the country. ‘London is a special case in terms of pay rates. If I look at my own A&E, we are fully staffed at the consultant level. But there are other specialities where we have to rely on agency staff, and some of those are permanent agency staff – that is what they do for a career.’ Matthew Hopkins, chief executive of Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, in Essex, added: ‘There are staff – not just doctors, but nurses and others – who are making that choice.’ Scroll down for video . He admitted an A&E locum consultant can typically earn £110 an hour for a 16-hour shift, or £1,760. Such a locum could work three shifts a week, take six weeks of leave and still earn three times as much as a permanent staff member. But there is concern locum doctors are not of the same high standard as full-time staff, partly because they do not know the ropes. There are also fears they may be less reliable. Exorbitant spending on locums is partly to blame for the fact that a rising number of hospitals are in deficit, the report warns. A quarter are now in the red, compared with this time last year when the figure was only 10 per cent. Locums typically earn £1,760 a shift – equivalent to £240,000 a year – more than three times the £75,000 average salary for consultants (picture posed by models) Margaret Hodge, chairman of the committee, said she was concerned by the ‘fragility’ of NHS finances. ‘Between 2012/13 and 2013/14, the amount the NHS spent on temporary medical staff increased from £2.1billion to £2.6billion,’ she said. ‘For example, Barking, Havering and Redbridge NHS Trust told us that it had a 50 per cent shortage of emergency consultants and was spending £1.5million a month on temporary staff. ‘It costs the taxpayer £400,000 to train an emergency consultant, but there are claims that some consultants are choosing to leave the NHS to work on an agency basis at a substantial cost to the NHS, with typical charges of £1,760 per day.’ She added: ‘The Department [of Health] should … require NHS bodies to use agency staff within a national framework contract.’","Doctors are deserting the NHS to treble their salaries as locums, MPs warn .

Neil Griffiths was felled by a Taser gun, pictured, after being told to come out of his house to be arrested in South Wales . ‘He was holding a piece of pizza at them and making threats, but the police were not concerned about it when they identified what it [the pizza] was.’ The use of the potentially fatal weapon brought to an end an evening of violence by Griffiths in his home village of Penrhys, South Wales. Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard how it began with him arguing with two fellow customers in a kebab shop after ordering a pizza. He left with his food, only to return with a kitchen knife. Mrs Knight yesterday told the court that Griffiths attacked one of the men, Christopher McGrath, 20, who tried to grab the knife – but it ended up against his throat. His friend, Gavin Lloyd Clement, 18, was rugby-tackled to the floor during the fight, and Griffiths knelt over him with the knife at Mr Clement’s throat. After Griffiths went home, armed police surrounded his property. ‘When he came out, he was very aggressive towards police,’ said Mrs Knight. ‘He was holding a piece of pizza at them and making threats but the police were not concerned about it when they identified what it was.’ He later told them he had been drunk and high on cocaine. He was jailed for six months after pleading guilty to two counts of assault and possessing an offensive weapon. He must also pay an £80 victim surcharge. His lawyer said his client was a ‘hard-working’ man with a young son who had learned a ‘salutary lesson’. He has three previous convictions for public disorder and possessing drugs with intent to supply. Tasers are increasingly being relied upon by British police, who now fire up to five a day. Figures published last year showed the number of confrontations involving Tasers more than doubled between 2009 and 2011, from 3,500 to 7,250. There has been a huge investment in the weapons in the decade since they were introduced, and police chiefs estimate they are now fired as often as 1,800 times a year. There are 14,700 officers trained to use the stun guns. But Police Federation chairman Steve White last week repeated calls for every frontline officer to be handed one. Experts estimate that each officer will draw his weapon once every two years and fire them once in eight years. Many police chiefs argue that the weapons offers a less lethal alternative to live ammunition and can help resolve some of the most challenging stand-offs. Critics express fears about training and monitoring and claim the police are being ‘armed by stealth’.","Neil Griffiths, 28, had been arguing with two men at a kebab shop in Wales .

"Dr Carl Djerassi, the chemist who developed the birth control pill, died aged 91 on Friday . Girls today take it for granted. A rite of passage into adulthood, a hygienic routine, almost a human right. For the great majority, the modern low-dose oral contraceptive arouses little wonder, creates no health anxieties and raises no eyebrows (unless the taker is scandalously far below the age of consent). The Catholic Church still forbids it and some stay faithful to that rule, but as one Irish friend observed ironically: 'It's astonishing how often the Good Lord sends us Catholic families just two babies.' The Pill, in short, is no longer a marvel. Few women who take the Pill, until reports of his death last Friday at the age of 91, would have known that this can largely be credited to one man, the chemist Carl Djerassi. He arrived in the U.S. as a penniless refugee from Nazi-occupied Vienna, and was himself a virgin when he married at 19. In later years, after his invention, he reflected that — without meaning to — he had sparked a social, as well as a scientific, revolution: not to mention a financial splash as his pharmaceutical company broke records on Wall Street. This major breakthrough in human development, as so often happens, was an accident. In 1951, he was working on an arthritis drug when he discovered a way to make synthetic progestogen — mimicking the female sex hormone known as 'nature's contraceptive' and so preventing ovulation. No egg released, no pregnancy. The first pills were tough stuff, and takers had side-effects: nausea, weight gain and in some cases there was raised blood pressure (I knew one woman who nearly died). Gradually, synthetic oestrogen was added and refinements produced the low-dose combined pills of today. It was in 1960 that Britain got the Pill: it was hailed as a breakthrough, not for general sexual liberation but for domestic and family harmony. Pregnancies now could be spaced out and planned for. The Pill sparked a social, as well as a scientific, revolution and it was hailed as a breakthrough for domestic and family harmony . The old latex contraceptive barriers could be discarded with relief, though a few women mistrusted chemicals and stayed with the good old diaphragm. Initially, the Pill was used only by married women. It wasn't until 1964 that clinics and doctors agreed to prescribe it for single women and young girls. And even a few years later, when I got my first prescription, the family planning clinic was an ordeal. Although some of my 1968 college intake boasted that their mums had 'put them' on the Pill, outside that Chelsea bubble, the truth is that the Swinging Sixties didn't really get going until well into the Seventies. So in a small-town clinic you were still questioned closely about the seriousness of your relationship (it was assumed you had just one) and offered embarrassing advice by a stern nurse. I had one memorably excruciating moment: I disgraced myself in the clinic by clumsily dropping the instructional plastic model of the reproductive system and having to crawl under a table to find a lost fallopian tube. T he next day, after taking my first Pill, I went in to work at the local radio station and my first job was to interview a family planning nurse. The same nurse. We avoided one another's eyes. Djerassi came to understand that he was partly responsible for a sexual revolution: in his book This Man's Pill, he said that the invention made him more interested in how science affects society. Though, he said: 'The explosion was much faster than anyone expected.' The first pills were tough stuff, and takers had side-effects: nausea, weight gain and in some cases there was raised blood pressure . Interestingly, he was fiercely opposed by feminists including Germaine Greer. He recalled some 'unusually bitter exchanges' with her and accepted that some women thought he was to be distrusted as a patriarchal male scientist who was poisoning women with chemicals so men could have their way with them. As for the idea of a male Pill, he memorably said: 'Scientifically, we solved that a number of years ago. But . . . would you, as a woman, put your entire reproductive risk in the trust that he has remembered his Pill?' Good point. And it is the social, psychological consequences we have to reflect on now. Whenever science puts a new tool into the hands of humans — whether it's dynamite, gunpowder, the internet or the Pill — there will be both good and bad ways we use it. The huge benefits of protection from unexpected, unwanted pregnancy are obvious, not only for the young and single. We have lost the stigma of illegitimacy — and good riddance, I am just old enough to remember the era of shame — but even now a missed period can produce heart-shaking horror. A career, a life-plan, a relationship melt before your eyes: the idea of termination is instinctively abhorrent to many, but there is real misery in feeling your body being hijacked, taken over by an uncontrollable alien process you weren't braced for. Before the Pill, remember, that often happened — even to the most instinctively 'moral' girls. We all make mistakes. (Incidentally, Djerassi himself ruefully admitted of his second marriage: 'I, the person who synthesised the first Pill, married another woman because I got her pregnant.' He later had a vasectomy.) But it also became clear that men would take it for granted that women were using the Pill. By the mid-Seventies, the assumption was growing that if a woman wasn't 'fixed up', there was something weird about her. Previously, the risk of pregnancy had at least made it easier for an unwilling girl, even a girl in love, to say 'no' to full sex. It offered a breather, a chance to slow down courtship: 'Is this a lasting treasure, or just a moment's pleasure?' The pressure to 'do it' anyway grew as the Pill became a norm. he was working on an arthritis drug when he discovered a way to make synthetic progestogen, pictured is Dr Djerassi in 1940 . I remember being indignantly told it was 'selfish' not to give in to a particular lad, as if women's bodies were a natural resource it was mean to hoard. That's human nature. It is daft to overstate the 'damage to moral fabric' argument. Djerassi himself admitted that the sexual revolution — the separation of sex-for-babies and sex-for-fun — began before his discovery, and would probably have rolled on anyway, though more slowly. But there is no point denying he speeded it up. A nd that alongside the joy and ease and intimacy and happiness of liberated sex, there has been anxiety and unease and a nasty notion — now at least challenged by young feminists — that women's bodies are a commodity for men's convenience, and that sex, that most marvellous of connections, need not involve any intimacy or trust or faith on either side. The Pill has had one other effect, which no one thought about much at the time, but which now ticks like a time-bomb in the heart of every bright professional woman. The phrase 'family planning' and the rarity of surprise-babies nowadays has deceived too many of us into taking it literally. Djerassi predicted a future when his own invention would become redundant, with men and women doing away with the need for contraception altogether by being sterilised — withdrawing their frozen eggs and sperm from a 'bank' when they were ready to have a child via IVF. Already it is easy to assume that we can put off babies until our 40s, or even 50s, and trust science to give nature a hand. But it doesn't always work. The fact is, the ferocious, uncontrollable, youthful fertility which once bred panic does fade, over long years of contraception. And sometimes, it gets too late to have a baby. But these issues aside, may Carl Djerassi rest in peace. On balance, he gave a great thing to womankind and fearless happiness to millions of honest lovers. As with all inventions, it's up to us to use it wisely.","Dr Carl Djerassi, who developed birth control pill, died aged 91 on Friday .

"RadioShack looks to be on the verge of closing its doors for good after 94 years. The embattled electronics chain is currently working out a bankruptcy deal that entirely liquidates the company after it went nearly three years without turning a profit, according to reports. Half of the more than 4,000 retail locations would shut down and Sprint would take over the remainder - operating them under the telecommunications company's brand, Bloomberg reports. There is still a possibility that a last-minute buyer comes forward to rescue RadioShack, which has gone 11 quarters without positive earnings. Shutdown: Fading electronics retail chain RadioShack plans to shut down in a bankruptcy deal with Sprint, according to sources with knowledge of negotiations . Sanpower, the Chinese conglomerate that helped bring Brookstone out of bankruptcy last summer, is involved and interested in acquiring RadioShack assets, one person close to the talks said. The talks have also touched on a plan for Sprint co-branding RadioShack's retail stores, two people with knowledge of the negotiations said. Barring a deal that rescues the chain, RadioShack's closing would be the final chapter in the 94-year-old company's history. The retailer began in 1921 with a customer base largely made of ham-radio operators and maritime communications officers. In 1977, the chain released one of the first mass-produced computers, the TRS-80, in its retail stores, which led competitors Apple and Commodore for a time. The New York Times reports that the company developed a strong reputation as the place to go for gear like headphones and other peripherals. Shacking up: Sprint would take over leases on 1,300 to 2,000 locations in the reported negotiations, though other deals are on the table and there are possibilities that no deal would be reached . Losing: RadioShack Corporation has posted 11 quarters of losses, and its stock value has bottomed out, falling 90 percent to 24 cents in a year's time . What remained of the company by 2000 was all but done away with by the changing retail business of smartphones and online retailers. Hedge fund Standard General extended a rescue financing package to RadioShack in October as Joe Magnacca, who took over as CEO in 2013, attempted to overhaul the chain's retail locations. If the plan proposed comes to pass, the company will sell the leases on 1,300 to 2,000 retail locations to Sprint and close the rest. The company employs around 27,000 people. The company's stock, which has already lost 90 percent of its value in a year, ended the day Monday down 13 percent at 24 cents.","The electronics retail chain would sell 1,300 to 2,000 leases and close the rest of its 4,000 locations, according to people knowledgeable about talks .

"When Paul Hills met his wife, Carole, when he was 21 and she was 46, he may well have expected to end up nursing her in her older years. But Carole, now 69, has actually become the carer for her toyboy, now 44, after his health declined. Paul, from Colchester, Essex, explains: 'I got osteoarthritis and can't do very much. I spend a lot of time in bed and can only go out on my mobility scooter. Carole actually takes care of me. Age gap love: There are 25 years between Paul and Carole who have been married for more than two decades . 'She is brilliant and I want everyone to know that. This isn't how it should be. I should be looking after her.' The pair have 'his n hers' mobility scooters which they can often be seen riding while holding hands in their home town. Their 21-year marriage has defied critics who said it wouldn't last because of their 25-year age gap. Paul was a 21-year-old musician when he met Carole, then 46, when she was finding gigs for the budding singer and guitarist in Portsmouth. 'His n' hers': The pair hold hands as they ride their mobility scooters - which Paul, 44, needs as he suffers from osteoarthritis. Carole, 69, has become his carer . Despite his initial reservations, he succumbed to Carole's advances, jokingly calling her a nymphomaniac after their first night together, as they appear on Channel 5's Age Gap Love documentary. After they started dating, it wasn't long before Carole hinted at marriage but Paul wanted to wait for two years to ensure they were making the right decision. They have now been married for more than two decades but Paul admits times have changed since they first met. Paul was 21 and Carole was 46 when they first met and they married two years later in 1994 . He said: 'We were out partying and dancing all the time. It was all sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. In the end, we got married in 1994.' He added that they had to overcome some 'negativity' because of their age difference. Many of his friends and family were worried he would end up looking after Carole in her old age, in fact the reverse has happened. 'I should be looking after her,' Paul admits. Everyone thought he would end up caring for Carole because of their age gap but the reverse has happened . Paul said: 'My family were very understanding, but my mum was a little bit worried about how it would work out. But we have just had great fun. 'We didn't have any children and while we looked at adopting, it wasn't meant to be. But I have Carole, and she is amazing.'

The satellite – designed and built domestically – is capable of sustaining its orbit for 18 months and is named Fajr, which translates as dawn. The launch comes amid negotiations with world powers over Iran’s contested nuclear programme. The satellite – designed and built domestically – is capable of sustaining its orbit for 18 months and is named Fajr, which translates as dawn . International observers worry that its space programme is merely a precursor to designing rockets that could carry nuclear weapons. But Tehran insists that its nuclear and space programmes are for peaceful purposes only. President Hassan Rouhani announced the satellite's launch, claiming he had ordered the mission personally. 'Our scientists have entered a new phase for conquering space. We will continue on this path,' Rouhani said in a short statement on state television. He added the 52kg machine was designed to take photographs from space. It is believed to have taken eight minutes to reach orbit and has been in contact with ground-based controllers, Al Jazeera reports. Fajr is the first observations satellite launched by Iran since 2012.

"Researchers have  worked a way to predict how everything from a face to a raisin will wrinkle. They say their algorithm can accurately predict wrinkles on a curved surface for the first time. They say it helps explain how our fingerprints, and wrinkles on our face, form over time. A team of MIT mathematicians and engineers has developed a mathematical theory, confirmed through experiments, that predicts how wrinkles on curved surfaces take shape - even on skin. As a grape slowly dries and shrivels, its surface creases, ultimately taking on the wrinkled form of a raisin. Similar patterns can be found on the surfaces of other dried materials, as well as in human fingerprints. 'If you look at skin, there's a harder layer of tissue, and underneath is a softer layer, and you see these wrinkling patterns that make fingerprints,' says Jörn Dunkel, an assistant professor of mathematics at MIT. 'Could you, in principle, predict these patterns? It's a complicated system, but there seems to be something generic going on, because you see very similar patterns over a huge range of scales.' While these patterns have long been observed in nature, and more recently in experiments, scientists have not been able to come up with a way to predict how such patterns arise in curved systems, such as microlenses. Theteam of MIT mathematicians and engineers has developed a mathematical theory, confirmed through experiments, that predicts how wrinkles on curved surfaces take shape. From their calculations, they determined that one main parameter — curvature — rules the type of pattern that forms: The more curved a surface is, the more its surface patterns resemble a crystal-like lattice. The researchers say the theory, reported this week in the journal Nature Materials, may help to generally explain how fingerprints and wrinkles form. In past experiments, Reis manufactured ping pong-sized balls of polymer in order to investigate how their surface patterns may affect a sphere's drag, or resistance to air. The group sought to develop a general theory to describe how wrinkles on curved objects form — a goal that was initially inspired by observations made by Dunkel's collaborator, Pedro Reis, the Gilbert W. Winslow Career Development Associate Professor in Civil Engineering. In past experiments, Reis manufactured ping pong-sized balls of polymer in order to investigate how their surface patterns may affect a sphere's drag, or resistance to air. Reis observed a characteristic transition of surface patterns as air was slowly sucked out: As the sphere's surface became compressed, it began to dimple, forming a pattern of regular hexagons before giving way to a more convoluted, labyrinthine configuration, similar to fingerprints. 'Existing theories could not explain why we were seeing these completely different patterns,' Reis says. In computer simulations, the researchers confirmed that their equation was indeed able to reproduce correctly the surface patterns observed in experiments. They were therefore also able to identify the main parameters that govern surface patterning. As it turns out, curvature is one major determinant of whether a wrinkling surface becomes covered in hexagons or a more labyrinthine pattern: The more curved an object, the more regular its wrinkled surface. The thickness of an object's shell also plays a role: If the outer layer is very thin compared to its curvature, an object's surface will likely be convoluted, similar to a fingerprint. If the shell is a bit thicker, the surface will form a more hexagonal pattern.","MIT team say algorithm can accurately predict wrinkles on a curved surface .

"You've no doubt seen countless images of the universe, complete with rainbow-coloured galaxies and nebulae. But do these breathtaking cosmic entities really exist as they are presented? The simple answer is 'no'. Images of objects deep in space are more often than not subjected to a great deal of processing to transform what looks like a featureless night sky to the naked eye into a explosion of hues. Amateur astronomer Richard Bloch revealed the techniques used in a YouTube video, using an image of the Rosette Nebula. Scroll down for video . There's a nebula in this image - but you'd be forgiven for not being able to see it. An amateur astronomer has explained in a video how Nasa enhances images of space to reveal features and details that would otherwise be hidden to the human eye. For example, some colours can highlight certain gases and elements . The image above may just look like a generic snapshot of the night sky, but hidden in the data is in fact an enormous nebula spanning most of the picture, as revealed in the video. Indeed, if you were able to travel to the nebula, you may be disappointed. None of the gases would be visible to the naked human eye. The features made of dust and gas, as shown in the processed images, are actually there – but the human eye is simply not sensitive to the wavelengths of light they emit. Only through manipulating the image can an invisible nebula's features be revealed - a 'trick' Nasa employs to enhance its images of the cosmos. Mr Bloch explained the methods that take place to reveal hidden cosmic features, with colours highlighting some of the details and features that would otherwise be invisible to us. That's because our eyes are limited in the wavelengths they can see; we are only sensitive to visible light on the electromagnetic spectrum. Telescopes and cameras are more advanced, though, and they can be used to reveal light in other wavelengths, from X-rays to infrared. In his video, Mr Bloch collected data from the Rosetta Nebula on 1 December 2014 from the Torrance Barrens Dark Sky Preserve in Ontario, Canada. He took the image using a Canon T3i camera attached to a telescope, and creating the image using PixInsight 1.8. The video begins with a very ordinary-looking shot of the night sky, complete with thousands of stars, and no discernible nebula in the image. But a method called ‘stretching’ then reveals the nebula hidden in the darkest parts of the image. - To depict how an object might look to us if our eyes were as powerful as Hubble. - To visualise features of an object that would ordinarily be invisible to the human eye. - To bring out an object's subtle details. On Reddit, Mr Bloch explained what this process entails. He said if each pixel was said to have a value from 0 to 255, the entire nebula would be in the region 0 to 50 - not visible to the human eye. ‘Stretching is taking that 0 to 50 and mapping it across 0 to 255 so that the bright parts of the nebula are the bright parts of the image,’ he said. After stretching the image, he performs some 'noise reduction' to rid the image of superfluous data and then adds some colour to the image, with different colours corresponding to different gases and elements. He then reduces the sizes of some of the stars so they don’t block the view of the nebula, before improving the contrast and creating the final image. This image shows the intermediate spiral galaxy NGC 3982 before (left) and after (right) colour is added to the image to highlight some of its key features . One of Nasa's most famous images is the Eagle Nebula. On the left is one of three black and white images that were combined to create the final colour version on the right . The Hubble Space Telescope, pictured, uses electronic detectors rather than film like a regular camera to take images of the universe, so data on the images is added after they have been 'taken' The technique he described is very similar to how Nasa makes its own amazing images. As explained by Nasa, Hubble records light from the universe with electronic detectors, rather than a film like a regular camera. The colour is then added at a later date. ‘The colours in Hubble images, which are assigned for various reasons, aren't always what we'd see if we were able to visit the imaged objects in a spacecraft,’ Nasa said on their Hubble website. ‘We often use colour as a tool, whether it is to enhance an object's detail or to visualise what ordinarily could never be seen by the human eye.’","An amateur astronomer took a picture of a nebula from Canada .

"MP George Galloway, who is set to appear on this week's Question Time, which will come from Finchley, north London, home to a large Jewish community . Britain's Jewish community has criticised the BBC’s decision to invite George Galloway on to this week’s Question Time. The programme will come from Finchley, North London, which has the largest Jewish community of any parliamentary constituency. Last year MP Mr Galloway was interviewed by police on suspicion of inciting religious hatred after he declared his Bradford constituency was an ‘Israel-free’ zone. He previously refused to debate with a student at Oxford University because he was Israeli. Mike Freer, the Conservative MP for Finchley and Golders Green, said the invitation was ‘deliberately provocative’. He added: ‘The BBC can’t have done it by accident. ‘Given what’s going on in the world it is a slap in the face for the local community. It lacks sensitivity.’ Mr Freer and the Jewish Leadership Council, which brings together major Jewish organisations, have written to the BBC challenging the decision, and asking whether it is a ‘responsible move’. The Board of Deputies of British Jews also attacked the decision to invite Mr Galloway – but said they were not calling on the BBC to retract the invitation. Gillian Merron, chief executive of the Board, said: ‘The BBC certainly has questions to answer for this inflammatory and cynical decision. ‘However, while some may feel it is expedient to shy away from difficult debates with hostile individuals, we look forward to the people of Finchley and Golders Green having the opportunity to call George Galloway to account for his scandalous record of provocation and division.’ The Community Security Trust, a charity which monitors anti-Semitism and organises security for schools and synagogues said: ‘We’re concerned that having it in Finchley at this time has the potential to inflame community tensions in the areas between communities who normally get on very well. We would not want this to spoil that. ‘If the BBC didn’t understand the strength of feeling in the community about George Galloway, I think they understand it now.’ Mr Galloway was thrown out of the Labour party in 2003 but made a comeback with the Respect party in 2005 in East London. He returned to Westminster in March 2012 after winning the seat of Bradford West in a by-election. Mr Galloway giving a speech to Respect party acitivists in Bradford last year, where he declared Bradford as an 'Israel-free zone' He was interviewed by West Yorkshire Police last August after saying at an event, which was filmed: ‘We have declared Bradford an Israel-free zone. We don’t want any Israeli goods; we don’t want any Israeli services; we don’t want any Israeli academics coming to the university or the college. ‘We don’t even want any Israeli tourists to come to Bradford even if any of them had thought of doing so. We reject this illegal, barbarous, savage state that calls itself Israel - and you have to do the same.’ In February 2013, he shocked an audience at Christ Church college, Oxford by storming out on hearing his opponent was Israeli. To cries of ‘racism’, he picked up his coat and stormed out. He later wrote on his Facebook page: ‘I refused this evening…to debate with a supporter of the apartheid state of Israel. The reason is simple: no recognition, no normalisation. Just boycott, divestment and sanctions until the apartheid state is defeated.’ Mr Galloway has met Saddam Hussein and worked for the Iranian propaganda channel Press TV. In 2009, Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip and has been designated a terrorist organisation by the US and European Union, gave Mr Galloway a Palestinian passport. He gave them £25,000. This week's edition of Question Time, fronted by David Dimbleby, pictured, comes from North Finchley, home to a large Jewish community . In November 2012, during an anti-Israeli demonstration in his Bradford constituency, he told those present: ‘We do not hate Jews. We hate Zionism, we hate Israel, we hate murder and injustice.’ A BBC spokesperson said: ‘Question Time invites panellists who reflect a significant range of opinions on a number of different topics. 'Whilst Mr Galloway’s views are entirely his own, as an MP he has a right to appear on the programme and has done so previously. Subjects for discussion are chosen by our audience ahead of each show and this edition of Question Time will be no different.’ Other guests on the programme this Thursday include columnist Janet Street-Porter and shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt.

"January might be coming to an end but the nation's health kick is showing no signs of slowing down. New research shows that Brits are still on a mission to lose weight and lead healthier lifestyles but they're embracing a new method - and it's good news for those who shudder at the thought of chugging a green juice. New research by ao.com reveals that souping has become the go-to food trend so popular that sales of soup-maker blenders are overtaking the once-beloved juicer. Scroll down for videos . Juicing was big business in 2014 thanks to fans Miranda Kerr, left, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, right, but according to new research, 2015 is all about souping . Souping, which, according to nutritionists, reduces the high amount of saturated fats from dairy and meat products and offers nutrients, fibre and essential vitamins without all the sugar and salt of pre-packed soups, came from the US. Clean-living preacher Gwyneth Paltrow included a different soup recipe in every day of her annual Goop detox. Recipes included a kabocha squash soup that she described as a 'warming winter soup' with 'a good kick of ginger, which helps stimulate digestion'. She also includes red lentil soup, writing: 'This vegan soup is clean and bright from the cilantro and lime, but robust enough to keep you full between meals'. Vegetable-based soups are designed to give  all the nutrition-packed benefits of a juice cleanse detox . The healthy mother and author also mentions blending a lot of leftover ingredients into soups for the health benefits. Jennifer Aniston is also a big souping fan and favours a celery variety, made with onion, cauliflower and vegetable broth. Companies like Soup Cleanse and Soupure offer cleanses they describe as a 'day-long regimen of vegetable-based soups, designed to give you all of the nutrition-packed benefits of a juice cleanse detox while sidestepping any glycaemic spike from the fruit in most juices - and with even fewer calories.' Soups you sip on throughout the cleanse include kale, cauliflower and ginger, spinach and broccoli, beetroot and orange, and a cucumber, melon and mint dessert-style soup. Speaking about the trend, Jo Travers BSc RD, an expert in nutrition and dietetics, said: 'Pre-packed soups are often loaded with salt or preservatives, or heated to very high temperatures, which can destroy some of the nutritional content, turning a healthy food into something much less so. 'When you make soup yourself, you are in control of what goes in and what stays out.' Madeleine Shaw, a nutritionist who works with Millie Mackintosh, said: 'Soup is so nice this time of year, warming, nourishing and tasty.' Clean living Gwyneth Paltrow included a roasted kabocha squash soup recipe in her annual Goop detox . One of her favourite soup recipes is a beetroot and pumpkin dish packed with pumpkin, beetroots, cinnamon, coconut oil, onion, chicken stock and nutmeg. Speaking about the dish, she said: 'This  is easy to make and has the most amazing bright purple colour to it. 'It is abundant in the antioxidant beta-carotene thanks to the delicious pumpkin and gives us a healthy dose of folic acid from the beetroot. The cinnamon gives this dish that extra taste and also iron, calcium and manganese. It helps stabilize blood sugar levels too, which is great for weight loss. 'Just smelling cinnamon alone is said to boost cognitive function and memory, so give the soup a good whiff before you dig in.' Neal's Yard Remedies, meanwhile, have unveiled a healing foods cookbook and includes soups packed with superfoods such as wheatgrass for an extra nutritional hit. Susan Curtis, natural health director at Neal’s Yard Remedies, said: 'Soup is packed with nutrients. Even the simplest ingredients can be quickly transformed into easy to digest soups that stimulate, protect, detox and strengthen. 'Vegetable based soups are an excellent source of soluble fibre, while soups with grains like barley and quinoa provide insoluble fibre, which are very helpful for healthy digestion. 'Adding beans which are full of fibre and potassium, can help lower blood pressure whilst adding good slow releasing carbohydrates like brown rice, oats and root vegetables will keep you fuller for longer.' Here are three healing soup recipes from the brand's cookbook, Neal's Yard Remedies Healing Foods, published by DK, £16.99, www.dk.com, nealsyardremedies.com . Raw tomato soup . Raw tomato soup is created to be cleansing . Comprising more than 90 per cent water and rich in antioxidants, tomatoes cleanse the liver, purify the blood, and are cooling and hydrating. They are useful in treating high blood pressure, accompanied by red eyes and headaches. The freshly juiced basil in this recipe enhances digestion, helps clear respiratory congestion and phlegm, and can lift the mood. Serves 4 . 8 large ripe tomatoes . 2 tbsp basil . 8 celery sticks . 1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped . 2 small garlic cloves, roughly chopped . 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil salt and freshly ground black pepper . 1 Using a sharp knife, cut a light cross through the skin at the top of each tomato, then place the tomatoes in a bowl and cover with hot water. Let the water cool a little, then drain. Peel the skins off the tomatoes, cut into quarters, remove the seeds, dice the flesh, and place it in a blender or food processor. 2 Remove the basil leaves from their stalks and reserve the leaves as a garnish. Juice the basil stalks with the celery sticks in a juicer and add the juice to the blender, along with the chilli and garlic. 3 Blitz the ingredients until smooth. Add the olive oil, season to taste, and blitz once more. Pour the soup into 4 serving bowls. Garnish with the basil leaves, tearing them roughly with your fingers if they are large, or leaving them whole if they are small, and serve. Wild garlic soup . Wild garlic soup will boost the immune system . Sweet potato, wheatgrass, and wild garlic, all have anti-inflammatory and cleansing properties, so this is the perfect soup if you are feeling the cold or your immune system is sluggish after any winter bugs or illnesses. Wild garlic is only available in the spring, so if you want to make this soup at other times of the year, substitute it with a mixture of wild rocket and spinach. Serves 4 . 1 tbsp sunflower oil . 4 medium shallots, chopped . 1 medium sweet potato (about 400g/14oz), peeled and chopped into small cubes . 700ml (11⁄4 pints) vegetable stock . 1 tbsp wheatgrass juice or 1 tsp wheatgrass powder (optional) 4 tbsp crème fraîche or natural yogurt, to serve (optional) 200g (7oz) young wild garlic leaves salt and freshly ground black pepper . 1 Heat the sunflower oil in a medium saucepan over a low heat, add the shallots and a little water, and allow the shallots to soften. Add the sweet potato and sauté for 5 minutes. Pour in the hot vegetable stock, bring to the boil, and simmer for about 15 minutes until the sweet potato softens. 2 Meanwhile, if using the wheatgrass juice or powder, mix it with the crème fraîche or yogurt in a small bowl. 3 Remove the pan from the heat, pour the mixture into a blender or food processor and blitz until smooth. Add the wild garlic leaves and blitz again until smooth. Season to taste. Pour the soup into 4 individual serving bowls, swirl a tablespoon of crème fraîche or yogurt into each portion, and serve. Butternut squash soup . Butternut squash soup could help calm allergies . Squash has fibre, which benefits the stomach and digestive system. It’s a good choice if you suffer from allergies or food sensitivities, as it’s non-allergenic. Squash is also rich in beta-carotene to strengthen lungs, pancreas, and spleen. Combined with garlic, onions, and spices, this makes an immune-boosting meal. Both lemongrass and coconut milk add a mental and emotional uplift. Serves 6 . 2 tbsp olive oil . 3 small onions, finely chopped . 1kg (2 1⁄4lb) butternut squash, deseeded and cut into small chunks . 1.5 litres (2 3⁄4 pints) vegetable stock . 4 kaffir lime leaves . 1 stalk lemongrass, bruised . 2 garlic cloves . 200ml (7fl oz) coconut milk zest and juice of 1 lime . Salt and freshly ground black pepper and a few sprigs of coriander leaves, to garnish . 1 lime, cut into 6 wedges with a cut across the centre of each wedge, to serve . 1 Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan, add the onions, and sauté over a low heat for 2–3 minutes until they are translucent. 2 Add the squash and cook over a medium heat, stirring occasionally until the vegetables are softened at the edges. 3 Add the stock, kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass, and garlic. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer for about 30 minutes or until the squash is cooked through, but still retains some shape. 4 Remove the kaffir lime leaves and lemongrass and discard. Add the coconut milk and bring back to the boil. Remove from the heat, add the lime zest, and season with salt and black pepper to taste. 5 Pour the soup into a food processor or blender, and blitz to a smooth consistency. Add some fresh lime juice to taste, pour into bowls, and garnish with the fresh coriander. 6 Just before serving, fix a lime wedge to the rim of every bowl for each person to add a little extra lime juice, if they like. TIP: Keep the skin on the butternut squash to take advantage of the extra fibre, especially if it is a young one. Once cooked and blended the texture will become smooth.","Soup blenders and steam blender sales have overtaken the juicer .

"A husband and wife who plunged down the side of snow covered peak were at the centre of a  mountain rescue operation. The couple, named as Brian and Michelle Carlson, were tethered together when they cartwheeled and bounced down the steep precipice. They were saved by a mountain rescue team training on the south side of Mount Hood in Oregon, USA, who witnessed the couple crash down the sheer ridge. It was not known what caused the fall.

The stricken husband and wife were lucky to survive, but were left stranded after Mrs Carlson, 43, broke both ankles and her husband, 39, suffered a broken leg. A third climber, Karthnik Jambunathan, 29, suffered minor injuries after crashing over the snow as he aided the rescue effort. On the move: During the two hour operation the team armed with a stretcher twice descended the peak . Flying high: The National Guard scrambled a helicopter to transport the injured climbers to hospital in Portland . 'They sort of rolled, somersaulted, cartwheeled, that type thing,' climber Pearce Beissinger, who saw the fall, told KGW. 'When you're falling at a 50-degree slope angle, it is a pretty rapid fall and as you watch them kind of bounce down the mountain, you know there are going to be some pretty serious injuries.' Erik Broms from the Portland Mountain Rescue said: 'I was on my way down when somebody yelled falling. 'I literally had to step out of the way before getting hit by the female and the male.' Luckily for the husband and wife Portland Mountain Rescue team were training close to the spot where the fall happened and leapt into action. During the two hour operation the team armed with a stretcher twice descended the peak. Rescuer Erik Broms, pictured,  from the Portland Mountain Rescue had to step out of the way to avoid the falling husband and wife .

"Putting down the box she had been carrying, Marion Brown leaned against a wall and took a deep breath. She'd walked only 500 yards from the car to her daughter Jill's beauty salon, but the effort had left her gasping as if she'd ran up a hill. She thought it was her asthma playing up. 'I'd been diagnosed with it years before and, although I didn't need to use my inhaler often, it occasionally flared up when I was walking uphill or for long distances, or carrying something heavy,' says Marion, 62, a retired district nurse who lives with her husband Kevin, 61, a retired engineering company director, in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear. Scroll down for video . Marion Brown, 62, from Gateshead, had her asthma checked out - and it turned out she had cencer . 'When she saw how out of breath I was, Jill begged me to get it checked out, but I brushed off her concerns. I wasn't feeling at all unwell and had no other symptoms. But days later, when I was still getting breathless, I decided to follow her advice. I thought I'd get a new inhaler and that would be that.' Marion saw a young GP, instead of her usual doctor, who noted that she hadn't had her asthma investigated properly for some time, and sent her for a chest X-ray. It was a decision that probably saved Marion's life. Just over a week later, she had an X-ray at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead - this revealed a small, opaque shadow on her right lung. 'The doctors thought it was scarring from an old infection, so they decided to leave it for four weeks to see if it would repair itself,' says Marion. But when she returned for the follow-up X-ray in February 2010, the shadow was still there. 'The consultant turned to me and said I'd have to see someone else. My heart sank - I had enough knowledge from my time as a district nurse to know the outlook wasn't good.' Within a week, Marion was back in hospital with Kevin to be told it might be cancer. 'But I didn't believe it could be. I felt too well for that,' she says. Indeed, her scans and a biopsy came back clear. 'Thankfully, the consultant knew that it couldn't be nothing and he didn't want to send me away without investigating further,' she says. The retired district nurse hadn't smoked for years . A second biopsy found some suspicious cells on Marion's lung, and she was told she'd need surgery to remove them. Three weeks later, she had a lobectomy to remove the top segment of her right lung. 'As I walked into the consultant's office for the results, he took one look at me and asked why there was no one with me,' says Marion. 'I'd done such a good job of convincing myself it wouldn't be cancer that I'd decided it would be OK to go alone.' But then the consultant told Marion he'd removed a small - 3.7 cm - cancer 'which would probably buy me another five years'. 'I was devastated. I just couldn't believe it. I'd always thought of lung cancer as a heavy-smoking, old-man's disease. 'Years before, I'd been a social smoker, only smoking the odd cigarette when out with friends. In times of stress, I'd smoke a bit more, but I'd never have more than ten in any one day. Some days, I wouldn't have any at all. But when I was diagnosed with cancer, I hadn't actually smoked for ten years, because it had started to bring on my asthma. I just didn't think lung cancer would ever affect me.' Marion is one of a growing number of women being diagnosed with the disease - in the UK, the number affected has risen by 13 per cent over the past decade, according to Cancer Research UK. This year, death rates from lung cancer among European women are set to overtake those for breast cancer, according to a study of cancer rates in 28 EU countries published last week. Researchers from the University of Milan, who carried out the study, say the trend is largely due to women in the UK and their long history of smoking. But cancer experts are quick to point out that occasional smokers and even non-smokers are also at risk. Ian Hunt, a consultant thoracic surgeon at St George's Hospital in Tooting, says: 'Decades ago, we saw a rise in more women smoking. While in recent years that number has decreased, particularly among middle-aged women, smoking among young women is still quite prevalent.' Another change is in the type of cigarettes people smoke. When Marion did smoke, she tended to choose extra-mild, low-tar varieties. Mr Hunt says: 'Many people, especially women, have moved on to low-tar cigarettes in the mistaken belief they're better for them - but there is some evidence to suggest that people inhale these more deeply than they would a stronger cigarette in order to get the same effects. This has led to a change in the types of cancer we now see.' The two types of lung cancer most often seen in the UK are squamous cell carcinoma (usually found in the centre of the lung) and adenocarcinoma (the type diagnosed in Marion, and often found in the outer areas of the lungs). Marion is one of a growing number of women being diagnosed with the disease . In recent years, surgeons like Mr Hunt have seen a rise in adenocarcinoma, which is the most common lung cancer in women - possibly as they inhale low-tar cigarettes more deeply - and in non-smokers, though experts are unclear why. 'People think of lung cancer as a smoker's disease and there's this idea that if you stop smoking, your risk of lung cancer somehow decreases back to the level of someone who never smoked at all. 'In fact, that doesn't happen. It's simply not true to assume that risk is eliminated once you stop smoking.' Nor is it simply that heavy smokers are most at risk. 'The truth is, we just don't know why some people smoke heavily for years and never get lung cancer, while some occasional smokers do.' Unfortunately, as Loic Lang-Lazdunski, professor of thoracic surgery at King's College London, says, too often lung cancer is detected only once it's spread. While this is true for both men and women, it doesn't help women's diagnosis that the traditional image of a lung cancer patient is the older man. 'The fact is, we are seeing more women in their 40s or 50s who've smoked 20 cigarettes a day since the ages of 13 and 15,' says Professor Lang-Lazdunski. 'Their tumours are generally peripheral adenocarcinomas on the outer edges of the lungs, small and aggressive, which spread rapidly.' These are treatable with surgery, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, if caught early enough. But too often, women ignore symptoms like a bad cough or breathlessness, or attribute them to something else, only seeing a doctor once the cancer has spread. The official advice is to see a GP if you've had a persistent cough for three weeks, feel breathless, or start to cough up blood. The good news is that advances in medicine are making certain types of lung cancer more treatable. After surgery, Marion underwent chemotherapy and, in April, she will have been in remission for five years . Professor Lang-Lazdunski says: 'We know that in the European population, about 15 per cent of female lung cancer patients who have never smoked have a particular gene mutation that makes them more susceptible to developing lung cancer. The EGFR, or epidermal growth factor receptor, mutation is virtually exclusively found in adenocarcinomas.' Patients with this mutation show an impressive response to newly developed drugs known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which bind to the surface of cancer cells to stop them growing and dividing, says Professor Lang-Lazdunski. He adds: 'Large studies have found survival and quality of life to be better in patients carrying those mutations when using the new drugs versus intravenous chemotherapy, no matter what stage their cancer is at, and patients with advanced-stage cancer are now routinely tested for the mutation.' After surgery, Marion underwent chemotherapy and, in April, she will have been in remission for five years. She now tries to live her life to the full and is the picture of health. 'When I tell people that I had lung cancer, they don't believe me,' she says. 'Like me, they thought lung cancer only affected older men. 'I want everyone to be aware that anyone is susceptible and to know the symptoms - even if they have just one, like I did. 'Thanks to my daughter and that young GP, my cancer was detected early enough to give me a fighting chance. Without that, I may not have lived to feel as lucky as I do.'

"Leader of the Commons William Hague unveiled plans aimed at delivering 'home rule' for England . Scottish nationalists will still be able to interfere in laws which don't apply north of the border - despite moves to introduce English votes for English laws, Tory backbenchers said today. Under proposals put forward by William Hague, policies affecting England alone would be scrutinised by a panel made up only of MPs representing English seats. A 'grand committee' of all English MPs would then have to approve the legislation. But the proposals still allow Scottish MPs to block English-only laws at a final UK-wide vote. Former Cabinet minister John Redwood said Mr Hague's plans needed to be 'strengthened'. He said: 'It invites the SNP to come in and interfere with English laws and that might prove to be counter-productive. We will have to wait and see.' Mr Redwood added: 'If you had a lot of Nationalist MPs, for example, who wanted something for Scotland then presumably they would all gang up and try to block an English proposal until we cave in. 'Far from keeping the Union together, as the minority of MPs think who want this proposal, it actually does more damage because it gives a battering ram against the Union to Nationalist MPs. It is a very, very dangerous thing to do.' A large section of Tory backbenchers are angry at what they say is a watering down of David Cameron's promise to introduce English-votes-for-English-laws. Barring Scottish MPs from voting on key affairs would permanently cripple Labour's influence at Westminster, given the party's reliance on the support of its 41 MPs north of the border. At the last election, the Conservatives won 296 of 533 MPs in England and would have had an overall majority of 59. The last Labour government passed several key pieces of legislation – including that introducing foundation hospitals and tuition fees – thanks to the votes of Scottish MPs whose constituents were unaffected, given Holyrood's control of health and education policy. Senior Conservatives insist Scottish MPs should be barred from determining laws that only affect England, given Scotland's new rights to determine its own affairs. Former Cabinet minister John Redwood said Mr Hague's plans needed to be 'strengthened' to win support from Tory MPs . Mr Hague today outlined proposals for an English veto, which would apply to income tax, air passenger duty and other matters affecting only England. The Conservatives want a new committee stage of legislation relating only to England, or only to England and Wales, would be considered only by MPs from those parts of the United Kingdom. Crucially, those MPs would then have a veto over such legislation to prevent the wishes of the English or English and Welsh being overridden by Scottish MPs. However, the legislation would still have to then clear a final hurdle of all MPs, as it does now, meaning Scottish MPs could attempt to throw out an entire Bill. Yesterday, Gordon Brown paved the way for a more generous benefits system in Scotland in a desperate bid to outflank the SNP on the left . Mr Hague said: 'The Prime Minister and I have decided that the option we will put forward to Parliament and the country will be one that gives an effective veto to English MPs over matters only affecting England, or England and Wales, while maintaining the integrity of the United Kingdom Parliament. Both of these objectives are crucial, and both can be fulfilled by our chosen way forward. 'We Conservatives believe that this principle of English consent, the English veto should be extended to taxation when the equivalent decisions have been devolved to Scotland – and under a Conservative Government it will be. 'This is a fundamental matter of fairness. How could it possibly be right for the Scottish Parliament for example, to vote for a reduction in Air Passenger Duty in Scotland and then for Scottish MPs to come to Westminster and be able to impose an increase in Air Passenger Duty in England? 'You only have to think about this for a moment to see how fundamentally important this is and how such issues have to be addressed. Under our proposal this would not be possible without the agreement of English MPs.' Mr Hague  rejected the argument that reform will weaken the UK, insisting: 'I say that failure to act would be the true weakening of the United Kingdom.' Yesterday, Gordon Brown paved the way for a more generous benefits system in Scotland in a desperate bid to outflank the SNP on the left. With panic sweeping through Scottish Labour amid fears of a general election wipe-out at the hands of Scottish Nationalists, the former Prime Minister yesterday unveiled plans to hand yet more powers to Holyrood. In his first foray into the election campaign, Mr Brown said Labour wanted the Scottish Parliament to be able to make top-up payments to all benefit claimants if it wins the general election, raising the possibility of a higher state pension and more generous dole payments north of the border. An academic report by Professor Richard Rose of the Centre for the Study of Public Policy at Strathclyde University yesterday predicted that David Cameron will remain in power because Labour will lose so many seats to the SNP. The Nationalist threat is 'categorical', according to the findings, and could see the party win 45 of Scotland's 59 seats, leaving Labour with a rump of just ten Scots MPs.","William Hague unveils proposals to limit the influence of Scottish MPs .

"It has spent years cultivating its image as the acceptable face of capitalism but now John Lewis is in danger of being seen as the same as all the rest after ditching its final salary pension scheme.

But in a cost cutting move the firm is replacing the gold plated perk with a hybrid scheme based in part on staff contributions.

John Lewis employs more than 80,000 and last year said it had agreed a 10-year plan to reduce its deficit which stood at £840m. The new hybrid scheme is a mix between defined benefit and defined contribution. The firm will contribute 3per cent of basic pay for staff in the bit of the scheme linked to salary, matching staff contributions up to 4.5per cent. It will also pay 120th of their finally salary for every year worked – as part of the secondary scheme which is a reduced amount . The waiting period before joining the defined benefit part of the scheme is being increased from three years to five years from April 2015 . The changes in the proposal will take effect for new partners from April 2015 and for existing Partners from April 2016.

"A Navy SEAL faces 12 years in prison for tricking fellow servicemen out of millions of dollars to fund his luxurious lifestyle. Jason Mullaney persuaded 11 of his SEAL colleagues and a close friend to invest $1.2 million into Trident Global Financial Holdings - a front for his own account which he used to buy a Mercedez Benz, a mansion, and run rings in Las Vegas gambling halls. And when one asked him about the debt, Mullaney allegedly beat him with a gun, tied him up, and cut off one of his fingers, a court in San Diego heard. Despite pleading guilty to four counts of fraud, the 43-year-old, part of SEAL Team Five until 2003, has since tried to revoke his plea and said he feels no remorse. Scheme: Jason Mullaney has pleaded guilty to tricking 11 of his comrades out of $1.2 million for his own use . His plea change was denied and he will be sentenced on March 17. The court heard how Mullaney invoked a sense of brotherhood by naming his fake business 'Trident', after the Navy SEAL insignia, in January 2008. Mullaney told his 'brothers' he planned to give loans to small businesses in return for high interest rates, Fox News reported. He promised to return their payments, plus 24 per cent of the profit within 12 months. However, the money never resurfaced - driving the duped investors into severe debt, while he gambled up to $70,000 a night in Las Vegas, the court heard. Finally, in July 2012, Mullaney was charged with 35 counts of grand theft, securities fraud and tax fraud. Describing their disgust, Mullaney's victims told the court he is 'the most repugnant scum on Earth' and they hope he 'rot[s] in Hell'. Former Navy SEAL Alexander Sonnenberg, who lost $160,000 in the scheme, said in a statement: 'The worst part of my experience with Jason Mullaney is the reprehensible way he calculatingly misrepresented himself to solicit former teammates that he knew would trust him as a brother.' Navy SEAL Kevin Blackwell, who lost $10,000, said: '[Jason] made fools of all of us and, in the end, only looked out for his own interests. Abuse of brotherhood: Mullaney (left) served as part of SEAL Team Five until 2003. His victims said he capitalized on their sense of brotherhood and promised them profits but used the money to gamble . 'He didn’t care about my daughter’s college fund or anyone else, their financial futures, impacts on their families, or their livelihood.' The court heard one of the investors, Steven Elias, was forced to re-enlist after 30 years' service, despite being eligible for retirement. In 2009, after Elias invested, his mother contracted Alzheimer's, then her house burned down, and within the year, she died. His two-year-old son was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in January 2010, and died 11 months later. All the while, he and his wife Kirsten were grappling to deal with thousands of dollars of debt. Mrs Elias told the court: 'Our family was stricken with the worst situation any parent could possibly have to face. We are devastated beyond belief.' According to Fox News, one of the duped men Andrew Cuevas claimed Mullaney tied him up with duct tape and cut off his pinkie finger with garden shears when he approach him about the debt. Mullaney was never charged in the alleged incident.","Jason Mullaney, 43, set up Trident Global claiming to fund small firms .

At its highest it was 220/120 (a healthy reading is 140/90). I had an emergency caesarean at eight months because my blood pressure was so high it could have triggered a stroke. Sophie was healthy, but I was in hospital for three weeks because my blood pressure did not go down. I was put on high doses of medication and warned that a second baby could be dangerous as my pre-eclampsia could worsen next time. Ever since, I've visited my GP every three months to check my blood pressure and medication. But despite different pills and combinations, my blood pressure has remained at around 180/100. I've tried to cut it by staying a healthy weight, avoiding adding salt to food, and exercising frequently. Doctors said it was probably hereditary - my grandfather died of a stroke at 29, and my uncle at 65. Three years ago, things got worse. I spent a week with constant pins and needles in my arms and my blood pressure went as high as 220/110. I was immediately sent to A&E - I had to stay in hospital for observation for 30 hours as doctors feared I was having a heart attack. Then I was referred to a cardiologist. I was on five different blood pressure drugs, with side-effects, including excruciating migraines that lasted up to three days. In 2012 I was referred to Dr Mel Lobo, a hypertension specialist. Tests showed an enlarged heart muscle - a sign it's damaged. My high blood pressure meant my heart had to work harder to pump blood round my body. Dr Lobo gave me a liquid medication called nifedipine, which helped a bit, but when he said there was a mechanical solution I was keen to try it. He said it would involve having a small metal clip implanted in my thigh - it would join a vein and an artery together, so some blood from the artery could leak into the vein, reducing my blood pressure. I would be part of a clinical trial. I had the hour-long procedure in June 2013. First I had local anaesthetic around my groin and they inserted a thin hollow tube into an artery leading to my heart to monitor my blood pressure. Then they inserted the implant in my right thigh. The teacher from Welling, Kent, had an implant fitted in her right thigh . On the operating table my blood pressure dropped to 120/70. It was painful despite the anaesthetic and my right leg was bruised and swollen - I was off work for six weeks. My blood pressure is now around 140/70, slightly raised but a great improvement. I still take some medication, including nifedipine, but it's nothing compared with the cocktail of drugs I used to have. Tests have shown my enlarged heart muscle is starting to heal itself. I no longer live in fear of a heart attack or stroke, or have debilitating side-effects from the drugs. It's a huge relief. THE SPECIALIST . Number of people in the UK believed to have undiagnosed high blood pressure . Dr Mel Lobo is director of the hypertension clinic at Barts Health NHS Trust in London. We need pressure to push blood from the heart to the arteries and the major organs, then back to the heart again. The problem is if your blood pressure is high - which affects more than 15 million Britons - the heart has to work harder to pump blood, which weakens it. Increased pressure can also damage artery walls, and can cause a blockage, leading to a stroke or a heart attack. In a blood pressure reading, the top number (systolic pressure) is the pressure exerted when the heart contracts and pushes blood around the body. The lower number (diastolic pressure) refers to when the heart relaxes between beats. A healthy reading is around 120/80 but high blood pressure is anything above 140/90. She still takes some medication but it's nothing compared with the cocktail of drugs she used to . We try to treat hypertension with lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, reducing alcohol and salt. But high blood pressure can be hereditary, so these may not have an effect. Some patients need medication for the rest of their life. It can include ACE inhibitors, which relax blood vessels, and beta-blockers, which make the heart beat more slowly. Calcium channel blockers widen arteries, and diuretics flush excess water and salt . But all have potential side-effects - ACE inhibitors can trigger a cough, diuretics can lead to erectile dysfunction. And in about 500,000 patients, conventional medical therapy fails to control high blood pressure. There are now alternative, device-based treatments for helping these patients bring down their blood pressure. One is the Coupler device, a paper clip-sized implant inserted in the upper thigh under local anaesthetic. It affects how blood circulates round the body - we effectively transfer blood from a major artery into a major vein, which reduces systolic blood pressure. Once implanted, the Coupler lowers blood pressure by more than 15 per cent and this reduction seems to be long lasting. In a clinical trial of 83 patients, 44 patients were given the device. They experienced significant, lasting reduction in blood pressure, according to a study published last month in the Lancet. The procedure involves making a 2mm incision in the groin and inserting thin tubes into two key blood vessels, the femoral artery and vein. We put a guide wire in to pierce another vein and artery higher in the groin. We then insert the nickel titanium alloy implant; this joins these two vessels together and keeps this passageway open. When blood pressure in the artery becomes dangerously high, small amounts of pressurised blood flows safely from the artery into the vein, reducing blood pressure. The effect is immediate for some, for others it takes a few hours. The procedure is reversible but has not been needed so far. It does have a potential side-effect. Most patients developed leg swelling - the implant can narrow the artery, causing an increase in blood flow in the vein above it, which can lead to swelling. This is often rectifiable with diuretic medication to flush water from the body. However, 29 per cent of patients need a stent - a small tube - inserted in the narrowed arteries to treat the problem. ANY DRAWBACKS? 'The implant is relatively simple to insert, and reversible, the downside is that you undergo a procedure,' says Tom MacDonald, president of the British Hypertension Society and professor of clinical pharmacology at the University of Dundee. 'Some side-effects we know - problems at the insertion site and leg swelling - but some are still unknown, as relatively few people have been treated this way. 'More research could let us help patients with hard-to-control hypertension. But more study is needed before it can be recommended for routine NHS use.'

"After being self-conscious about her size for years, Whitney Thore says she has never been happier now that she weighs 27 stone (378lbs). The 30-year-old from North Carolina became famous in 2014 when a YouTube video of her performing called 'Fat Girl Dancing' went viral. After uploading the clip, it quickly attracted millions of views and Whitney has now been given her own reality TV show as a result. Scroll down for video . From YouTube to reality TV star: Whitney Thore, pictured on Lorraine today, has been given her own show following the popularity of her video 'Fat Girl Dancing' Speaking to Lorraine Kelly on Lorraine this morning, Whitney said: 'I hope women can see someone they can identify with because bigger women are grossly under-represented in the media. 'I hope I can be an inspiration.' Whitney said she wants to use the TV show to prove size doesn't have to be a barrier to happiness. She said: 'So often we think our bodies limit us. 'For years, I didn't think I had permission to dance even though it's what makes me happiest. 'I just hope everyone knows you can do whatever you want.' At 27st, Whitney says she 'fat and fabulous': She wants to show size isn't a barrier to success . To a large extent, Whitney has already proved this with her video 'Fat Girl Dancing', which has received millions of hits since she uploaded it to YouTube. The clip shows her energetically performing a professional-looking dance routine in a vest top and leggings. She revealed on Lorraine how she used to love dancing when she was a teenager and a size 10. But she stopped after her weight increased when she started at university because of polycystic ovaries syndrome (PCSO). The 30-year-old thinks large women are under represented on TV so wants to change that with her TLC show . Whitney, pictured on her show which airs tomorrow, says she gained weight in part thanks to PCOS . She said: 'I never blamed all my weight gain on PCSO but it's certainly a contributing factor, coupled with the shame and stigma I suffered being a fat woman in America. 'When I started college, I gained 100lb in one year. 'I was undiagnosed for years and it totally turned my life around. 'I had body issues for years, even when I was thin I had eating disorders, so to become fat and deal with the social and cultural perceptions of that and how the world viewed me... with every pound my value seemed to decrease.' But Whitney said once she accepted her size and started dancing again, she started feeling more confident. So much so that she's willing to show off her figure in just a bikini as the cameras follow her as she hits the beach for her new reality series. She said: 'I'm 380lbs, I would love to lose some weight but I'm also the happiest I have ever been.' She added that while she realises her physical health would be improved if she lost weight, because her size makes her at higher risk of heart disease and diabetes, she has learnt happiness is not about what you look like. Whitney said: 'I want to lose weight but not I'm not obsessed with being skinny for the way it looks. 'We place too much importance on the physical body and how people see us but happiness starts inside. 'We have this belief that fat people can't be pretty or smart or talented, I would love to dispel some of those stereotypes. I am fat and fabulous.' Whitney: Fat Girl Dancing is on at 9pm on TLC .","Whitney found fame after uploading a Fat Girl Dancing video to YouTube .

"A naked man sporting a cowboy hat was taken in by authorities after he was seen walking on a Michigan highway covered with snow. Footage of the man's barefoot I-75 trek in Auburn Hills was uploaded to YouTube on Sunday by user Francis Gojcaj. 'A man, roughly 50 to 60 years old, was walking on 75 freeway in the City of Auburn Hills Michigan during a blizzard,' the video's description says. 'Yee haw cowboy lol.' Scroll down for video . Mystery: The naked man wore a cowboy hat while walking on I-75 Sunday . 'He's trying to open up car doors,' one bystander says in the clip. 'His truck's over here. Look at his truck. His clothes are all the way down the road. I just didn't want him to open a car door full of family or something, you know what I mean?' Onlookers are heard saying 'What the hell?' and 'That's nuts' as the man puts his hands on his head in front of responding officers. The Detroit News reported that the man seen on the highway Sunday is 53 years old and is a Bloomfield Hills resident. Lt. Casimir Miarka told the newspaper 'It appears that he ran off the roadway and into the ditch. The report was the man was stripping off his clothes so I would assume [the police] found his clothes nearby.' He said '[Police officers] transported him to the fire station to see what was going on, and they took him to the hospital. He was checked in and was being evaluated at the hospital.' Miarka told The Detroit Free Press that it hasn't been determined if authorities will seek charges. Gojcaj told the newspaper 'It's sad, you know, because you can only hope that there isn't some type of mental disorder here, or this man is undergoing some serious psychological issues. I have no idea what his intent was.' In a Monday blog post, Auburn Hills Police Chief Doreen Alko said 'The sergeant and the officers immediately recognized that they were probably dealing with a person who was suffering from what we know as ""Excited Delirium Syndrome.""' Authorities: The naked man put his hands up on his highway in front of rseponding officers . Alko wrote that 'The victims are usually male (average age 36); have a history of stimulant use like cocaine, meth, PCP, LSD.' 'These victims also tend to have a history of a preexisting psychological disorder and are likely to be chronic users after a binge,' Alko wrote. 'I don’t know if this man fit the entire profile but it is likely he fit enough of it to end up in this state. 'Their bodies overheat in an extreme way which is why they take off their clothes. They are very incoherent and usually combative. They are not generally cooperative with the police so a struggle can ensue in which their body further overheats and they can go into sudden cardiac arrest. If the officers aren’t prepared with medical nearby, the victim can die. Alko wrote that 'The officers did their best to assist the family with the next steps. It is a difficult challenge for family members. I hope they are able to find sufficient help for him.'","Video of the man's barefoot I-75 trek in Auburn Hills was uploaded to YouTube on Sunday .

"Police are using a database of up to 18million mugshots to identify suspects despite no proper legal framework being in place. Forces across England and Wales have begun setting up the huge library of images without telling the Home Office or watchdogs. Many on the database would have been pictured on arrest but then not charged with any crime. However, their pictures remain on file indefinitely. Forces have begun setting up the huge library of images without telling the Home Office or watchdogs . Police can search the photo library for suspects using facial recognition technology. But biometrics commissioner Alastair MacGregor said last night that he was concerned about the implications of 'hundreds of thousands' of innocent people being in the system. He told BBC Newsnight that he was also worried about the risk of 'dangerous' false matches as there had not been enough rigorous testing of facial recognition systems. Mr MacGregor was appointed as the Government's first biometrics commissioner in March 2013 with the task of scrutinising official use of DNA and fingerprint profiles. He said: 'My concern is not simply that important privacy and civil liberties issues have not been addressed.' Although the technology could be 'tremendously useful' in fighting crime, he was concerned at the public's attitude. 'Its value will be very significantly undermined if the public cannot have confidence in it and cannot feel there are proper controls,' he warned. Mr MacGregor said the High Court had told police in 2012 to put rules in place about the proper use of mugshots but they had not done so. 'There is always a danger that if you can do something then you will do it, the technology takes over... without giving the attention to the other issues that arise,' he said. Mr MacGregor was also concerned about the reliability of the technology as a false match could 'easily send an investigation off into the completely wrong direction'. David Davis said: 'You cannot treat innocent people the same way you treat guilty people. You should not misuse the data in this way. No facial recognition software is 100 per cent reliable' Chief Constable Mike Barton, the national police lead on facial recognition, said the database was playing a valuable role but admitted it had 'no legislative framework'. Leicestershire Police said the facial recognition system it began using last year had proved invaluable. A spokesman said the force has 100,000 photos and the software was 100 per cent reliable if there were clear images. But David Davis, former Tory shadow home secretary, said: 'You cannot treat innocent people the same way you treat guilty people. You should not misuse the data in this way. No facial recognition software is 100 per cent reliable.' Liberal Democrat Cabinet Office minister David Laws has demanded urgent action to regulate the use of the database, Newsnight reported. The Home Office said it was reviewing the legal framework for the use of these images.","Forces in England and Wales have begun setting up huge library of images .

"Chocolate lovers have expressed their anger after Cadbury announced plans to reduce the size of their family blocks by ‘one row’ in a cost cutting deal. Unlike rival Nestle’s move to reduce the size of Killer Pythons and Smarties last year because of the Australian obesity crisis, Cadbury is shrinking the size of their popular chocolate treat in order to save money. The best-selling blocks, which currently weigh in at 220 grams, will be downsized by 10 per cent. The Australasia managing director for Mondelez International, Cadbury’s parent company, Amanda Banfield told the Financial Review: ‘Clearly any chocolate lover is going to be a bit disappointed.’ Anticipating a backlash, Ms Banfield explained the company had decided the shrink the family block because of ‘unprecedented cost headwinds’. Cadbury will reduce the size of their family block by one row of chocolate . She blamed the increased price of ingredients and rising packaging costs for the change. Cadbury still recommends the blocks are sold for $4.99 – a price which won’t increase or decrease – but Ms Banfield highlighted that shops set the prices that they choose to sell the products at in store. Cadbury's parent company’s profit before tax rose 46 per cent from $87 million to $127 million in 2013. In 2013, Tony Abbott promised the Liberal Government would help boost jobs at Cadbury with a $16 million contribution to factory upgrades. In 2014, Mr Abbott defended the decision to provide the funding but the money has not yet been provided. Ms Banfield said: 'We're waiting for a final outcome.' Thousands of angry chocolate fans have complained about the change on Cadbury’s Facebook page. Cadbury received thousands of angry comments when they announced the news on their Facebook page . Rebecca Isaako wrote: ‘You turned a $127 million dollar profit last financial year. This is complete & utter baloney!’ Kyria Economidis said: ‘What do you take us for? You guys are thieves, you want to cut it down and charge us the same? You are plain greedy.’ ‘Good bye Cadbury it has been a fun ride, but when you make it not worth it and unaffordable and then lie pffft not worth wasting my money how much would it cost to change the size of the chocolate with new moulds smaller packaging lots of money I would assume. I'll just wait for the tim tams to go on sale,’ Kirsty Logan commented. Cadbury chocolate produced for the Australian market is made in Claremont in Tasmania . Michele Forrest wrote: ‘So the slogan will be.......with 3/4 glass of milk in every block. Boo to you Cadbury. What a load of rubbish.’ Steven Jeffery added: ‘FFS Cadbury!! You expect us Aussies to support you & continue to buy your products... But you are continuously down grading your products!! Be fair now!!’ The change is expected to affect the standard milk chocolate blocks along with the many variations including the fruit and nut, rocky road, Crunchie flavoured and Turkish Delight versions. Cadbury chocolate produced for the Australian market is made in Claremont in Tasmania. A statement on the company’s website reads: ‘Over the next few weeks, you will see something different about Cadbury family blocks. While our commitment to providing the same taste and quality of Cadbury chocolate you love remains, you will see a change in the size of our 210g/220g family blocks.’ Cadbury's parent company Mondelez Australia Holdings shows the firm's profit before tax rose 46 per cent from $87 million to $127 million in 2013 . It continued: ‘Confectionery companies around the world are feeling the squeeze of increasing costs. At Cadbury, we’re feeling it too. We’ve reached a point where we can no longer absorb these increasing costs into the price of our chocolate blocks. ‘So we had to make a tough decision: increase the recommended price of Cadbury family blocks, or decrease the size? We chose to keep Cadbury chocolate affordable for families across Australia and reduce our family blocks by one row. ‘By making this change, Cadbury can continue to support local manufacturing in Australia as we have done for almost a century now. We’ll keep delighting you with new flavours and products, and your Cadbury chocolate will continue to taste as delicious as it always has. 'We know this is important to Australians. This change lets us keep making Australia’s favourite chocolate, so you can continue to enjoy the taste and quality of Cadbury.’ Cadbury posted this statement on their Facebook page to explain the changes to chocolate lovers .

"Relaxing by a pool, flying on private jets and preparing for live gigs in front of thousands of screaming fans, this selection of rare pictures give a fascinating glimpse in to the Rolling Stones and Beatles early touring days. Taken during the British music invasion of the US in the Swinging Sixties, they show behind-the-scenes shots of the iconic bands on the road. The limited edition pictures were captured by Bob Bonis, the US tour manager for both the bands from 1964 to 1966. The selection includes Mick Jagger relaxing in a swimming pool hotel in a pair of tight red swimming trunks, John Lennon winding down after a show in a stripy jacket and trademark glasses and Paul McCartney flicking through a newspaper on a plane. The first Beatles tour to the US (in 1964) saw them arrive at New York to an uproarious crowd of 3,000 to greet them. They gave their first live US television two days later, watched by approximately 73 million viewers in more than 23 million households. On February 11, 1964, Beatlemania gripped the US as the band played their first concert at the Washington Coliseum in front of more than 8,000 adoring fans. The Beatles returned to the US in August 1964, and again in August 1965 and 1966. By contrast, the Rolling Stones' first US tour, in June 1964, was in former bass player Bill Wyman's words, 'a disaster'. He said: 'When we arrived, we didn't have a hit record (there) or anything going for us.' But during the tour they recorded for two days at Chess Studios in Chicago, producing what would become their first number 1 hit in the UK: their cover of Bobby and Shirley Womack's 'It's All Over Now'. The Stones went on to achieve their first US number 1 in 1965 with 'Satisfaction (I Can't Get No).' The original images from the Bob Bonis Archive will be sold on eBay, offering music enthusiasts and collectors the opportunity to  own a piece of rock history. A spokesman for eBay said: 'As tour manager and friend, Bob Bonis had unprecedented access to life on the road with two of the world's greatest bands. 'His contribution to rock history is a magnificent collection of more than 5,000 candid photographs of intimate and unguarded moments – from a never-before-seen Rolling Stones recording session at Chess Records Studio in Chicago to the only close up photographs of the Beatles' 1965 stadium performance in Minnesota.'

"A 26-year-old man who had been on the run for five days after allegedly shooting dead five people including his wife and her 16-year-old daughter has been arrested, police have said. Thomas Lee reportedly gunned down his wife, Christie Lee, 33, her daughter, Bailey Burtron, and his parents-in-law, Sheila and William Burtron,  68 and 69, at their Georgia home on Wednesday. He then fatally shot 18-year-old Iiaonna Green, who was living with the family at the suburban LaGrange property at the time, before fleeing the scene and going on the run, it is alleged. However, five days later, Lee has been arrested by police following a massive manhunt. He was located in the Mississippi city of Tupelo, around 270 miles from his home. Scroll down for video . Arrest: Thomas Lee, who had been on the run for five days after allegedly shooting dead five people including his wife, Christie Lee (pictured with Lee) and her 16-year-old daughter, has been arrested, police have said . Victims: Lee reportedly gunned down his 33-year-old wife, her daughter, Bailey Burtron (left), her parents Sheila and William Burtron, aged 68 and 69 , and family friend Iiaonna Green (right), 18, at their Georgia home . Killed: Sheila (right) and William (left) Burton were among the victims apparently shot dead by their son-in-law . According to CBS, the suspect was tracked down to a bus station at 4.30pm on Monday following a tip. He is being held at the Lee County Adult Detention Center on five charges of malice murder. Police were first alerted to the mass murder on Saturday night after Mr Burtron's co-workers became concerned that he had missed a couple of days work without contacting them, it is reported. When sheriff's deputies arrived at the property, they saw the families' cars parked outside and rang the doorbell multiple times. After no-one answered, they forced their way into the house. Inside, the deputies discovered the five victims' bodies. Mr Burton's corpse was sprawled across the kitchen floor, while the other four victims had been slain in three separate bedrooms. Investigators later determined Mrs Lee, Miss Burtron and her grandparents and Miss Green had been dead for around three days. They had each been shot, but no weapon was recovered. Police immediately began searching for Lee, who was not present at the scene. By Monday, they had obtained arrest warrants charging the suspect with five counts of malice murder. Happier times: After shooting his five victims, Lee (pictured, back, with his wife and Bailey) fled the scene and went on the run, it is alleged. However, five days later, he has been arrested by police following a manhunt . Crime scene: Lee was located in the Mississippi city of Tupelo, around 270 miles (a four-hour drive) away from his home. Above, an agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation walks towards Lee's home on Monday . Blocked off to traffic: Law enforcement, TV crews and neighbors' cars line the street leading up to the house . During the wide-scale search for Lee, Troup County Sheriff James Woodruff told the media that he believed the suspect may be driving an olive green Mazda Tribute SUV with Georgia license plates. 'If this happened Wednesday night and he left immediately, he's got five days that he could be anywhere,' Sheriff Woodruff said in a phone interview on Monday before Lee was found. 'We canvassed the entire neighborhood and talked to next door neighbors and people down the street, and nobody saw or heard a thing.' He added that the U.S. Marshals Service had been called in to assist, and that investigators were following up on tips from people who may have seen the suspect in Tennessee, Florida and Ohio. Distance: Lee traveled from his LaGrange, Georgia, home to the Mississippi city of Tupelo, 267 miles away . Charged: Lee (pictured, left, and right, with his wife) was tracked down to a bus station at 4.30pm on Monday following a tip. He is being held at the Lee County Adult Detention Center on five charges of malice murder . Autopsies were being conducted on Monday. Sheriff Woodruff cautioned that although the victims appear to have been shot, officials cannot be certain until the autopsies have been performed. At the time of their deaths, the Burtrons, the Lees and Miss Green were living in a quiet suburb outside LaGrange, about 80 miles southwest of Atlanta and just east of the Alabama state line. No prior domestic problems had been reported at the property, Mr Woodruff said.

"At school I always bridled at teachers who referred to us as ‘young people’. Invariably they were icky groovers, smelling of toothpaste and piety. Yesterday the same rebellion rose in my gorge while watching a creepy Sky News-Facebook TV show that forced party leaders to matey up to selected yoofs. Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, David Cameron and that Aussie from the Greens took turns to be quizzed. The programme, Stand Up And Be Counted (did they mean the ratings figures?), was all about ‘young people’ and their alleged indifference to electoral politics. The camera angles were look-at-me edgy, all wobbly with up-the-nose shots. Oh, please. Selfie: Ed Miliband (pictured second from left) poses for a photo with the Sky News/Facebook youngsters . The late-teen/early 20s inquisitors, pretty plainly politics obsessives, soon had Mr Miliband in trouble by asking what ‘life experience’ he had to be PM. Odd Ed should have said ‘more than you, wonkface’ or ‘It’s the middle of the day, why aren’t you festering in your bed?’. Instead he scrunched his lips and claimed, in that frogman-still-wearing-a-snorkel voice, that ‘ah’ve done a number of things’. He had been a Treasury spin doctor and had briefly taught (politics) at Harvard. That had given him ‘the ability, I hope, to engage and listen to people’. Normal 20-somethings would have treated this lame answer to hog-whimpering derision and armfarts. The political trainspotters recruited by Sky heard it in respectful silence. Mr Clegg, when his turn came, discarded his tie – hey, look, I’m a cool guy! – and went all glottal-stoppy and Northern English. His Pied Piper of Hamlyn act was embarrassing, belittling, wet – just like the programme. Public school-educated Cleggy started saying ‘coontry’ instead of ‘country’, ‘loonchtime’ instead of ‘lunchtime’. We had ‘kindof’ this and ‘kinda’ that, and he gave his sentences a California-surfer uplift. What a fraud. Yet the credulous boobies fell for it. Thus is our politics infantilised. Enter David Cameron. At least he and Ed Mil’ kept their ties on. He was asked what he thought about Prime Minister’s Questions (one of the so-called youngsters, who actually looked quite middle-aged, trotted out the Establishment view that rowdiness in the Commons is disgraceful). The late-teen/early 20s inquisitors soon had Mr Miliband (pictured centre) in trouble by asking what ‘life experience’ he had to be PM . Mr Cameron was also asked about the price of tampons. The show was fronted by Sky’s political editor, one Faisal Islam. Amazing to think this chump is successor to the serious, worldly Adam Boulton. In his shiny suit, the twinkly-eyed Islam could have been an under-manager at a boutique hotel. He kept mewing about what ‘young people’ were interested in. To keep the little darlings interested, the producers had laid on ping-pong, table football, a sweetie stall. Islam’s co-presenter Jayne Secker showed us these and even announced that there was ‘a break-out zone, as young people call it’. After the show Islam and Secker repeatedly told us how ‘extraordinary’ the programme had been. Right! The Greens’ Natalie Bennett, in her session, announced she wanted ‘peaceful political revolution’. Given that this involved encouraging more immigration and scrapping council tenants’ right-to-buy, it was open to question how peaceful such a revolution could be. David Cameron (pictured) was asked about Prime Minister's Questions - and the price of tampons . Nick Clegg (pictured right) discarded his tie and went all glottal-stoppy and Northern English. His Pied Piper of Hamlyn act was embarrassing, belittling and wet . But her views went little challenged. Ms Bennett said she had been a feminist since the age of five. Haven’t we all, dear? There was no sign of Ukip’s Nigel Farage. Apparently he was in Europe. Perhaps he had spotted a stitch-up in the offing. Instead it was Ed Miliband who was kippered, and not just with that excruciating piffle about his ‘life experience’. After his main session, he was pursued by a scruffy Sky hack who in a selfie-stick interview asked what Ed had done when he was 18. Our hero said he had been just like any other teenager, really: he had lived in New York with his Marxist-historian father, had ‘cared a lot about the world, been very interested in British politics and global issues’ – and had ‘drunk a bit too much’. Do we believe him? Is the problem with Ed Miliband not that, rather like the eggheads assembled at yesterday’s patronising Sky/Facebook stunt, he has perhaps never drunk quite enough?","Leaders attended Sky News-Facebook show, Stand Up And Be Counted .

"A vicious brawl which allegedly occurred on a city trolley in Philadelphia is now under investigation after video footage of the event was leaked on social media. YouTube user Brian Gregory candidly filmed the apparent attack, where one man is seen on the ground being kicked while a woman in the background gets hit on the head. The attackers are heard hurling profanity-laced abuse at their victims before it's announced that the police are coming and they flee the scene. The incident took place on Saturday night around 11:20pm. Other commuters are seen looking helpless as the violent scene kicks off. A spokesperson for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority told MailOnline that the fight was between high school students who were known to each other and, by chance, met on the westbound route 10 trolley. The two victims are not cooperating with the current investigation in process.

"Now this is how you guarantee that your guests have a memorable hotel stay. When one guest checked in to the Hotel Indigo San Antonio Riverwalk during a business trip to Texas, the bored traveller decided to have a little fun with the hotel staff. Sarah Kovacs Grzywacz received a text, which she believed to be automated, when she first arrived, asking if she needed anything during her stay. Business traveller Sarah Kovacz Grzywacz asked hotel concierge for an image of Nicolas Cage for her room . Bored during her business conference, Sarah Kovacs Grzywacz responded to the hotel's text - with one particularly odd request. 'I got this text when I checked into the Hotel Indigo San Antonio Riverwalk basically letting me know if I needed anything,' Grzywacz explained to Viral Nova. 'I asked for a framed picture of Nic Cage in Con Air. When I got an affirmative response, I thought it was auto generated and went about my day.' After the Hotel Indigo San Antonio Riverwalk staff obliged, Grzywacz continued their interaction, asking for another photo of Nic (along with bath towels) to be placed in the bathroom . When she arrived home around 6pm, sadly, no photograph of the Hollywood actor had been delivered . But hotel concierge Ramon delivered on his promise and delivered a film still of the actor along with a Post-It note that read, 'Sweet dreams! Enjoy!' Amused, Grzywacz made another strange request. This time, she asked for a photo of the actor in Moonstruck to be attached to her bathroom mirror. She also asked for some bath towels. But the dedicated staff delivered the requested image and towels soon after - along with a personalised note . Her final request? An image of Nic Cage in his hit film 8MM to be attached next to the television . The hotel staff once again delivered - taping a printed out photo of the actor to the side of the TV . When she returned back at 8pm and found that her request had not been completed, she sent a follow up text. The hotel staff was apologetic and quickly delivered her towels, along with a photo of the star and a note that said: 'Sorry I'm late! - Nick.' For her last trick, Grzywacz asked for one final image of the Hollywood actor to be delivered to her room - a photo of the actor in 8MM to be taped to the television screen. 'Good choice!' Ramon replied and the image soon appeared in her hotel room. Grzywacz then uploaded these hilarious images and texts on Imgur, which have since gone viral . A little something extra! The concierge even attached one final - non-requested - image to the door . Grzywacz went on to share the photos of the attentive staff's dedication on her Imgur account, which have since gone viral. While many hotels offer services of concierges who claim to be willing to do whatever it takes, Ramon's hilarious responses show an entirely new level of commitment to ensuring guest satisfaction. Consider us booked in.","Sarah Kovacs Grzywacz had many strange requests during her hotel stay .

"An inspection report which failed the first privately-run NHS hospital made at least 200 errors, the watchdog has admitted. The Care Quality Commission last month declared Hinchingbrooke, Cambridgeshire, was inadequate, with the lowest ever patient care score. That same day, Circle, the private firm running the exemplary hospital, pulled out of its contract. Scroll down for video . Protest: The Friends of Hinchingbrooke group show support for the hospital after the CQC report . But there are growing suspicions the inspection was a stitch-up, heavily influenced by Labour figures and other individuals who oppose privatisation. They include an inspector who was a member of Keep Our NHS Public and another who had warned of the dangers of private firms’ involvement in the NHS. Yesterday, CQC chief David Behan admitted to the Public Accounts Committee that the report contained about 200 inaccuracies, from false allegations against staff, and mistakes in data about care, to basic but sloppy typing errors. Committee member Stewart Jackson, Tory MP for Peterborough, described the CQC as a ‘lynch mob’. He asked Mr Behan: ‘What is it, a used car salesmanship? It is supposed to be a proper regulatory body. This is why one of your own staff admitted it was a lynch mob … you should be ashamed of yourself.’ He added: ‘Are you fit for purpose for judging an organisation which in May 2014 was winning awards … whereas within four or five months your report, based on anecdotes, some might say tittle-tattle, rates it as inadequate and one of the worst inspections the CQC has ever undertaken?’ MP Stewart Jackson described the CQC as a 'lynch mob' and a 'used car salesmanship' The MPs were told some of the report’s most serious allegations were in fact misunderstandings by the watchdog. In one instance, an inspector claimed to have heard an A&E doctor shouting abusively at a patient. It later transpired the doctor was speaking loudly to the man because he was profoundly deaf. A student nurse criticised by the CQC for telling a patient ‘you know what happens when you misbehave’, was found to have been sharing a joke with him to make him feel more comfortable so he would eat. Senior Circle managers told MPs they had found 300 inaccuracies in the report. The CQC has since admitted to about two thirds of these but has refused to change the ‘inadequate’ rating. Hisham Abdel-Rahman, chief executive of Hinchingbrooke, said he had asked the CQC to provide written notes to back up its allegations but it has so far failed to do so. The hospital will now be put back in the hands of the NHS. But it is deemed unprofitable and there are fears it will be closed or taken over by a larger hospital. It has also emerged a senior NHS manager who oversaw the flawed contract for Circle’s takeover walked away with a £400,000 pay-off. Sir Neil McKay was chief of the Midlands and East Strategic Health Authority when the deal was signed in 2011. But in 2012 when the authority was abolished he received £465,000 in redundancy pay with a pension pot valued at £2million. MPs heard he is still being paid by the NHS as he has set up a consultancy advising organisations in the Midlands. There are growing suspicions the inspection of Hinchingbrooke Hospital, in Cambridgeshire, was a stitch-up, heavily influenced by Labour figures and other individuals who oppose privatisation . Following Circle’s takeover in February 2012, Hinchingbrooke’s A&E waiting times and those for cancer patients were among the lowest in the NHS. Patient satisfaction scores went up and in May last year it was rated the top hospital in the country by healthcare data monitors CHKS. But an investigation by this newspaper last month revealed the deal may have been doomed from the start as members of the local NHS body opposed privatisation. The Clinical Commissioning Group slashed the hospital’s finances and imposed arbitrary fines. Two members are Labour activists, including chairman Maureen Donnelly, formerly a senior TUC member. There are concerns the report was heavily influenced by the opinions of anti-privatisation inspectors – including Dr Jonathan Fielden, previously a senior member of doctors’ union the British Medical Association, who had warned of the dangers of privatisation. Another inspector, Dr Nigel Sturrock, had been a signed-up supporter of Keep Our NHS Public since its launch in 2005. The CQC has since said it will force inspectors to disclose links to organisations which may distort their opinions.","Inspection report which failed privately-run NHS hospital had 200 errors .

"Drinking lots of cola could affect your bones . We're drinking more soft drinks than ever before - on average, 25 gallons each a year. But what is it doing to our health? Last week, U.S. researchers suggested that girls who frequently had fizzy drinks were more likely to start puberty early. And it's not just sugary drinks - diet versions, even sparkling water, can have an effect on health, as ANGELA EPSTEIN reports... 1. They speed up ageing . People who drink the equivalent of two cans of full-sugar cola daily may age more quickly than people who never drink it, say U.S. researchers. Last year, scientists at the University of California found these people had DNA changes that made their cells 4.6 years older - their telomeres, the tiny 'caps' that protect the ends of our chains of DNA, were shorter. 'Telomere length has an impact on cell repair and regeneration and that is linked to the ageing process,' says Dr Sajjad Rajpar, a consultant dermatologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.' 'A great deal of research is looking at how telomere length can affect that process.' 2. They trigger sugar cravings . Drinking just two cans of sugary fizzy drinks a day dulls people's perceptions of sweet tastes and makes them crave sugar even more, says Dr Hans-Peter Kubis, a physiologist at the University of Bangor who led a study into the effects of fizzy drinks on the body. 'Because sweetness is strongly connected to the reward system in the brain, people may increase the frequency of their use of sugar as a result.' The bubbles, too, could make you want more sugar. Carbon dioxide acts as an acid which enhances our responses to other tastes, such as sugar, says Dr Kubis. 'Though the sugar may create the craving responses, the acidity or fizz of the drink makes the pleasantness of the taste even stronger. This could explain why people prefer carbonated water over still.' 3. They have been linked to cancer . Women who have more than three sugary drinks - fizzy or otherwise - a week may have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Last year, researchers from Laval University in Quebec found that the more sugary and fizzy drinks consumed by women, the greater the density of their breasts - a known risk factor for cancer. It is not clear how the two might be linked and more research is needed. 'Women with dense breasts have a higher risk of developing cancer because there are more cells that can become cancerous,' explains Dr Anne Trigg, a medical oncologist at the London Bridge Hospital. 'It can increase the risk factor four-fold. It may be linked to higher levels of oestrogen, which is associated with breast cancer.' Drinking just two cans of sugary fizzy drinks a day dulls people's perceptions of sweet tastes . 4. They may damage bones . Drinking large quantities of cola could affect your bones, U.S. researchers have suggested. This is because they often contain high levels of phosphoric acid - added to cola-type drinks to give them a tangy taste, and tingle when swallowed. A 2006 study by nutritional epidemiologists at Tufts University in Boston found that women who drank cola daily had lower bone mineral density in their hips than those who drank it once a week, regardless of their age, total calcium intake or use of cigarettes and alcohol. The body naturally strives to maintain balanced levels of calcium and phosphorus - so when there is excess phosphorus, calcium is released from the bones to correct the balance. Researchers didn't find this effect when women drank other fizzy drinks. It's possible that the caffeine in the cola had an impact, since caffeine has been associated with risk of lower bone density. If you suffer from bloating, the extra gas will make it worse . The National Osteoporosis Society says that while there is 'no clear evidence' of fizzy drinks having a detrimental effect on bone health, women may want to moderate their intake. The other problem is that people prefer fizzy drinks to calcium-rich milk, adds Dr Peter Selby, an osteoporosis expert based at Manchester Royal Infirmary. 5. They cause bloating . When we have a fizzy drink, the gas - namely carbonic acid - fills the stomach with air, creating pressure which pushes the air back up the gullet (or oesophagus) causing a belch. And if you suffer from bloating, the extra gas will make it worse, says Dr Steven Mann, a consultant gastroenterologist at the Royal Free Hospital in London, as the air will simply sit in the stomach. These bubbles eventually burst and get reabsorbed into the blood, he adds. Fizzy drinks can also aggravate irritable bowel syndrome, a disorder linked to digestive system problems. 6. They attack your teeth . Sugar reacts with the bacteria in plaque (the sticky coating on your teeth) and produces harmful acids that can cause decay, making sugary fruit juices a threat to oral health. But fizzy drinks may cause even greater damage. A study by the University of Birmingham found that full-sugar cola is ten times as corrosive as fruit juices in the first three minutes of drinking, even though they contain similar amounts of sugar. It's thought citric acid added to give drinks their tangy taste might be to blame. 'Even diet colas, though low in sugar, can be bad for teeth, because of the citric acid in diet and sweetened fizzy drinks,' said Professor Damian Walmsley, scientific adviser to the British Dental Association. Fizzy water can also damage teeth because it contains carbonic acid, formed when carbon dioxide is dissolved in water, which erodes tooth enamel. 'Even one glass can cause microscopic levels of the outer surface of the enamel to dissolve, and when we consume something acidic, the mouth stays acidic for 45 minutes before returning to a normal pH level,' says Professor Andrew Eder of University College London's Eastman Dental Institute. However, you'd need to drink sparkling water on a daily basis for years to suffer the effect - one or two glasses a week won't hurt. 7. They bombard your liver . Fizzy drinks with high levels of fruit juice have been linked to fatty liver disease. A 2009 Israeli study found that people who have two cans of fizzy fruit drinks a day were five times more likely to develop the condition, a precursor to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and liver cancer. The drinks have high levels of fruit sugar, readily absorbed by the liver and converted into fat. And upmarket fizzy drinks are no healthier as sparkling elderflower and sports drinks can contain up to 13tsp of sugar, compared with around 9tsp in supermarket cola, campaign group Action on Sugar said last year. Although the evidence is inconclusive the study suggests diet drinks have a similar effect by tricking the body into thinking it has had sugar. Fizzy drinks could actually be bad for children with stomach bugs . 8. They can harm a child's tummy . Flat cola or lemonade is a popular remedy for an upset stomach, but it could actually be bad for children with stomach bugs. The lining of the stomach and intestines are often temporarily damaged by stomach bugs, and high-sugar drinks can make this worse, possibly because bacteria feed off sugar, says Dr Stephen Murphy, who chaired the committee that wrote the NHS official guidelines on treating children's stomach bugs. These warned parents against giving children these drinks, saying water with oral salt solution, such as Dioralyte, is preferable as it contains the right minerals and sugar. Diet drinks can be problematic because the sweeteners may be difficult to absorb by the stomach, increasing the risk of diarrhoea says Dr Peter Fairclough, consultant gastroenterologist at the London Clinic. Whatever people think, carbonated drinks, fizzy or flat, won't get rid of bacteria causing a bad stomach, adds Alastair Forbes, professor of gastroenterology at the University of East Anglia. 9. They may bring on puberty early . Drinking more than one sugary drink a day could bring on a girl's periods early, suggested U.S. scientists last week. In a study of 6,000 adolescent girls, researchers from Harvard found that those drinking more than 1.5 sugar-sweetened beverages daily had their first period 2.7 months earlier than those who had two a week or fewer. Drinks with added sugar raise levels of insulin - the hormone that mops up glucose from the blood - which in turn may lead to higher concentrations of female sex hormones such as oestrogen. The researchers suggest this also put girls at higher risk of breast cancer, as early oestrogen exposure may increase the risk of certain types of the disease.","More than one sugary drink a day could bring on a girl's periods early .

"A Texas woman sentenced to life in prison without parole Monday for suffocating her fiance's daughter to death after he found racy texts on her phone and ended the relationship. The jury found that Melinda Muniz, now 26, killed Grace Ford on January 9, 2014 - hours after Grace's father, an Iraq War veteran, told her to move out of their Plano, Texas, apartment. 'You are pure evil,' Grace's grandmother said to Muniz in an impact statement in court, WFAA reports. 'You will never be able to touch a child again.' Murder trial: Melinda Muniz, 26, (left) is charged with killing her fiancé's two-year-old daughter Grace (right) Grace, who also suffered severe injuries to her genitalia, died when she was taken off life support three days later in hospital. Muniz did not testify at the trial, where jurors heard she had changed her story about what happened that night several times. Her attorneys rested the case without presenting evidence or calling any other witnesses, KDFW reports. 'No one wins here,' Grace's grandfather Doug Reeves said. 'We get to live without Grace.' Muniz's fiance Mitch Ford told her during his impact statement that he forgave her, saying 'I'm still angry at you. But, more than that, I am sad.' During the trial, prosecutors said Muniz originally told police she was raped and knocked unconscious by an intruder who taped Grace's mouth shut. However, after tests refuted her story, Muniz claimed she had amnesia and could not remember the past two years, Star Local Media reported. Horrific: Grace was found face-down on the bed, lifeless, with duct tape over her mouth . In a third interview, prosecutors say, Muniz said Grace put duct tape over her mouth so Muniz panicked and knocked herself unconscious with a pan. She then said that she noticed Grace had tape over her mouth, pulled it off, saw she was unconscious, put it back on, and knocked herself out. She said she 'didn't know' if it was an accident or intentional, the court heard. An investigation has since revealed Muniz was allegedly seen purchasing duct tape and zip wires hours before Grace was found lifeless on her bed with tape over her mouth and wires around the room, though Muniz claimed these were arts and crafts materials. Searches for 'duct tape' and 'kill' were also found on a MacBook recovered from the property Muniz shared with Grace and Ford, the jury heard. Muniz, who met Ford in September 2012, a year and a half after Grace was born, had acted as her caretaker  since her father won full custody in 2013. The couple met in September 2012, a year and a half after Grace was born. Babysat: Grace, pictured with her mother Emily Ward, was being babysat by Muniz when she died . He gained full custody from his ex-wife Emily Reeves Ward, who became addicted to alcohol and prescription pills after he returned from his second Iraq war and their relationship broke down. Ford said he proposed to Muniz in December 2013 but ended the relationship on January 9, the morning after he saw she had texted pictures of her in underwear to her personal trainer. He told the court: 'As I was getting ready for work, I let her know I found that stuff on her phone,' he testified. 'It wasn't a big argument or anything. I said it wasn't going to work and called off the engagement. She was kind of unemotional, like it wasn't really a big deal. 'There wasn't a fight. I provided everything for her. I told her she had a week [to move out]. She could keep the engagement ring and sell it and keep the car to drive around and look for jobs. She didn't cry, didn't appear angry.' The murder trial, which opened on Tuesday, has also heard evidence from the first emergency officers to reach the scene of the crime - who testified that Muniz appeared to be pretending to be unconscious. 'She took a big breath and kind of gently fell to the floor as if she had fainted,' Officer Camille Bowie said. 'Her eyes were kind of fluttering, like she was trying to keep them shut forcefully. There's no movement in the eyes and body when someone faints – if you really faint, you're not going to gently place yourself. I felt like it wasn't genuine.' Ford told the court he contacted police after his phone call with Muniz was cut short. He said he was at work, Muniz phoned to say she had just got home with Grace, and the phone seemingly fell to the floor. He arrived at the apartment at the same time as the officers. Muniz was lying on her front with her underwear around her ankles. Grace was in a bedroom on her front and remained unresponsive as she was taken to ER at The Medical Center of Plano. Stories: Muniz gave three different accounts of what happened before saying she doesn't know if Grace's death was an accident or intentional . She was given a dose of epinephrine which started her heart, then doctors noticed bruising and blood around her vaginal area. 'I believed Grace had been sexually assaulted,' Dr Richard Honaker testified. Deborah Davis, the health practitioner who examined Muniz for evidence of sexual assault, said: 'Other than her verbalizing, I saw nothing to indicate any sexual assault. The defendant didn't seem emotional, was pretty quiet and very cooperative.' Muniz said she had purchased duct tape, scissors, zip ties and cotton swabs from Dollar Tree for an arts and crafts project. As she began cleaning, she said Grace must have gotten scared, thinking Muniz was about to vacuum, so she ran to her bedroom and taped her mouth. Muniz explained that she donned gloves and partially removed the duct tape from Grace's mouth to see if she was OK. When it was clear Grace wasn't breathing, she panicked and put the tape back on. Then, as Grace lay unconscious, she gathered the scissors, zip ties and duct tape and disposed of it in a Dumpster across the parking lot, she said. In a recorded interview with Muniz, played to the jury, Detective Chris Jones said: 'I'm going to be straight-up honest with you: There are issues with your story. You brought up that Grace had duct tape on her when that was never mentioned. How did you know if you were unconscious?' He added that the time frame was unrealistic, saying the six minutes between the 911 call and authorities' arrival was 'not realistic' for an intruder to physically and sexually assault two people.","Melinda Muniz was found guilty of killing two-year-old Grace Ford .

"A mother and her five-month-old son were kicked off a flight following an argument with a crew member - even though she complied with her demands. Nicki Gazlay was on a connecting Frontier Airlines flight from Denver to Memphis on Wednesday when she was told to remove the youngster from an Ergo Baby carrier. She explained to the flight attendant she didn't have to do it on the previous flight, but agreed anyway and placed the youngster on her lap. Scroll down for video . Row: Nicki Gazlay was on a Frontier Airlines flight from Denver to Memphis when she was told to remove the youngster from an Ergo Baby carrier. She complied with the request but was still thrown off the flight . However, during the row, she told the crew member: 'Of course I am going to comply, I'm going to do whatever you say because you are the Queen of this airplane.' She replied by saying: 'You're off'. Gazlay was then forced to buy another ticket for a different flight on another airline. She told WMC Action News: 'No one said a thing to me and that's the same airlines.' A number of people have criticized the airline and Gazlay has now written and official letter of complaint to the company. Reaction: Nicki (pictured here with her child in the Ergo Baby Carrier) told the crew member she hadn't had to do the same on the previous flight . One person posted on Facebook saying the company should be 'ashamed' of their actions. The airline responded by saying: 'Thank you for your concern. We require all passengers to comply with FAA safety regulations and crew member instructions.' Frontier Airlines are said to be investigating what happened. They insist Ergo carriers are not approved for take-off or landing by the Federal Aviation Authority. The company suggests buying an extra ticket and bringing a car seat to get around it. Despite Gazlay's claims she was unfairly told to leave, other passengers said she became argumentative and started shouting. One person who said she was sitting a couple of rows from Gazlay wrote on Facebook: While I believe that she has a valid point about the airlines being more uniform and upfront of what the rules/regulations are in this situation, she was far from cooperative in her encounter with the flight attendant. 'The flight attendant asked her nicely several times after boarding to remove the baby from the carrier for takeoff and landing, but the young lady chose to ignore her requests. 'Instead of just complying on the last request, she became argumentative and combative about why she didn't feel it was necessary since she was not asked to comply on her previous flight'.

"Male circumcision is one of the simplest operations. Indeed, it's deemed so simple that in this country you don't even need a medical qualification to perform it on newborns or children. Circumcision has been practised for centuries, with the earliest evidence dating from the time of the pharaohs. Yet it's become a highly controversial procedure, and one that stirs strong passions - the actor Russell Crowe famously caused a Twitter storm in 2011 when he described the procedure as 'barbaric and stupid'. He later apologised. Circumcision has become a highly controversial procedure, and one that stirs strong passion (stock image) But medical experts are increasingly divided over whether circumcision should be performed. On one side of the debate is the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - America's leading public health organisation. In December it issued draft guidelines recommending the procedure for all boys, arguing circumcision protects against the risk of urinary tract infections in infants and sexually transmitted diseases in adulthood. This may be because it reduces the risk of bacteria lodging within the foreskin and reduces the risk of tiny tears to the foreskin that become an entry point for infections. The CDC guidelines also suggest that circumcision lowers the risk of men contracting herpes and the human papilloma virus, in turn protecting them against penile cancer - and cutting the risk of their passing the virus on to women, reducing their risk of cervical cancer. The CDC concluded that 'the scientific evidence is clear that the benefits outweigh the risks of physical or mental harm that may be involved'. Those in the 'no' camp say all this is based on flawed studies from Africa that have no relevance to Western populations. Furthermore it ignores research that shows no link between circumcision and the risk of sexually transmitted diseases. In December, CDC issued draft guidelines recommending the procedure for all boys (stock image) Over the past five years, doctors' groups in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Holland, Iceland and Australia have spoken out against the procedure. Their various national organisations have called for bans on the op unless it is needed on strictly medical grounds. 'A VIOLATION OF CHILDREN' The Council of Europe recently passed a resolution condemning the practice as a 'violation of the physical integrity of children'. It said circumcision can cause lifelong trauma, diminish sexual satisfaction and put children at risk of lasting physical damage. And while the World Health Organisation advocates circumcision in regions with high levels of heterosexual HIV transmission - such as in Africa - it also warns that it can cause pain, excessive bleeding, excessive skin removal, scars and deformation. The latest salvo in this debate has just been fired by Danish researchers, who claim circumcision before the age of five can double a boy's risk of autism. Writing in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine in January, the researchers suggested this may be linked to stress caused by the pain of the procedure. The study was led by Morten Frisch, a professor of sexual health epidemiology at the Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen. 'Circumcision trauma in infancy or early childhood might carry an increased risk of serious neuro-developmental and psychological consequences,' he says. Professor Frisch adds that, although painkillers are often used: 'None of the most common drugs used to reduce circumcision pain completely eliminates it. Some boys will endure strongly painful circumcisions.' However, the problem with statistical studies such as these is they only show a potential link, and don't prove a causal link. Despite male circumcision's widespread use and long tradition, the experts cannot even agree on when it is best to perform the surgery. While the Danish study suggested that children below the age of five are most at risk from psychological damage, a study by the University of Washington published last May suggested the procedure should be done in the first year of life. After this, said the researchers, infants were 20 times more likely to suffer complications. Dr Charbel El Bcheraoui, the epidemiologist who led the study, says: 'We assume this is probably because aftercare for the children's surgical wounds is more complicated between the ages of one and ten.' This is mostly because younger babies are less active and less likely to damage the wound site. WHEN CIRCUMCISION IS JUSTIFIED . Circumcision was rarely practised in Britain until the 19th century, when medical practitioners started to pronounce that it was more hygienic. As a result, routine medical circumcision became widespread in England. It gradually became less common from the Thirtiess onwards, as many doctors began to argue that it had no real medical benefit in the vast majority of cases. The figures began rising again in the Seventies, with the growth of UK Muslim and African Christian populations. Nearly one in five British boys is currently circumcised, compared with four in every five in the U.S. Most circumcisions in the UK are motivated by religious reasons or family tradition (stock image) In England and Wales, the NHS guidelines say that it will only perform circumcision on children for medical reasons, such as severe phimosis, a tight foreskin that can't be retracted, or recurrent balanitis, where the tip of the penis and foreskin become inflamed. The NHS does just 10,000 circumcisions a year. In Scotland, there are four NHS surgical theatres that circumcise all children whose parents request it, regardless of their reasons. Under guidelines set by the Royal College of Surgeons and the British Association of Paediatric Surgeons, circumcision can be performed only by children's surgeons in NHS operating theatres, where the patient is heavily sedated. Most circumcisions in the UK are motivated by religious reasons or family tradition and are performed privately, often by GPs. But circumcision can also be done informally by private individuals, and while it's illegal in the UK for lay people to tattoo anyone under the age of 18, or to perform surgery on a pet, anybody can lawfully cut the foreskin off a child, even if they have no conventional medical qualifications. Last month, England's most senior family judge, Sir James Munby, said male circumcision involved 'significant harm'. But in a High Court ruling over how councils should protect young girls who are victims of female genital mutilation - considered to be circumcision for girls - Sir James said that the law was 'prepared to tolerate non-therapeutic [ie, non-medical] male circumcision performed for religious or even for purely cultural or conventional reasons, while no longer being willing to tolerate female genital mutilation in any of its forms'. CALLS FOR STRONGER REGULATION . But should the authorities be supervising the practice more closely and ensuring it's performed to medical standards? Shiban Ahmed, a consultant paediatric surgeon at Alder Hey Hospital, Liverpool, says: 'Male circumcision became an issue for me because of the number of cases I have seen in hospitals of children who have been harmed by circumcisions performed in GP practices and other places. 'GPs working privately are doing it with local anaesthetic for around £90, all too frequently while the children are being held down, often screaming in fear. 'These doctors would not be allowed to perform medical circumcisions, but they are doing cultural and religious ones. 'The NHS guidelines for the hospital operation are the minimum standards of care for medical circumcision in this country,' he maintains. 'It is our duty to safeguard the interests of children. I believe that the operation should either be performed safely, or it should not be done at all.' Mr Ahmed says he has operated on about 26 children to repair damage done by GPs and, in one case, by an unqualified man posing as a GP. 'One child had lost the tip of their penis and I had to reconstruct it,' he says. NHS guidelines say that it will only perform circumcision on children for medical reasons (stock image) A report from Birmingham Children's Hospital in 2009 said it had admitted 105 children with such difficulties. Ten had been taken into intensive care. Last April, Taiwo Shittu, 55, was jailed for causing grievous bodily . harm after a newborn baby she circumcised had to be rushed to hospital to stop life-threatening bleeding. Shittu claimed to be a qualified nurse and midwife. She told investigators that over the previous decade she had performed many circumcisions in her South-East London home. The court, which heard she had no professional qualifications, jailed her for 30 months. The case bears disturbing parallels with the death in 2010 from circumcision wounds of 27-day-old Goodluck Caubergs of Chadderton, Oldham. In 2012, the woman who performed the baby's operation, Grace Adeyele, was convicted of manslaughter and given a 21-month suspended jail term. That same year, the British Association for Community Child Health reported on injuries caused by unlicensed circumcision practitioners in Bristol. These included a fractured skull caused by a baby falling off a kitchen table. The doctors' insurance association, the Medical Protection Society, warns that GPs who perform circumcisions outside of hospitals 'need to be aware that the procedure can carry considerable risks'. However, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) does not want to prevent unqualified people conducting circumcisions. As Dr Jonathan Botting, the RCGP's clinical lead for minor surgery, explains: 'I am not going to say that you should ban people who are not medically qualified from performing circumcisions, because they may be quite capable of performing what is a very simple procedure, but only if they are correctly trained, indemnified and if they operate in an environment that meets national infection control and health and safety standards. On top of this, their results must be audited and available for scrutiny.'","Medical experts are increasingly divided over male circumcision .

"The Seven Network's siege special, to be aired on Sunday night, will show the harrowing moment where gunman Man Monis raises his gun to shoot Lindt cafe manager Tori Johnson in the head. It's believed the vision does not, however, show the fatal discharge but Daily Mail Australia has been told that 'you hear the shot'. Seven will show 'Inside The Siege: The Untold Story' in the normal 6pm news slot on Sunday and it is expected to run at least 90 minutes. That means it will clash, at some point, with the Nine Network's 60 Minutes siege special, which is scheduled to start at 7pm. The Daily Mail has learned that in the next sequence, Monis can be clearly seen fumbling with his gun, after shooting Mr Johnson, trying to reload as police then storm the building. Scroll down for video . Gunman Man Haron Monis is seen during the Seven siege special taking two human shields to check a noise from the back of the building, as five hostages ran free in the early hours of December 16. The footage then shows him returning,  to execute Tori Johnson . Seven producers have been working with vision shot from three different cameras inside their newsroom for the special on Sunday night hosted by Melissa Doyle and Mark Ferguson . Police snipers took over the Seven newsroom after it was evacuated and the program on Sunday night will give viewers their perspective over the course of the near 17 hour stand-off . The Seven special will show the chilling moment gunman Man Monis raises his weapon to shoot Tori Johnson . Seven had three cameras locked on the Lindt cafe, providing producers more than 50 hours of vision sift through for Sunday night's special . Manager Tori Johnson is pictured at the opening of the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place . In the vision to be seen for the first time on Sunday, Monis is clearly seen walking with two human shields to investigate noises at the back of the building. That is the moment when five hostages run free and he forces the manager to kneel, then takes aim. An industry insider told DMA that 'they (Seven) will be able to illustrate the narrative of all the hostages' stories'. 'When the siege happened, they had it from the very start, they have the first cameras on the scene and almost from the word go there’s a record of what took place.' Seven's production team sifted through about 50 hours of vision from three different cameras which were trained on the Lindt cafe, across Martin Place from the network's newsroom. It's understood, one was focused wide, one was roaming and another which had a magnified lens, gave police sniper's a full-on close-up of Monis. 'They'll have every second of those 16 plus hours, it'll be difficult to know what to leave out.' It will be presented by Melissa Doyle, who undertook the interviews, along with Mark Ferguson. Network stars Melissa Doyle and Mark Ferguson will present Seven's special on Sunday 'Inside The Siege: The Untold Story' 60 Minutes will air its siege special at 7pm Sunday with eight survivors featured, including Joel Herat (pictured) who is seen in this image being forced to place the Islamic Shahada flag in the Lindt cafe window . Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson were remembered in countless tributes left at Martin Place in the days after their deaths inside the Lindt cafe . The special will also reveal how Monis had all the mobile phones collected and placed on a table. No one was allowed to have them 'for fear of death', except for the opportunity to contact loved ones and say goodbye and to record video messages, as ordered by the gunman. Monis held 18 hostages for almost 17 hours from 9.45am on Monday December 15, until police stormed the cafe just after 2.10am the next morning. As yet, no decision has been made by the Lindt company as to the future of the cafe in Martin Place. Marcia Mikhael was one of the first to agree to tell her story, reportedly rejecting a $300,000 offer from the Nine Network to be a part of the Seven special . Marcia Mikhael, 43, was one of the first to agree to an exclusive interview with Seven, which is thought to have paid between $350,000 and $400,000 for her story - after the Nine Network tabled at $300,000 offer which was rejected. She tells Doyle, the former Sunrise host, that Monis warned:  ""For every person that escapes I will shoot two"", that's when I lost hope. Then I asked them if I could call my kids and speak to them because I actually wanted to hear their voices for the last time.' A decision on the Lindt cafe's future in Martin Place is expected to be made soon . Both Channel Seven and Channel Nine have secured exclusive interviews with several of the survivors, with the cost for the networks believed to nudge $1 million. The networks were so desperate to snare the best stories for their head-to-head broadcasts, they were sending out their stars to 'door knock' the 16 survivors to convince them to tell-all. Seven will feature the stories of six survivors - Marcia Mikhael, John O'Brien, Viswakanth Ankireddy, Puspendu Ghosh, Elly Chen and Jieun Bae. 60 Minutes has announced its special will focus on the accounts of eight survivors, telling of their horror inside the cafe - Paolo Vassallo, Harriette Denny, Joel Herat, Jarrod Morton-Hoffman, Fiona Ma, Selina Win Pe and Louisa and Robin Hope. It's also been revealed that both networks are racing against the clock to have the specials finished, just five days out from going to air.","Seven's 50 plus hours of vision looking inside the Lindt Chocolate Cafe includes the moment Man Monis points his gun to shoot Tori Johnson .

"On-loan West Ham midfielder Alex Song has declared that West Ham can become one of English football's leading forces, and then Europe's, providing they follow Atletico Madrid's example. The Hammers are flying high domestically this season, with Sam Allardyce's side sitting sixth in the Premier League - one point behind Manchester United in fourth and the final position Champions League spot. And having joined the club on a season-long loan from Spanish giants Barcelona, the Camerooon international is adamant that the potential at the club means they can be challenging with the Premier League's established big sides within the next five to six years. Alex Song acknowledges the West Ham fans at his unveiling at the club after signing on loan from Barcelona . The 27-year-old cites the East London outfit's imminent move to London's Olympic stadium from their current Upton Park home in 2016 as a key reason, with the new venue playing a key part in being able to attract players to wanting to come and sign for the club. 'Maybe in the next five, six years one day West Ham will become one of the big clubs in England,' he said. 'I think that the way that things are going at the moment it's very good. 'For everyone who loves West Ham football club it's very, very important to look ahead because everyone is looking forward to moving into that [Olympic] Stadium and when we move it'll be unbelievable. 'I think then West Ham can look towards playing in Europe and then attracting more players to sign. 'I genuinely believe West Ham can be one of the biggest clubs in England. When I played in Spain nobody thought Atletico Madrid could be like they are but today everybody sees how good they are. Song, seen here competing with Manchester City's Jesus Navas, has proved to be a shrewd acquistion . 'West Ham just have to learn from their example and try to be the same team. I think the future is great, because of the new stadium. 'When we have a big stadium, new players will want to come especially with the way we're playing at the moment. 'If we've done very well at the end of the season, then more players will want to come. I just want to be happy, make the fans happy and just give them some happiness when they come to watch West Ham play every Saturday.' Song has played an integral part in the club's early-season form with his eight Premier League performances having endeared him to the East London faithful. The former Arsenal star added that he is happy in his new surroundings but won't comment on his future until the end of the season. Song, a former fans favourite at Arsenal, says West Ham can become one of the biggest clubs in England . 'I think my future at the moment is just to help the club. I'm very happy here, it's a privilege to be a West Ham player and I enjoy every day of that,' he said. 'The fans gave me a great welcome when I arrived and it's a family club. Every single day I come to training I have a big smile on my face with everyone and it's helped me settle on-the-pitch. 'I want to say thank you who has shown me goodwill. I just want to repay them back with my performances. 'But for now I don't know what's happening [about my future] other than that I just want to play, help the club and then we'll see at the end of the season.'","Alex Song has been an ever-present since joining West Ham on loan .

"The only bottle of Big Mac Special Sauce available to the public is up for grabs on eBay and is already sitting at $23,000 - and there is still another eight days of bidding to go. The first produced of just 200 500ml bottles of the McDonald's signature burger sauce has sparked a massive interest from Aussie Macca's fans with 135 bids growing to $23,100 in just two days. However with the auction running until February 11 - it begs the question: How much you would be prepared to spend to get your mitts on the much-loved condiment to take home and lather on any meal you fancy? Scroll down for video . The McDonald's signature burger sauce has sparked a massive interest from Aussie Macca's fans with 135 bids growing to more than $23,100 in just two days and eight days of bidding still to go . Only one 500ml bottle of the Big Mac Special Sauce is being auctioned off on eBay with money going to charity . The very tongue-in-cheek ad on eBay talks about setting the sauce free which makes it 'rarer than a spot on Bondi beach on New Years Day.' It goes on to say that any dish tastes better with the famous sauce including steak, your mum's lasagne, Chicken Caesar Salad and even Hungarian Goulash. 'Cupcakes, ice cream, macaroni jewellery, fish oil capsules. Don’t like brussel sprouts? You will now!' 'With 500ml to play with, you’ll have enough to impress your friends at dinner parties, cheat your way to cooking show fame, and get elected as Prime Minister!' If this all seems a bit too self-indulgent - 100 per cent of the sale goes to the Ronald McDonald House Charities. There is no need to panic if you don't have thousands of dollars in cash to spare to splash out on a bottle of sauce - as Australians are privvy to 25ml tubs throughout the month of February. But you will need to get in quick because each of the 920 Australian stores only have 600 25ml tubs on offer. Although the magic ingredients for the Big Mac sauce have never been a secret - it's the ratio to create distinct flavour that remains a mystery . Until now, the Big Mac sauce has only been delivered to McDonald’s outlets in sealed canisters and directly dispensed onto the burger using a specially calibrated ‘sauce gun’. Although the magic ingredients for the sauce have never been a secret - it's the ratio to create distinct flavour that remains a mystery. The sauce is made up of a blend of relish, mustard, onion and garlic, along with other ingredients, which gives it that distinctive sweet and sour taste. 'Big Mac sauce is one of the most iconic McDonald's ingredients and people often ask us where they can buy it; so we're excited to be the first country in the world to offer tubs of Big Mac sauce to our customers,' McDonald's Australia, Chief Marketing Officer Mark Lollback said. 'I know of people who love adding our special sauce to all types of food – from french fries to McNuggets – so it's going to be interesting to see what Aussies choose to add a spot of Big Mac sauce to over the next month.' The ingredients that make up the Big Mac are the same today as when the burger was first created 40 years ago – two all beef patties, Special Sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun . Each 920 of the McDonald's stores throughout Australia have 600 25ml tubs available until sold out . The first chance Aussies will have to get their hands on some Big Mac sauce is through an eBay auction of an exclusive 500ml bottle that kicked off last night, with proceeds going to Ronald McDonald House Charities. The bottle is one of only 200 produced in the world with the remaining 199 not available for purchase. 'We're excited to be auctioning off the first-ever bottle of Big Mac sauce for a cause we are passionate about,' Mr Lollback said. 'It's going to be interesting to see just how much people are prepared to pay for such a sought after commodity.'

"Face cream made from human blood has emerged as the latest craze in celebrity skincare . Want to know the secret to youthful skin? It seems the answer could be in your DNA. Face cream made from human blood has emerged as the latest craze in celebrity skincare. Used by various celebrities, each £950 tub of the 'MC1' cream is made using proteins and growth factors found in blood. And it claims to reduce the signs of ageing by building collagen, shrinking pores and increasing the healing power of cells in the skin, as well as helping to clear up conditions such as psoriasis. The cream, which has been created by cosmetic doctor Barbara Sturm, was developed in Germany and is now being made available in the UK for the first time, at London's Dorchester hotel. It contains proteins, which have healing properties, which are extracted from the client's own blood. And Dr Sturm, whose celebrity clients include The Nutty Professor actress Jada Pinkett Smith and Being John Malkovich star John Cusack, said it is 'the future' for skin treatment. Once known for dating actor George Hamilton, Dr Sturm said there is a demand for the cream among people 'whose face is their business'. And she said: 'The results are spectacular and immediate. My 'MC1' cream takes the inflammation out of your skin, shrinks the pores, builds collagen, and creates a radiant and healthy 'glow' to each patient's skin. It has also been effective in reducing dermatitis, psoriasis and acne, and in speeding wound healing.' Each pot is of Dr Sturm's cream is tailor made using a blood sample taken from a client when they check in at the Dorchester, which is popular with stars including Kate Moss, Gwyneth Paltrow, Elle Macpherson and Sienna Miller. It is processed through a special syringe and incubated at 37ºC for about four to six hours, which increases the production of proteins and growth factors. These are then separated and extracted from the blood and added to a pot of Dr Sturm's cream. And clients receive their 50ml tub of the cream the following day, while Dr Sturm keeps a vial of frozen blood for future use. The cream, which has been created by cosmetic doctor Barbara Sturm (pictured), was developed in Germany and is now being made available in the UK for the first time, at London's Dorchester hotel . Dr Sturm, who is a former orthopaedic surgeon, now travels the world to treat her a-list clients' skin complaints. She claimed bespoke treatments like hers are the most effective way of treating the skin, adding: 'Since over the counter products are typically full of marketing rather than medical ideas, and aggressive ingredients like fragrance, parabens, and mineral oils, I believe effective bespoke treatments will be the wave of the future. People whose face is their business have to take the best care of it.' Dr Sturm has already established herself among the well-healed by offering her spa treatments at the exclusive Hotel Aurelio ski chalet in Austria. There, guests can wind down after a day on the slopes with a facial. Dr Sturm's products are also sold on Net-A-Porter. However 'MC1' cream is only available at The Dorchester. 1. A blood sample is taken from the client upon arrival at the Dorchester Hotel. 2. The sample is incubated 37ºC for about four to six hours, during which time it begins producing proteins and healing growth factors. 3. Proteins are separated and extracted from the blood sample using a special syringe and put into Dr Sturm' base cream. 4. The following day a 50ml pot of the bespoke cream is delivered to the client for use. 5. A vial of the blood sample is frozen and retained by Dr Sturm so more pots of the cream can be made in the future.","Face cream made from human blood is latest craze in celebrity skincare .

"Sitting happily in the saddle, nine-year-old Daisy Pritchard looks a picture of poise. But the confident young rider has far more to thank her pony for than a bracing trot in the winter sunshine. After she suffered a stroke during a heart operation at 21 months, doctors warned Daisy would never walk or talk again. Nine-year-old Daisy Pritchard sitting on top of her horse Dollar, which has helped her to walk again after suffering from a stroke . Daisy has built a remarkable bond with Dollar, pictured, and is making a good recovery after being told she would never walk or talk again . Yet thanks to the remarkable bond she has forged with Dollar the pony, she is making an extraordinary recovery. It began when Dollar, who belongs to her mother, sauntered over to the little girl, who was in her wheelchair on a trip to the stables when she was nearly three. Daisy’s mother Eileen, 44, said: ‘There was a flicker of recognition between the two of them. Then Daisy turned her head towards his and Dollar put his ears back as if to say, “I’m here”. 'It was the first time since the stroke Daisy had moved her head and in that moment I saw a spark of the child I’d lost.’ After eight months Mrs Pritchard began holding Daisy up on Dollar’s saddle as she’d sometimes done on visits to the stable before she became ill. Daisy had been undergoing physiotherapy for her back, which was twisted after the stroke left her right side paralysed. She disliked the repetitive exercises, but riding 24-year-old Dollar – holding the reins with her left hand – proved to be the perfect therapy. By the age of five, her back muscles were strong enough to allow her to walk short distances. Daisy's mother Eileen took her daughter when she was still in her wheelchair to the stables with her and that's when she struck up a bond with the horse . Mrs Pritchard, from Wrexham, Wales, gave birth to Daisy in 2006 after she and husband David, a company director, had several rounds of IVF. She has four older children from a previous relationship. Tests in 2008 revealed Daisy had only three heart chambers instead of the normal four and needed an operation to reposition her arteries. The first surgery went wrong and she was rushed back for a second operation, during which she had the stroke. Her mother said: ‘When Daisy had gone into theatre she’d been a beautiful, blonde, chatty toddler who was running around. Now she was just lying there helpless.’ Daisy aged nine months sitting on top of a pony before suffering a stroke . Since learning to ride, Daisy has come on in leaps and bounds – walking, talking and attending mainstream school – although she still uses a scooter or wheelchair to help her get around outside the house. She can ride without any assistance and has even developed a special way of communicating with Dollar, tapping either side of his neck to ask him to turn. Mrs Pritchard, who is now separated from her husband, said: ‘Without Dollar in her life I don’t believe Daisy would have ever recovered. He became her legs, her reason to get up and walk. ‘It might sound strange to say about a horse, but I will always be so grateful to Dollar ... I thought I’d lost my beautiful daughter but his healing has brought her back. ‘With other people Dollar can be quite boisterous. But when Daisy is riding him he purposely takes smaller steps. He is devoted, ensuring she’s steady on him. ‘When Daisy rides Dollar onlookers have no idea at all she is paralysed down her right side, unable to use her right arm and leg.’ Daisy and Dollar have developed a special way of communicating with Daisy tapping Dollar either side of his neck to turn. Although Daisy still has to use a scooter or wheelchair for walking outside the house, on Dollar she is so stable she can ride herself. Mrs Pritchard said: ‘These days Daisy and I go riding together, with her on Dollar. It might sound strange to say about a horse, but I will always be so grateful to Dollar. ‘For a long time I thought I’d lost my beautiful daughter but his healing has brought her back.’","Daisy Pritchard, 9, suffered a stroke aged 21 months during heart surgery .

"A new KFC store will open its doors in Sydney on Tuesday, however customers are sure to find it a little different to their usual fast food experience. Boasting a specialised menu and a whole host of new ingredients, the spealised eatery - located on Church Street in Parramatta in the western suburbs - is the first of its kind in Australia. Burgers, wraps and bowls filled with red quinoa, jalapeno sauces, basmati rice and corn salsa are just some of the new options hungry customers can snap up at the restaurant. KFC will open a brand new concept store on Tuesday in Sydney's western suburbs . Located on Church Street, Paramatta, the restaurant will feature a custom menu with new items on it . Red quinoa, jalapeno sauces, basmati rice and corn salsa are just some of the new ingredients available . Fitted with wood highlighting, new imagery and a fresh design the store has also applied for a permit to serve a small selection of beer and cider to its diners. The application for a liquor license is currently under review at the Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing. If approved customers will be able to purchase one alcoholic drink per meal, but there is no move to introduce alcohol into any existing stores. Nikki Lawson, Chief Marketing and Development Officer for KFC Australia, said she was excited to bring an entirely new kind of concept to Parramatta locals and Sydney-siders. A selection of burgers, wraps and bowls (pictured) are sold at the Australian-first store . The store has applied for a permit to serve a small selection of beer and cider to its diners . If approved customers will be able to purchase one alcoholic drink per meal . The application for a liquor license is currently under review and it could be the only KFC store in Australia to serve alcohol . Favourites - All $7 . Burgers, Wraps & Bowls - All $10 . Sides - $3-4 . Frozen Custard - $3/Scoop . 'Our existing KFC menu is designed to appeal to the broad Australian population - in some locations, such as our Church Street store, where the customer base is predominantly working adult Australians, we wanted to trial a smaller menu more targeted to their needs,' Ms Lawson said. 'For this reason we have reduced the menu to some core favourites and added a few additional items that we believe will hold appeal to this audience.

"French counter-terrorism experts have identified 64 suburbs in dozens of cities that act as breeding grounds for Islamic extremism. So-called 'ghettos' with high rates of youth unemployment, immigration and single-parent families, such as L'Ariane near Nice, have been linked to the radicalisation of young and vulnerable people. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls last month admitted that the country had collapsed into social and ethnic 'apartheid' - the first time a senior politician has conceded that economic marginalisation and religious tensions have led to serious divides. Until 17 people were killed in January's shocking Charlie Hebdo terror attacks, the French government remained largely consistent in its claim that overriding 'Frenchness' was a  unifying factor more powerful than loyalties to local communities or religious belief. Tragic: Until 17 people were killed in January's shocking Charlie Hebdo terror attacks, the French government remained largely consistent in its claim that overriding 'Frenchness' was a unifying factor in the country . Extremists: Brothers Said (left) and Cherif Kouachi (right), who killed 12 people in an attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine offices in central Paris. The pair then died following a siege . In total 64 French suburbs have been identified as breeding grounds for extremism, each of them sharing startling similar characteristics, according to Sky News. Unemployment, for example, is on average 23 per cent in the suburbs, rising to a staggering 45 per cent among the young. Up to half of all families in the 64 suburbs also have just one parent. For those lucky enough to have work, the average income is just €11,000 (£8,300) a year, leaving many with barely enough money to survive. As many as 50 per cent of those living in the suburbs are also first generation immigrants or their children, many of them having travelled to France from war-torn nations. Such patterns of have now proved to the French leadership that vast swathes of the population are falling behind economically, resulting in   ghettoised suburbs where mental and social attachment to France as a nation holds little sway, and where criminal and religious leaders often wield power. Militants: The French government believes that around 400 French citizens have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight alongside militants from the Islamic State terror group (pictured) Claim: French Prime Minister Manuel Valls (pictured) last month admitted that the country had collapsed into social and ethnic 'apartheid' As well as identifying 64 suburbs as having the potential to push the young and vulnerable towards extremism, the French interior ministry has also designated 15 Priority Security Zones in areas already considered hotbeds of crime - with radical Islamism and jihadism chief among them. Speaking to Sky News, Colonel Gael Marchand, head of the Gendarmerie in Alpes-Maritime, said: 'There is a very blurred and small gap between organised crime and terrorism.' 'Terrorists need funding and they are often recruited in prisons. If you're a terrorist and a former criminal you know where and how to get weapons,' he added. He added that weapons, including guns, are easy to come by in these 15 areas, as each of them extensive links to mafia smuggling routes from Italy and eastern Europe. The 15 areas, which have not been identified, have already been reinforced by  undercover investigators and uniformed officers, with rapid response road blocks and random weapon and drugs checks now in force in an effort to reduce the rate of criminality. Tribute: Millions marched through Paris in the days that followed the attack as they showed their support for freedom of speech and the Charlie Hebdo staff . Je Suis Charlie: The satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo was targeted by Islamic terrorists because of it frequently published cartoons about the religion. 17 people died over three bloody days last month . The French government has been ridiculed for producing a poster to help identify potential jihadists - with one suggestion that giving up baguettes is a telltale sign. They claim pointers that someone is being radicalised by Islamist fanatics include alarm bells such as losing interest in sports, rejecting family members and changing eating habits. The poster was launched as part of a new £320million campaign to counter terrorism in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks. But the attempt to inform the public backfired, with many ridiculing the Stop Jihadism poster for the suggestions it made. News of the terrorism breeding grounds being identified comes as French police arrested eight men suspected of recruiting fighters for Islamist militants in Syria. The arrests in the Paris and Lyon areas are not linked to the Charlie Hebdo attacks, Interior Minister Barnard Cazeneuve told local media. The French government believes that around 400 French citizens have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight alongside militants from the Islamic State terror group. There are also approximately 900 Islamic extremists still in France with links to recruitment cells. Mr Cazeneuve said 161 terror-related legal proceedings were in progress, with 547 individuals suspected of involvement in terror networks. The majority of these relate to the funding and recruitment for terrorist groups, rather than the plotting of terror attacks themselves.","Counter-terror experts identify 64 French suburbs linked to radicalisation .

Raul Castro, the longtime armed forces chief, took his brother's place at Cuba's helm. The Granma article said that the meeting between Castro and the student leader came four days before Castro finally broke his silence on the diplomatic breakthrough with the US. It added that, although he was wary of his old enemy Washington, he did not oppose it and viewed the historic change as a 'positive step'.

Last week the communist leader met with a Brazilian theologian, Frei Betto, who advocates liberation theology - the idea that it is the Catholic church's responsibility to help the poor. 'The commander is in good health and in good spirits,' Betto said the next day. But no photos of the meeting were published. Castro took notes on what Betto said, according to the Brazilian. Betto said he found the former Cuban leader 'in good health, thin but lucid.' Speaking last week Castro appeared to lend his support to talks with the U.S. but stopped short of an enthusiastic endorsement of the move. 'I don't trust the policy of the United States nor have I had an exchange with them, but this does not mean ... a rejection of a peaceful solution to conflicts or the dangers of war,' Fidel Castro said in a statement published on the website of Granma.

'We will always defend cooperation and friendship with all the peoples of the world, among them our political adversaries.' He took power in a 1959 revolution and spent much of his 49 years in power railing against the United States, which never succeeded in many attempts to oust him. In mid-January Castro sent a letter to Argentina football legend Diego Maradona - a friend of his - and this also eased fears that he was on his last legs.

"Manchester United star Angel di Maria's traumatised wife has told her husband she's unwilling to return to their family home after thugs attempted to smash their way into the house using scaffold poles. Jorgelina Cardoso has told di Maria, 26, she never wants to return to their family home in Cheshire after she was left shaken and traumatised by the terrifying raid on Saturday night. The couple, along with their one-year-old daughter Mia, were at home eating dinner when the gang of three tried to break through patio doors just hours after Manchester United's victory over Leicester City. The family have been staying at the Lowry Hotel in Manchester following the harrowing ordeal. Here the couple are pictured giving their daughter Mia a kiss at Christmas time .

A window at di Maria's Cheshire home was yesterday boarded up after the burglars attempted to break into the property using scaffold poles . Footballer Angel di Maria pictured in action against Leicester City on Saturday just hours before the terrifying attempted break in at his family home . On Sunday Manchester United placed security guards at their house, while photographs of the property showed a window was boarded up. The couple were whisked to the Lowry Hotel in Manchester after the attack and remain staying there in a bid to ease Mrs Cardoso's concerns,The Sun reported. A source told the paper: 'Angel's wife is completely freaked out. 'She has told Angel that she never wants to go back. She may calm down in time but she is very family oriented so she has been really shaken by what happened.' The former Real Madrid winger was shadowed by a security guard on Sunday as he drove from his hotel in his Range Rover. Di Maria's agent confirmed the incident on Sunday and Cheshire police are investigating reports of a burglary. 'At 7.30pm on Saturday, January 31, police received reports of a burglary at a house in Prestbury,' a spokesman told MailOnline. The family are staying at Manchester's Lowry Hotel (pictured) and Jorgelina is said to be too scared to return home . Police said the offenders tried to enter the player's Cheshire home by smashing a back door. Here the couple are pictured at the Manchester United Christmas party last year . The footballer, pictured with his wife, put his success with Real Madrid last season down to the lessons he has learned from his baby daughter . 'A number of offenders tried to gain access to the property by trying to smash the back door. 'The alarm was raised before the men got inside and they fled the scene.' The Argentina international signed for Manchester United from Real Madrid in August for a British record transfer fee of £59.7million, moving to Cheshire with his wife, who he married in 2011, and daughter, who is almost 22-months-old. Due to its proximity to both Manchester and Liverpool, Cheshire is popular with Premier League footballers and several players' homes have been targeted by burglars in the past. Everton and England defender Phil Jagielka was robbed at knifepoint at his home near Knutsford in 2009. Stoke striker Peter Crouch suffered two break-ins, in 2011 and 2006, at two properties he's owned in Cheshire. United star Darren Fletcher's wife and mother were threatened with a knife when raiders burst into their home in Bowdon in 2009.

Little Mia was born three months premature on April 22, 2013. He and his wife have backed charity Unicef's campaign to raise awareness of premature babies . And the wife of Bolton striker Emile Heskey was also held at knifepoint when a gang raided their mansion in Hale during his time with Wigan Athletic in 2008. The series of raids led to claims that top footballers were installing panic rooms in their homes. Di Maria's daughter Mia was born three months premature on April 22, 2013 - the night before her father's then team Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in a Champions League semi-final. Di Maria missed the game to be with his wife and their baby spent the next two months in intensive care before the couple were allowed to take her home. The footballer has previously said of his little girl: ‘My daughter taught me that everything that appears to be really difficult can end up being easy if you put the effort in and wait for the rewards. ‘She transmitted so much energy to me and it helped me to have the spectacular year that I had.’ Di Maria’s wife had suffered pregnancy complications and doctors had given the couple’s baby a 30 per cent chance of survival if the birth was not induced .","Angel di Maria's wife left terrified after attempted break in at family home .

"A police investigation has been launched after a 12-year-old schoolgirl discovered classmates sharing an indecent photograph of her online. The case has raised fears that more children are being coaxed into sharing compromising pictures which are then distributed without their knowledge. Officers have urged other potential victims to come forward in a bid to crack down on the abusive practice. The girl's mother said that her daughter, who is now 13, had sent a picture of her cleavage to a male friend. Sharing: St Kentigern's Academy is one of three schools in Blackburn, West Lothian where indecent photographs of schoolgirls have been shared among pupils . But she was then included in a Facebook conversation which saw her photograph shared with other classmates, along with other compromising pictures of young girls. She immediately quit the thread of messages, but the pictures are believed to have been shared among pupils at three schools in Blackburn, West Lothian - Armadale Academy, Bathgate Academy and St Kentigern's High. Her mother said: 'My daughter feels very embarrassed and shocked. This shouldn't be happening. It's across the schools in West Lothian. The officer I spoke to said the more people he spoke to, the more he heard about it happening.' She added that friends of her daughter had also been persuaded to send topless or nude pictures to boys they knew, and called for school authorities to do more to safeguard pupils. 'The parents should be made aware of this,' she said. '[The schools] have known about this for months.' Schools: Pupils at Bathgate Academy, left, and Armadale Academy, right, have also been sharing the photos . Police Scotland confirmed that they had received a formal complaint about the abusive behaviour in November last year, and called for other children affected by the issue to speak to them. A spokesman said: 'Police in West Lothian are investigating following allegations that indecent images of a 13-year-old girl were shared on social media. 'Inquiries are ongoing and we urge any other victims to come forward. 'Tackling the creation and sharing of indecent images is a priority for Police Scotland, with all complaints received thoroughly investigated. 'We provide specialist support to victims and target offenders to bring them to justice.' A West Lothian Council spokesman added: 'We take the online safety of our pupils very seriously and are currently working closely with police on this matter.

"A stunning photograph captures the moment a striped marlin spotted its lunch and went straight for the kill - spearing a helpless sardine with its huge, needle-like snout. Swimming in the waters off Mexico's Baja California peninsula, the carnivorous fish attacked a large shoal, forcing them to scatter and leaving a handful of weaker sardines isolated and vulnerable. It was then able to swoop again, using its spear-like snout to puncture a hole in the side of a prone sardine at a speed of 50mph, before using its small, file-like teeth to finish off the dying fish. The incredible underwater photographs were taken by American wildlife photographer Doug Perrine, who was free diving off the Mexican coast when he spotted the striped marlin hunting.

Speared: This stunning photograph captures the moment a striped marlin spotted its lunch and went straight for the kill - spearing a helpless sardine with its huge, needle-like snout . Charge: Swimming in the waters off Mexico's Baja California peninsula, the carnivorous fish attacked a large shoal, forcing them to scatter and leaving a handful of weaker sardines isolated and vulnerable . Hunting: With the sardines scattering, the marlin was then able swoop on the shoal again, using its spear-like snout to puncture a hole in the side of a prone sardine at a speed of 50mph . Mr Perrine, 62, lives in Kailua Kona, Hawaii and is one of very few people to have taken a photograph of a striped marlin hunting sardines in its natural environment. Describing the experience he said: 'The striped marlins have broken these sardines off from a giant shoal deep below, and forced them upwards to trap them against the surface of the water.' 'Then they break the school apart, charging through it and first picking off the weakest fish or the ones that get confused and don't move with the rest of the bait,' he added. 'The striped marlins sometimes strike the fish with their bills, using a slashing motion, to injure them before swallowing them. Other times they just swallow them directly,' Mr Perrine went on to say. ''They rarely impale a sardine on their bill, however I was lucky enough to capture this,' he added. Striped: The incredible underwater photographs were taken by American wildlife photographer Doug Perrine, who was free diving off the Mexican coast when he spotted the marlin hunting . In the deep: Doug Perrine was free diving five metres below the water when he saw the marlin reach speeds of up to 50mph, charging the sardine shoal and forcing them to scatter . Striped marlins are rarely seen, and very rarely photographed underwater in their natural habitat. However, free diving five metres below the water, Mr Perrine was able to watch as the fish reached speeds of up to 50mph, charging the sardine shoal and forcing them to scatter. With most photographs taken at a distance of around three metres from the fish, he was lucky enough to touch the marlins at times. 'Most people ask how it was possible for me to capture these photographs...Some ask if they are paintings, or were created with computer wizardry,' Mr Perrine said. 'I wanted to show the beauty of these magnificent apex predators to the 99.999 per cent of people who will never themselves see a free-swimming marlin underwater,' he added.

"In order to help end the age-old battle between men and women over the position of the toilet seat, scientists have turned to mathematical models to reveal the upsides and downsides to the 'always leave it down' rule favored by women. These thinkers, both men, each looked at the problem in different ways: one sought to determine the best way to equalize the lifting and dropping efforts of both men and women in a particular household while the other set out to uncover a method of minimizing the number of times the seat is moved. Both their conclusions would reduce the frequency of men having to move the seat, Vox found. What's your strategy? A simulation posted to Reddit by user JeffSergeant reveals the most efficient ways to go about lifting and lowering the toilet seat in a household with a man and a woman. As Jay Pil Choi found, the most efficient strategy is to leave it how you used it . For Michigan State University professor of economics Jay Pil Choi, the goal was to minimize the number of times a household's toilet is moved. Choi's analysis found that-- in the straightforward scenario where a man an woman alternate their use of the toilet--the best way to minimize effort is to simply leave the seat in the position you've used it. The man will have to lift the seat each time he urinates but not when he defecates and the woman will have to lower it each time she urinates, but not if the man has defecated before her. Because no one will have to move the seat more than once per bathroom visit, effort will be minimized. So, what if your goal is to make equitable the amount of effort a man and woman must exert? Writer Richard Harter has answered that quandary in a paper published in Science Creative Quarterly called 'A Game Theoretic Approach to the Toilet Seat Problem.' In his scenario, Harter found--using cold, hard math--that the effort is roughly equaled when the woman leaves the seat where she found it and the man puts it down about half the time after urinating and in the evening 'to avoid the notorious ""middle of the night surprise.""' 'I expect that this analysis should settle the toilet seat controversey for once and for all – if John and Marsha are mathematicians,' Harter writes. Another toilet strategy tinkerer, Reddit user JeffSergeant created a chart that examines these and other strategies and shows the breakdown of how each gender is affected. His calculations mirror Choi's, but also reveal the least efficient toilet seat method would be for everyone to leave it up, followed by flipping a coin and then the female favorite of everyone leaving it down. To lower or not to lower? That is the question posed by mathematical thinkers who found that always always leaving the restroom with the toilet seat down is an inefficient strategy .","Some male thinkers seeking to prove the 'always put it down' rule wrong have found some reasons men should start leaving it up .

"As if being watched by a bar full of drinkers having sex with a company secretary wasn't bad enough, the wife of the senior insurance manager caught in the sex romp then found out about the man's extramarital affair on Facebook. It's just the latest twist in a sex scandal that has become a social media sensation. The married man, understood to have children, has still not shown his face at insurance firm Marsh Ltd in Christchurch as bosses conduct an employment investigation.

The young couple get to know each other in the Marsh Ltd offices in Christchurch . The sexual antics of the man and the young woman were caught on camera last Friday night after pub patrons across the road noticed the amorous couple had left the lights on and the action was posted online immediately.

She's in pieces and can't even speak to him,' a source said. The mood at the Christchurch branch is said to be 'rather tense'.

It comes after the romp caught the eye of revellers at the Carlton Bar and Eatery across the street, who then posted images on Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. The incident provoked a huge reaction with one witness saying that because it went on for 'a good half hour', patrons in the bar 'started to get bored and drift off back to the dance floor'. The couple had gone into the office after it had closed thinking they'd get some privacy when they were actually being watched by patrons across the road at the Carlton Bar and Eatery . Before long the pair start to undress in the office unaware that they were being watched . The couple even enjoyed a glass of wine as they enjoyed their own private party . Customers across the road at the Carlton Bar and Eatery got a front-row seat for the show . ‘The entire bar united in cheering them on,’ said one person on social network Reddit. ‘It started with a casual flirt. Then the kiss, grabbing the attention of all. Get it, son! Finally they moved to the back of them room, thinking they were unseen. Off comes the tights, down goes his head. By this stage, 50 bar patrons were pressed up against the window yelling their approval. ‘To be honest, after watching them f*** for a good half hour, people started to get bored and drift off back to the dancefloor.’ However, it got so steamy at one stage that the band even stopped playing in the bar. But when calm was restored the cheeky musicians started up again with Kings of Leon song, Sex on Fire. 'The band had to delay playing because the customers felt the need to support this view. Props to them for their next song being Sex on Fire,' one Reddit user said. Rabobank’s branding was also in many pictures on social media, only because it had naming rights to the building. Not that they escaped ridicule either. ‘Congrats to the man who made a deposit at Rabobank this evening,’ one Twitter follower posted. One Reddit user said: 'I guess it's not a bank for money.' While another also quipped on Reddit: 'When he withdrew he lost interest!' Twitter user Nick can't help making a quip about the couple and their antics . It got so steamy that the band even stop playing in the Carlton Bar and Eatery as the action continued . The Privacy Commissioner John Edwards told Radio New Zealand that there was little the sexy pair could do legally following some local backlash against those who filmed the incident in the bar. Several commentators in New Zealand claimed that the couple's privacy had been breached, but Mr Edwards said it was unlikely the police could take action if a complaint was made. ‘The people who were watching, we may criticise them for a lapse of decency in taking advantage of that, but it is unlikely there'd be any legal liability for their action,’ he said. Privacy lawyer Kathryn Dalziel also told Radio New Zealand even though the couple did not give their consent for the images to be taken, they would have to show their privacy had been breached to make a successful case under the Crimes Act. Revellers at the Carlton Bar and Eatery posted images on Facebook and Twitter of the couple . Marsh Ltd said they still had not made any decision on whether the couple would get the sack or face any disciplinary action. ‘We are not giving any further comment other than what has already been provided. We’re dealing with the matter internally that’s all we can say,' a spokeswoman for Marsh Ltd told Daily Mail Australia. 'It’s unknown what will happen to those involved at this stage, and what final decision will be made by the firm.’","The man's wife was reportedly distraught over the incident after discovering the affair on Facebook .

"A woman accused of killing her 5-year-old son by feeding him salt through a stomach tube calmly 'watched and waited' for the poisoning to take effect, summoning help only after he began writhing and retching, a prosecutor said on Tuesday. In her opening statement at the murder trial of Lacey Spears, Assistant District Attorney Doreen Lloyd said she researched, planned, carried out and tried to cover up the killing of her blond, blue-eyed son, Garnett-Paul. 'It seems to go against nature,' the prosecutor said. 'But Lacey Spears is not like most people.' She said Spears enjoyed the 'attention and sympathy' she received from having a sick child. Lacey Spears wiped away a tear as she was accused of researching, planning, carrying out and trying to cover up the killing of her blond, blue-eyed son, Garnett-Paul in White Plains, New York, a year ago . Spears, of Scottsville, Kentucky, had documented Garnett's declining health on social media. She wiped away a tear as the prosecutor spoke. Defense lawyer Stephen Riebling told the jurors there are no eyewitnesses and no direct evidence that the 27-year-old Spears poisoned her son. He added: 'There is no evidence in this case that legitimately answers the question ""Why?''' Lloyd alleged that Spears fed her son the salt in the bathroom of a Nyack Hospital room after he was admitted. The mother had told doctors he was having seizures. Lloyd told jurors they would see hospital video showing mother and son twice going into the bathroom and then see Garnett become ill soon afterward both times. He died of high sodium levels that caused swelling of the brain. But the bathroom is out of the range of the camera, and Riebling noted that no one saw Spears feed her son salt. Defendant Lacey Spears brushes her hair back during the opening statements portion of her murder trial at the Westchester County Courthouse in White Plains, N.Y., on Tuesday . Spears is accused of killing her 5-year-old son Garnett by feeding him salt through a stomach tube and then calmly 'watched and waited' for the poisoning to take effect, a prosecutor said on Tuesday . He said, in context, Spears' actions show a caring mother. He implored the jurors to 'set aside emotion.' Riebling also appeared to blame the hospital, in the New York suburbs near the Spearses' Chestnut Ridge home, noting it was only there that a high sodium level was detected. The defense lawyer said the prosecution case was 'riddled with reasonable doubt.' The Spearses lived in Chestnut Ridge at the time of Garnett's death. Lacey Spears moved to Kentucky afterward and was living there when she was arrested. Garnett's death ended a short life filled with doctor and hospital visits that his mother tirelessly documented in thousands of postings on Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and a blog. Spears is alleged to have fed salt to her son in the bathroom of a Nyack Hospital room after he was admitted . Many of the postings will be used in evidence, along with Spears' online research into the dangers of sodium in children and hospital records from New York, Florida and Spears' native Alabama. Also in evidence is a feeding bag prosecutors believe was used to hold the salt — and which they say she tried to hide after Garnett's death. Defense attorneys have insisted that there will be no mention of Munchausen by proxy, a disorder in which caretakers secretly harm children to win sympathy. Some experts believe that disorder fits Spears' actions.","Lacey Spears only summoned help after her five-year-old son Garnett began writhing and retching after she fed him salt, said a White Plains prosecutor .

"Actor Randy Quaid has unleashed a graphic attack on Rupert Murdoch who 'still hasn't thanked' him for starring in the 1996 movie Independence Day. In an explicit video, Quaid's wife Evgina sits on the bed in a bikini while the 64-year-old actor, who is sporting a long white beard, launches a diatribe against Warner Bros and News Corp. It concludes with former model Evi donning a Rupert Murdoch mask before Quaid simulates sex with her while she wears a Murdoch mask. Meltdown: Randy and Evgina Quaid, who are currently suing John Kerry and believe a Hollywood sect wants them dead, have posted a bizarre video on YouTube attacking various media corporations . Attack: In 'retaliation', he produces a mask of the media mogul who owns the firm News Corporation . 'You wanna f*** me Rupert? Well, I'm gonna f*** you. Evi, put this on,' Quaid says to the camera before performing the graphic act. The two-minute YouTube clip is the latest in a series of outbursts from the pair, who have openly expressed their belief that an evil Hollywood sect named 'Star Whackers' wants to kill them. Quaid, who has a star on the Hollywood walk of fame, is the older brother of actor Dennis Quaid and is slated to reprise his role in the next Independence Day movie. It would be his first role in at least five years. Currently, he and his wife are suing US Secretary of State John Kerry to recover their passports which were revoked three years ago after they failed to appear in court for charges of vandalism, fleeing to Canada instead. The couple's controversies started in 2008, when Quaid was banned from the Actor's Equity union for life and fined $81,572 after a stage production of Lone Star Love in Seattle. According to statements filed by the cast and crew, Quaid's physically and verbally abused his fellow performers, forcing the show to close. Four members of the union then filed restraining orders against Evi, Quaid's wife of 25 years, after an altercation the next day. In 2010, the Quaids were arrested and charged with vandalism and residential burglary - both felonies - after being found living illegally in the guest house of a Montecito, California property they once owned. In his hey day: Quaid, 64, played a starring role in the hit 1994 movie Independence Day with Will Smith . Christmas Vacation: Quaid claims he earned Warner Bros 'a billion dollars' with his role in this 2003 movie . Star on the Walk of Fame: After a Golden Globe nomination and Oscar nomination, Quaid earned his star . They had allegedly caused thousands of dollars of damage, including breaking a $7,000 mirror and replacing it with a photograph of themselves. The couple claimed 'they had owned the property since the 1990s' but were arrested and given court dates. However, the pair jumped bail, skipped court, and relocated north of the U.S. border. In Quaid's new video, uploaded to YouTube last Thursday, he tells viewers he 'helped media giants News Corp and Warner Bros Entertainment earn well over a billion dollars for the films Independence Day and Christmas Vacation'. But, he says, 'Evi and I have been put through a living hell. A living hell of biblical proportions.' He accuses Warner Bros Entertainment of conspiring with news outlet TMZ and the police to have him and his wife arrested six times, adding: 'Hash tag PMC: Police Media Corruption.' Also targeted is Warners Bros financial partner Bruce Berman, whom he accuses of stealing their house. Troubles: Mr and Mrs Quaid are wanted in California for charges of vandalism and residential burglary brought in 2010 but the pair fled to Canada before their first trial, prompting the US to revoke their passports . Arrested: In 2008 he was expelled from the Actor's Equity union, in 2010 he and wife Evi were arrested . And News Corporation, headed by Rupert Murdoch, 'continues to smear me to high heaven with a pack of lies' in the New York Post, he said. Finally, in a bizarre conclusion, Quaid muses: 'So how do we retaliate? Well, I still have a few tricks too.' He opens his blazer to show a Hawaiian shirt: 'This is the very same shirt that I wore in '94 when I saved the world [in Independence Day] - another act that Rupert Murdoch still hasn't thanked me for. 'So Rupert, you wanna f*** me? I'm gonna f*** you. Evi, put this on.' With Evi bent over the camera, Quaid stands behind and appears to have sex with her. Laughing over her shoulder, Quaid shouts 'Together Rupert!' repeatedly before screaming his Independence Day catchphrase: 'I'M BAAACK!' $500,000 bench warrants are still in effect for the couple in Santa Barbara. Bizarre: Quaid says he is wearing his shirt from Independence Day which Murdoch 'still hasn't thanked me for' Graphic: Quaid appears to have sex with his wife as she wears the mask in an apparent attack on Murdoch . The Quaids told authorities that their friends including Heath Ledger and David Carradine had died under 'mysterious circumstances' and were in fact killed by the 'Star Whackers' sect. Quaid withdrew his refugee claim last summer and immigration authorities have since denied his resubmittal. Randy Quaid is the older brother of actor Dennis Quaid. He is best-known for his roles in films such as National Lampoon's Vacation and Independence Day. He won a Golden Globe award - which he brought to court during one of his appearances in the innkeeper case - for his depiction of President Lyndon Johnson in a TV movie in the late 1980s. He was also nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar in 1973 for his role in The Last Detail. Quaid has a 31-year-old daughter, Amanda Quaid, with his first wife, Ella Marie Jolly, whom he divorced in August 1989. He married Evi six weeks later and they have no children together.","Quaid and wife Evgina believe a Hollywood sect named 'Star Whackers' killed Heath Ledger and David Carradine and now wants them dead .

"A judicial review application submitted by Australian convicted drug traffickers Andrew Chan and Myruan Sukumaran could lead to a window of opportunity for the pair who have been sentenced to execution. Despite the Indonesian Attorney General's former claims that the appeal would be rejected on Tuesday due to there being only one exhausted entitlement for judicial review, the Denpasar District Court chief, Judge Sugeng Riyono, is yet to make a decision on the matter. 'There is no difficulty. We just have to look at all the regulations, including the Constitutional Court decision, the Supreme Court decree as well as the joint decision that was made in January,' Mr Riyono said on Tuesday, rather than dismissing the appeal, News Corp reports. Scroll down for video . A judicial review application submitted by Australian convicted drug traffickers Andrew Chan (right) and Myruan Sukumaran (left) could lead to a window of opportunity for the pair who have been sentenced to execution . Chan and Sukumaran's lawyer, Julian McMahon, argued that his clients had clearly exhibited that they had been rehabilitated since their sentencing in 2006. 'Anyone who studies the facts in the case of Sukumaran and Chan would immediately know they should not be treated as if they are merely criminals. In fact because of the Indonesian penal system they have become reformed prisoners and valuable contributors helping Indonesia. It simply makes no sense now to kill them,' Mr McMahon told News Corp. The sliver of hope comes after it was revealed on Monday that the Bali Nine pair would be killed by a firing squad in the next round of executions. The pair, who have been on death row since 2006, could face death at any stage under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases. 'There is no difficulty. We just have to look at all the regulations, including the Constitutional Court decision, the Supreme Court decree as well as the joint decision that was made in January,' Mr Riyono said on Tuesday, rather than dismissing the appeal . According to Nine News Sukumaran and Chan will be taken in the dead of night from their cells at Kerobokan Prison in Denpasar and flown to Jogjakarta. From there they will take a five-hour journey through the villages of Java before they arrive at the port of Cilicap. The men will then be taken by boat into restricted waters, where they will get their first glimpse of the notorious correctional centre on Nusa Kambangan. From there the Australian men will be housed in one of the seven prisons on the island, where they will live out the remainder of their days before they are lined up in front of the executioners. Nusa Kambangan is where the Bali bombers faced the firing squad and where six drug criminals were executed two weeks ago. Meanwhile appeals for the two men's lives continue to be made, the latest of which has come from a British band known as one of the Indonesian President's favourites. Napalm Death's lead singer Mark 'Barney' Greenway penned a letter to Joko Widodo asking him to grant clemency to the convicted drug traffickers . Napalm Death's lead singer Mark 'Barney' Greenway penned a letter to Joko Widodo asking him to grant clemency to the convicted drug traffickers and posting the open letter  to the band's Facebook page last month, for their 729,000 followers to read. Mr Widodo is said to be a big fan of metal, and recently revealed in an interview that he discovered the genre when he stumbled across a thrash metal band gig when he was just 14 years old. 'I am appealing directly to you to please spare the lives of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, the two Australian citizens who are currently awaiting the death sentence in Indonesia for heroin smuggling,' the letter began. 'As a follower of our band Napalm Death, you would appreciate that our lyrics and ethos challenge the unbroken cycle of violence in the world, whether it comes from a state or as an individual. Mr Widodo is said to be a big fan of metal, and recently revealed in an interview that he discovered the genre when he stumbled across a thrash metal band gig when he was just 14 years old .

I am appealing directly to you to please spare the lives of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, the two Australian citizens who are currently awaiting the death sentence in Indonesia for heroin smuggling. As a follower of our band Napalm Death, you would appreciate that our lyrics and ethos challenge the unbroken cycle of violence in the world, whether it comes from a state or as an individual. If these things are not challenged and ultimately changed, I believe we will never truly move forward as humankind. I understand that you are standing as a leader determined to change things for the better, and so I believe granting clemency would be a major step forward in this pursuit of betterment. I appreciate that heroin can be damaging on many levels, but I believe that this is a much deeper issue that cannot be changed or altered by simply taking away the lives of people. Again, I respectfully ask that you make a real difference and overturn these sentences. In hope and peace, . Mark 'Barney' Greenway (Napalm Death) 'If these things are not challenged and ultimately changed, I believe we will never truly move forward as humankind,' the post continued. Joko Widodo has been pictured posing while wearing a Napalm Death t-shirt on multiple occasions, and is reportedly a big fan of other heavy metal bands such as Metallica, Megadeath and Lamb of God. He is also known for his hardline approach to issues such as drug trafficking, selling his election campaign - in part - on tougher penalties for criminals. Napalm Death is a band credited with defining the grindcore genre - an amalgamation of elements from hardcore death and punk metal. They also hold a Guinness World Record for the world's shortest song - titled You Suffer with a duration of 1.316 seconds.","A judicial review application submitted by Andrew Chan and Myruan Sukumaran is being looked into by the the Denpasar District Court chief .

"An aide to Labour's leader in Wales has quit the party, branding Ed Miliband an out-of-touch 'Chuckle Brother' who is heading for 'inevitable' defeat in the general election.

It comes as former Labour Cabinet minister Charles Clarke warned voters do not think Mr Miliband will be any better than the Tory-Lib Dem coalition. Ed Miliband has been likened to one of the Chuckle Brothers by an aide to Welsh Labour leader Carwyn Jones who has quit the party . Mr Miliband's leadership has come under increasing pressure in recent days, with senior party figures fearing he is failing to make an impact ahead of the election on May 7. Mr Ellis, a councillor in Bridgend, announced his decision to quit Labour with an excoriating attack on Mr Miliband. Writing on his blog, he said: 'If political strategists all got together in a room to choose a leader with less charisma, sincerity or balls, they couldn't have chosen better than the hapless Chuckle Brother they chose to lead the party to the inevitable defeat coming it's way in less than 100 days. 'There are several sources of information that outline the multimillionaire's catalogue of failures and his massive disconnect with the public could not be more obvious than it already is.' Mr Ellis added: 'I have met both men and without a shadow of a doubt, Jeremy Kyle is more in touch with British voters than 'The wrong Miliband'.' He also claimed Labour in Wales 'has proven to be nothing more than a cult-like mafia that is frightened of free speech'. Luke Ellis, a councillor in Bridgend, announced his decision to quit Labour with an excoriating attack on Mr Miliband . Mr Miliband has come under increasing criticism in recent days from senior Blairite figures in the party unhappy at the direction of his leadership. Lord Mandelson warned Mr Miliband's plan to impose a mansion tax is 'crude' and would end up 'clobbering' people. Lord Hutton and Mr Milburn, two senior Blairites, accused the Labour leader and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls of failing to defend the economic record of the last Labour government. Now Mr Clarke, a former Home Secretary who served in Tony Blair's Cabinet, said voters did not believe Labour would be any better than the coalition. Former home secretary Charles Clarke said voters did not believe Labour would be any better than the coalition . He told The Times: 'The reason why [minor parties have] gained support is because people don't think the Conservatives, Liberals are good and they are not confident enough that Labour will do better. 'Labour's challenge is to ensure that we convince people that we would do better. 'In a general way, I think that investment and reform, which was our slogan in the Blair years, is crucial. Certainly, the party has to campaign on the NHS, but it also has to campaign on education, which is another story of investment and reform. 'It has to campaign on transport, it has to campaign on policing and a whole set of other issues.' Mr Miliband yesterday insisted he has enough 'life experience' outside politics to lead the country - because he had been an adviser to Gordon Brown. The Labour leader said roles in the Treasury and lecturing at Harvard University in the United States before he became an MP qualified him to be prime minister. Mr Miliband highlighted his previous jobs as he took questions from young voters after being asked how he represented ordinary people. He was asked: 'Outside of politics, what life experience do you have ... to indicate you should be the one to represent the people of Britain?' Mr Milband, speaking at an Ask The Leaders session organised by Sky News and Facebook, replied: 'I've done a number of things which I think are relevant to this. 'I was obviously an economic adviser in the Treasury. I think that's important because the economy and how we change our economy is at the heart of the country.' He added: 'I taught at Harvard University. I actually taught around government and economics and I think that, actually, one of the things that that did for me (was learning) to listen and engage with people about what their issues are, what they're interested in.' Mr Miliband went to Oxford University before working briefly as a researcher in the media, and then becoming a Labour Party researcher. He was an adviser to Gordon Brown in the Treasury between 1997 and 2002, at which point he took an 18-month sabbatical to teach economics at Harvard.","Labour councillor quits party with excoriating attack on Ed Miliband .

"The first North American hunters used spear-throwers to hurl their weapons over longer distances and bring down large prey, according to a new study. Anthropologists have studied tiny fractures in the stone spear points used by the Paleo-Indian hunters that began appearing in North America between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. He found they contained distinctive chips and fractures that match those created in stone tools that have been thrown using a spear-thrower or atlatl. Fractures in fluted stone points made by Paleo-Indian cultures, like those above, have helped to reveal that these prehistoric hunters used tools known as atlatl to fling their spears further and harder than believed . These are essentially levers that are attached to the end of the spear or dart, allowing it to be thrown far faster and further than if thrown by hand like a javelin. The technology is widely thought to be a predecessor of the bow and arrow that later became common among the Native cultures in North America. Hunters in Eurasia developed an innovative way of crafting stone tools 325,000 years ago at the same time as it was being developed in Africa. A discovery at a prehistoric site in Armenia shows that a way of producing stone tolls known as Levallois technology developed independently at this site. This approach involves breaking different sizes of flakes off a larger lump of stone. It is seen as being more economical as fewer raw materials are thrown away in the process. However, more primitive stone tools were also found at the same site created using a 'bifacial technology' where tools are created by gradually removing flakes from a rock. It was previously believed that Levallois technology was invented in Africa and spread to Eurasia with expanding human populations. The discovery suggests that Eurasians were more innovative than previously thought and contradicts the widely-held belief that innovation spread as a result of humanity's migration out of Africa. The new study, conducted by Professor Karl Hutchings, an anthropologist at Thompson Rivers University in Canada, suggests that some of the earliest prehistoric humans to arrive in North America, known as the Clovis people, brought this technology with them. It also helps to support theories that these early hunters were able to kill large prey like mammoths and other megafauna.. Professor Hutchings said that it was unlikely a handthrown spear with a stone point, or flute point as they are also known, alone would be enough to bring down such large animals, but a spear-thrower could give hunters the edge they needed. This, he said, would have allowed these cultures to spread far more efficiently around the continent and inhabit a wide range of landscapes. He said: 'Close-range weapons such as the javelin or spear are well-suited to terrain-based hunting strategies. 'With their requirement to drive game into trapping areas and knick points, terrain-based strategies tether big game hunters to specific locations and features, and generally require a considerable number of participants. 'Such features and strategies should enhance greatly the success rates of those close-range weapons. 'In contrast, in addition to providing Paleoindian hunters increased lethality and safety, the portability and range of the spear-thrower may have meant that Paleoindian hunters were not tethered to trapping areas and knick points, thereby facilitating greater mobility and reduced hunting-group sizes.' The Clovis culture, named after the first stone tools discovered in Clovis, New Mexico, are thought to be the ancestors of most of the indigenous cultures in the Americas. Professor Hutchings found microscopic fracture lines in the stone spear points (above) that matched those found in stone tipped spears that have been thrown with high velocity using a tool like an atlatl . Prehistoric petrogylphs, like the one above, etched into the rock in the Valley of Fire State Park, in Nevada, depict hunters using using atlatl to throw spears at animals and has been seen as evidence of the technology . However, there are several other prehistoric Paleo-Indian cultures that have been found to have been living in North America at around the end of the last ice age. Some of the first evidence that these hunters used spear-throwers come from crude stone drawings in caves and on rocks that depict them bringing down large prey. In some of the drawings, tools that look like atlatl can also be seen. As these atlatls were probably made from wood, however, none have been found among the archaeological evidence as it is unlikely they would have survived. In Europe, ancient spear throwers tended to be made from ivory or bone, while hunters in the Old World are known to have started using these at least 18,000 years ago. Some have suggested that 11,000 year old 'bannerstones' found among Paleo-Indian remains could have functioned as weights on spear-throwers. Spear-thrower hooks have also been found in the Warm Mineral Springs in Florida, but these date to around 9,000 years ago, sometime after the Paleo-Indian period. With handheld spear,s hunters would have been forced to drive large prey like mammoths over cliffs to kill them, as is depicted in the illustration above, but atlatl tools could have let them kill them on open ground . These drawings in Upper Renegade Canyon of the Coso Mountains of California are thought to depict altatl technology that was developed by Paleo-Indian cultures that first inhabited North America 13,000 years ago . Professor Hutchings said his findings, published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, suggest that the Clovers people and other early Paleo-Indians were using this technology when they first appeared in North America. He examined 55 stone artifacts from the Clovis culture, the Folsom culture, which dates to around 11,000 years ago, and other Paleo-Indians, for distinctive fracture points that occur when a stone point impacts after being thrown at high velocity. He found that around half showed fractures that corresponded to being propelled from a spear-thrower. He also found that subtle differences in some of the fractures suggested that these early North American hunters were experimenting with the way they tied the stone tips to the spear shafts. He said: 'Dynamic loading rates, indicating high-velocity fractures, were indicated not only on Clovis and Folsom fluted points, but on other early point types including Plano, Midland, Western Pluvial Lakes Stemmed, Great Basin Stemmed, and Windust. 'Interestingly, this indicates that no one hafting technique was uniquely associated with spear-thrower technology during this period, and may further suggest that late-Pleistocene and early Holocene hunters were experimenting with hafting methods independent of delivery technologies.' A guide in Seminole Canyon State Park, Texas, is seen above demonstrating how an atlatl would have worked .","Paleo-Indians began appearing in North America around 13,000 years ago .
Scientists studied stone spear points for distinctive chips and fractures .
They found the fractures matched those from spears thrown at high speeds .
Spear-throwers, or atlatl, would have allowed ancient hunters to hurl their weapons over longer distances and with more lethality than by hand alone .
Anthropologists say this would have enabled hunters to kill megafauna ."
"Al-Jazeera journalist Mohamed Fahmy is set for an 'imminent' release from prison in Egypt, Canada's foreign minister has said. A dual Egyptian-Canadian citizen, Fahmy has been held for more than a year on charges of spreading false news. He has reportedly relinquished his Egyptian citizenship in exchange for his freedom. Jailed: Al-Jazeera English producer Baher Mohamed, left, Canadian-Egyptian acting Cairo bureau chief Mohammed Fahmy, centre, and correspondent Peter Greste, right, in court  during their trial . John Baird, Canada's foreign minister, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation he expected Fahmy's release, but gave no specific timing. The development comes after Fahmy's Australian colleague Peter Greste was released on Sunday. Hopes for Fahmy's release have also been raised after a decree passed by Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi that allows for the transfer of foreigners on trial. But Heather Allan, head of newsgathering at Al-Jazeera, admitted she wasn't confident locally-based producer Baher Mohamed, an Egyptian, would be released. '(But) are we going to keep on fighting it? Absolutely,' she said. 'We are not going to leave him there.' Mohamed's family have pinned their hopes on a presidential pardon or his acquittal on appeal. Greste yesterday revealed it was traumatic leaving his colleagues behind in a Cairo prison and he didn't truly believe he was being freed until he was seated on a plane bound for Cyprus. He used his first interview since being deported from Egypt to call on the country to release other detained journalists including Al Jazeera colleagues Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed. 'You spend 400 days in such close proximity with people and you really get to know them very, very well,' the 49-year-old told Al Jazeera in Cyprus on Monday. 'So it was a very difficult moment walking out of that prison, saying goodbye to those guys, not knowing how much longer they will have to put up with this.' Journalists: Hopes for the release of Fahmy, left, have been raised by a presidential decree allowing for the transfer of foreigners on trial. But that decree will not cover his Egyptian colleague Mohamed, right . Greste, Fahmy and Mohammed were arrested in December 2013 and later convicted over their coverage of the violent crackdown on Islamist protests that year. Mr Baird spoke with his Egyptian counterpart on Sunday and said he welcomed Greste's release. He said he remained hopeful that Fahmy's case will be resolved in 'short order.' Fahmy's brother, Adel Fahmy, said authorities gave him a stark choice: 'dropping the nationality or his freedom.' 'It was a very difficult decision. Mohamed is very proud and comes from a patriotic family of high ranking military and policemen that have defended this country and fought its wars,' Adel Fahmy said. He said many of those family members are offended and upset at Mohamed for dropping his nationality and don't want to even say goodbye to him. Adel Fahmy said his brother, who was Al-Jazeera English's Cairo bureau chief, was devastated but his fiancée and his mother told him do it. He said authorities told his brother he would be allowed to return as a tourist. Freed: But Greste, pictured, yesterday revealed it was traumatic leaving his colleagues behind in a Cairo prison and he didn't truly believe he was being freed until he was seated on a plane bound for Cyprus . Greste yesterday told Al-Jazeera that he wasn't expecting to be released ahead of a scheduled retrial. Then, as he exercised in prison on Sunday, a warder called him over and told him to pack his things. 'I said ""What do you mean?"" and he said ""You're going"" and I said ""Where, to another prison?"" and he said ""No the (Australian) embassy is coming they'll be here in an hour"".' He said even when driving to the airport on Sunday he wondered if his ordeal was really coming to end given there'd been other moments when freedom appeared imminent but was 'snatched away'. 'So I really didn't want to let myself believe it really was happening until I got my backside on a seat on the plane with my brother Mike and we knew, then, that for me at least, this is over.'","Canadian-Egyptian national Fahmy was Al-Jazeera's Cairo bureau chief .

"Lance Armstrong let his long-term girlfriend lie to police that she was behind the wheel after he hit two parked cars following night of partying in Aspen, according to authorities. Police have now cited Armstrong after the December 28 hit-and-run, but only after his girlfriend, Anna Hansen, admitted to lying for him to avoid national attention. Hansen told them she had been driving home from a party when she lost control of Armstrong's SUV, hitting the cars, according to police. Scroll down for video . Lance Armstrong made his long-term girlfriend Anna Hansen lie to police that she was behind the wheel after he hit two parked cars following night of partying in Aspen, according to authorities (file photo) Pictured: Police photos of a parked vehicle which was allegedly hit by Lance Armstrong . Damage can be seen on the back of a car. Hansen eventually told officers Armstrong was driving, and they both decided to let her take the blame . But Hansen eventually told officers Armstrong was driving, and they both decided to let her take the blame. According to the Apsen Daily Times, the 43-year-old has now been issued with two traffic citations - failing to report an accident and exceeding safe speed. They had initially been given to Hansen, the mother of two of his children, Maxwell and Olivia. Aspen police detective Rick Magnuson wrote in his report that Hansen told them she had driven home from a party at Aspen Art Museum because 'Lance had a little bit to drink so I was driving. I was not drinking.' She told him she lost control of the car and hit parked cars on West Francis Street, but spoke to the homeowner, telling him she would pay for the damage.

Armstrong and Hansen with their children,  Maxwell Edward and Olivia Marie in Miami in 2013. He has three other children with his ex-wife . Police say they cited Armstrong after the December 28 hit-and-run but only after his girlfriend, Anna Hansen, admitted to lying for him to avoid national attention (both pictured in 2012) The West End homeowner said: 'A woman, well-dressed, 30ish, blond … came running around the corner in her high heels in 6 inches of packed snow, which was pretty impressive; she ran directly to us and said, ""We’re so sorry, we came around the corner and slipped on the ice, and we hit your cars.""' “She said, ‘I’m Anna, we’re the Armstrongs, my husband’s Lance, he was just driving too fast around the corner or something,’” the report states. The homeowner informed police and although they wrote Hanson the tickets, they remained suspicious and spoke to the valet at the St. Regis Aspen Resort - he  said he had assisted Hansen to the passenger side of the GMC. Hansen was called to the courthouse and she admitted that Armstrong had been driving. The police report states she denied Armstrong asked her to cover, insisting it was a 'joint decision.' 'We’ve had our family name smeared over every paper in the world in the last couple of years and honestly, I’ve got teenagers, I just wanted to protect my family because I thought, ""Gosh, Anna Hansen hit some cars, it’s not going to show up in the papers, but Lance Armstrong hit some cars, it’s going to be a national story,'"" she said. Deputy district attorney Andrea Bryan said Hansen was not charged with making a false report to police because she was cooperative. The disgraced cyclists was stripped of his record seven Tour de France titles after taking banned substances . Armstrong, who is due in court March 17, declined immediate comment, and his attorney didn't immediately return a call. He met Hansen in July 2008 through his charity work. Lance was previously married to Kristin Richard, whom he shares three children with, before divorcing in 2003. He then famously dated Cheryl Crowe soon after, announcing their engagement in 2005 before ultimately splitting in 2006. Armstrong then moved onto a high profile relationship with Kate Hudson. Armstrong won the Tour de France every year from 1999-2005. Those titles were stripped after a report by the US Anti-Doping Agency detailed the use of performance enhancing drugs by Armstrong and his US Postal Service teammates.","Police say they cited Armstrong after the December 28 hit-and-run but only after his girlfriend, Anna Hansen, admitted to lying for him .

"A pregnant teenager was allegedly groped by a 38-year-old paramedic in an ambulance last month. Joseph Hartsfield, who works for the Memphis Fire Department, allegedly groped a 17-year-old girl traveling to St. Francis Hospital, MyFoxMemphis reported. In the girl's account to authorities, she said she was groped by Hartsfield during the trip, and that the paramedic posed sexual questions as well as behaved in a 'creepy' manner, according to the affiliate station. Scroll down for video . Paramedic: Joseph Hartsfield, pictured, allegedly groped a pregnant 17-year-old's breast in an ambulance . MyFoxMemphis reported that the girl spoke to a St. Francis nurse, and that both police and fire departments were contacted by the hospital. An affidavit, excerpts of which were published by WREG, said the 17-year-old claimed Hartsfield posed questions 'of a sexual nature' on January 8. Hartsfield allegedly felt one of the girl's breasts and 'lifted her breast and felt under her breast,' the affidavit said of the girl's account. It continued, 'The victim stated the Defendant was acting ""creepy"".' WREG reported that Hartsfield did not face charges over an allegation of 'forcible fondling' last year. Lt. Wayne Cooke, a fire department representative, told The Commerical Appeal 'After he is released, the administration will determine his job status.' Cooke told the newspaper Hartsfield has been a MFD employee since October 2008. An inmate information page from the Shelby County Sheriff's Office says Hartsfield has been charged with two sexual battery charges, with his bond set at $5,000. The MFD did not immediately return a Daily Mail Online request for comment.

"Two weeks after HTC sent save the date invitations for a launch in Barcelona, Samsung has attempted to steal its thunder. On 1 March, both smartphone makers are hosting events in the Spanish city, to kick off this year’s Mobile World Congress (MWC). HTC is expected to unveil its HTC One M9, while Samsung will likely use its event to announce the Samsung Galaxy S6. Scroll down for video . On 1 March, Samsung and HTC are separately hosting events in Barcelona, to kick off this year’s Mobile World Congress (MWC). HTC is expected to unveil its HTC One M9, while Samsung will likely use its event to announce the Samsung Galaxy S6. Samsung's invite hints at a curved device (pictured) HTC’s event begins at 4pm CET (3pm GMT and 10am ET) and its green and blue invitation says: ‘Utopia in progress. Join us to see what’s next.’ Samsung’s invitation is black and features a white line with a curve at the end, with the words ‘what’s next.’ Its event starts at 6.30pm CET (5.30pm GMT and 12.30 ET) and will be streamed live on YouTube. In terms of what will be announced. Rumours suggest HTC will use the event to unveil its next flagship phone, dubbed HTC One M9. HTC’s event begins at 4pm CET (3pm GMT and 10am ET) and the green and blue invitation says: ‘Utopia in progress. Join us to see what’s next’ It will be the follow up to the One M8, released at last year’s MWC, and leaked specifications suggest it will include the 64-bit octa-core Snapdragon 810 processor and a 5-inch screen. The leaks also claim the next-generation device will include 3GB of RAM, run the latest version of Android, and feature a 20.7MP rear-facing camera. Meanwhile, Samsung's next generation Galaxy handset could have a curved screen that covers both its sides. The handset, which is expected to have a 5.5-inch screen to rival Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus, will come in a 'special edition' version with the curved technology, according to Sammobile. The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over Apple, and the curved screen has already been used in Samsung's Note Edge. However, S6 Edge will have the ability to work in a left or right handed mode. Previous leaks from BGR said the SM-G925F, the codename believed to be assigned to the Galaxy S6, will feature a Quad HD, 2560 x 1440 resolution, display. It will also have an octa-core processor, Mali-T768 graphics processing unit, and a 16MP rear-facing camera. Samsung surprised audiences at the Berlin-based trade show IFA in September when it unveiled its curved device. The screen was described by Samsung's David Park at the event as working like a 'ticker', with notifications and news scrolling along it . Rumours suggest HTC will use the event to unveil its next flagship phone, dubbed HTC One M9. Leaked specifications (pictured) suggest it will include the 64-bit octa-core Snapdragon 810 processor and a 5-inch screen. The leaks also claim the Android device will include 3GB of RAM and feature a 20.7MP rear camera . The Galaxy Note Edge's unique curved touchscreen provides quick access to frequently used apps and alerts. The curved screen displays notifications at the top and bottom, while viewing a video without disruption, for example. Because the curved edge remains visible even if a flip-book style protective cover is used, it is easier to keep up-to-date with incoming calls and messages. Previous leaks from BGR said the SM-G925F - the codename used for the Galaxy S6 - will feature a 2560 x 1440 resolution display, octa-core processor, Mali-T768 graphics processing unit, and a 16MP rear-facing camera. In December, in the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year. Earlier this week, HTC America posted this video on YouTube. It's a rap parody poking fun at Samsung and Apple. Lyrics include: 'More than a few clowns stole what we originated. We own the universe, your Galaxy is overrated', and 'It took you copycats six times to get it right/My One M8 is great, you’ll never touch this light' Meanwhile, Samsung's next generation Galaxy handset could have a curved screen that covers both its sides. The handset is also expected to have a 5.5-inch screen to rival Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus. Samsung's Galaxy Note Edge (pictured) was the first to use a curved screen when it was unveiled in Berlin last year . Instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better. The South Korean manufacturer is also expected to ramp up production of its remaining models so they can be sold more cheaply. The strategy was unveiled during a presentation in New York by Samsung's head of investor relations, Robert Yi. He said the company would reduce the number of smartphone models in 2015 by between a quarter and a third. In a rare acknowledgement, Mr Yi added that Samsung had lagged behind changing market conditions. The company moved the launch of the Galaxy Note 4, a large smartphone with a stylus, to late September from October after Apple unveiled the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It also began sales of the Galaxy Note 4 in China last month, getting an early start in the world's most populous country before Apple.

It also began sales of the Galaxy Note 4 in China last month, getting an early start in the world's most populous country before Apple . Apple released it first phablet-style devices in September, and it appears the gamble paid off. During the first quarter of 2015, Apple announced it sold a staggering 74.5 million iPhones in the same quarter - up from 51 million during the same period a year ago. These was the first quarter that the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were on sale. However, sales of iPads dropped by 18 per cent, which knocked Apple's revenue in that sector by 22 per cent. This was the largest year-on-year decrease released by Apple. The decline has been blamed on a dip in tablet popularity in general, as well as the rising popularity of phablets. As phones increase in size, and close the gap between the size of tablet displays, analysts predict fewer people will buy, or need, the two gadgets. The company's response 'was not quick enough,' said Mr Yi.","On 1 March, both smartphone makers are hosting events in Barcelona .

"The terrifying moment an avalanche thunders down a mountainside has been captured by brave photographers at Vallee de la Sionne, near Sion in Switzerland. Incredible images reveal the snow crashing down the mountain at more than 50mph (80km/h) as scientists watch from a hut close to the avalanche's path. The full-scale avalanche was triggered by scientists using explosives as part of an experiment to help them understand and model avalanche motion. Scroll down for video . The terrifying moment an avalanche thunders down a mountainside has been captured by brave photographers near Sion in Switzerland . Researchers at the Swiss Institute of Research of Snow used seismic sensors - usually used to detect earthquakes - to record ground vibrations that could pick up an avalanche. Meanwhile, photographers took pictures so that they could compare it with the seismic data to estimate the size of future events. Another key measurement is snow temperature, and researchers collected data on this before, during and after the avalanche. Scientists are hoping to learn more about how avalanches form. They believe the most deadly type of avalanche, dubbed a 'slab avalanche,' forms when an area of snow shatters and slides off the mountainside. The avalanche was triggered by scientists using explosives as part of an experiment to help them understand avalanche motion .

Researchers at the Swiss Institute of Research of Snow used seismic sensors, usually used to detect earthquakes, to record ground vibrations that could suggest and impending avalanche. On the right, a helicopter monitors the scene . The most common and deadly type of avalanche is called a 'slab avalanche,' when an area of of snow shatters and slides off the mountainside. Loud noises aren't the main culprit. Instead, these avalanches tend to take place when snow builds up quickly, and weight is suddenly put on it. When this happens, a weak area below the snow causes a slab to break off. Loud noises aren't the main culprit in this type of avalanche. Instead, these avalanches tend to take place when snow builds up quickly, and weight is suddenly placed on the fresh snow. When this happens, a weak area below the snow causes a slab to break off. It is estimated that around 90 per cent of avalanche accidents involving people are triggered by the weight victim or someone with the victim. The largest avalanches form from powder snow. They create turbulent currents that consist of a powder cloud, which overlies a dense avalanche. They can exceed speeds of 186 mph (300 km/h), and masses of 10,000,000 tonnes. The study of avalanches can be dangerous in itself. Last month, a Colorado woman who studied the science of snow died after falling victim to the very thing she found so fascinating. A small slide hit backcountry skier Olivia Buchanan of Durango and she later died at a hospital. Ms Buchanan was studying geography, focusing on snow science, at Montana State University in Bozeman and had been an intern at the Silverton Avalanche School. She was on the Rabbit Ears avalanche path, also known as the Arcade path, of Kendall Mountain near Silverton, Colorado when the tragedy struck.

"Viewers were left choking on their cornflakes this morning after a testicular cancer check was carried out live on TV. As part of a promotion for a campaign aimed at encouraging men to examine their testicles for signs of the disease, a volunteer was brought on to ITV's Lorraine to be checked on air by Dr Hilary Jones. Referred to only as Charlie, the young man was asked to strip off and follow the GP's instructions as he guided him through the signs of what to look for when checking for cancer. However, viewers, who tune into Lorraine Kelly's show in their millions, saw more than they bargained for - as there were close-up shots of the man's scrotum. Scroll down for video . Coming up next... Lorraine, right, introduces the #CheckYourChaps section with the volunteer and Dr Hilary . A volunteer called Charlie (left), followed Dr Hilary Jones's instructions (right) to check his private area . Dr Hilary said he hoped the demonstration, for the campaign #CheckYourChaps would encourage early detection of testicular and prostate cancer and commended Charlie on his bravery. ‘It takes a lot of balls to do something like that,’ he said, seemingly unaware of his double entendre. Despite good intentions, some Lorraine viewers found watching the young man feeling his scrotum distasteful. 'Eating my breakfast with my one-year-old granddaughter, I didn't want to see this at breakfast time. Time and a place for things like this, I love Lorraine but this is distasteful for morning viewing. Sorry,' one viewer posted on the website. Lorraine gives the thumbs up after the live demonstration on the show . Other viewers took to Twitter to air their concerns. Amy Bowman wrote: 'Sat down to eat my breakfast, put the tele on and I see a pair of balls.' Nathan Hodkin tweeted: 'I get that it's for a good cause and all that, but... really? At 5 past 9 in the morning? Mary Whitehouse will be spinning. #Lorraine' Twitter user @RobBot posted, 'Just turned ITV on while eating my toast to be faced with a pair of testicles, not what I expected #CheckYourChaps #Lorraine' 'Omg.... Its WAY too early to be seeing a pair of balls on #lorraine #ballsinyourface,' tweeted another shocked viewer, Leanne Ellen. Despite good intentions, some Lorraine viewers found watching the young man feeling his scrotum distasteful . Others were more positive about the controversial demonstration . One viewer slammed the critics on the show's website . 'All for a good cause but that put me right off my boiled egg!.. #Lorraine,' read another surprised tweet. But some viewers were more positive about the controversial demonstration. Margaret Littlewood retorted to the criticism on the shows website posting: 'Bit prudish of you and the 1 year old wouldn't be offended I'm sure, men do need to know how to do this' While Derren John Luscombe Harvey added: 'I'm no doctor but I'm almost sure your 1 year old granddaughter has no idea what was on the telly this morning, spreading awareness of testicular cancer and how to check for signs is an important issue, sorry if it momentarily put you off your toast!' Other viewers took to Twitter to air their concerns . It may not have helped digest breakfast but at least it was for a good cause . One twitter user felt it was not the right time to be faced with naked body parts on TV . As the demonstration kicked off, Dr Hilary guided Charlie through an examination. 'Cup your ball bag with your right hand,' he said. 'Whenever you look in the mirror to do this you might find that one testicle might be bigger or hangs lower than the other - this completely normal. Dr Hilary, who recommended having a bath or warm shower before doing the check, continued: 'With the right hand put your thumb in front of the left testicle and fourth finger and middle finger behind it and roll the finger between the two. Brian and Vogue made a visit to ITV show Lorraine to discuss Check Your Chaps on Monday . 'Feel the contour of the testicle. It’s like an elongated egg and should be nice and smooth. 'You're feeling for any discreet lumps,' he explained. 'If you do that from 14 to 45 you’ll detect any change,' Dr Hilary advised. There are 2,300 cases of testicular cancer in the UK every year. There's a 98 per cent survival rate but those two per cent could be saved with greater awareness. Dr Hilary told viewers: 'If everyone just did what Charlie just demonstrated,60 lives a year would be saved.' Brian McFadden and his wife of two years, Vogue, joined forces to launch the campaign urging men to get tested for testicular and prostate cancer on yesterday's Lorraine.","Live demonstration took place on Lorraine Kelly's ITV breakfast show .

"Around 500 holidaymakers have had their trips cancelled after norovirus broke out at a popular holiday village in Norfolk. Potters Resort, near Great Yarmouth, has been forced to close its doors after the 100 people reported symptoms of the winter vomiting bug at the weekend. It was initially believed to have been confined to a coach-load of guests who left on Friday, but further confirmed cases appeared. Resort at Hopton-on-Sea, Norfolk, confirmed that 100 people reported norovirus winter vomiting symptoms at the weekend . The resort, which can accommodate 3,000 people, cancelled around 500 guests who were due to stay from Monday until Friday and has offered a full refund. Actor Shaun Williamson, who played Barry Evans in Eastenders, performed at the venue on both Saturday and Sunday evening despite being warned about the outbreak. However the professional singer, who performed with a swing band, decided not to stay overnight on Sunday as originally planned, due to 'work commitments'. The on-site beauty salon, health and fitness club and Black Rock Grill restaurant were also closed. The resort is now 'fully cleaning' the resort and is expecting to reopen for a new batch of guests on Friday. However many guests, who were due to go home last Sunday, have extended their stay free of charge until they get better. Former Eastenders actor Shaun Williamson performed at the venue despite the norovirus outbreak at the weekend . Staff have asked them not to leave their rooms and are instead bringing their meals to them, which is included in the holiday price. Jacqui Adams, 59, from Clacton, Essex, arrived on Friday and said they were told there had been cases of norovirus, but it was now clear. She said she started feeling ill on Saturday morning and was told to stay in her chalet. She added: 'I don't think they dealt with it very well - they should have shut all the chalets down and done a really deep clean then. 'I now can't go to work, because I've got to be 48 hours clear before I can go back.' John Potter, managing director, said the decision to close was 'unprecedented, but all procedures were followed.' He said: 'On Friday we had a deep clean, followed our procedures and delayed the check-in for the guests coming in later. 'There were no cases on the resort on Friday morning. It wasn't until Saturday night that we had 10 (more) cases. 'On Sunday, we made the decision to say we would put people before profits as this thing could get a lot worse.' The resort has postponed Wednesday's planned celebration for former owner Brian Potter, who died last year aged 73. A Potters Resort spokeswoman said: 'The wellbeing of our guests and staff is paramount and therefore we have made the decision to temporarily close, so that we can conduct a thorough deep cleanse to end the virus. 'We have advised the relevant public health authorities and they have praised our preventative course of action. Guests due to check in today have been contacted to advise them of the closure and will receive a full refund. 'We apologise for the inconvenience that this will have caused our guests, but believe that this unprecedented move is necessary.' She added that the guests confined to their room or who have gone home early will be compensated for the days lost.","Potters Resort, near Great Yarmouth, has been forced to close its doors .

"Reggie Love got an eyewitness account to history working as then-Senator Barack Obama's body man during his 2008 presidential campaign. And now, the man who Obama himself calls his 'little brother', is revealing inside stories from his days working as the right hand man to one of the most powerful, and closely-guarded, men in the world - shortly before the release of his upcoming memoir, Power Forward: My Presidential Education. The book details everything from how he introduced his boss to the music of Jay Z and President Obama's collection of good-luck charms to the Hillary Clinton meltdown during the Democratic primary that left Obama positive he would secure the party's nomination. Scroll down for video . Reggie Love (above with President Obama) is sharing stories from his years working as Obama's personal assistant . One section of the book, Power Forward, My Presidential Education (right) details the moment Hillary Clinton (left) 'unraveled' following a talk with Obama . 'I was his DJ, his Kindle, his travel agent, his valet, his daughters' basketball coach, his messenger, his punching bag, his alarm clock, his vending machine, his chief of stuff, his note passer, his spades partner, his party planner, his workout partner, his caterer, his small forward, his buffer, his gatekeeper, his surrogate son, and ultimately, improbably, luckily, his friend,' he writes. 'I carried snacks and the luggage, babysat for the children of world leaders, prepped the teleprompter and the operator, and handled a million other tasks that came up on the fly.' No story is more shocking however that the one Love tells of the moment Hillary Clinton 'unraveled' during a talk with Obama on the airport tarmac at Reagan National Airport. In December 2007, at the height of the Democratic primary, Billy Shaheen, co-chair of Clinton's New Hampshire campaign, went on the record in an interview saying that Obama could never win the presidency as his admissions to drug use in his youth would open the door to let his Republican candidate slaughter him, and possibly even label him a drug dealer. On this day, Clinton and Obama were both on their private jets parked next to one another on the tarmac when Clinton offered Obama an apology for what had happened. Love writes: '""I want to apologize for the whole Shaheen thing,” she said. “I want you to know I had nothing to do with it.” 'The candidate very respectfully told her the apology was kind, but largely meaningless, given the emails it was rumored her camp had been sending out labeling him as a Muslim. 'Before he could finish his sentence, she exploded on Obama. In a matter of seconds, she went from composed to furious. ' It had not been Obama’s intention to upset her, but he wasn’t going to play the fool either. To all of us watching the spat unfold, it was an obvious turning point in our campaign, and we knew it.' 'He knew he was going to win the nomination after that moment on the tarmac, because Clinton had unraveled,' said Love of his former boss in an interview with The Des Moines Register. And while Clinton did not seem to be the source of much joy for Obama on the campaign trail, there is one thing the man was sure to save wherever he went - good luck charms. 'Everything from military badges to poker chips to special rocks to handmade dream catchers,' explains Love. And while most would do little to hold on to these trinkets, Obama keeps them in the White House Treaty Room, viewing them as pieces of 'silent encouragement' from the public. Love also claims that he introduced President Obama to the music of Jay Z (above with Bruce Springsteen) Most importantly however, Love, the self-proclaimed only 'brother' in the White House, reveals that the relationship between Jay Z and President Obama all began when he introduced his boss to the rapper's music. He also details Obama's routine and needs - in particular his must-have: Nicorette, normal flavor, two milligrams. Also on the list of things he needed through the day were Dentyne Ice, his preferred gum, MET-Rx Protein Plus, a meal replacement bar, and strict instructions on food: no salads while traveling in a vehicle, silverware, napkins, water and green tea. Love discloses that Obama's typical breakfast on the campaign trail was eggs, wheat toast and bacon. He was responsible for his lunch as well, usually consisting of grilled fish or grilled chicken. The would-be president liked a ranch dressing or vinaigrette, sandwiches and Gala apples. 'Mealtime was his only reprieve from the stress of the day,' Love writes.

"As the daughter of British musician Phil Collins and his second wife, American Jill Tavelman, actress Lily Collins boasts an impressive heritage when it comes to living life in the spotlight. But the 25-year-old actress, who will next be seen on the big screen starring in romantic comedy Love, Rosie, due for release in the US on February 6, has admitted that she feels as though she has inherited 'two polar opposites' when it comes to her parents diverse personality traits and their unique takes on style. 'It's so polar opposite, but that's me,' Lily explained to Yahoo Style. 'I have these two different histories.' Scroll down for video .

Out on her own: While appearing in a shoot for Yahoo Style, the Love, Rosie star admitted that she refused to use her father's fame in order to advance her own career . While posing in a series of beautifully ethereal images for the online fashion publication, Lily also confessed that, when it comes to shopping, her parents have completely different takes on what makes for the perfect trip. 'I remember [my dad and I] used to go to Abercrombie and Fitch together,' she revealed. 'We'd have Abercrombie shopping trips together — go figure.' But while her father enjoyed sharing with her his love of simple main street designs, Lily's mother Jill, with whom she moved to Los Angeles following her parents divorce, passed on a love of vintage fashion finds, making sure to introduce her daughter to some of the world's best-loved brands. 'When I was growing up, I was really into vintage,' Lily added. '[My mom] has all the vintage Vivienne Westwood and all these cool pieces that are so hard to find.' When it comes to her acting career however, Lily was determined to go it alone - without the help of her famous father's name, or his influence. Style star: The brunette beauty mixes her mother's love of unique vintage pieces with a more clean cut European aesthetic, which she inherited from her time spent living in Britain . Family affair: Despite their divorce, Lily's parents, musician Phil Collins and antiques dealer Jill Tavelman (pictured with Lily on her 23rd birthday), appear to be on good terms . The screen star, whose big break came in the form of a supporting role in 2009 big screen hit The Blind Side, in which she appeared alongside Oscar winner Sandra Bullock, admitted that she used to drive herself to any auditions or meetings that she needed to attend - and made sure never to mention any details about her father's profession. When it came to preparing for her most recently role however - playing a pregnant teenager in British-based romantic comedy Love, Rosie - Lily was ready to re-embrace the English accent that she lost all those years ago. And as for portraying the emotional aspects of her character's unexpected pregnancy, Lily couldn't have been happier with how the film detailed the journey. 'Rosie is very real, and she's someone who is forced to grow up very quickly,' she reflected. 'She is a very strong, empowered young female. I found that really inspiring because it was showing this teenage pregnancy in a way that was very uplifting as opposed to negative.'","The 25-year-old's parents divorced when she was five, after 12 years of marraige .

"A juror was dismissed on Tuesday in the murder trial of ex-New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez after the woman admitted to lying about being a big fan of the team. Judge Susan Garsh said today that the juror had been to more Pats games than she wrote on her jury questionnaire and had previously expressed an interest in serving on the jury. Hernandez, a former Patriots tight-end, is accused of the June 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, a semi-pro football player who was dating his fiancée's sister. 'There is credible evidence that the juror did talk about the case over the last few years, and that the juror expressed a specific opinion about the case,' said the judge at Massachusetts Superior Court in Fall River. Scroll down for video . Former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez glances towards the family of victim Odin Lloyd during his trial at Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, Massachusetts on Tuesday . After a closed hearing on the matter, the judge said the female juror had held opinions about the murder trial and said it would be difficult for prosecutors to convict Hernandez without a murder weapon. 'Over the last few years, the juror has expressed an interest in serving on this particular jury', Garsh said. 'There is credible evidence that the juror has attended more Patriots games than were disclosed on the questionnaire.' The juror also reportedly discussed evidence that has been ruled out of the trial. The judge had earlier closed the courtroom to the public and the media  to deal with a juror issue. Prosecutors requested the closure, and the defense did not object. The judge spent about 20 minutes earlier on Tuesday questioning a juror in open court but outside the hearing of the public. Prosecutors, the defense team and Hernandez huddled around her as the judge murmured questions. As Garsh closed the court, she said questioning in that manner was difficult and this was the only reasonable alternative. 'The closure is no broader than necessary to protect the interest of the state,' she said. The trial will now continue with five alternate jurors. Tuesday was the first day back at the trial since the Patriots won the Super Bowl. Bristol County Judge Susan Garsh closed the court to the public on Tuesday to question a juror . The judge told jurors they were allowed to watch the game but had to leave the room or distance themselves if Hernandez's name came up. Proceedings began last week but were suspended Monday when a snowstorm hit. Tuesday was the first day back at the trial since the Patriots won the Super Bowl on Sunday. The judge told jurors they were allowed to watch the game but had to leave the room or distance themselves if Hernandez's name came up. Proceedings began last week but were suspended Monday when a snowstorm hit. Tuesday was the first day back at the trial since the Patriots won the Super Bowl on Sunday. The judge told jurors they were allowed to watch the game but had to leave the room or distance themselves if Hernandez's name came up. Hernandez, 25, had a $40 million contract with the Patriots when he was arrested. The Tuesday morning session began with a lengthy private sidebar conversation among the judge, prosecutors and the defense. After about 20 minutes, the juror was called in. In a separate murder case that has yet to go to trial, Hernandez was charged last year in Boston with killing two men in 2012 after someone spilled a drink on him at a nightclub. The judge has ruled that prosecutors in the Lloyd case cannot tell the jury about those slayings. Hernandez faces life imprisonment if convicted of killing Lloyd. Shaneah Jenkins, who was dating Odin Lloyd at the time of his murder, had taken the stand for the defense on Friday during Hernandez's murder trial. She was due to resume testimony on Tuesday before the juror issue arose .","Bristol County Judge Susan Garsh said today that the juror had been to more Pats games than she wrote on her jury questionnaire .

"Indicted: Terrence Cody of the Baltimore Ravens, has been indicted on 15 animal cruelty charges . Terrence Cody, a nose tackle for the Baltimore Ravens, has been indicted on numerous animal cruelty charges and released from the team on the same day. Cody, 26, who has been in the NFL for five years, is facing 15 charges including two counts of aggravated animal cruelty with a dog, five counts of animal abuse or neglect with the same dog and one count of illegal possession of an alligator, according to Deputy State’s Attorney John Cox. The felony aggravated animal cruelty charges, which stem from the death of his Presa Canario Mastiff, carry a maximum sentence of three years and $5,000 fine. Cody was also charged with one count of possession with intent to use drug paraphernalia and one count of possession of marijuana. Baltimore County police said Cody, who turned himself in, was released on $10,000 bail. Peter Schaffer, Cody’s agent, told the Baltimore Sun that the player had taken the dog to see a vet for treatment but the dog subsequently died. Cody maintains his innocence on the dog charges. ‘This is all a result of the NFL allowing players to be convicted before they’re tried,’ Mr Schaffer said. ‘If Terrence wasn’t a public figure, they wouldn’t have ever charged him. It’s just ridiculous. ‘If he was treating the dog so poorly, why would he take it to the veterinarian? They are trying to say he wanted the dog dead, which makes no sense because he loved the dog.’ Mr Schaffer added: ‘He’s done nothing wrong. This could potentially affect his career adversely, and I’m not going to let it happen. This is a quality young man who’s a true animal lover. He wouldn’t hurt a fly, let alone a dog.’ Cut: Cody was drafted by the Ravens in 2010, but was released on Monday after only playing once this year . Cody maintains his innocence with his lawyer saying he took the dog to a vet, where it subsequently died . Two counts of aggravated animal cruelty involving a dog described as a Presa Canario Mastiff. Those are both felonies and carry a maximum incarceration of three years. Five counts of animal abuse or neglect involving the same dog. One count of illegal possession of an alligator. Five counts of animal abuse or neglect involving the alligator. One count of possession with intent to use drug paraphernalia. One count of possession of marijuana. Cody is not under suspicion of dog fighting. Michael Vick, the quarterback who currently plays for the New York jets, served 21 months in prison after pleading guilty to dog fighting charges in 2007. Cody was scheduled to be released on Monday, the earliest that NFL teams can terminate contracts – the day after the Super Bowl. The Ravens had indicated that they were going to release him a couple of weeks ago. Cody was due to become an unrestricted free agent in March. The University of Alabama alumnus was selected in the second round of the 2010 NFL draft. This season, however, he was only active for one game. John Harbaugh, the Ravens coach, said at the end of the season that the ‘threshold of tolerance’ had changed after five players were arrested last year.","Terrence Cody facing up to three years in prison if found guilty of aggravated animal cruelty charges .

"Ryanair has long been accused of a creative approach to geography when it comes to some of the European cities it claims to fly to. So it was inevitable that the budget airline would swiftly become the subject of mockery when a highly imaginative route map from its in-flight magazine Let’s Go came to light. According to the map, Manchester appears to have decamped 75 miles up the M6 to the fringes of the Lake District, while Leeds has also headed north and Newcastle-upon-Tyne is practically in Scotland. Scroll down for video . The map in Ryanair's in-flight magazine seems to have taken a creative approach to some UK city locations . Cities in the Midlands and the south of England have largely been plotted more accurately. But matters are even stranger north of the border, where both Glasgow and Edinburgh are located somewhere near Dundee. Most bizarre of all is in the Irish airline’s native country where Dublin is provocatively placed slap-bang on the border with Northern Ireland - around 50 miles away from its actual location. The curious interpretation was spotted by passengers leafing through the Let’s Go magazine handed out on Ryanair flights. It swiftly drew derision on Twitter, with some wryly pointing out that it is not the first time the airline has been accused of sending passengers miles away from where they expected to be. Twitter users jumped at the chance to poke fun at the budget airline for its  creative approach to geography . Others questioned whether the map was actually the creative handiwork of an outside agency . One Twitter user, Jamie Lawrence, said: ‘Perhaps this explains why Ryanair flights always land a few hours away from your destination.’ Ron Angeles wrote: ‘There’s something so very appropriate over fact that Ryanair in-flight magazine can’t properly locate most airports.’ Most infamously, Ryanair’s flights to Frankfurt actually land at the former ex-US Air Force base Frankfurt-Hahn which is 75 miles or nearly an hour and a half’s drive from the city itself – closer to Luxembourg, in fact. The budget airline became infamous for flying to airports outside of the cities that it advertised . They also came under fire in 2012 for launching a service to an airfield in the Champagne region of France billed as Paris-Vatry-Disney when it is 70 miles from Disneyland Paris and 90 miles from the French capital. Stelios Haji-Ioannou, founder of easyJet, once described the carrier as flying from 'nowhere to nowhere'. Responding to the cities blunder yesterday, a spokesman for Ryanair made light of the glitch, saying: ‘We fly to so many airports (189 across Europe), we can barely fit them on the same page, never mind the same map.’ The airline insists it has moved on from its reputation for obscure destinations, saying it is flying to more ‘primary’ airports than ever with Athens, Lisbon and Glasgow International among those added over the past 12 months.","In-flight magazine Let's Go appears to show Manchester in Lake District .

"A crucified cat has been found strung up to a wooden cross with a biblical verse carved into it- outside a church. The horrifying discovery was made outside the Real Life Christian Church, in Lake County, Florida by an employee. The dead feline was tied to the cross - which was mounted to the west of the church - with what appeared to be pink ribbon. Along the length of the cross, a chilling handwritten message had been carved into the wood. Scroll down for video . A dead cat was discovered mounted to a cross with a biblical message scrawled across it outside a Lake County church in Florida . Taken from the bible, the verse  reads: 'Thou shalt not make my father's house a den of thieves. Matthew 7:3, ye hypocrites.' 'It's horrific. I wouldn't have imagined anything like that in this town,' Rudolph Estrada told Wesh. Police were called to the church at just after 7am last Sunday, February 1. Church leaders have condemned the cruel act and said they were praying for whoever  carried it out. 'We are truly saddened by this inhumane act against one of God's creatures,' they said. 'While we have no idea what would prompt someone to do something like this, we are praying for them and for those affected by it.' Churchgoer Yvonne Marchione who lives near to the Real Life Church, which recently received a $1.4 million donation to run its food pantry and outreach programs to refurbish homes for the poor and elderly, told News 13: 'It's hideous, it's disgusting that someone would do that,' she said. Surveillance cameras mounted around the church were not able to capture the person or people responsible. Police in Lake County have launched an investigation into the grisly crime but confirmed that no arrests had been made. The cross had a bible verse from Matthew 7:3 which read 'thou shalt not make my father's house a den of thieves' The cat was found by an employee with Real Life Christian Church who discovered it mounted on the cross on the west side of the building .","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Australian's sun safety has been slipping with a new survey revealing that 430,000 more adults are getting sunburnt on the weekend than they were four years ago. The findings, from Cancer Council's National Sun Survey which looked at the sun protection habits of 5000  Australian adults, estimated that about 2.4 million people are getting sunburnt on an average summer's weekend across the country. Craig Sinclair, Cancer Council's Chair of Public Health Committee and an expert on skin cancer prevention, told Daily Mail Australia that the reason for the increase in complacency for excessive exposure to UV was due to a lack of national skin cancer awareness campaigns. THe Cancer Council 's National Sun Survey looked at the sun protection habits of 5000 Australian adults . 'We haven't had a national sun protection campaign for over five years, so part of this reason for the increase could be very well attributed to this fact,' Mr Sinclair said. 'We know our cancer campaigns are effective in motivating behaviour change, particularly in people covering their body and hat wearing. 'There is a direct correlation and this data is clearly a call to action for more government investment in public campaigns.' Mr Sinclair said that the government had an incentive to raise awareness through prevention programs, as sun cancer leads to almost one million doctor visitations each year. Sun cancer leads to almost one million doctor visitations each year and more than 11 thousand Australians are diagnosed with melanoma each year . 'Sun cancer is the most expensive burden of all cancers,' he said. 'In terms of cost to the public health system, but also in terms of human costs: the 11 thousand plus Australians who are getting diagnosed with melanoma each year.' The survey also found that men were more likely to get sunburnt than women and neglect protecting their skin, with 18 per cent getting sunburnt on the weekend compared to 12 per cent of women. 'We haven't had a national sun protection campaign for over five years, so part of this reason for the increase could be very well attributed to this fact,' Craig Sinclair, Cancer Council's Chair of Public Health Committee and an expert on skin cancer prevention, said . 'We can't explain that exactly, maybe it's because they spend more time outdoors than women, maybe they're more inclined to wear less or have less regard for skin protection,' Mr Sinclair said. 'But it is a concern as it will undoubtedly lead to higher melanoma rates for men than women.' The Cancer Council encourages people to minimise their UV exposure by wearing appropriate clothing and sunscreen and recognising that the first signs of sunburn can occur within 15 minutes in the sun.","At least 430,000 more adults across Australia are getting sunburnt on the weekend than they were four years ago .

Shoots for high fashion magazines Love and Vogue quickly followed for the fledgling clothes horse, who is represented by Ford Models. Her famous friendship haven't hurt either. Hailey can count several public figures as her nearesr and dearest, including model-of-the-moment, Kendall Jenner. The pair have been friends for years, having both grown up in Los Angeles, and Hailey has often featured as an unknown friend of Kendall and Kylie on Keeping Up With The Kardashians. She attends all Hollywood events with her best friend, and they can often be seen partying on social media with the likes of Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez and Gigi Hadid. Hailey, centre, pictured with Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, is one of Hollywood's coolest young stars . Her close friendship with Justin Bieber, pictured together on New Year's Eve, has also made headlines . The star is  loved by fashion insiders for her relaxed sense of style, perfect pout and is a talented ballerina . Her close friendship with Justin Bieber has also made headlines - and boosted her Instagram followers to the million mark. The pair spent New Year's Eve together and were pictured getting close in Justin's swimming pool, which fuelled rumours among his loyal fans. However, after much speculation that Hailey and Bieber have grown close, it has been reported by TMZ they they are just friends, and that Justin is not dating either Hailey or Kendal, who he has also been linked to. The site claimed that Justin, who has gained a reputation as a bit of a troublemaker over the past few years, likes to spend time with the girls 'because they're relatively drama free and positive'. A source added that together 'they go to church, restaurants, concerts and clubs, but it's not romantic'. Either way, the much publicised friendship hasn't hurt her reputation. The star, who is also loved by fashion insiders for her relaxed sense of style, is a talented ballerina and has previously admitted that she hasn't ruled out a career in dance. She has also spoken about her desire to branch out into fashion design and has already designed a top for American label, Brandy Melville USA. Watch your back, Cara Delevingne.

"Three Canadian men, including one who may have already been killed while fighting alongside militants in the Middle East, have been charged in an extensive terrorism investigation. Khadar Khalib, 23, Awso Peshdary, 25, and John Maguire, who is 20 if still alive, are suspected of aiding ISIS fighters and plotting a domestic attack. Peshdary was arrested in Ottawa on Tuesday morning while warrants are out for Maguire and Khalib, who are believed to be at large fighting with ISIS in Syria or Iraq. Khadar Khalib, 23, Awso Peshdary, 25, (pictured above) and John Maguire, who is 20 if still alive, are suspected of aiding ISIS fighters and plotting a domestic attack . 'Through each terrorist-related charge we lay and each arrest we make, we send a message, which illustrates our strong resolve to root out terrorist threats,' Royal Canadian Mounted Police Chief Superintendent Jennifer Strachan told a news conference. The national security investigation which led to the arrest warrants being issued has been dubbed Project Servant. It began in December 2012, the month Maguire left Canada to participate in the civil war in Syria, and culminated on January 21, 2015. Peshdary of Ottawa has been charged with participation in the activity of a terrorist group and with facilitating an activity for a terrorist group. It is believed he financed other young men’s travel to join the Islamic State. A senior police official said Peshdary was the subject of a prior terror investigation but there was not enough evidence to arrest him at the time. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak ahead of the planned announcement Tuesday. The Associated Press first released details of the arrest and charges against the three men. Charges have also been laid in absentia against Khalib and Maguire. Khalib is charged with leaving Canada to participate in the activities of a terrorist group, and counselling a person to participate in an activity of a terrorist group. Police have charged Maguire with facilitating an activity for a terrorist group. Khalib is charged with leaving Canada to participate in the activities of a terrorist group, and counselling a person to participate in an activity of a terrorist group . Police have charged Maguire with facilitating an activity for a terrorist group . All three are also charged with conspiring to participate or to contribute in an activity of a terrorist group. Last month, Ottawa confirmed that it was investigating reports that Maguire, who also uses the name Abu Anwar Al-Canadi, was killed in northern Syria while fighting alongside ISIS militants. A pro-ISIS Twitter account reported that Maguire had been killed in the city of Kobani, which has been hammered in recent weeks by coalition airstrikes. A video posted online last December showed Maguire encouraging attacks on Canadian soil, similar to those carried out in October in Ottawa and St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec. On Tuesday, RCMP said despite the reports of Maguire’s death, the force has not seen any credible evidence to confirm that he had died. Chief Supt. Jennifer Strachan said Maguire travelled to Turkey in December 2012 and is confirmed to be a member of ISIS. Notices have been sent out through Interpol. Canada is taking part in the U.S.-led campaign against Islamic State extremists in Iraq and Syria. The RCMP said in October it was tracking about 90 individuals who could pose a danger in Canada or abroad, and vowed to make more arrests.","Khadar Khalib, 23, Awso Peshdary, 25, and John Maguire, 20, are suspected of aiding ISIS fighters and plotting a domestic attack .

"A company has developed tracking devices for towels that alert managers to the whereabouts of their linen at all times. The concept was initially designed to help keep an eye on linen as it left  hotels to be cleaned, but it is now proving a powerful preventative measure for robe raiders. The new technology may be bad news for opportunistic thieves, but it's good news for hoteliers who lose up to 20 per cent of their linen every month. Linen Tracking Technology has designed a chip that alert hotel managers to the whereabouts of their linen . Most losses are though wear and tear, but two per cent are through theft, estimates William Serbin, executive vice president of Linen Tracking Technology, the company behind the tracking chip. If you've  stolen a towel or robe from a hotel room, you are far from alone. A poll by myvouchercodes.co.uk found that 68 per cent of Britons cannot resist taking a towel or item of linen when they check out of a hotel. That number is set to plummet, as 2,000 hotels now use the tracking technology although William Serbin won't name which. He told MailOnline: 'Our properties like to remain anonymous. They benefit from the gained efficiency and don’t want to alarm guests that they have this technology.' He revealed while there are no UK hotels currently using the chips  they plan to enter the UK market as soon as they find a partner and gain a license. 2,000 hotels use radio frequency tracking in linen although company chief William Serbin won't name which . Linen Technology Tracking, a Miami-based company, has patented the chip  which, once inserted allows managers to real-time track each and every towel using UHF Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. A poll found 68% of Brits steal linen from hotels . The tiny chip send signals to antennae positioned at the hotel's entrance or exit, letting owners know if a towel has left the property. Towels are bendable, chips last up to 300 washes and tags can be read by sensors up to six feet away. As well as catching guests out, they are helpful for housekeeping if they want to find out when a towel has been removed from the wardrobe, so it can be restocked. William says, 'Our solution not only provides total inventory information, but provides additional data like dwell time, wash count and laundry reconciliation which assists properties become more efficient.' He estimates that, although each property is different, most save about $50,000 (£33,300) a year in lost linen. Although Linen Technology Tracking does not tell hoteliers the exact coordinates of a missing towel or robe, several thieves have successfully been  asked to return pilfered hotel property. 'It's been phenomenal,' William also told CNN. 'The chips create a lot of conversation. When my friends travel, they'll call and ask, 'Are you guys at my hotel?'","Linen Tracking Technology has developed a chip so hotels can track linen .

"A mother has been accused of Tasering her teenage son because he talked back to her. Rhonda Gulsen, 54, was arrested last Friday and charged with third-degree felony child abuse, according to the Flagler County Sheriff's Office. The 15-year-old boy was allegedly left with two burn marks on his arm during the attack by his mother in Florida. Rhonda Gulsen, 54, was arrested last Friday, according to the Flagler County Sheriff's Office in Florida . Gulsen allegedly Tasered the boy in the upper left arm with a stun gun at around 4pm at his grandparents' house.

"Losing your keys is bad enough, but having to replace the entire lock because you don’t have a key to copy makes things even worse - not to mention expensive. The KeyMe app promises to take the hassle and cost out of this by letting you store photos of your keys online, and order duplicates in the post. Alternatively, the US service has kiosks that let you copy keys in an emergency, or share photos with a locksmith in person. KeyMe is a New York-based digital locksmith. The app lets homeowners scan (pictured left) and store their keys in the cloud (pictured right), share these scans with family and friends, and order duplicates in the post. KeyMe is free on iOS but is only currently available in the US . KeyMe is free on iOS but is currently only available in the US. The New York-based startup is looking to expand the service, and an Android version of the app is in development. After setting up an account, homeowners use their smartphone camera to take a photo of each side of the key. The photo must be taken on a white background, from a distance of up to 4 inches (10cm), in order to avoid what the app calls ‘fly-by’ scans. After setting up an account,  homeowners use their smartphone camera to take a photo of each side of the key. The photo has to be taken on a white background, from to 4 inches (10cm) away, in order to avoid what the app calls ‘fly-by’ scans. Once a key is successfully scanned and stored, users can send their digital keychain to friends, family and housemates over email. The owner and recipient can then order duplicates from within the app. Storing keys is free, but the cost of ordering duplicates depends on the type of key being copied, with prices starting at $10 (£6). Alternatively, photos can be used by physical locksmiths to create copies, or users can print keys from KeyMe kiosks. This doesn’t, in theory, protect people from criminals taking photos of other people's keys though. However, KeyMe does notify users whenever there is activity on their account, but this only applies if a potential thief is using that person’s account. It is unknown whether KeyMe can recognise if the same key is scanned and added to a different account. As an extra security measure, however, the app requires user verification, a credit card, a verified mailing address and an Apple-verified device and ID to purchase a key. Michael Harbolt, vice president of marketing at KeyMe told MailOnline that if a thief, hypothetically, did want to steal a key and order a new one using the app, they 'would then have to use an Apple registered device, Apple ID and wireless carrier to download the app and provide user verification to access the app. '[They] would then have to provide a valid credit card to purchase these keys and a  mailing address. All of the data provided during this exchange could be used to easily identify [them].' As an alternative, Mr Harbolt explained that a thief could 'simply walk down to a local locksmith and get a copy made by paying cash' without providing any method of identification. 'Given a choice of the these two options - one where you can easily be identified, and one where there is no risk of being identified - as a criminal, which option are you more likely to pursue when attempting to commit a crime?,' continued Mr Harbolt. In terms of protecting the keys stored in the cloud, the company said: ‘We use commercial grade security to protect your key data. ‘Additionally, we do not store any personally identifiable information except for an email address and password.’ But, these security concerns only apply to ordering keys in the post. If a key is ordered from a locksmith in person, the user can verify their identity by having the phone, app and another form of physical ID. Once a key is successfully scanned and stored, users can send their digital keychain to friends, family and housemates over email (illustrated). The owner and recipient can then order duplicates from within the app. Storing keys is free, but the cost depends on the type of key being copied, with prices starting at $10 (£6) Alternatively, photos can be used by physical locksmiths to create copies. To order a key from a locksmith, the app produces a code (pictured) that the locksmith can use to create the duplicate. This code reveals the type of key, as well as its 'biting' code, which gives details about the shape and cut of the key .

KeyMe sends an email confirmation when the recipient has accepted the key, but shared keys can’t be deactivated. The owner and recipient can then order duplicates from within the app. Storing keys is free, but the cost of ordering duplicates depends on the type of key being copied.

"Some residents of one of Manhattan's wealthiest neighborhoods have voted to nix current plans for a handicap access path in order to preserve their views of the East River. What's more, the new plan that Upper East Siders have approved will force some wheelchair-bound to traverse an additional block for access to the East River esplanade walkway, one that includes a dangerously busy parking garage. The move preserves the panoramic river view  for residents of the apartment tower at 45 East River Avenue, where apartments can fetch up to $3 million, the New York Post reports. Vetoed: A proposed wheelchair ramp (rendering pictured) would block panoramic East River views for some Upper East Side residents in New York, so they voted to move it . Danger: The new proposal will force the wheelchair-bound to traverse an extra block that includes this dangerously busy parking garage . There currently exists just a crumbling set of stairs connecting a raised walkway and public park with the East River walkway down below. In order to update those stairs and make them accessible for the handicapped, the city has proposed a new, fenced walkway that would stretch some 450 feet. That most notably puts it directly in front of the posh 45 East End Avenue Co-Op, where one 30-year-old resident told the Post: . 'I would look outside of my window and feel like a mouse in a laboratory...The view of the water would be ruined for a lot of people.' Improvements: Currently there is only this non-accessible bridge and set of decaying stairs . Regulations require that the walkway, which will extend above busy FDR Drive--a highway extending up the length of Manhattan's East Side--be lined by a fence to ensure nothing is thrown onto the roadway. Resident of the local community board have suggested the chain-link be replaced with plexiglass. However, city planners fear that, while preserving the view, a plastic barrier would be susceptible to vandalism and decay. Groundbreaking is scheduled to take place on the ramp this spring, with a completion date projected for June 2016, according to A Walk in the Park. Pricey: Most affected by the view-obstructing bridge would have been residents of this building, where an apartment currently for sale has an asking price of $2.8 million .","Along the East River in one of Manhattan's wealthiest neighborhoods, residents have voted to move the bridge a block north to 82nd Street .

"A pilot who crashed his plane into a mountainside after he was overcome with grief at losing one of his sons has miraculously survived with just scratches - and credits his son with saving his life. Mark Darling was flying alone from Baggs, Wyoming, to Greeley, Colorado on January 25 when he flew over Steamboat Springs, Colorado - where he raised his family - and thought of his son, Travis, who was just 23 when he was killed in a car crash in October 2012. Darling, 55, made a split-second decision to end his life. 'I make a bad decision at this point,' he told KCNC. 'I turn the airplane east toward the mountains. I say my last goodbyes... I closed my eyes and I wait for the impact.' Scroll down for video . Lucky escape: Mark Darling was overcome with grief about the death of his son as he flew his plane in Colorado last month and tried to take his life by crashing the plane - but he survived without a scratch . But it never came. Instead, he felt as the Cessna 172F high-wing plane cruised through trees and crumpled at it landed in the snow, miraculously leaving him without a scratch. He found himself stranded on the snow-covered mountain without any survival equipment. He had also not logged a flight plan so no one would have known where to look when he failed to return. Despite his earlier death wish, he said he suddenly felt determination to survive - because he heard his son speak to him. 'He's like, ""Dad, you are not going out like this"",' he recalled. '""You're going to get yourself up and you're going to build a fire and you're going to get yourself out of here"".' He reached for his phone but could not find it anywhere in the wreckage. Loss: Darling's 23-year-old son Travis, pictured left and right, was killed in a car crash in October 2012 . Wreckage: Darling's plan was destroyed when he hit the mountain - but he did not suffer a single injury . At that point, his son spoke to him again and guided him to the other side of the plane, where he found his phone in the snow, he said. He called his sister and 911, and set up a fire as he waited for emergency responders. Seven hours after he crashed, eight members of Routt County Search and Rescue rode snowmobiles to him and took him to hospital. The NTSB is investigating the crash and Darling, who is married with three other sons and a daughter, has not yet spoken to investigators. His son Travis was killed in 2012 after his pickup went off the road near Rockdale, Texas and rolled over. The accomplished rodeo cowboy had moved to the area just a week before to start a new job on a ranch, according to an article in Steamboat Today. Saved: He says his son's voice guided him to his cell phone and he called family and 911. Seven hours after the crash, emergency responders reached him and stretchered him to safety, pictured . Despite the ramifications of speaking out publicly about his story, Mark Darling said he is now inspired to share the tale of survival with other people who are grieving. 'I've never felt more alive in my life,' he said. 'I don't know what direction it's going to lead me in but, heck yeah, I'm along for the ride now.'

"Jaleel Tariq Abdul-Jabbaar, 46, has pleaded guilty to a single felony for making an interstate threat against the life of former Ferguson, Mo., police Officer Darren Wilson and his family . An ISIS sympathizer in Washington state has pleaded guilty to a single felony for making an interstate threat against the life of former Ferguson, Missouri, police Officer Darren Wilson and his family. Jaleel Tariq Abdul-Jabbaar, 46, entered the plea on Monday morning in Seattle. Two other counts are set to be dismissed at sentencing, which is set for June 12. Abdul-Jabbaar had been detained in custody since his arrest on December 2, but will now be released under supervision until his next court appearance. If convicted, the father-of-three faces a maximum of five years in prison. Abdul-Jabbaar started writing the messages immediately after Wilson shot Michael Brown dead last August. 'We need to kill this white motha f***a and anything that has a badge on,’ he wrote on Facebook, where he displayed an ISIS flag as his cover photo. In addition to specific social media threats, he is also accused of trying to acquire a firearm to act out his desire as spokesman of 'the oppressed' who 'need to kill this white cop.' In one threat that dates from November 24, the day the grand jury declined to charge Wilson, Abdul-Jabbaar uploaded a photograph of the officer to his Facebook page with the message, 'Ready to go and kill some cops.' He followed that up later in the day with, 'We need to kill this white motha F***a and anything that has a badge on.' Murderous support: Abdul-Jabbaar displayed the flag of ISIS on his Facebook page - onto which he posted chilling threats towards Officer Darren Wilson . Threats: Abdul-Jabbaar is accused of posting a string of threats to his personal Facebook page targeting police officers, specifically Wilson. The criminal complaint quoted one of the postings as saying: 'We the oppressed people need to kill this white cop' The next day there was a cartoon depicting a black man killing a white officer, with the message: 'We black folks should've been doing this to the police last night.' In a November 11 Facebook post Abdul-Jabbaar wrote, 'Are there any REAL BLACK MEN that would love to go down to Ferguson Missouri to give back those bullets that [Wilson] fired into the body of Mike Brown.' The message ends, 'If we're unable to locate [Wilson] then We'll return them to his wife and if not her then his children.' In other, shocking posts to his Facebook page, Abdul-Jabbaar says that he 'would love to smoke a white motha f***'n cop.' Born William Cox, Abdul-Jabbaar changed his name in 1990 after converting to Islam and has been divorced several times. He has several prior convictions, including selling crack cocaine, domestic violence, weapons possession and assault. In addition to specific social media threats, he is also accused of trying to acquire a firearm to act out his desire as spokesman of 'the oppressed' who 'need to kill this white cop' Abdul-Jabbaar started writing the threatening messages immediately after Officer Wilson, left, shot Michael Brown, right, dead last August . Abdul-Jabbaar was also once found guilty of drugging and having 'indecent contact' with an underage girl who was suffering mental illness. His last appearance in a court came in 2008 when he was sentenced to a year in prison following a gunfight with another man. A sealed court document contends that Abdul-Jabbaar's sentenced may have been lessened by his cooperation with federal authorities in giving evidence against two al-Qaeda operatives who opened a training camp in Oregon in 1997. While Abdul-Jabbaar had no involvement with the camp, his attorney at the time said that his client wanted to help authorities in their case against the two men who are now in custody. Discoverd: Federal prosecutors said Abdul-Jabbaar's online postings went beyond free and protected speech . Action: Defendant Jaleel Tarik Abdul-Jabbaar, 46, of Kirkland began posting threats on Facebook soon after the shooting of Michael Brown, according to the criminal complaint. Shocking: Federal prosecutors said Abdul-Jabbaar posted inflammatory messages for months that called on others to join him on a trip to Ferguson to 'give back the bullets' that were fired at Brown .","Jaleel Tariq Abdul-Jabbaar, 46, has pleaded guilty to a single felony for making an interstate threat against  Officer Darren Wilson and his family .

"A high school teacher was left covered in blood last week after he was punched by a male student over a perceived racist remark. The teacher at Forestville High in Maryland, who was not identified by officials but named as James Hemmen on social media, suffered minor injuries after being attacked by the teen. The school characterized the incident last Thursday as a 'misinterpretation of a comment' during class but some students and parents said the teacher made a racially-insensitive remark. Scroll down for video . A teacher (pictured) was left covered in blood last week following an attack by a student over a perceived racist remark at Forestville High School in Maryland . Prince George's County Public Schools told Daily Mail Online on Tuesday that the district was unable to comment on the consequences related to the incident to protect student and teacher confidentiality. The student is to be disciplined for the attack, according to NBC, with authorities adding that this was an isolated incident and there was no need to increase security at the school. It was not clear on Tuesday if the student would face criminal charges over the attack. According to a school district spokeswoman: 'On January 29, a misinterpretation of a comment in a classroom at Forestville High School resulted in an assault against a teacher. 'The teacher was treated for injuries at a local medical facility and released. School administrators and security staff are working together to investigate the incident. 'Prince George’s County Public Schools (PGCPS) is committed to ensuring a safe and supportive environment in all schools.

The Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering has shared a list of celebrities who have studied engineering, including Ashton Kutcher (pictured) with MailOnline, to highlight the breadth of appeal ofthe discipline . For example, Cindy Crawford studied chemical engineering at Northwestern University, Illinois, before taking to the catwalk, while Teri Hatcher, studied mathematics and engineering at De Anza College, California, before playing Lois Lane in The New Adventures of Superman and later, Susan in Desperate Housewives. Ashton Kutcher studied biochemical engineering. While the subject may have not have prepared him for his acting career - aside perhaps from playing Steve Jobs - it may have stood him in good stead for his interest in tech start-ups. The actor has so far successfully invested in companies such as Foursquare Skype, Airbnb, Spotify and yPlan.

Before becoming the 108th Mayor of New York City and a business magnate, Michael Bloomberg studied electrical engineering. Actor Donald Sutherland, the son of an engineer, studied the same subject and Swedish Actor Dolph Lundgren who is known for his roles in action movies, has a degree in chemical engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, followed by a master's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Sydney in Sydney. Footballer Dennis Bergkamp studied mechanical engineering at University of Bath . His first big break came in Rocky IV and he has recently starred alongside Sylvester Stallone and other action stars in The Expendables film franchise. And it is not just actors that set their sights on becoming engineers. Footballer Dennis Bergkamp studied mechanical engineering at University of Bath, while Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, was a software and telecommunications engineer, before drawing his famous comic strips. Tom Scholz, founder of rock band Boston, studied mechanical engineering at MIT and holds a number of patents, while Herbie Hancock, a jazz musician, studied electrical engineering. A number of celebrities have expressed an interest in become more technically-minded too. For example, Will.i.am has said that he would like to study computer science and has recently launched a smart watch, while model Karlie Kloss, recently participated in ‘Hour of Code’ to encourage people to learn how to create their own computer programmes. Despite more people keen to build their own apps and a widespread interest in green technology, for example, there is a major shortage of engineers. In the UK alone, 1.82 million new engineering, science and technology professionals will be needed by 2022, for example. The Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering, which has been likened to a ‘Nobel’ for engineering, aims to raise the public profile of engineering. The £1 million prize has this afternoon been awarded to chemical engineer Robert Langer for his revolutionary advances in the fields of chemistry and medicine.

The 2015 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering has been awarded to the ground-breaking chemical engineer Dr Robert Langer for his revolutionary advances in the fields of chemistry and medicine. Dr Langer has over 1,000 issued and pending patents, over 200 major prizes to his name, and  is the most cited engineer in history. A chemical engineer by training, Dr Langer was the first person to engineer polymers to control the delivery of large molecular weight drugs for the treatment of diseases such as cancer and mental illness. The 2015 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering has been awarded to the ground-breaking chemical engineer Dr Robert Langer (pictured) for his revolutionary advances in the fields of chemistry and medicine . His unconventional thinking toppled the established view that controlled-release drug delivery would not work for large molecules like proteins, which are very sensitive to their surroundings. Dr Langer's work has helped lay the foundation for a myriad of health innovations, including the long-lasting brain cancer treatment called Giladel Wafer and the prostate cancer and endometriosis treatments Lupron Depot, Zoladex, and Decapeptyl SR. He is also behind the schizophrenia treatment Respirdal Consta, the diabetes treatment Bydureon and the drug-coated cardiovascular stents that alone have benefited 10 million heart patients. His laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge - with over 100 students, postdoctoral students, and visiting scientists at any one time - is the world's largest academic biomedical engineering laboratory. One of Dr Langer’s most recent projects is a microchip-based implant capable of storing and releasing precise doses of a drug on-demand or at scheduled intervals for up to 16 years. The QEPrize is a global £1million prize that celebrates the engineers responsible for a ground-breaking innovation that has been of global benefit to humanity.

"A new documentary about childhood obesity in the United States is set to lift the lid on the struggles that the country's increasing number of overweight youngsters face on a daily basis, from dealing with bullies to battling against life-threatening health problems. Bite Size, which is due to be released via video streaming service VOD on March 10, chronicles the stories of four obese kids as they try to work their way towards a healthier goal weight by 'learning how to be active and stay happy'. 'Bite Size showcases the stories of four inspiring kids from diverse backgrounds who are fighting for their health one day at a time,' the film's description explains. 'Proving that it’s not just about the number on a scale, what really matters is learning what keeps you active and makes you happy.' Scroll down for video . 'I crush it': Keanna, 13, admits that she has an unhealthy relationship with food and says that she tends to 'eat rapidly and eat everything' Shut-in: 11-year-old Moy's father accuses him of 'eating his life away' because he prefers sitting in front of his computer at home to being outside . Getting an education: Emily, 13, has spent a length of time at 'weight loss school' and admits that she fears she will return to the weight that she was before she started turning her life around (pictured) Keep on moving: Davion, 12, is a big football fan, and confesses that he is determined to try and make the team . According to the American Heart Association, 'one in three American kids is overweight', with more and more children being diagnosed as obese each and every day - a health crisis which the producers of Bite Size want to highlight. In a newly-released trailer for the documentary, viewers are introduced to its four stars - Keanna, 13, Moy, 11, Emily 13, and Davion, 12, all of whom have been diagnosed as clinically obese. Throughout the trailer, each of children shares their views on their weight, detail how they are going about getting down to a healthier size - and what negative impact their obesity has had on their lifestyle. 'For me to be a big person, I can run pretty fast,' Davion, who suffers from diabetes as a result of his weight, tells the camera. 'I'm football material, but my legs will go out on me sometimes,' he adds, as a clip of him falling to his knees while at football tryouts is played. 'I want my diabetes to go away, so that I can do whatever everybody else can do.' Struggles: The young man admits that he finds it hard to keep up with other children his age . Try and try again: Davion is incredibly determined and insists that he will keep fighting to achieve his goals - particularly when it comes to football . Targeted: The football fan admits to being picked on by bullies, who make fun of his weight . Davion goes on to reveal that his obesity has made him a target for bullies at his school, many of whom seem content to throw both verbal and physical abuse his way at any available opportunity. 'They just hate me because of who I am,' he adds. 'They just say: ""Oh, he's fat.""' But despite the abuse and torment that Davion faces, he is determined to overcome any and all obstacles put in his way - particularly when it comes to his goal of joining his school's football team. 'If I can't do it, I'm still going to try,' he insists to the camera, while trying to complete the same tackle again and again. Keanna, 13, is also on a mission to lose weight through exercise, and has taken up dance in the hopes that it will help her to live a healthier lifestyle. She admits that she has an unhealthy relationship with food, explaining that she 'eats rapidly and eats everything', suggesting that she wants not only to become more active, but to overcome her bad eating habits. Dancing queen: Keanna is using her love of dance to try and help her lose weight and become more active . A body like Beyonce: A friend of the 13 year old claims that Keanna wants to try and slim down to the same size as the popstar . Baby steps: Keanna and her family know that she will have to work hard in order to become healthier . 'Keanna and her friends want to be slim and get the Beyonce body,' a friend tells the camera. 'They all love to dance. So maybe that's the first step.' But while Keanna has found her passion - and a goal that will ensure she stays motivated to keep battling towards a healthier goal weight - 11-year-old Moy has yet to find that same passion that will get him off the couch and see him leading a more active lifestyle. 'You're eating your life away,' Moy's father is seen telling the youngster. 'You're a couch potato.' Moy's main interest in life is his computer, which he uses to create and edit his own movies - a hobby which unfortunately sees him spending most of his time  sitting down inside. 'I love the computer,' he explains to the camera. 'Making movies is really fun.' But Moy admits that his obesity is often the subject of cruel taunts from his fellow students at school, and even confesses that he has come close to lashing out physically at the people who continue to make fun of his size. Comfort food: Moy's father accuses the youngster of spending more time at home eating than he does doing anything else . Couch potato: Moy admits that his favorite activity is making movies on his computer . Healthy and happy: Slowly but surely, the youngster learns to embrace different forms of exercise, starting with fitness-focused video games (L) and branching out to including swimming (R) 'I almost get in a fight because people keep making fun of me,' he says. Thankfully, he comes to the realization - with the help of his father - that his love of computers can also be used to help him become more active and, in turn, reach a healthier size. Towards the end of the trailer, Moy is seen using a games console-based fitness game, which encourages him to get up on his feet and get moving - all from the comfort of his living room. Emily, the documentary's fourth star, has already tackled the initial hurdles when it comes to implementing a healthier lifestyle, having already spent a length of time at 'weight loss school', which she describes as being 'like The Biggest Loser for kids'. But while she and her parents have had the benefit of expert assistance - and have already seen incredible results in terms of Emily's weight loss - the 13-year-old confesses that she feels almost more pressured to keep her weight down, than she did to lose it in the first place. Foraging for food: After spending time away at weight loss school, Emily struggles to maintain control over her diet after she returns home . Then and now: While at weight loss school, Emily slimmed down to a much healthier weight (L) and is devastated when she starts putting some of it back on again (R) Healthy and happy: The 13 year old insists that being healthy is not necessarily just about weight loss, but is rather about 'learning what keeps you active - and what makes you happy' 'People bet on who is going to gain some of the weight back,' she said of her fellow weight loss school students. 'I was a big target for who was going to fail.' Without the strict guidance of her weight loss teachers, Emily admits that she begins to put on weight, almost immediately after returning home - despite making every effort to maintain a healthy diet. 'I am a never-ending trash can,' she tells the camera, before breaking down, and adding: 'And to come back and gain some of the weight back...' But, of all the children, Emily seems to have the best understanding about what being healthy really means. 'It's not about ""weight loss"",' she says. 'It's just about learning what keeps you active - and what makes you happy.'","Bite Size follows the stories of Keanna, 13, Davion, 12, Moy, 11, and Emily, 13, all of whom are overweight .

"Pope Francis has said he is 'truly sorry' for offending  large Catholic families by saying that there was no need to breed 'like rabbits'. The Pope caused dismay among larger families last month when he cautioned 'responsible parenthood' advising that three children was 'about right'. Vatican Archbishop Giovanni Becciu has apologised on Francis' behalf by saying 'the Pope is truly sorry' that his remarks about large families 'caused such disorientation'. Anger: Francis caused dismay among larger families last month when he cautioned 'responsible parenthood' advising that three children was 'about right' Archbishop Becciu told the Italian bishop's newspaper Avvenire that the pope 'absolutely did not want to disregard the beauty and the value of large families.' Francis, himself the eldest of five children, had told a press conference on a flight back from the Philippines how a woman he knows was pregnant with her eighth child after having the first seven by C-section. Devout: Former U.S. Republican Presidential candidate Rick Santorum said it's sometimes difficult to listen to the Pope . He said he had rebuked her, saying: 'But do you want to leave seven orphans?' The Pope said: 'That is an irresponsibility. [That woman might say] 'no but I trust in God.' But God gives you methods to be responsible.' He added: 'Some think that in order to be good Catholics we have to be like rabbits. No. Responsible parenthood.' The remarks immediately provoked anger from pro-life groups who said that they were hurtful to Catholic mothers who had sacrificed careers, time and energy to care for their children. Former US Republican Presidential candidate Rick Santorum, a devout Catholic, said: 'It's sometimes very difficult to listen to the Pope and some of the things he says off the cuff, and this is one of them.'

"Jordan's King Abdullah, a trained pilot, could lead revenge airstrikes on Islamic State himself, it has been revealed. The monarch may personally take part in bombing raids on extremist strongholds on Thursday, according to reports in Arabic-language newspapers. It comes after the former general told members of Congress that he was ready to exact a blistering revenge against the ISIS terror army for the brutal execution of military pilot Moaz al-Kassasbeh - and he quoted a Clint Eastwood movie character to make his point. Scroll down for videos . Jordan's King Abdullah (pictured), a trained pilot, could lead revenge airstrikes on Islamic State himself, it has been revealed . Uncompromising language; King Abdullah of Jordan, (center), is hurried into a meeting  with leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the Capitol in Washington after shocking footage of a Jordanian pilot being burned alive was released online Tuesday . According to the dailycaller, reports have emerged suggesting he could take part in airstrikes on ISIS targets today. California Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter told the Washington Examiner that the king quoted the scene where Eastwood's character announces his plan for retribution. 'Any man I see out there, I'm gonna kill him,' Eastwood's William Munny says in 'Unforgiven.' 'Any son of a bitch takes a shot at me, I'm not only going to kill him, I'm going to kill his wife and all his friends and burn his damn house down.' 'He said there is going to be retribution like ISIS hasn't seen,' Hunter said. 'He's angry. 'They're starting more sorties tomorrow than they've ever had. They're starting tomorrow. And he said, ""The only problem we're going to have is running out of fuel and bullets"".' 'He's ready to get it on. He really is. It reminded me of how we were after 9/11. We were ready to give it to them.' Return home: King Abdullah of Jordan arrives as Jordanians stand along the way between Amman and Queen Alia airport waiting to greet him upon his arrival on Wednesday . REVENGE: 'Any son of a bitch takes a shot at me, I'm not only going to kill him, I'm going to kill his wife and all his friends and burn his damn house down,' Clint Eastwood says in 'Unforgiven,' and the King of Jordan quoted him Tuesday in response to ISIS . Last-minute meeting: Jordan's King Abdullah II (left) met with President Obama at the White House on Tuesday after video emerged showing the brutal execution of one of his country's pilots by the ISIS terrorist group . Brutal: Footage titled 'Healing the Believers Chests' appears to show captured airman Moaz al-Kassasbeh wearing an orange jumpsuit as a trail of petrol leading up to the cage is  set alight . Hunter told the Examiner that no one in the king's meeting on Tuesday with members of the House Armed Services Committee made any mention of President Obama, who is seen by some anti-ISIS coalition partners as a weak and indecisive actor. South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said after a separate meeting with the king that Jordan would have a 'strong and forceful' response to the the fiery execution. 'The Jordanian response will be more engaged, not less engaged, when it comes to destroying ISIL,' Graham said. 'The king feels that the gloves are off and that it now is time if you can't negotiate with these people, you're going to have to take it to them, and I think it's going to be more than Jordan.' Obama and Abdullah met Tuesday evening in a hastily arranged meeting just hours after a grisly video emerged showing al-Kassasbeh, who was 26 years old, being burned alive in a cage by ISIS. They emerged from the meeting, vowing to continue their fight of the extremist group gaining control over large swathes of Iraq and Syria. In addition, the State Department said Tuesday that the administration will increase its annual aid to Jordan to $1 billion from $660 million to help it pay for the cost of housing refugees from Iraq and Syria – and provide new resources to fight ISIS. An agreement on the aid will require congressional approval. In a brief statement, the U.S. State Department said it planned to provide $1 billion per year to Jordan for each of the U.S. fiscal years for 2015, 2016 and 2017. The U.S. fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. Activists carry pictures of Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kassasbeh in Amman on February 3, 2015 . Captured: Muath al-Kasasbeh (centre in white) was captured by the Islamic State after after crashing near its HQ in the Syrian city of Raqqa in December. ISIS is now believed to brutally murdered him . Al-Kassasbeh was captured in December when his F-16 jet crashed over northern Syria, a mission that was part of the U.S.-led coalition campaign against the jihadists. During the meeting, President Obama offered 'his deepest condolences' to the king over the pilot's death . 'The president and King Abdullah reaffirmed that the vile murder of this brave Jordanian will only serve to steel the international community's resolve to destroy ISIL,' said White House spokesman Alistair Baskey. Obama earlier decried the 'cowardice and depravity' of the Islamic State, saying the brutal killing would only strengthen international resolve to destroy the extremists. The White House would not speculate on whether the video was released to coincide with Abdullah's visit to Washington, where he was not scheduled to meet Obama. The president said First Lieutenant Kassasbeh's 'dedication, courage and service to his country' represented 'universal human values that stand in opposition to the cowardice and depravity of ISIL.' 'Today, we join the people of Jordan in grieving the loss of one of their own,' the president added, as his administration reaffirmed its intention to give Jordan $3 billion in security aid over the next three years. 'As we grieve together, we must stand united, respectful of his sacrifice to defeat this scourge,' Obama said after the latest in a wave of grizzly filmed murders. Jordanian state television said that Kassasbeh was killed on January 3. The slaying would redouble international commitment to ensure the Islamic State group 'are degraded and ultimately defeated,' said Obama. The extremists seized swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria last year, declaring an Islamic 'caliphate' and committing a wave of atrocities. Countries as diverse as the United States, Saudi Arabia and Jordan responded with 'Operation Inherent Resolve,' an air-led campaign to pummel the jihadist group. US Central Command meanwhile admitted that the Islamic State still had the ability 'to conduct small-scale operations,' despite months of air strikes. But, it said, 'their capacity to do so is degraded and their momentum is stalling.' Attacks have hit the group's 'ability to command and control forces; recruit, train and retain fighters, produce revenue from oil sales, and maintain morale.' Islamic State had offered to spare Kassasbeh's life and free a Japanese journalist in return for the release of a female would-be suicide bomber on death row in Jordan. Jordanian officials announced the female bomber and other jihadists would be executed on Wednesday.","Jordan's King Abdullah II quoted film character saying 'I'm not only going to kill him, I'm going to kill his wife and all his friends and burn his damn house down'

"An Ohio businessman who sold fake urine and other products designed to help people pass drug tests pleaded guilty in front of a federal judge in Pennsylvania. David Neal of Middletown began selling illegal substances online in 2006 with his company ACS Herbal Tea via websites like www.123zip.com and www.passthetest.com. ACS Herbal Tea sold products like 'Magnum Unisex Synthetic Urine-Never Fail a Urine Drug Test'. 'Urine Luck', 'Eliminator Detox Carbo Drink' and 'Quick Flush Herbal Detox Pills'. David Neal's company ACS Herbal Tea sold products (pictured) via websites like www.123zip.com and www.passthetest.com that were meant to help people pass workplace drug tests. The 61-year-old Ohio man pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States in federal court in Pittsburgh yesterday . The 61-year-old man pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States and introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce when he appeared before Chief United States District Judge Joy Flowers Conti in Pittsburgh yesterday. Neal faces up to six years in prison, a fine of $350,000, or both, when he returns for sentencing on May 13. The court was advised that Neal used ACS Herbal Tea to defraud the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) of the United States Department of Heath and Human Services. He did this by 'obstructing and interfering with the lawful governmental functions of SAMHSA in overseeing, monitoring and establishing scientific and technical guidelines for federal workplace drug testing programs'. Such tests are used to screen airline pilots, truck drivers and train engineers, as well as some federal employees such as FBI agents. The illegal products Neal sold would have thrown off the results of urine tests (pictured)  used to screen airline pilots, truck drivers, train engineers and federal employees like FBI agents . Court records indicate undercover agents bought some of the products in 2010 and 2012 as part of the investigation into Neal's company. Neal's attorney, Paul Laufman, told Judge Conti his client now realizes the products he was selling were 'not as harmless as he thought', the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported. A former US Airways Express pilot who pleaded guilty to similar charges in 2010, Stephen Sharp, was sentenced to nine months in federal prison. Neal was released on an unsecured $10,000 bond before sentencing.","David Neal of Middletown pleaded guilty to two charges in court on Monday .

"Scientists have discovered what may be the oldest species on the planet - a deep sea organism that has remained unchanged for more than two billion years. The microscopic bacteria were found living in mud off the west coast of South America and appear to be identical to fossils found in rocks in Western Australia. Researchers believe the filament-like microorganisms have survived unchanged by living off the sulphurous compounds in sediments that were first laid down around 2.3 billion years ago. Scroll down for video . The scientists compared bacteria found living off the coast of South America (far left and centre) with similar fossils of organisms found in rocks in Western Australia that were once under the ocean two billion years ago . They believe the bacteria first evolved during the early Proterozoic eon of the Earth, just after the continents first stabilised and before an oxygen levels in the atmosphere increased. Fossils believed to be the oldest organisms to have lived on Earth also lived in what is now Western Australia. Palaeontologists discovered the preserved remains of microscopic bacteria that lived around 3.43 billion years ago. At the time the Earth would have been a hot, hostile environment without oxygen. The bacteria would have thrived on the sulphur spewed out by the highly active volcanoes at the time. Their fossils, which are too small to see with the naked eye, were found nestled between grains of sand on the world’s oldest beach in Strelley Pool, in the remote Pilbara region of Western Australia. Some experts believe the world's oldest fossilised forms of life are stromatolites - unusual rocky structures that occur in shallow water. They claim these formed as the result of clumps of bacteria that excreted crystal layers to protect themselves around 3.5 billion years ago. However, this is highly controversial and some scientists claim these were formed through chemical processes. The scientists behind the research say their discovery also helps to support a central tenet in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution - that if there is no change in the physical environment of a well-adapted organism, its biology will remain unchanged. Professor William Schopf, a palaeobiologist at the University of California Los Angeles who led the research, said: 'It seems astounding that life has not evolved for more than 2 billion years—nearly half the history of the Earth. 'These microorganisms are well-adapted to their simple, very stable physical and biological environment.' The international team of researchers, whose work is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, examined preserved fossils of ancient deep-sea bacteria that lived in the ocean mud off that now forms part of Western Australia around 1,800 million years ago. These fossils, found in an area now known as Duck Creek, close to Nanutarra, Western Australia, were found to be identical to another fossilised bacterial community that lived 500 million years earlier in what is now Turee Creek, in Karijini National Park, Western Australia. These were compared to modern microbes found living in mud off the coasts of Chile, Peru, the Galapagos Archipielago, Ecuador, Panama and Costa Rica by researchers from the University of Concepción in Chile. The scientists concluded that the modern bacteria were identical to the fossilised organisms found off the coast of Australia. This suggests the species was hugely successful around two billion years ago, flourishing in the sulphur rich environments that emerged before oxygen levels increased around the globe. The dark areas in this section of 1.8 billion year old rock are fossilised bacteria that have been found to be identical to microorganisms found living in the deep sea much off the west coast of South America . The fossilised bacteria were found in ancient rocks in Duck Creek and Turee Creek in Western Australia . The fossils in this rock, marked by dark areas, are at least two billion years old, according to researchers . They say as bacteria capable of photosynthesis, which uses the power of the sun to react carbon dioxide with water to produce oxygen, started to increase oxygen levels, the sulphur loving bacteria were able to survive deep in the oxygen poor environments of the deep ocean floor. Professor Schopf said that it was likely the molecular biology of these organisms would be very similar as the environments they lived have remained largely unchanged. The researchers used several techniques to analyze the fossils, including Raman spectroscopy — which enables scientists to look inside rocks to determine their composition and chemistry — and confocal laser scanning microscopy — which renders fossils in 3-D. Living bacteria identical to the fossils were found in deep sea mud along the west coast of South America . Professor Schopf said that it would be necessary to examine other ancient bacterial fossils from similar environments to see whether the organisms there had changed at all. He said: 'Such findings may eventually be regarded as having confirmed the null hypothesis required of Darwinian evolution, but such an assessment would be, at present, premature. 'If they were in an environment that did not change but they nevertheless evolved, that would have shown that our understanding of Darwinian evolution was seriously flawed. 'The rule of biology is not to evolve unless the physical or biological environment changes, which is consistent with Darwin.'","Microscopic fossils found in Western Australia found to be identical to bacteria living in deep sea mud off the west coast of South America .

"A man who spent months sleeping in a lakeside trailer and days attempting to build the tallest ice sculpture in the world watched his roughly 60-foot creation come crashing down on Tuesday morning in Wisconsin. A video of the Lake Superior Ice Project collapsing at 10:06 a.m. this morning was posted to the Minnesota artist Iceman Roger Hanson's Facebook Page. Hanson was giving an interview about his project to the New York Times when the structure fell due to what Hanson believes is due to weeks of unseasonably warm weather. Scroll down for video . Standing tall: This roughly 60-foot ice sculpture collapsed at 10:06 a.m. this morning . Toppling down: One of the icy pillars in the sculpture’s 17 foot base caved in and the rest of the structure came tumbling down with it . Bye, bye, sculpture: It hasn't been confirmed but the Superior Ice Sculpture was nearly 60-feet tall which would break the record for the world's tallest ice sculpture currently held by China . Since December, Hanson spent hours every day spraying lake water onto a cable strung between two poles. The water would freeze and create shapes that continued to grow higher and higher. The Star Tribune reports that one of the icy pillars in the sculpture’s 17 foot base caved in and the rest of the structure came tumbling down with it. It hasn't been confirmed but the Superior Ice Sculpture was nearly 60-feet tall which would break the record for the world's tallest ice sculpture currently held by China. Yichun, China holds the record for tallest ice sculpture at 53 feet. Superior officials gave Hanson $30,000 to try to break the record and he was aiming for building it up to 70 feet. 'The weather just wasn't with us this year,' said Superior Parks Director Mary Morgan to the Star Tribune. Long process: Roger Hanson had been slept in a lakeside trailer by night and spent day after day spraying lake water onto a cable strung between two poles . Winter wonderland: The ice sculpture was meant to be a centerpiece for community gatherings starting on Valentine’s Day and wasn't expected to collapse until mid March . On January 24 the weather was as high as 44 degrees. Morgan told reporters that city officials will discuss whether or not they will be able to save the project. The ice sculpture was meant to be a centerpiece for community gatherings starting on Valentine’s Day. The collapse wasn't expected sometime until mid-March. '[I]ts collapse, expected sometime in mid-March, may also prove to be an exciting part of the process, the Superior-Douglas County Chamber of Commerce wrote on its site.

"Aberdeen has been named the 'most dismal town' in Scotland after winning an annual award that recognises the worst-looking place in the country. It beat out contenders including East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire and Greenock, Inverclyde, to take the Carbuncle Award, which is handed to a town that has continually let down its residents and has fallen behind in developing for the better. Urban Realm magazine, which administers the accolade, said Aberdeen had become the 'poor relation' of Scotland's cities, while residents and visitors slammed it as a 'grey, shambolic mess'. Idyllic: This postcard of the promenade along the Aberdeen waterfront shows crowds of people and a dance hall, left, where socials were held . Bleak: This photograph of the promenade today shows much of the shore has been paved. Experts say it has fallen behind in developing . Civilised: Union Street, pictured, was built to relieve the strain of the small cramped streets that people coming into the city had to navigate . Grey: The road, a major shopping thoroughfare, is just one example of the dreary architecture that helped earn the city the Carbuncle Award . The magazine cited planning issues surrounding Union Terrace Gardens, Marischal Square, and missing out on the 2017 City of Culture shortlist as evidence for Aberdeen deserving the award. But Aberdeen Council chiefs hit back at the award, branding it an 'attack' on the oil-rich city's long-standing reputation. The Carbuncle Awards are architectural prizes that have been handed out by Urban Realm magazine intermittently since 2000. The award categories include the Pock Mark award, for worst planning decision, the Zit Building, for Scotland's worst building, and the 'Plook on the Plinth Award' for the 'most dismal town' - 'plook' is a Scottish word for pimple. Public nominations are made via the magazine's website, with a small group of critics selecting the final winners. Speaking on Aberdeen's win, Urban Realm editor John Glenday commented: 'Aberdeen is a great city but despite its enviable financial clout and rich heritage legacy it has become the poor relation of the Scottish cities. Historic: Marischal College, which stands in the city centre, was founded in 1593. It now acts as Aberdeen City Council headquarters . Lost: The granite building now battles for space with newer buildings that reflect an 'anything goes' attitude, according to Urban Realm . Bustling: Aberdeen’s historic Green, pictured, and surroundings are among the oldest known parts of the city. Above, a market in 'the Green' Dreary: The area is now taking up with shops, and lined with the granite buildings that give Aberdeen its name - the Granite City . 'It has been left behind by the likes of Dundee, which has made huge strides to transform its waterfront. The time to turn things around is now, in a few years' time it may well be too late.' Residents and visitors took to the internet to slam the city's architecture. On social networking site Reddit, one user said: 'The infrastructure of this city is shambolic and simply can't support the ever-growing population, and I'm convinced that the scale of the problem is now so daunting that no council wants to touch it. The Carbuncle Awards are architectural prizes that have been handed out by Urban Realm magazine intermittently since 2000. They were established following a discussion about why policy initiatives to improve the quality of the built environment seemed to be having so little impact beyond the centres of Scotland's key cities. The name of the awards comes from a comment by Prince Charles, an outspoken critic of modern architecture, who in 1984 described Richard Rogers' proposed extension of London's National Gallery as a 'monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend'. The award categories include the Pock Mark award, for worst planning decision, the Zit Building, for Scotland's worst building, and the 'Plook on the Plinth Award' for the 'most dismal town'. 'Plook' is a Scottish word for pimple. Public nominations are made via the magazine's website, with a small group of critics selecting the final winners. 'They'd rather sit on their hands, waffling on about what a great and ambitious city Aberdeen is, and hoping the next guy will deal with it instead.' Another online user wrote: 'I remember going to Aberdeen for the first time when I was a kid, and just thinking this place is so grey. 'The buildings are grey, the road is grey, the sky was grey, everything just made me bored as a kid and I left thinking Aberdeen was dull. 'I know Aberdeen is the Granite City, but it needs some colour injected into it.' Another added: 'When I worked in Aberdeen I used to hang around the traffic lights just so I knew I hadn't gone colour blind.' But the novelty award was slammed by Aberdeen City Council bosses who branded it an 'attack' on the city's long-standing reputation. Convener of Aberdeen City Council's planning committee, Ramsay Milne, said he was disappointed by the decision. Cllr Milne said: 'I think it's absolute nonsense how some obscure periodical has come to this decision to no discussion with the city council. 'People should stop talking down this great city and talk it up. This is disheartening, but people will have common sense with their own experience of it being a good place to live.' Steve Harris, chief executive of VisitAberdeen, said he was pleased with the award as it has put the city into the spotlight. He said: 'Anything that draws attention to Aberdeen can only help people realise how preposterous and ignorant its award is. 'Aberdeen is a stunning city with beautiful parks and gardens, a beach that runs for miles right into the city centre, and some stunning architecture.' SNP MSP Kevin Stewart labelled the decision an 'unwarranted' attack. He said: 'The public criticism of the state of the city centre must be a wake-up call to the Labour-led administration that their inept management of the city cannot continue. 'This Carbuncle award is very unfair, but it if achieves anything, it must be to see the ludicrous Marischal Square scheme brought to a halt before the administration inflicts another disaster upon Aberdeen.' Some residents called out the council for refusing to accept the decision. Commenting online, Stephen Kain wrote: 'For me the denial from the council towards all this is the single most alarming fact. Everyone with eyes can see the mess our city centre has now become, and now seems nothing will ever be the wake-up call needed for this lot.

Character: Residents stroll along Union Street in this historic postcard. Tourism bosses called the Carbuncle Award 'preposterous' Grim: Urban Realm magazine, which administers the accolade, said Aberdeen had become the 'poor relation' of Scotland's cities . 'Only course of action left for the city will be to vote them out at next council elections.' Debbie Kerr wrote: 'Instead of criticising this 'award' - take a step back please all councillors and see Aberdeen for what it really is - what you have been doing to the Oil Capital of Europe (or not been doing) for years. 'For once - pay attention to the people of Aberdeen - and stop lining your own pockets!' The 'Pock Mark' award for worst planning decision was handed to Edinburgh City Council for demolition of the B-listed Scottish Provident Building on St Andrews Square. Edinburgh Airport's recently completed eastern terminal expansion meanwhile netted a 'Zit' accolade for Scotland's worst building. 1179: There has been a human presence in the area of Aberdeen since the Stone Age. It was first named a burgh in 1179. Initially, it was separated into Old Aberdeen - the university and cathedral settlement - and New Aberdeen, where the fishing and trading took place. 1336: The city was burned by Edward III of England in 1336, but was soon rebuilt and extended, and called New Aberdeen. For many centuries the city was subject to attacks by the neighbouring lords, and was strongly fortified, but the gates were all removed by 1770. 1495: King's College was founded by Bishop Elphinstone and is Scotland's third oldest university. The college merged with Marischal College in 1860 to create Aberdeen University as it is known today. 1740: Rubislaw Quarry, located at the Hill of Rubislaw in the west end of Aberdeen, was opened. It was sold some 30 years later as it was thought that the granite it produced did not work as a building material. However, over the next 200 years an estimated six million tonnes were excavated from the quarry - giving Aberdeen the nickname, The Granite City. 1742: In the 18th century a new Town Hall was built. This century also saw the beginnings of social services for the Infirmary at Woolmanhill which was opened in 1742 and the Lunatic Asylum in 1779. 1805: Aberdeen changed rapidly from the late 1790s to the early 1800s when the council agreed that a programme of building new streets should be put into place. By 1805 George Street, King Street and Union Street were open. 1817: The construction of the new streets was expensive work, and the city faced bankruptcy in 1817. The growth of the shipbuilding and fishing industries in the 19th century brought a need for improved harbour facilities. During this century much of the harbour as it exists today was built including Victoria Dock, the South Breakwater and the extension to the North Pier. 1883: The first turf was laid at Duthie Park, a gift to the city to benefit the citizens of Aberdeen, this year. It was officially opened by Princess Beatrice two years later. 1943: The night of 21st April, 1943, saw the heaviest bombing to hit Aberdeen during the War. A Luftwaffe raid dropped 129 bombs on Aberdeen resulting in 125 deaths and considerable damage to the city. This event is referred to as the Aberdeen Blitz.","Annual Carbuncle Awards are handed to least attractive places in Scotland by architecture magazine Urban Realm .

"A former Power Ranger allegedly murdered his roommate with a replica medieval sword in a row over his girlfriend. Ricardo Medina Jr, who played the Red Ranger, reportedly told officers that he stabbed Joshua Sutter after he forced his way into his bedroom during the fight. Sutter was said to have been angry that Medina's girlfriend was spending too much time at their home when the former Power Ranger was not there, TMZ reported. The 37-year-old has been charged with killing his roommate by stabbing him in the abdomen with the sharp weapon on Saturday afternoon. Medina, who reportedly called 911 himself, was taken into custody in Palmdale, California, shortly after, reports claim. Sutter was taken to hospital and pronounced dead. Murder accusation: TMZ reported that Ricardo Medina Jr stabbed his roommate in the abdomen and was arrested. He is pictured left at a fan convention and right in Power Rangers costume . The roommates started fighting at around 3.30pm, according to reports. Medina went into his room with his girlfriend but Sutter tried to follow them, the report states. It was then that Medina allegedly dealt the fatal blow. He has been charged and detained, with his bail set at $1 million. Medina starred in the 2002 TV series Power Rangers Wild Force before playing Deker in the 2011 series Power Rangers Samurai. He also voiced Deker in the video game Power Rangers Samurai, and in the movie Power Rangers Samurai: A New Enemy, which hit theaters in 2012. Born and raised in Los Angeles, California, Medina was also pursuing a singing career and had stints in ER and CSI, according to his IMDb profile. 'Attack': The actor allegedly speared his roommate during an argument then called 911 himself . 'He is a great friend and a great client. It's something I can't even conceive. I don't see that in him. He was a very helpful guy and great with his dog. It's such a shock,' said Gar Lester, Medina's former agent who has known the actor for 12 years, told ABC7. Medina's neighbor, Justin Adamson, said the actor had moved into the block about two months ago. He told ABC7: 'We brought him some bread and just tried to interact a little bit with him, but he was more of the, you know, the type of guy that didn't really want to communicate.'","Ricardo Medina Jr, 37, allegedly stabbed roommate to death in California .

"A Florida mother-of-three  will not be charged  after forcing her  son to dress up in girls' clothes and put makeup on as punishment for wetting the bed while she took photographs. One picture, which shows the 10-year-old boy with tears streaming down his face, was posted and shared on Facebook before a relative brought it to the attention of law enforcement officials. Prosecutors said Monday that there was not enough evidence to charge Christle Prado and her roommate Keith Driscoll, who were both arrested in December for inflicting physical or mental injury during an act of child cruelty. A Florida mother-of-three and her roommate will not be charged after they forced her 10-year-old son to dress up in girls' clothes and put makeup on as punishment for wetting the bed . Christle Prado (left) and Keith Driscoll (right) were arrested in December for child cruelty. Prado said Driscoll came up with the idea and admitted she sent photographs to her boyfriend in a private Facebook message . A neighbor said Driscoll forced the boy, who was crying as others pointed and laughed at him, to run outside the house while wearing the dress and makeup, according to Click Orlando. Prado told police Driscoll came up with the punishment, and that the boy was only dressed in the clothing for a couple of minutes. She said she didn't stop it from happening because she did not want to ruin her living situation with Driscoll, who is also her landlord, but admitted to sending photographs to her boyfriend in a private Facebook message. Angela Starke, a public information officer from the Orange/Osceola County State Attorney's Office, said a child cruelty charge requires evidence that the crime caused discernible and substantial impairment to the child's 'intellectual or psychological capacity' and their ability to function 'within the normal range'. The boy, who has a documented medical condition, and his two siblings are now in the custody of their grandmother Sherry Morden, who said the abuse has gone on for far too long. She told Click Orlando: 'Tears were just pouring from his eyes, and I guess she seemed to think it was OK. 'I told him that it wasn't his fault and he didn't deserve it. He shouldn't be punished for something that is not his fault.' The boy (right) and his two siblings are now in the custody of their grandmother Sherry Morden (left).

The Florida Department of Children and Families confirmed Prado has been investigated for previous incidents but said they could not elaborate. Department representative Kristi Gray said the case against Prado was now closed. 'I can't disclose the findings of our case as they are not public record,' she said. 'But the children remain in protective custody with relatives.' According to Gray, any prior history with the Department of Children and Families does not become public unless there is a death attributed to child abuse or neglect.

"Whenever a pack of bullies comes around it helps to have a big guy on your side - and when that helping hand is a hippo you know your luck is in. In this amazing video a baby hippo sends a pack of wild dogs scampering away from a fortunate kudu at the Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe. The female of the antelope species was a target for the bloodthirsty mob, and had leaped into a water hole to escape their clutches. Scroll down for video . The baby hippo showed sent the mob of wild dogs packing at the Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe . Earlier it seemed the hippos were going to chase the kudu ashore where certain death by the dogs awaited . The kudu makes a desperate attempt to evade a pursuing hippo while the dogs lie in wait on the banks . She thought she was safe as the dogs can't swim, but then found herself sharing the water with three crocodiles and three hippos. Luckily for the kudu the reptiles weren't hungry, having stolen a kill from the wild dogs two days before, while she found an unlikely ally in the baby of the three hippos who jumped out of the water and chased the dogs away. Sue-Ellen Kuhn, a guest at the park, said: 'It was the crack of dawn and we headed to the closest watering hole on safari expecting to see zebras, antelopes, giraffes, elephants leisurely drinking in silent thankfulness that they had survived the night. 'To our delight, we stumbled across an exciting dance of life and death. 'On the banks of the watering hole was a pack of 11 wild dogs in full hunting mode. These dogs are frenzied and vicious killers that feed on their prey before it has died. 'As wild dogs can't swim, the kudu thought that she was safe in the water but she was sadly mistaken as that watering hole was also home to three hippos and three crocodiles. 'We waited by the watering hole for three hours, all the while transfixed by the scene playing out in front of us. 'The dogs were snapping on the bank, the hippos were pushing the kudu to the edge and the crocs were lurking. 'We hoped the kudu would survive but couldn't see how with the odds so heavily stacked against her. The hippo took on the entire pack, none of whom were brave enough to try and strike their larger opponent . The dogs mass on the banks for the water hole just waiting for the kudu to come ashore so they can attack . Two of the dogs got close to their female target but she managed to stay just out of range in the water . The dogs made an attempt to attack a crocodile but had no more joy than they did with the hippo or kudu . The kudu nervously eyes the waiting dogs as she just manages to keep her head above water . 'We braced ourselves for the inevitable and distressing scene we knew was coming. 'To us, the only mystery was whether the kudu would succumb to the wild dogs, the hippos or the crocs.' Instead the kudu slipped away to safety while the baby hippo was filmed bellowing at the pack of dogs, sending them scattering as it showed its mighty jaws. One or two of the bolder members keep coming close and harassing their much larger opponent but the hippo ultimately sees them all off. Fellow guest Cees van Ginkel added: 'To our surprise the crocs swam right past the kudu and got out of the water to sun themselves on the bank. 'Apparently they had stolen a kill from the wild dogs two days before in exactly the same circumstances and weren't hungry. 'The dogs turned their attention to one of the crocs, without success. The law of the jungle played out - there is always another predator bigger than you. 'To add insult to injury, the baby hippo got out of the water and chased the dogs away. With help from it's new friend and safe from immediate danger, we left the kudu warming itself in the morning sun.' Rose Hipwood, founder of The Luxury Safari Company said: 'To see something which involves all of these species is incredible but to see it in Zimbabwe is even more special.' The kudu had to avoid the pack of dogs and the hippos, who appeared to be circling her with similar intent . The hippos chased the kudu around the watering hole for a time but one of them ended up being an ally .","Amazing video shows hippo scaring dogs away in Zimbabwe national park .

"One of Benedict Cumberbatch's former teachers has revealed how the star's Harrow education has hindered his career. Martin Tyrell, Cumberatch's drama teacher at the public school in north west London, said the actor's expensive education may have limited the range of potential parts he could play. The Imitation Game actor, 38, has been shortlisted for an Academy Award for his role as mathematician and Second World War codebreaker Alan Turing in the movie. One of Benedict Cumberbatch's former teachers has revealed how the star's Harrow education has hindered his career . Martin Tyrell, Cumberatch's drama teacher at Harrow (pictured) in north west London, said the actor's private education may have limited the number of parts he could play . Talking about the star's time at the £34,590-a-year school, Mr Tyrell told the Radio Times magazine: 'Going to a major independent school is of no importance or value or help at all. 'I don't think anyone ever bought an education at Harrow in order for their son to become an actor.' He added: 'I feel that they are being limited (from playing certain parts) by critics and audiences as a result of what their parents did for them at the age of 13. And that seems to me very unfair.' Eddie Redmayne, Dominic West, Damian Lewis and Tom Hiddleston are among the privately educated British actors who are enjoying big success in Hollywood. The Imitation Game actor, 38, has been shortlisted for an Academy Award for his role as mathematician and Second World War codebreaker Alan Turing in the movie . Veteran actress Julie Walters, The Walking Dead star David Morrissey and Call The Midwife star Stephen McGann have complained about the dearth of young actors emerging from poorer backgrounds. Mr Tyrell said he spotted Cumberbatch's talent when he auditioned for the role of 'Saucy French Maid' as a teenager. He added: 'Even as a 13-year-old, he was obviously an outstanding actor - a combination of intuition and intellect. 'It's probably once in a lifetime that you find a boy actor as magnificent as this. 'I remember him auditioning very early on for the part of a saucy French maid in a farce. It was a small part, involving a feather duster for about 10 minutes, but even then in rehearsal he was strikingly mature. 'He took direction, immediately understood the comic requirements of the part and was very, very funny.

"A heroic Lebanese man handed his three-year-old son to his wife and jumped on top of a suicide bomber just seconds before the terrorist blew himself up, it has been claimed. Qasim Hatoum is understood to have spotted a Saudi man preparing to detonate the explosives shortly after boarding a bus in a rare attack in the centre of the Syrian capital Damascus. In a selfless act Hatoum sought to cushion the impact of the coming blast, handing his son to his wife before running towards the militant and leaping on top of him. The terrorist - later confirmed as a member of Al Qaeda's Syrian-affiliate Al Nusra Front - was still able to blow himself up, killing at least six people, including Hatoum, and wounding 19 others. However it is possible that the death toll could have even higher had Hatoum not heroically attempted to less the impact. It may even have killed his wife and child, the latter of whom is still receiving treatment for shrapnel wounds to the face at Damascus' Great Prophet Hospital. Scroll down for video . Blast: The bus, Lebanese number plates, had been carrying pilgrims close to Damascus' Sayyida Ruqayya shrine, according to television channel al-Manar, which is run by Lebanese Shi'ite movement Hezbollah . Carnage: Following the attack a social media account linked to Al Qaeda's Nusra Front said the hardline Sunni group was behind the blast, which took place near Hamidiyeh market place . Reports of Hatoum's bravery emerged two days after the terror attack on local news website Al Akhbar, where he was described as a 'martyr' who gave his life to save the lives of others. The website claimed the suicide bomber had boarded the bus pretending to be a travelling salesman before standing at the front and preparing to blow himself up. The bus, Lebanese number plates, had been carrying pilgrims close to Damascus' Sayyida Ruqayya shrine, according to television channel al-Manar, which is run by Lebanese Shi'ite movement Hezbollah. Hatoum's funeral was held in the Burj Barajneh neighbourhood of Beirut yesterday, where mourners flocked to the streets and fired guns into the air to pay their respects before his burial at the nearby Alradov cemetery. Following the attack a social media account linked to Al Qaeda's Nusra Front said the hardline Sunni group was behind the blast, which took place near Hamidiyeh market place. Impact: Rescue workers sifted through the rubble and cleared away pools of blood from the ground . Torn apart: The Nusra Front Twitter feed said one of the group's members blew himself up inside a bus at the market. It posted a photo of a man it said was the bomber and another of the wrecked vehicle . Rescue workers sifted through the rubble and cleared away pools of blood from the ground. Syria's state news agency SANA said the 'terrorist bombing' involved five kilograms of explosives placed in the front of the bus and that authorities had defused a second device inside a bag which was found on the floor of the vehicle. On Sunday Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi told parliament that Syria aimed to 'flush out all terrorists' in 2015. 'Hezbollah condemns the bombing that infidel criminals carried out in Damascus,' a headline on the channel said, citing a statement from the group. It described the bombing as one in a series targeting visitors to Syria and civilians and said it should stiffen resolve to defeat such attackers. Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters over the border to support Syrian government forces battling an insurgency which has drawn in countries across the Middle East and stoked sectarian tensions. Syria's Ikhbariya television showed footage of men and a woman in hospital with wounds. It also showed video of the blackened, wrecked bus and security services picking through the damage. Clean-up: A Syrian soldier gathers evidence after the suicide bomb blast in central Damascus on Saturday . Trick: The suicide bomber is believed to have boarded the bus pretending to be a travelling salesman before standing at the front and preparing to blow himself up . The Nusra Front Twitter feed said one of the group's members blew himself up inside a bus at the market. It posted a photo of a man it said was the bomber and another of the wrecked vehicle. Nusra Front has been battling the Syrian military as well as other insurgent groups in Syria. While fighting has raged on the outskirts of Damascus, attacks in the centre are not common. In a speech to parliament broadcast on state television, Prime Minister Halqi said Syria would 'back any initiatives to fight global terrorism'. Hours before the attack, he said Syria would not allow its enemies 'to destroy the land of religions and cradle of civilisations'. Syria has repeatedly said it wants to coordinate with other countries to fight armed groups in its country. It describes all anti-government forces in Syria as terrorists, unlike Western countries and their Arab allies who distinguish between the hardline jihadists and more mainstream rebel fighters. Syria's uprising started in 2011 with anti-government protests and has descended into a civil war pitting a range of armed groups against the military. Jihadist groups such as Islamic State and al Qaeda's Nusra Front have gained ground.","Qasim Hatoum spotted suicide bomber standing at the front of a bus .

"Malcolm Butler is finally getting his hands on that Super Bowl MVP prize. The New England Patriots cornerback, who just last May was an undrafted rookie, became a part of history on Sunday after he made one of the biggest plays in Bowl history, turning a possible Patriots loss into a definite Patriots victory when he intercepted Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson on the one-yard-line with just 20 seconds left in the game. The play was so big in fact, and so crucial to the Patriots victory, that many felt Butler would be taking home MVP honors for the evening. In the end tough, it went to the man who two interceptions that night, and two previous MVP trophies - Tom Brady. Scroll down for video . Tom Brady (above) will be splitting his Super Bowl MVP prize with Malcom Butler . Butler (right with Julian Edelman and Micky Mouse) made an interception that secured a Patriots victory in the Super Bowl . And while Brady was sure to mention Butler and his game-changing play when accepting his award, he reportedly decided to make things a bit more official on Tuesday by  getting his off-season started with a pretty impressive and unconventional play of his own and handing off the truck that is awarded to the winner each year, in this case a nice new Chevrolet Colorado, which retails for about $20,000, to Butler. The Detroit News reports Brady will keep the actual trophy. And while many outside the organization are surprised by Butler's rise from virtually unknown to post-season legend, his teammates have been seeing this kind of work and smart play in practice all season. 'He’s been doing it to me in practice all season so it was nice to see him pick someone else off,' joked Brady. This after Brady said as he received his MVP award; 'Malcolm made a huge play to save our season. It was the perfect play at the perfect time. None of us will ever forget that play.' Brady has decided to keep the trophy but regift the free Chevrolet Colorado pickup he got - worth about $18,000 . Vince Wilfork, the most respected member of the team's defense, echoed Brady's statement, saying; 'That is just one of those things that is so fitting for him just because of how he worked himself into playing time.' Butler's play was not just a win for the Patriots either, with his uplifting story and remarkable play providing the NFL with one of the few positive stories to come out of the league during this scandal-plagued season and ending things on a very high not. Brady added a few more records to his legacy on Sunday well as he now has the most Super Bowl appearances (six), the most Super Bowl victories alongside Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana (four), and the most MVP trophies, again shared with Montana (three).","Tom Brady has given the Chevrolet Colorado he received for winning the Super Bowl MVP trophy to cornerback Malcolm Butler .

"A former policeman who regularly beat his wife because it was 'part of the culture' in their home country of Romania has been jailed after moving to Britain. Narcis Ioo, 44, who speaks little English, admitted threatening to kill his wife and assaulting her before he was jailed at Gloucester Crown Court. However, he has now been granted immediate release from prison after his battered wife Veronica said she did not want to see him locked up. Romanian-born Narcis Ioo, 44, who moved to the UK a couple of months ago, admitted threatening to kill his wife Veronica (pictured right outside Gloucester Crown Court) and assaulting her while drunk on July 17 . Ioo, who is suffering from cancer, was arrested on July 17 after flying into a fit of rage after downing half a bottle of whisky at the couple's home in Dursley, Gloucestershire. In anger, he threw a laptop across a room before grabbing a knife from a kitchen drawer and threatening to stab the pair's 20-year-old son Paul, the court heard. Their son rang his mother for help and she overheard on the phone that Ioo was making threats to kill her. When she got home, Ioo kicked both her and Paul and police were called to the scene. Ioo was taken into custody – where he has been for the last 27 days – and held until yesterday's court hearing. However, after admitting the offences, Judge Jamie Tabor QC passed a 54-day sentence, which enables Ioo to be released on parole either today or tomorrow. The judge also made a seven year restraining order banning Ioo from seeing or contacting his wife except for a maximum of once a week by phone. Mrs Ioo, who has been in the UK working to pay off debts incurred by her husband's medical treatment in Romania for the last two years, made a plea to the judge for him to be released because she said she still loves him. She told the court that her husband had a good well-paid position in the Romanian police for 19 years and when he was struck with cancer, she moved to the UK with their son to get work which would pay for his medical treatment. He joined the pair a couple of months later. Ioo was arrested in July and held in custody until he was jailed for 56 weeks at Gloucester Crown Court (above). He will now be immediately released from prison after his wife pleaded for him to not be locked up . She said it was the culture in Romania for men to beat their wives and said it happened to her – but she did not hold that against him. 'He has hit me before, but never told me he was going to kill me. He was very, very drunk,' she said. 'I will never have a problem with the justice system here, but it is hard for me to see my husband in jail. 'But the real punishment for my husband is that he is without his family.' However, she also said was fearful of remaining with him and said she was prepared to pay for him to go back to Romania. But the court was told that he does not want to leave the UK and has been offered a home and work by fellow countrymen in Bristol. 'I will never have a problem with the justice system here, but it is hard for me to see my husband in jail' - Veronica Ioo . Sabhia Pathan, defending, said Ioo had resigned his post in the Romanian police force as a result of his wife and son settling in the UK and came here to join them and re-establish the family. Until then he had been the main breadwinner but he had not found work in this country. He still had a mortgaged house in Romania but was in arrears and if he went back he would not be able to find work or afford a home, she said. Passing sentence on Ioo, Judge Tabor said 'Your wife plainly still retains a great deal of affection for you. 'She has told this court that when in Romania you beat her regularly. Interestingly, she made no complaint about that for she says that it is part of Romanian culture. It is not part of British culture. 'When men beat women they are regarded as cowardly criminals. 'What she drew the line at however was when you threatened to kill her. That is what has brought you to this court today. 'You are a man without convictions who has been very unwell and you were in a foreign country. I take all that into account. 'The fact is that however fond of you though she be she has had enough of you. My principal task today is to protect her from any further violence. 'Do not hit any more women or young people and in no circumstances ever pick up a knife again.'","Narcis Ioo kicked his wife and threatened to kill her at Gloucestershire home .

"The gap in bachelor-degree attainment between the nation's richest and poorest students by age 24 has doubled during the last four decades, according to a report released on Tuesday. The percentage of students from the lowest-income families — those making $34,160 a year or less — earning a bachelor's degree has inched up just 3 points since 1970, rising from 6 to 9 percent by 2013. Meanwhile, college completion for students from the wealthiest families has risen dramatically, climbing from 44 to 77 percent. 'It's really quite amazing how big the differences have become between those from the highest and lowest family incomes,' said Laura Perna, a University of Pennsylvania professor and executive director of the Alliance for Higher Education and Democracy, one of the two organizations that published the study examining college costs and degree attainment. Wealth divide: College completion for students from the wealthiest families, many of whom who attend Ivy League Universities like UPenn (pictured), has risen dramatically, climbing from 44 to 77 percent . The study comes amid renewed debate on college affordability spurred by President Barack Obama's proposal to make two years of college free. If adopted in every state, the proposal would benefit a projected 9 million students each year. It would cost taxpayers an estimated $60 billion over 10 years — a price the Republican-controlled Congress is likely to be hesitant to embrace. Among the report's other findings: The percentage of students from all income levels enrolling in college has increased, shrinking the gap in enrollment between rich and poor 'somewhat' during the last four decades. There was a 46-point gap between the two groups in 1970, compared with a 36-point gap in 2012. But completion gaps are growing: While 99 percent of students entering college from the highest-income families — those making $108,650 or more a year — graduate by 24, just 21 percent of students from the lowest-income families finish by that age. Perna said there are a number of factors contributing to the widening divide, including access to the information and support needed to enter college and graduate; college readiness; and the availability of higher education that meets people's needs, particularly for students who might have children, limited access to transportation and full-time jobs. She also noted that the likelihood of finishing a degree varies dramatically by the type of institution. Students from the poorest families are overrepresented in public two-year institutions, which tend to have lower completion rates, while those from wealthier families are abundant in doctoral-granting institutions. The Obama administration has expanded the availability of Pell grants and supported a tax credit for tuition costs, but the study says the amount of the maximum Pell grant award has not kept up with the rising cost of college. College costs were more than two times higher in 2012 than in 1975 at the start of the Pell grant program, which provides aid to low-income students based on need. Pell grants covered 67 percent of college costs in 1975 but only 27 percent in 2012. Proposal: The results of the study come at a time when President Obama is Proposing to make two years of college free in order to allow less wealthy students to graduate . 'We sometimes think that low-income students are taken care of because of the federal program. But you can see it covers so much less than (when) it was first established,' said Margaret Cahalan, director of the Pell Institute for the Study of Opportunity in Higher Education, the second institution involved in the report. The study shows the burden of paying for college has increasingly shifted from state and local governments to students and families. That, Perna said, should prompt an important question: Who should pay for college given the individual and societal benefits? 'Students only have so many resources they can use to pay the costs,' Perna said. Michael Kramer, 29, is the first in his family to attend college. The son of a country club maintenance supervisor and a factory worker, he went straight to jobs in retail and plumbing after graduating high school, unable to afford college. He eventually enrolled in a community college while working full time and is now taking out loans to help finish his bachelor's degree at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""We're a country that says everybody should be getting higher education, and nowadays, to get any decent job, you need a bachelor's degree,"" Kramer said. But for low-income students like him, Kramer said the high cost of college often means making a difficult choice between fulfilling basic food and housing needs and obtaining a postsecondary education. 'It's a continuous cycle that they get stuck in,' he said.","College completion for students from the wealthiest families has risen dramatically, climbing from 44 to 77 percent .

"Diane Sawyer is in the final stages of securing an exclusive interview with Bruce Jenner during which the Olympic gold medalist turned reality star will discuss his intentions to transition to live as a woman, according to reports. Rumors about Jenner's desire to come out as transgender have intensified in recent months after he started making dramatic changes to his appearance including having his Adam's apple shaved, growing his hair long and wearing nail polish. The speculation intensified over the weekend when People magazine quoting a 'Jenner insider' as confirming that the rumors are true. Scroll down for video . Diane Sawyer is in the final stages of securing an exclusive interview with Bruce Jenner during which the Olympic gold medalist turned reality star will discuss his intentions to transition to live as a woman . 'Bruce is transitioning to a woman,' the family insider confirmed. 'He is finally happy and his family is accepting of what he's doing. He's in such a great space. That's why it's the perfect time to do something like this.' Jenner hasn't officially confirmed the speculation, but BuzzFeed reports that Sawyer and ABC News are close to securing the first interview during which he will discuss his life-changing decision. Bruce made the formal announcement to his large family last month which was filmed for a docu-series recording his journey from man to woman to be broadcast later this year. The reality show will air on E!, the NBC Universal cable channel that has broadcast Kardashian-based reality shows since 2007. The exclusive with 65-year-old Jenner would be a huge coup for ABC since E!'s corporate sibling NBC News would have seemed the more obvious choice. The former Olympic gold medalist has been pictured in recent months with manicured nails, smooth legs, longer locks and what appeared to be fuller lips . Not landing the Jenner interview has caused much strife in the news division, reports Buzzfeed. The former Olympic gold medalist has been pictured in recent months with manicured nails, smooth legs, longer locks and what appeared to be fuller lips. People's source revealed that the Kardashian-Jenner family has been allowed time to get used to the idea, and that they're slowly accepting his decision. 'He's being very smart about and also respectful about his transition,' the insider said. 'Instead of completely shocking everyone, his changes have been subtle, and his family has had the chance to slowly get used to his new looks and life.' 'He has come out to those closest to him... He's been through a dark period and is coming out on the other side,' added the insider. The transgender rumours began in 2013 shortly after he separated from his third wife Kris Jenner and moved into a Malibu beach bachelor pad . The transgender rumors began in 2013 shortly after he separated from his third wife Kris Jenner and moved into a Malibu beach bachelor pad. Stepdaughter Kim hinted at Bruce's transition last month when she told Entertainment Tonight: 'I think everyone goes through things in life, and I think that story and what Bruce is going through, I think he'll share whenever the time is right.' Bruce has six children from his three marriages - daughters Kendall, 19, and Kylie, 17, with Kris Jenner; sons Brandon, 33 and Brody, 31, with ex-wife Linda Thompson; and daughter Cassandra, 34, and son Burt, 36, with ex-wife Chrystie Crownover.

"A Colorado plane crash last near Denver May was likely caused by the pilot and passenger taking selfies on board. The National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) report published yesterday on the crash that killed two people says that a GoPro camera was found among the wreckage. The plane was fully operational. Video footage from the camera showed the pilot Amritpal Singh and a passenger, who hasn't been publicly identified, taking selfies at dangerously low altitudes. Scroll down for video . Crash: A Cessna 150 crashed last May killing the pilot Amritpal Singh and his passenger on board . Took selfies: Video footage from the camera found in the wreckage showed the pilot Amritpal Singh (pictured left and right) and one passenger taking selfies at low altitudes . CBS reports that a Cessna 150 crashed in a field two miles from Front Range Airport while the plane was doing night-time takes offs and landings. His flight took off at around 12:30 a.m. on May 31 and family members reported him missing a few hours later at 3:45 a.m. The wreckage was discovered at 7 a.m. that morning. Neither Singh nor the passenger survived the crash. The NTSB said the 29-year-old pilot who also owned the plane did not meet the requirements for night flights with passengers. 'Pilot and passengers were taking self-photographs with their cell phones’ the NTSB report states. The report also said that the passengers were using the camera's flash function at night which may have distracted the pilot. One of the pilot's professors at Metro State University, Jeff Price, said that Singh loved to fly but that he shouldn't have been taking photographs. Price speculated the flash function on the camera may have startled him while flying. Price said he once got distracted while flying his own plane when someone took a flash picture and he thought it was lightning. 'A post-accident examination of the airplane did not reveal any pre-impact anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Based on the wreckage distribution, which was consistent with a high-speed impact, and the degraded visual reference conditions, it is likely that the pilot experienced spatial disorientation and lost control of the airplane,' said the report. GoPro: The plane showed no signs of functional abnormalities and a GoPro (which may have resembled this one) found on board showed that the pilot and passenger were taking selfies while in flight .","The National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) report on the crash that killed two people says that a GoPro camera was found among the wreckage .

"There was a time when politicians would climb on to a soapbox to address voters, before they found comfort on the breakfast TV sofa. Now the battle for swing voters has moved to the Loose Women panel, with the three main parties sending high-flying female MPs onto the ITV show. It comes as polls show more than a third of women are yet to decide who to vote for on May 7. Lib Dem minister Jo Swinson, Tory minister Esther McVey and Labour frontbencher Gloria de Piero will all join the Loose Women panel in the run-up to the election . Every party has prioritised wooing female voters, with around half of women believing politicians do not understand what life is like for them. Now senior politicians are to go into the lion’s den of the Loose Women studios in the days before the election. Tory employment minister Esther McVey and Labour’s shadow women’s minister Gloria de Piero, both former TV presenters, will appear on the show. Lib Dem business minister Jo Swinson will complete the line-up of politicians targeting daytime viewers. Editor of Loose Women Martin Frizell said: “Loose Women is the first show to start the election campaign. Three of the youngest and most prolific female politicians will explain how they are making their mark and how they are working to feature in the future government.” They will appear with the regular line-up of straight-talking panel members including Ruth Langsford, Coleen Nolan, Jamelia and Janet Street Porter. Miss de Piero, who worked on GMTV before entering politics, told MailOnline: ‘Labour has some great policies for women and families and it will be great to be grilled about them by Ruth, Coleen, Jamelia and Janet. ‘The election won't be won by people who inhabit the bubble of Westminster so I'm looking forward to getting out of that bubble as much as possible and Loose Women will be a great place to do just that.’ The politicians will appear with the regular line-up of straight-talking panel members including Ruth Langsford, Coleen Nolan, Jamelia and Janet Street Porter . Miss McVey, who was once a GMTV presenter, will appear on Wednesday February 18 while Miss de Piero will join the panel on Tuesday March 3. Miss Swimson will be on the show on Tuesday March 17. A poll this week showed women voters have put the NHS, living costs and family care pressures as their top concerns for the general election. Some 59 per cent of women said they were concerned about the NHS, while 40 per cent of women identified living costs as a major issue and 30 per cent picked the cost of caring for their family - all of which were lower down on the list of priorities for male voters. The findings will provide a boost for Labour, which has put the health service and what it calls the cost of living crisis at the heart of its campaigning. According to the research by TNS for BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, 31 per cent of men were concerned about the economy, including the deficit and unemployment, compared to just 21 per cent of women. The polling found 48 per cent of women felt that none of the leaders - David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Ukip's Nigel Farage, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Green Party leader Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood - understands what life is like for them and their families, compared with 41 per cent of men. When it comes to the two major party leaders, just 10 per cent of women believe that the Prime Minister best understands their daily lives, while 12 per cent of women said the same about Mr Miliband. While that finding may not make particularly welcome reading for those currently at the helm of Britain's parties, the findings are likely to be better received by Theresa May. It found that 44 per cent of voters overall believed the Home Secretary would perform well as leader of the Conservative Party. Labour counterpart Yvette Cooper was backed by 38 per cent of voters.","Battle for the female vote persuades frontbenchers to join ITV panel show .

"As the dust settles from the New England Patriots Super Bowl win on, conspiracy theories have begun to circulate about just why Pete Carroll didn't use the obvious ace up his sleeve. The Seattle head coach has taken  responsibility for the call in the dying moments of the game when the Seahawks ran a passing play, with quarterback Russell Wilson trying to find receiver Ricardo Lockette. Patriots corner Malcolm Butler read that play perfectly, timed his move and made the interception to assure a fourth Super Bowl title for the Patriots. Scroll down for video . Conspiracy? Commentators are reporting a theory that Seahawks coach chose Russell Wilson, left, to be the star of his final play over Marshawn Lynch, right, because Lynch is not as media friendly . 'Derek Jeter with a Bible': Wilson is seen greeting fans and airline employees on the team's return from the Super Bowl at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport following their defeat . But now questions have been asked about why, with his team on the one-yard line and needing a touchdown to win, he didn't tell Wilson to hand the ball back to star running back Marshawn Lynch. The flames of conspiracy are thought to have been fanned by at least one voice from the Seahawks locker room, who refused to discount the theory that Carroll 'had a vested interest in making Wilson, rather than Lynch, the hero.' 'That's what it looked like,' the anonymous player told NFL.com's Mike Silver in the immediate aftermath of the match. In The Nation, sports correspondent Dave Zirin quoted a second anonymous Seahawk who told him: '[I] can't believe it. We all saw it. They wanted it to be Russ. They didn't want Marshawn to be the hero.' The suggestion is that Carroll chose Wilson over Lynch because of Lynch's open defiance of the media and of the league as well as, controversially, his unapologetic black masculinity. Twice before Lynch has been fined $50,000 by the NFL for refusing to speak to reporters and was fined another $20,000 for making an obscene gesture after scoring a touchdown in the Seahawks' NFC championship game win over Green Bay Packers. Last week, on Super Bowl media day, the 28-year-old player answered all 25 questions he was fielded with exactly the same answer: 'I'm just here so I won't get fined.' Then, after the debacle of the game itself, his reputation seemed confirmed as he barged past news cameras on his way out of the University of Phoenix stadium without even a  word of comment. As Jamil Smith put it in New Republic: 'Unsurprisingly, a lot of folks in the league and in the media haven’t been able to deal, slapping Lynch with what Mychal Denzel Smith called recently the “unapologetically black tax,” exacted upon black people in public life who are unwilling to kowtow to largely white critics.' Later, Smith writes: 'Lynch manifests a kind of public black masculinity that actively challenges and offends the stoic, team-first athlete the NFL still blindly idealizes.' Zirin echoes those suspicions in his analysis for The Nation, adding: 'Russell Wilson is your young clean-cut God-fearing media-perfect quarterback. If one was creating a superstar face to market for the twenty-first century, chances are they would look, sound and basically be Russell Wilson. 'He's Derek Jeter with a Bible, someone who comes across like he has never spoken out of turn in his entire life.' The conspiracy theory goes that Carroll thought that, with the final play was in the bag, it was much better to give that fairytale Super Bowl moment to Wilson rather than Lynch. As Zirin writes: 'The politics of race, respectability, public relations and what's in the best interest of a $2billion corporation all played into this. That's the theory.' Carroll himself has tried to explain the decision that many say cost the Seahawks the Super Bowl by saying they they didn't want to run against their goal line defense and were planning on waiting until the third or fourth down to make the game-winning play. He therefore decided to 'waste' the play. Dejected: Pete Carroll is facing a backlash after making what some have called the 'worst play call ever' in the dying moments of the Super Bowl . Determined: Russell Wilson responded to the criticism on Monday after taking some of the blame for the play . He said: 'Really what happened, it was frankly really clear, we went to three receivers and they sent in their goal line people. We had plenty of downs and a time out and didn't want to run against their goal line people right there. 'I told my guys that's my fault totally. We had plenty of time to win the game. We were playing for third or fourth down, but it didn't work out that way.' The decision to pass rather than give the ball to Lynch was instantly criticized by former players and analysts. 'That was the worst play call I've seen in the history of football,' tweeted Hall of Fame running back and three-time Super Bowl winner Emmitt Smith. Seahawks coach Carroll was not surprisingly the man given the blame. 'That play call will haunt Pete for the rest of his career,' tweeted former Cowboys receiver Terrell Owens. 'Give the ball to Beastmode (Lynch) in that situation.' Carroll said his thinking was that the Patriots had their run defense in place and with his wide receivers on the field, they were not well matched-up for a run play. Crucial moment: Seattle ran a passing play, with Russell Wilson trying to find receiver Ricardo Lockette. But Patriots corner Malcolm Butler intercepted and secured the title . He added: 'It is a really clear thought but it didn't work out right. We happened to throw them the ball and they make a big play. 'At this time it seems like overthinking but they have extra guys at the line up scrimmage so we don't want to waste a run play on that,' he said. 'We make those decisions every game, all the time. They work out sometimes and they don't other times. This one didn't work out right for us.' Wilson agreed. 'We had a good play. If it was a catch, it would be a completely different story. I thought it was going to be a touchdown when I threw it. I thought it was going to be game over,' he said. Carroll said he and Wilson had shared a moment of disbelief at the end of the game. 'We just looked at each other trying to realize the gravity of what we just witnessed. We didn't say very much'. Some of the Seahawk players however disagreed. Linebacker Bruce Irvin told NFL.com he did not understand the call as they have 'the best back in the league'.

"A dog rescued from the streets of Thailand overcame two life-threatening illnesses to be dubbed the 'happiest in the world' after her pictures won the hearts of more than 150,000 people. Gluta has become an internet sensation since her now-owner Sorasart Wisetsin began posting pictures of his much-loved pet on social media sites. But her happy disposition hides her traumatic past - which saw her rescued from the streets by Sorasart, before undergoing life-saving treatment for not one, but two deadly diseases. Scroll down for video . Joyful: Gluta has won over a legion of fans - but her happy expression hides a difficult life . Rescued: Gluta was saved from the streets of Thailand by her now-owner Sorasart Wisetsin . Sick: But it soon became clear the young dog was not at all well - and she was taken to the vets . Infection: The vets found she had a condition called metritis, an inflammation of the uterus wall . Surgery: The condition can be fatal if not treated, so it was decided to remove Gluta's womb . Sorasart first met Gluta when he was staying in a dormitory in Thailand, explaining to her many fans she caught his attention because 'she really was so nice and so neat'. But he wasn't allowed to keep Gluta in his dorm, so Sorasart would meet his companion in the car park outside to feed her. It quickly became clear to him that his new friend was suffering from some medical issues, so he took the dog to the vets. After tests and scans she was diagnosed with metritis, a bacterial infection which inflames the wall of the uterus. If left untreated, it can lead to sterility and even death. Happier times: For a period, it seemed like Gluta was on the road to recovery - but it was not to be . Cancer: She began to go downhill once more, and this time the vets discovered cancer cells in her cervix . Treatment: The canine was forced to undergo several rounds of chemotherapy and laser surgery . Ecstatic: Sorasart then began documenting the happy times he and his beloved pet were sharing . Fans: He set up a Facebook page, a Tumblr and an Instagram account - all dedicated to his pet . Thousands: And soon, the rest of the world came to love Gluta as much as Sorasart had come to .

"Well-known Bay Area rapper The Jacka was shot dead Monday evening while making music with a group of friends in East Oakland, according to a witness. The 37-year-old victim, born Dominic Newton, suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the head at around 8.15pm Pacific Time at 94th Avenue and MacArthur Boulevard. Newton was rushed to Highland Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Scroll down for video . Gunned down: Bay Area rapper Dominic Newton, 37, better known by his stage name The Jacka, was shot dead on an Oakland street Monday night . Crime scene: Newton suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the head at 94th Avenue and MacArthur Boulevard in Oakland . He died doing what he loved: A friend said The Jacka was killed while rapping with a group of friends . So far, police have made no arrests in the shooting. Law enforcement officials are offering a $20,000 reward for information in the case. The site AllMusic reports Newton, a native of Pittsburgh, got his start in hip hop in the late 1990s as part of the group Mob Figaz. In 2001, Newton embarked on a solo career, releasing more than 40 independent albums over the past 14 years. His music was featured in the gritty 2013 police-shooting drama Fruitvale Station, which won the grand jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival that year. The Jacka's latest effort, an album titled What Happened To The World, was released just two months ago. On Monday night, hundreds of The Jacka's fans and fellow artists took to Facebook and Twitter to mourn their loss. Man of God: Newton (left) had converted to Islam in his youth and went by the name Shaheed Akbar. The 37-year-old is pictured here with a fellow rapper and brother in faith Freeway, who mourned him on Instagram . Outpouring of grief: Portland Trailblazers point guard Damian Lillard joined a chorus of condolences on Twitter . Mark of respect: Wu-Tang clan member Raekwon also expressed his heartache and pain . Fellow West Coast rapper Freeway, with whom The Jacka recorded an album last year, wrote a prayer on his Instagram in honor of his friend. ‘O Allah, forgive him and have mercy on him and give him strength and pardon him. Be generous to him and cause his entrance to be wide and wash him with water and snow and hail,’ the performer write. ‘Cleanse him of his transgressions as white cloth is cleansed of stains. Give him an abode better than his home, and a family better than his family and a wife better than his wife. ‘Take him into Paradise and protect him from the punishment of the grave [and from the punishment of Hell-fire].Ameen! Love you bro!!’ According to SF Weekly, Newton had converted to Islam in his youth and went by his Muslim name Shaheed Akbar for most of his adult life. Dominic Newton was born to a 14-year-old mother and a convict father who served 15 years in prison. In an article published by the Bay Area News Group in 2005, he explained that his stage name came from charges of carjacking and stealing. As a young man, he had served one year for grand theft auto and armed robbery. Prolific career: Newton, a native of Pittsburgh, got his start in hip hop in the late 1990s as part of the group Mob Figaz before embarking on a solo career in 2011 . Two weeks ago, Newton posted this picture on his Instagram account showing him with two bags of cannabis he allegedly had purchased from a medical marijuana dispensary . Newton’s friend Reggie Grant, 51, told NBC Bay Area that the rapper died while doing what he love most – making music. According to Grant, just after 8pm Monday night Newton and a group of seven or eight men seated in a parked van were enjoying a jam session when someone opened fire, striking The Jacka in the head. ‘Bullets don't have no name. I don't know who did it,’ said Grant. ‘He had problems with nobody. He'd give you his shoes off his feet. He gave jobs to lots of people.’ Grant said he witnessed his friend draw his last breath as a neighbor held a towel to his head wound. The 37-year-old performer reportedly leaves behind and wife and children. Wu-Tang clan member Raekwon and Portland Trailblazers point guard Damian Lillard joined a chorus of condolences on Twitter, with the NBA star writing: ‘R.I.P to ‘The Jacka’ … Oakland Rap Legend ! Life was taken tonight IN OAKLAND. Got to do better toward our own man.’","Rapper Dominic Newton suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the head and died at the scene in East Oakland Monday .

"With their faces smeared with boot polish these are the men who made up one of the deadliest commando units of the Second World War. They are all members of the 1st Special Service Force - an elite unit made up of American and Canadian soldiers who captured 27,000 enemy prisoners between 1942 and 1944. The legendary special force was tasked with creating havoc behind enemy lines through sabotage and slaughter and laid the foundation for the U.S. navy SEALS and the modern day special forces in Canada. The troop were so feared by the Nazis that they earned the nickname the 'Devil's Brigade' because of their painted faces and stealth tactics. Scroll down for video . Behind enemy lines: The First Special Service Force earned the nickname 'Black Devils' because they smeared their faces with boot polish and murdered Nazis in their sleep. Pictured: being briefed before setting out on patrol at Anzio, Italy, in 1944 . They were nicknamed the 'Devils Brigade' and were feared by the Nazis because of their stealth tactics. Pictured: The unit preparing to go out on an evening patrol in Anzio, Italy, in April 1944 . These crack commandos were trained laid the foundation for the modern special forces in both Canada and the US. Pitured: Sergeant Leonard L.Grew, Privates J.F Bell, and F.A. Murphy sat in a mortar pit om Anzio, Italy . They were the subject of the 1968 movie, 'Devils' Brigade,' starring William Holden and Cliff Robertson and were also said to have inspire Quentin Tarantino's 2009 movie Inglorious Basterds. Surviving members of the crack commando unit are set to be given the Congressional Gold Medal in a ceremony in Washington today — the highest civilian honour the United States Congress can bestow. Canada's Department of Defence released the latest photos of the squad in advance of the ceremony. The Black Devils were formed in 1942 and the 1,800 strong force was primarily made up of volunteers who were previously lumberjacks, forest rangers, hunters and game wardens. At their base in Fort Harrison near Helena, Montana in the United States, they received rigorous and intensive training in stealth tactics, hand-to-hand combat, the use of explosives for demolition, parachuting, amphibious warfare, rock-climbing, mountain warfare, and as ski troops. They even had a specially designed fighting knife made for them called the V-42. During the war they fought across Europe, in the Aleutian Islands,  the Pacific and later in Italy and southern France before being disbanded in December 1944. Devils Brigade on patrol: Staff-Sergeant K.S. Chapman, carrying a Thompson submachine gun; Sergeant T.C. Potenza, carrying a Johnson light machine gun; Sergeant N.J. Overall, carrying a Bazooka; Sergeant T.F. Olynyk, carrying an SCR-536 radio; Sergeant H.W. McCarthy, carrying a Thompson submachine gun (R-L) march during a battle drill at Anzio beachhead, Italy, in late April, 1944 . Members of the First Special Service Force preparing a meal in Anzio, Italy, in April 1944, where they first earned the nickname the 'Devil's Brigade' The first operation in 1942 was codenamed 'Project Plough,' and was described as a 'suicide mission.' They had parachute into German-held Norway to knock out strategic targets such as hydroelectric power plants. But it  was during Operation Shingle in Anzio, Italy, in 1944 that they earned the nickname the 'Black Devil's. They were brought ashore to hold and raid the beachhead, which they did. A journal of a German officer which was found by allies, read: 'The Black Devils are all around us every time we come into the line. We never hear them come.' The men of the Devils Brigade were said also said to have inspire Quentin Tarantino's 2009 movie Inglorious Basterds. Pictured:  Lieut. J. Kostelec (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) (L) and Lieut. H.C. Wilson (Olympia, Washington, USA), wearing the same uniform of the First Special Service Force (also known as the Devil's Brigade) rest on the steps of the Force's Clearing Station, near Venafro, Italy, in January 1944 .

After each successful raid they left a card depicting their unit patch and the phrase 'Das dicke Ende kommt noch' or 'The worst is yet to come . In total they saw only 251 days of combat but the force suffered 2,314 deaths, captured 27,000 prisoners and won five U.S. campaign stars and eight Canadian battle honors. The unit joins the ranks of George Washington and Nelson Mandela as recipients of the highest civilian honour the United States Congress can bestow.

"Australians have proven that they are no strangers to lies and infidelity with one in four admitting to being unfaithful while in a relationship. Among those who have cheated - with kissing and an emotional connection included as a form of deceit - almost two in five have had sex with someone else while in a relationship. The intimate statistics from a recent national survey of 1,025 Aussies coincides with the home entertainment release of the 2014 smash hit movie, Gone Girl, which is based on a web of secrets, lies and adultery. Australians have proven that they are no strangers to lies and infidelity with one in four admitting to being unfaithful while in a relationship . About half of Aussies lie about their past and what they are doing to their partners . Victorians came out on top as the most likely to lie to their partner but are also the first to admit to being unfaithful - hence it's no surprise that are the most forgiving if their partner have had a flirty or ‘emotionally intimate’ relationship with someone. People from NSW are the least likely to give their partners access to their emails, credit cards and bank accounts while Queenslanders have lied the most about where they have been. Meanwhile most admitted to not putting all of their card on the table in relationships with three-quarters of couples habitually keeping secrets and nearly two thirds say that their partner doesn’t know their deepest secret. Relationship psychologist Melissa Keogh said although honesty was always helpful in relationships - it depends on the level of the secret. 'It's also about why you are keeping the secret - if you are going shopping to buy them a present - well that's one thing but it's all about why you are keeping the secret,' she said. Among those who have cheated - with kissing and an emotional connection included as a form of deceit - almost two in five have had sex with someone else while in a relationship . The majority of Aussies lie to their partners once or twice a week, a survey revelas . Dr Keogh said deliberately keeping secrets from partners was a common issue. 'Secrecy is definitely a problem across the board which is worrying,' she said. 'It's good to share in a relationship because it allows the opportunity for intimacy which is fundamental to a good partnership.' But she said it was not essential that people divulge every single detail of their sexual past - as three in five people who participated in the survey admitting they have been dishonest about their sexual history. 'I don't know that we need to be so open with our current partners about out past sexual experiences or how many people either,'she said. 'I don't know if that level of honesty is always helpful in a relationship.' Dr Keogh was not surprised by the statistic that one in four people admitted to cheating on their partner - whether it be sexual, kissing or emotional. 'It's worrying but that's kind of the reality of life - people often admit to kissing or flirting with someone else - or in an intimate or emotional sense - it happens,' she said. People also have different perceptions as to what constitutes being unfaithful. 'Some people don't see kissing as a really big deal and others are devastated by doing that. 'But it also reflects reality that people coming to me and saying they had sex with someone is a minority.' 'All of the things that happen in reality - happen in Gone Girl but the movie is more extreme,' Dr Keogh said. Gone Girl is out now through 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu-ray and DVD.

"Nancy Reagan refused to help dying Hollywood star Rock Hudson get a bed at a French hospital at the forefront of experimental treatment for AIDS, it has been claimed. Then First Lady Mrs Reagan turned down a request from Hudson's publicist for help getting the actor transferred to a French military hospital where he could be seen by Dr Dominique Dormant. Dr Dormant, who had treated Hudson for AIDS months earlier, was at the time working on an early experimental drug that promised to help bolster the immune systems of AIDS sufferers. Scroll down for video . Secret illness: Rock Hudson looks frail and weak as he stands with Liza Minelli and Elizabeth Taylor at the Golden Globes in January 1985, less than nine months before his death from AIDS . Friends in high places: Rock Hudson with Nancy Reagan and her husband Ronald, then U.S. president, at a state dinner in May 1984. Mrs Reagan turned down his request for help getting AIDS treatment in France . Hudson, who had kept secret his homosexuality and his AIDS, was eventually given a bed at the Percy Military Hospital in Clamart - thanks to strings pulled with French officials. But in the end it transpired that his condition had deteriorated so badly that even Dr Dormant's experimental HPA-23 treatments could not help him. He chose to return to Los Angeles and died  just two months later, in October 1985. One of Hollywood's hottest hunks throughout the 1950s and 1960s, 59-year-old Hudson had grown close to Ronald Reagan, the future president who started out an actor, through showbusiness circles. But by the mid-1980s Hudson was no longer the broad-shouldered embodiment of 'the American man'. He was frail and gaunt, and one Sunday evening in July 1985 he collapsed in the Paris Ritz, just hours after arriving in the city. It was a closely guarded secret that Hudson was in the French capital desperately seeking treatment for AIDS, but the doctor he had come to see, Dr Dormant, could not get permission to admit the star to move to the military hospital where he worked, or even to visit him as an outpatient in the American hospital where he was taken after his collapse,  Buzzfeed reports. Rock Hudson in 1985: By the mid-1980s Hudson was no longer the broad-shouldered embodiment of 'the American man', but he was still keeping his illness - and his homosexuality - a secret . Hudson's American publicist Dale Olson sent a desperate telegram to the Reagan White House pleading for help with persuading the French military to allow the actor to be treated, Buzzfeed reports. 'Doctor Dominique Dormant specialist treating Rock Hudson in Paris, reports only one hospital in the world can offer necessary medical treatment to save life of Rock Hudson or at least alleviate his illness. This hospital is Ministere du la Defence Centre d’Researches du Service de Sante des Armees Percy Hospital in the city of Clamart,' said the telegram, discovered in the Reagan Presidential Library and seen by Buzzfeed. 'Commanding general of Percy Hospital has turned down Rock Hudson as a patient because he is not French. Doctor Dormant in Paris believes a request from the White House or a high American official would change his mind. Can you help by having someone call the commanding general’s office at the Percy Hospital at the above number.' But Mrs Reagan, acting on the advice of deputy press secretary Mark Weinberg, turned down the request. Heart-throb: Actor Rock Hudson pictured left at the height of his fame in 1959. Right is a scene showing Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson from the 1955 film All That Heaven Allows . Hudson with Doris Day: The pair starred together in several Hollywood romantic comedies in the 1960s . Mr Weinberg told Buzzfeed he recommended that Mrs Reagan refer to the matter to the U.S. Embassy in France in an effort to be seen to 'be fair and not do anything that would appear to favor personal friends.' Insisting the decision had nothing to do with AIDS policy, he said the Reagans' view was 'Well, we're so sorry', but the couple 'were about treating everybody the same' and didn't want to make exceptions for friends. But the decision came at a time of virulent homophobia in the U.S., where conservatives in particular had come to see the AIDS epidemic as a gay plague sent by God as a punishment for homosexuality. Peter Staley, a prominent activist for AIDS awareness and treatment, told Buzzfeed the Reagans' excuse seemed 'strange', since they often did favours for their friends while in power. 'I’m sure if it had been Bob Hope in that hospital with some rare, incurable cancer, Air Force One would have been dispatched to help save him,' he said. 'There’s no getting around the fact that they left Rock Hudson out to dry. As soon as he had that frightening homosexual disease, he became as unwanted and ignored as the rest of us.'","Actor sought a bed at French hospital at forefront of AIDS treatment .

"Michael Land fraudulently obtained £42,000 in benefits payments and claimed that he was blind, while working as a driving instructor . A benefit cheat pocketed £42,000 in benefits he claimed for being blind, while working as a driving instructor. Fraudster Michael Land - who once weighed 420lb - also said he was unable to work because he could barely walk and needed a wheelchair. Infant Land, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, was teaching learner drivers for seven years and bought a £21,000 caravan with the money he stole. The 44-year-old also worked as a scout leader. Land was jailed for 12 months after admitting nine counts of benefit fraud. Leeds Crown Court heard Land lied to authorities that his eye sight had failed due to glaucoma, that he was suffering from diabetes and that he was unable to walk more than 30ft. The former nurse also made false claims that he needed a wheelchair, had severe breathing difficulties and required his wife's help to get out of a chair. Land made the false declarations to the Department of Work and Pensions between October 2006 and May 2013 to obtain £42,203 in incapacity benefit, disability living allowance, tax credits and housing and council tax benefit. During that period Land registered with the Driving Standards Agency as an instructor. Prosecutor Simon Clegg said the father-of-two worked on an independent basis as well as for reputable firms including Drive Dynamic, Red Driving School and Bill Plant Ltd. Mr Clegg told the court: 'The defendant was paid as someone who was not able to work, but also as someone who required care and and assistance with mobility. 'He was also paid benefits as someone not in receipt of a pension.' The court heard Land was able to buy a caravan worth £21,000 during the time he received benefits. Land worked on an independent basis as a driving instructor as well as for reputable firms including Drive Dynamic, Red Driving School, seen above, and Bill Plant Ltd . Mitigating Kara Frith said Land, of Holt Park, was ashamed of his offending and had pleaded guilty at an early opportunity. She said Land, who had previously undergone a gastric bypass, initially made legitimate claims for benefits but then began to 'exaggerate' his claims. She described Land as a man who had worked hard to obtain a nursing degree but his career in the profession ended following a breakdown. The lawyer said Land was devastated at not being able to return to nursing or his role as a scout leader because of his convictions for dishonesty offences. Referring to the false claims, judge Sally Cahill, QC, said: 'This was not just exaggeration - this was fabrication.'","Michael Land claimed he could barely walk and suffered from glaucoma .

"The widow of former spy Alexander Litvinenko has described the final moments she spent with her husband after he died in hospital. Marina Litvinenko revealed the harrowing moment doctors told her the former KGB agent had died from polonium poisoning. She told an inquiry that she was then allowed to enter his hospital room without protective gloves and could kiss and touch her husband. Scroll down for video . Warning: Alexander Litvinenko was told to prepare his will four years before he died of radiation poisoning . Mr Litvinenko's wife Marina leaves the Royal Courts of Justice today after giving evidence at an inquiry into her husband's death . She said: 'The doctor said Sasha had passed away. ""Would you like to see Sasha?"" he asked. I said, ""Of course"". 'When we went into his room it was so different. We didn’t need protective gloves. I could touch him. I could kiss him. This time no one said it was dangerous; nobody told me not to do so.' Her account came as shocking video was revealed showing Russian special forces using a photograph of Mr Litvinenko for target practice. The footage shows agents tackling an assault course and firing their weapons at a shooting range before an image of Mr Litvinenko's face is shown, appearing to be the target and riddled with bullet holes. The video, which was thought to have been filmed before his death, comes as it was revealed that Mr Litvinenko was warned he was at risk of assassination and told 'get your will ready' four years before he died from radiation poisoning. A video was shown at the inquiry today showing Russian Special Forces training during target practice . The footage also appeared to show that an image of Mr Litvinenko's face was being used during target practice and appeared riddled with bullet holes . A former colleague from the Russian secret service sent an email to the dissident telling him he had been 'sentenced to extrajudicial elimination' in October 2002, the hearing was told. Giving evidence today, Mr Litvinenko's widow wept as she told the court her husband's last words were, 'I love you so much.' Mrs Litvinenko kept a daily bedside vigil as her husband deteriorated from a 'healthy and good looking man' to a dying patient whose vital organs were failing fast. During one visit she stroked his head only for clumps of hair to fall out in her hand and onto the pillow. And on the day before he died Mrs Litvinenko, 52, told her husband that she had to leave because she needed to get home to care for their son Anatoly. The former KGB agent then 'smiled so sadly' and whispered: 'I love you very much.' Mrs Litvinenko was joined at the hearing by her son Anatoly, who also told the inquiry about the moment he was told his father had died . At the hearing and giving evidence, Mrs Litvinenko wept as she recalled her husband's last words to her were 'I love you so much' In an attempt to keep her husband's spirits up, she joked: 'Oh finally. I've not heard this for a long time. I'm so happy. I'll see you tomorrow.' Breaking down in tears, she told the public inquiry into her husband's death: 'It was his last words that I heard.' Mr Litvinenko, 43, converted to Islam on his deathbed so that he could be buried in Chechen soil, the hearing was told. He died at University College Hospital in November 2006, three weeks after he was poisoned by drinking tea laced with polonium during a meeting with two Russians. Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun have been named as the two main suspects in Mr Litvinenko's death, but both have denied any involvement and refused to give evidence at the inquiry. Fatal: Mr Litvinenko drank polonium-laced tea during a meeting at the Millennium Hotel, pictured . Suspects: Dmitri Kovtun, left, and Andrei Lugovoi, right, have been accused of murdering the Russian spy . Today the hearing was shown a video clip of the Russian dissident publicly blaming Vladimir Putin for the murder of a prominent Russian journalist weeks before his own death. Mr Litvinenko was seen addressing a meeting at the Frontline Club in which he claims Putin opponent Anna Politkovskaya had been murdered at the orders of the Russian president. Standing up and holding a microphone, he speaks in Russian and a member of the panel he is addressing translates his comments into English. 'Mr Putin murdered her,' he says. After being poisoned he signed a statement written for him by his friend and solicitor in which he blamed Mr Putin for his death, his widow told the inquiry. Accusation: Mr Litvinenko accused Vladimir Putin of a string of serious crimes . Mrs Litvinenko said the day her husband fell ill - November 1, 2006 - the couple had celebrated the anniversary of their arrival in the UK with a home-cooked meal. He fell ill that evening, vomiting frequently and experiencing diarrhoea and bleeding, the inquiry heard, but it was not until a few days later he was taken to Barnet hospital. Mrs Litvinenko earlier described the moment her husband, who she affectionately knew as Sasha, started to lose his hair as she ran her fingers across his head. They decided to remove his hair completely and were able to do so by hand it was falling out so easily, she told the inquiry. Mrs Litvinenko said her husband was baptised into the Russian Orthodox church but following a conversation with exiled Chechen leader Akhmed Zakayev, he decided to convert to Islam in hospital. She told the inquiry he wanted to be buried in Chechen soil, which prompted his decision. An imam was brought to the hospital for a ceremony that lasted a few minutes. Mrs Litvinenko denied the suggestion that her husband could have inadvertently poisoned himself while obtaining polonium. 'It's not possible from my point of view,' she said. 'Sasha was a very legal person. It's illegal and he will not do any illegal things in this country.' Yesterday, she told the inquiry that her husband had accused Mr Putin of having links with criminal gangs during his time as mayor of St Petersburg. Mr Litvinenko fled Russia in 2000 after turning on the Russian secret service when he was asked to kill tycoon Boris Berezovsky, who later became a close friend of his. On arriving at Heathrow Airport with his wife and  Anatoly, he went up to a policeman and said: 'I'm a KGB officer and I'm asking for political asylum.' During his time living in Britain he continued his opposition to Mr Putin's regime, and shortly before his death he accused the Russian president of being a paedophile. The hearing continues. The son of former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko told the inquiry he never truly believed his father would die. Anatoly Litvinenko, now aged 20, gave evidence into the public inquiry into his father's death saying he was proud to be a British citizen. Dressed in a suit and a tie, Mr Litvinenko, who was 12 when his father was poisoned, recalled visiting the hospital on the day of his death. He said: 'Before this point I never truly believed my father would die. I was young and optimistic and I thought he would recover.' Anatoly Litvinenko, the son of former Russian intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko at the Royal Courts of Justice today. He told an inquiry into his father's death that he never truly believed his father would die . Mr Litvinenko was told his father had died on November 1 2006 at University College Hospital and was then taken into the room where his body was laid out. He added: 'This hit me hard but at the same time I felt quite numb. 'It was very painful to look at him in the state he was in.' Mr Litvinenko was not aware his father had worked for Russian intelligence services before coming to the UK, nor that he had been working for British security services. He believed his father was a journalist writing for the Chechen press, the inquiry heard. He added: 'I understood why he disliked Russia. I understood why he liked England and I understood his sentiments towards Chechnya.' Asked by counsel to the inquiry Robin Tam QC about occasions when Mr Litvinenko spoke to him about Britain, Mr Litvinenko said: 'He was always going on about the integrity of this nation. The honesty. The transparency with which judicial processes are carried out. 'The honesty of the police and the deep contrast with the regime in which he grew up in and the system in which he served.'","Inquiry was shown footage showing Russian Special Forces training .

"Scroll down for video . One of the world’s largest airlines is reportedly looking at cramming more seats onto a new subfleet of Boeing 777 aircraft, meaning its economy class passengers would have even less space than before. A high-density configuration would see United Airlines install up to 364 seats on each retrofitted plane, almost 100 more than it currently has on many of its three-class 777s, Aviation Week reported. The Chicago-based carrier would add a seat to every row in economy – bringing the total to ten per row – and shrink the size of its business class while leaving its premium economy class untouched with nine seats per row. Many new Boeing 777s are being built with ten seats per row in economy class cabins . Passengers are pictured on board an Emirates Boeing 777 which seats 10 passengers per row . Aviation Week spoke to an anonymous source and quoted airline documents that reveal a proposal to have 28 seats in business class, 98 in premium economy and 238 in economy on some aircraft. It did not say how many planes would be retrofitted, but added that many new 777s built by Boeing have 10 seats per row in economy. Under that configuration the middle section has four or five seats in each row while each outside section has two or three seats. A United Airlines spokesman declined to comment on the report. He told MailOnline Travel: ‘We evaluate lots of options across our fleet and haven’t made any further announcements specific to the 777 fleet.’ Inside a Boeing 777 economy class cabin which seats nine across; many new planes seat ten across . According to United’s website it has four versions of the Boeing 777-200. Two versions fly between the US and Europe with eight seats in first class, 40 in business, 110 or 113 in economy plus, and 108 in economy for a total of 266 or 269. A third version seats 50 in business, 72 in premium economy, and 145 in economy (267 in total) The fourth version flies to Hawaii, carrying 32 in first class, 98 in premium economy and 214 in economy (344 total passengers). The seat pitch (the space between seats) on all of United’s Boeing 777s is 32in while the seat width is 18in or 18.3in. Bob Atkinson, travel expert at TravelSupermarket, said if United changes its configuration to ten abreast in economy it will likely do so on routes where it doesn’t have a lot of traffic in its pricier business class. He said: ‘If there’s not a lot of high-revenue business it allows (an airline) to obviously drive additional revenue by getting more bums in the seats in economy at a price that people are more willing to pay.’ He said the seat pitch isn’t likely to change when an airline goes from nine seats in a row to ten, but the seat width will shrink. ‘If you can cope with a narrower seat, and many people can, it probably won’t make a huge amount of difference.’ Air France, American Airlines, Emirates, Etihad and Japan Airlines are among the carriers which currently have ten seats per row on all or some of their Boeing 777s. When an airline adds a seat to every row in economy it doesn’t necessarily translate into cheaper fares for consumers, said Mr Atkinson.","Aviation Week said the configuration would see up to 364 seats installed .

"Arthur Hutchinson was sentenced to life for the murders of Basil Laitner, his wife Avril and their 28-year-old son Richard . Locking up Britain’s most evil criminals until they die does not breach their human rights, European judges ruled yesterday. In a major victory for Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, Strasbourg backed ‘whole life’ prison sentences for horrific murders and other heinous crimes. The European Court of Human Rights dismissed an appeal by a notorious triple killer against his ‘life means life’ tariff. Arthur Hutchinson, 74, stabbed a bride’s parents and brother to death on her wedding night and repeatedly raped a teenage house guest in a frenzied attack in October 1983. The ruling means notorious prisoners, including Moors murderer Ian Brady and Mark Bridger, the paedophile killer of five-year-old April Jones, can be kept behind bars indefinitely. After the decision, Mr Grayling said: ‘Those who commit the most heinous crimes deserve to spend the rest of their lives in prison. ‘That is what the public want, and it is right that judges will continue to be able to hand down whole life orders to the very worst offenders.’ The ruling was a significant retreat for the European court’s grand chamber, which in July 2013 ruled that whole life terms were ‘inhuman and degrading’ and should be reviewed after 25 years. It had claimed the lack of a proper review and hence the lack of hope, however remote, of eventual release was a major breach of prisoners’ human rights. But Britain’s Court of Appeal said last February that the European court was wrong and ruled killers could potentially be released at the discretion of the Justice Secretary if ‘exceptional grounds’ existed, for example if they were terminally ill. Yesterday, the Strasbourg-based court agreed and threw out Hutchinson’s appeal – ruling that his whole-life sentence did not violate the European Convention on Human Rights. It said Britain had ‘specifically addressed’ the issue and that the legal situation was ‘in line with human rights laws’. Double police killer  Dale Cregan (left) and Mark Bridger (right), who murdered five-year-old April Jones, are serving life sentences . The ruling is a further sign that the European courts are stepping back from interfering in British laws. It is also an important boost for the Conservative Party in the run-up to May’s General Election. Stinging criticism by MPs and ministers of meddling by Strasbourg appeared to have had some influence on the latest ruling, which may stem a drift of voters to Ukip. European judges who strayed beyond their original brief were cited by the Tories in proposals published last year to claw back sovereignty and scrap the Human Rights Act in favour of a British bill of rights. If the Government had lost the latest case it could have opened the way for parole hearings by Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper (left) and  Ian Brady, the Moors Murderer (right) Dominic Raab, a Tory MP campaigning for reform of human rights legislation, said: ‘It’s welcome that this Government stood firm and Strasbourg has performed a U-turn. ‘But it also highlights the intensely political instincts of a court that meddles when it thinks it can get away with it. That’s why we need Conservative reforms of our relationship with Strasbourg, to safeguard the democratic right of our Supreme Court to have the last word on British justice.’ Last week Strasbourg judges agreed it was lawful to extradite to the US a terror suspect accused of being Abu Hamza’s trusted sidekick. And last August they saved British taxpayers millions by saying prisoners barred from voting should not get compensation. Frenzied attack: Arthur Hutchinson . Arthur Hutchinson carried out the bloody slaughter of Basil Laitner’s family at their home in October 1983. The 59-year-old solicitor, his wife Avril, 55, and son Richard, 28, were all murdered on the day they spent celebrating the wedding of daughter Suzanne. Armed with an eight-inch bowie knife, Hutchinson – nicknamed ‘The Fox’ – broke into the wealthy family’s home in Sheffield to carry out the killings. He then grabbed hold of an 18-year-old woman who was staying at the house, forced her to walk through a pool of blood, took her to a marquee in the grounds and raped her. Hutchinson was captured after weeks on the run and convicted thanks to the rape victim’s testimony and a wealth of forensic evidence, including his palm print on a bottle of wedding champagne. The judge in his 1984 trial at Sheffield Crown Court said he should serve 18 years but Home Secretary Leon Brittan later ruled he should face a whole life tariff. Before the latest ruling ministers had been forced to consider scrapping ‘life means life’ sentences completely. Instead of being told they must die in prison, it was thought offenders could be given an American-style jail sentence of up to 100 years that would have been subject to review. Fifty-five inmates in England and Wales are serving whole life tariffs, including Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe, Rosemary West and one-eyed police killer Dale Cregan. The longest serving whole life prisoner is Ian Brady, who committed the Moors Murders between 1963 and 1965. He is 76.","Triple killer Arthur Hutchinson loses challenge against 'life means life' term .

"A compound  in green tea has been found to kill mouth cancer cells while leaving healthy cells undamaged. While it was known the drink could help fight the disease, scientists say they have now worked out why. The breakthrough involved identifying the process by which the substance attacks cancer cells. This, it is hoped, will lead to new treatments for oral cancer, as well as other forms of the disease. A compound found in green tea has been found to kill off oral cancer cells, while leaving healthy cells undamaged. Scientists at Penn State have now identified how the process targets the disease . Scientists at Penn State University, in the US, explored the specific mechanism by which the green tea compound is able to target the diseased cells. Earlier studies have shown that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a compound found in green tea, killed mouth cancer cells without harming normal cells. But researchers did not understand the reasons behind the substance's ability to kill the cancer cells. Scientists now believe EGCG may trigger a process in the mitochondria - the powerhouse of a cell that produces energy - that leads to cell death. Professor Joshua Lambert, a specialist in food science and co-director of Penn State's Center for Plant and Mushroom Foods for Health, said: 'EGCG is doing something to damage the mitochondria. 'That mitochondrial damage sets up a cycle causing more damage and it spirals out, until the cell undergoes programmed cell death. 'It looks like EGCG causes the formation of reactive oxygen species in cancer cells, which damages the mitochondria, and the mitochondria responds by making more reactive oxygen species.' Reactive oxygen species are chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen. They play an important role in cell signalling and homeostatsis - the control of internal conditions including temperature. When reactive oxygen species levels increase dramatically, it can cause significant damage to cell structures - this is known as oxidative stress. As this mitochondrial demise continues, the cancer cell also reduces the expression of antioxidant genes, further lowering its defences. Mouth cancer - including cancer of the lips, tongue, pictured under the microscope, and cheek lining - is common in people over the age of 45 and is typically caused by smoking and heavy drinking . 'So, it's turning off its mechanism of protection at the same time that EGCG is causing this oxidative stress,' Professor Lambert added. His team discovered the EGCG did not cause the same reaction in normal cells. In fact, the compound appeared to increase the healthy cell's protective capabilities. The researchers studied normal human oral cells, alongside human oral cancer cells, to determine how the compound was targeting the cancer cells differently to those healthy tissues. They grew the normal and cancer cells on petri dishes, before exposing them to EGCG - the major polyphenol found in green tea. Mouth cancer is more common in people aged over 45, and the disease affects more women. Oral cancers include, cancer of the lips, tongue, gums, inside lining of the cheeks and lips, floor of the mouth under the tongue, roof of the mouth and the area behind the wisdom teeth. The main causes of mouth cancer are smoking and drinking heavily, but the risk increases if a person does both. Eating a poor diet, not cleaning your teeth properly and failing to see a dentist regularly can all increase the risk. Two of the most common symptoms are an ulcer in the mouth that doesn't heal and discomfort or pain in the mouth that doesn't subside. Other symptoms include a white or red patch in the mouth, a lump or thickening on the lip. difficulty or pain chewing, swallowing or speaking, bleeding or numbness in the mouth, a lump in the neck, weight loss and bad breath. Source: Macmillan Cancer Support . They used concentrations of the compound typically found in the saliva after a person chews green tea gum. At specific times the scientists collected the cells to check for oxidative stress and signs of antioxidant response. Professor Lambert, said: 'We also took a lot of pictures, so we could use fluorescent dyes that measure mitochondrial function and oxidative stress and actually see these things develop.' His team identified a protein called sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is critical to the process. 'It plays an important role in mitochondrial function and in antioxidant response in lots of tissues in the body, so the idea that EGCG might selectively affect the activity of sirtuin 3 in cancer cells - to turn it off - and in normal cells - to turn it on - is probably applicable in multiple kinds of cancers,' said Professor Lambert. This study builds on past research into how the compound affects oral cancer, a disease expected to kill more than 8,000 people in the US this year. 'We've published one paper previously just looking at the effect of these green tea polyphenols on oral cancer cells in cultures,' said Professor Lambert. 'And there have been other papers published using oral cancer cells and at least a couple of animal model studies that have looked at oral cancer and prevention of oral cancer.' He said the next step would be to study the mechanism in animals. If those tests and human trials were then successful, the scientists hope to create cancer treatments that are as effective as current ones, but without the harmful side effects. Professor Lambert added: 'The problem with a lot of chemotherapy drugs - especially early chemotherapy drugs - is that they really just target rapidly dividing cells, so cancer divides rapidly, but so do cells in your hair follicles and cells in your intestines, so you have a lot of side effects. 'But you don't see these sorts of side effects with green tea consumption.' The study, supported by the American Institute for Cancer Research, was published in the online issue of Molecular Nutrition and Food Research.","Compound EGCG kills mouth cancer cells leaving healthy ones alone .

"A schoolgirl was found slumped in a wardrobe by her twin sister after accidentally strangling herself with a dressing gown cord. Grace Taylor, 13, had been cleaning her bedroom minutes before her sister Ellen walked in and discovered her unconscious body. The ‘beautiful and kind’ teenager died in hospital two days later despite efforts to revive her. Grace, right, was found by her twin-sister Ellen, left, who went to check on her after tidying her own room . The unusual nature of her death prompted police to launch an investigation, following suspicions that she may have been bullied. But after the investigation ruled out any intimidation and found no evidence the schoolgirl was planning to commit suicide, a coroner said the death was accidental. Only hours before the tragedy, Grace had discussed going on holiday with her family before her mother asked the twins to clean their rooms. After tidying for ten minutes while listening to music, Ellen walked in to check on her sister and found her leaning in to the cupboard. She initially thought her sister was playing a joke before she realised that her sister was unconscious and ran to her parents for help. Her mother Christine told Newcastle Coroner’s Court that her daughter looked as if she had ‘slipped’ and was ‘leaning’ into the cord. Grace Taylor, 13, accidentally strangled herself with a dressing gown cord in her wardrobe at the family home in Birtley, Gateshead . When an ambulance arrived at the family home in Birtley, Gateshead, they found the schoolgirl with no pulse but managed to restore her circulation before taking her to hospital. Doctors at Gateshead’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital pronounced her dead two days later after she showed no signs of recovery. Dr Grace Williamson, a consultant paediatrician, said: ‘There had been a significant period of cardiac arrest due to lack of oxygen for more than 20 minutes. The brain had swollen as a result.’ The family welcomed the coroner’s accidental death verdict. Grace was a 'beautiful, kind and feisty little girl. She was just a great kid', her father said . The unusual nature of her death prompted police to launch an investigation, following suspicions that she may have been bullied. Above, the street where she lived in Gateshead . Grace’s father Mike, a company director, said Ellen was coping ‘the best she can’ since her sister’s death in November last year and was being supported by her brother Alex, 18. Mr Taylor, 41, said: ‘Grace was a beautiful, kind and feisty little girl. She was just a great kid.’ Mrs Taylor, an insurance worker, said after the inquest: ‘This doesn’t make anything any easier but it does confirm what we already knew all along – she wouldn’t have taken her own life.’ The schoolgirl studied at Lord Lawson of Beamish Academy, where she was predicted strong grades and was a keen sportswoman. After the tragedy, Grace’s mobile phone, computer and iPad were examined by police. But Detective Sergeant Tanya Robinson from Northumbria Police told the inquest that an investigation found no evidence of mental health problems, bullying or suicidal planning. Coroner Karen Dilks concluded: ‘There is no evidence that could satisfy me that Grace intended her actions.’","Grace Taylor , 13, was cleaning her room at her home in Birtley, Gateshead .

"The girlfriend of victim Odin Lloyd broke down in tears on the stand at Aaron Hernandez's murder trial today as she recalled the middle-of-the-night call which brought news that her boyfriend was dead. Shaneah Jenkins, the sister of Hernandez's fiancée Shayanna, also testified on Tuesday about her sister's 'secretive' behavior in the hours after Lloyd's body was found on June 17, 2013, in industrial scrub land close to the football player's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. Hernandez, a former Patriots tight-end, is accused of the murder of Odin Lloyd, a semi-pro football player. He has pleaded not guilty. Scroll down for video . Shaneah Jenkins, the sister of Hernandez's fiancée Shayanna, broke down on the stand on Tuesday when she described the last time she saw her boyfriend Odin Lloyd before her was murdered . Miss Jenkins, who has given composed, measured responses broke down when she described the phone call from a police officer to tell her Odin was dead. Right, alleged murderer Aaron Hernandez is pictured in court on Tuesday . Miss Jenkins, a graduate law student, told the court in Fall River that she had a close relationship with her sister but that Shayanna 'was not being normal' the morning after Odin's murder. Shaneah, who had gone to her sister's house following her boyfriend's death, said that Shayanna took a number of phone calls in another room at her home and then went to the basement several times, on the last occasion carrying a black garbage bag. Shaneah, who is a witness for the prosecution, said that Hernandez, 25, only briefly spoke to her once about her 27-year-old boyfriend's untimely death. Neither Shayanna Jenkins nor other supporters of the defendant were in court today during Miss Jenkins' testimony. Prosecutors have listed Shayanna Jenkins, who has a young daughter with Hernandez, as a possible witness and this month petitioned the court to grant immunity to her. That could compel her to testify. 'He [Hernandez] came into the dining room, rubbed my shoulder and asked me if I was okay,' Miss Jenkins said. 'He told me he had been through this death thing before and it will get better with time.' Hernandez remained emotionless and stared at the ceiling as Miss Jenkins, who had been dating Lloyd for 18 months, became tearful as she recalled the last time she spoke to him. Miss Jenkins said that she spoke to Odin several times on June 16, which was Father's Day, from her home in Connecticut. Odin told her that he was going to work the following day and he had to return a rental car after he finished. During her morning commute the following day, she called Odin at 7.30am but was unable to reach him. Miss Jenkins testified that she called him at lunchtime, got no response and again, at 8pm that night. Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez pictured in court last Thursday at his murder trial  in Fall River, Massachusetts. The former Pats player is accused of killing Odin Lloyd (pictured on the screen) Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancée, looks on in court on Thursday during opening statements. Her sister Shaneah told the court today that her sister was behaving strangely the day after Odin Lloyd's murder . Shaneah was woken up late that night by Trooper Benson from North Attleboro who informed her that Odin was dead. The law student, who has remained composed and given measured, articulate answers on the stand, broke down as she recalled finding out he had died. Miss Jenkins dabbed at her nose and eyes with a tissue but was able to continue. She testified that in the early hours of June 18, she tried to call Shayanna but couldn't get through to her sister. Shayanna then called back and 'sounded like she was in the car', Shaneah said. The grieving young woman then drove from her home in Connecticut to visit Odin's family in Massachusetts and some hours later, then drove to her sister's home about an hour away. Shaneah testified that on June 18, Hernandez left the home and she stayed in the living room for some hours with her sister, niece and uncle. Sometime around noon, Shayanna received a number of phone calls and text messages. 'Her responses were short and she kept getting up and leaving the room,' Miss Jenkins said. 'She was not behaving normally. She was being secretive.' Shaneah said Shayanna went to basement two or three times. On the last time she went, she had a black garbage bag which she did not explain what was for. Shayanna then borrowed Shaneah's car - which she had never done before, saying that she had to go to the bank to collect money for the housekeepers. When her sister returned, Shaneah said she then left to visit Odin's family and on her return, found police searching the Hernandez home. She said that Hernandez's behavior following the police search 'was a little stressed but normal'. The trial continues.","Shaneah Jenkins wept for the first time on the stand as she recalled how a police officer told her over the phone about Odin Lloyd's death .

"As the harsh winter looks set to cause disruption and delay to airports throughout the country, Ryanair staff relieved their boredom - by drawing a lewd picture in the snow. The picture was snapped by a passenger at Dublin Airport, and has since gone viral on social networks, showing just how the no-frills airline likes to get its thrills. Despite the freezing temperatures and evident dismay of staff and customers, the members of staff still showed off their artistic skill right outside the terminal window, even appearing to look up at spectators. Ryanair staff took advantage of the poor weather by drawing a giant penis into the snow at Dublin Airport . A spokesman for Ryanair told MailOnline Travel: 'While our ground crew excel at industry leading 25 minute turnarounds, art isn’t their forte, as they’ve clearly forgotten to draw wings on their snow airplane.' It's something you might expect as a high-school prank, however, the design has been well received on Twitter. One user, Lisa Domican, even went as far as to say the design was 'better than Banksy'. The Irish humour was heralded by Gav as he wrote: 'Oh, Ireland. Don't ever change!' However, some users used the circulating photograph to aim a dig at the company's boss Michael O'Leary. Galileo wrote that in their opinion the drawing shows what the 'Ryanair staff think of their boss', while this sentiment was also echoed by Jim Fitzpatrick. Ryanair has launched a charm offensive in recent months as it seeks to improve its customer relations. Fees for extra baggage and boarding cards at the airports have been cut significantly, and passengers are now allowed to carry a 'smaller' second bag on board. And in June last year the company announced new family product, Ryanair Family Extra, offering families a range of discounts on travel and an improved service on Ryanair flights. The charm offensive is clearly paying off, with the controversial budget airline posting £37million profits for the last quarter, well above analyst expectations.","Photograph was snapped at Dublin Airport from the departure lounge .

"Reports that Google is planning to launch an  Uber rival took a turn late last night when the tech giant took to Twitter to reply to the claims. Bloomberg Business tweeted that Google and Uber are 'going to war over taxis', to which Google's official handle replied: 'We think you'll find Uber and Lyft work quite well. We use them all the time.' This fuelled speculation as the reply was neither a confirmation nor a denial of the rumours. It also came on the same day Uber hinted it was working on its own range of self-driving cars. Bloomberg Business tweeted that Google and Uber are 'going to war over taxis', to which Google's official handle replied: 'We think you'll find Uber and Lyft work quite well. We use them all the time.'  This has fuelled speculation - because the reply is neither a confirmation, or a denial of the reports . This range would directly compete with Google's autonomous vehicles. In a blog post, Uber said it would be partnering with roboticists at Carnegie Mellon University to create a centre devoted to research and development of mapping, car safety, and 'autonomous technology'. 'As a global leader in urban transportation, we have the unique opportunity to invest in leading edge technologies to enable the safe and efficient movement of people and things at giant scale,' Uber chief product officer Jeff Holden said. In addition to the rumours and Twitter exchanges, taxi app Hailo announced it had partnered with Google for its Now cards. Now cards are information boxes that appear in the Google app and offer tailored information at the right time. The Hailo card will offer users the chance to order a cab home when they leave the office work, for example. For people who have opted in to Google Now and have downloaded the Hailo app, the taxi company will send a Now card alert to anyone who has booked a journey from outer London zones in to Central London between 7am and 10am, and an offer a cab home if the passenger is in the same location after 5pm. 'This collaboration and the creation of the Uber Advanced Technologies Center represent an important investment in building for the long term of Uber.' Uber lets consumers use an app to locate a driver and instantly book a ride. Google was an early backer of the San Francisco-based firm, investing $258 million (£170 million) in the controversial ride-sharing service through its venture capital arm in August 2013. David Drummond, Google’s chief legal officer and senior vice president of corporate development, then joined the Uber board of directors. Google Maps software is already integrated into Uber to let users check progress of drivers on their way to pick them up. But, an unnamed source told Bloomberg that Google is preparing to offer its own service, and it was likely to use its driverless cars. The report continued that Mr Drummond had told Uber's board of this possibility, and executives had seen screenshots of what appears to be a Google ride-sharing app, currently being used by employees. The news came on the same day Uber hinted it was working on its own range of self-driving cars. In a blog post, the taxi app (pictured) said it would be partnering with roboticists at Carnegie Mellon University to create a centre devoted to research and development of mapping, car safety, and 'autonomous technology' San Francisco-based Uber has grown into one of the world's largest startups, and now operates in more than 200 cities in 54 countries around the world. But the app's growth has also cause friction with existing taxi operations, and posed challenges for regulators. Uber does not employ drivers or own its vehicles, but instead uses independent contractors with their own cars. Since launching in 2010, Uber has also been dubbed a prime example of a 'disruptive' economic force, and taxi drivers in dozens of cities have staged protests against the firm. This range would directly compete with Google's autonomous vehicles (pictured with Google Chairman Eric Schmidt (left) and  US Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx (right).

"The man who stabbed three soldiers outside a Jewish community centre in Nice today, was apprehended in Turkey last week while  en-route to join ISIS, authorities believe. Moussa Coulibaly, 30, was arrested at Istanbul airport and deported back to France after border control became suspicious, a security source has said. His shares the last name of Amedy Coulibaly, who took hostages in a kosher supermarket in Paris and gunned down a policewoman last month. The surname is relatively common among families of Malian descent, but anti-terrorist police have confirmed they are 'investigating a link' between the pair. Scroll down for video . Attack: The three soldiers were patrolling a Jewish community centre in Nice, on the French Riviera when a man named as Moussa Coulibaly, 30, attacked them with a knife, injuring two in the face and one in the arm . Coulibaly was detained after the attack, near the Galeries Lafayette department store, and a second man has since been arrested by police. The attack took place in central Nice around 2pm this afternoon, after Coulibaly had been fined for travelling on the tram without a ticket. He 'paid the fine without flinching and then rushed at the soldiers,' The Local reports. Coulibaly then pulled an eight-inch blade out of a bag and set upon one of the soldiers, injuring him in the chin, police said. Coulibaly then swiped at two other soldiers - injuring one in the cheek, and the other in the forearm - before being apprehended by riot police stationed near the building. Terrorist suspect: Coulibaly was arrested at Istanbul airport last week, and deported back to France, as authorities believed he was en-route to join ISIS . Possible coincidence: Although the named attacker carries the same name as Kosher deli gunman Amedy Coulibaly, the surname is relatively common for families of Malian descent .

He has a record of theft and violence, but the motive for the attack is not yet clear, an anonymous police official said. The attack took place outside a Jewish community centre in Nice, home to an Israeli association and a Jewish radio station. A manager at the center, who did not want to be identified because she was afraid, confirmed soldiers posted in front of the building were attacked. She said it happened around lunchtime and no one was inside the office. France has been on high alert since the attacks in the Paris region by three Islamic extremists that left 20 people dead, including the gunmen. More than 10,000 soldiers have been deployed around the country to protect sensitive locations, including major shopping areas, synagogues, mosques and transit hubs. Injuries: The man stabbed one solider in the chin before swiping at the two others, injuring one in the cheek and the other in the forearm . Protection: Security Police Forces stand guard outside the Jewish Community Center in Nice today . Unprovoked: The attack took place in central Nice around 2pm this afternoon, after Coulibaly had been fined for travelling on the tram without a ticket . Earlier Tuesday, French authorities arrested seven men and a woman suspected of involvement in a network sending fighters to join ISIS in Syria. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said those arrested in the Paris and Lyon areas are not suspected of links to the attacks against a kosher grocery and newspaper Charlie Hebdo in January. Three of those arrested Tuesday had traveled to Syria and returned in December 2014, a French official said, though it was unclear whether they joined the Islamic State group or another group. The network began sending French fighters to Syria in May 2013, and at least one of them was killed there, the official said. Other members of the network are still in Syria. The group did not appear to be involved in any particular plot, or linked to any other networks already broken up in France in recent months, said the official, who was not authorized to be publicly identified discussing security matters. France has seen hundreds of homegrown radicals join extremists abroad, most linked to ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Cazeneuve said recent atrocities by the Islamic State group - including the killing of a Japanese hostage - 'only strengthen the government's determination to fight terrorism every day and every hour.' French authorities have come under criticism for being overzealous in cracking down on potential threats since the attacks, arresting dozens for comments seen as defending terrorism and notably questioning an eight-year-old boy.","Three soldiers stabbed outside Jewish Community centre in Nice .

"You might hope for a shed at the bottom of your garden. Perhaps even a barn, if the estate is especially impressive. But a property currently on sale on Scotland's east coast goes one better. For your  £750,000, you will get not only a converted 200-year-old fishing station, a bungalow and several hectares of land, but also the ruin of a castle thought once to have been inhabited by a notorious 15th-century cannibal. The Aberdeenshire coastal location complete with a beautifully renovated bungalow is in stark contrast to the grisly history of Kaim of Mathers Castle which was once home to 5th century Laird James Barclay. Perched precariously on the cliff edge the ruins are included in the three hectares of land that comes with the main property. The ruins of cannibal laird James Barclay castle, bottom left, are for sale along with three hectares of land and a fully resorted former fishing station and bungalow overlooking the Aberdeenshire coastline . The 15th century laird Barclay was accused of eating the local sheriff and was banished by the king to spend the rest of his life at Kaim of Mathers 'poised between the land and sea on a cliff top near St Cyrus' According to local legend the cannibal laird often complained to King James I of Scotland about the sheriff who was detested by local landowners. It is said one day the king told him to 'go and make soup of the sheriff' and 'sup' him - a comment Barcley took quite literally. According to 'Portrait of a Parish' by Duncan Fraser, Barcley and other lairds from the area tricked the sheriff into a day's hunting before tipping him into a boiling cauldron. One by one each lord 'had a sup of the broth'. When the King found out he denied any involvement in the brutal killing and denounced those who took part. He swore an oath that Barclay 'would get no peace to live neither on land nor sea for the rest of his life'. The cannibal laird spent the rest of his life at Kaim of Mathers 'poised between the land and sea on a cliff top near St Cyrus'. Built into a hollow at the top of the cliffs, Rock Hall has been transformed from a working fishing station with skipper's quarters, net store, two crewmen's bothies and a vaulted ice house into one large five-bedroom family home . The buyers brochure states: 'Rock Hall Fishing Station and Bungalow was bought as a ruin in 1998, it was comprehensively restored and turned into a family home by current owners Andrew and Annie Hamilton. Dating from around the late 18th century, Rock Hall was run as a salmon fishing station for around 200 years' The stunning ruin with the ghoulish history comes with a historic fishing station which has been converted into a family home over nine levels and a three bedroom bungalow. The properties are just one mile from St Cyrus beach. Agents Strut and Parker said the two properties can be sold as one lot on separately .

"Edwin 'Ed' Hale, Sr, sleeps on his 186-acre property over Chesapeake Bay with a sawed-off shotgun always within reach. It's not burglars the former Bank of Baltimore chairman worries about at night, but enemies who may have learned he spent time working undercover for the CIA. The Wall Street Journal reports that Hale, 68, broke his silence in a self-published book about his CIA work in a story similar to Hollywood spy Jack Ryan's escapades in 'Shadow Recruit.' In from the cold: Former bank executive Ed Hale, 68, spoke about his work as a spy for the CIA, operating a dummy company for the agency and giving cover to operatives working abroad . Baltimore Magazine reports that Hale was recruited by 'Buzzy' Krongard back in 1992. Krongard, the head of investment bank Alex. Brown who worked in the same office as Hale, also happened to be a banker working in the employ of the CIA. After being recruited, Hale says he helped run a dummy company the CIA created under a legitimate corporation under his control that had shipping and trucking operations. Hale traveled to countries including Saudi Arabia, Israel, Poland, Denmark and Norway to help provide cover to operatives supposedly working for the company. Hale's role, which was never officially associated with the US government, was key during a campaign in the 1990s when the CIA was conducting early investigations on Osama bin Laden. During operations, he would know only the agents' names and destinations, though he often communicated with a handler from the agency. Spy games: Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is about a Marine who joins a Wall Street brokerage as a cover story for his work for the CIA . Hale said he'd become a 'little nervous' his name would be revealed when agents did not return from missions at the pre-determined time, though he believes none were ever caught. Though rarely in danger, Hale said he once had a close shave with Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service, while in Jerusalem. 'I was in Israel with one of the agents, and he was on his way to other places in the Middle East,' he told Baltimore Magazine. 'I was at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, and they came in and grabbed me out of a meeting and took me and interrogated me and let me go because I was not there for Israel, I was there shepherding somebody through into other countries,' he added. Coming clean: Hale recruited Baltimore journalist Kevin Cowherd to write the book that revealed the secrets about his CIA work . The work stopped after September 11, 2001, when Hale says the agency no longer needed him, though he is still in communication with two of the agents he worked with. Part of the reason to commission the book, which was written by Baltimore journalist Kevin Cowherd and titled Hale Storm, was to give his children a reason for his absence during their childhood. 'I want my kids to know where I was and what I did,' he said, and both him and his two daughters say the book helped improve their relationship. 'It was very cathartic,' he said about the book, which has sold around 600 copies so far. 'To hold a secret like that for so long to yourself, it was difficult.' The man who brought him into the spy agency was less pleased for the Hale family after the revelation. 'I am disappointed and upset that Ed would violate his agreement and understanding with the agency,' Krongard told the Journal. Hale is the owner of professional indoor soccer team Baltimore Blast and started the barge and trucking companies Port East Transfer and Hale Container Line. He said he entered banking after the Bank of Baltimore turned him down for a loan, which raised his hackles due to the 'snooty blue-blood culture' of the industry. Afterwards, in 1991, a friend urged him to spend $1.4million on a successful proxy fight that put Hale in the position of chief executive of Bank of Baltimore.","Ed Hale, Sr, the 68-year-old former chairman of the Bank of Baltimore worked for the CIA in the 1990s and early 2000s .

"A Sudanese-born man accused along with his twin brother and two teenage boys of gang raping a 16-year-old girl near a council library in south-western Sydney has walked free on bail. Hassan Kugor, 20, is charged with his brother, Hussein, and two unnamed boys of luring the teenager girl from outside the Liverpool Council Library to a car park on a Saturday night in June last year. The girl was using the council's free wifi at around 9pm on June 31, 2014, when the group of six young men of African appearance approached and struck up a conversation with her. Sudanese-born twin brothers Hassan and Hussein Kugor, 20, are accused with other young men of luring a 16-year-old girl from outside Liverpool Library (pictured) last June to a nearby car park stairwell where she was raped and robbed of her mobile phone . They allegedly invited her to meet up with a mutual acquaintance and lured her to the nearby council car park stairwell, where two of the males raped her. Two of the young men were just 16 years old. The gang stole the young woman's mobile phone, forcing the traumatised teenager to return to the library’s forecourt and notify a bystander. A month later, police charged Hassan Kugor and the two teenage boys with aggravated sexual assault and robbery in company. Kugor denies sexually assaulting the teenager, but on Tuesday the NSW Supreme Court heard that DNA evidence relating to him formed part of a strong prosecution brief  in what Justice David Davies said was 'a shocking case'. Crown prosecutors opposed bail, arguing there were concerns Kugor would reoffend and that he posed a risk to the safety of the victim and the community. Kugor's father offered a $5000 surety for his son, who will live while on bail with a middle-aged family friend at Blacktown in western Sydney, and adhere to a nightly curfew between 8pm and 6am, avoid the victim, his five co-accused and the Liverpool area, except for legal visits. The court heard he had strong community ties, a partner of several years and a seven-month-old son. 'He has a minimal criminal history,' Justice Davies said. Kugor, who has been in custody since July, is due to appear with his brother at Liverpool Local Court on February 11.","Hassan Kugor, 20, is accused of gang raping a teenage girl last year .

"A total of five possible Republican presidential candidates have now entered the minefield of vaccine politics, with Ben Carson, Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina joining in the fight launched Monday by Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Rand Paul. The scrum grew as news emerged that President Barack Obama's $4 trillion 2016 budget proposal cut $50 million from federal government vaccination programs. Fiorina, a former CEO of Hewlett-Packard who is busily burnishing her conservative credentials in advance of the 2016 race, said 'parents have to make choices for their family and their children' about whether to have them immunized against measles, mumps, rubella and other deadly diseases. She spoke to a Buzzfeed writer last month. 'I think vaccinating for measles makes a lot of sense. But that's me,' Fiorina said. 'I do think parents have to make those choices. I mean, I got measles as a kid. We used to all get measles ... I got chicken pox, I got measles, I got mumps.' Scroll down for video . Carly Fiorina, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, said she supports parents' 'choices' in whether or not to vaccinate their children . SILLINESS: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz defended New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Tuesday, saying it was 'silliness to suggest either of them wanted to leaev children without immunizations against deadly diseases . Dr. Ben Carson, another possible 2016 presidential candidate, carefully threaded the needle between libertarianism and public health – erring on the side of medical science . Buzzfeed published the interview on Monday, shortly after Christie insisted that governments should give parents 'some measure of choice' in the matter. Paul, an eye surgeon, stirred the pot hours later with a claim that he knew of cases of 'walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.' Carson, a world-renowned pediatric neurosurgeon before his retiement, tried to sidestep the controversy Monday night with a statement to reporters that leaned toward medical science. 'Although I strongly believe in individual rights and the rights of parents to raise their children as they see fit, I also recognize that public health and public safety are extremely important in our society,' he said. 'Certain communicable diseases have been largely eradicated by immunization policies in this country and we should not allow those diseases to return by foregoing safe immunization programs, for philosophical, religious or other reasons when we have the means to eradicate them.' Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told Daily Mail Online that every child should be vaccinated – but left the door open for parents with religious objections to say no. 'Most states include an exception clause for good faith religious convictions, and that’s an appropriate judgment for the states to make,' he told Daily Mail Online. 'But on the question of whether kids should be vaccinated, the answer is obvious, and there’s widespread agreement: of course they should. We vaccinate both our girls, and encourage all parents to do the same.' On Capitol Hill, Cruz told reporters that the sudden focus on the issue generated by Christie's gaffe 'is largely silliness stirred up by the media.' 'Nobody reasonably thinks Chris Christie is opposed to vaccinating kids other than a bunch of reporters who want to write headlines,' he said. America is facing a measles outbreak that has hit at least 102 people, including a large cluster centered on the Disneyland theme park in California. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most of the California cases involved children who never received the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella. House Speaker John Boehner said Tuesday morning during a press conference that 'I don't know that we need another law, but I do believe that all children ought to be vaccinated.' And Travis Considine, a spokesman for likely presidential contender and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, told Daily Mail Online that Perry backed efforts to boost vaccination numbers. 'Governor Perry strongly believes in protecting life and has sought to improve the health and well-being of Texans in a variety of ways,' the spokesman said, 'including increased immunization rates.' In 2003, at the height of the national smackdown over vaccinations and autism, Perry signed an executive order directing his government to adopt a comprehensive plan to increase immunization rates statewide. In a 'Today' show interview that aired Monday, President Barack Obama agreed that parents should vaccinate their kids: 'There is every reason to get vaccinated, but there aren't reasons to not.' That pronouncment left conservatives in a tricky spot. A YouGov poll published last week showed that Republicans are more likely than Democrats – by a 35-19 per cent margin – to believe parents should be permitted to opt out of government-mandated vaccines for their children. Concerns have run rampant sine the mid-1990s over thimerosol, a mercury-based preservative that was used in live vaccines until a decade ago. Anti-vaccine activists, relying on science that was later debunked, claimed the ingredient was tied to a spike in autism diagnoses. The biggest cheerleader for that idea was Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the lawyer-turned-green-avenger who also argued that a different, organic form of mercury was contaminating ocean fish. ACTUALLY ... the earth is somewhat egg-shaped and the sky is black – it only looks blue because of hwo the atmosphere interacts with light. But Hillary Clinton's larger point is sound: Vaccines work . ANTI-VACCINE GODFATHER: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (center) posed with his mother Ethyl (right) and Hillary Clinton (left) at last year's 'RFK Ripple of Hope' gala; Kennedy, mroe than anyone else, was responsible for spreading the discredited theory that vaccines cause autism . Kennedy wrote a conspiracy-minded article in 2005, published in print by Rolling Stone and online by Salon.com, in which he claimed scientists and government agencies were colluding with vaccine makers to cover up evidence of a brain-wasting epidemic. Salon.com withdrew the article six years later and deleted it from its website, although copies have survived online elsewhere. Even though liberals originated the idea that vaccines caused autism, the fallout has left some conservatives who crusade against government overreach lining up behind discredited theories, and threatening to punish candidates who disagree. AsBuzzfeed's political editor explained on Monday, anti-vaccine advocacy remains largely 'a liberal fringe issue.' 'The people not vaccinating their kids against the diseases once declared defeated don't live in South Carolina or Indiana or a particularly conservative part of Ohio or Florida,' she wrote. 'The strongholds are in places like Newport Beach, Santa Monica, and Marin County, California. The affluent, the educated, the enlightened, the ones who believe in purity and science – people in liberal enclaves are the ones rejecting one of the 20th century's major scientific achievements.' After the facepalm moment: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (right) and his wife Mary Pat (center) posed Tuesday with Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne (left) as they arrived for lunch at number 11 Downing Street in London . Christie made his jaw-dropping statement Monday morning while touring a flu vaccine manufacturing facility in England. 'It's much more important, I think, what you think as a parent than what you think as a public official,' he said. 'I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well. So that's the balance that the government has to decide.' His spokesman blasted out a correction of sorts after the comment caught fire online. 'To be clear: The Governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated,' the qualification read. 'At the same time different states require different degrees of vaccination, which is why he was calling for balance in which ones government should mandate.' Christie wrote an open letter to New Jersey voters in 2009, saying he had 'met with families affected by autism' and heard 'their concern over New Jersey’s highest-in-the-nation vaccine mandates.' 'I stand with them now, and will stand with them as their governor in their fight for greater parental involvement in vaccination decisions that affect their children,' he wrote then. The Wall Street Journal editorial page castigated the governor on Monday night, pointing to 644 U.S. measles deaths last year in 2014, 'the most in a quarter-century.' Outbreaks like this year's measles cases 'are the result of plunging vaccinations rates,' the Journal opined, 'as more parents believe false information about vaccines, including claims that they cause autism.' Rand Paul ended up pushing forward and doubling down on his libertarian views in a CNBC interview. 'The state doesn't own your children,' he declared. 'Parents own the children, and it is an issue of freedom and public health.' Hillary Clinton, the Democrats' likely standard-bearer for 2016, tweeted Monday night that 'The science is clear: The earth is round, the sky is blue, and #vaccineswork. Let's protect all our kids. #GrandmothersKnowBest.' Daily Mail Online reached out to representatives of other potential presidential candidates, including Bobby Jindal, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. None of them responded to questions about vaccine politics.","Former Texas Gov.

"A Japanese man has been arrested for allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting more than 100 women by pretending they were taking part in a 'sleep study', local media reports.

Dozens of women responded to Noguchi's adverts seeking volunteers for 'clinical research measuring blood pressure during sleep'. Detectives say Noguchi lured the women to hotels and hot springs resorts where he gave them sedatives.

Noguchi is not know to have any medical training or expertise. A spokesman for Chiba police said officers had confirmed at least 39 victims in Tokyo, Chiba, Osaka, Tochigi and Shizuoka.

"As the Bali Nine masterminds await their executions in Bali, a notorious Indonesian police chief sentenced to 15 years imprisonment has walked out of jail and returned home to his family. The inequalities in the Indonesian prison system emerged when it was revealed on Tuesday afternoon that First Inspector Labora Sitorus, who was jailed last year for illegal logging and fuel hording, was refusing summons to go back to prison. The revelation followed Monday's decision by the Indonesian government that Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be in the next group of death row prisoners to be executed. Scroll down for video . Indonesia's First Inspector Labora Sitorus walked out of jail after being sentenced to 15 years prison . The Bali Nine ringleaders, who are currently in their death row cells in Bali's Kerobokan Prison, have no hope of the same 'walk out' freedom the police inspector has experienced. Inspector Sitorus told senior police in the region’s capital, Jayapura, that he had been lawfully released by prison officials - and waved a letter at them claiming it was his official release document, reported the Jakarta Globe. Brigadier General Paulus Waterpauw, chief of West Papua Police, told the Jakarta Globe today that Sitorus had met two senior police officers at his home and he had refused to return to the jail with them. ‘He claims he has been released,’ said General Waterpauw. ‘Strangely, Labora has so far not been dismissed from the police force and apparently was allowed to leave prison in March 2014 for health reasons,’ said the Globe. The Inspector was sentenced to eight years in prison for laundering $132 million, which was then revised to 15 years by the Supreme Court after he walked out of jail, reported the Jakarta Globe. Indonesia's attorney-general has confirmed Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan are in the next group of death row prisoners to be executed . Chan was arrested at the age of 21 for his role in the Bali Nine drug smuggling ring . ‘He has not returned since and is now using a document from Sorong Penetentiary as proof that he doesn’t have to,' said General Waterpauw. The General said that Inspector Sitorus was being protected by his family at his house, and that police were unable to forcefully take him to prison. ‘There are some of his relatives standing guard for him’ said the Police General. ‘Not many, but we do not want this to lead to a clash. And there’s nothing we can do because he has a release letter.’ Attorney General Muhammad Prasetyo, who announced on Monday that Chan and Sukumaran would be in the next round of executions, 'indicated' that an investigation would be launched. Inspector Sitorus' actions blatantly defy a Supreme Court ruling, reported news portal Detik.com. ‘That’s what we need to find out - why he was released,’ Attorney General Prasetyo said. The families of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran (seen as a child in picture above) are pleading for mercy . Myruan Sukumaran's mother Raji, (far right) and his siblings Chinthu (left) and Brintha (right) arrived at Kerobokan prison on Australia Day . Michael Chan , visited his brother, Andrew Chan, in prison on both Sunday (left) and Monday (right) ‘The penetentiary has no authority to release him.’ The anomalies between the actions of the Police Inspector and the permanent incarceration of the Bali nine kingpins raises questions regarding the maintenance of control and equality within the Indonesian prison system. Chan and Sukumaran have been on death row since 2006 and family and friends say they have totally reformed themselves since being behind bars. Under a ruling by Indonesia's Constitutional Court, a judicial review - which Chan and Sukumaran had asked for - could only be heard if new evidence is able to be presented. But lawyers for the two men had pleaded for a second judicial review based on the way the the prisoners had changed since their drug arrests, pointing out they had helped many other prisoners. Their application for a second judicial review, accepted by the courts on Friday, included handwritten pleas from the men, and accounts of their rehabilitation behind bars at Bali's Kerobokan jail. Indonesia's Attorney-General Mr Prasetyo said planning was underway for the executions: 'We're just waiting for the right time.' Chan and Sukumaran (above) are scheduled for execution and could face the firing squad next week .","Indonesia's First Inspector was jailed in 2014 for illegal logging, fuel hording and laundering $132 million .

The perforated skull belongs to a mummified woman found in the Xiaohe tomb in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Experts said that the hole, which measures around 2 inches (50mm) in diameter,  was most likely an early form of craniotomy. The perforated skull (pictured) was discovered as part of a mummified body of a woman in the 'Little River' Xiaohe tomb complex.  Experts said that the hole, measuring around 2 inches (50mm) in diameter, was most likely an early form of craniotomy - a procedure that involves removing bone to get access to the brain . A craniotomy involves temporarily removing a 'flap' of bone from the skull to give surgeons access to the brain. The amount of skull removed depends on the type of surgery being performed, and the flap is later replaced using screws. It may have also been a form of trepanation, which involves the removal of a piece of bone from the skull. This procedure has been performed since prehistoric times, and cave paintings indicate that ancient people believed the practice would cure epileptic seizures, headaches and mental disorders. The wound suggests that the female (pictured), who died in her 40s, must have lived for at least a month, or even longer, after receiving the surgery . Lead archaeologist Zhu Hong who made the discovery said: '[The wound] suggests the female, who died in her 40s, must have lived for at least a month, or even longer, after receiving the surgery.' He added there were also signs of healing tissues around the wound. The mummy dates back to 1,615 BC and is one of hundreds discovered in the Xiaohe 'Little River' Tomb complex. Lying 108 miles (175 km) west of the ancient city of Loulan, the site was first explored in 1934 by Swedish archaeologist Folke Bergman, but not fully excavated until 2005. Dating of the area has shown it goes back to approximately 2,000 BC, although tests have revealed the bodies contain DNA from the east and west. In particular, males were found to have chromosomes typically found in Northern and Eastern Europe, alongside DNA found in Siberia. The massive burial site has more than 330 graves and contains the largest number of mummies ever found in the world. These tombs include adults and children as well as 15 intact mummies, although approximately half of the tombs were said to have been looted by grave robbers. The majority of the coffins found on the site were made of wood, and were shaped like boats, buried upside down.

The oldest samples of skulls with bore holes drilled into them were found in a burial site in France dating back to 6500 BC. But it was also used by the Ancient Egyptians, Chinese, Indians, Romans, Greeks and the early Mesoamerican civilizations. Even the 'father of medicine' Hippocrates advocated the process in his 400 BC tome 'On Injuries of the Head'. Modern exponents say it increases blood flow in the brain, increasing lucidity and heightening brain function. This practice is similar to how the Egyptians believed boats would take Pharaohs to the land of the ‘Gods’ Clothes and jewellery found in the tomb were also buried alongside the mummies, in small baskets, and the bodies were wrapped in cowhide and wool. This prevented sand from getting inside the corpses. In addition to the wood coffins, four clay-covered rectangular coffins were also found, surrounded by stakes. And six of the coffins were found to contain wooden 'bodies', rather than corpses. Each of these wooden sculptures were the same shape and were designed to look like males. Sexual iconography was everywhere at the site, with posts representing phalluses and vulvas placed in front of each grave. Last week, scientists recreated ancient brain surgery to understand medical techniques that existed almost 2,500 years ago. A team of experts in Russia spent the past year examining skulls found with intricate surgical holes in a bid to fathom out how early nomadic doctors carried out their work.

The procedure was carried out by Aleksei Krivoshapkin according to ancient methods used in the Altai Mountains on the skull of a woman who had died of natural causes shortly before. Analysis of the skulls of ancient patients found that the operations were carried out with only one tool, a bronze knife, with the surgeons carefully scraping at the skull, yet leaving behind only minimal traces of their work.","The 3,600-year-old perforated skull belongs to a mummified woman .

"Possible dangers: An American Academy of Pediatrics report in 2013 listed marijuana among the most common drugs involved in prenatal exposure that may pose important health risks . Marijuana use by pregnant or nursing women might seem like a no-brainer of a bad idea, but a proposal in Colorado to step up such warnings is raising concern because of limited research on the dangers. Pot users in Colorado and Washington already receive warnings that the drug shouldn't be used by pregnant and nursing women. But a Colorado bill facing its first hearing on Tuesday proposes going further by requiring pot shops to post signs saying that maternal marijuana use poses risks to unborn children. 'It's important to have notification that there is risk,' said Republican Rep. Jack Tate, sponsor of the bill. The proposal is controversial. Some pregnant women use marijuana to ease nausea, and a marijuana industry group fears the warnings don't acknowledge limited research on pot use by mothers-to-be. Tyler Henson, president of the Colorado Cannabis Chamber of Commerce, called the proposal 'another attempt to discredit and ignore the popular public opinion of marijuana's medicinal use.' A Colorado health report issued this week notes that marijuana's psychoactive ingredient, THC, is passed to children through the placenta and breast milk. But the doctors who compiled the survey of existing research also noted that the health consequences of that THC exposure aren't fully understood. Dangers: If the bill passes, Marijuana shops in Colorado will need to post a sign like this that spells out marijuana risks to pregnant mothers . The report's authors found: . Bill sponsor: 'It's important to have notification that there is risk,' said Republican Rep. Jack Tate, sponsor of the proposed bill to make marijuana shops warn mothers of the harm marijuana can cause unborn children . 'Mixed' evidence for pot's link to birth defects; . 'Insufficient' evidence that marijuana use during pregnancy makes offspring more likely to use pot themselves as adolescents; . 'Moderate' evidence that maternal use of marijuana during pregnancy is associated with attention problems, cognitive impairment or low IQ in offspring; and . 'Mixed' evidence that marijuana use during pregnancy is associated with low birth weight. Still, the doctors concluded, 'There is no known safe amount of marijuana use during pregnancy.' The report, released on Monday, reflected national conclusions on marijuana's health risks. An American Academy of Pediatrics report in 2013 listed marijuana among the most common drugs involved in prenatal exposure that may pose important health risks, including possible behavior and attention problems in childhood. The National Institute on Drug Abuse says animal studies have suggested that smoking marijuana in pregnancy may harm brain development. But the institute also says more research is needed 'to disentangle marijuana's specific effects from other environmental factors, including maternal nutrition, exposure to nurturing/neglect, and use of other substances by mothers.' Colorado, one of four states that have legalized recreational use of pot, requires marijuana to carry labels saying, among other things, 'There may be additional health risks associated with the consumption of this product for women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning on becoming pregnant.' In Washington state, marijuana purchasers are given warnings that include the statement, 'Should not be used by women that are pregnant or breastfeeding.'","'It's important to have notification that there is risk,' said Republican Rep.

"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie canceled planned availabilities with reporters in London on Tuesday after his comments on vaccinations sparked a political flap at home. The Republican governor and likely presidential contender had originally been scheduled to address the press three times during the final day of his three-day trip to the United Kingdom. Instead, the availabilities vanished from his schedule, which included lunch with the chancellor of the exchequer and a visit to the famous Globe Theatre. 'Is there something you don't understand about, ""No questions""?' Christie snapped when a reporter asked whether he'd discussed the Islamic State group during his meetings with dignitaries during the visit to the Globe. Scroll down for video . 'NO QUESTIONS!' New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (center left, dodging reporters) canceled three separate media availa bilities on his calendar Tuesday at the tail end of a difficult PR exercise in the UK . CONTROLLED: Christie (right) and his wife Mary Pat smiled for cameras after a meeting with British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne outside No 11 Downing street Tuesday in London . SHAKESPEARE NEVER GOT THE MEASLES: The Christies watched a rehearsal during their visit to the Globe theatre in London . 'We're just not having press availability today,' his communications chief Maria Comella said when asked for an explanation. Billed as an official trade mission, the trip doubled as a chance for Christie, a likely presidential contender, to broaden his foreign policy resume and build relationships with world leaders. But coverage of the trip has been dominated by remarks he made Monday after touring a pharmaceutical facility, that parents 'parents need to have some measure of choice' when it comes to whether to vaccinate their children. Christie's office quickly backtracked, releasing a statement that declared that, 'with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated.' But the comments drew scorn, first across social media, and then from medical professionals, newspaper editorial boards and national Democrats, who accused the governor of ignoring medical science. BINDERS FULL OF BRITONS: Mitt Romney failed to establish his foreign policy bona fides during a 2012 UK trip, insulting his hosts by suggesting they weren't ready to stage the summer olympics . A measles outbreak centered in California has sickened more than 100 people, focusing attention on parents who choose not to vaccinate their children. Some do so for religious or philosophical reasons, while others cite a concern that vaccines can lead to autism and developmental disorders – a link debunked by rigorous medical research. Trips to London have sometimes been problematic for Republican presidential contenders. Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee, angered officials here when he suggested that they weren't prepared for the upcoming Olympic games. And Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal stirred controversy in January when he told a think tank audience that some countries allowed Muslims to establish autonomous 'no-go zone' neighborhoods in cities where they govern by a harsh version of Islamic law. British Prime Minister David Cameron had called such assertions bunk. CANCELED: Christie left reporters high and dry on Tuesday, replacing open press conferences with closed meetings and events . TROUBLE: Christie started a national furor on Monday with his comments about childhood vaccines nad never managed to escape tough follow-up questions about whether parents should be allowed to opt out . Christie's final day included a visit to a drug treatment center for women, where he encouraged members of his party at home to show more compassion to addicts, as well as a performance by students studying at the Globe Theatre, which houses an exchange program with New Jersey's Rutgers University. His original schedule had included two 'gaggle' opportunities where reporters can ask questions as well as planned 'brief remarks' after a lunch with George Osborne, the chancellor of the exchequer, outside 11 Downing Street. The remarks were indeed brief. 'We had a lot of fun,' Christie responded to shouted questions as he bypassed waiting microphones and marched to his waiting car.","New Jersey governor replaced a trio of scheduled open-press availabilities with closed events instead .

"A Texas nine-year-old's family plan to move out of the state if she can't be medicated with cannabis for her seizures. Alexis Bortell's seizures strike about twice a week, and though they're non-violent, they are still serious and other drugs don't seem to help. Alexis, from Rowlett, Texas, is unable to ride a bike or sleep over at friends' houses because adults who can administer her emergency relief medicine must always be present in case she has an episode. Alexis Bortell, 9, is fighting to legalize cannabis oil in Texas. She has the backing of a State Senator and State Representative who have bills that they hope to get to committee. If they reach committee, Alexis will testify . Alexis's story has attracted attention across Texas as two Republican lawmakers in Texas introduced bills to approve the legalization of medical marijuana in the form of cannabis oil . Alexis's seizures strike about twice a week, and though they're nonviolent, they are still serious and drugs don't seem to help . Alexis has been given a number of drugs in an attempt to reduce episodes, but they gave her side effects including tremors, spasms and personality changes, and the seizures still remained, according to the National Monitor. Her family relies on emergency relief medicine that is administered after she has a seizure. But Alexis and her family believe cannabis - which is illegal in Texas - just might help reduce her seizures. Her story has attracted attention across the state as two Republican lawmakers introduced a bill that would approve the legalization of medical marijuana in the form of cannabis oil, according to WFAA. 'Medical cannabis will help me. It's illegal in Texas and we're trying to change that,' Alexis said. The bills are sponsored by Republican State Sen. Kevin Eltife and Republican State Rep. Stephanie Klick. If their bill for cannabis oil is passed in its original form, the use of the substance will be regulated by the Texas Department of Public Safety instead of the Department of State Health Services. Dean Bortell, Alexis's father, said that he is unsure if the cannabis oil will work, but he feels like he's failed her, knowing there's something out there that could help the seizures that they can't get access to because of their ZIP code.

Bortell, a conservative Christian, said that the family will move to Colorado if the bill is not passed in May. Since Alexis already has a card that will allow her to obtain cannabis oil in Colorado, Bortell told WFAA that they plan to begin treating Alexis in late June. Alexis has yet to try cannabis oil because her father is worried that she might get tested by the Texas Department of Protective Services because she has a high-profile position on the issue. She plans to explain her experiences and seizures before lawmakers if the bills reach policy committee.

"They say breaking up is never easy and for Rex Ryan it proved to be a particularly painful split. When the NFL coach had a racy tattoo of his wife inked on his arm, wearing nothing but a New York Jets jersey, it was supposed to be a touching gesture to his team.
